A reporter who found no Santa Claus In Belfast returned there with gifts from a woman In Illinois to prove that St. Nick remains alive . Sec. 3 , p. 14 . By Ray Moseley FOR MORE YEARS than she can remember , 02-year-old Pearl Miller has observed the same Christmas morning ritual . Long before most people are awake , she gets up , has breakfast In her home on the South Side , and then Ls off to Cook County Jail to help bring some of the joy she feels to the men and women behind bars . " It keeps my spirits up , " she said . " There 's no use In falling down and not doing anything because you 're old . " MRS . MILLER Is the mother of the Rev.

" I 'll be there with my daughter , " Mrs. Miller said . " I push the gift cart awhile , and then I sit down . I look at tho , e boys and eirls in their cells and I say to myself , ' You just put yourself in lithe , nobody did it for you . ' But when people get in that shape , they need help . " Some women on welfare even use part of their food stamps , according to the Rev. Mrs. York , to prepare homecooked meals for the prisoners . " When you know that you 've helped somebody , then the Lord sees to your welfare , " said the 63-year-old pastor , who donates much of her own money to helping the prisoners throughout the year .

" THROUGHOUT THE Chicago area this Christmas , people like Mrs. Miller and the Rev. Mrs. York will give up family holiday celebrations , or defer them , for what they believe are greater pleasures  --  seeing a child 's face light up in a hospital ward ; bringing comfort to an old person who otherwise would spend the day alone ; or helping a derelict from Skid Row to enjoy a turkey dinner . The numbers of such volunteers are not legion , but there may he more of them than many people realize , for they do not as a rule seek publicity . Some expressed embarrassment at being contacted by The Tribune and only reluctantly consented to be interviewed . The Rev. Mrs. York operates her church from a condemned building she took over on the South Side . As she spoke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack gifts for the prisoners . She would n't give her name , but said she was on welfare . " I 'm not able to give money but I give of my time , " she said . " I do this out of my heart because I love Jesus and I like to help people . I give all of my time to Rev. York and the Lord . " ON THAT SAME ( lay this week , Capt . John Larsen , assistant director of publicity for the Salvation Army , was in his office when a woman of like mind phoned . She said that the night before she , her husband , and their two children had taken a vote and decided they wanted to give up their Christmas to help others . " It was unreal , " he said afterward . " I 've never heard of any family sitting down and taking a vote like that . " So instead of opening presents under the tree , this family , which declined to be interviewed , planned to spend Christmas at the Salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving dinner to drug addicts and alcoholics . FOREGOING THE traditional Christmas at home will be a new experience for them , but not for the Robert E. Anderson family of Lake Forest . Six years ago , Mrs. Ann Anderson saw a notice on the bulletin board at RushPresbyterian-St . Luke 's Medical Center , where she does volunteer work , asking for Christmas Day volunteers . " I went home , told my family , and they all thought it was a terrific idea , " she said . The Andersons have made a regular Christmas pilgrimage to the hospital since , and last year started going on Christmas Eve as well to the Sheridan Pavilion of the hospital at 6130 N. Sheridan Rd . Robert Anderson is an official of the Security Columbian Bank Note Co . Their children include Margaret , 21 ; Robert Jr. , 19 ; and Kathryn , 26 , who has come home from her job with a New York bank to join them at the hospital as usual . THE ANDERSONS make the rounds of the hospital wards , stop to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That adds up to about 600 carnations . Tile Andersons find out which patients will be alone all day and , after completing their rounds , go back to spend extra time with these patients . Robert Jr . takes his guitar and plays for the children in the pediatrics ward . Afterward they go to a church service , and then Anderson takes the family out to dinner . When do they open their Christmas presents ? " If you say Christmas to the Anderson children , they do n't think of presents , " Mrs. Anderson said . " Presents are not involved . They get presents at other times of the year . Our family always has had Christmas every day of the year . We have always felt we were very fortunate people . " CHRISTMAS ALSO brings together Mrs. Alice Leahy of Countryside and her son , Patrick , 22 , an Indian Head Park policeman , in an unlikely setting  --  the Electricians Hall at 600 W. Washingtor St. , where Catholic Charities provides dinner for the men of Skid Row . Normally her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job as a nurse 's aide at a senior citizen 's home took precedence . It is the first time she has missed the party since she was in the 8th grade . MRS . LEAHY , who counsels alcoholics at the University of Illinois Hospital , has spent her Christmases at the Skid Row party for 15 years . Most of the regulars know her , and some even sent her cards when they heard she was sick . " We serve over 900 men , " she said . " Naturally , they are down because they drink . But they are human beings , and really need help . I do n't have any money to give , but maybe in this small way I 'm contributing something for all the good I 've gotten out of life . " Patrick Leahy will be helping at the party from about 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. , then will go to his police job at 4 p.m. , so he even will miss the family Christmas dinner later in the day , his mother said .

Mrs. Rodna Nye , 860 Lake Shore Dr. , will lead about 15 women from the American Women 's Voluntary Services in serving Christmas breakfast and dinner to an expected 800 servicemen at the USO Center , 69 E. Randolph St. She said she has done this for 35 years " I feel as old as Ft . Sheridan " and her husband , Walter , who owns a housewares agency , pitches in and helps . They work from 8 a.m. to 0 p.m. and never get around to a Christmas of their own . " We do n't think much about that , " she said . " This is our Christmas , really . " ?

" We do n't get a response out ' of people to do good , " she said . " We participate out of a sense of what we can get out of it , of what people in the hospitals do to put us in touch with the holiday spirit . " She said some est members took their children along last Christmas " and they are insisting on going this year . They just love it . " AT NORTHWESTERN Memorial Hospital 's Wesley Pavilion , some of the Christian volunteers who work throughout the year will get to spend Christmas at home with their families because about 20 members of the Congregation Kol Ami Synagog , 255 E. Ontario St. , have volunteered to relieve them . Rabbi Arnold Kaiman said the program began five years ago , with Northwestern providing a short training course beforehand for the Jewish volunteers . But other Chicago-area hospitals have not been so willing to accept Jewish volunteers at Christmas , according to Gerald Dicker , Chicago director of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B'nai B'rith volunteers worked at Cook County Hospital . But Dicker said that when they offered their services the next Christmas , the director declined with thanks . " He said we were more trouble than we were worth , " Dicker said . " He told us we were not really relieving anybody , and we were in the way . " B'nai B'rith approached ether hospitals but in each case was told that there were complications over insurance coverage for the volunteers and over their lack of training . " I think that is most unfortunate , " Dicker said .
