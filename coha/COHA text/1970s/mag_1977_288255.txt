Each fall the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center serves as a 2-week primer on the state of world cinema . This year , as usual , there is a heavy emphasis on big-name European directors ( Bertolucci , Bu ? uel , Pasolini , Bresson ) , a shortage of American movies , and a sprinkling of exotic entries from underdeveloped nations . Only a few of the festival films are immediately released elsewhere . Among them : <P> <P> Short Eyes Shot at " the Tombs " house of detention in New York City , this film offers a brutally honest slice of prison life , and it is completely devoid of the mawkish hand wringing that has characterized most other American jailhouse movies . There are no bad-guy guards to hiss at , no latter-day Birdmen of Alcatraz to root for . Writer Miguel Pinero , who served five years at Sing Sing for armed robbery and is currently under indictment for other crimes , asks the audience to see his characters for exactly what they are . <P> The film 's documentary-style depiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fascinating , but it is Short Eyes ' title character who gives the film its thrust . " Short Eyes " is prison slang for child molester , the one kind of felon all the others deplore , and when Prisoner Clark Davis ( Bruce Davison ) arrives at the Tombs , the moral and emotional tensions of the cell block are brought into powerful relief . Like Eugene O'Neill 's Iceman , Davis is a crackerjack theatrical device ; thanks to Davison 's finely shaded performance , he is also the most disturbing character in a film full of blistered souls . <P> The other performances are fairly good too , but Short Eyes ca n't always camouflage its origins as a one-set play : there are too many theatrical monologues that stop the movie dead , and there is a forced climax that is almost a parody of third act curtain scenes . Director Robert M. Young ( Nothing but a Man ) does , however , convey the authentic pain in Pinero 's script , and it really stings . <P> The Man Who Loved Women is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technician who guiltlessly pursues a life of one-night stands . Like so many of Franois Truffaut 's melancholy comedies , this film deals with the impossibility of monogamous love : Bertrand sleeps with dozens of women because he knows there is no one woman who can offer him complete fulfillment . Eventually he writes a memoir about his exploits-a Story of Adele H. in reverse , one might say-and dies happy . <P> The film is strewn with lyrical Truffaut conceits ( including some giddy montages of women 's legs ) , as well as a few comic seduction scenes , but it is arguably the shallowest of this great director 's works . In Truffaut 's best movies , such as Jules and Jim and Stolen Kisses , the heroes struggle mightily with the eternal conflicts of love , and the audience is all the wiser for living through their torment . <P> This time there is no struggle and no enlightenment : Bertrand is just a flip Don Juan-a stock comic figure who resolves all of life 's dilemmas by retreating to adolescence . Despite Denner 's amusingly self-effacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worse still , the women he damages along his selfish way . Truffaut 's vulnerability and sweet tragic sense are strangely absent here ; this film is just depressing .
