At eight , he was learning to drive by backing the car out of the family garage in Sao Paulo . He was building and racing go-karts at 15 , speedy competition cars by the time he was 20 . At 22 , he put together $3,300 and left Brazil for Britain to break into big-time European racing . Today , little more than three years later , Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi is the most successful race-car driver in the world . Last week he wheeled his Lotus around the 3.51-mile track at Monza , Italy , to win both the Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix and 1972 's World Championship of Drivers. + At 25 , he is the youngest driver ever to earn that title . <P> In Grand Prix racing , there is a tendency , sometimes justifiable , to credit victory to the car rather than the driver . Fittipaldi has proved that he can win even with autos that lack a racer 's edge .

His mother , who named her son after Ralph Waldo Emerson , has raced sports cars . His older brother Wilson , 28 , also races on the Grand Prix circuit . The elder Fittipaldis tried to interest their sons in a less violent form of racing-in sailboats . It did not work . " We always finished last , " Emerson remembers . " We were a disaster sailing . " Last is a position Emerson is not likely to see in his accelerating career on the road . <P> <P> +The winner is determined by the total points collected in twelve Grand Prix races .
