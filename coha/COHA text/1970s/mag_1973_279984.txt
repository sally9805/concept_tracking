IN public , the Nixon Administration professes serene confidence in its economic strategy . But backstage , a gnawing unease is growing . Indeed , President Nixon has recently called on his advisers , and some outside economists , to suggest alternatives to the tattered anti-inflation policy of Phase III . From board room to checkout counter , public pressure is building for some decisive action to deal with an economy that seems to have spun out of control into the kind of inflationary binge that historically precedes recession . <P> Signs of this economic runaway proliferate regularly . New ones last week : <P> Manhattan 's First National City Bank reported that its latest survey of corporate profits showed them rising a huge 24% , after taxes , in the first quarter . Earnings on each dollar of sales rose too-to 5.7% , or .5% more than a year ago , by one preliminary estimate . Generally , high profits are good news : they fuel the engine of a free-enterprise economy . But in this case , the gains are one more sign of an overheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wage-price spiral whirling again by prompting labor leaders to make outsize pay demands . <P> Union men already are vocally angry about the economic situation .

Meany singled out a New York Times article signed by Budget Director Roy Ash , which offers a series of glowing statistics and assertions . <P> Most are at worst debatable or subject to varying interpretations , but one is simply wrong .

The article was written in the White House publicity mill , which called the inaccuracy a " typing error . " <P> Ash also contended that " confidence for the future is high " - but last week the University of Michigan Survey Research Center reported the sharpest drop in consumer confidence in the 22 years that it has been taking soundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 to 80.8 in February and March of this year . Consumers are deeply afraid of both further inflation and future recession . Ironically , these very ideas are making people rush to buy appliances , cars and houses before prices go even higher and before bad times come ; such scare buying tends to prompt exactly the price boosts that consumers fear . Another index of confidence in the economy , the stock market , also took a pounding last week ; the Dow Jones industrial average fell 41 points , to a new 1973 low of 922 . <P> What can Nixon do to take charge of the economy and calm the groundswell of concern ? All the options open to him are to some extent unpalatable . <P> Theoretically , he could :
