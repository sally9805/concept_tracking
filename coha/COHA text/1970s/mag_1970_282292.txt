THE notion of teen-age gangs evokes memories of the ' 50s , of leather-jacketed youths sporting zip guns and garrison belts , of the Sharks and the Jets in the urban ballet that was West Side Story . To the residents of Chicago 's sprawling black ghetto , however , the images are more immediate and far more menacing . <P> As of June 24 of this year , there have been 38 gang-related homicides and 316 gang shootings with 398 wounded , most in the city 's black South Side . Last Friday , at one violence-ridden project , there were more fatalities-two policemen , walking the streets in a program to improve relations with the community , were gunned down by snipers . Among the black community , there is a growing recognition that the gangs are a cancer within their midst , that they must be stamped out and that no matter what the police and courts try to do , it is the blacks themselves who must ultimately solve the problem . <P> Such awareness has been long in coming . For years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a protective umbrella of white-liberal and black community support . Despite the formation of a special police gang intelligence unit , organizations like the Black P. Stone Nation ( formerly and more famously known as the Blackstone Rangers ) , the Black Disciples and the Vice Lords increased their memberships into the thousands and engaged in shooting sprees , beatings , extortion and intimidation . But for all that , adult black leaders did not criticize the gangs , visualizing them instead as an organized and potentially constructive force in the community . <P> Y.M.C.A. Support . So , too , did some of the white world . In 1967 , the Office of Economic Opportunity financed a job-training program for both Blackstone Rangers and Devil 's Disciples . The Kettering Foundation gave $50,000 for legal expenses for inner-city youths . A chapter of the Vice Lords known as the Conservative Vice Lords received Sears Foundation and Y.M.C.A. support in starting several small businesses in their area . Such prominent black personalities and longtime supporters of the gangs as Chicago Disk Jockey Holmes ( " Daddy-O " ) Daylie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization ( K.O.C.O. ) , helped provide jobs for gang members . But still the killings continued . <P> For Blacks Only . Initially , black criticism of the gangs had stemmed mainly from the parents of dead and injured children . Recently , however , even men like Daddy-O Daylie began to blow the whistle on tolerance . He had put black capitalism into action by acquiring two filling stations and part ownership in a bowling alley , then hired young blacks to help staff them . But Stones members approached him last summer and demanded he turn over one of the stations to their gang . When he refused , youths reported to be gang members began vandalizing and harrassing customers at his bowling alley . This year , a security guard at the lanes was shot three times by unidentified youths .
