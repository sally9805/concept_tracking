" I had been backed onto the stage unknowing , while the crowd roared . The obvious solution to this was the BBC , which sucks talent like bits of fluff into that big white building , where it 's safe forever . But I had my tattered pride . In fact , my whole array of virtues was intact ; only the man behind them was missing . I did n't really give a damn anymore whether I was English or American , but the U.S. was still the prairie of record , the place where the garbled soul of Chatworth could re-create itself . Or failing that , become famous . <P> Because , let 's face it , an Englishman in America was more impressive in those days than his clockwise counterpart . Before the cattle boats began disgorging secretaries , English voices were unheard between New York and the Gold Coast , and I had the best . So the old ladies who used to gush over my cute accent would now be made to pay through the nose for it . Young Chatworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flinch and try to hide that accent . Pah ! Does the bearded lady shave ? Does Tom Thumb lie about his height ? Use it , boy . Sell anything you 've got . "
