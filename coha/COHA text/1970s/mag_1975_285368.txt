<P> The scene : a Brazilian government outpost called Abunari Two , on the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin . There , recently , 27 Indians of the Waimiri and Atroari tribes emerged from the jungle . Ostensibly , they came to trade for food and medicine with Gilberto Pinto Figueiredo , an official of FUNAI , the government-run National Indian Foundation , but they were clearly angry about the building of new roads through their tribal lands . They came equipped with bows and arrows decorated with red macaw feathers , a symbol of war . Even after a supply of food and gifts arrived by plane , they remained dissatisfied and agitated . Early next morning , a fierce war cry brought Figueiredo rushing out of camp . As he approached Comprido , the Indian leader , he was fatally struck in the chest by two arrows . Before the skirmish was over and the Indians had retreated back into the bush , three other government officials lay dead . <P> In the past three months , Brazilian Indians have killed twelve people in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was set up to protect the country 's vanishing tribes . The attacks mark a desperate new stage in a struggle that began more than 300 years ago , when the Indians first resisted white men who were looking for gold , rubber and slaves in Brazil 's vast interior . Just since the turn of this century , more than 96 tribes have disappeared in the face of white expansion ; the country 's Indian population , which may once have been as high as 4 million , is today less than 100,000 . <P> The problem now is Brazil 's highway-building program , which is lacing the vast Amazon region with roads , including the trans-Amazon highway stretching 2,843 miles from Recife on the Atlantic Coast to the Peruvian border . <P> Last Refuge . Unfortunately , the Amazon Basin is the last refuge for tribes like the Waimiri and Atroari . " The Indians resent the speed and aggressiveness with which the road is being built , " says Joao Americo Peret , a Brazilian Indian expert . " But since they ca n't confront the road-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> FUNAI has tried to pacify the Indians by moving them to new lands away from the construction , but the tribes ' delicate social fabrics have often not survived . Last year , for example , the Kranhacarore Indians of Mato Grosso state were moved to a plot of land away from their ancestral area but still only a few miles from the new road . Within ten months , Indian men were begging on the construction sites . Eventually , the government had to transfer the demoralized Kranhacarore away from the construction sites to Mato Grosso 's 13,750 sq.mi . Xingu National Park . <P> Although Brazil has four national parks and 17 reservations set aside for the Indians , the tribes ' future is gloomy . Except for a few dedicated Indianists in FUNAI , Brazilians on the whole have never cared much for the Indians , viewing them as embarrassing and obstructive Stone Age remnants in an increasingly modern state . The Waimiris and Atroaris understand only too well that modern Brazil , with its population of 100 million , will encroach ever more rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway threatens to be more devastating than any of the slave traders or gold miners who upset their lives in the past .
