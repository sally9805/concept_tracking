THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AS the defeated British regiments marched past the files of French and American troops at Yorktown , the British bands , in de  --  tached resignation , played " The World Turned Upside Down . " The same tune would have been an appropriate accompaniment to the events of last week . For the two-hundred-year-old American system came under its most serious attack in modern times , not from the poor , the blacks , or the stu  --  dents but from the White House  --  the fount , the pinnacle , the keystone of the established order . President Nixon be  --  came the first President in the history of the United States deliberately to or  --  der American forces to invade another nation on his own , without seeking con  --  gressional approval or support . This or  --  der was in disregard of the Constitu  --  tion , the tempering strictures of our history , and the principles of the Amer  --  ican democracy . It was , therefore , an act of usurpation . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That docu  --  ment makes the President Commander  --  in-Chief , and explicitly states that only Congress shall have the power to de  --  clare war or raise armies . The Fed  --  eralist Papers reaffirm what the law makes clear : the term " Commander  --  in-Chief " meant only that the Presi  --  dent could direct the conflict after Congress had decided to make war . Hamilton wrote that the President 's power would he much less than the power of the British King , for " it would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces , as first General and Admiral of the Confed  --  eracy ; while that of the British King extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies  --  all which , by the Constitution under consideration , would appertain to the legislature . " This was no casual division . The fear of military power under the control of a central govern ? ment was one of the most serious pop  --  ular objections to the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , the founders responded , was by a " continued conspiracy " be  --  tween the executive and the legislature . In this case , Hamilton advised , " the people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands ... in or  --  der that they may he able to manage their own concerns in person . " As so  --  phisticated men , the Founding Fathers foresaw some of the dangers that la ) ahead . They recognized explicitly that formal declarations of war were going out of style , but they still required our legislature to declare war . They saw " how easy would it be to fabricate pretences of approaching danger , " but they said that this would demand " a combination between the executive and the legislative , in some scheme of usur  --  pation . " In other words , the Constitu  --  don would protect the American people against the misuse of military power by prohibiting the executive from going to war without congressional approval and prohibiting Congress from directing the war it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they acknowledged , but it was thi ? best that could he done . For over a hundred and sixty years , the Constitution was followed . Congress declared the War of 1812 , the Mexi  --  can War ( even though there had been a somewhat provoked attack on our troops ) , the Spanish-American War , and both World Wars . In the period after the Second World War , things began to change . The development of Soviet atomic power , the military im  --  potence of Western Europe , and the shock of Korea impelled its toward the creation of a large peacetime standing Army the first in our history . It was seen that it sudden emergency might re  --  quire instant action , with no time to go to Congress . This implied exception to Constitutional principle was based the technological realities of atomic war , and it has been invoked only once  --  when we intervened in the Do  --  minican Republic . That intervention , however , was based on the claim that action within hours was necessary to protect the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue operation This claim may well have masked other motives , but American forces were not committed to combat , and support of the congressional leadership was sought and received within hours of the order to intervene and before the Marines had actually landed . In Korea in 1950 , President Tru  --  man acted pursuant to a resolution of the Security Council , whose powers had been confirmed by the Senate when it consented to ratification of the United Nations Charter . In addition , Truman met with the congressional leadership of both parties before ordering combat forces into action , and he received their unanimous support , along with that of the defeated Republican nominee , Thomas Dewey . Nor was there any doubt of the overwhelming public and congressional approval of his action-  --  at least in the beginning . ( The same week , the draft was extended with only four dissenting votes . ) President Eisen  --  hower sought , and received , congres  --  sional resolutions authorizing him to act in the Middle East and in the Formosa Strait . President Johnson himself asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident , and it was the liter  --  al verbal scope of this resolution that was construed as authorizing all subse  --  quent action in Vietnam . Yet such a construction was clearly an evasion , and it was at this point that the great Constitutional principle began to decay . Now President Nixon has taken a giant step . Not only has he evaded the spirit of the Constitutional division of powers but he has deliberately ignored its plain meaning and intent . He has decided that he will go to war in Cam  --  bodia because he feels it necessary , no matter what Congress wants or what the people think . He has even implied that such willful disre  --  gard of the people and their elected representatives is an act of noble self-sacrifice , and has hinted that we should admire his cour  --  age in exceeding the limits of his Constitutional powers . The war in Cambodia was not an emergency . There was time enough to present the matter to Congress for a swift de  --  cision . Indeed , unconcealed debate within the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuate the threatened area . But the President did not follow the prece  --  dent of all his postwar predecessors by seeking assurance of congressional sup  --  port , either formally or through meet  --  ings with the leadership . Rather , he made war by fiat . He has thus united in himself the powers that the Consti  --  tution divides and that have remained divided through our history . And this comes from an Administration that proclaims its devotion to " strict con  --  struction . " This is not a technical , legal ques  --  tion . In import , it transcends a chal  --  lenge to the wisdom of the war itself . The President , in effect , has said , " I , and I alone , have decided to go to war in Cambodia . " Where does he get that power ? The Constitution denies it to him . He is not acting under the neces  --  sity , of instant reaction . He has the power only because he asserts it , and because the armies follow . In a world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities unfolded by this reasoning . He can invade Laos and Thailand , where Communists life active . He can enter North Vietnam itself . He can attack China , which is both a sanctuary and a source of supply for the North Vietnamese . Nor is the Soviet Union exempt , since it , too , helps our adversaries in Vietnam . Such an assertion of authority is not among the prerogatives of a democratic leader in a republic of divided powers . Our democracy is not an elective dictator  --  ship . It is a government in which all elected officials have carefully limited powers . Suppose the President said he was going to change the tax laws , be  --  cause the rates were unjust . What an outcry we would hear . Yet how trivial such an act would he , compared to con  --  centrating the power over war and peace in a single office . The life of de  --  mocracy depends on a common accept  --  ance , by people and government , of the limits of power . What if , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground of national need ? Would it he easy to revolt against an armed force of three and a quarter million men if the ) remained obedient to their Com  --  mander-in-ChieP The possibility now seems absurd . But it illumi  --  nates the fact neither guns nor treasuries to enforce their will . Now one of the most basic of these liberating assump  --  tions has been swept away . It most be restored , The first duty of resistance lies with the legislative branch . For years , its members have been abdicating their re  --  sponsibility , watching almost without protest while their authority was eroded and their mandates were evaded , They have allowed their power to be usurped . Now they are scorned and ignored , be  --  cause the President is confident that the have neither the courage nor the will to challenge his action  --  that each , looking to his own interest , will allow the common cause to decay . If this is a true judgment and the President 's act is not repudiated , then they will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Congress is the peo  --  ple 's guardian . The authors of the Fed  --  eralist Papers reassured the doubtful that " in the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared , the Chief Mag  --  istrate of the United States would ... be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body . What more could he desired by an enlightened and reason  --  able people ? " What more indeed ? The other possibility is the Supreme Court . In 1952 , President Truman seized thr steel mills , because , he claimed , a steel strike was endanger  --  ing the war effort in Korea . The Su  --  preme Court decided that he had no such power and ordered him to return the mills , The Court 's opinion con  --  cluded , " The Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the Congress alone in both good and had times . It would do no good to recall the historical events , the fears of power and the hopes for freedom that lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our holding that this seizure order can not stand . " How much inure does this invasion transgress those same hopes and fears . There are many ways to bring the issue to the Supreme Court . The Sen  --  ate itself might instruct its leaders to bring an action to restrain the President or the Secretary of Defense from or  --  dering further combat in Cambodia . This would be an unprecedented re  --  sponse to an unprecedented act . How  --  ever , the issue is Constitutional , and is thus within the jurisdiction of the fed  --  eral courts . And surely no individual or institution has greater standing to bring such an action than a branch of the very body whose powers have been taken away . Another route lies through the re-cent Massachusetts statute that makes it unlawful to require any resident of that state to serve out  --  side the United States in an unde  --  clared war . The Attorney General of Massachusetts has been instructed by the lave to bring an action in the Su  --  preme Court in order to prevent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of the bill was a symbolic action . In the case of the Cambodian invasion , the law could he a vehicle for resolving a momentous issue . Would the Court decide . No one can be sure . But it alone can decide , and that is its responsibility . Discussing the Supreme Court , Hamilton wrote that it must have the power to invalidate all acts by the other branches of govern  --  ment which are contrary to the Con  --  stitution . " To deny this , " he said , " would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal ; that the servant is above his master ; that the representatives of the people are supe  --  rior to the people themselves ; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not author  --  ize but what they forbid . " The President has now declared himself superior to the people , to the legislature , and to the laws . We have lasted as a functioning democracy for almost two hundred years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilant regard for the principle that no one man or institution shall impose an unrestrained will on the decisions that shape the nation . If the American peo  --  ple now let this principle he eroded. , while the capacity for resistance still re  --  mains , then we will deserve our fate , For we will have lost the ultimate protection of liberty , stronger than THE NEW YORKER 33 governments , more enduring than constitutions  --  the will of a people to he free . ? 1-AST Wednesday , near the end of a day during which the student uprising against the invasion of Cam  --  bodia had spread , in one form or anoth  --  er , to all of New York 's forty-two col  --  leges and universities , Mayor Lindsay left Gracie Mansion For the Hotel Plaza , where he was to speak before the American Society of Magazine Editors . The Mayor , who had inter  --  rupted his schedule twice that day to address anti-war rallies  --  one at New York University Law School and the other , organized by city employees , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limousine , he stretched out his long legs , resting his feet against the back of the front scat , and talked about the events at Kent State Uni  --  versity . " The shooting down of these four young boys and girls , in main  --  stream America  --  this has had an im  --  pact that has sunk deeper than any  --  thing else , " he said . " The same thing has happened on campuses before , but nobody paid too much attention to it , because the students who were killed were black . Before this , it has been difficult to get across to people the message about what is happening in the country . " The red blinker on the dashboard flashed on and off as the limousine turned a corner , and the Mayor con  --  tinued , " Our job is to hold the city together , to run a rational government , and to build housing , schools , and health clinics in the process . I have to translate to people in these terms the meaning of the Indo-China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it is terribly pronounced , because I have to run a city . I do believe that the Vietnam war was from the be  --  ginning a futile and immoral action from every point of view . And every time we escalate that war it makes it more difficult to keep the city stable . " When the Mayor arrived at the Baroque Room of the Plaza , the tele  --  vision men turned on their lights , and the magazine editors applauded . In his speech , he described the bitterness on every hand since the extension of the war , and he said , " These sights , sounds , and feelings are the result of national policies that have spawned a polariza  --  tion and hostility sn fundamental that , for the first time in a century , we are not sure there is a future for America . " He continued , " lVe must stop driv  --  ing the disaffected to despair and vier knee by prolonging and extending the agony of an immoral and degrading war . There is a whole new generation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders the reality behind the dry lan  --  guage of the military bureaucrat . Es  --  calation : that means more dead human beings . Pacification : that means more uprooted families . Bombing : that means more man-made deserts God never dreamed of . After half a decade , the disquieting awareness of what the war really means , of how profoundly unworthy it is of this country , still and again stirs protest and dissent The response to pleas to end this debasement of America 's claim of peace and liberty has been a decision to wage a wider war  --  it is said , temporarily .... The violence that started long ago in some obscure Vietnamese village , reinforced and magnified by years of folly and killing , has done to America what no enemy has done for a hundred years . It has turned our land into a battle  --  field . " Here the Mayor read an Associated Press dispatch reporting that the Gov  --  governor of Kentucky had ordered Na  --  tional Guardsmen to patrol a campus with fixed bayonets and live ammuni  --  tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business around , " he went on . " The same arguments invoked to sanction violence in Indo-China function , with a line impartiality , to rationalize for some students the ethic of domestic violence . When you tell the disaffect  --  ed that riot and bloodshed are not the way , they reply that this nation is fol  --  lowing a similar way in Southeast Asia . When you counsel restraint and peaceful action , their reply is ' If the system spreads violence in the name of peace , we 'll do the same . ' " The Mayor appealed to the peace movement to organize itself politically in order to elect anti-war representatives and senators and encourage Congress to withhold funds for the war , and he catalogued the enormous cost , to New York and other cities , of the war . And he concluded , " But even as the cities can not wait , young Americans sons and fathers and friends  --  who are dy  --  ing in Vietnam and Cambodia can wait even less . And that is what it is really all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we do not want  --  what no one should want -- is hatred and bitterness , bombs and burning . Our hold on the future is very frail ; we can not sustain it by war or with the rhetoric and the weapons of angry division . That future  --  all that we are and all that we can he  --  dies a little hit each day the war goes on , 211 d it dies whenever we succumb to the easy conclusion that the con 34 MAY 1 ( pt 1970 testants there or here are gooks or devils , bums or pigs . W e must not forget that we all bleed . " N Thursday morning last week , a funeral service for Jeffrey Glenn Miller , one of the four students killed by Ohio National Guardsmen at Kent State University , was held in Riv  --  erside Memorial Chapel , at the corner of Seventy-sixth Street and Amsterdam Avenue , and a memorial service and vigil were held simultaneously in the street outside . It was a cool , bright , and breezy day , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled to begin , nearly a thousand mourners mostly young mill and Young women  --  had gathered behind police barricades on either side of the avenue . Other mourners , including several hundred students from Pratt Institute who had walked from Brook  --  lyn , over the Manhattan Bridge , were converging upon the scene , and within the next fifteen minutes the crowd had doubled and had begun to fill Seventy-sixth Street between Amsterdam Ave  --  nue and Broadway . Marshals appointed by the ? Vest Side Peace Committee , a coalition of peace groups and Reform Democratic Clubs in the neighborhood , moved through the throng , urging ev  --  eryone to be orderly and to remain be  --  hind the barricades , but this seemed hardly necessary , for it was obvious that the people who had come to the vigil were not there to create any kind of disturbance . Instead , hushed and sol  --  emn , they stood or sat and , like a si  --  lent , accusing chorus , stared impassive  --  ly through what appeared to be a sea of steel-rimmed spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reporters milling about before the entrance to the chapel . By eleven-thirty , when the last of the family , friends , and official mourn  --  ers of Jeffrey Glenn Miller had entered the chapel , the crowd outside had grown to nearly four thousand . Then a group of Jewish mourners arrived , and set bouquets of pink flowers and candles in glass jars hearing Hebrew inscriptions upon a rectangular table that had been placed in the middle of the intersection of Seventy-sixth Street and Amsterdam Avenue . A young woman from the West Side Peace Committee climbed ? ip on the table- and , using a police bullhorn , asked for volun  --  teer marshals to clear a way for the funeral cortege at the conclusion of the service . She was followed by a Presby  --  terian minister , a rabbi , and a Catholic priest , each of whom read psalms and prayers . At eleven-forty-five , a gray hearse that had been parked in front of a luncheonette just south of the chapel entrance was driven a few 4ards for  --  ward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , several young men had draped a large blue banner over a police barricade , which showed a white dove of peace carrying the peace symbol above a field of white stars . Nearby , an  --  other 3 caing man was holding up a photograph 44 Robert Kennedy , and still another joking man held up a photo  --  graph of one of the dead students at Kent State with the word " AVENGE ! ' written across it in red letters . At ten minutes to twelve , a pair of loudspeakers that had been set up on top of the marquee above the chapel en  --  trance were turned on , so that the crowd could hear the funeral service inside , and for the next few minutes all eyes were riveted on the loudspeakers , which carried the voice of Senator Charles E. Goodell , barely audible above the racket of a red-and-white helicopter circling overhead . Senator Goodell was preceded by Dr. Benjamin Spode and followed by Rabbi Harold Saperstein , who , on behalf of the New York Board of Rabbis , offered con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragic death of Jeffrey Glenn Miller . The crowd , straining to hear his words , loudly shushed a police captain who was giving orders to a group of patrolmen carrying nightsticks and riot helmets . At noon , a nearby Civil Defense siren gave a wail as Rabbi Julius Goldberg said , " For God 's sake , in the name of humanity. , give peace a chance . " Then the Kaddish for the dead was intoned over the loudspeakers , the doors of the chapel were opened , and the engines of the gray hearse and a Hack limousine that had been parked hehind it were started up . A few min  --  utes later , a cordon of policemen moved some photographers and television cam  --  eramen hack from the entrance , and a plain wooden casket was carried out of the chapel by pallbearers wearing black yarmulkes , and placed in the hearse . The appearance of the casket was ac  --  knowledged spontaneously by thou  --  sands of hands raised in the V-for-peace sign . Behind it walked the parents , a grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the side  --  walk , everyone in the crowd continued to hold his hand aloft in the peace sign , and there was almost complete silence . Then , with the marshals clearing a way through the throng , the hearse started slowly up the avenue , followed by two rabbis on foot , by the limousine and two other cars , and , finally , by the crowd , which fell in behind . A majority of the people in the procession were dressed in the manner in which the new gene-ration has chosen to differentiate itself sarto  --  rially from its elders , which is to say that for the most part they wore bluejeans , Army field jackets , leather jackets , mackinaws , ponchos , and floppy hats . But there were also young matrons in dresses wheeling infants in strollers , a few elderly people , a dozen or an white-coated interns from Mount Sinai Hos  --  pital and the New Jersel College of Dentistry , and some boys from Trinity School , wearing blue blazers with the school 's emblem on the breast pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they mined left and started toward Broad  --  way , on their way to a rally at Colum  --  bia University . At that point , the gray hearse- and the limousine picked tip speed , and , with the sun glinting on their polished rooftops , sped alone tip the avenue and out of the city . ? PERHAPS the most astonishing thing about last week --  -- surely the most critical week this nation has en  --  dured in more than a century  --  is that its agonies and bitterness could yield , just a little and at the end , to a stub  --  born hope . Only the very young are capable of such a quick and deep swing of emotions , hot the week belonged to the young ; they provided its victims , its rage and energy , most of its history , and all of its sense of a future re  --  opened . It is almost insufferable , of course , to talk about " the young " just now , for if the week had any lesson for us , it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  standing them too quickly in the past . All too often , mere approval of their social and political concern has , in the jargon , co-opted their causes and dead  --  ened them ; mere disapproval of their violence has tempted people to ignore the sources of such passion . May he that THE NEW YORKER kind of patronizing has ended now . The young , in the week of Kent State , asked more insastrd on more  --  and in so doing restored breath to a country that had seemed in many ways close to extinction . The insistence came in vari  --  ous forms , some of them violent . There were strikes , fire bombings , and street fights ; there were prayers and marches and assemblages . All , perhaps , were in  --  evitable , and were necessary to awaken a sense of remaining alternatives in a people who had lapsed into despairing apathy , exhausted by a meaningless , unending war , silenced by the smiling orthodoxy of an Administration that condoned the most vicious attacks on almost even form of dissent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left save between the flag-wavers and the huilding-trashers , be  --  tween the police and the mob . The young , last week , insisted otherwise , and as we counted their numbers ( the chanting coming up from the street be  --  low , the secretaries wearing armbands , all those intent new faces in the news papers ) and signed their petitions of grievance ( " Wo n't you join us in ... " and the smudgy mimeographed sheet extended shyly ) and listened to their accounts of rallies and plans ( " All the faculty was there ! " from a young man , and a young woman smiling and mur  --  muring " Wow ! " and , in that lovely gesture , flinging back her hair with one hand ) , we experienced , for the first time in many months , a feeling about our country that was something other-than anger . More than four hundred colleges and universities across the country were closed by student strikes or by faculty decision , and many administrators , in  --  cluding such heroic friends as President Kingman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education was a sacrifice inappropriate to the occasion . ' ) , Ve disagree . Last week , there appeared a new national campus , which will be kept open , now and for months to come , at all costs . The sic of its enrollment ( voters , legislators , statesmen 1 is not vet known , but it is clear that most of its curriculum will he in the hands of our college students . Trained to com  --  plexity , accustomed to examining diffi  --  cult and disconnected phenomena and searching them for patterns and connec  --  tions , they have drawn the conclusions that the rest of the American people must now understand if this last oppor  --  tunity is not to he lost . We offer some of these conclusions in pricis : The war in Southeast Asia has brought this coun  --  try to the very edge of political self-de  --  struction . The war has shattered our ? econorm . The war has deepened every social and racial and economic division in our society . The war has destroyed our confidence in ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free  --  doms by which we once identified our  --  selves . The war has made us warlike . The war has so dulled our moral ca  --  pacities as to make some of our soldiers capable of mass murder and some of our civilians capable of applauding or will  --  fully ignoring that murder . The war has caused us to be scorned or feared or detested by other nations . The 1 , var , in its infinite prolongation , has made impossible any realistic consideration of the immediate crises in ecology , in race , in urban decay , in poverty , in edu  --  cation , and in the daily content of life which now await us . The war , in its recent extension and in the manner of that extension , has deepened all these divisions and crises , and has made us suspicious of our leaders and cynical about their ability to lead us and their willingness to hear us . The war must be ended . The war must he ended now . We do n't believe that President Nixon agrees with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . In spite of his dawn journey to the Lincoln Memorial to meet a handful of students , in spite of his protestation at his press confer  --  ence that " everything I stand for is what they want , " we do n't believe that he yet understands or much respects the young . But hope persists now , because last week it became evident that the young had emerged as a new and sig  --  nificant national constituency . Most of the students we have talked to who made the trip to Washington told us that there seemed to be an agreement among those scores of thousands gath  --  ered in the Ellipse on that steamy Sat  --  urday that this would he the last rally ; from now on , they said , they would no longer be willing merely to stand and he counted , like bodies . From now on , they would persuade , they would ' obi ) ) , they would round up votes , they would educate .
