As any TV addict knows , Kojak is a dapper detective who exudes animal charm and a street-wise sixth sense . The man whose investigative exploits led to the series , however , is no cop , and he is no well-tailored charmer . He is Reporter Selwyn Raab , 40 , who looks more like rumpled Peter Falk than Telly Savalas . His tenacious reporting has brought him a dozen awards and the pleasure of seeing two victims of law-enforcement abuses walk out of prison . <P> He hopes to see two more men freed soon . Last week , because of stories by Raab , New Jersey Superior Court Judge Samuel Larner was considering reopening the murder convictions of Boxer Rubin ( " Hurricane " ) Carter and Grocery Clerk John Artis after a 1966 shoot-out in Paterson , N.J.

Raab wrote a book about the case ( Justice in the Back Room ) , and CBS later bought the screen rights , transforming Raab into the fictional Kojak . <P> The reporter resembles the TV cop only in his knowledge of New York 's streets . As a teen-ager on the Lower East Side , where he still lives with his wife and their four-year-old daughter , Raab remembers being " surrounded by the kind of legendary criminals you read about-bookmakers , con artists , Jewish and Italian gangsters . I grew up with guys I later covered . " The son of Polish and Austrian immigrants , Raab boxed in the 60-lb. class for the city parks department ( 17 wins ) and later attended City College . Afterward he worked on Connecticut and New Jersey newspapers before returning to New York . Along the way , he dropped out of sight several times to bum around South America .
