txt It 's Friday night in Big D. Crowds of Christmas shoppers make their way slowly along the packed mall of Northpark shopping center , surround the jewelry counter in Titche 's department store and line up 12 deep at jingling cash registers in Spencer Gifts . At Bobby 's Conglomeration , a sprawling steak and lobster restaurant , laughing young couples in the parking lot sip glasses of wine that have been passed down a line of customers that snakes to the door , up a hallway and into a big bar where drinking , dancing customers have been waiting more than two and half hours for a table in the dining rooms . Such are the sights and sounds of prosperity in Dallas , where it 's hardly evident that the nation 's unemployment rate just hit a 13-year high and the sluggish economy is slipping ever more deeply into a recession . Dallas is one of several pockets of prosperity that the national recession has mostly bypassed or to which its descent has been delayed . For the most part these are places shored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its private-aircraft industry , and Moline , Ill. , with its farm-machinery industry , or places like Rock Springs , Wyo. , where the push to develop resources of oil and coal creates a goldrush tempo . Unusual Oasis But the diverse nature of the Dallas economy and the size of its metropolitan area , with a population of 1.6 million , make Dallas an unusual oasis of prosperity . And its solid economic health contrasts dramatically with the poor health of other major cities . Most spectacular is the availability of jobs  --  solid , well-paying ones on which the local economy thrives . In November , Dallas posted an unemployment rate of 3.4% of the labor force , up from 2.8% in October , compared with a November rate of 6.5% for the nation as a whole , 9.1% in Detroit and 10.3% in San Diego . Even the upturn of unemployment in Dallas in November is attributed to some temporary layoffs , and the rate is expected to drop back in December , according t , Robert Irby , unemployment analyst at the Texas Employment Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jobs by now , " he says . There have been worker layoffs here , but expanding work forces at some plants have tended to offset those that occur . So it was for Virgil Hill , a 55-year-old machinist for Tri-State Machinery Co. , a Kimwood Corp . unit that makes woodworking machines for the hard-pressed home-building industry . Mr. Hill was laid off because of a decline in orders . Time Off for Vacation He had hardly settled clown for a few days ' rest , however , before he was solicited by Gardner-Denver Co. , whose oil-field equipment operations here are straining to find enough workers to run at full capacity . " It is n't hard to find a job in Dallas , " observes Mr. Hill , who put off his new employer until he had taken two weeks vacation . " There 's too much work here . " Home building , one of the sickest of the nation 's major industries , has been only modestly affected here . While 1974 housing starts nationally were running 33.5% behind year-earlier levels in October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 levels . " Dallas has never been overbuilt , and you 've got to admit the Dallas economy is in pretty good shape , " says Frank Crossen , chairman of Centex Corp. , whose Fox &; Jacobs unit , a major builder here , boasts unit sales 20% higher and dollar sales 30% higher than in 1973 . Loan collections , a crucial barometer of consumers ' ability to pay , are excellent , banks here agree . Typical is Texas Bank &; Trust Co. , where Sam Black , senior vice president for consumer lending , says , " We 're in the best shape on collections we 've been in for 15 years . " Nationally , by contrast , the dollar volume of new accounts referred to an average collection agency in October increased 18.5% to $123,956.37 from $104,552.98 a year ago , according to the American Collectors Association . Christmas sales , which may hit a record here , also show that consumers ' ability to pay is strong . Sears , Roebuck &; Co. sales are running 15% ahead of last year 's levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the company through the third quarter . Observes a spokesman for J. C. Penney Co. : " We have indications that sales those last four or five days before Christmas probably will be a little bit above fantastic . " Even sales of such big-ticket items as autos , although down , fare better here than elsewhere . In November , new auto sales in Dallas were 27% below last November 's levels , compared with a national slide of 34% . Dealers attribute the losses here to consumer uncertainty and resistance to high prices . " People have the money in their jeans but they 're just waiting around to see what happens , " says Bob Eagle of Eagle Lincoln Mercury Inc . And dealers say appliance sales are holding up well . A Whirlpool distributor here says that November sales rose 54% from last year and 1974 sales are running 16% ahead of 1973 levels . While Dallas is n't one of those lucky places with one dominant industry that happens to be riding high , this lack of a single mainstay is considered an advantage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single industry that goes sour and pulls us down , " explains a Chamber of Commerce analyst . The biggest single factor behind the stability of the Dallas economy is its job mix . Employment in wholesale and retail trade , a category that does n't fluctuate so much in a changing economy , accounts for 27.5% of Dallas-area employment ; services , 17% ; government , 12.1% ; finance , insurance and real estate , 8.5% . Manufacturing , always a volatile ingredient in a city 's economy , provides only 21% of the jobs . Can-Do Spirit And some of the manufactured products Dallas does make are in high demand these days because of the energy crisis . Oil-field equipment manufacturers " are suddenly experiencing better business than they 've had for 20 years , " says an economist for Texas Power &; Light Co . Dresser Industries Inc. , which is planning a $7 million expansion of its Dallas oil-field equipment pl , , , nts says it will increase its work force to 1,100 from 900 . Dallas also benefits from . t , ; ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s center . Ebby Halliday , a major local R , - altor whoeo , fiscal 1974 sales ran 14.9% ahead of 1973 , says , " This area is n't experiencing the real estate recession of the rest of the country because we 're still experiencing quite a bit of movement in and out , especially in the area of executive and corporate transfers . " A generous dose of Texas gall and poker bluff does n't hurt either , a point subtly articulated by C. Jackson Grayson , dean of the Southern Methodist University business school and chairman of the Cost of Living Council during Phase Two " One intangible factor is Dallas ' ' spirit of optimism , of cando , of willingness to take risks in the face of a lot of gloom around the country . People tend to keep investing despite the economic dip , so this area tends to be one of the last to cut back . " All of this is n't to say , of course , that Dallas is a horn of plenty in which employer and employe alike enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One man with a problem is Harry Boucher , who slumps behind his cluttered desk at Lance Industries Inc. , a maker of pizza-dough rollers where the workday starts at 8 a.m . " It 's nine o'clock , and only half our people are in . It 's the same old story , " he says with a sigh , noting that tardiness and absenteeism are major problems in the tight labor market . " You ca n't lay down the law to them because they 'll quit or you 'll have to fire them , and there are n't that many to replace them with . " At Republic National Bank , where annual turnover has hit 40% , the bank initiated bigger merit raises and improved hospital benefits , started career-advancement sessions and sweetened other fringe benefits to stem the tide . As frustrating as absenteeism and high turnover to employers is a lack of experienced workers . " We 're hiring people who ca n't read a 12-inch ruler , " moans Rex Appleton , industrial-relations manager of Dresser Industries ' rock-bit manufacturing plant . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how well Dallas will elude the ravages of the rapidly declining economy . Most business leaders here are convinced the city will increasingly feel the national economic decline , but considerably less than most cities . " We 're not recessionproof , nobody is , " says Brennan Haney , vice president of business development for the chamber of commerce . " A maximum unemployment rate of 4% is probably as good a guess as anybody can come up with , and even if it get 's that high , we 'll be in better shape than most anybody else .
