A subject of speculation for months . <P> Wall Street 's experiment to woo back small investors with competitive commissions arrived last week-on little cat feet . The Securities and Exchange Commission ordered that , beginning April 1 , brokers who are members of the New York or American Stock Exchange must substitute flexible rates for their old fixed commissions on trades under $2,000 . The idea is to get more firms to vie vigorously for small transactions and to give customers of modest means a saving on trading costs . Yet , reflecting the caution of the ailing securities industry , the effort got off to a sluggish start . Only a few major brokerage firms unveiled cut-rate commission plans-and those were hedged about by so many restrictions as to make them seem an April Fool 's joke . <P> The most aggressive offer came from Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith , the industry giant . It reduced its rates by 16% to 25% below fixed levels on some orders of less than $2,000 . A $100 buy or sell order , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs $4.31 ; a $2,000 transaction that formerly entailed a $39.60 commission can be effected for $32.51 . But for those who avail themselves of these cheaper rates . Merrill Lynch imposes stiff requirements designed to cut its own costs . Stock certificates must be held by the firm to avoid the paper work of transferring ownership ; no credit or margin purchases are offered ; customers must send their cash or stock in advance instead of being granted the usual five-day grace period to pay up . To eliminate the expense of executing many small transactions , Merrill Lynch fills most cut-commission orders in a bunch at the opening of trading the day after the money arrives . Under this arrangement , an overnight rise of only half a point could wipe out whatever saving the customer would realize from the cheaper commissions . <P> Similar restrictions are included in a plan offered by Paine , Webber , Jackson &; Curtis , but the rate reduction is only about 10% on certain trades . On the other hand , Paine , Webber increased by roughly 4.5% its basic commission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors will pay higher commissions , not lower ones . Bache &; Co. offers only a 25% reduction to in-and-out traders who are willing to make at least two transactions-one buy and one sell-in any 35-day period , and the cut applies only to the second trade . Most brokerage houses , while technically unfixing their rates , still charge about the same fees as before on small trades on a take-it-or-leave-it basis . <P> Scant Interest . Not surprisingly , investors round the country have shown scant interest in the new cut-rate packages , which the houses have made little effort to promote . One small shareholder , Ditria Ilario of Manhattan , notes sourly : " You can make more money by putting your cash in the bank . " Brokers are equally unmoved . Says Harvey Bettis , chief of Harris , Upham &; Co. ' s Chicago operation : " There 's a possibility that we will just leave the damn thing alone . "
