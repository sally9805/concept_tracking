THE WATER-METHOD MAN <P> by JOHN IRVING <P> 365 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> In John Irving 's fine first novel , Setting Free the Bears , two Vienna University students plan to reform the world by liberating the animals in Vienna 's Hietzinger Zoo . Now he offers the dislocated odyssey of an Iowa University graduate student who seems to be helplessly bound for self-destruction . <P> Irving 's easily daunted hero is Fred ( " Bogus " ) Trumper , a monumental procrastinator with a talent for bungling . Bogus ' hardscrabble effort to support his wife " Biggie " and infant son Colm by selling football pins and pennants is thwarted by a mob of fans who pick clean his display board . Seeing his existence threatened by " little things-errors of judgment , but never crimes " - Bogus begins identifying with Akthelt , the heroic warrior and lover in Akthelt and Gunnel-an absurd Old Low Norse epic he is translating for his doctoral thesis . And when Akthelt is told " Det henskit of krig er tu overleve " ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trumper thinks : " Which struck me as the object of graduate school-and possibly my marriage . " <P> Owls and Mice . But survival for Bogus is a haphazard undertaking at best . An unsuccessful attempt at infidelity becomes a mad , nude chase across the Iowa countryside that leaves Bogus with bleeding feet , if not a bleeding heart . Homeward bound , he falls off a bicycle in front of a barber shop and sardonically observes : " Several sheeted men raised their shaved skulls above the backs of their barber chairs , watching me writhe on the sidewalk as if they were owls-and me , a club-footed mouse . " <P> Worse yet , Trumper 's sex life is painfully complicated by a medical complaint that might embarrass even Alexander Portnoy . Unable to commit himself to risky surgery , Trumper opts for " the water method " -a sloppy palliative that requires him to drink huge amounts of water before and after intercourse to flush himself out . <P> To flush out his life , however . Bogus flees his family and goes to Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him has died-another illusory hero image . What follows vacillates between brutal reality and hallucination , comedy and pathos . Eventually , Bogus comes to see himself as Moby Dick , " mindful of his scars , his old harpoons and things , " knowing that his very endurance is in itself monumental . <P> Remarkably , John Irving manages to weave the disparate fragmented elements of Trumper 's calamities into a rich , unified tapestry . From the dreck of daily lives , he can make the improbable seem likely and retrieve something of beauty .
