 |p506  Robin Sails Home T HE SEA IS GLASSY CALM . If I lean over the rail I can see my sweat-streaked face in the water . The sails droop and flap in hazy , glary air that hurts my eyes . I 'm barely moving , getting nowhere . But up ahead , over the curve of the world , is my journey 's end . The next shore I stand on will be California 's , which I left nearly five years ago , a schoolboy in a small boat , sailing westward alone . I 've been going westward and westward ever since , leaving California farther and farther astern . Now it 's on my bow , and getting nearer and nearer . So I guess the world is really round . I mean , it 's one thing to know that , and another to experience it . This is my last and longest leg . The Galapagos Islands are not far astern . How far to go ?

Thirty , with miraculous luck , which I never count on , even though I 've had my share of it . No , let 's say forty , or maybe fifty . or it could be sixty . So now I wait , and sweat , and think ahead to life in the United States ( a hard thing to do : I 've been a long time gone ) and back to all the things that have happened ever since I went to sea .... Taking an over-all look at it , my roundthe-world voyage seems to fall into three parts , both geographically and personally . @# @#  |p507  First came the run out through the Pacific and Indian Oceans to Durban in South Africa , in which a very young sailor and a very small boat managed somehow to get halfway around the globe . During the weeks we spent at the bottom of the African continent , the boy I was took a long step into maturity : Patti Ratterree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My boat , Dove , a 24-foot day-sailer modified for cruising , was modified a lot more in South Africa to make her safer and easier to sail on the open sea . The second stage found Dove and me crossing the South Atlantic , both of us better equipped than we 'd ever been for an ocean passage . I had more to live for , and my strengthened boat was more likely to keep me living . But the changes in Dove were n't great enough to match the changes in me . I 'd outgrown her , physically and psychologically . I was sick of the boat , sick of the sea . By the time I reached Surinam in South America , I knew I could n't face another long haul in Dove . I was n't sure I could go on at all . I did manage to keep going to Barbados , in the West Indies . Patti met me there . In that lovely serene island we rested and played . And we worked out plans for me to finish what I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbadian sun . We managed to find a neat little apartment right on the leeward shore of Barbados . The sea off the beach was protected and calm , so I anchored Dove there . I brought Kili and blind Fili ashore ( they 're the kittens given to us in South Africa ) , and we all settled in . Next to being back with Patti , what I wanted most was hot fresh-water showers , fresh food , a home that held still , and the bonedeep pleasure of sleep . I mean real sleep , the restless catnaps I had at sea where I do/ with one ear and half a mind tuned to wake me at every change of sound or motion , I wanted quiet , and sun , and friendly peop And pretty , changing country to make up f memories of a thousand similar seascapes . - Rest Brings Renewed Resolve We toured around by motorbike ( below riding for miles between stands of eight foot-high sugar cane and along the rock headlands and shell-sand beaches of island 's windward side , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked . on a grassy hill , where-the trees had b - shaped and bent by trade winds . Someti - we took picnics there , and we 'd eat and around feeling good . Often we took the bus into Bridgetown , the  |p509  capital , and went shopping , looking for delicious things to take home and cook . We went diving , too , in the dead-clear water offshore , and found out that Barbados is as beautiful under water as above it . After we 'd gotten well settled , my mother came from California to visit us for a few days , which was great . I had n't seen her for three years , and she had never met Patti . Once my raw edges were smoothed out by rest and happy times , I became convinced that I could carry on if I could get the right boat . She should be more than 30 feet long , so that she could weather almost any storm and would have full headroom below . She should be less than 40 feet , because the sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulky for a single-hander to manage easily . She should be made of ? fiberglass , which requires less maintenance than wood , and her power must be diesel , for reliability , before continuing in a rural road lined th sugar cane that ripin the trade winds . economy , and safety : Diesel fuel is far less explosive than gasoline . To find this dream boat , we 'd have to leave Barbados . Florida , with its hundreds of marinas , would be the place to start looking . We buttoned up Dove , left our gear aboard , took the cats , and flew northwest . It took us a long time to find what we wanted , at a price we could pay . We had some money saved up , and we knew about how much little Dove would bring . Beyond that , we 'd have to work out loans or advances , and find a manufacturer interested enough in my trip to sell me a boat at a price I could afford . The advances came from the Geographic , as partial payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Allied Boat Company , Inc. , of Catskill , New York , which also manufactured a 33-foot sloop that we liked better than any boat we 'd seen . She had just about all the features we wanted , @#  |p510  but I added a few pieces of extra equipment to help me single-hand her . One was a selfsteering rig . Another was roller-furling gear for my two headsails , which would allow me to roll them up like window shades , or let them out as much as the wind permitted , all without leaving the cockpit . For safety 's sake , I ordered a depth-sounder to measure water depth near shore , and installed a radiotelephone . And I asked that a kerosene stove be put in . Kerosene is much less inflammable than alcohol , the usual stove fuel , and it 's easier to get in remote places . When Allied had finished , our new boat was fully equipped and ready to sail . She was shipped overland to Florida . We launched her , christened her The Return of Dove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBIN LEE GRAHAM ( ABOVE ) AND PATRICIA GRAHAM U N.G.S.  |p511  She was beautiful , and she lived up to all . ur dreams . When we took her out to try her , he seemed tremendous compared to little Dove . But she sailed wonderfully in light air and strong winds , and she gave me a fine feeling of security . She felt strong and comfortable under conditions in which little Dove would have been taking a beating and giving me one . She could make six knots in a good ' freeze that would have pushed Dove at four and a half . That would mean a lot on the long hauls ahead . Also , to windward the new boat could keep sailing in winds as high as forty knots . Little Dove had to be hove to when the winds got over twenty in the open sea . Patti and I decided to sail together through the Bahamas to the Virgin Islands and base there for a while . I 'd fly to Barbados and bring Dove back ; we 'd have a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worked there , getting ready for the next leg of my trip , the thousand-mile run to Panama . Also , this would save sailing The Return of Dove ( we were calling her big Dove by now , or just Dove ) to Barbados ( map , page 506 ) . That long beat to windward would be really a pain . Our trip from Florida to the Virgins was n't part of my circumnavigation of the earth , so I wo n't dwell on it . We visited North Cat Cay and North Bimini , crossed the Bahama banks to Nassau , and sailed on to Eleuthera on the edge of the Atlantic deep . On the long sail to St. Thomas we hit 60-knot squalls that proved big Dove a great boat and Patti a real sailor . She never wavered until the stormy day 511  |p512  when I suggested canned oysters for lunch . We got into St. Thomas on May 26 , 1969 , after a rough , miserable passage . We cleared customs , found ourselves a mooring , and began to fix what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made a lot of new friends . The cats had a ball running around on the docks ( even Fili , the blind one , though we could n't understand how she managed it ) . After eleven days I flew to Barbados to sail little Dove back . She felt like a toy after the big boat . It was comforting to know that I 'd be near islands all the way to St. Thomas . That would make - navigation easy , too . I had n't bothered to bring my sextant and book of tables . No need to shoot the sun when you can see the land . , I only had about 500 miles to go , and I did n't stop once . The winds were good , right where I wanted them . I left Martinique to port , then got in the lee of the Leewards . When I passed downwind of Dominica , it smelled like one big flower . The only trouble with this trip was that , being so close to land , I had to stay awake all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind died . I fell asleep at the tiller and woke up only a mile off the island 's reefs . Little Dove gets a Beauty Treatment Beyond Nevis and St. Kitts , I had an 80-mile run to the Virgins across open sea . I came into St. Thomas toward dusk on June 11 , just as the lights were going on ashore . I pulled up alongside big Dove and surprised Patti . She had n't expected me until morning . For four weeks we worked on little Dove , restoring all her brightwork and painting her hull . When we were done , she looked prettier than she ever had . We put a " For Sale " sign on her , and it kind of hurt . With that job finished , we took off and sailed around the Virgins in big Dove , exploring and diving for fun and food . I 've always taken time to have a good look at each new region along my route , which is why my  |p515  journey has stretched across almost five years . We found nice inlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish and lobsters . We were having a fine time , but we were n't getting much work done . So we sailed big Dove to Peter Island , anchored her bow and stern , ran a line from the masthead to a big rock ashore , and winched her over . That way we were able to scrub and paint along the waterline . After that we went back to St. Thomas Harbor and tackled the smaller chores . Then along came a buyer for little Dove . By the time we got her sold , we were well into August and the hurricane season . I 'd planned to leave alone for Panama before the season began . But now it seemed wiser to wait . In three more months it would be over . So we iced up , and took on water , and got food aboard , and headed out to see more of the Virgin Islands . In mid-August , while poking around in Gorda Sound , we saw a little resort being built on the shore of Virgin Gorda . We rowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Basil Symonette , offered us a job . He needed people to .  |p516  help finish the place ? he called it The Bitter End . We enjoyed a last lazy holiday , then took the job ( below ) . I put up walls , installed windows , worked on a refrigerator , made shelves , and rebuilt a dinghy . Patti helped with painting and put in a garden . When we finished at The Bitter End , we 'd learned enough to build a place of our own , when the time comes . We worked for two months ; then we sailed away . The hurricane danger was just about past , and it was time to move on . I had the boat hauled , and painted her bottom . While she was on the ways , I decided to install refrigeration . It took me a week , and I did most of the work myself . I ended up with a fair-sized deep freeze that ran off the engine and would keep things frozen if I ran it for just one hour a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 21 , Patti left . on the S.S. Lurline for Panama . We planned to meet in Porvenir , one of the Panamanian San Blas Islands , 960 miles from St. Thomas . I got under way that noon with the sails set and Gandalf doing the steering . Gandalf is what we call the new self-steerer ; it 's the name of the wizard in J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Hobbit , and seemed appropriate , because the selfsteerer is kind of a wizard itself . It steers the boat by the action of the wind on a vane . I made a cool drink with the first ice produced by my new freezer . Then I got out my tape recorder . Being alone , I felt like talking : " It 's good to get moving . I 'm doing very well , making better than six knots on a broad reach . A little while ago it rained , and I got a really nice bath . " Next day , November 22 , the wind began to blow out of the southwest , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating right into it , in the rain , with the genoa reefed to the size of a dinghy bottom . Then Gandalf broke his leg ? that is , the wooden oarlike blade that sticks into the water . I had only one spare . I desperately 516 hate to steer , so I made a note to be sure to order new spares in Panama . I did n't relish , the idea of having to steer by hand for a month or two in the Pacific . By the twenty-fifth the wind got back where it belonged ; that is , out of the east Things began to look up . By radio I talked to Patti aboard the Lurline , which was great And I was making good speed on half-reefed I jib and staysail , set wing and wing . In the evening a tern came in to rest on the furled : . mainsail ( page 521 ) . On the twenty-sixth I saw four ships . One passed so close to me during the night that : t turned its searchlight on to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ships are around . 4  |p517  On my seventh day out , the twenty-eighth , the wind dropped and I turned on the engine . It was really neat to be able to keep right on going , wind or no wind . I had fuel enough in my tanks to run about 300 miles . I figured I 'd see land early the next day ? some of the San Blas Islands . But I waited and waited and waited and then , in the afternoon , I saw trees in the distance . I got into Porvenir at five o'clock , after eight days and five hours of sailing . I 'd gone 1,099 nautical miles by my taffrail log , which records the distance I go through the water . The straightline distance was 139 miles shorter , but you ca n't always sail in a straight line . The charts for these islands are n't too accurate , and the light was fading . I came in slowly and found a safe place to anchor . Then I looked around to see if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person in a harbor from a boat at anchor ? but Porvenir is a very small cay . It has an airstrip on it , and airplanes land at one end of the island and stop at the other . Just . I did n't see Patti . I got in the dinghy and rowed in with my papers to clear with customs and see if the tiny hotel there had a reservation for her . Out of the hotel came Patti , flying . Except for the hotel and a few government buildings and a lot of palm trees , there is n't much on Porvenir . Most of the Cunas ? the local Indians ? live on other islands . But the land and water are pretty and the people are  |p518  clean and pleasant . They come to Porvenir to sell things to the tourists who fly out from mainland Panama to see them . Patti and I would explore the Panama islands and canal together , living on and off the boat and going on short sailing trips , as we had in the Virgins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama ; from there I 'd set out alone on the next leg of my voyage . First we visited an island plantation that was n't more than half a mile long but had hundreds of coconut palms , three or four thatched shacks , one man , and a whole bunch of women to harvest the crop . The whole San Blas economy depends on coconuts . After a few days , we went on to Tigre Island , just off the mainland , where we saw several of the albino Indians for which these islands are famous . There were so many when the Spaniards came that they thought they 'd discovered a tribe of whites . We made other stops , one at Pidertupo , where an American couple , Tom and Joan Moody , had built a pretty little resort in native style , another at a ramshackle old hotel full of character and creaking planks , built out over the harbor at Pico Feo . Then we powered into Cristobal in the Canal Zone . ' Sandy Beach No Place for a Luau It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so too . How she got off the boat we do n't know , but she did . She vanished on December 22 . We searched everywhere , even went around showing people her picture . Then , two days later , she showed up again right in the yacht club entrance ? with a raffish-looking tomcat . Christmas came along , and some Americans we 'd met invited us to spend it with them . It was nice to see Christmas celebrated with a Christmas tree . We were stuck in Cristobal , waiting for .  |p522  spare parts for Gandalf the self-steerer and some other gear we needed . So we decided to have a luau . That 's a Hawaiian cookout with a roast pig as the main attraction . We did n't find a pig right away , but we came across a real character ? a big black man , all dressed in homemade tin armor . At a distance he looked like Balboa himself . He told us there were no pigs around there . Later we managed to buy a pig and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did n't know how long to cook the pig , and when we took him out his head fell off . He was overdone . Also , we learned , you should never make an umu in the sand . You ca n't keep the sand off the pig . We had about 35 guests at our luau . Even though they had to eat overdone sandy pork , everybody had a good time . There was n't any sand in the beer . Dove Takes On a Five-man Crew By mid-January our spare parts had arrived and the boat was ready to go . The Panama Canal Company pilot came aboard at 8 a.m. on January 17 , and we started through Gatun Locks with him and four linesmen aboard . You do n't just sail your own boat through the canal ( page 524 ) . It 's a tricky business because the water in the locks gets really turbulent as the level changes . The canal company handles the transit . Sailboats can get to rolling and bang their masts and spreaders against the wall if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the first lock with a tug between us and the wall . In the others we managed by getting lines ashore on both sides to hold us clear . We got to Balboa , at the Pacific end of the canal , without any damage . It was getting to be time for me to set out again alone , bound now for the Galapagos Islands . Patti and I spent a week by ourselves at Taboga Island , a few miles offshore . We came back on the twenty-ninth , tied up to the fuel dock , fueled up , and went ashore to do laundry . In the morning some friends came and picked up Patti and her gear . She would catch up with me at my next stop , traveling by ship and plane . At 7:30 on the morning @# of Friday , January 30 , I headed out to I powered free of land , then hoisted and ran all day before an east-nort breeze , making about six knots .

If I 'd still in little Dove , I do n't think I could have myself leave at all . " I made 153 miles from noon yesterday noon today . Great going ! " The good winds held through February then quit . The next morning they were ri on my nose . I beat to windward for two days going through a lot of water , but not m much mileage toward my destination . On the sixth day , February 5 , the sun c up beautifully and the seas were calm . powered directly toward San Cristobal in Galapagos , still 250 miles away .

" And later : " I got up close to San Cristobal as day ended , but could n't find any shelter . I kept going , dark or no dark . I got into the main harbor , Wreck Bay , by depth-sounded readings . Kind of nerve-racking ! It was 11:30 before I dropped anchor . It seemed to me a very lonely place . I felt better about it when an Ecuadorian Navy man ( the Galapagos belong to Ecuador ) took the trouble to row out to suggest a better anchorage . " I did n't go ashore right away . There were repairs to be done . But after a couple of days I rowed in , bought some buns and limes and got 21/ , gallons of water , and came back . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth I got a cable saying that she was flving out from Guayaquil the next day . The Galapagos airport is on Baltra Island , almost 50 miles from where I was , so I ran to the shore , rowed to the boat , put Gandalf together , got my safety harness on , pulled the dinghy aboard , took up my anchor and 150 feet of chain , and got underway just at dark . I powered most of the night . I got into Baltra , anchored , and walked up a the airport . The plane came in . No Patti . I walked back to the beach . Three days later the plane came again , and this time it brought Patti . It turned out that she 'd been bumped off the earlier flight . With her were her father and stepmother , Allan and Ann Ratterree . It was just great . Sea Lions Act Like Playful Pups Once again I took time off for local cruising and exploring before traveling on alone . The four of us went first to Plaza Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lichens and red-leafed plants ? also and iguanas and sea lions . We went diving with the sea lions , and they played just like dogs ( pages 528-9 ) . They 'd pick up things in their mouths and drop them again , and come and dart and roll around and look at us . We could touch them , - but not hold them . On shore the bulls would chase us if we got too close to their harems . The land iguanas were n't so playful . They stood around looking like small dinosaurs , and we fed them banana peels and cactus flowers . We decided to leave Dove in Academy Bay , ' n Santa Cruz Island , and visit nearby islands on a local boat , the Vagabond . We took Kili @# and Fili with us , and on the . day we left Fili had her kittens . Two died . We named the other two Piglet and Pooh . On the Vagabond , I did n't have to sail , so I was free to get a good look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , partly because it 's the last inhabited place you can put in to on the offshore route from the Canal Zone to California , and partly because there 's no place like it in the world. * One of our first stops was Cormorant Point on Santa ' Maria Island ( map , next page ) . There's-a little bay there , and back of it are lots of flamingos , pompous and clownish in their slow strutting , buc graceful in flight . Later , on Espanola Island , we saw mockingbirds so thirsty they 'd climb into your hands to get water if you held some in your palm . There were masked boobies , with furry , fluffy young ones , tame as kittens , and marine iguanas , beautifully colored in reds and greens for the mating season . A blowhole near the 525  |p527  shore spouted sea foam 30 feet into the air , spraying the seals and iguanas gathered around it . Back aboard Dove , we sailed to San Salvador Island , where we hunted pig and goat in the hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delicious ! At night , in Buccaneer Cove , seals rushed at Dove through the dark water , looking like torpedoes wrapped in phosphorescence . We took Dove back to Baltra , the airport island , on March 3 . Al and Ann Ratterree flew home , after 11 fine days with us . Patti and I sailed over to Santa Cruz Island and found a beautiful little tidal pool to swim in . There was a baby fur seal in it , so tame that he came up to sniff us and bite our hands . We 'd shot a parrotfish for the cats , and tried to feed ' it to the seal , but he thought it was something to play with . Dove needed new bottom paint . Back near Academy Bay we arranged to tie up in a shallow-water dock where the boat would be high and dry at low tide . I spent March 5 , my twenty-first birthday , scraping and repainting , and a pufferfish swam up in the ankledeep water and bit me on the toe ? not the pleasantest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice cake . It looked queer because the boat was tilted over when she baked it , but it tasted good . She gave me a present , too ? a plastic model kit of Sir Francis Drake 's Golden Hind . Before leaving Academy Bay , we laid in fresh vegetables and fruit . I added a couple of goats to our meat supply . With our boat full of good fresh food we headed for Fernandina , the westernmost of the main group of islands . Stitch in Time Helps a Pelican Dine Fernandina has a raw , rough look to it . It 's mostly lava , with a fringe of mangroves near the water . Small fiords cut into it . Inland , there 's a .4,902-foot volcano with clouds around it . We found penguins and iguanas and flightless cormorants along the shore . Later , when we threw garbage over the side , a bunch of pelicans flew in to eat it ; and here began one of the oddest animal experiences we 've ever had . Among the pelicans was one with a damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated at the tip . The skin pouch between them was torn . Everything he picked up just dropped right out again . We lured him close , and I jumped overboard and grabbed him . With Patti 's help I wrestled him aboard . We got some equipment from the first-aid kit and began sewing up the poor guy 's mouth . It took about an hour . To finish the job , we drilled through the ends of his lower bill bones and put in stainless steel wire to hold them together . Then we let him go ( pages 530-31 ) . Next day the pelican was back with the others . He could outdo all the rest in catching the scraps we threw . It was really great . Our time together was running out . I felt I had to get moving again . On March 16 we began working our way back by easy stages to San Salvador , where Patti would be able to catch the interisland steamer Lina-A ,  |p530  bound for Baltra , from which she 'd fly to Guayaquil and board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvador , we reserved a berth for Patti , then filled my water tanks . I checked my fuel supply : 75 gallons , including ferry cans on deck . I laid in provisions from the Lina-A : 10 pounds of flour , 20 of potatoes , 10 of onions , 2 of cheese . Later we got Patti 's gear into the dinghy , and I rowed her to the Lina-A after dark . I got under way a little after 2 a.m. and sailed for five straight hours on a favoring wind , almost a record in these windless parts . I began to talk into the tape recorder : " It 's really lonely . There 's a great big emptiness inside me . It 's pretty hard to fight back the tears . I keep telling myself I 'm on my V .1-i to Los Angeles . Far away as it is , it 's my next port . This is the last trip , I say , and it will seem to go much faster .

I had sort of a breakdown he end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I found that the line holding the boom out knotted too tightly to be untied . I was working with tshlight . I got so mad that I went below and threw the alight against the bulkhead and broke it . I grabbed  |p533  a diving knife and went back to cut the jammed line , and I almost slashed the sail up too . I stopped short of that , thank heavens . I have no spare sails . " When the wind was light and variable , the sails would flap and bang horribly as the boat rolled in the little swells . It drove me crazy , and it was hard on the sail seams . But anything was better than not moving at all . So I kept on trying to sail . On April 3 , my eleventh day at sea , I made 34 miles noon to noon . The taffrail log hung almost straight down . I awoke at 5:30 a.m. on the fourth , and the sea was n't glassy any more . I could n't believe it . There were little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the main , and started going maybe five , six knots . The sky was full of trade-wind clouds , little puffy white ones . The wind held , and it blew from the northeast . That had to mean that I was out of the miserable doldrums at last . Noon to noon : 149 miles . Fantastic ! So by the end of my second week at sea things were beginning to look up . I was really moving . I caught my first fish , a bonito ( the cats loved it ) . And I ran off one chart and onto the next . It was nice not to look at the Galapagos and doldrums belt any more , and to see the U. S. West Coast . Even on paper . I began to feel more cheerful : " April 7 ; fifteenth day . I made 155 miles today . I tried cooking a piece of goat . Part of @#  |p534  it was green , and smelled , but I just cut off the green meat and cooked the rest . I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out my roast dinner . " Three days later the wind went around to the north . That meant I was sailing to windward , but I kept making good progress . The boat was doing fine , pitching a lot but not pounding . And the rail was never under . Wet , but not buried . It was uncomfortable , though . I had to get up several times at night to see that everything was all right . Little Shipmate Disappears I approached Clarion Island , a speck of Mexican rock some 348 miles offshore , on April 12 . I saw it at 4:15 in the afternoon . I thought I 'd have an anxious night , because I could n't sail near an island I could n't see . But at midnight the moon set right behind the island , 10 miles away . I kept going . Next day Fili was gone . She just was n't on board anywhere . I felt so sick about it that I had no words to tape . She 'd come nearly halfway around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another couple of weeks , she 'd have been safe ashore . The wind kept on blowing , right from where I wanted to go , which was northwest . Since a sailboat ca n't sail up the wind , but only about 45 degrees off it , I decided to go north for 400 miles and hit Baja California The idea of getting nearer to some shore ? any shore ? was pretty appealing . I did n't mention it much in my taping , but this whole trip was very lonely . I felt as though something were missing from my life Even the boat felt incomplete . What was missing was Patti . But it would n't be much longer now . Only 900 more miles to go . On April 15 I could hear a lot of American ships on the radio . I called them , but the . could n't hear me . I was feeling discouraged " Piglet peed on my pillow , " I taped . " Time is dragging . I 'm not making good progress . though I 'm beating hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . So far I had n't had any proof that it was working , since no one had ever answered me . What a relief ! It was the fishing vessel Jinita out of San Diego . The skipper said he 'd try to relay a message to Patti 's father in Long Beach . That would really be great . because I was n't where anybody thought I would be , least of all me . I had n't planned to head in toward Baja California . Now at least people would know my position . I was feeling good about this until I went to start up my engine next day , and it would n't start . No engine , no generator ; no generator. no batteries ; no batteries , no radio . Then I 539 noticed that I 'd forgotten , to open the engine exhaust pipe . I guess I was a , little excited . Jinita called back to say she had n't been able to reach Al Ratterree , but while we talked , a bigger boat , the Olympia , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al right away and gave him my message . Now it was a matter of pushing ahead as best I could and keeping my morale up . On the twenty-fifth day I taped : " I 've been working on my model and puttering around with little things . I find a lot to ( io without doing much . The weather is gorgeous . It 's so calm and sunny I got up nerve to take a bath . I really needed it . The water was icy , but I got clean . I washed my hair and felt about 10 pounds lighter . " At 5:45 a.m. on the twenty-sixth day , April 18 , I saw land ? Cape San Lazaro , in Baja California . I came about and headed due west , right out to sea . That course would n't take me any closer to L.A. , but it might get me out to where I could find a decent wind . I made good speed on reefed main and genoa . I put my thoughts on tape again : " It 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get really warm is at night , under my quilt . All the cats come and sleep with me these days . No wonder ; it gets below 60 , and we 're all used to equatorial weather . But it 's hard to sleep when itchy little whiskers are tickling your face . " I 've got just under 600 miles to go , and I 'm communicating with home . But these Lils Home 539 ceaseless head winds are beginning to get me . I feel irritable , and so does Kili . There 's nothing for him to do ? no bugs to chase , no green leaves* to chew on . The kittens do n't mind ; they keep eating my ship model . They love the threads , the little spools , everything . " Later I added : " Kili seems to be going crazy . He stares at the wall , then his hair goes up and he gets terrified . If I make a quick motion it really wipes him out . I wear a fishing knife in a leather sheath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little tapping and I look down and there 's Kili batting at my sheath . Sometimes he sits down and cries as loud as he can . I do n't blame him . There were times when I felt like doing that myself . " I had been one month at sea by the 23rd , and conditions were awful . Head winds still plagued me , and they were so strong I could n't head up much . I figured I 'd gone far enough out to sea , so I turned back toward the coast . There was almost a full gale blowing . Two days later my jib halyard broke , and I had to jury-rig another one . But that afternoon ? about 5 o'clock ? the wind shifted a little , and I was able to head toward Los Angeles , which was northeast of me by then . I was getting there , and none too soon . The increasing cold was hard to take . By the morning of April 27 , the thirty-fifth day , I was 250 miles in a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles port system I was bound for . And I could sail that direct line if the wind I had would hold . 544 National Geographic , October 1970  |p544  through the Los Angeles breakwaters . What . lay beyond those waterfront lights was a world I 'd hardly known and half forgotten . I 'd left that world 1,739 days before , heading out into the open ocean with little money , few supplies , and no , firm plans except to keep going . I 'd wandered westward , stopping to see new places and people , working when I could , living as best I could off the lands and seas I visited . I 'd traveled 30,600 nautical miles , and now my ' story was coming to an end ; I was back where I started . At 6 o'clock I heard Al Ratterree on the radio , saying he saw me . Next thing I knew he was pulling alongside me with Patti aboard , and our relatives , and half a dozen friends . They could n't come aboard ? no one could until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melon , some cottage cheese , a sweet roll , and a bottle of " instant tolerance " ? in this case , champagne ( page 542 ) . They headed back , to wait for me at the dock . I followed , passing the sailboats of the annual Ensenada Race coming out . Some of the racers waved and hollered , " Welcome home , Robin . " I guess a lot of boat radios were monitoring my calls that morning . When I did get to the dock , I was just as glad that customs law kept everyone off . There were dozens of newsmen there , enough to sink Dove ( preceding pages ) . Besides , she was a mess inside . They had a lot of questions , and I did n't have many answers . All my feelings about the ending of my journey , finishing this last leg , getting home safe all of them just added up to one big sigh of relief . I found , almost to my surprise , that I remembered the look and feel of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions were familiar . I 'd heard them across the world : " What made you do it ? " I 'm not sure . There were several little reasons ( such as liking to cruise and not liking school ) , but no big one . I think fate started me , and kept me going , and brought me home I do n't know how else to explain it . " Would you do it again ? " Well , of course not . Why do it again whet : you 've done it once ? " What are you going to do now ? " I do n't know c Get some more schooling , probably . Bu : Patti and I know this much : Before too lone we 'll build a little place for ourselves a long way from and city . Not to hide from the civilized world but to enjoy the natural one . We 've been closer to nature than most young people , and we love it . Whatever we might do , wherever we might go , I had memories enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like being nearly run down at night by a ship at sea But there were others less frightening and more valuable : memories of cheerful , goodhearted people , living in simple societies where a man 's kindness counted for more than his rank or riches . Seeing a lot of different people , and the different things they valued , had probably made me more tolerant than I might have been . Being alone at sea had changed me , too , making me more aware of my own strengths and weaknesses . Probably there are other changes in me , but I ca n't measure them . The journey had been an adventure all the way , even when it was an adventure in loneliness . Now it was over , and a new one was beginning .
