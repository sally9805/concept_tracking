Motorists approaching an entrance ramp along Massachusetts ' well-traveled Route 128 recently were pleasantly surprised at the ease with which they could enter the expressway . Instead of the usual pile-up along the ramp , car after car moved effortlessly into the mainstream of traffic . Drivers barely glanced back to look for an opening . They did not have to . Like the flashlight of a theater usher , moving green lights at the edge of the ramp led them surely and safely up and out onto the highway . <P> The guidance system that performed this small miracle was developed by Raytheon and is being tested by the U.S. Department of Transportation . It consists of a computer , guidance lights , three traffic lights and magnetic sensing loops embedded in the outside lane of the freeway and in the entrance ramp . As cars move over the sensors , the computer learns how many are on the ramp and whether there are gaps available for them on the highway . When a space shows up , the computer begins lighting the string of green lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that moves up the ramp . The motorist need only follow the pacer light by about a car length ; theoretically he will then reach the freeway in time to swing into the space allotted him . If no gaps are available , cars are stopped up to 15 seconds at one of the three traffic lights while the computer " looks " for an opening . Should there still be no space , a merge-with-caution sign advises the motorist to proceed on his own . <P> Unbelievably Successful . The system still has its own gaps . For example , a motorist who refuses or is unable to follow the pacer lights can frustrate the computer , which tries frantically to backtrack and pick up his car again . A second phase of the testing will involve a less complex arrangement of moving bands of green and white light on an electronic railing along the ramp ; a driver who can not or will not keep abreast of a green band ( programmed , like the pacer lights , to deliver him to a predetermined slot in highway traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up with one ahead or ignore the bands completely and go it alone . <P> Although the completed guidance system will not be ready for widespread installation for at least five years , those who kept pace with the pacers deemed the experiment unbelievably successful . " It is incredible , " marveled Woburn Supermarket Checker Jeannette Gillis . " When you pull out , there is n't a car there . " Most motorists , in fact , like Billerica Store Manager Bob Gaughan , found the system almost suspiciously painless . " I still had a tendency , " Gaughan remembers , " to turn around and look at the oncoming traffic . Just to make sure . "
