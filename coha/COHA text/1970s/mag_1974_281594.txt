She had been launched in an era of Gallic grandeur . From the moment that the France first slipped into the Loire estuary at St. Nazaire 14 years ago while French President Charles de Gaulle looked on , this ultimate luxury liner sailed the oceans as a glittering symbol of French elegance . A magnificent example of marine engineering , she was the longest ( 1,035 ft. ) and one of the fastest ( 30 knots ) passenger liners afloat . The service was superb ( the ratio of passengers to crew was less than 2 to 1 ) and so was the food . The France 's gourmet dining rooms , particularly the gold-walled Chambord , ranked among the best restaurants on land or sea , dispensing caviar , foie gras and champagne as if they were going out of style . <P> As a matter of fact , they were . Last week the France fell victim to a new era of French economic realism . After negotiations between government authorities and striking crewmen broke down , the French Line announced that it was canceling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully booked , and was pulling the ship out of service immediately . The decision left only the British Cunard Line and the Italian Line offering regular transatlantic service between Europe and the U.S. <P> Rebellious Sailors . The liner 's fate had been sealed last July , when French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing announced that the government could no longer afford to subsidize the ship . A fourfold increase in oil prices had pushed the liner 's estimated deficit to an intolerable rate of $21 million this year . Although the ship was to have been pulled out of service on Oct. 25 , the end was hastened when the crew went on strike two weeks ago as the liner approached Le Havre on its regular crossing from New York . Rebellious sailors forced the France 's captain , Christian Pettre , to drop anchor in the approach channel to Le Havre , blocking the harbor 's entrance to larger oil tankers . The crew then announced that they would occupy the ship until the government guaranteed jobs for the 3,000 or so employees who would be affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship 's 1,264 passengers were taken ashore on a Norwegian ferry . <P> The demonstration won strong support from the French Maritime Union , which staged a two-day sympathy strike and brought out thousands of demonstrators who marched along the quais of Le Havre shouting " Giscard at the helm , France is sinking , " -a parody of the President 's successful campaign slogan " Giscard at the helm . " <P> At week 's end the crew showed no signs of relinquishing control of the liner , boasting that they had enough provisions on board to last until Christmas . They had set up a mini-government complete with premier and ministers in charge of administration , maintenance , security , information , leisure , domestic life and social and medical problems . They were also publishing a daily newspaper and had even devised a special postmark for their mail . Apparently they were working even harder than usual to keep the France in tiptop shape . But they rejected a call by Premier Jacques Chirac to end the strike and resume talks . " We 've heard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll stay where we are until the government turns serious .
