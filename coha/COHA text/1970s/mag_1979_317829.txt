In a sunny office on the second floor of the White House 's West Wing , a myriad of complicated details were sorted out for this week 's visit of China 's Teng Hsiao-p'ing . There , too , strategy was being mapped for steering the President 's budget through Congress , fighting inflation and rallying support for SALT . The office is a control tower for the Administration , and much of the credit for the improving management of Jimmy Carter 's White House these days is being given to the tower 's occupant : Anne Wexler , 48 . <P> Acting as the Administration 's traffic controller is exactly what Wexler was expected to do when she was brought into the White House nine months ago as the top-ranking woman and one of eight presidential assistants . With the Administration 's popularity slipping and its programs bogged down in Congress , the relaxed Southern style of Carter 's closest aides needed a strong dose of discipline and management . These were talents Wexler had demonstrated amply at the Commerce Department , where she had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political organizer . She worked up from local to statewide campaigns in her home state of Connecticut , and then earned a reputation as a skilled operator at the 1968 and 1972 Democratic National Conventions . <P> Explaining her role in the White House , Wexler says : " There was a vacuum between the policy formulation stage and congressional enactment . They needed to create a base of support outside the Administration . " <P> Wexler 's tactics seldom vary . First she pores through her bulging black notebooks that detail an issue 's main features and its key advocates and critics . Then she invites interest groups to the White House to speak their minds . Later , potential supporters are asked back and told how they can aid the President on the issue . To help Carter 's moribund energy bill , for example , Wexler last year met with at least 1,000 state officials and farm , urban , religious , business and . consumer leaders . <P> During the drafting of the 1980 budget , Wexler held dozens of meetings with hundreds of Americans who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she made no promises , bluntly explaining that the deficit had to be kept down . But for some groups she did more . When big city mayors complained about federal cuts in urban aid , she arranged for them to meet Carter . After that session , the Administration boosted a key urban program by $150 million in the 1980 budget and asked that $200 million be added to this year 's appropriation . <P> Wexler works what has become a typical schedule for top Carter aides . At her desk by 7:45 a.m. , she rarely puts in less than a twelve-hour day . Saturday is spent at the office , planning for the following week . Says a White House aide : " The only person around here who is even better prepared for a meeting is Jimmy Carter . " She also lunches regularly on Saturday with her second husband , Joseph Duffey , chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities . They are one of Washington 's most powerful couples . Their combined federal salaries : $108,000 . Each has two grown sons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
