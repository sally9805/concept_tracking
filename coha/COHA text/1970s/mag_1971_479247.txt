upon my sense of worthiness . It has also been a kind of liberation and delight . There must be countless women in America who have known for years that something is peculiarly unfair , yet who have found it only recently possible , because of Women 's Liberation . to give tongue to their pain . In recent months : , I have experienced a similar inner thaw , a gradual relaxation , a willingness to think about feelings heretofore shepherded out of sight . I am born of PIGS ? those Poles . Italians , Greeks , and Slays , non-English-speaking immigrants , numbered so heavily among the workingmen of this nation . Not particularly liberal , nor radical , born into a history not white Anglo-Saxon and not Jewish ? born outside what in America is considered the intellectual mainstream . And thus privy to neither power nor status nor intellectual voice . Those Poles of Buffalo and Milwaukee ? so notoriously taciturn , sullen , nearly speechless . Who has ever understood them ? It is not that Poles do not feel emotion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , betrayal , courage , blood ? But where in America is there anywhere a language for voicing what a Christian Pole in this nation feels ? He has no Polish culture left him , no Polish tongue . Yet Polish feelings do not go easily into the idiom of happy America , the America of the Anglo-Saxons and , yes , in the arts , the Jews . ( The Jews have long been a culture of the word , accustomed to exile , skilled in scholarship and in reflection . The Christian Poles are largely of peasant origin , free men for hardly more than a hundred years . t Of what shall the man of Buffalo think , on his way to work in the mills , departing from his relatively dreary home and street ? What roots does he have ? What language of the heart is available to him ? The PIGS are not silent willingly . The silence burns like hidden coals in the chest .

We did not feel this country belonged to us . We felt fierce pride in it , more loyalty than anyone could know . But we felt blocked at every turn . There were not many intellectuals among us , not even very many professional men . Laborers mostly . Small businessmen . agents for corporations perhaps . Content with a little , yes , modest in expectation . But somehow feeling cheated . For a thousand years the Slovaks survived Hungarian hegemony , and our strategy here remained the same : endurance and steady work . Slowly , one day , we would overcome . A special word is required about a complicated symbol : sex . To this day my mother finds it hard to spell the word intact , preferring to write " s --  . " Not that much was made of sex in our environment . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances , exuberance Anglo-Saxons seldom seem to share ; but on the realities of sex , discretion . Reverence , perhaps : seriousness , surely . On intimacies , it is as though our tongues had been stolen . As though in peasant life for a thousand years the context had been otherwise . Passion , yes ; romance , yes ; family and children , certainly ; but sex , rather a minor part of life . Imagine , then , the conflict in the generation of my brothers , sister , and myself . 1The book critic for the New York Times reviews on the same day two new novels of fantasy : one a pornographic fantasy to end all such fantasies he writes , the other about a mad family representing in sonic comic way the redemption wrought by Jesus Christ .

XTET MORE SIGNIFICANT in the ethnic experi- 1 ence in America is the intellectual world one meets : the definition of values , ideas , and purposes emanating from universities , books , magazines , radio , and television . One hears one 's ownvoice echoed back neither by spokesmen of " Mid . dle America " ( so complacent , smug , mat ' ? ' nativist and Protestant ) , nor by " the intellectuals . " Al ' most unavoidably , perhaps , education in Amer. ica leads the student who entrusts his soul to it in a direction that , lacking a better word , might call liberal : respect for individual eon. science , a sense of social responsibility , trust it the free exchange of ideas and procedures of diy . sent , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together " and to adjudicate their differences , a frank recognition of the vitality of the unconscious , a willingness to protect workers and the poor against the vast economic power industrial corporations , and the like . On the other hand , the liberal imagination 114 appeared to be astonishingly universalist , and relentlessly missionary . Perhaps the metaphor " enlightenment " offers a key . One is initiated into light . Liberal education tends to separate children from their parents , from their roots , from their history , in the cause of a universal and superior religion . One is taught , regarding the unenlightened + even if they be one 's Uncles George and Peter , one 's parents , one 's brothers perhaps ) , what can only be called a modern equivalent of odium theologieum . Richard Hof. stadter described anti-intellectualism in America , more acuratelv in nativist America than in ethnic America , but I have yet to encounter a comparable treatment of anti-unenlightenment among our educated classes . In particular , I have regretted and keenly fell the absence of that sympathy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muster : that same sympathy that the educated find so easy to conjure up for hlacl culture , Chicano culture . Indian culture , and other cultures of the poor . In such cases , ow finds , the universalist pretensions of liberal cul ? cure are suspended : some groups , at least . are entitled to be both different and respected . Whr do the educated classes find it so difficult to want to understand the man who drives a beer trui or the fellow with a helmet working on a silt across the street with plumbers and electricians while their sensitivities race easily to Mississippi or even Bedford-Stuyvesant ? J There are deep secrets here , no doubt , voiced fantasies and scarcely admitted histor cal resentments . Few persons , in describin " Middle Americans , " " the Silent Majority , " Scammon and Wattenberg 's " typical Almeria voter , " distinguish clearly enough between Li nativist American and the ethnic American . first is likely to be Protestant , the second C Tic . Both may be , in various ways , conserva 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fears , betrayed expectations . Neither is ready , quite , to become an ally of the other . Neither has the same history behind him here . Neither has the same hopes . Neither is living out the same psychic voyage . Neither shares the same symbols or has the same sense of reality . The rhetoric and metaphors differ . There is overlap , of course . But country music is not a polka ; a successful politician in a Chicago ward needs a very different " common touch " from the one used by the county clerk in Normal : the urban experience of immigration lacks that mellifluous , optimistic , biblical vision of the good America that springs naturally to the lips of politicians from the Bible Belt . The nativist tends to believe with Richard Nixon that he " knows America and the American heart is good . " The ethnic tends to believe that every American who preceded him has an angle , and that he , by God , will one day find one too . ( Often , ethnics complain that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , and relying upon the American Dream they now have only their own na ? vet ? to blame for rising no higher than they have . I It goes without saying that the intellectuals do not love Middle America , and that for all the good warm discovery of America that preoccupied them during the 1950s. no strong tide of respect accumulated in their hearts for the Yahoos , Babbitts . Agnews , and Nixons of the land . Willie Morris . in North Toward Home , writes poignantly of the chill , parochial outreach of the liberal sensibility , its failure to engage the humanity of the modest , ordinary little man west of the Hudson . The intellectual 's map of the United States is succinct : Two coasts connected by United Airlines . " Unfortunately , it seems , the ethnics erred in attempting to Americanize themselves , before clearing the project with the educated classes . They learned to wave the flag and to send their sons to war . ( The Poles in World War I were 4 per cent of the population but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to support their President ? an easy task , after all , for those accustomed abroad to obeying authority . And where would they have been if Franklin Roosevelt had not sided with them against established interests ? They knew a little about Communism , the radicals among thrill in one way , and by far the larger number of conservatives in another . Not a few exchange letters to this clay with cousins and uncles who did not leave for America when they might have , whose lot is demonstrably harder and less than free . completion , when a generation appears speaks without accent and goes to college , you are considered pigs , fascists , and racists . Racists ? Our ancestors owned no slaves . M ? l of us ceased being serfs only in the last 200 years ? the Russians in 1861 . What have we IN against blacks or blacks against us ?

They want to grind off all the ogles , hold us to the lathes , shape us to be objec-ve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , of course , a new cleavage has sprung open among the intellectuals . Some seem to speak for technocracy ? for that alliance of science , industry , and humanism whose heaven is - progress . " Others seem to be taking the view once ascribed to ecclesiastical conservatives and traditionalists : that commitment to enlighten-ment is narrow , ideological , and hostile to the best interests of mankind . In the past , the great alliance for progress sprang from the conviction that " knowledge is power . " Both humanists and scientists could agree on that , and labored in their separate ways to make the institutions of knowledge dominant in society : break the shackles of the Church , extend suffrage to the middle classes and finally to all , win untrammeled liberty for the marketplace of ideas . Today it is no longer plain that the power brought by knowledge is humanistic . Thus the parting of the ways . Science has ever carried with it the stories and symbols of a major religion . It is ruthlessly universalist . If its participants are not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is n't bad . And every single action of the practicing scientist , no matter how humble , could once be understood as a contribution to the welfare of the human race ; each smallest gesture was invested with meaning , given a place in a scheme , and weighted with redemptive power . Moreover , the scientist was in iiossession of " the truth . " indeed of the very meaning of and validating procedures for the word . His role was therefore sacred . Imagine , then , a young strapping Slovak entering an introductory course in the Sociology of Religion at the nearby state university or community college . Is he sent back to his Slovak roots , led to recover paths of experience latent in all his instincts and reflexes , given an image of the life of his grandfather that suddenly , in recognition , brings tears to his eyes ? Is he brought to a deeper appreciation of his Lutheran or Catholic heritage and its resonances with other bodies of religious experience ? On the contrary , he is secretly taught disdain for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt or imagined through religious forms . In the boy 's psyche , a new religion is implanted : power over others , enlightenment , an atomic ( rather than a communitarian sensibility , a contempt for mystery , ritual , transcendence , soul , absurdity , and tragedy ; and deep confidence in the possibilities of building a better world through scientific understanding . He is led to feel ashamed for the statistical portrait of Slovak immigrants which shows them to he conservative , authoritarian , not given to dissent , etc . His teachers instruct him with the purest of intentions . in a way that is value free . To be sure , certain radical writers in America have begun to bewail " the laying on of culture " and to unmask the cultural religion implicit in the American way of science . Yet radicals . one learns , often have an agenda of their own . What fascinates them among working-class ethnics are the traces , now almost lost , of radical activities among the working class two or three generations ago . Scratch the resentful boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you will find hidden in their past some formerly imprisoned organizer for the CIO , some Sacco/ Vanzetti , some hold pamphleteer for the IWW . All this is true . But supposing that a study of the ethnic past reveals that most ethnics have been , are , and wish to remain . culturally conservative ? Suppose , for example , they wish to deepen their religious roots and defend their ethnic enclaves ? Must a radical culture be " laid on " them ? America has never confronted squarely the problem of preserving diversity . I can remember hearing in my youth bitter arguments that parochial schools were " divisive .. " NOW the public schools are attacked for their coninlitment to homogenization , Well , how does a nation of no one culture , no one language , no one race , no one history , no one ethnic stock continue to exist as one , while encouraging diversity ? How can the rights of all , and particularly of the weak , be defended if power is decentralized and left to local interests ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters of national organizations . But what happens when the national organizations themselves ? the schools , the unions , the federal government ? become vehicles of a new , universalistic , thoroughly rationalized , technological culture ? Still , it is not that larger question that concerns me here . I am content today to voice the difficulties in the way of saying what I wish 14 say , when I wish to say it . The tradition of liberal . ism is a tradition I have had to acquire , despite an innate skepticism about many of its structural metaphors I free marketplace , individual autos. only , reason naked and undisguised , enlighten . ment I. Radicalism , with its bold and simple optimism about human potential and its anarchic tendencies , has been , despite its appeal to me as a vehicle for criticizing liberalism , freighted with emotions , sentiments , and convictions about tneu that I can not bring myself to share . leaves it meaningful ; the " state of nature " seem , to me , emotionally , far less liberating , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long in the profession of the intellectual life that I find it easy to be critical and harsh . In al ? most everything I see or hear or read , I am struck first , rather undiscriminatingly , by all the things I like in it , Only with second effort can I bring myself to discern the flaws . My emotions and values seem to run in affirmative patterns . My interest is not , in fact , in defining myself over against the American people and the American way of life . I do not expect as much of it as all that . What I should like to do is come to a better and more profound knowledge of who I am , whence my community came , and whither my son and daughter , and their children 's children , might wish to head in the future : I want to have a history . More and more , I think in family terms , le* ambitiously , on a less than national scale . The differences implicit in being Slovak . and Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Perhaps it is too much to try to speak to all peoples in this very various nation of ours . Yet it does not seem evident that by becoming more concrete , accepting one 's finite and limited identity , one necessarily becomes parochial . Quite the opposite . It seems more likely that by each of us becoming more profoundly what we are , we shall find greater unity , in those depths in which unity irradiates diversity , than by attempting through the artifices of the American " melting pot " and the cultural religion of science to become what we are not . There is , I take it , a form of liberalism not wedded to universal Reason , whose ambition is not to homogenize all peoples on this planet , and whose base lies rather in the imagination and in the diversity of human stories : a liberalism should be happy to have others help me to find .
