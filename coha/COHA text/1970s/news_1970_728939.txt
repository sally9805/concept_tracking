txt Letters pg . 228 Letters PAT , YES ; JUDITH , NO To THE EDITOR : Judith Viorst 's article , " Pat Nixon Is the Ultimate Good Sport " ( Sept. 13 ) , was the ultimate in poor taste . Her bias against our First Lady was all too evident . After half-hearted acknowledgment of Mrs. Nixon 's many outstanding qualities , and a slurring reference to her courageous visit to the scene of . Peru 's earthquake , she stooped to the level of a scribbler for a scandal sheet by imputing from dubious hearsay and innuendo that the marital relations between the occupants of the White House are not entirely harmonious . This , I submit , was unpardonable . It is unfortunate that The Times saw fit to print such a derogatory piece about a gifted woman who overcame early adversity to become one of the most gracious First Ladies ever to occupy the White House , and whose splendid example should be an inspiration to womankind everywhere . NORMAN L. BARNETr . Brooklyn . ? To THE EDITOR : Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon is the author 's apparent inability to realize that Mrs. Nixon does not exist to provide her with good newspaper copy . The Nixons , contrary to what seem to be Miss Viorst 's expectations , are not required under the terms of President Nixon 's contract with us to divulge their innermost secrets to her . There is drama in Pat Nixon 's life  --  high drama at that  --  but the writer failed to see it in her search for more sophisticated ways of writing goo about the Nixon ? married life . We are told that Mrs. Nixon was spat on in Venezuela , that she was orphaned early in life , and that she had to struggle hard for an education . These facts are noted and then ignored , while the author builds a shabby edifice around insinuations that good rapport with her children , abstention from public displays of affection , and even iron-Ing her husband 's suits make Mrs. Nixon somehow odd . Readers of The Times Magazine do not expect a writer to ooze as correspondents for some journals do . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman // Letters // such as Pat Nixon as a strong , self-made farm girl , true to her husband , proud of her country , and fiercely jealous of a right which- some reporters deny exists -- privacy . ARTHUR J. HUGHES , Ph.D. , Associate Professor of History , St. Francis College . Brooklyn . ? , To THE EDITOR : Judith Viorst 's article on Mrs. Nixon is one of ' the bitchiest pieces of . reporting that I have ever read . What does she want  --  Pat Nixon to walk around braless in a Tshirt with unwashed hair ? Would this make her an antiheroine type ? I 'm so damned fed up with pompous writers who commit personality assassination , sit in judgment as though they were scribbling from a chair at the right hand of God . Perhaps it is such a long time since Judith Viorst has met a real lady that she fails to recognize one ! MTS . RAMON L. WALESKL . Emerson , N.J. OPEN AND SHOT To THE Emma : Prof. Philip Green 's article , " Can It Happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ) begins by quoting a campus employe who asked campus protesters if they were aware of the " fascist " implications of their clenched - fist salute . No wonder the students " did not know " that this was the case . Indeed , it was not . The clenched fist has always been the revolutionary Socialist or Communist salute . Mussolini , an ex-Socialist , wanted to remind Italians of the proud history of Imperial Rome by using the old Roman salute of - the open right hand . The Nazis copied this salute " from the Italian Fascists and accompanied it with a shout of " Heil Hitler ! " Neither Fascists nor Nazis ever used the clenched fist . Ironically , the ancient Roman greeting originated as an indication of peaceful intent ? the open hand can not hold a weapon . MORLEY AYEARST . East Hampton , N. Y. SNOBS . BOOBS AND THE GEOGRAPHIC To THE EDITOR : In reading think I discovered one of the reasons why many Americans dislike " liberal intellectuals . " It is not the lofty social philosophy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and institutions . not obsessed with crises . The National Geographic has many pretty pictures of mountains and valleys , and none of burning , ghettos , segregated restrooms or Vietnamese hamlets destroyed by napalm , so it is relegated to a place beside TV Guide and The Reader 's Digest as pablum for the masses . My first impulse on reaching the final demeaning paragraph of Mr. Buckley 's article was to rush to cancel my subscription before I , too , was thought to have a short attention span , fear of creeping socialism , fading vision , and residence in a retirement home . My second impulse was // ANTI-FASCIST  --  Foreign volunteers fighting with the Loyalists against Franco in the Spanish Civil War give a clenched-fist salute . // to begin disliking Tom Buckley for his snobbery . Why ? He thinks I 'm a boob because I like The National Geographic . I do n't like anybody who thinks I 'm a boob , and I suspect few people do . We who characterize ourselves as intellectuals are indeed beset by snobbery , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as boobs with their Reader 's Digest , TV Guide , TV game shows , archaic social principles and fear of the International Communist Conspiracy , and now their National Geographic . And the Middle Americans return the compliment . They call us pointy-heads . I can understand why , now that I with my National Geographic have been turned ignobly out of the temple . ROBERT NACHTRIEB . Arlington , Va . DISCRIMINATION Dl UNIONS To THE EDITOR : Regardless of one 's reactions to Michael Harrington 's politics as stated in his article , " A Radical Strategy  --  Do n't Form a Fourth Party ; Form a New First Party " ( Sept 13 ) , it is necessary to note his unfortunate habit ? of confusing opinion with fact . He attacks " the middleclass critics of the labor movement , " because they " do not know that the patterns of intolerable discrimination exist in a declining minority of the unions and almost exclusively in the old-fashioned strongholds of craft organizations . " He further states that lithe mass production union , organized on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire society and has unquestionably done more to subvert the economic basis of racism than any other force . " Not only are these statements questionable , they directly contradict the facts . Findings by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , in response to complaints filed by black workers , document broad patterns of discriminatory racial practices by many industrial unions . These unions in conjunction with employers frequently limit black workers to the least-desirable , lowest-paying jobs and deny them equal seniority and promotional rights . Furthermore , the Federal Courts have declared in several recent cases involving industrial unions , such as the United Paperworkers and Papermakers Union among others , that separate racial seniority lines and other nrovisions in union contracts requiring job assignments on the basis of race to be violations of the law . But many industrial unions continue their defiance of the law and are defending their traditional racist practices in complex court challenges . The legal departments of many unions are now busily engaged in introducing a tangle of procedural legal questions in an attempt to prevent change by conducting a rear-guard holding action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southern school districts after the Supreme Court decision in the school segregation cases . A typical example of this is to be found in the current litigation against the United Steel Workers of America ( A.F.L.-C.I.O. ) , a major industrial union with a " liberal " reputation . This union is vigorously defending its traditional discriminatory practices in a series of lawsuits in Ohio , Texas , Alabama and West Virginia . Litigation brought by black workers involves charges that the union maintains illegal discriminatory provisions in its contracts with major steel companies . There have been almost two decades of protest by black steelworkers , but the Steelworkers Union , like other industrial unions , has refused to eliminate their long - standing discriminatory practices . In contrast to the craft unions , such as in the building trades , which overtly use their power to exclude nonwhites from jobs , the discriminatory practices of many industrial unions occur after black workers have been employed . Even in the United Auto Workers Union , certainly the best of the industrial unions on the issue of race , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to the skilled trades department of the union as the " Deep South of the U.A.W. " In his article , Mr. Harrington attacks " sophisticated ignorance , " but he has provided an unfortunate instance of this himself . In his discussion of the racial practices of organized labor he has again given an example of that old adage about " not letting the facts get in the way of a theory . " HERBERT HILL , National Labor Director , N.A.A.C.P. New York . Mr. Harrington replies : " Although Mr. Hill 's tone is rather sharp ? I am charged . with having nothing left than an ' unfortunate habit ' of confusing opinion with fact ? nothing in his letter contradicts my article . On the contrary , he corroborates my main point . " I wrote that most middleclass reformers derive their image of the labor movement from the exclusionary hiring policy enforced by a minority of building trades unions . In fact , I said , the industrial unions , which are increasingly the dominant type of organization in America , are enrolling more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subvert the economic basis of racism than any other development in this society . " Mr. Hill agrees with me for he admits that the discrimination he alleges against industrial unions does not occur in hiring , but afterwards . So he too must recognize that the unions are the most integrated institutions in society . His point is-that once the integration takes place , all is not idyllic even though black workers have won much better wages than before . " But even on this latter count  --  which I did not raise and which involves complexities which go far beyond the limits of the Letters column ? Mr. Hill simplifies . He omits to note that the fair employment practices section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which is one of the legal bases of some of the court suits he describes , was included in that law at the vigorous insistence of the A.F.L.-C.I.O . He ignores the fact that separate seniority lists are sometimes company , not union , policy . And he fails to report that some of the disputes he cites are not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " So Mr. Hill backs my main point : that a growing number of blacks are becoming union members and winning higher living standards in the ? rocess . It is this fact which led me to state that the labor movement is the greatest potential source of real black power in America . If reformers close their eyes to this enormously hopeful trend , if they , like Mr. Hill , act as if the largest domestic social movement in the country is an enemy , there will be no progressive change for blacks or for anyone else . Only if the minorities , the poor and the middle-class reformers unite politically with the millions upon millions of organized working people is there a chance to make serious advances . That will not be easy , but it is our only hope . " OBESITY AND LONGEVITY To THE EDITOR : In the article , " The Fat Child Is Father of the Man , " by Barbara W. Wyden , Sept. 13 , I was quoted as saying : " If you are obese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obese and take off weight , will you live longer ? No one has proved that you will . " Unfortunately , as printed the quotation is incomplete and out of context . The statement was made during a discussion of the difficulties encountered by obese individuals in maintaining - the reduced state once the desired weight loss is achieved . Most obese patients find themselves in a vicious cycle of weight loss followed by a reaccumulation of fat once dietary restrictions are relaxed . It is , therefore , presently impossible to properly evaluate the effect of weight loss on longevity , since we lack sufficient data regarding extended periods of weight loss . Thus one can not prove or disprove the point , and the words " or disproved " should have been included in the quotation . The statement was not meant to imply ( as seems indicated by its position in the article ) that obese individuals should not reduce . Quite the contrary  --  one hopes that future research will provide the means whereby - long- term weight loss can be effectively achieved . Indeed , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when weight loss is achieved . Whether or not this improvement will result in longer life can only be ascertained if the weight loss is maintained . It is only by concentrating our efforts on the period after the initial weight reduction has been attained that we can hope to find the answers to this and other long-range problems besetting the obese individual . Finally , although longevity is certainly a major consideration , there are many other medical and cultural factors that make weight reduction ? in obese individuals desirable . JEROME L.

COURTNEY WHITNEY To THE EDITOR : Faubion Bowers 's rejoinder to my letter in the Sept. 13 Magazine has got to be a new kind of low in verbal mugging . My " late , unlamented " father ?
