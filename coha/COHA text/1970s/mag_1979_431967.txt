 | A WRITING WOMAN At what point does autobiography graduate into memory shaped by art ? How does a writer know when to stop telling it as it is or was and make of truth a superior fiction ? Readers and writers alike perennially ponder such questions . O n weekend mornings my mother sat at the typewriter in a sunny breakfast nook and wrote stories about women , young women like herself , who , after some difficulty necessary to the plot , got their men . In the adjoining kitchen , my grandmother washed the breakfast dishes and kept asking , " What do you two think you could eat for lunch ? " My mother and I would groan in unison . Who could imagine lunch when we 'd just finished breakfast ? Besides , we had more important things to do than eat . Already , at the age of five , I had allied myself with the typewriter rather than the stove .

Meanwhile , she at Cr. stove ran our mundane life . Still new to the outrageous vulnerability of widowhood , she was glad to pia , Martha to my mother 's Mary . In our manless little . family , she also played Mother , and could be counter on to cook , sew on buttons , polish the piano , and gig encouragement to creative endeavors . She was m. mother 's first reader , while the stories were still their morning draft ; " It moves a little slowly here . she 'd say , or , " I do n't understand why the girl dic this .

To my grandmother 's Mother , my mother playec Father ; she was the provider . She took her skills off tv the next town each weekday on the bus and returnee home at night , rumpled and exhausted and as in neec of being waited on as any man . Lucky for her , most o ' the men were overseas at war , and the Asheville Citizen needed reporters . Out she went daily ; at the new . Army hospital , she interviewed wounded soldiers wh , had been flown back home ; she followed Eleanor Roosevelt all over town one day and bore the brunt of a restaurant owner 's ire when Mrs. R. insisted upon taking a local black civic leader to lunch ; in her college French she interviewed Bela Bartok ; whenever Mrs Wolfe phoned the paper to announce , " I have just remembered something else about Tom , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on Spruce Street .

My mother was still young , pretty as any of the girls who stepped off trains or entered fateful rooms in her stories .

At Chapel Hill , she often had five dates in one day and the energy of the true candle burner-at-both-ends ; she thought nothing of staying up during what was left of the night , typing nineteen-page term papers , or writing her own plays . But at home one weekend , she was playing bridge with her girlfriends on the porch when a man limped by . It was Mose Winston Godwin , the handsome local bachelor , who had snapped his ankle playing tennis .

All the stories that bought my clothes , my storybook dolls , my subscriptions to children 's rnagazines , were contained by , were imprisoned in , that plot . Did my young divorced mother , while typing in that suntilled breakfast nook , ever have moments of bitter irony when she was tempted to rip out the " happily ever after " lie she was perpetrating , roll a fresh sheet into the carriage , and tell her own story ? It would have been much more interesting . But here is a story that my mother did not write : A woman , coming home late from her creative writing class , walks past the Casa Loma nightclub on the way to her bus stop . She sees a man go in , a handsome , laughing , well-dressed man with his arm around a platinum blond .

He has not seen the woman in the rumpled tweed suit , downstairs in the night . An irresistible impulse rises in her . She goes to the nearest phone and calls the police and identifies herself . They remember her , from her wartime job at the paper ; many of them had taken turns driving her home during the blackouts . She has my father locked up . She misses her bus , but boards the next one and rides through the starry night , a weird joy throbbing through her veins and making her feel lightheaded .

At what point does regurgitated autobiography graduate into memory shaped by art ? How do you know when to stop telling it as it is , or was , and make it into what it ought to be ? or what would make a better story ? I sat down to write my first story at age nine . What was the story about ? A henpecked husband named 011ie McGonnigle , who insults a man one morning only to come home that evening and discover that his wife has invited that same man to dinner .

This novel , called And Not To Yield , contained , to my memory , some of the most erotic love scenes I have ever read . Amazing , when you think of it : the sheltered little girl and her grandmother , sitting down each  | evening to read the next installment of And Not To Yield . It was fiction , of course . My grandmother had not approved of the new groom , but this book was interesting . Hmmm . " Your mother certainly knows how to keep a reader 's interest , " my grandmother said , moistening her thumb to turn the page .

One about a little rich boy , who lived all day behind elegant iron gates and had everything he wanted except a friend he could confide in . My mother miscarried her first son . Her husband got a job as a management trainee at Kress , for $45 a week . A courtly older man in town , the renowned local portrait painter ( also the man who taught my mother in creative writing class ) , painted my mother 's portrait in oils . In the portrait she wore a jade green silk blouse and a gold Chinese pin . She also wore an enigmatic smile . She started a new novel about a famous woman writer with two men after her .

At the end of the novel , the successful writer heroine is told by her ex-husband that her writing has become too facile and shallow . Having lost both the portrait painter and her writing , she turns to religion . When she has chastened herself sufficiently , she remarries her ex-husband . This novel was called The Everlasting Door . It went the round of the publishers . Take out the religion , some publishers said . Take out the sex , said others , and maybe a religious house would be interested . Begin again . My mother had a baby girl . I was fifteen and fell in love with an athlete nobody approved of but me .

In Norfolk , we knew not one soul . There was a whole summer ahead of me in which to smolder over the injustice of society . I borrowed my mother 's typewriter and wrote a shor : novel called I Broke the Code . I have this piece of work before me now , an interesting artifact : part truth , part lie ; part gauche attempt at craft ( " True , some wi : believe the worst , but I like to think that every small town has a forgiving streak that crosses right down i center like the railroad tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shame rushed through me " ) . Pretty disguste , : with the results , I condescended and sent it to Tri Confessions , which returned it with the reader 's not : clipped to the top : " Some good writing but overdone Also much too long . Also nothing much happens . " My mother had another miscarriage in Norfolk . Like me , she had no friends yet . So she organized a local Toastmistress Club . her civic specialty , begun back in Asheville when , after hearing a Red Cross volunteer open her speech with . " Ladies , our deficit is astounding , " my mother decided it was indeed , and that women should do better than this . Now Norfolk women flocked to learn how to organize their thoughts and project their voices before crowds . My mother was gratified ; her spunk returned " Oh , what the hell , " she said .

Complications arise when Mark discovers Debby on campus . He remembers her from her other life . They had a night together before he shipped out with his regiment for France . Further complications arise when Jane discovers she is a lesbian and deeply loves her roommate Lisa . I loved that novel .

He ites her to come and live with him in his sumptuous use . ( " Keep it , " his rich second wife had said , " I never had a happy moment in it .

In real life , it was he , not the daughter , who left first . For some reason , he took off his watch and placed it on the bedside table . His wife returned from the grocery store and found him lying on the floor , but with his head off the rue to spare her the necessity of dry cleaning it .

ATTRACTIVE TERMS . Many months went by and no response . I called directory assistance . The agency had no phone . I went around to the address . It was an empty building . I had made only one copy of Gull Key . @# The City Literary Institute was located in a cavernous old building in north London . Somebody said it had been a prison in Dickens 's time . But once I discovered it , I attended it every Tuesday evening with the desperate faith of an afflicted person attending a religious shrine . I was badly in need of a miracle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had wanted to be since the age o ' five : a writer . True , I wrote every evening , long . exhaustive entries in my journal , to compensate for m boring days . I had stayed for three years in my Cushy government job ? helping the British plan their holidays in the United States though I had intended to stay one year . I had begun countless stories and novels . but there was something " off " about all of them Either they had the ring of self-consciousness abou : them , or they started too slowly and petered out before I ever got to the interesting material that had inspired me in the first place , or they were so close to the current problems of my own life that I could n't gair the proper distance and perspective . Our teacher at the City Literary Institute was an appealing woman who looked as though she had stepped out of another century . She wore her dark hair like Charlotte Bronte did ; her skirts were much to , long for fashion . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to us from the great writers ( When I reread Chekov 's " Anyuta " recently , i. seemed flat without Miss S ' s enthusiastic intonztions and pregnant pauses . ) But however she looked our teacher was a thoroughly modern woman and something of a heroine . She worked daytimes as ar editor in a prominent publishing house , did interview , for the BBC on weekends , and taught these classes t , support herself and her small illegitimate son . Miss S not only knew what good fiction was , she could tel. you why it was good ; she at once zeroed in on me , and . with a modicum of English tact , told me why m ' fiction was n't working . That she was able to tell me. moreover to prescribe exercises to correct my faults . was my good fortune . The first exercise she gave me was to write a story o ' 200 words . Two hundred words is less than a typewritten page . Therefore it is necessary to get at the heart o. the matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preludes or " artistic " posturings . Write a story of 300 words . Write a story of 45 ( words , beginning with this sentence : " Run away , he muttered to himself , sitting up and biting hi , nails . When that must be your first sentence , it excludes story about a woman in her late twenties , adrift among the options of wifehood , career , vocation , a story which I had begun too many times already both in fictior and in reality ? and could not resolve . My teachewisely understood Gide 's maxim for himself as Writer " The best means of learning to know oneself is seeking to understand others . " At last the evening came when I was invited by Miss S to read my latest story to the class . I was up t , 4500 words by then . The story was about an English (  | vicar who has seen God , writes a small book about his experience , and becomes famous . He gets caught up in the international lecture-tour circuit and winds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the South . He is at his lowest point , having parroted his own written words until he has lost touch with their meaning . He fears that , given the present pace and pressure of his public life , he will never again approach that private , meditative state of mind that brought God into focus for him . Many drafts and two years later , this story , first titled " The Illumined Moment ? and Consequences , " later " An Intermediate Stop , " would get me accepted into the Iowa Writers ' Workshop . " She has some affectations , but we 'll prune them , " wrote a member of the reading committee on the bottom of my application . @# fter I had read my story to Miss S ?

His name was Dr. Marshall , and even the astute Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a tall , dark , scowling man with a slight limp who came to class with a motorcycle helmet under his arm , often accompanied by a horsey woman carrying a motorcycle helmet under her arm . Tonight , however , his companion had not come , and after we had discussed certain religious images in my story , he told me he was a psychotherapist . We discovered we lived on the same street in Chelsea , and he rode me home that evening on the back of his Vespa . Within two months we were married and I had time , as did my character Dane Empson , the American girl in The Perfectionists , to meditate amply upon the consequences of our impulsiveness . It had been , on both our parts , a " nervous attachment , rathgr than a sexual love , " as D. H. Lawrence described the marriage of the couple in St. Mawr , a work I had the misfortune to discover after I became Mrs. Marshall . For one year , we did our best to drive each other crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nightmarish vacation in Majorca ; the figurative truths of that year , if not the literal ones , were to become my first published novel . But to give credit where it is due , this man who was impossible as my mate was the person who may well have made it possible for me to start being the writer I knew I could be . And I do n't mean the obvious ? that our marriage was to become the material for my novel . As I have mentioned , he was a psychotherapist , and @# during our year together I saw him do wonders for several people . Some doctors are extraordinarily gifted as diagnosticians , and he was one of them ; also , he was willing to try the most unorthodox of cures . This bothered me at the time ; more conventional than I am now . I wanted him to declare himself a Jungian , a Freudian . Meanwhile , off he went to a Scientology lecture , to see what useful ideas he could derive from that controversial organization . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method he had picked up from the Scientologists . It consisted in asking the patient the same question over and over again until the patien : came up with an answer that set off a feeling of " release " in him , a relieving certainty that he had at last really answered the question . Shortly after our fiasco-vacation in Majorca , and just before I was to depart for a visit to the United States from which I suspect both of us unconsciouslyknew I would not return , we sat under a very olc mulberry tree , which was staked and wired together t preserve it as long as possible . It was known locally as Sir Thomas More 's mulberry , though that woulc have made it over four hundred years old . The building where we lived was on land that had once beer his .
