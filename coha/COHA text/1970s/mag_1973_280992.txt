THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY <P> by ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR . 505 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $10 . <P> America has a bad ache in its body politic . Nobody is sure whether the cause will fade away , linger on for three years , be drastically removed by a blunt legal instrument called impeachment , or yield to the less painful therapy of resignation . In the midst of such uncertainties , a measure of literary relief and historical perspective may be taken from the latest presidency book , this one by Arthur Schlesinger Jr . <P> The author , it should be admitted , has been a movie reviewer for Vogue , served as a knight in Jack Kennedy 's Camelot and is now a proud member of the Nixon White House 's hate list . He once wrote an article explaining how George McGovern would win the 1972 election . But he is also a distinguished Harvard historian who has won two Pulitzer prizes for books on the presidency ( The Age of Jackson , 1946 ; John F. Kennedy , The Thousand Days , 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpations of congressional power lightly . His account of how the Nixon White House systematically used intimidation , impoundment of funds , secrecy and thin , though sinister invocations of " national security " and presidential prerogative to change the balance of constitutional power in the U.S. is the most deadly and lucid yet seen in print . At the end of the book Schlesinger urges impeachment . <P> But Schlesinger has an Olympian gift for writing about the present as if it were history . Impeachment or not , he seems to take for granted that Richard Nixon 's threat to the presidency is at an end . It is this possibly premature sense of post-Nixonian perspective that allows him to look back on the Viet Nam War as a blessing in disguise . Americans have long wondered whether the democratic consultations and the separation of powers required by the Constitution were compatible with modern world power . Since World War II , most of us ( including Schlesinger , as he admits ) concluded that only the Chief Executive , armed with superior expertise , and an enormous capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises . All that , Schlesinger writes , " went down in flames in Viet Nam . " We are now free to try again the old sloppy democratic way of common sense and congressional consultation . <P> It may be so . The author , at any rate , reaches this vantage point only after a brilliant forced march through history . The legal powers of the President he sees as being continually modified by a conception of John Locke-never made explicit by the Constitution , but very much in the minds of the founding fathers - that a democratic leader in a genuine emergency has the prerogative to act according to his discretion for the public good , provided he checks it out with the people and the legislature afterward . Through a succession of skirmishes and undeclared wars , and various employments of Executive agreements ( which tended to trim congressional treaty-making powers ) , Schlesinger feels that the interplay between President and Congress remained fairly reasonable for more than 150 years .                 @ @ @ @
