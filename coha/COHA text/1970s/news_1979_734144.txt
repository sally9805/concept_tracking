txt The accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant was a rite of passage : a painful but long-anticipated initiation of US society into one of the realities of the atomic age . Thus , as nuclear engineers bring conditions within the reactor under control , the critical question shifts to how the American public will react to the events of the past eight days . Will the incident serve as . a type of radiation badge of courage that will dissolve some of the societal fears that have surrounded the long-debated ? but until now hypothetical . ? hazards of nuclear power ? Or will this be the atomic industry 's equivalent of the Tet offensive in Vietnam that turned the tide of public opinion against it ? Whether public response swings to one of these two extremes or falls somewhere in between , as is more likely , the US nuclear industry faces a turbulent period of change , knowledgeable observers predict . The outcome of this re-evaluation and restructuring will affect not only the United States , but also the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas and another 435 planned or under construction . Robert Kates of Clark University in Worcester , Massachusetts , was part of an interdisciplinary team of scientists that has investigated nuclear safety issues . " We were struck by the similarity between the public opinion polls during the first years of the Vietnamese war and those regarding nuclear energy , " the professor of geography said . About 60 percent of the American public was for and 40 percent against both the Vietnam war effort and the nuclear power program , he explained . The percentages in both cases remained unusually stable for a period of years . In both cases , most of those voting in support did not do so with strong conviction . And a sizable minority was violent and vociferous in its opposition . With the Tet offensive in Vietnam , however , this pattern was broken , and public opinion thereafter swung increasingly against the war . " In our thinking about the first major accident , we envisioned two possible outcomes , " said Professor Kates . " If the first accident were a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , it would spell the end . But if the first incident were moderate and handled very smoothly , we anticipated , public anxiety would decrease , similar to what happens when people cope successfully with a small flood . " // From page .1 How will public take jarring A- power encounter ? The Three Mile Island experience falls squarely between these two hypothetical cases , Professor Kates says . While the radioactive releases from the reactor have thus far proved inconsequential , the manner in which the incident was handled has not inspired public confidence , in his opinion . " The stage may be set for what is an exceedingly rare event in our society : the rejection of a technology . It has only happened once before with the defeat of the supersonic transport . " says Professor Kates . Of cour'e. there are many differences between nuclear energy and either the SST or the Vietnam war . Currently , nuclear reactors turn out 13 percent of the nation 's electricity , an amount equivalent to the total US electric demand at the end of World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of nuclear reactors from 1980 to 2010 , made by the Oak Ridge Institute for Energy Analysis . are that the cost would total about $300 billion ; 50,000 jobs would be temporarily lost ; and an extra 2.6 billion tons of coal would be mined and burned , with proportional increases in sulfur dioxide and other pollutants . These figures were based on the extremely low energy growth rate of 1.5 percent per year . Economist Hans Landsberg of Resources for the Future participated in a past study of nuclear energy . " As far as safety and health effects go . nuclear is better than coal on average , " he has concluded . " However , the public does n't average , and coal does not have this kind of scare potential , " he adds . Still , the difficulty and cost of increasing use of coal in an environmentally safe manner drives many energy experts into the pro-nuclear camp . " We just do n't believe it is possible to increase coal production fast enough , " says Floyd Culler , director of the Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see this spell the end of nuclear energy , because I just do n't think we can do without it , " Mr. Landsberg concurs . Another social scientist , Otis Dudley Duncan of the University of Arizona , believes that this incident may actually prove beneficial to atomic energy in the long run : " I have the slightly outrageous idea that the nuclear industry has needed some of these moderate accidents . They will show people that they can be lived through . " This is the perspective the nuclear industry is clinging to . " Critics say this is the beginning of the end . I say it is the end of the beginning . We are now an industry which can have accidents . Our worst so far is not ' bad at all , " says Carl Goldstein of the Atomic Industrial Forum . Historically , controversy has surrounded the introduction of a number of new technologies . It once was the law in New York that an automobile could only be operated if a person ran in front waving a warning flag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opposition , and unusually stringent federal standards for boiler construction were enacted . Similarly , emotional debates concerning the dangers of electricity raged at the time of its introduction . The similarities between these historic events and the situation regarding nuclear energy suggest that the current controversy may be a passing phase and that increasing familiarity may lead to acceptance . In the past , polls have consistently shown that a large percentage of the US public does not even realize that nuclear power plants are in operation . On the other hand , there appear to be a number of differences between this situation and those in the past that could invalidate this analogy . " All of our polling and studies put nuclear in a class by itself , " says Professor Kates . It frightens people more than other disasters because they can not understand its basic nature . It is inaccessible because of the invisibility of radiation and the technical jargon of experts . Only a decade ago , technological advances were accepted with little quesiton . In the preamble of the Atomic Energy Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary impact " on American society was matter-of-factly stated as inherently good . No longer is this the case . This new attitude is reflected not only in the US , but also in other industrialized countries . There are active anti-nuclear movements in most developed nations . However , countries such as France , West Germany , and Japan have far fewer options than does the United States , with its vast domestic energy reserves . So in the days following the Three Mile Island accident , officials in these and a number of other governments have restated their commitment to nuclear power . Should public opinion in Europe and Japan swing more strongly against commercial nuclear power as a result of events in the US , the result is likely to be an increase in sabotage and terrorist activity rather than a cessation of nuclear plant construction , Professor Kates believes . In the US , it is quite possible that  --  even if public opinion does not turn strongly against it  --  the growth of nuclear power could be halted . " I am most concerned about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although most studies indicate that nuclear energy is slightly cheaper than coal , this key group may conclude that the problems with nuclear are just too great . Already the parent utility of Metropolitan Edison , which operates Three Mile Island , has canceled an order for two additional reactors . " I believe that electric utilities . . . will want to re-examine carefully the viability of building nuclear power plants , " said Alex Radin , head of the American Public Power Association , in a speech April 3 . Those utilities already committed to nuclear energy are also re-evaluating their positions , says Dr. Culler of EPRI . " I have had many conversations with utility officials in the past few days , " he said , " and I see a new maturity . Many are realizing that they have relied too heavily on the expertise of the reactor manufacturers and the engineer-architects who design the plants . " The outcome of this may be an extensive safety review of nuclear reactors conducted by the utilities themselves . This will be in addition to the almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident .
