FOREIGN RELATIONS/COVER STORY <P> " It is a new world that calls for a new American foreign policy . " <P> To that ringing declaration , made at the University of Notre Dame last May , Jimmy Carter might have added " You can depend on it ! " In his half-year in office , the President has gone far toward creating a new American foreign policy , both in content and conduct . He has tirelessly emphasized - some might say preached-the virtues of open diplomacy and moral principles as a substitute for what he contends was the often secretive and sometimes amoral Realpolitik of the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger years . He has spent an extraordinary amount of time on foreign affairs and has made more news in dealing with the world than with domestic concerns . He has sent off his emissaries in all directions and tried to tackle virtually all major international problems simultaneously . <P> All this activity and rhetoric has had a significant effect at home . After the guilt-ridden defeat in Viet Nam and the shocks of Watergate , Carter has given many Americans a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . He has done this in his own special style , but in the tradition of Wilson , Roosevelt and Dulles , who , in very different ways , affirmed that U.S. foreign policy must have a moral content . <P> At the same time , Carter has greatly alarmed both traditional friends and adversaries abroad and raised serious questions about his aims and methods in foreign policy . In the U.S. , quite a few members of the mainly Democratic foreign policy Establishment are beginning to wonder whether he is really up to the job . Nothing serious has been lost so far and much may yet be gained from Carter 's obvious good intentions , his openness to new ideas and his ability to inspire those who see or hear him . But the general pattern of his foreign policy actions creates genuine cause for worry about troubles ahead . <P> Having boldly jumped into the world arena like a Daniel in the Lions ' den , Carter is finding that the inhabitants have quite a bite .

" French <P> President Valry Giscard d'Estaing says that Carter " has compromised the process of detente , " while West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has complained that Carter " acts like a faith healer " and formulates " policy from the pulpit . " <P> The impression is growing that Carter 's overall strategy is flawed , that his sense of priorities is unrealistic and that some of his tactics are counterproductive . As he has often done in domestic affairs , he sometimes seems to think that enunciating a great goal is the same as doing something about it . Is Carter simply an idealist , applying Southern Baptist religiosity and New World populism to the complexities of diplomacy ? Or is he shrewd , even Machiavellian , bobbing here and weaving there in order to camouflage his pursuit of some well-wrought global goals ? Or is he , perhaps , merely inexperienced and naive ? <P> No doubt the one-term Georgia Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt , much of his world view is rooted in
