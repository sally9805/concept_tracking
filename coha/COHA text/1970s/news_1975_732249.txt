txt At one minute before noon last Wednesday , New Yorkers and the nation had every reason to expect that months of growing malaise over New York 's deepening fiscal crisis and its potential consequences for the city and nation would soon be ended . Representative Henry Reuss of Wtsconstn , cnairman of the House banking committee , was at that moment hurrying to . the House floor to open debate on a bill that would authorize Federal loan guarantees sufficient to enable the city to avoid default while working its own way back to self-sufficient solvency . The bill represented months of.study and debate which had produced a rapidly evolving consensus in Congress , and . throughout the nation , that some kind of Federal assistance was urgently needed to avert a fiscal collapse here  --  a municipal catastrophe that could have the most serious consequences for the entire country . The measure had been painstakingly drafted and redrafted to meet rigid conditions set forth by members of Congress and by various spokesmen for the Ford Administration . Its final version was co-authored by Representative James J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It involved not one cent of Federal expenditure . With Mr. Rhodes 's support , enforced by a flurry of White House hints that Presidential approval was imminent , Chairman Reuss was confident that he had the votes for early passage of the aid measure . That was at 11:59 . At 12:01 Mr. Reuss knew " we did n't have a chance . " He had received a " bombshell " from the White House advising him that the President would veto the bill which Mr. Ford dismissed as " irrelevant . " There is no rational explanation for that shattering rejection except 1976 Presidential politics . The ReussRhodes bill was highly relevant , meticulously tailored to meet a local crisis that Mr. Ford 's own economic advisers had finally concluded had become an urgent national . problem . ? ? By the President 's own admission , New York City and State had moved " impressively " to fulfill severe ? and , , ' in our view , some highly questionable  --  Administration conditions , including a legislated restructuring of debt and a plan for the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recess for the Thanksgiving holidays and with New York City within weeks , if not days , of default , the interests of the nation as well as the city clearly called for immediate Presidential action . The national interest did not prevail . It was not President Ford who responded , but Presidential candidate Ford who said " no , " guided by his own narrow political ? interests as perceived by muddle-headed partisan counselors in the White House  --  and in Albany . " Hang tough . " they advised him . " Hanging ' tough " on New York may pick up a few votes . Tr ! ' ' the fantasy world of Reagan country . But it wo n't solve ' the problems of ? the real world , of a deeply distressed urban America . It , is. time Mr. Ford remembered that he is not just another candidate for President ; he is the President , with a job to do for all Americans . He has miserably failed in that responsibility , and his failure will not be forgotten .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
