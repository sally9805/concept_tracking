CONSUMING PASSIONS by Philippa Pullar. 278 pages . Little , Brown . $7.95 . <P> <P> There are still those who believe a civilization travels on its stomach . Now they have their theorist , their Toynbee of the gourmets , in Philippa Pullar , a perfectly smashing English girl with a Cordon Bleu Certificate of Cookery and a graceful prose style . <P> In chronology and scope , Miss Pullar 's bibliography runs from Juvenal 's Satires to Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring . Tracing the vagaries of English appetite from the Roman occupation to the present , she has written a history of taste in the fullest sense of the word . <P> Straight off , the Romans illustrate one of Miss Pullar 's pet theses , which Americans , engulfed in cookbooks and cholesterol , might ponder : gluttony is the consequence of another sin , boredom - acedia . Affluent Roman days , according to Miss Pullar , were " great plains of monotony punctuated with affairs and mealtimes , " often conducted simultaneously . ( In a special appendix the twin hungers for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now at work on a biography of that priapic trencherman , Frank Harris . ) <P> The Romans may have been better engineers than cooks . They concocted trick buns that squirted , fitted wings to cooked hares in order to impersonate Pegasus , and rigged dining-room ceilings to rain flowers . Every meal a production number . But the recipes themselves , Miss Pullar maintains , have been underestimated by culinary historians . She favorably compares Roman sweet-and-sour contrasts with Chinese cooking , their well-sauced meats with Creole dishes . <P> When the Romans introduced their rich ways to England , the Britons scorned these foreigners " who bathe in warm water , eat artificial dainties . " This establishes a motif that runs through Miss Pullar 's history : puritans v. orgiasts . But gradually the natives came round . By the time those other invaders , the Vikings , had introduced their rollicking ways , canons had to be published forbidding drinking in church . <P> Still , Anglo-Saxon palates were hearty rather than decadent . Lots of meat broths and stews were the order of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on meat , making home-brewed ale equally obligatory . All lips smacked through the age of Chaucer . <P> What would have happened , Miss Pullar speculates , if the Puritans had not forbidden spices as exciters of passion , and generally brought to a crisis the English gourmet 's problem , which she defines as " the neurosis between the soul and the body " ? The English tradition , she thinks , " might have blossomed as richly as that of the French . " After Cromwell , mourns Miss Pullar , " nothing was ever quite the same again . " " Mighty Roast Beef " became the national dish . <P> For Miss Pullar , her history , and history in general , goes downhill after the Industrial Revolution . " Not since Imperial Rome can there have been so many signposts to gluttony , " J.B. Priestley wrote of the Edwardians . ( Edward VII 's breakfast : haddock , poached eggs , bacon , chicken and woodcock . ) Yet coexisting with gluttony , comparatively unimaginative gluttony , was malnutrition .
