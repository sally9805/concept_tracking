txt TEACHERS AT Chicago 's eight City Colleges will go on strike Monday morning , but Chancellor Oscar Shabat promised the schools will " open on schedule . " Last-minute contract talks broke of Sunday afternoon , the last day before the fall term was scheduled to begin . Norman G. Swenson , president of the Cook County College Teachers Union , said teachers will set up picket lines because " no progress " was made in three days of weekend negotiations on any of the union 's demands , including a 10 per cent across-the-board salary increase . IN SPITE of the planned strike , Shabat said later , " We will start the classes to the best of our ability on time at 8 a.m . Monday . " He would not elaborate on how this would be done , saying only that he wanted to " keep various options open " and the effectiveness of those options " depends on what happens in the morning . " The union has gone on strike four times since 1966 over contract disputes and once staged a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . The longest strike lasted five weeks , beginning in January , 1971 . " I 'm ABSOLUTELY sure the faculty will not go back to work no matter how long it the strike takes , " Swenson said . " Shabat is not negotiating in good faith , has n't budged in two weeks , and wants a strike . The board is attempting to use Gov . Walkers 's budget cuts as an excuse to throw us back into the stone age as far as a contract is concerned " Shabat countered that City College teachers have high salaries and low work loads that are " envied nationwide . " Shabat said Swenson 's allegations that " nothing new " was offered were untrue . The board Sunday offered 11 items which were either totally new or revised in favor of the teachers since the board 's last offer , he said . " Unfortunately , there is no more money to give , " he said . " WE PROBABLY GAVE away the money sooner than we should have , " he said . Now we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four budget cuts , there just is no more money left . When I personally entered the negotiations this weekend , I guess they thought they had a Santa Claus coming with a pouch full of money . " But I guess they hate me now because they found out my pouch was empty . " The City Colleges teachers have asked for restoration of all budget cuts im ? posed because of Walker 's reduction in state aid . Those cutbacks include raising the class size at the eight colleges , trimming teachers ' salaries for substitute teaching , adult education , summer classes and overtime work , and abolishing annual faculty longevity pay increases of $350 to $500 that had been given until the 17th year of service . THE UNION also has demanded regular contracts for some 100 teachers hired under five-month , self-terminating contracts last April ; restoration of a former department system and job security ; and contracts for teachers working in the Chicago Skill Center . The college board has maintained that it does not have the money in its $117.3 million budget for pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by $2.25 million from last year 's contract . The system 's 1,400 full-Hine faculty members currently earn an average salary of $18,000 , with new teachers earning $11,290 and full-time professors receiving $25,000 . MEANWHILE , Chicago Board of Education and Chicago Teachers Union negotiators are set to meet Monday in attempts to head off a strike by public school teachers Sept. 2 . Negotiations broke off Saturday after a six-hour session . The union has requested that newly appointed Public Schools Supt. Joseph P. Hannon meet with negotiators to help settle disputes over salary increases and class sizes . The union 's . House of Delegates voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to authorize a strike .
