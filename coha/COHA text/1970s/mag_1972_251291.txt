In more ways than the obvious visual ones , The New Yorker since its founding in 1925 has seemed almost immune to dramatic change . It has had only two editors in those 47 years , Harold Ross and the man who took over after Ross 's death in 1951 , William Shawn . The devotion to low-key fiction and gentlemanly criticism has persisted , as have the horse-racing column and such self-mocking images as Eustace Tilly and an imaginary correspondent called " The Long-Winded Lady . " <P> So would you believe that The New Yorker is today one of the most socially activist and politically polemical among major magazines ? That it vibrates in tones of tough liberalism and occasionally radical outrage ? <P> " The President , " said a recent editorial about busing , " seems determined to keep the people 's fear and hatred at the peak until election time , whatever the cost to the nation 's children and to its laws . " An editorial on the expanded bombing of Viet Nam : " The war that this country 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves us all in the dishonor of killing in a cause we are no longer willing to die for . " An article about the Nixon Administration 's record on civil liberties , by Richard Harris : " No one can say that the President has willfully set out to undermine the Constitution that he swore to uphold . But how would the results be different if he had ? " <P> " The New Yorker has always run articles about public issues , " Editor Shawn says ; the magazine can cite such warnings as Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring and James Baldwin 's The Fire Next Time ten years ago . But Shawn agrees that both the urgency and frequency of political pieces have increased sharply . In his view , the turning point was the 1970 Cambodian invasion . Richard Goodwin , once a Kennedy speechwriter , wrote a denunciation of Nixon 's " usurpation " of power ; Shawn used it as an editorial . After that " Notes and Comment , " once the fluffy lead-in to each issue , frequently became the magazine 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roughest weather The New Yorker had ever encountered in the narrow , sometimes viciously choppy New York publishing pond . Back in 1965 , New York had run Tom Wolfe 's satiric attack on Shawn and his magazine . Though shallow and unfair , Wolfe 's article generated talk and crystallized the notion that The New Yorker had become musty and irrelevant . Then , in the late ' 60s , like other magazines , it began experiencing a money crunch . It continued to be profitable , but income shrank dramatically. - <P> Outsiders naturally assumed that Shawn 's response to adversity was new politics for The New Yorker-an impression strengthened by an advertising campaign that emphasized the stinging prose . But Shawn and his staff insist that there was no connection . " Even when things were at their worst , " Shawn told TIME 'S Horace Judson recently , " I have never felt any pressure . I ca n't imagine what the pressure could have bee'n . I did hear murmurings in the background , people in the advertising community who thought we were too sedate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked . We always felt that we were in advance in what we said . "
