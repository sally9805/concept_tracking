The Post asked a number of experts , political figures , accountants and economists to comment on the tax system and to indicate ways to save you money . All politicians indicated the system was rank ( this is an election year ) , and agreeing or disagreeing , for purposes of filing in 1976 , we can only try to thrive on adversity , discovering  --  with the help of accountants consulted  --  ways to save money in the labyrinth . " Over and over again courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging one 's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible , " said the great Judge Learned Hand . " Everybody does so , rich or poor ; and all do right , for nobody owes any public duty to pay more tax than the law demands ; taxes are enforced exactions , not voluntary contributions . " Although the news seems to be full of millionaires who pay no income taxes , the Internal Revenue Service says that only six people who filed returns on an adjusted gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 . " I am trying to avoid payment of taxes this year by declaring New York City as a dependent . " Johnny Carson Henry W. Bloch , president of one of the largest income tax preparation services in the United States , says that contrary to popular opinion most loopholes are designed for the middle and lower income taxpayer , but that " people in higher income brackets spend more time , make a greater effort in the preparation of their tax forms than the average taxpayer . " All tax experts consulted agreed that itemizing deductions and maintaining records are the most important steps toward lowering the amount of income tax you must pay . " Your memorandum book should be as integral a part of your clothes as your wallet . You would n't go out of the house without your driver 's license ; you should n't budge without your memo pad . " Itemize all expenditures . Most household finance experts say that not only will you save on your taxes , but you will also develop economical habits . " We have a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the late Supreme Court Justice . " That a people so numerous , scattered and individualistic annually assesses itself with a tax liability is a reassuring sign of the stability and vitality of our system of self-government . " " Auditing keeps your neighbor honest , " says Henry W. Bloch . In the payment of income tax , you should make plans , long-range and short , as the year begins . Income tax is not exacted from the taxpayer on April 15 ; it is levied on him all year long . Project salary increases , cuts , bonuses , commissions . If you see a good year ahead ( say , your boss 's wife smiles at you at the company Christmas party ) , stay out of the higher tax bracket by taking losses in other areas  --  the sale of securities or real property whose current value is depressed . Chances are you can still buy the property back after at least a three-month waiting period after having taken the loss . Similarly , if you envision a poor year , use the lower bracket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your tax bracket . Experts recommend that you examine your tax category . Make sure you , your spouse and your dependents are in the most economical slot . Although generally it is better to file jointly , there are instances where it may put husband or wife into a higher income group . Sometimes it is better for the woman to be the head of the household if her income and deductions for that year exceed those of her husband . The head of the household does not have to be the same each year if separate returns are filed . If you are out of a job and looking for work , part of the search is deductible . Such expenses as your room , board and travel can be deducted . But not your wife 's if she accompanies you . Also , once you get the job , looking for a house is , within certain limits , a deductible item . All of this should of course be verified with receipts or canceled checks . If you are a farmer or businessman and have bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first year . This is limited to $2,000 if you bought it all in 1975 . But if you postponed the purchase of at least one-third of the equipment until the following year , you could take the extra deduction on this purchase , too . Charity begins at home . If you have no dependents , look into the preservation of a relative . Instead of giving your old clothes away to a casual charity , try the Salvation Army or an organized thrift shop . You may deduct the selling price of the clothes if you can prove what the items will be sold for . If you have real estate , stocks or bonds you wish to divest yourself of , look into the possibility of selling the property to your church or favorite private charity . In most cases the selling price will be less , but you will be able to deduct its full market value as a charitable contribution less the original cost . Also , if you have securities or real estate you paid more for than they are now selling for  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling for $300 ? you may give the stock to your church and deduct its full purchase price , i.e. , the $1,000 as a charitable deduction . If you work and must hire someone to take care of your children or other dependents , you can deduct expenses up to $400 a month . You may claim this whatever your sex or marital status . If your dependent is also incapable of taking care of himself , the care costs , such as a nurse 's wages , may qualify as medical expense . Interest payments on your house , sales , property , and state and city income taxes are deductible . It may pay you in some instances to keep a record of sales taxes , a tedious job but one that in certain instances saves money . If you are self-employed or the place where you work does not have a retirement program , the IRS permits you to develop your own . As of 1975 you may deposit and use as a deduction up to $1,500 or 15 percent of your income , whichever is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings and loan association or in an insurance program . If it is removed and you are not disabled or fifty-nine and a half years old , you must pay tax plus a 10 percent penalty tax to the government on the amount removed . The overwhelming majority of favorable exemptions in the U.S. tax structure are for businesses . If you do not now own a business , look into the possibility of creating one . Deductions are granted by the IRS for home offices , the use of automobiles for business purposes , membership in country clubs where the member can prove he uses the club for conduct of business affairs , union dues , and membership in civic clubs where the taxpayer can prove he is in effect advertising himself or his business in such disciplines as architecture , where advertising is not permitted by ethical codes . There are depreciation allowances  --  and bonus allowances  --  for the purchase and use of equipment including office furniture , typewriters , filing cabinets , calculators and computers . The business person may stagger the purchase prices of these articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small business you might investigate the advantages of incorporating . This is especially beneficial when the personal tax bracket exceeds 22 percent . This could vary , depending on the situation , from 0 to 48 percent . For example , a man 's business nets $50,000 annually . He uses half the income for personal living expenses and leaves the rest in the business to build up inventory . He has personal tax exemptions of $8,000 , leaving a taxable income of $42,000 on which he must pay around $14,000 . If he subtracts the $14,000 from the net income , and the $25,000 for personal living expenses , he has $11,000 left to reinvest in his business . If he incorporates , the figures would read this way . He pays himself a salary of $25,000 which is deductible as a business expense . The corporate tax due on the remaining $25,000 would be $5,500 . His personal exemptions of $8,000 would leave him a net taxable income of $17,000 , of which a personal tax of $3,540 would be due . The total tax , both corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . Subtracting his personal living expenses of $25,000 from this leaves him with $15,960 to reinvest in the business , a savings of almost $5,000 . When you entertain at home  --  or have overnight business visitors  --  keep strict records with a guest register . If the entertainment was directed toward securing a contract or making a sale , or even something as vague as gaining business goodwill , you may be able to take the deduction . Many large corporations have set up " cottages " for conferences on the grounds of the chief executive 's residence . A portion of the expenses for the entire place is thus deductible , according to the percentage of use which can be shown to be for business purposes . Business income can sometimes be divided among members of a family by means of a valid family partnership . The taxpayer must , however , prove that other family members besides himself contribute to the income and that he is not merely a donor . The Post asked a team of accountants to write up four hypothetical returns for four salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? none of which were required to pay any income tax . The man in the $10,000 bracket has availed himself of a " Tax-option " or Sub-chapter S corporation arrangement . This type of corporation allows its shareholders to assume the income tax  --  or in this case , the corporation 's loss  --  individually . Setting up a small corporation is not expensive . Lawyers ' fees and filing and charter costs may be as low as $200 . The Sub-chapter S corporation may not have more than eleven stockholders . For tax purposes it is essentially a proprietorship . Small grocery or furniture stores lend themselves to this type of incorporation . It goes without saying , the purpose of the corporation must be to make a profit . In all cases where deductions are taken , substance rather than intent must be proved for the IRS to allow the deduction . How It Began The present tax system has , since its inception in 1913 , become more than a tax system . Today it is used as a social instrument to control the birthrate ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to favor certain industries ; to control the environment . Personal income tax was first levied in the United States during the Civil War in 1862 . The tax remained in effect a decade . The minimum rate was 3 percent after a personal exemption of $600 and the maximum was 5 percent on incomes above $10,000 . Grover Cleveland , elected on a platform of financial reform , was instrumental in reenacting a personalincome tax , but the Supreme Court ruled that the income tax law was unconstitutional . In 1913 , the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified , and rates from 1 to 7 percent on $3,000 incomes and above were ratified by Congress . By the end of World War II , the minimum rate was 23 percent , the maximum 94 percent . Although it is difficult to compare rate structures in different countries , because of the difference in the first bracket rates , a rough equivalency in the highest possible tax brackets would be : the United Kingdom , 91.25 percent ; France , 65 percent ; West Germany , 53 percent ; and India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including relative financial stability , the United States rates highest except in the social services . The power to tax is also the power to create . Industries have grown up around the returning of taxes in the form of so-called " revenue sharing plans , " and a new branch of government has developed which is running neck and neck with the executive , legislative and judicial and will probably edge those archaic hierarchies by tax time next year . How much simpler it would be to merely tax less and save all that effort of returning these monies . Too simple . No one the Post asked to comment on the tax system had much good to say about it . In fact , no one has ever had anything good to say about it except that we do need a tax system if we are to have government services such as the collecting of income tax and the return of portions of the dry cleaned taxes to our cities . Political figures and economists who responded to our request for a capsule view on income taxes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demo-cratic Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter : Our tax system here in the United States is a disgrace to the human race . Our people are disgusted with it and I find little that s amusing to say about it . Alabama Governor George Wallace : The super-rich pay no taxes because of loopholes in the tax system . The only holes in the taxing system that the average man knows about are the holes in his paycheck where they take out more and more . In this country today the average paycheck of the working man and woman looks like it has been shot full of buckshot  --  if you go by all the taxes that they take out . And every time they put another hole in that average citizen 's paycheck they destroy a little more of the quality of life that he and hisfamily might enjoy . If we keep on with this regressive tax system that puts the heavy load on the average citizen we 're going to destroy the middle class who are the steel of all that is great in this country . Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax loophole " is someone else 's tax deduction . Many " loopholes " or deductions are in fact used by a majority of taxpayers . The federal income tax deduction for personal interest payments on home mortgages and consumer loans is a good example of what I mean . This deduction alone reduces tax receiptsby over $26 billion in a single year . Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire : The income tax laws are riddled with loopholes and truck holes . Almost every industry and every special interest has its pet provision . They are now so universal that if we were to start over , do away with all special provisions , and provide only a simple , progressive income tax , the present rates could be cut in half for all taxpayers without losing any revenue for the federal government . What we need is a tax law where citizens with equal incomes pay equal taxes . That is not now the case . Those who suffer most are the hard-working men and women whose income is earned from wages or salaries . They have few or no loopholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H &; R Block : Since 1913 , there have been constant changes in the tax laws like retreading an old tire over and over again . There ought to be a whole new tax law . Many people fear auditing . Audits are a great thing . They keep our neighbors honest . Only about 2 percent of returns filed are audited . Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy : To paraphrase a famous aphorism ( Anatole France ) , our tax laws in their majestic equality allow the poor as well as the rich to invest in state and local bonds , to reap long-term capital gains , and to search for oil . Walter W. Heller , Regents ' Professor of Economics , University of Minnesota : When it comes to tax reform , Congress seems to follow the G.K. Chesterton dictum that " anything worth doing is worth doing badly . " After a bold and brave start , the tax lobbyists work overtime to prove that one man 's tax loophole is another man 's Divine Right . Corrective legislation is peppered with exceptions and salted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of truth in one wag 's observation that " we do n't need tax reform  --  our tax laws are bad enough now . " But what may be a barrel of laughs for the high-bracket taxpayer as he tiptoes through the loopholes is a vale of tears for the working stiff who has no escape . Indeed , when billions of dollars are diverted via tax shelters for real estate , oil and gas , cattle growing , film and sport ventures , and all the rest , someone has to make up the difference . And that someone is the ordinary taxpayer . If Congress and the White House would join forces to end unwarranted tax preferences , the tax load on the mass of taxpayers could be correspondingly eased . And the cause of fairness and economic logic would be served . But alas , as Justice Frankfurter once put it , " taxation , like love , is not founded wholly on reason .
