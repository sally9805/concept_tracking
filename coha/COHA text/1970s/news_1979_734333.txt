txt The magnitude 5.9 earthquake that hit south of San Francisco Aug. 6 was a bonanza that has left geologists jubilantly pouring over a wealth of data . Happily for earthquake seismologists , the quake was along a section of the Calaveras Fault about 20 miles north of semi-rural Hollister where the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) has a dense array of instruments . USGS scientists now have a detailed record of what happened that isenabling them to check theories of earthquake behavior and refine esti ; mates of the kind and ' extent of damage that can be expected to occur with a quake of a given magnitude . In the opinion of USGS seismologist Roger Borcherdt , it also shows the value of maintaining dense instrumental arrays at sites where earthquakes can be expected . The Calaveras Fault is an offshoot of California 's famed San Andreas Fault , which marks the boundary between two of the large " plates " that make up Earth 's crust ? the plate that carries most of North America and the platecarrying much of the Pacific Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the slippage is not smooth nor is it uniform along the plates ' boundary ? that is , along the San Andreas Fault . Sections of the fault may lock , building up strain that then is released in a sudden jump , causing an earthquake . That is what happened Aug. 6 . The Hollister area is prone to this sort of thing . It is known to be an area of strain accumulation and has often been the scene of movements that have left their trace in the form of offset fences , // From page 1 Valuable data in wake of earthquake stream beds , and the like . This has made the area a prime site for earthquake research . This is why USGS geologists , although they had no foreknowledge of the Aug. 6 shock , were ready to make the most of it . At this writing , these geologists did not yet have many specific results to report . However , Dr. Borcherdt says that thanks to the network of special instruments capable of recording strong ground motion within 10 kilometers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of that motion . They measure this in terms of the accelerations that would be felt by buildings or other masses on the ground . The horizontal shaking was on the order of 4/lOths of the acceleration of gravity ( 0.4 gl . That is about what seismologists would expect for such a quake , Dr. Borcherdt said , but this was the first time anyone has been able to document that estimate . In terms of building safety , this shaking was about the strongest acceleration that many buildings are designed to withstand , even in earthquake conscious California . While that might seem to suggest that buildings should be made more quake resistant , Dr. Borcherdt says one can not call for building code revisions on the basis of this single experience . At the same time , it emphasizes the value of maintaining heavily instrumented research sites at strategic points in earthquake-prone regions . The payoff in valuable information is well worth the cost of the instrument arrays , in Dr. Borcherdt 's judgment , although he noted that this is only his personal opinion since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Hollister array has also enabled the USGS to study aftershocks of the earthquake . There have-been well over 300 of them , ranging in magnitude to 4.2 on the Richter scale . The main quake , at magnitude 5.9 , was the strongest felt in that area since 1911 . However , an active region like California is likely to have a magnitude 5.4 or 5.6 quake somewhere within it every year on the average , Dr. Borcherdt explained . This puts the Aug. 6 quake in perspective and suggests that seismologists would be likely to capture a number of these events if they had more such heavily instrumented sites at various points in the state . Dr. Borcherdt believes the Aug. 6 earthquake has been a seismologists ' boon , both as an illustration of the value of being prepared to take advantage of the state 's recurring minor quakes and as a reminder of the need to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible about the earthquake situation in California .               @ @ @ @ @ @
