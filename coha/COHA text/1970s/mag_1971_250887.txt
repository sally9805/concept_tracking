THE DAY OF THE JACKAL by Frederick Forsyth . 380 pages . Viking . $7.95 . <P> <P> John Wilkes Booth at least had the grace to shout " Sic semper tyrannis ! " Until lately , most political assassins have felt obliged to dress up their acts of public murder with some pretext of historic purpose . But the Jackal , an Englishman and pseudo gentleman , yearns for nothing more uplifting than the good life . When he gets an assignment from the OAS ( France 's antigovernment secret army of the early 1960s ) to do in Charles de Gaulle , he looks on it simply as a " once in a lifetime job . " If he brings it off , he will be able to retire for good . <P> The Jackal is an outsider , unknown to the French security forces eventually unleashed against him . He begins the assignment in the reading room of the British Museum , boning up on De Gaulle 's habits , and ends it-with a clutch of false papers and a hunting rifle disguised as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking a liberation day ceremony . <P> Author Forsyth seems less efficient . In chronicling the plots and ploys of the Jackal and his enemies , he produces far too many shifts of focus , step-by-step itineraries and logistical minutiae . He inventories the furnishings of De Gaulle 's office , and feels compelled to specify that the chauffeured , black Citron DS 19s circle the courtyard of the Elyse Palace counterclockwise . But on such things as how to steal a passport or select an assassination site , his expertise is extraordinarily compelling . <P> The author knows too that the most grueling suspense is generated not by mystery but by a long , slow wait for the inevitable . Partly for this reason , he seems about to make the kind of killing ( Book-of-the-Month Club , record paperback advance , vast movie contract , etc. ) that the Jackal hoped for from his far grimmer enterprise . <P> Forsyth may be in the vanguard of a rather queasy-making literary trend . Readers do , inevitably , identify with the assassin , and what he has , briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state . General de Gaulle is dead , of course . Earlier this year , though , Harper &; Row issued Who Killed Enoch Powell ? , a thriller-mystery predicated on the murder of a British Member of Parliament , notoriously disliked as a racist , but very much alive . What titles will come next ? Ho , Sweet Homicide ? Tell Them Willy Brandt Was Here ? Sunset on the Pedernales ?
