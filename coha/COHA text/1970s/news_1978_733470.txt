txt President Carter 's State ? of the Union message last week called for " fresh answers , , nnhindered by the stale prescriptions of . the past . " But his hydra-headed economic policy turns out to be , ' if anything , a tribute to the past . , The proposal for a 825-billion tax cut is vintage liscai policy , . designed to shore up the economy late this year bilt not to tackle inflation at the same time , as it might have . The pledge to shrink the size of the Federal Government and to chase the holy grail of the ? balanced budget is a hoary prciPositien . The stabs at . tax reform resemble those of his predecessors and are mere shadows of thesweeping , changes ' once promised .

Although the Administration issued ' a. blizzard of:documents over the weekend , its . game plan is still not clear . A new ? initiative to create jobs , for example , is no more than a.twinkle in Mr. Carter 's eye . By March , his advisers ' hope . to figure out how to spend $400 million to encourage business to hire jobless teen-agers and minority workers . The money is to be a subsidy for hiring the low-skilled , but the Government has not decided how to design or allocate such grants . The idea is good  --  bringing- some , balance to the President 's excessive reliance ' on artificial job . creation in the public sector .

' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern the nein , plan to enlist the help of business and labor in reducing inflation . To avoid the charge of interfering directly with wage and price decisions ; the President has fashioned what could become the Democrats ' own WIN button . ( President Ford got nothing but ridicule for his well-advertised campaign to Whip Inflation Now . ) The Carter plan appears to be equally toothless and jawboneless  --  without bite . It aims . to get business and labor voluntarily to hold wage and price increases in 1978 to less , than their . ? average increase over the last two years ..

Unless the President can demonstrate that his plan will.succeed , who could risk falling behind in the race ? Still the President 's advisers talk of avoiding confrontations .. They look to backroom huddles instead . The Council on Wage-Price Stability has conducted such huddles for years . They have produced a pile of exemplary analytical studies  --  and an unbudging 6 percent inflation rate . Without the power and prestige of Mr. Carter , publicly , as well as privately invested , the new anti-inflation effort will leave the same legacy . Unfortunately , the President has left himself without any other major weapon on this front . The battle against inflation this year takes on a new urgency , because 1978 is a relatively light year in the three-year cycle of union contract negotiations . Next year will be heavy , ' with pattern-setting contracts due in the trucking , rubber and auto industries . Unless the nation makes noticeable headway this year , there can be scant hope of turning down wage increases in 1979 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which neither Mr. Carter nor the Congress should be steering .
