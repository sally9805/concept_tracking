Owlish glasses magnify the seemingly perpetual expression of pained skepticism . The mouth is ever pursed in disapproval . The voice ranges in timbre from the crackle of dried twigs under a hostile foot to the rasp of fingernails across a blackboard . Along with these qualities Lawrence E. Spivak conveys the agility of a mongoose awaiting the right moment to strike a superior adversary and the assurance of a man who knows everything worth knowing about the topic at hand . This Sunday , when he clears his throat , adjusts the pillow seat that makes him look taller on camera , and thumbs the stack of index cards before him , Spivak and Meet the Press will be celebrating 25 years on television . At 72 , he is the longest-lived personality on network TV , a monument to durability in a field where ten or twelve years can be counted a full career . <P> Sealed Fate . From its tentative beginning in 1945 as a radio promotion for the old American Mercury magazine , then published and edited by Spivak , Meet the Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday broadcasts , quickly became a prime supplier of Monday morning headlines . Americans got their first official word of the Russian atomic bomb from an inadvertent remark made by General Walter Bedell Smith on a 1949 program . Thomas E. Dewey used the show in 1950 to eliminate himself from the presidential race and to tout Dwight Eisenhower as the 1952 Republican nominee . John F. Kennedy made his debut on MTP in 1951 as a young , relatively obscure Congressman . " We were looking for fresh faces , " Spivak recalls . " He was exactly right for the medium . " <P> The show 's early prominence came from Spivak 's uncanny knack for snaring newsmakers while they were hot , and from the tough questions he threw at them once they were on the air . An incident this summer suggests that Spivak has not lost his scheduling touch . During the Thomas Eagleton imbroglio , CBS 's Face the Nation seemed to have scored a clear scoop by presenting the beleaguered vice-presidential candidate and Jack Anderson , his chief tormentor , on the same program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman Jean Westwood and Deputy Chairman Basil Paterson , who said that " it would be a noble thing " for Eagleton to resign from the Democratic ticket . That not-at-all casual remark undermined Eagleton 's position and made his effort on Face the Nation irrelevant . <P> Spivak 's abrasive behavior toward guests has both pleased and enraged viewers . ( He once snapped at Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan : " Do n't filibuster ; we have only two minutes left . " ) Spivak denies any malevolence in his questions : " I never try to catch a man . I will never try to trick him . " But Spivak will hold a guest 's previous public statements against him if he seems to be waffling . " A man had better be prepared to justify or explain his changes of position , " he says . Such grilling can exhaust its targets . George Meany , no stranger to rough-and-tumble public debate , once grumped : " A half-hour on that show can age you ten years . " Spivak is also stern with the reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questioners must speak in turn on his cue ; Spivak hates " overtalk from all those eager beavers. "
