During his tenure as managing director of the Western American Bank in London , Joseph E. Baird has been , in the words of one high officer of an international corporation , " an innovator with a lot of nerve , " who made some investments and loans " that a conservative banker would not have got into . " He also made loans to Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles , and he caught the sharp eye of Occidental 's chairman , Armand Hammer . Still active at 75 , Hammer has announced that 39-year-old Baird will become the president , chief operating officer and No. 2 man in the company . <P> Occidental has since last year been making profits again after falling $67 million into the red in 1971 . But it has a long-term debt of close to $1 billion and thus has had some difficulty raising capital for Hammer 's favorite overseas projects , which include drilling in the North Sea and a multibillion-dollar plan to import natural gas from Siberia . Baird 's banking experience may be just what Occidental needs to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a better-balanced capital structure . " <P> A Yale graduate , Baird worked at Chase Manhattan and Smith Barney &; Co. , an investment banking firm . He became general manager of Western American in 1967 when it was formed by four banks , each representing a separate world market area , and soon built its assets from $8.4 million to $ 1.6 billion . If Baird can duplicate that remarkable financial performance at Occidental , he should become a prime candidate eventually to succeed Hammer . But for the present , as one financier close to Occidental puts it , Hammer " has n't the slightest intention of relinquishing control to Baird . He will rely on him as a good financial man , and that 's about it . "
