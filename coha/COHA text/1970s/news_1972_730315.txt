txt Goeran Gentele , director of the Metropolitan Opera , and two of his children were killed yesterday in an automobile crash on the Italian island of Sardinia in the Mediterranean . Mr. Gentele , 54 years old had succeeded Sir Rudolf Bing last month in one of the most important and challenging jobs in the music world . The two children were Beatrice , 15 years old , and Cecilia , 21 . They had been riding in the front scat with their father . Mr. Gentele 's wife , Marit , 46 years old , and her daughter by a previous marriage , Janette , 27 , who had been riding in the rear seat of the vehicle , were reported in satisfactory condition in a local hospital . The family had been vacationing since July 4 at the Ramazzino Hotel at the Porto Cervo resort developed by the Aga Khan . They had rented a car for the day to tour Sardinia 's northern coast . The police said the accident apparently had occurred when , Mr. Gentele , driving a Fiat 125 , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goeran Gentele high speed and crashed head-on into a cement truck . The accident site was a narrow road between Arzachena and Palay . Mr. Gentele 's last appearances in New York were at the recent Stravinsky Festival staged by the New York City Ballet . He was greatly enthusiastic about the festival and at one point said to friends : " This is what New York is all about . " Mayor Lindsay called the accident " a devastating tragedy , " and added : " Goeran Gentele was a great artist most certainly headed for further greatness . He loved New York . And he was a warm friend . Mrs. Lindsay and I are profoundly shocked . Mr. Gentele was scheduled to direct the Met 's opening night production of " Carmen " on Sept. 16 and had engaged Leonard Bernstein to conduct . Mr. Bernstein , reached at Tanglewood , in Massachusetts , said : " It 's impossible . What can one say ? He was so dear , so enthusiastic , so excited and exciting . I was so looking forward to working with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera Association , one of the first people to single out Mr. Gentele as a possible leader of the company , said that the new director had made it a point to talk to every member of the company , from stars to stagehands . " They had all come to love the man , " he said . Atmosphere or Anticipation When George S. Moore , president of the Metropolitan Opera , announced in December , 1970 , the appointment of Mr. Gentele as director of the Met for the 1972-73 season , he said : " Not only can he give us artistic leadership but he can make both ends meet . " No one will ever know if that prediction would have been fulfilled . But Mr. Gentele , even before his first season began , had made an auspicious start : he created an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation , even among this city 's sophisticated and cynical musical Establishment , and he successfully  --  and quietly  --  negotiated labor contracts with the Met 's 14 unions . The city , and the nation 's music lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen , " which Mr. Gentele substituted for a previously scheduled " TannUnser . " And the contract settlement with the musicians marked the first time in the company 's history that an agreement had been reached before the expiration date . When the contract with Local 802 was signed , a lawyer for the union said that Mr. Gentele had shown " extraordinary knowledge of both the held and of the country , to which he is new . " Mr. Gentele himself seemed to be bearing out a statement lie had made late in 1970 after his surprise appointment was announced . " I like fighting , " he said . " I do n't like a life of peace . " Made Sweeping Changes Just 19 months have passed since the slender , forthright Swede was named to the top post at the Metropolitan , and he took full control of the company only a few weeks ago . But in that time , he made sweeping and dramatic changes . He hired the company 's first black conductor , Henry Lewis , He planned a Piccolo Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first music director in the company 's history , 56-year-old Rafael Kubelik . He said he hoped to bring Ingmar Bergman to the company as a director , tha the planned to encourage informal attire ' at the opera and that one of his most important goals was to " Americanize " the venerable Metropolitan . " Why should it be , " he asked , " that so many United States singers must fly to the big opera houses of Europe while the singers of Europe are flying here ? " This was not a kind of newfound chauvinism . A more American Met , Mr. Gentele said , might persuade Congress that opera is a national responsibility . He made no secret of the fact that Government subsidy was one of his principal long-term aims , When Mr. Gentele 's selection was announced , the common response was " Goeran who ? " At the time , he was almost unknown in this country , even to opera professionals . But his background in opera and the theater in Sweden was extensive and his experience vast . Headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of Stockholm 's Royal Opera House , where he mounted 30 productions . In his earlier days , he directed about an equal number of plays for Stockholm 's Royal Dramatic Theater . But until his appointment to the Met , his only work outside Europe had been at Montreal 's Expo ' 67 , where his Stockholm company staged productions of " Tristan , " " Un Ballo in Maschera " and " The Rake 's Progress , " the last directed by his friend Ingmar Bergman , Claes-Goeran Herman Arvid , Gentele was born in Stock- ' holm on Sept. 20 , 1917 . He would have been 55 years old the day after his first pro- , duction at the Met . He was the youngest son of a Swedish army officer . His parents were divorced when he was an infant and his name , Gentele , was his mother 's maiden name , which she resumed at that time . Young Goeran was trained in violin and piano and started attending opera at the age of 8 . He served in the Army , studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political science , economics anti languages at the University of Stockholm , At that point , much to the dismay of his family , he decided on a career in the theater . After two tries , he was accepted at the Royal Dramatic Acting School in Stockholm and had been in some form of theatrical work ever since . Mr. Goeran 's career as an actor was short-lived , although it included both stage productions and films . He persuaded Pauline Brunius , the head of the Royal Dramatic Theater , to let him direct a thriller called " Crime in the Sun , " which turned out to be a hit , Thereafter , he spent less and less time acting and became an accomplished director . At one point , he recalled , he had four productions playing at the Royal Theater , two on the main stage and two on a smaller one . " Some of my colleagues were a bit jealous , " he said . One of the young actresses he directed was Marit Bergson , who became his wife on April 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working together , the Genteles produced seven feature films , all light comedies and all commercial successes in Sweden . Mr. Gentele 's opera career began the same year as his marriage , when k the Royal l , Opera asked him to direct a production of Gian Carlo Menotti 's " The Consul . " It was a great success , and a year later he joined the Royal Opera as a staff director . In collaboration with the conductor Sixten Ehrling , Mr. Gentele restaged " Madame But . terfly , " " Salome , " The Barber of Seville , " " Don Carlo , " and " La Boheme . " He offered modem works , including Alben Berg 's " Wozzek and KarlBirger Blomdahl 's " Aniara , " about passengers on a doomed spaceship . As a director , he worked hard with his singers , including the then little-known Birgit Nilsson , in a memorable production of " Salome . " " If Goeran had n't been so inspiring , " she said later , " I do n't think I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with me . " Perhaps the most famous Gentele production was his Swedish version of Verdi 's " Un Ballo in Maschera . " The opera 's story concerns the assassination of Gustavus III , the Swedish King who founded the Royal Opera , and who was shot in the opera house . Collaborating with the writer Erik Lindegren , Mr. Gentele produced a version that was considered historically accurate and that replaced the original libretto with 18th-century Swedish poetry . In 1963 , Mr. Gentele was named general manger of the Royal Opera replacing Set Svanholm , the heldentenor of a previous generation . During the next eight years , Mr. Gentele earned his credentials as an efficient and innovative administrator . The Royal Opera 's budget was only a third of the Met 's and most of it comes from government subsidies . Still , under Mr. Gentele , 380 performances were given every season , compared to about 275 for the Met . The Swedish company employs about 750 , the Met 1,000 . According to one report , Mr. Gentele was a candidate for the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center executive on a visit to Stockholm inquired if , when the time came for Mr. Bing to retire , Mr. Gentele might be interested . " Of course I would be interested , " he is reported to have said . " Very interested . " Over the next five years , the Genteles kept in frequent but discreet touch with the influential people at the Met , including Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3d , Mr. Wadmond , a member of the Met 's board , and Mr. Moore , then chairman of the association . The decision to hire him was made in November , 1970 , after the disastrous labor dispute of 1969 , which had delayed the opening of the season from September to Dec. 29 , and after Peter Mennin , president of the Juilliard School , had been offered the job and turned it down . Mr. Gentele came to New York for the announcement and quietly began imposing his own style and personality on the company , which for 22 years had been run by Rudolf Bing . In an interview a year ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a place where you should force people to do things , " he said . " It 's a question of creating a climate of enthusiasm , of having fun together , and of making people feel the excitement that comes when you create art . "
