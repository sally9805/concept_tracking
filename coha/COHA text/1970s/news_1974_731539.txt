txt TONY ENTERED his senior English class , shrank into his seat and said nothing . He caused no trouble , and he volunteered no answers . : Yet there was something astonishing about this quiet , ordinary 17-year-old . He could not read . After 11 years in the Chicago public school system , he could not even write down his ABCs . His teacher reviewed grammar , and she found that Tony could not sprit " noun . " The word " verb " he rendered as " wrb . " She gave him a simple line of poetry : " My love is like  --  a red , red rose . " He could . not read it . TONY IS NOT his real name , but he is a real 17-year-old . There are hundreds like him scattered thruout the Chicago school system . They are not freaks ; their IQs are not abnormally low . But somewhere along the line they missed a critical link in their education  --  they did not learn to read . They were pushed along thru the grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nightmarish factory . On a citywide average , nth graders are reading one year and two months behind their grade level . In some schools , the average is 3,4. years . And As beleaguered school board members and teachers struggle to settle teacher contracts and a myriad of other buroerotic details , little is said about the poor quality of education In Chicago 's elementary and high schools . Last spring . Tribune reporters James 0 . Jackson , Connie Lauerman , Anne Keegan , and Daniel Egler began an intensive investigation of the school syssome students , like Tony , can not read at all . Tony 's teacher at Fenger High tem . This is the first of their series al reports . School , 11220 S. Wallace St. , seethed as she talked . She said teachers know very well that many of their students can barely read , " but when you walk into the building  --  THIS building  --  you worry about other things . " WHEN IT IS so overcrowded that there is a continual din in the halls ; when you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are set every day in the bathrooms ; when posters are ripped off the wall and burned ; when kids are selling dope in the halls ; when teachers are assaulted ; when the kids drink beer on the corner  --  then it 's hard to worry just about reading skills that they never were taught . " If something is not done , we will have a nation of functional illiterates . " In dozens of schools across the , city , basic discipline is a formidable Problem . Some schools appear completely beyond the control of their faculties , . ? . and teachers frequently confess to ' being , . afraid of their pupils . In Orr High School , 730 N : Pulaski . ' ? Rd. , a Tribune reporter watched , i1illa : , . a teacher on hall duty ordered , ? a. stu ' ? dent to return to his unsupervised classroom . " Your teacher will be here in , a Ainute , " she said . The student responded with an scenity then said , ' ' You call him irteacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . TEACHERS AT Orr and at other schools said such incidents , and such language , were so common they usually went without notice . An Orr teacher , who asked that his name not be used , said the school was " a continuous riot frnm day to day . There 's grass . smoking in the johns , and drinking and loitering in the hang . You find wine bottles around , and teachers and aides are subjected to all sorts ? of obscenities and threats . " At Fenger , security chief Edward Kirby said he and his ' 11-member staff make an average of 25 arrests a month for such violations as assaults , fighting , and drug use . " We also have a lot of cases when kids drop matches in the Tribune Photo ey Odle Carter John Roberts , assistant principal at Fenger High School : " The school does not live In a vacuum .

" Kirby said he did not believe that marijuana was a serious problem , but students at the school disagreed . " TILE KIDS TURN on In class , " said Henry Viscouci , who graduated from Fenger in June . " They put the grass inside a lighter near the wick . Then they cup it around their mouths and light it and inhale . The room 'll be reeking with it , and all the teachers do is open the windows . The bathrooms reek with dope . The place is a dump . " Gambling is endemic . At Parker High School , 6800 S. Stewart A v . , card-playing  --  with money on the table ? is permitted in the lunchroom . At Fenger , Tribune reporters watched while three boys rolled a pair of dice against the school 's doorstep . Larry Jackson , a policeman who was assigned to Fenger , said he confiscated as many as six pairs of dice a day . Elementary schools suffer from the same problems as the high schools . Gompers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both during and after school hours . " Just look at these , " an engineer said , angrily displaying a stack of work orders . " Stage curtain torn to shreds , seats ripped up , 210 broken windows , holes in the walls . They tear the place to shreds , and it all happens during school hours . Somebody must see It happening , right ? How can a kid kick a hole in the wall without a teacher noticing ? " STREET GANGS trouble many elementary schools , and the mother of a boy at Morton Upper Grade Center , 931 N. Troy St. , said shakedowns are so common that her son was afraid to go to school . " When it was time to go , he 'd scream and cry , " she said . " That has a definite effect on education . How would you like to sit in class and worry about whether you 'd get home safely ? " The mother asked that her name not be used because she , too , feared retaliation from the gangs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorest areas necessarily where the most troubled schools could be found . Manierre Elementary , 1420 N. Hudson Av. , which serves Cabrini-Green , has become a model of good order and high morale under the leadership of Principal Alice Blair . Four years ago it was called the " snakepit . " At Spry Upper Grade Center , 2400 S. Marshall Blvd. , a rigid system of rules and punishment prevails . Boys and girls attend classes separately on different floors of the building . Teachers demand ? and get  --  order in the classrooms . " This place is run like a military school , " said general science teacher George Miszkewycz . " It 's very tough , very structured . " He said the assistant principal , Frank Modica , is the man who makes it work , and he said the school 's administration goes to any length to stop potential trouble before it starts . TILE TEACHERS at Spry were reluctant to speak of it , but one means of discipline is the paddle . Despite stern Board of Education rules against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licks " applied to the backsides of errant youths . Illiszkewycz says teachers are willing to take a chance on a lawsuit or dismissal in return for good order . Even in an atmosphere of discipline and good order , teachers struggle with Tonys and agonize about what to do with them . In their agonizing , nearly every teacher , administrator , and parent has firm opinions on what is wrong . Some blame overcrowding , others lack of money , others burocracy . They-say the fault is with lazy teachers , lazy parents , unions , poverty , gangs , dope , and each other . Some say it is sheer size . " There 's been a loss of intimacy , " said Rudolph Howard , former freshman counselor at Fenger High . " Living in the city . . . It 's a difficult place to bring up a child . School used to be the focal point of the community , but now we 've just gotten too big . " Howard will not fight the battle any longer . He resigned to return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHICAGO school system is almost too large for comprehension . It has a billion dollar budget , a half-million students , 50,000 employes , and 611 buildings . Each year , 3,000 new teachers must be hired ; each year , nearly one-third of all elementary school children change schools ; each year , $2 million must be spent to repair broken ? windows ; each year , 850 teachers report being physically assaulted ; every day , 50,000 students are ehsent ; every day , there is a shortage of at least 200 substitutes . The system , like the city , is undergoing a massive racial and cultural evolution , and educators said the schools only reflect their surroundings . " The school does not live in a vacuum , " said John Roberts , Fenger assistant principal . " The school lives as part of scciety , and has all the community 's and the society 's pluses and minuses . " Another principal , Anna Koiheim of Hyde Park High School , 6220 S. Stony Island Av. , said teachers must recognize that they are facing completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevancy and irrelevancy too much , but it 's true , " she said . " If you take your average inner-city kid and give him a story to read about grandma 's farm , it has no meaning .. . But give any high school kid ? an average student  --  a book on Hank Aaron and he 'll read it . " If he can . At . school after school , teachers told of their Tonys , children so handicap . ped by inability to read that they would be better off with no legs , or with atrophied hands . The man at the top , School Supt. James Redmond , said that the illness runs so deep in the society that the cure can only be long and slow . " We did n't get there in a generation , and it takes a generation or two to get back , " he said . " Public institutions do n't have the ability for quickness of response , " lie added . " Too many groups are involved in making a change . You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are too many people involvec to respond quickly . " THE PAINFUL slowness of changes in education could be illustrated by the policy called " Continuous Progress Mastery Learning . " It was begun in Chicago in 1963 , and Redmond said he has great confidence that it is a program that can bring profound improvement to education . Nevertheless , he conceded that after 11 years Continuous Progress has found only limited acceptance in the school system . The program calls for elimination of distinctions between grade levels  --  each student would learn at his own speed add - no longer be bumped up the ladder of numbered grades . The intent of the program is 0 prevent children from being shoved along thru the system without learning anything , and ft is cruelly paradoxical that it Vas ; ordered into effect In the ? yery. year Tony started in the 1st grade .

How could he make up 11 years in only eight months ? The teacher called Tony 's mother to school , and the bewildered woman dissolved in tears at the news her son WhS illiterate . She had never been told before . Tony flunked English last term , but the teachers in his other courses passed him even tho they knew he could not read . They felt it would worsen his life unnecessarily to deny him his diploma . He enrolled in English in summer school . When his teacher returned to school two weeks ago , his name was on the graduation list . Tony had won his diploma . The diploma is a proud document , with flowing script and old English letters . But Tony can not read it .
