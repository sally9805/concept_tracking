txt The snip-snippety-snip of the barber Shop is on the wane . The razor has come into its own ; the shears now play a very secondary role . At least that is the situation in those Darner shops that are making it ? out of the biggest recession to hit the barbering business since Oliver Cromwell 's Roundheads started the mass movement toward the short-back-andsides in the middle 1600 's . There are still those . who are putting the key into the door for the last time , adding their names to the long list of barbers who had to shut up shop as the longer and still longer-hair trend took away their regular customers . More than 45,000 barber shops have gone out of business in the past six years . But the tide is turning , says the trade . From Boston to Los Angeles business is looking up ; many barbers are taking home asatisfactory and at times substantial pay packet each week . The reasons : The ultra-long , ungroomed look in men 's hair is on the way out , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teen-ager is beginning to swap the down-to-the-shoulder look for the over-theears style . At the same time there 's still plenty of hair left on the average male head ? and it 's hair he wants styled . The ability to style , then , is what makes the difference . A Washington , D.C. , barber puts it like this : " I used to have a customer who came in every two weeks for a $2.50 clipper-and-comb job . Now he comes in once a month for the works ( shampoo , styling , a little tinting , and a manicure ) , and before he leaves he writes out a check for ; 25 . " That 's a 500 percent increase in takings from one customer , and it leaves the Washington barber with a smile all , over his face // *Barber-shop blues fading . ? ? // In fact all . accomplished stylists are smiling . Says Hunter Bell , elected men 's " hair stylist of the year " by the International Guest Artist Men 's Hair Stylist Association : " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've learned one thing : AU men want to look better if they can . " Hair styling , he contends , is becoming increasingly accepted as a way to " look better . " Mary Blythe of Tucson , Ariz. , agrees . She 's one of an increasing number of women barbers in the United States and a very successful one , too . She teaches her customers that hair should be long enough to enjoy but short enough to be functional . Apparently she 's getting the message across . Teen-agers , after watching the style-conscious , 20-to-30-year-olds leave her salon , are coming in with " whack-it-off " instrucExtra time  --  extra pay tions . " They want it just over the ears now , " she says . Boston barber John Mansour slaps $1.50 onto the charge for cutting extra-long hair . " They come in here , sit in the chair , and agonize for five minutes over whether they 'll go through with it or not , " he says . " I 've got to stand there wailing , so they pay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means increased income for Mr. Mansour . His prices start at $3 for the old-fashioned short cut through $7 to $10 for styling and on up to $20 for permanent waving . Bob Boteiho 's salon , like Mr. Mansour 's , is a two-chair shop . " Today folks like a more intimate setting , " he says , though some five and six-chair operations are returning in some of the larger cities . But , says Mr. Boteiho , the days of the big barber shops , like the 29 and 30-seat places of the 1930 's , are gone for good . They were mass-production operations that have no place in style-conscious barbering of today . " I worked in one of those places , " says Mr. Botelho in a manner suggesting it is a piece of his past he 's somewhat ashamed of . Tickets numbered " We used to give the customers numbered place tickets as they came in and whip them in and out of the chair in 15 minutes flat . The owner even used to beat out a steady rhythm. , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't like it if we went over that 15 minutes . It was assembly-line production . No one could style in a situation like that . " Meanwhile , there are still the doubting Thomases among barbers who ca n't believe customers would pay more than $3 for a haircut . There is a story in a recent issue of the magazine Journeyman Barber which tells of a hair stylist who went to work for a conventional barber . He brought his customers with him ( Mr. Boteiho , for instance , has some who come from 50 miles away ) , and charged them $7 . All the owner could say was : " I see it but I just do n't believe it ! " Three months later he was still seeing and disbelieving all at the same time . " It 's barbers like this who make an indifferent living or else go out of business altogether , " says Greg Croy , editor of the magazine . Standards rising Meanwhile , the barbering trade is reaching for the standards set by women 's hair- dressers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reached it yet , " says Gerald St. Onge , national president of the Associated Master Barbers and Beauticians of America . By that he means too few barbers are accomplished stylists . To this end courses in styling are being held regularly throughout the country . Any barber who wants to succeed " must attend these courses and regularly go back for refreshers , " says Mr. St. Onge . Barbers are paid by commission . They get 70 percent of their takings . Increasingly , now top stylists are taking in $500 a week . That means a pay packet of $350 . . Says one successful barber of the new trends in the trade : " Five years ago I would n't have wanted my son to follow me into barbering . Now I reckon he could n't find many better careers .
