txt There 's never been anything quite like it . One week from the convention , an incumbent president in the race , important issues involved ? and still two candidates almost neck and heck : Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan . All the excitement that did not happen at Madison Square Garden for the Democrats seems to be accumulating at Kansas City for the Republicans . Meanwhile the Democrats , almost in disbelief at their own harmony , pressed the advantage which the opinion polls presently set as high as 20 points above their rivals . Candidate Jimmy Carter was in Washington , Aug. 9 , addressing a public opinion forum . With problems of president , vice-president , and platform resolved for his party , Mr. Carter was in a position to attack opponents early and to expound positions . Speaking in New Hampshire , he promised to restore respect for the family ; he reassured businessmen in New York on economic issues ; and he aired his views on consumer problems in Washington to a group organized by Ralph Nader . But the big political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the growing possibility of a breathless , last-minute , hairline finish in which the outcome would turn on whether delegates voted according to their technical commitments or their personal inclinations . Here is the situation : ? The latest Associated Press poll stands 1,103 for Ford ; 1,035 for Reagan , with 121 uncommitted. ( 1,130 needed to nominate . ) ? Hard-line Republican regulars tend to - dominate GOP conventions as they did in 1964 when they nominated Barry Goldwater and booed Nelson Rockefeller . ? State primary laws which allocate delegates on a basis of proportional representation mean some delegates are pledged to one candidate though they may favor another . ? Court decisions , however , say that these commitments are not legally binding . The scene could be set for a theoretical last-*Please turn to Page 9 *GOP thriller nears climax // minute breakaway , depending on rulings from the chair ( Rep. John J. Rhodes of Arizona ) or preliminary test votes . The latter could create an atmosphere favorable to a particular candidate . It helped Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 Eisenhower-Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The highest art , apparently , is to arrange a strategic vote on which the uncommitted delegates ? or even delegates committed to another candidate ? will be compelled to vote their consciences in a direction favorable to a particular candidate , " a Brookings Institution report stated in 1960 ( " The Politics of National Party Conventions " ) . Such a situation now may be shaping in Kansas City . Delegates committed to President Ford  --  but privately favoring Mr. Reagan ? are suddenly called " Trojan horses " in the Kansas City atmosphere . Other political developments : ? Mr. Ford obliquely denounced abortion be- . fore 100,000 at the closing Roman Catholic eucharistic congress in Philadelphia Aug. 8 . ? Candidate Carter acknowledged that his campaign can not account for how it spent $150,000 of which , it is charged , $5,000 got to four black ministers in the Oakland , California area . ? The House took up postcard registration for federal elections , with the Democratic Congress favoring it ? but Mr. Ford likely to veto it .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
