The way the Boston Bruins figured it , they had no business being in New York . They should have won the Stanley Cup days before-on home ice before home-town fans-but the feisty New York Rangers had engineered a surprising upset . Embarrassed to have to hit the road again before they could wind up the playoffs , the Bruins wasted no time mauling the Rangers for their second National Hockey League championship in three years . <P> The brawling Bruins combined skill with scare tactics . Their dexterous centers controlled face-offs ; their defenders flung themselves purposefully in front of net-bound pucks ; their penalty killers not only frustrated good Ranger scoring chances but managed to score three times themselves . So much for their skating and stickhandling talents . Beyond that , the Bruins used shoulders , hips , elbows , knees and fists to intimidate the less aggressive Rangers . New York had finished second in the N.H.L. 's dominant eastern division , ten points behind Boston . The way the Rangers trounced Montreal and Chicago to gain the final round gave their fans hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 years . But against the Bruins , who had breezed through the regular season with only 13 losses in 78 games , the Rangers skated into a face-off with reality . <P> For most of every game , most of that reality was Bobby Orr . Soon after he broke into the National Hockey League in 1966 at the age of 18 , Orr began to build a reputation as the best defenseman ever to play the game-and probably the best all-round player as well . He may well be the most accomplished professional athlete currently active in any sport . Unassuming off the ice , Orr takes command when he is on it . And he often seems to be all over it . Sighs Ranger Coach Emile Francis : " Hell , I see him make a fantastic play on our goal , and when we skate back up the ice , he 's there to meet us . " <P> Orr played much of the Stanley Cup series with an injured left knee , but neither he nor the Rangers seemed to notice . On defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Rangers had a man advantage in the fourth game , Orr controlled the puck for 20 seconds , literally skating circles around the frustrated New York attackers . The New York fans , who lived up to their reputation by directing a steady stream of obscenities and litter at the Bruins , could think of no solution for Orr 's heroics other than to urge the Rangers to " Hit him , stupid ! " <P> On offense , Orr scored more points ( four goals , four assists ) than anyone else in the series . One of his goals-in the final game , which Boston won 3-0-was scored with one of his classically daring efforts . With Ranger Bruce MacGregor swooping in to steal the bouncing puck for a breakaway at the Ranger blue line , Orr could have played it safe by swatting the puck out of danger . Instead , he coolly trapped it inches from MacGregor 's stick , pirouetted on his left skate and snapped a 30-ft. wrist shot into the net . <P> To no one 's surprise , Orr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable player in the entire playoffs , an award he also won in 1970 . Earlier this year , at the end of the regular season , he was also named the league 's most valuable defenseman for the fifth consecutive year and the most valuable player for the third consecutive year .
