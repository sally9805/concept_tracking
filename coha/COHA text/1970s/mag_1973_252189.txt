<P> The ominous rumors had been circulating throughout Argentina : President Hctor Cmpora and his Cabinet would resign , and former Dictator Juan Pern would be in position to assume the presidency . At precisely 10:30 a.m. last Friday , the rumors became reality . Cmpora appeared on nationwide television and radio to announce " the mandate which General Pern gave us , we now return to him , because he is the leader of this great national , popular , Christian and revolutionary movement . " <P> Thus history in troubled Argentina came full circle . Less than a month after his return from 18 years of enforced exile abroad , the way had been prepared for Juan Domingo Pern officially to take total command in Argentina . <P> There were a few hitches , such as a new presidential election , which since Cmpora has resigned , must be called within 30 days . The interim President will be a Peronist , Ral Lastiri , head of the Chamber of Deputies . But there is little doubt that Pern will be elected the new President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cmpora , Pern 's hand-picked candidate in the March presidential elections . With Pern as the candidate , the Justicialists will certainly increase their margin of victory . <P> Cmpora fell from power after only 50 days in office , at least in part because of his inability to control Argentina 's spiraling urban violence . Cmpora had promised conditional amnesty to political prisoners , many of whom were confessed terrorists . He also heeded demands that all prisoners not only be granted amnesty but also be given full pardons . About 500 prisoners from ten prisons were subsequently released . <P> Soon Cmpora 's weakness returned to haunt him ; Argentina 's plague of kidnapings rose , as did the amount of ransom demanded . An even worse blow came last month when a bloody shoot-out between left-and right-wing Peronist factions left 34 dead and 342 wounded , ruining what was to have been a triumphant homecoming for Pern ( TIME , July 2 ) . <P> The mounting disaffection with the Cmpora government came to a head last week . Shouting " Power to Pern ! " Peronist workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cmpora and his Cabinet quit forthwith . Peronist congressmen likewise agitated for Cmpora 's ouster , as did moderate party members within the Justicialist movement . The only major opposition to Pern came from left-wing Peronist youth , who feared that a sudden change of heads of government would signal a shift to the right and thus scuttle their chance of turning Argentina toward Marxism . They denounced the " right-wing coup " and briefly occupied three colleges at Buenos Aires University .
