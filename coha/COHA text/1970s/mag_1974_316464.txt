ROAD MOVIE is a pitifully clumsy yarn about a couple of truckers ( Robert Drivas , Barry Bostwick ) , the hooker they pick up for relaxation ( Regina Baff ) , and the interstate agonies of owning a rig and trying to haul your freight to Chicago on time - before the gas crisis . Director Joseph Strick has made several other films ( The Balcony , Ulysses ) , although it is not apparent here . Road Movie is a shambling hour and a half padded out with highway footage photographed from the truck 's cab . The woman 's character is the most interesting in the film , though there is not much competition . She is a quivering little bundle of sadomasochism , helping the two drivers and destroying them at the same time . Unfortunately , Strick does not get around to concentrating on her or developing the character beyond a flat concept . He is content to let her quiver while he takes pictures of the honky-tonk at the side of the road .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
