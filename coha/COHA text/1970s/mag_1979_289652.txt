A MAN , A WOMAN AND A BANK Directed by Noel Black Screenplay by Raynold Gideon , Bruce A. Evans and Stuart Margolin <P> The movie convention that all intricate schemes to abscond with large sums of cash must be perpetrated by terribly nice and attractive people and against chilly , faceless institutions is an understandable one . After all , if we are to enjoy these tales we must , for the length of the film , set aside conventional morality to root for the criminals and against their victims . But in this film the crooks are so pleasant that they practically recede to ectoplasmic levels before our eyes , while the bank they set out to heist is so anonymous that it does not provide them with a properly menacing nemesis . The result is one of the least offensive but also least memorable crime movies of the year . <P> This is too bad , because the picture 's premise is not a bad one . It has the would-be robbers casing a bank that is still under construction and sneaking in to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can disarm it . <P> In due course , that is exactly what they do - and without any mishap to generate much suspense . Oh , there is this photographer ( the winsome Brooke Adams ) who mistakes one of the crooks for a construction worker and snaps his picture when , dressed like a foreman , he is making off with some blueprints he needs . But this character , played in more than usually laid-back style by Donald Sutherland , disarms whatever suspicions she may have by falling in love with her . Even when one of her pictures appears on a billboard on the bank , it does nothing to set back the robbers . <P> There is also some potential for suspense in a computer whiz , played by Paul Mazursky , who is better known as a director ( An Unmarried Woman ) . The genius ' wife is deserting him , he is a hypochondriac and chicken to boot . One imagines he might crack under the add ed strain of the caper , but he never does , and Mazursky 's portrayal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspense - and such full-throated comedy - as the picture offers derives mainly from Allan Magicovsky as Adams ' wildly jealous lover . He takes to following Sutherland around in a men acing way , and he might , in the process , discover just what game is afoot . But he does n't , and neither does a cop who stops the escaping Sutherland because the van carrying the swag to the airport has a malfunctioning taillight . Magicovsky was our last hope for some real excitement , but only modest suspense is generated by the encounter . Like everything else in this movie , it is underplayed and underwritten . Noel Black , who once did a curiously perverse little movie called Pretty Poison , is capable of stronger work , and so are these performers . Mere agreeability is just not enough to sustain a movie that has crime as well as comedy on its mind .
