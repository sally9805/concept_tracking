Patton advances a highly original thesis : the villain of World War II was not Germany , but Britain . The movie 's hero , General George S. Patton ( George C. Scott ) , is distantly analyzed by little Goethes in Nazi uniforms . They pronounce him " a magnificent anachronism " and America 's most fearsome belligerent . The British , on the other hand , are all whining limeys whose vindictive leader , Field Marshal Montgomery , nourishes his ego on the bones of American troops . One can imagine an equally distorted British interpretation mounting Monty as a knight-errant and Patton as a gorilla . <P> Patton opens with the general 's famous exhortation to the troops : " I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country . He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country . " Brimming with messianic zeal , the movie general struts about North Africa as if he imagined himself a Carthaginian commander . And that is precisely what the real Patton thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote odes to himself in his other lives . Today such attitudes in a draftee might bar him from service ; yesterday they served to propel a general to victories . <P> Obliging Windmill . Director Franklin Schaffner 's previous epic was Planet of the Apes . Patton sometimes seems a postscript , with wide-ranging battle scenes of tanks and air strikes that once again ravage the planet . The script presents Patton as a distorted Quixote , espousing an ancient creed : Hate thine enemy , and never let the home team down . In the end , what truly overtakes Patton is Patton . In a field hospital , the general strikes a battle-fatigued G.I. The shock waves of the slap reverberate back to America , where Congressmen shrill for the general 's command . Patton is relieved , and later placed under the authority of his onetime subordinate , Omar N. Bradley , played by Karl Maiden as if he were impersonating a potato . <P> The actual exploits of Patton in Europe are too outlandish to be fiction . He did indeed liberate 12,000 towns ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way . There is no ironist like history ; but the film makers will not let hell enough alone . After dodging bullets for three years , Patton was maimed in a peacetime automobile accident . The steel soldier died paralyzed from the neck down . But Patton leaves the general alive , walking across a wide field , wistful and quixotic . A windmill obligingly wheels in the foreground , lest the audience miss the intent . <P> Public Character . Patton views itself as " a salute to a rebel . " The line encapsulates the film 's faults . Patton was starved for the superpatriotic rations of the 19th century . It was not necessarily an ignoble hunger , but one can no more rebel backward than one can fall up . The movie 's vision blurs the man and , incidentally , the just war around him .
