The morning after , the early edition of the Milwaukee Sentinel was selling secondhand for $20 a copy , the Chicago Tribune was preparing an editorial reminding readers of its own DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN gaffe , two television networks were sharing their humiliation with an audience of millions , and Jimmy Carter had snatched a memorable psychological victory in the Wisconsin Democratic primary . All this because in their race to be first , ABC and NBC had declared Congressman Morris Udall an upset winner instead of what he was about to be , a game loser . <P> It began at 8:27 p.m . CST , just 27 minutes after the Wisconsin polls closed last Tuesday night . ABC 's Harry Reasoner interrupted The Rookies to say that Udall was headed for a surprising victory over Governor Carter . For a while , NBC held off . Then , at 9:22 p.m. , John Chancellor announced Udall would be the winner by " a modest margin . " That left CBS the lone TV network holdout . CBS steadfastly refused to concede anything except that the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became clear that Carter had eked out a victory and Walter Cronkite could crow , " Some other networks predicted that Udall would win and we did not predict that here . " <P> By then the damage was done . Following the two networks , half a dozen major newspapers , including the Washington Post , the Baltimore Sun , the New York Daily News and the Sentinel , went to press with early editions whose bold headlines proclaimed Udall the winner . Bolstered by optimistic projections from some of his staff , Udall gave a short victory speech ( " How sweet it is ! " ) to a throng of jubilant supporters-and headed off to bed . <P> Heavy Switch . Watching the early bad news up in his room at the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee , Carter turned to Barry Jagoda , a former CBS producer who coordinates coverage of the Carter campaign with the networks . " How often are they wrong ? " he asked . " Seldom , " Jagoda replied . " Well , I 'm satisfied , " said Carter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 've done well here . " Half an hour later , at 10:30 , he went down to the ballroom , addressed his disappointed backers and offered his " tentative congratulations " to Udall . <P> What went wrong at NBC and ABC ? <P> NBC Consultant Richard Scammon put the blame on " a heavier switch than we 'd anticipated in rural areas . " ABC 'S Walter Pfister shrugged it off as " a fluke , an anomaly . " All three networks base their projections on a model-precinct system . When the results of those precincts are analyzed , they are supposed to give an accurate projection for a state . But ABC and NBC , in their haste to post a winner , took a gamble when the race was too close to call . At the time ABC projected Udall , the News Election Service ( see following story ) , which supplies the networks with precinct tallies , had counted only 2% of the vote . <P> NBC was no better off , but for a different reason . It has had computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manual analysis of results . Man did no better than machine , though NBC is convinced it would have seen the closeness of the race had its computer been operational . CBS was saved by nothing more complicated than proper caution and a set of sample precincts that more accurately weighed the rural vote .
