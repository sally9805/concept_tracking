after a while . " Fact . He was brimming with constipation . But did they really want to hear about that ? He sensed it was up to him to keep the conversation going . Stranded between jollity and reverence , his friends hardly knew where to turn . " How 's Phil ? " he asked . They glanced at each other . " Do n't mention that guy , " said Bernie . " Please . " " What 's the matter ? Burning candles to Mussolini again ? " " Nothing . He 's just a rat , that 's all . " " Go on , he must have done something . " " Well . " They hesitated again . " Come on fellas , you do n't have to look at each other every time you talk . What 'd the wop do ?

It was strange , being talked about at all . Brian did n't realize he was an issue . " It was nice of you guys to stick up for me . You did stick up for me , did n't you ? " " Definitely . " " What 'd you say about me ? " " Well , you know , that you were a good guy and all . That you had a lot of guts . " They obviously resented being made to say it , and would think twice about sticking up for him next time . Saints do n't reach for compliments . He had certainly botched that one.  | " Yeah sure , I 'm a prince . What I really want to know is , what did Macaroni say that was so terrible ? " " He said that , you know , you were just a guy . " " Why , that 's a terrible thing to say . " " Well , it was the way he said it , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said we were just being nice to you because we were afraid of catching it ourselves . " Brian smiled . " That 's interesting . Is there any truth in it ? " The silence was horrible . They had come to worship at the shrine , and the old saint had pointed a bony finger at them and told them they stank on ice . No more pilgrimagesfor them , boy . He would have to look for new clients , new friends ; but right now he did n't care . After that , things degenerated , and out of sheer social inadequacy , Bernie landed a punch on Fatstuff 's biceps and the chase was on . Brian lay there , aware of his dead legs , thinking , Those guys are afraid of this , and I 've already been there . A grotesque sense of power creamed through his veins , right down to his toes . Yes , his crotch was alive all right . He saw their horseplay as fear and weakness , the high thin farting of virgins , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of his power  --  that polio was n't really that bad . Nurse Withers threw them out , and they said a worried but fervent goodbye . The young diplomat figured it this way . They were on record as thinking he was a great guy , magically improved by polio ; and they would stand on thep22record and try to forget what had happened in here today . The next encounter was a surprise . Phil Marconi himself ; a triumph . " What are you doing in here without a present , Phil ? Do n't you know that everyone brings me presents ? " " Yeah , I figured that . So I thought you would n't miss the one I did n't bring . " " You do n't understand , you fascist pig . It is n't the present , it 's the respect it shows . " You could n't accuse Phil of sneering , because his lips were shaped that way and he did n't have to move them . " How come all the presents go to you , anyway ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents to your friends , to keep things even . " " You came here just to tell me that ? " " Yeah , I thought this place might be ruining your character . Which was shaky to begin with . " Phil would be a great guy if he could ever stop saying the same one thing , over and over . Fifty-seven variations of " you 're not so hot . " " I hear you upset my friends , Phil . You told them I was just a guy . " " Nicest thing I ever said about you . Those little shits were sucking up to you for luck . Getting polio does n't change anything in my books . " Yeah , maybe not . Phil was so desperate to get everythingstraight , after the wartime propaganda , he neverp23knew when to stop . Brian was getting sick of the subject of polio , however cunningly served up . " Have I missed any triumphs of the Italian forces ? " he said . " Boy , you guys are boring . If the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he fights bad , you call him a clown . Italians do n't want this war and you should be grateful . " " Is it true they fought a draw with a flock of sheep ? " " You make me sick , Casey . When did you last hear from the Irish Army ? Fifteen-oh-two , in the Battle of the Bog , was it ? Unfortunately , the limeys routed them utterly . " It was good to shoot the crap like this . Marconi 's Irish accent had to be heard . " Den dere was de Battle of McGonnigle 's britches in 1603 , where alas de Irish was forced to flee , but switch to solemn Edward R. Murrow voice they got a great song out of it , which is still heard wherever free men gather . " Marconi laughed rackingly at his own invention . " Yessir , the strains of McGonnigle 's Britches ' were heard above the battle at O'Donegal 's Downfall and again the followingyear at O'Donovan 's Disaster . " " You 're full of shit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter would blow it apart . Miss Withers came in to check on the racket . Marconi 's laugh was a wheezing bark that could alarm anyone . He might be trying to kill someone in there . " See you , Brian , " he said abruptly and left , stumbling past Miss Withers.  |p24Marconi  was defiantly clumsy . He was the kind of guy who sneered at baseball and hit the ball a mile with a grudging , what's-it-to-you swing . In the movies he and Brian lived at , he would be the hero 's best friend , the one who chewed him out about his values the night of the championship . It was no accident  --  they studied those parts closely . Brian saw himself as a natural John Garfield . They rested him and fattened him up for the next round of visitors  --  his aunts , Brigid and Portia . There was no escapearound here , except to get so sick nobody could see you . He felt more than ever like a mummy in a glass case , as the aunts looked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected them to tell her something . Portia stared above his head as if nothing had happened . People were really a scream , in this situation . Aunt Portia had a leather shopping bag , Aunt Brigid 's was made of wool . Brigid hauled out a missal stuffed with holy cards . " This one is St. Jude , patron of lost causes  --  not that your cause is lost , by any means . And here is St. Dismas , the good thief . He 's always handy . I 'd like you to keep these , Brian . They 've done wonders in their time . " " And if you should want something a little more substantial , I 've brought you some medical magazines . " Aunt Portia sprayed her selection over Brian 's knees . They looked like the kind of two-bit sun-and-health nudist magazines that Brian and his friends occasionally browsed for cheesecake . " Do they say anything about polio ? " he asked . " Well , there 's one about a Dr. Steinmetz who does nervep25grafts . Here he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fuzzy picture of a small man in a two-piece bathing suit , standing next to a smiling brunette , twice his size . He had a chin beard , which looked hastily glued , and rimless glasses . The caption said the doctor was honeymooning in Atlantic City with his third wife , a former patient . Miss Olivia Schenk , if anyone wanted to know . " Dr. Steinmetz has had a terribly hard time from the medical world , " said Portia . " They hate new ideas , you know . " " Nerve grafts ? What 's that got to do with polio ? " Portia did n't blink . " I 'm not sure . The article is mostly about amputations , I believe . But do n't you think the same principles might apply ? " Maybe , maybe . His options were many at this point . Brigid surged back into the picture . " The nuns at St. Cecilia 's are praying their hearts out for you , Brian . And Father McShea mentions you in all his masses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark chapel . Just for him . Hot spit . " You wo n't be needing medical help in that case , " said Aunt Portia , who was something of a needler . Brigid laughed . She was a big woman , not easily rattled . She had fifteen or twenty children . Brian could n't rememberwhich . Altar boys with sniffles , flower girls : you only saw them in church . " God prefers to work in natural ways if he can , " she said . On another day , Portia would have given battle . " It 's the only way he ever works , have you noticed ? " Leaving the Church had been a convulsion forp26her , her moment of highest intensity , and she never missed a chance to rekindle it . " There 's no conflict between religion and science , " said Brigid , and Portia gave a hopeless snort . " We 'll both be working for Brian in our own ways , " said Brigid . Religion and science made sleepy , after-lunch peace in Brian 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured nuns praying in shifts around the clock , scorching their wimples , trying to shake a miracle loose ; while at the same time brilliant scientists worked feverishlyin mile-long labs , holding test tubes to the light and squinting . " Come here a minute , Watson . I think I 'm on to something . " Also quacks in bathing suits , mad enough to try anything , grafting the legs of a goat , the heart of a chicken . Something had to come of it all . Meanwhile Brigid and Portia fought with their eyes . Do n't destroy the boy 's faith . Well , do n't you fill him with superstition then . Or rather , " My life good , your life bad . " Brian had heard them at it , at family get-togethers , and did n't care . They were both right . Brigid had special powers . She breathed in time with the tides and had a baby every spring . She knew something . But Portia , his father 's older sister , was pretty smart in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Withers scooped up their cards and magazines and stuffed them in his bedsidedrawer . " Open the cage and let my crazy relatives out , " said Brian . " I 've seen worse , " said Miss Withers . She seemed annoyed at having to fix his flowers and tidy his presents . He could understand that . Her petulance wasp27comradely , us against them . " Those magazines are putting my aunt through college , " he said . Miss Withers held up his urine bottle and he nodded  --  a sordid exchange in most instances , but Miss Withers made a fine thing of it . " How 'd you make out last night ? " he asked her . " I do n't know . They 're all after the same thing , are n't they ? " She said it provocatively , a little gift for Brian . He thought about that thing they were after for a moment , golden and glowing . Then felt tired and dizzy . The packs sagged cold on his legs and Miss Withers began to cook up a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , peeped under the packs , and nodded . What did he see ? He asked Brian to flex his right knee . Brian could n't , but the doctor nodded again anyway . " How does it look , Doc ? " he asked . " Very good . No sign of atrophy , " said Dr. Samson . " Yeah , but is there any sign of life ? " The doctor smiled . " Do n't be in such a hurry . These things take time . " You see , you see ? He said I 'm going to get better . Brian was n't sure whether to press the inquiry and shoot for more specific assurance . O.K.  --  shoot . " What would you say the chances are , Doc ? " Samson looked at Nurse Withers , as if this were a routine they 'd done together before . " These kids , " he said . " Always trying to pin you down . " Miss Withers looked back without expression , bless her . The doc straightened up and swung into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you odds . People are working nightp28and day on this thing . And your own spirit could make a big difference . " Ten years in medical school to learn that ? Brian expected a better brand of cheese from this man . " What about Nurse Kenny ? " he said . " Yes , well , she 's done some very useful work . Mostly in cutting down atrophy . That 's about all she 's proved so far . " " What about Dr. Steinmetz then ? " " Dr. Who ? " Brian was embarrassed already . " Dr. Steinmetz . He does nerve grafts . " " Nerve grafts ? For polio ? " It did sound pretty silly . His aunt had led him into this . Samson did n't laugh , because he did n't have to . " I 'd rely on real scientists if I were you , Brian . " " I heard the medical profession was down on him . " " Is that so ? Well , I 'm not surprised . He probably should have his license revoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , and he could n't let it pass . " Men like that fatten on silly old ladies and make it that much harder for the rest of us . Do n't you think that if he had a cure for polio , we 'd know about it by now ? Do n't you think we 'd welcome it ? " The thought of Portia as a silly old lady was crushing . His own family did n't belong in those categories . Silly spinster , fat fool . Samson 's anger was so darn distinguished . " I 'm sorry , Brian , but those people give me a swift pain . Nurse Kenny , too , if it comes to that . Just another exhibitionist , raising false hopes in sick people . Put your faith in real doctors , Brian . And in your own fighting spirit . "  |p29The  doctor left , still smoothly raging . His neck was too thick for a doctor 's . Brian 's fighting spirit felt as hollow as Nurse Kenny . In defense of his stupid profession , Dr. Samson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighting spirit , indeed . If they were relying on that , the game was up . He gathered from Miss Withers 's expression that he must be showing some distress . " Do n't worry about him , he 's an old fud , " she said . But the rows of scientists were waxworks figures now , and the nuns at prayer were just silly old ladies , baying at the moon . " What about Dr. Steinmetz ? " he said ironically . She frowned and said , " Well , maybe he 's on to something . Dr. Samson would be the last to know . " Brian shut his eyes , too tired to feel seriously scared . There were some good things among Samson 's ravings , were n't there ? That you never could tell . That scientists were working . That these things take time . When he woke , he found he had regrouped and added Samson to the good tidings.  | " I say we tell him . " " Tell him what , dear ? " " The score , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't feed a boy of sixteen fairy tales . It 's bad for him in the long run . " " Oh dear , not that again . We 're not telling him fairy tales , " said Beatrice . " There are such things as miracles . You believe that , do n't you ? " They were in front of the window again . The back rooms were all as dark as underwater dungeons . So the Caseys met at the front window every evening . The trees in RiversidePark were beginning to shed , and the coming of winter had to be borne in mind . " Yes , I guess so . Occasionally . Not too many miracles in New York , though , " he muttered  | " There 's not too much faith in New York , either . Do you suppose that might account for it ? " They looked at each other fearfully , as if they had both felt the first drop of the monsoon . " Look , let 's not fight about it , " said Kevin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not fighting and personally I do n't care what you think about miracles , " said Beatrice , " though it seems a pity to have that emptiness in your life . " Kevin mumbled , more to himself than her , " I did n't say that they could n't happen . Just that they do n't . " " But I 'm afraid you 'll say something to Brian when he gets home , " continued Beatrice . He turned his head . Sick of memorizing the Jersey shore . Palisades Park was shut for the winter . The Crisco sign was out like a light . Everything dead or dying over there . Each time you have the same discussion , it gets a little bit worse . " I wo n't say anything at all to him until we 've talked it over together . Meanwhile , I plan to do everything I know to make him happy . O.K. ? " Kevin always liked to cut domesticquarrels short , before they got sloppy . But it was sometimes hard to do that and still make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend his days in the bright living room . From now on , they would have to do their arguing in whispers , and in the bedroom . So , if they wanted a last noisy one , this was the time for it . " I 'm sorry , " said Beatrice . " I know you want what 's best for him . " " I do , " said Kevin , reaching an arm for her shoulder . They stood for a moment side by side , as if there were an altar in front of them and a beaming priest . They hadp32weathered some standard-issue storms in eighteen years : miscarriages , hysterectomy , no more children . Nothing terrible recently . Not much more money of course , ambitionflogged slowly to death like most people 's . They could surely survive this one . " Look , I just want to ask this one thing , " he said . " We agree that Brian has got a fine spirit , right ? So  --  why do n't you think he can face the facts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why is it so important to you ? " She disengaged herself , and he began to prowl , to the sofa , back , anywhere . " I do n't know . " There was some other quarrel between them , but they could n't find it and had to keep settling for this one . " I do n't want my son living in an unreal world , that 's all . " " You do n't mean the Catholic Church , do you ? " " No , of course I do n't . The Catholic Church is realistic . " Kevin groped . The Church taught a little of everything , did n't they ? What was the teaching for this ? " They teach you to accept suffering , not to run away from it , and they teach , I think they teach , that it 's presumptuous to expect miracles . But besides all that  --  Do n't you see that accepting the facts could make a real man of him ? If we lie to him , if we offer him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like everyone else in this damned country . " " It just so happens his own faith is a very important factor . " There was a sense of scandal and shock between them . They had never really argued religion before . Kevin 's anti/clericalism was just a mannerism . They agreed about the essentials , because the essentials never came up . And Kevin 's good humor always suggested that he would be right about them if they did . " You and Father O'Monahan seem to think a healthy body is everything , " he said . " Damnit , if the spirit is so important , why do n't you concentrate on that for a while ? " " I do n't understand you , Kevin . Do n't you want your boy to be well ? " Oh God , the power of a non sequitur . " Of course I do . But what if he is n't ? " " Ile will be . I know he will be . " What monster of cold rationality could doubt it ? " If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be time enough to face it then . But how can you give up on him so soon ? " Lack of faith was a terrible accusation . It was better to be wrong than to be a doubter , a life-denier . He tried to rephrase it . " All right . I believe it . I believe that he very probably will get well . I do n't see what we 've ever done to rate a miracle , but maybe we 'll land one anyway . More likely it will be science that does it . " " That 's perfectly fine with me . " " But , anyway , I do n't know  --  " silk cords of custom kept them from fighting properly and ending it . He was n't allowed to say , You ca n't face it yourself , can you ? You 're more Hollywood than you thought , are n't you ? And she was n't allowed to say back , what she must be thinking , You 're being very brave on your son 's behalf , I must say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could youp34take it now ? It was as if the sick boy were in the next room already and they must talk in flurried whispers . At their last anniversary , Kevin had toasted the happiest couple he knew and the man who made it possible . Now , one badly phrased word could release old poisons they had n't known about . They groped for that word and pulled away from it . To stall , Kevin gave her a good-old-boy squeeze and she responded slightly like a faithful chum . The next day , Kevin Casey dropped by the hospital to assist at Brian 's removal . It was a cold , raw day , a coldbloodedkiller to all that grew , but Brian thought the fresh air was simply great as they slammed open the iron door and hoisted him down the ramp and into the ambulance . " I do n't know when I 've felt so great , " he said . " Just feel that air , will you . " Kevin 's bones had long since turned to stone , but he did as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son 's elation . What could he do for this wonderful boy ? Brian was talking thirteen to the dozen in the ambulance . His face must be the only one in town to have escaped the first frost . Outside people with grey faces peered in whenever the driver stopped for a red light ( the ambulance was in no hurry ) and it seemed as if their skin would fall off with the next wind and have to be raked away . Or line the gutters like rind . Legs or no legs , his son was at least alive . Brian talked of the wonders of home , what he would do first , second , who he would like to see ( not see ) , and thep35Grade A spookiness of hospital life . Miss Withers , he said , had broken with her creep and taken up with another equally creepy . She was plagued by sex fiends . The night nurse was hoping to get back to Russia and rejoin her " people " as soon as the war ended , and had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , and she could now say words like " drop dead " and " so 's your old man , " with that sad , faraway smile of hers . " It sounds as if you had a pretty good time after all , " said Kevin . " Yeah , except for things like the early-morning washing . I told you about that , did n't I ? The night nurse likes to give you a last lick before she checks out . And then the morning nurse wakes you again for a quick scrub  --  mind you , you 're still wet from the night nurse . " He was more talkative than he used to be , almost like an actor . " And then there 's **26;14895;TOOLONG . You know , after the first week , you do n't really have a temperature to take any more , but boy , try telling that to the nurses . The trainees come sneakingin with their thermometers and whammo , in the mouth , under the arm , anyplace they feel like . Wow . " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a smoothness about him , and the rattling charm of a salesman . Had he been listening to too many daytime radio shows ? Or was this the tinny echo of somebody'sbedside manner ? Kevin hated blather ; Brian sensed this , and slowed down a little . " It 's funny about the temperaturepart , " he said . " You know , polio only lasts about a week . What you have after that is the remains of polio . "  |p36Perha|ps  it was possible to become both glibber and more thoughtful . Anyway , the synthetic thing , the prattle , would become worse if the boy was lied to about his condition . ( Why is this such a mania of yours , Kevin ? Because I cannotbear to deceive him . Because he 'll find out and say " You deceived me . " Because I can not bear it that I know and he not . Because . A good confession is never done . ) That morning , before picking Brian up , Kevin had talked with Dr. Samson , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , squirting smoke screens of " wait and see 's " and " early to tell 's , " but when he saw that Kevin would settle only for the worst , he said , " Unless science comes up with something , I guess his chances are only fair . " God , he hated people like Samson . There was a sense of no Irish need apply about him . And of " Fordham ? ( pause ) I see . " " Less than fifty-fifty ? " Kevin badgered . " Much less than fifty-fifty ? " Let 's have a little mental discipline , Yale . The doctor nodded . " There should be some sign of life by now , Mr. Casey . The arms seem to be all right , especially the right one . He nearly broke my hand testing his grip . The neck and stomach are weak but hopeful . " And then he launched into a stream of Latin names , glibius flatulus , ponderus maximus , not Latin a Catholic would use , indicating that Brian 's legs were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wanted to hear ? Pain was ambiguous , some people laughed from it . Kevin was delirious , flayed alive , laughing to death , but glad to know . Nothing couldp37now get worse , that was the important thing . Jerk the adhesiveoff smartly . Brian could still live a wonderful life , but they must get started on it right away . No more prayers to St. Philomena . " I would n't tell your wife about this , " said Dr. Samson . " What about my son ? " " Why tell him ? He 'll get used to his condition in a year or two , and he wo n't mind knowing then . " If Samson had his way , no one would ever be told anything . Everyone would pass through life knowing nothing at all , caressed by lies . His only medicine was anesthesia . " You do n't trust my son , is that it ? " Kevin said as pleasantlyas possible . " You do n't think he 's strong enough for the truth ? " " Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what ? Sixteen ? Precocious in some ways . But do n't be misledby that . It will take all the courage he has , to face it when he has to . " Please , Doctor , spare us your wisdom , O.K. ? You have utterly failed to help us professionally . In fact , you have done nothing at all , so far as I can see . So do not lecture us on how to live ... Kevin felt for a mad moment that the doctor was to blame for the whole thing : his sly evasions , his passivity had held Brian in check for precious weeks . Samson looked as if he was used to this . He came around the desk and stood by Kevin , ready to shake hands or whateverKevin preferred . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Casey . It 's hard for you too , I realize that . It 's your decision , of course . But I think Brian will figure it out at his own speed . The factsp38are there . " Translated : everybody really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Dr. Samson , have not deceived the public . A weaselly compromise . Dr. Samson was paid by the minute , and his handshake was metered . Kevin was uncomfortable with professional men . Of course he was one himself , but he did n't feel like one . He left the doctor 's office and had a couple of drinks for lunch to steady himself . It was indeed his decision to make . The truth hurt like hell , he could hardly bear to keep his own eye on it for more than a second . But two years of ghastly charade and dwindling hope were unthinkable . You would n't string out , say , an amputee for two years , would you ? All right then . Whether Beatrice liked it or not , he would share the truth with his son and join him in battle . The truth could make Brian a hero : how many people ever get close to the truth ? With only one son , you wanted to go all the way . It was n't enough just to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little Scotch , as he joggled in the ambulance . But now Brian had lengthened his view from the first days at home and was burbling about the months ahead . " Basketball , yah , who cares about basketball ? I 'm not tall enough anyway . The doctor says I 'll never make seven feet . I expect to be out and around by then , of course , but it 'll take awhile to get my legs back in shape . You can definitelyput me down for the opening of the baseball season . " My God , he was talking like a child . The baseball season ! Kevin jerked his head , but there was no place else to lookp39in the narrow ambulance . Brian must have thought his old man was nuts , like all the others : trying to hide his fixed grin and his streaming eyes.  |p40So  Kevin gave up , for now , the ideaof telling Brian his chances . He still thought he should , but he had n't the heart to . As the only one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he carried an unfair burden . He watched with heavy eyes the pantomime of cheerfulness and unreality forming around Brian : the holy-card vendors setting up their stands , Portia and her crazy magazines , the quacks with their optimism , ten dollars an ounce . He ached to scourge them away , and have everything very pure and simple , but he could n't bring himself to do it . And every day he felt weaker and more out of it . Brian did n't spot much of this . His father seemed his old brisk self  --  altogether too brisk in some ways . For instance ,  |p41he  brought up the question of schoolwork on Brian 's secondday home . " Ca n't that wait a little ? " said Beatrice . Exactly Brian 's feeling about it . " It 's possible to get lazy in bed , " said Kevin . No , no . Polio victims are a compendium of all the virtues . Brian knew his old man had a point , but felt nettled with him for bringing it up at this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and to have to study as well . What Brian wanted now was magazinesubscriptions . He proposed to his mother that they put out for Look , Collier 's , Time , and The Sporting News , a nicely balanced lineup . Kevin said , " You wo n't have time for anything else . " " Nobody in the world has more time than I have , " said Brian . They compromised on Time and Look . The days were pleasant enough , except for the grunt and groan with the physiotherapist . Mrs. Schmidt demanded an hour 's work and a pound of flesh , and a ten o'clock scholar . " You 're not pushing , " she 'd say . " How can you tell ? I do n't have any strength there yet . " " I can tell . " She pumped his legs , as if she were training him for the Rockettes . When he did n't push , she noticed it , and when he did push , she accused him of doing it with his hip , a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Schmidt . " When am I going to get better ? " he asked from time to time . " Never , if you do n't push . " " Yeah , but if I push ? " " Just keep pushing . "  |p42That  was all the sense he could get out of her . But she was a good kid . She lit on a flickering muscle as if it were a gold strike . " Do that again . " He usually could n't . " I thought I saw something . All right , let 's get back to work . " She would never give up on any leg that came her way . But after a month or so , she began to allow herself a fiveminutecigarette break . And it turned out she was quite different at rest . Her face smoothed out and she looked beautiful , for forty-two . She talked about music a lot , althoughBrian told her he had a tin ear . Never mind , he should hear about music anyway . It was part of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Fraid not . He spoke French then , yes ? Sorry . Ach , you Americans . One thing she would n't talk about under any-circumstances was the war . It seemed she was some kind of refugee with a husband still over there . But whether this husband was in a concentration camp or the German High Command , there was no way of telling . Brian could n't tell a Jew from anyone else , even though he 'd lived in New York all his life . He did n't think he 'd met any , although Levine might be one . They had him in a cranked-up bed , and he sat by the window watching the grim last of the touch-football games and the appearance of mittens and sleds . There was no place for real sleighing down there , but they paddled along hopefully until they came to a rise . They were smaller than they used to be . Enthroned in clean pajamas in the middle of the living room , he came in for a good deal of random attention .

After which , they would forget him and talk businessand politics , so that he went from being petted to beingbored . The way it goes . He read a lot , mostly junk , but some good stuff . Damon Runyon , Chesterton , Plato 's Republic . Decided Socratic questions were a crock : " Oh yes , Socrates , truly , Socrates ; how do you want your ass kissed today , Socrates ? " Still , he liked the book . Father O'Monahancame around and gave him the sacraments at Christmas . Very embarrassing to confess masturbation to a man who could actually see you , but there was no way round it . O'Monahan took it like a sport . A man came over to cut his hair , and a fine mess that was , trying to tilt his head around on the pillow . His neck was still weak as water and they talked about putting it in a brace  --  scare talk that came to nothing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought to you on trays . Even the men 's room was brought to you . He was embarrassed the first time his father took out the steaming bedpan . It was things like that which made him ache to get back on his feet . Otherwise , it was a pretty good life , at least in the daytime . People seemed to think he was going through something , and if he said he was n't , their eyes glowed double with admiration . The nights were kind of crumby . He prayed a lot ( 1 ) to get better and ( z ) to avoid the roaring temptations of the flesh . He did n't sleep well , for want of exercise , and he usually succumbed to number 2 around three in thep44morning , in agonies of remorse . Please do n't hold this against me , Lord . I still want to get cured and will make this up to you eventually . No one in good health should ever have occasion to masturbate . Linking the problems like that gave him an exhilarating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet pajamas . In February a little man came around with a roll of brown paper and began tracing his legs . It had n't been explained to Brian , or he had n't been listening , that he was about to be measured for leg braces . A disgusting idea . " What do I want those things for ? " he bellowed at Mrs. Schmidt . " I 'm going to walk on my own legs . " " Ja , but in the meantime . . . You do n't want to spend all your life in this room , do you ? " It felt like a betrayal . His muscles would never come back in those iron grilles . He had seen people heaving along Broadway , dragging them like chains . In fact he even remembered throwing a pitying smile to one such  --  old fellow with a beard and a shiny black suit . God , what a horrible thing to do . " You did n't even ask if I wanted them , " he raged . " How can you make decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian . It 's routine . " " Do my parents know about this ? Get my mother . " Mrs. Schmidt was not someone you ordered about , but this time she went meekly enough and came back with Beatrice . " What is it , Brian ? " He wanted his anger to hit her , level and hard . " Did you know about this , Mother ? Did you know that Mrs. Schmidtp45was planning to put me in braces ? " The little man shoved a second piece of paper under Brian 's other leg and began sketching . He either was deaf or had heard it all before . " My God , not my right leg too . Mrs. Schmidt ! You said my right leg was improving . Mother , did you know about this ? " Brian had not yelled at his mother since he was five , and he half-expected her to slap him sober , especially for saying " my God . " But to his surprise , he got away with it . She bowed her head and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was a normal part of your treatment . " " Oh , she did , eh ? You thought that putting my legs in iron braces was going to bring them back to life , is that what you thought ? " His mother was crying , and he felt a queasy mixture of contempt and confusion . " My God , Mother , why did n't you tell me about it ? That 's all I ask . I do n't want things done to me ... " " I 'm sorry , " said Beatrice . She shook her head and then half-ran from the room . Did I do that ? thought Brian . The cause and effect were of different sizes . It was weird the way the cheerfulness around him would spring these suddencracks : his mother crying , his father making faces in the ambulance . " This has nothing to do with whether you get cured or not , " said Mrs. Schmidt coolly . " Your physiotherapy will continue as before . It is a healthy sign of progress that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts into tears , that will be the day . The little man rolled up his papers and left . Brian tried to stay angry over the deception . He still thought he wasp46going to get it in the neck from someone for shouting at his mother , and he wanted to maintain some righteous indignationfor his defense . But when he next saw his mother , she was still very gentle and repentant . And when his fathergot home , Brian heard them murmuring in the hall , and then his father was very gentle , too . The braces arrived , gaunt steel scaffoldings smothered in straps , and he was jimmied into them and strapped tight and hoisted aloft , like a knight helpless in his armor . It was a giddy feeling , lurching about at this altitude , with his feet trailing off in the distance . He jerked a leg in a memory of walking , and only Mrs. Schmidt , a former circus strong man , it turned out , kept him from crashing to the floor . His knees hurled themselves against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . He was scared spitlessthat he would just fall apart if he tried to move again . Straw would fly out of his chest . But Mrs. Schmidt was everywhere , under his armpits , around his chest , doing it all . She urged him forward in a stately waddle in strides of no more than six inches , all the way to the window . He felt giddy with achievement . It was a clear , sharp day , you would know it was New York blindfold . But looking at it standing up  --  now there was something . He rested his head lightly against the glass , savoring his sheer tallness . He had no idea how high five foot ten was . If somebody comes , in now and talks about my gallant struggle , I can at least grab him and fall on top of him . Bite his leg , if necessary . Oh boy . He felt drunk up here and half-mad with power.  | " Are you ready to walk back now ? " asked Mrs. Schmidt . " Try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much drag , please . Keep the toes pointed . " She was at it already , before he had even had his measure of gloating . What differencedid it make which way his toes pointed ? He 'd be out of these things in a twinkling . However , something warned him not to raise the question right now . She would only say , " You 'll never get better if you do n't point the toes . " As she commenced her endless unstrapping , he thought , She 's right , this is n't much of a triumph . He thought again of the old men heaving along Broadway , some of them not really old at all but solemn little boys in glasses : they had probably had their moments of glory like this , the first day up . It was no time to get complacent . The braces looked malignant when they were off : like something in an AmsterdamAvenue store window , between the pink trusses and the corrective corset . Dwarfs humping in to be measuredfor dwarf equipment . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you did n't pay too much for them , " he told his parents over supper . " Because I do n't intend to stick around in them for long . " He knew that this proclamation came under the heading of gallant struggle and fighting spirit , but for once it could n't be helped . He had to put his intentions on the record . His mother said , " Of course you wo n't . " And his father said , rather blankly , " We did n't pay too much . " And then recovered himself to say , " Not that that makes any difference . "  |p48Fatstuff  and Levine looked in occasionally , but they seemed more at a loss than ever with their bedside manner , now that Brian was only half-sick . They clunked in and out of the kitchen for something to do , polishing off his Pepsi ration . Otherwisethey sat around and picked at their socks . Brian brought up his plans for the coming baseball season and the guys seemed slightly incredulous . " You really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Levine . " Definitely . " " That 's great , Brian . " No use talking to them about it . He did n't give a shit what they expected . He would just have to show them , just as he would have to show his old man . He had asked the latter for a baseball glove for his birthday in February , andp49his father had agreed with that worried look of his and had given him something else . All right . We 'll just see . Also , some new friends would n't be a bad idea . He sensed that the old ones were coming around now out of remembered kindness , and he sure as hell did n't need that . Polio had lost its terrors for them , he would have to get cancer to see that again . " You remind me of a couple of old ladies from the parish going door to door with a bag of fruit , " he told them one day . They grinned sickly and did n't answer . Hey  --  he might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg at them and sang , " It could happen to you . " Phil Marconi was still O.K. , if you liked that kind of thing . He came by himself and talked about socialism , his new kick . Solitude was driving Marconi insane . " What do you do for girls up here ? " Bernie Levine asked one time . " I have them flown in . From Paris . " " No , but really . " Really , what he did over them was writhe , twist , and sweat , holding his penis to keep it from exploding . Outside of that , nothing . " What happened to Marie Snyder ? " said Bernie . " She sent me a get-well card . It made me cry . " " You want to meet something good ? " " Now tell me , Levine . In your frank opinion , what the hell would I do with something good up here ? " " You could talk . " " Yeah . Thanks mucho , buddy . " In fact , all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necking as could even now be easily performed in a wheelchair . But he understood that Bernie at least had moved on from that , which elevated the rhetoric for all of them . He temporized . " I 'll be getting around pretty soon . I 'll wait . " Outside of the feeling that he was now an enormous cock with a six-inch man attached to it , he was in no special rush . Three days a week now , a man called Mezzerow came around and coached him in various subjects  --  algebra , English , and whatever came up . Mezzerow was some kind of a nut , if you like . He had shiny , thin black hair and a red beard , and Brian never did place his accent . " It does n't matter , " said Mr. Mezzerow . ( " Probably Armenian in that case , " said Kevin . ) He taught at Fordham , which Brian had always taken to be a jockstrap institution . But Mezzerowwent to a different , exotic Fordham . " There are many strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't teach Brian a damn thing he was supposed to . Although he described a huge , rich syllabus to Kevin , he never got close to it with Brian . Before his corduroys had crunched down , he was off on a discussion of , oh , medieval monasteries , or whether men were inherently different from women . One day it was genes , the next it was the socialcontract . His little eyes would dart like a bird 's and he would light on a fresh subject . Pick , pick at it , until he 'd got hold of a thread . Then up and away.  |p51Brian  loved the sessions and hoped that nobody else would discover that his teacher was crazy . He got especiallyhooked on Roman history  --  his own temperament seemed suited to the years 133  --  44 B.C. He thought Sulla was kind of like Roosevelt . " No , no  --  he 's like your General MacArthur . " Mr. Mezzerow would leave with his green algebra book under his arm , convinced that he had been teaching from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the algebra coming ? " and Brian would say , " Fine , fine . " He even tried to learn a little on his own , to cover for Mr. Mezzerow . The one thing Brian did learn was how to argue with a bird in flight . The opening would be pedantic , a discussion of ground rules . " What do you make of theocracy , Casey ? Do n't you think that priests make more disinterested rulers than lay politicians ? " Brian could have been anybody at that point . Besides wearing the same shirt for a whole week , Mezzerow took no interest in individuals as such . " That 's ridiculous . I mean , is n't it ? " And they 'd be off , Brian pouncing and the little man skimming away over the grass , into the trees . " Do you believe in theocracy ? " Brian would say , winded and exhausted . " I do n't know . " Mezzerow 's eyes would suddenly look troubled . " Sometimes I think it 's better than what we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never knew what Mezzerow had seen in his lifetime because the little fellow was unmasked all too soon . Brian had to be shown a real algebra exam , to see how he would do in the Regents , and he could n't make head or tail of it.  |p52Mezzerow  had a confrontation with Kevin . " Do you know any algebra yourself , Mr. Mezzerow ? " Kevin shook with rage . Brian hoped to God that Mezzerow knew a little . Mezzerow walked over to Brian and said , " You know how to do this , do n't you ? " He took the paper and wrote the answers on an envelope without pausing and handed them to Kevin . He had taught Brian how to do this , he knew he had . Kevin thanked him speechlessly , and he left and never came back . Later Brian heard that he was releasedby Fordham ( which Brian now pictured as a refugeecamp , with gypsies boiling kettles and singing ) and had disappeared into the Midwest . Along with Mrs. Schmidt , he conveyed the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you someday in a cheap hotel room or in back of the " Y. " He was replaced by a poopy regular teacher named Waltonand the old dullness settled in . Brian was used by now to reading what he liked when he liked and this man 's assignments simply bored him out of his bedpan . For a while he did them in a rush at the last minute , and then he stopped doing them altogether . How do you like those apples , Mr. Whatzit ? Mr. Walton , who , mind you , was so dull that Brian could n't remember what he looked like betweenvisits , shrugged . How do you punish a boy who alreadyhas polio ? Brian had been raised thus far in the Catholic school system and was used to working under the whip . This guy was a pussycat . Walton was replaced  --  tutorswere nomads , always moving to a new mining town  --  by a Miss Crowther , who was just ridiculous . She looked asp53if she was going to cry as she snuffled out her sixth-grade arithmetic . Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York after that . It did n't matter , Brian had been top of his class at Conception ( God knows , a humble achievement ) , and he could spot the guys a year . In April , Mrs. Schmidt thought she sighted something in the left anterior tibia or someplace . Push , you buggers . Sorry . False alarm . Next they installed a galvanic battery to smoke out any live nerves that might be lurking in there , burned only burned his skin and left it sore as a boil . Mrs. Schmidt said she was pleased with his right leg , which was O.K. as far as it went but not the big cigar . " You should concentrate on that one for a while , Brian , " she said . " Yeah , well , you see . I know that one 's going to be all right . It 's lefty I 'm interested in right now . " " Pardon me . You do n't know that the right one 's going to be all right . You do n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop instantly . " Ja , ja . Vurk is der answer to der problems . " Look , Mrs. Schmidt , lefty is the ballgame , as far as I 'm concerned . " Orders came straight back from the Reichstag . " It is imperativethat you have one good leg as soon as possible . " Done and done . " You mean you 're not sure the other one 's coming back at all ? " he said playfully , not meaning any harm . It was just an average day . " You can do wonders with one good leg . It 's like night and day , the difference . "  |p54Ho  hum . What was that she said ? One good leg ? What the hell use was one good leg ? " You 're kidding , Mrs. Schmidt . You think I 'd settle for that ? " he said , smiling . " What you settle for is your business , " said Mrs. Schmidt . " I 'm just telling you  --  " She stopped . Physiotherapy conversation was mostly prattle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle , and you sometimes launched into a sentence without planning its future . " What are you just telling me ? " " I do n't know what I 'm telling you . I 'm telling you you have to work on your right leg , that 's all . " She began ferociouslypumping his left leg , as if to appease it . He watched her with panicky disdain . Unfortunately , he could not afford to let this pass . " You 've lost faith in me , have n't you , Mrs. Schmidt ? You do n't think I can do it ? " " I did n't say that , " she muttered . " Come on , I 'm not that stupid . One good leg , you said . Admit it . " She worked away fiendishly as if she would cure it all by herself this very afternoon . Her silence was maddening ; he must make the next words land a bit harder ; he must force her to say that everything was going to be all right . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faith in me . Are you listening , Mrs. Schmidt ? " She looked up from her hopeless task . She looked as beautiful as she did off duty . " What do you want me to do , Brian ? " " I want you to say you believe in a complete cure . And ifp55you do n't , I want to get someone who does . " He had n't meant to force her hand . In a way , it was only words anyhow . Like the Pledge of Allegiance . Go on now , just say it . " Do you really mean that , Brian ? " " Yes , I do . " You can keep your fingers crossed if you like , he almost added . She took a deep breath . Oh God , you do n't have to take a deep breath for this . " In that case , maybe somebody else would be better for you . I 'll talk to your mother . " And she picked up her stuff , just like that , and was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard her voice out in the hall and was tempted to shout something . He was losing everybody . He must keep Mrs. Schmidt at all costs . But then he thought about the one good leg , and how Mrs. Schmidt had probably given up on life as such for some personal reason , a dead child or something , a murdered husband , and he thought , I ca n't have people like that around me . It would deaden his willpower . She was some kind of Jewish refugee , he bet , beaten way down . This was one of those turning points ( he had n't expected one today ) where you decided to become a cripple or not . He must toughen his mind starting now , and have no truck with losers . Final snapshots of Mrs. Schmidt : walking the streets in her belted raincoat , boiling a rationed egg in her lonely apartment , finally being gunned down in an empty swimmingpool by the S.S. Brian told his parents that he liked her very much , and always would , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father looked depressed andp56did n't say anything . " Do n't you agree , Father ? " Kevin murmuredsomething . " I said , do n't you agree ? " " Of course we do , " said Beatrice . Mrs. Schmidt 's replacement was no defeatist , but a serene old lady with iron fingers , name of Miss Seton . Miss Seton did not know much of the mechanics of polio , but she did believe you could do anything if you tried . She herself had recovered from some disease which Brian had never even heard of , while she was still a small girl . She had also met Owen Wister , the author of The Virginian . A delightful man . Brian knew he would feel those fingers drumming on his legs as long as he lived . " Miss Seton thinks there 's life in your left leg , " said Kevin . " Yeah , well you see that comes mostly from the hip . " Kevin looked inexplicably proud  --  another of those outof-synchexpressions . " I 'm glad you admit that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " " Listen , I 'm not that far gone , that I need to kid myself . " Miss Seton did n't know many exercises . She had never actually handled a polio case before , though she had some acquaintance with arthritis , and her only notion was to knead him with baby oil and pound him until the blood roared . Any sign of life anywhere fooled her , and on lazy days , Brian liked to thrill her with fake heaves from the torso . The old lady was beside herself every time . He was beginning to lose his faith in orthodox physiotherapy anyway , it seemed like an awfully plodding way to get there . What this thing called for was a blitzkrieg , with Generalp57Patton streaking through the Ardennes , General Bradley reaming in from the South  --  those slashing arrows in the paper every day should be applied to his spine . So , re-enter the swamis . Aunt Portia was still peddling Dr. Steinmetz , who had turned up again in Arizona . His new clinic had been doing famously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent move in the A.M.A. plot to discredit him . Portia was trying to get in touch with Steinmetz , and if he ever came East , she would make sure he got a look at Brian . Aunt Brigid , for her part , was high on one Blessed HerbertWeatherby , who needed one more miracle to move up to saint . " Of course it would have to be authenticated , but you would n't have any trouble with that , would you ? You could get a doctor to sign something , could n't you ? " " Yeah , if anyone could read the doctor 's writing . I 'd certainly hate for Blessed Whatzit to waste a miracle . " Steinmetz countered with a daring new plan involving leeches . These , if applied to the jugular vein , would suck off all the poisons in the system , and then some . Unfortunately , Steinmetz was having trouble taking his beasts across state lines , and had been arrested in Kansas when one of them escaped from a shoe box . Blessed Herbert Weatherby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to his very existence . His name had originally been scratched in the Tower of London , and his initials had become an inspiration to Catholic fugitives everywhere . But whether he had actually existed was not known for sure.  |p58In  a final raising of stakes , Portia began talking of taking Brian out to Kansas to see Steinmetz , while Brigid spoke of Lourdes , now that the war was ending . Kansas was dismissedfor now on the grounds that Steinmetz would probably be somewhere else when they got there , but Lourdes seeped into the regular family consultations . " I think it 's a wonderful idea , " said Beatrice . " Do n't you , dear ? " His father 's new mumble was the answer to that . His mother agreed to accept it , though Brian was nettled by it . " Maybe by next spring it 'll be possible to get over there , " she continued . " Next spring ? I 'll surely be better before next spring . " Brian 's litany . " You 'll have to get me there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Is n't there a shrine in Canada or someplace ? " asked Kevin , joking thinly . " Lourdes is an awfully long way away . " " You know there 's only one Lourdes , dear . Even pagan scientists are stumped by it . " " I guess so . " " If we can just get Brian there , our worries are practicallyover . " It was only true , if everybody said it together . " Do n't you agree , Father ? Our troubles are practically over ? " Kevin looked strangulated . " Yes , I guess so . " " You do n't seem very happy about it . Does he , Mother ? " They both smiled at Kevin , a spontaneous ganging-up by the Faithful.  | " I do n't think you should take miracles for granted , " Kevin said in a low voice . " Do n't worry , I wo n't . " His father looked so small and weak , Brian felt he could say anything to him now . " But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , Mother ? " Kevin looked at his wife . She was still smiling . She was on Brian 's side . Faith was vitality , doubt was death . Corneredlike a rat , Kevin said , " Beatrice , I think you 're spoilinghim , " and left the table . They dropped it , of course . The Caseys in quorum never discussed personal matters for more than a minute . But Brian heard them at it again later , like distant thunder , in their room . They must have calibrated the house , to see exactly how loud they could speak without quite being understood . It was maddening , straining from his bed , to catch it  --  another three feet would have done it for sure . But with the sixth sense of the bed-bound , the one that picks up doctors ' evil whispers , he imagined his mother was saying , " How can you talk about spoiled , after all he 's been through ? " And he thought , I have n't been through anythingyet , have I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , at that.  |p606  By March , they had him up and out in a wheelchair . The second time , Bernie Levine almost cracked up the chair , racing it down the hill on Claremont . Brian was shaken by the four-miles-per-hour , the giddy rush of air on his indoor face , and screamed for him to stop . After that , they took him on a sedate grand tour and he thought , Oh gee , you do n't have to be that careful . They plodded gently past Riverside Church . " Could you go a little faster , Fatman ? Good grief , but you 're in terrible shape . " Hennessy plugged along gamely , not yet realizing that you can say " fuck off " to a polio victim . On Brian 's side , it was difficult making jokes with a guy who treated you like a piece of glass . " O.K. , Fatstuff , take five , I was only kidding . " Gee , but his friends were second-rate.  |p61Im|portant  lesson about human nature : they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Fatstuff was involved in the Glee Club , anyhow , and spent long afternoonspracticing " Stout-hearted Men " for Commencement Day . Levine was rushing some girl in Westchester . Fuck spring , thought Brian , who swore liberally in his head these days . He missed his ration of raunchy conversation and did n't want his thoughts to get too soft and girlish . Faithful Phil Marconi pushed him around the block once and quit for good . " It 's too much like work , " he said . Brian 's picture of Phil as loyal , cynical friend had to be adjusted downward . " I can get you a guy from Chinatown for six yen an hour and no questions , " said Phil . So it usually ended up with his parents pushing . It seemed a bit of a chore after that , like walking the dog , and he wished they 'd change the buildings around here . He went at a crawl , with a blanket over his knees , and got annoyed with people who looked at him and asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked an old lady , who seemed startled . Half an hour a day , he lunged around the apartment on his braces . Miss Seton let his toes point where they would , and he found he could work up a good , ungainly speed , slurring his feet across the living-room carpet . In due time , he took the elevator , to the cheers of the doormen , and held a small parade in front of the house . Neighbors and well-wishers gathered to cheer him on , with cries of " take it easy " and " that 's the boy " and lots of vague gurgle and buzz . He felt like the Second Coming . Flushed from the attention , Brian said , " That 's only thep62beginning , folks . " And damned if someone did n't praise his fine spirit . Ah well , tolerance , tolerance . His arms were limp as rags from pushing the crutches , and he felt like a marathon winner as he slumped back into the house . He had a picture of those admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would see them again in dreams , in Roman togas , or bobby sox , his basic crowd face from now on . That very night , he played basketball in a jammed arena , floating around the court like thistledown , making miraculous lay-ups between motionless opponents , and the crowd was there . When he woke , he could not believe it had been a dream . He made the first moves of getting up as usual , slipping his legs over the side of the bed . He had felt them move just a few minutes ago , their strength had returned during11 , the night . All was well . Ah goddamnit . You ca n't sneak up on it like that . His feet touched the floor , and he knew that they were the same old feet . He hoisted them up again sulkily . The dream was a dirty trick . He ran the dregs of it around his mouth . Dreams had taste , all right . The funny thing was , he 'd been floating with a slight limp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Kevin said he 'd had a bad day and he certainly looked it . His face was still steaming from the heat and he could n't seem to get his collar loose enough . Had he always looked like this ? Anyway , it was imperative that Brian take some of the management of his own case away from this very tired man . " I dreamed I was playing basketball last night . All right ,  |p63it  's nothing to get excited about . " God , he hated sentimentality . " But it made me want to get things moving . I mean , are we just going to sit here and wait for something to happen or what ? " " Miss Seton is very satisfied with your progress . " Kevin had poured himself a huge drink , and seemed overwhelmedby it . " Yeah , Miss Seton . I 've taught her all I could about polio , but she does n't seem to catch on . " " Do you want another physiotherapist ? " " No , I really do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't Help it with exercise , right ? " " Right , I guess . " His father looked as if he just wanted to go to sleep . He finally said , " What do you suggest then ? " " I do n't know . How about that place I keep reading about , in the South . That must be pretty good , I bet . " " It must be pretty expensive . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " " I do n't know , " his father continued . " I may not have enough money for it . " " Could n't you do some extra work or something ? " Kevin began to speak and then changed his mind . God , he 's drunk . That 's what it is . He must have gotten stoned on the way home . Brian was disgusted . His father suddenlyseemed terribly drunk , awash , rheumy-eyed , with booze rubbed right into his suit . He was falling apart under their eyes , just when they needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Brian . " It 's been an expensive year , " mumbled Kevin . Beatrice ,  |p64who  had been darning socks at the window , glared up at this . " Polio 's an expensive business , " he said . Beatrice would not argue in front of Brian , but she left the room pointedly , and Brian assumed that they would argue later . " I 'm sorry I 'm a burden on you , " he said sarcastically . " Oh God , I did n't mean that . " The old fool was on the verge of tears . " It 's just been a very tough year . " Well , his sickness had clarified a few things around here . Brian had always felt the neutral , equal love for both parents that Catholic boys were taught to feel . " Felt " was even putting it too strongly . Now he saw that if he was to make the Big Push , he could not afford to love his father equally . Not until he got back on the team  --  Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you equally . But his father seemed paralyzed now , in the soul . Counting his pennies , with a cure in sight . " I 'll write to them myself , " Brian said . " Maybe they have scholarships or something . " " That 's all right , I 'll write to them . " " Do n't you know somebody influential who might help ? " " I 'll have to think about it , " said Kevin . Think about it . Oh God , that was too much . Too priceless . Brian turned away and rolled his own chair silently out of the room , leaving his father staring into his glass . Kevin did raise the money somehow , and he even came up with an influential person , sort of : a school friend who knew the head of the Polio Foundation . And they found ap65place for Brian in the overflowing hospital at Salt Rock . Brian practiced turns and fast stops in the living room to prepare himself for train travel , landing hard on the carpet a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at Penn Station , drunk not drunk , who could tell any more . He was off the team now . Brian took all the credit for being here . For three weeks he more or less had n't talked to his father , and Kevin had submitted to the silence . That was all : Brian had willed this thing into happening . " Goodbye , then , " a worried face at the window , and gone . His father was only one of a hundred small anxious people disappearing up the platform . Most lives were terribly insignificant , from a moving train . A fight to the death with polio gave your life some point . Those people on the platform hit him like a vision . He had n't moved fast for so long he 'd forgotten how peopleshrink as you travel away from them , how they melted into each other , cloth and flesh all in one , and became the public , humanity , and then nothing at all . A harassed porter checked on Brian every hour or so to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , things were pretty frantic . Sailors went heaving past with their duffel bags or hunkered down on them , to jam the aisles . An enlisted man plopped next to Brian and fell instantlyasleep . The conductor tried to wake him to see if he had a Pullman ticket . The soldier said , " Wha ' wha ' , " and rolled his head away . It was pretty neat , to Brian 's eye , after seven months of nothing much . The conductor asked a sailor to help with his ticket problem , and thep66sailor professionally raised the sleeper 's eyelid and pronouncedhim next door to dead . " Probably on drugs , " he said . " You did n't know that , did you , conductor ? A lot of civilians do n't . Yeah , all combat soldiers are doped to the gills , the poor bastards . " The conductor edged off to find an MP . The sleeping man waved a finger at him . Everyone was very nice to Brian . Some of them called him " sonny " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepingman asked if he 'd been in the army . " Watch out , " said Brian suddenly . The MP had snuck up on them . The man 's eyes shut and his head lolled expertly . The MP gave him a shake and then tried to lift him by the armpit . The sleeper collapsed in the MP 's arms , causing him to stagger like someone in a dance marathon . Then realizing that the jig was up , the sleeper gave a woozy salute and they moved off together . " Did you see that guy 's combat ribbons ? " said the sailor . " Shit , he should be allowed to sit anywhere he likes . " When Brian had to go to the john , they passed him from hand to hand like a fire bucket : scary at first , on the rolling train , then exhilarating , being touched by so many friendly people . Swaying over the toilet bowl , fumbling at his buttons , he felt like giving a war whoop . It was like coming back from the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't sleep . It was raw excitement , no cause , no nice thing he had to tell himself , but the rush of a train through black country , the feeling he was moving again . He jerked up the shade and smiled out at the moonlit fields . Gr  --  eat !  |p67The  train was a wartime special , seven hours late , which was fine with him . The juice that had accumulated in bed like hog fat was jogged to life by the motion , and he wanted it to last . The stillness when they stopped was like the first moment after death . He was met at the station by a big Negro in a white coat . " You fer th ' foundation ? " asked the Negro . Brian guessed that must mean Salt Rock and he started cautiously shuffling forward . But the Negro stepped up smartly and scooped Brian into his arms like a kitten . " This quicker , " he said . God knows how , he snapped Brian 's braces open so his legs bent and proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in front of all these people . Another Negro , smaller , already had his crutches . There was no way of getting down . " Put you arm roun ' my neck , " said the big one . The neck was huge and slick with sweat , and although Brian was a liberal of course , it made him feel slightly sick . " Go ahead , drop you on you ass if you do n't . " So Brian clung there like a doll , feeling a nuance of helplessness that he had missed up to now . Goddamn , I 'll get well , he thought , to get even . Fuck it , I 'll get well . Cocksucking right , I 'll get well . He could say no more than that . Last night they were saying , " Sir , have you been in the army ? " And now this . The man dumped him in the back of a station wagon , where he bounced like a laundry bag . The car started up with a retching grind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airless day and the countryside looked like a dirty old bum . Brian saw a man dead in a field , with a white handkerchief over his face , or maybe he was justp68sleeping . And houses with collapsed lungs , split bellies , caved-in roofs . Everything very , very sick around here . Brian had his theories about the South , of course . He tried talking to the two Negroes , but found he literally could n't understand their answers . ( Not sure they understood his questions , either . ) Well , cockfuck it , he 'd get well , suckdamnit , he 'd get well , godgoose it  --  cursing was pretty funny , when you came down to it . The dead surroundings charged him with crazy energy . He 'd shake this place until its teeth rattled . It was a long drive , and the two Negroes never once spoke to each other . They drove him eventually into a compound that looked like a deserted army base . " They all at the movies , " said the driver . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't follow  --  would just have to wait and see what it meant . Brian was already thinking in a new dialect . The driver carried him into a prefab , the big neck no problem by now , and flipped him onto an operating-table-type thing and whipped off his pants with surprising delicacy and threw them in a corner . That was a clue . The big dinge wants to examine me . Everybody wants to examine me . " What are you doing with those ? " Brian piped . The guy had whipped the braces off , too . " Wo n't be needn 'm no more , " he said and flung them after the pants hard enough to shatter them . What the hell ? Brian was lost without his braces . He does n't mean I 'll get well that soon , does he ? Who is this nut anyway ? The man finished undressing him and scooped him upp69again and hustled him into the next room , which contained a bathtub on stilts and a big slow-witted fan . The Negro was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian with a plunk into the lukewarm water , which had just been sitting there , and left , and that was the last Brian saw of him . Now bathing had been a big deal at home . A bathing suit , for decency . A bath thermometer . His old man lifting him with trembling back . You got to know what your parents felt like in this racket . How small they were . Who had dandruff . What suit should be thrown out . He had not bathed unattended since the old days . His mother would leave the room while he soaped around inside his trunks . Otherwise , there was always someone watching . Bathing seemed highly dangerous . You could drown in the course of a blink . But here , they let you soak like a pickle . Very nice . He assumed the Negro had told him what to expect next and not to worry . Everything was so slow , there could be no danger . The sun splintered down through a dusty skylight , putting a smoky shine on the bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go into research . A bug the size of a horse began climbing the far wall . Brian eyed him lazily . That could n't be your household roach , could it ? They must be breeding them big down here , to play football and eventually take over the world . The bug changed its plans and disappeared from sight : only to surface again a minute later on the wall next to Brian 's head , just a few inches away . God he wasp70ugly ; Brian imagined the black metal skin crunching under a human foot and the small idiot brain rolling out . Brian was n't scared of insects , but this was no insect . It was a lousy panzer division . No trick at all for it to drop in beside him and wrestle him to death . What the hell would Brian do with it ? He could n't get out of the tub . The son of a bitch would eat him alive . He flapped the water hysterically with his weak left arm . A drop landed on the bug just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Score one for the Western mind . A minute later , though , the bug was back . Maybe he just wants to play . Like a St. Bernard . Brian nervously splashed the water again , but the bug shook it off this time . He 'd learned from his last encounter with the white man . God , this could go on forever . Brian was pumping water on the wall when the door opened . A sandy-haired man in a white apron looked in , and began to shut the door again . " Hey , wait , wait , " said Brian . " Could you get me somebody ? Are you somebody ? " The man said , " You through with your bath ? " " I guess so , yes . " " I 'll get somebody . " Ten minutes later , Brian was out of there , and in another twenty he was dressed and in a wheelchair . People came and went and sent for other people , no one seemed to have any special plan for him . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make wonderful pets . They told him he could check in tomorrow , everybody at the movies right now . He was wheeled to a cabin and leftp71there . The freedom still tingled . Both the beds were smothered in comic books of the Jungle Queen type , and the walls were brilliant with Petty girls . Already a roach was crawling up a pinup 's shining flank , bent on rape . The metal body shook with desire . " Go get her , baby . Screwgie-doos . " Brian was so busy with lust and death that he had n't noticed his roommate come in . " Hi . I 'm Joe Santini . I 'll move my stuff . Christ , what a bomb . Fucking Andrews Sisters . " He was a little dark guy with lightning-quick moves . He took a couple of jog steps over to one of the beds . Belched like a gong and struck his chest . This guy was sick ? He bundled up his funnies and stuffed them under the bed . " You an Italian kid ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . Irish . " " Yeah , well , you could be Irish , too . " " You have n't got polio , have you ? " " Sure . A little trouble with my stomach . " He patted what looked like a perfectly good stomach . " I doubt I 'll fight again . Well shit , I was n't that good anyway . What branch were you in ? " " I was n't in any branch . I 'm still in school . " " Oh yeah ? Hhh . " He grunted . " Hey , it really winged you , did n't it , kid ? Bad , bad . Well , got to be running along . " He jogged back to the door . " Ping-pong calls , " he said . Brian decided to get out of here himself , before the corn/bination of pinups and roaches drove him crazy . His groin was filling like a balloon in the heat . There were two screen doors , and he banged open the one that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut behind . Nothing much back here , a burned-out patch of grass and a concrete path , leading to yet another prefab . They must be putting everything into research . He wheeled around the corner : more concrete , more prefabs . People moving softly , as in dreams . Happy ? Unhappy ? We do not know these words here in Shangri-la . As he got to what he took to be the outskirts , he thought , 01 ' Porgy gon ' roll all de way to New York . He finally came upon some solid-looking crew-cuts standing by the gates , chatting and leaning on golf bags . " Excuse me . " He wheeled up . " You fellows are n't patients , are you ? " " Damn right we are , " said one of them . " You 'll be getting out of here soon , I guess . " " Not if I have anything to say , " said a big fat one . " My anterior tibia may never come back , " he said , doing a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking up space that was needed . Still , he was in now himself , and it was good to see how they cured people around here . He wheeled back through the pale heat . His left wrist was sore as rust from pushing . He had his supper in a dining room that seemed like a Quaker restaurant with another bunch of outstandingly healthy GI 's . Two of them said they had gotten polio in the South Pacific , another lucky bastard got his at Fortp73Dix . Better than having your balls shot off , no ? There was a rumor that one of the nurses put out . They would look into it , especially if it rained tomorrow . At other tables , elderly civilians sat hunched , a few of them drinking their dinners through glass straws , others with drastically short legs or hands as small as a child 's . They had gotten here too late , or too long ago , for the miracle cures the GI 's picked up as a matter of course . It was a tough world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tenderness a healthy guy would feel . After supper , he expected a whistle to blow for bingo or something , but nothing happened . The big recreation hall filled up randomly ; ghost trying to pick up the principles of bridge over people 's shoulders . He watched the big boys in the army fatigues booming ping-pong balls at each other , and then he went to bed and read Santini 's copy of Forever Amber . He was still waiting for Amber to actually do something , when his roommate came roaring in , frisky with booze . " Hey Irish kid , you want a drink ? " " No thanks . " It did n't seem like a great time for his first one . " Are you allowed to drink here ? " " It is n't easy . Hey , you little bastards ! " He had spotted the night 's roaches . " I 'll teach you to eat shit around here . " He picked up a checkerboard and began flailing at them . " You 've eaten your last shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge one splashed to his death.  | " You play checkers ? " asked Brian . " Checkers ? Oh , you mean the board . That 's just for the roaches . Take that , you Japanese cocksucker . Ah , Son of Rising Sun . Here 's a message from the good old U.S. of A. " The room was already black with corpses . Santini looked around satisfied . " Let me know if you have any more trouble , ma'am . " He took his three jog steps to the door . " See you , kid . I hear there 's a nurse on corridor 3 that puts out . " Brian turned out the light , and slept in his sweat and his bower of roaches.  |p75The  next day , they gave him a briefexamination at the main building , which was an actual stone building in the middle of this polio boom town . The doctor kept adjusting Brian 's legs to make sure they were the same length : first pulling one and then the other , till Brian could n't tell himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see if any reflexes were at home , and started to pack up . " Is that all you 're going to do ? " " They seem to be all right , although maybe the left one 's a teeny bit shorter , " the doctor said to the girl in white . " We 'll just have to keep an eye on it . " " I said , is that all you 're going to do ? " " That 's it for now , son . Miss Prendergast will fix up anp76exercise schedule for you . Welcome to Salt Rock . I hope you 're happy here . " He was gone in a flash of white hair and glasses . Were all specialists required to have white hair ? Were doctors ' hands pinker than other people 's ? From all that scrubbing . Also , Miss Prendergast seemed awfully young for a physiotherapist . " When do I get my braces back ? " he asked her . " We 'll make you some new ones while you 're with us . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Salt Rock makes the finest braces in the world . " She was a pretty girl , and Brian was passionately attracted to her , even though she spoke like a Chamber of Commerce . It seemed that the pool schedule was very crowded , with all those servicemen , and that he could only work out every second day . She wheeled him over for a quickie that morning . He lay on an underwater bed , and she worked his legs gently , side to side , up and down . " Is that all ? " he said again . On both sides , he could see malingeringservicemen , grunting over their small problems , hanging on to what was left of their polio , so they would n't have to go back to war . " That 's all we have time for , " she said . " But how do you cure people ? " She smiled and said nothing . She would n't say cure anyway , she would say remarkable improvement . Goddamn , they 'd handed him a lemon . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you tried ping-pong ? " They did n't like the patients to walk , she explained , even on their own fancy braces , because it led to bad habits.  |p77Well  , that was good . In his bones , he still felt that braces were the enemy . They were on the side of death . He wheeled back to the rumpus room , where his friend Santini asked if he would mind buying some cigarettes to share . Santini had used up his own ration , but Brian was a new face at the counter . Santini gave him a buck and told him to keep the change . The line was abuzz with fresh rumors of the nurse who put out . She was the sports page and the financial section , all the news there was around here . Reports had come in this very morning , there was no doubt about it . She was a tiger . " Which one is she ? " Brian asked the man in front . " That one , over there . " " You 're kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with a manila folder , looking for someone to give it to : a nice enough body but surely no tiger . " You 'd be amazed , " said the man . " From what I hear . " Brian quickly wished he had n't been told about it . He could already see her biting and moaning under the hot blankets , as one huge GI piled on after another . " More , more , give it to me , give it to me . " Once , when he was thirteen , he had stumbled over a couple humping in the bushes of Riverside Park , and the girl 's moans had to be believed . Until she said , " Get lost , you nosy little bastard . " So he associated women in sex with spitting rage . " Give it to me , Brian , give it to me . " The night transformationof the mouse into a raging whore was too much for his fragile glands . Impure thoughts were bad enough , when the girls hadp78no faces . But when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the gospel it said that once you had lusted after a woman in your heart , you 'd as good as frugeled her . In which case , of course .. . " Next , " said the girl at the counter . " Er , Chesterfields , I guess . And a big Hershey bar . " Would the same man order both ? And was there any way in which he was eligible for a crack at the tiger ? Or was it just servicemen ? And if he got there , how did he manage the mechanics ? Heaving and fumbling for his gold . Would she help him , or would she curse impatiently and tell him to make way for a real man ? All afternoon long , he imagined her pounding his back with her fists , cursing , face alternately scarlet with desire and white with disgust ; ah , forget it , Casey . It 's a sin , and besides it 's impossible . He did try a little ping-pong , his right arm was plenty strong enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye level and swatting it back with an overhand shot . But it did n't help materially with the nurse problem . The heat roasted his crotch till it was a purple inferno . Any moment it would combust and bury the place in hot lava . There was nothing of consequence to do around here . He wheeled over to the one-room library and found that all the books excited him sexually , especially the dull ones . He certainly was in no shape to tangle with Forever Amber . No exercises at all till tomorrow , while the war heroes hogged the pool . How did he get on the nurse 's quota ? Geez , Casey , get your mind out of the gutter.  |p79Funny  , he could think " fuck , " but he could n't think " Christ . " Into that nurse 's pants . He met some more people that evening , but not very decisively . He played checkers with an elderly Frenchman who skinned him alive , and he studied some more bridge . While puzzling through the bidding conventions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top and wildness below . Thighs flying while the nursing cap stays primly put . How do women feel about paralyzed legs ? Must be creepy for them . Before turning in , he decided to make a sly tour . Might just run into something . Corridor 3 , eh ? If anybody would understand about bad legs , it was a nurse . Start there . Now look , God , sir , I 'll only do it once , I promise . A sin , a sin , I know , but it 's a church of sinners , look at all the saints who had a whack at it before they went straight . Write a confession out of this world when it 's all done . Besides , I wo n't find her . It 's just words in my head so far , no harm . Besides , look , it 's also a test of courage . Confidence is essentialin my position , it 's kind of a special case . And she likes it , does n't she ? I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , and Joseph  --  there was a party in corridor 3 . Dirty laughter under the door , and bright dirty light . That must be the preliminary part . Brian tried quickly to remember what he 'd decided about the moral question . Sin , courage . Polio made you a special case . That , my son , is a rationalization . Do n't bother to try it on the Almighty as the boiling manure rises to your armpits . Hell is n't reallyp80like that . How do you know ? Then he saw that thinking must now cease . His mind would filibuster till dawn if he let it . He must simply act . With a deep thrill of decision , he rolled his chair to the door and knocked . The laughter snapped off . He probably needed a password . They seemed to be moving about in there , probably getting rid of the nurse . " Who is it ? " " Casey . " " Who the hell is Casey ? Anybody know a Casey ? " Pause . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him , Santini said , " Oh Christ , it 's the Irish kid . Come in and join the party . " Five hairy GI 's were sprawled around in their undershirts . No trace of nurse . They began hauling bottles and glasses from under the beds . " Boy , you had me scared there , " said a redheaded guy about Brian 's age . " Sam Rogers . Nix on the Ginger , O.K. ? " " You want a drink ? " asked Santini . " Yeah , I guess so . " Might as well prove some kind of courage tonight . He did n't see how they could fit a gangbangin here anyway . It probably did n't work like that . She probably provided individual room service . He could see her silvering in by moonlight , purring softly  --  enough of that , Casey , for pity 's sweet sake . The big thing now is not to choke on this drink here . They 'd filled the tumbler with Scotch and ice , and it burned like lighter fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum and went " aagh , " as if expressing ad/miration , and glanced around to see whom he 'd fooled . Nobody was paying any attention . " Listen , for the last time , does this chick Brenda put out or does n't she ? " " Let 's take it one by one . Murphy swears she does . Jacksonis n't talking , but sources close to Jackson say he is payingtop dollar for condoms . " " Oh man , " said Rogers , clasping a hand to his groin . " I 'd like to get my hands on that muff . For just twenty-four hours . Then you could cut it off . " " They 'd probably have to . " " Ah , you guys are going stir-crazy . It 's what the doctors call the will to believe . Nobody puts out for apes like you . " " O.K. , you bastards . I 'll find out for myself , " said Rogers . " When ? " " Tomorrow . " " How ? " " I 'll tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to atrophy if not massaged immediately . " " She 'd just send you to Dr. Pipgras . For a measure-ment . " Brian did n't feel drunk , but he sensed an animal menace , a stirring in wet jungles . These guys were trained killers . He saw their sweat shining in the moonlight as they stalked the wily nurse . Slipping wire round the sentry 's neck , aargh ! and then one by one into the tent , on hands and knees . " Hey , kid , you just get here ? " " Huh ? Yeah . Yesterday . " " Did they say when they 're going to operate ? " said Santini.  | " Operate ? What do you mean by that ? " His voice sounded prep school . Would fucking operate be better ? Easy to swear in your head . " Yeah . That 's what they sent you here for , is n't it ? " " Nobody said anything about operating . " Santini looked around . " Is n't it a shame ? The way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's better if you do n't know , " said Rogers . " You do ? Boy , not me . The first time I got that dawn call , I shit my pants . " " Yeah , that 's rough too . I do n't know . What 'd they tell you they were shaving you for , Joe ? " " A routine hygiene precaution . They say that hair collectsfungi or some such bullshit . Do n't you believe it , of buddy . " Santini looked at Brian and shook his head . " When they come to shave you , it 's the knife and nothing but the knife . " " I totally disagree with you , Santini , " a fellow named Gene Something said . " Christ , you sweat all night when they shave you . Frankly , I 'd rather not know . " " Just the footsteps in the hall and the knock on the door ? " " That 's right . " Gene nodded . " Anyway , maybe the kid 's got an area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They shave the foot . " " Well , the kid looks kind of light on hair . How 's the foot , son ? " " They would n't operate without permission , " said Brian.  |p83His  head was buzzing suddenly , like a refrigerator . " I did n't give them permission . " " How old are you ? " " Seventeen . " " They do n't need your permission . I expect your old man signed the clearance . " " He would n't do that . " " Yeah ? Listen  --  you would n't be here if he did n't . What do you think this place is all about ? " " Cure . " " Cure ? Salt Rock ? There must be some mistake . The last time they cured somebody around here , Jesus Christ said he frankly could n't believe it . " Santini looked as if he was going to cry . " All right , maybe you 'll be the lucky one . But you sure as hell wo n't get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operating fool . You notice , he 's always measuring legs ? Does n't know what the fuck he 's doing it for half the time . Especially when he 's had a few belts . Christ , he sees three legs then . And if he finds one of them a centimeter out , you 've had it . Zock , slash . Do you know , there was one girl in here who had thirteen operationscorrecting the first one ? Her foot looked like a fuckingmedicine ball . " " Hey kid , you want to throw up someplace ? " " I 'm all right . " " Had you pissing green there , did n't we ? " " Did n't believe you , " Brian managed to mumble . " No ? That 's good . You sure looked funny . You want another drink ? "  |p84Brian  shook his head . Opening his mouth would be fatal . They laughed without malice . He should n't have burst into their room . This was what he got for it . He hung on a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlesslyabout Brenda 's pussy , and then he left , and vomited up his humiliation in his own basin and cleaned up as best he could . The Infante , the eunuch beyond price , sat on his fluffy cushions . The women petted him and dowsed him with perfume . The little prince is not himself today . He fell in with some rough soldiers , and they made him cry . Brian flayed himself , in a drunken doze . He used to be a tough kid , by neighborhood standards . Nobody ever pulled anything like this on him before . God , he was soft . People had been too nice to him for too long . He 'd forgottenthe jungle watchfulness of male society , the playful pounce at the throat . Well , shit , he 'd be ready next time . Santini 's voice , somewhere in the dark : " You all right , kid ? " Fuck off . Santini turned on the light and began combing his hair for bed , over the basin . " Christ , you really made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burrowedinto his doze . The next day , Sunday , was hot  --  surprise . The veterans were hanging around the game room in clusters of stupefiedsilence . It was like a Civil War engraving . The garrison could n't hold out much longer without water . " What 's the matter with everybody ? " Brian asked a guy . " There was a bust last night on corridor z . " " What happened ? "  | " Some nurse was caught with three guys . " " Yeah ? " A sweet , vicious thrill , no denying it . " Yeah . They 're on the mat right now . Poor bastards . " " What about the nurse ? " " I do n't know . Canned , I guess . Must have been a sweet kid , huh ? A goddamn angel . Could n't bear to watch people suffer . " The guy scratched his nose . " I wish I 'd known about it . " " I knew , " said Brian . " Yeah ? You did , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the library . " The period of mourning extended about halfway through breakfast . Guys who had , guys who had n't were all equally bereaved . " Things like that never last in this lousy mothering world , " said someone at Brian 's table . " Shit , you know she was due on 4 this very night ? Goddamnit . " He howled like a puma . They began laughing after that and parodying their own heat , and by the end of the meal there was a hairy gaiety in the air . Brian glimpsed the little nurse slipping shyly past the dining room in her street clothes  --  impossible to believe she was responsible for these wild stirrings . " ' Bye , doll , " murmured someone . " It 's been real . " The older civilians ate on solidly while the boys whooped . He went to church after that , a small white chapel for Catholics , thinly attended this morning . A dozen very serious-looking fellows , conspicuously clean-living , not ones to be caught up in the Brenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all terribly cheap andp86dirty . The girl was ruined , three soldiers were probably about to be court-martialed , and all the guys could think of to do was roll their eyes and gibber . Thank God or his guardian angel he had wheeled down the wrong corridor last night . Jesus , how could he face his parents ? He almost dropped his missal at the thought . He could just see them at their window . His mother struck dumb with grief , makingstrangled animal sounds , his father frosty with contempt . " I told you , my dear . The boy is no good . It was a mistake adopting him from the gypsies in the first place . " His mother proceeding to cry non-stop for the next fifty years . He wondered if any Catholics had taken advantage of Brenda , and how they felt this morning . Santini came in late and knelt at the back . He winked at Brian and held his head sympathetically . Church was as white and clean as a nursery , and the priest was fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers or his own puke-drenched mouth . My God , how could he expect a miraculous cure after the way he 'd behaved last night . Getting drunk was not so terrible , although it certainly felt that way . He did n't think it had become a habit yet . But those impure thoughts , ay yi yi . " You knew perfectly well that corridor 3 was an occasion of sin , did n't you , my son ? " " Courage , confidence , church of sinners " ... he remembered with sickly accuracy his little list of excuses . " Yes , well , you see , my son , those are the things the devil whispers to each of us to get us to sin . He 's a very clever salesman , you know . He 's got a different line for each customer . " " Yes , Father . So have you , Father . "  |p87I  was disobedient four times and I told three lies . His confessions had n't really changed since he was seven . Even if he confessed murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one act of thoughtlessness . Brian began to wonder if he was n't a little more childish in the religious area than other areas ? And might n't that be one of the things that had softened him ? He felt too lousy to think it through . If he wanted a miracle , he 'd better stick to the book . And clean up his language while he was about it . Sloppy thoughts , sloppy life . In such a small chapel every communion was noted . So he wheeled up reluctantly . He decided he qualified technically , but , landing on his furry tongue , the host tasted of prussic acid . Santini grinned from the back . He determined to avoid the ribaldry that afternoon . Read a book or something . He tried writing home , but could n't think of anything that had happened except the gangbang on corridor 2 . Forever Amber was still by his bedside , but he saw the danger of books like that . Like for instance , they glamorize a girl who puts out and do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filthy things men say about her , the cruel shit-eating grins . He thought of the guys howling over their breakfast as the girl who had been so nice to them crept away unnoticed . Christ , it was a vicious world . He sat alone in his room with the flies buzzing and Santini 's artwork torturing him with the same old lies . It starts out as a joke , and before you know it , you 're crawling down corridors looking for pussy . He honestly did n't know if he could cope with it . He had a hopeless erection ,  |p88|primed  with heat , disgust , a yearning to be good . If he eased it with his hands he would be damned for sure ; a good resolution should hold up for one afternoon . The priest in his head had one last shot . He pointed to the soldiers who had been found out this morning : shrunken , embarrassed , all the starch gone out of them , in the chilly judgment room . Not so impressive now , are they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin . Those same men who pranced around the halls clutching their groins and baying for pussy , look at them today . Well , maybe the priest was right at that , maybe that stuff was the real weakness , by God . A guy with his pants around his knees , squirming under a cop 's flashlight . . . It was part of his own softness that he had masturbated to such slovenly excuses . He would do so no more . Christianitywas hard , not soft . The spasm of willpower cooled and strengthened him . The erection collapsed like an empty sock . He wheeled back out to the game room , feeling a gorgeous disdain for the soldiers playing their pointless bridge and chewing the slow afternoon fat . They were as pointless as the peopleon the railway platform , the drifters . Talking the silly gossip of their time and place in history , feeding , sleeping , dying , and leaving no trace . He , Brian , would vault past them , with willpower and vision . A cure was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they began to trickle in  --  anxious men in rimless glasses , stout ladies in faded prints . Outside of the ones with an obvious mission ,  |p89they  were just sightseers : old people who liked to be around sickness , young people 's sickness ; retired real-estate men who could have gone to the seaside but preferred to be here , among the wheelchairs . The patients went on with their business . The morning 's poontang brouhaha was already a memory . Maybe it was just a gag ; watch for that , Casey . You 've been fooled before . A lot of life 's terrors were just gags . The visitors walked slowly past the bridge tables , peering at the man who had to have his cards played for him , or the one who picked them up in his teeth ( another gag , but they did n't know it ) , sighing softly and moving on . At the last table , up by the dining room , a big strapping patient , healthier than they were , rose as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yowsah , yowsah . Step right up and see the crip-puls . See them walk , see them talk , see them crawl on their bel-ly like a reptile . " There was a harsh howl of laughter , walling in the visitors . The boys ' pussy had been taken away , but they still had this . The old people flinched and stood helpless under the whip . Sick people were entitled to their fun . Brian found himself taking it up , without even thinking . " Yeah  --  see them groan , see them moan , " he shouted . " Spot a twisted limb and win a prize . " Hard , brutal kidding , the kind they did so well here . " We do n't call ' em freaks , and we do n't call them geeks , we just call them handicapped citizens with wonderful spirits . Do n't feed them , just pray for them . " The visitors seemed to crowd together . Being laughedp90at by cripples is probably no fun for an old man . Well , let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you want a relic ? How 's about a nice paralyzed toe , our Sunday special ? " Brian had become a cheerleader , usheringthe guests out . Several patients looked at him , and the guy who had started it said , " You 're O.K. , kid . Do n't overdo it now . " Brian liked the place fine.  |p91He  got letters the next week from hisparents and from both his aunts . It seemed that Blessed Herbert Weatherby was still fighting for his life  --  which , Brigid pointed out , made it a perfect time for a miracle . A miracle might very well clinch the case for his existence , after which canonization would be clear sailing . Dr. Steinmetz continued his troubled wanderingsand had fetched up in Canada , where he was exploringthe properties of elk sperm . The perfect sperm , he believed . Meanwhile , as Steinmetz waited for the elks to deliver , Portia recommended the enclosed article on carrot juice . Brian took the enclosed article and tore it in four . The old girls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand of a child . Portia 's typing was blotched with inked insertions , words crossed out , and arrows running up and down the sides . He half expected to find a couple of arrows pointing at each other at the bottom . If he 'd seen their writing sooner , it would have spared him some excitement . Anyway , what could you expect from a limey saint ? He did not , mind you , rule out miracles completely . They had been proved in Rome , by very stringent tests . He was still bucking for Lourdes . The big leagues of this business . But he was not going to weaken himself with low-grade bullshit . The soft pliability of the water in the pool still gave him the impression that he might make it on his own . He surged his legs in and out against the feathery water  --  O.K. , it was still the hip , but they were moving . A little more concentration and he might be able to force the message down past his hips and into the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bear . Almost ! He had read somewhere that people who conquered polio built up more confidence than they knew what to do with . So be it . In due time , they made the new braces for him , light and streamlined as promised . But he was only allowed to wear them about fifteen minutes a day , in drills as strict as ballet classes . Anything more would lead to bad habits . In just this one respect , the place was bizarrely professional . Meantime , the sight of people in wheelchairs began to seem normal . A wheelchair world . Even the GI 's usedp93them if they had the slightest excuse . Sick was good . Or so it seemed until V-E Day . Santini and another guy hopped wheelchairs that day and staged a race down the center of the recreation room to celebrate . Brian promptly appointedhimself public-address system , with a rolled-up magazine for a megaphone . " Five laps , and no getting out of the chair to push it on the turns , " he called . Cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Santini ran a dirty race from the start , banging chairs and forcing his opponent into the crowd . " They 're in the stretch . Santini is cutting him off . Pow ! Jackson belts him in the rear . And pushes him forward ten feet . Jackson tries to come up on the outside . Pow ! Santini almost takes his ankle off . Jackson is getting out of his chair now . He 's hitting Santini with his cap . The place is bedlam , ladies and gentlemen . Santini is trying to bite Jackson 's hand . Jackson is mounted again . They 're heading for the wire . Santini is zagging all over the course . Jackson is laughing so hard he ca n't roll , and Santini crosses the line to win the first V-E Day Classic . Jackson is still out on the track protesting ... In fact , the stewards tell me that both men have been disqualified . Santini knocked over a bridge table and Jackson did n't pass the saliva test . No payoff . " Brian had never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sick was no longer quite so good . The cripples would soon rise from their chairs and saunter off . And he wondered what kind of fear made a man willing to fake paralysisin the first place . Or exaggerate it anyway . From scraps he had picked up at table , one GI talking at a time , hep94pictured war as a solitary affair : a lone man coughing blood into the snow , lost behind enemy lines , praying for the Red Cross wagon to drive up like a Good Humor truck and bundle him into the warm safety of sickness . War was a great time for cripples . No one could ask a cripple to fight . After the Japs were beaten , the GI 's would pull out , leaving the lifers , the professionals . God , he did n't want to be left with those . Meanwhile , he kept up those little bursts of resolution , but bridge kept taking his mind off his cure . He had proved to be a pretty fair player with a great memory and an almostvisual sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round game , somebody else was rhomboid . Made no sense , but it worked against average to good players ( it was no good against the crazies ) . He won secondprize in a house tournament and would have finished first except for a triangle who suddenly turned into a trapezoid , doubled and redoubled . It was still a stupid waste of time , and he felt guilty about it . For hours he would forget his mission completely , would even be annoyed to have to break for exercise , and then , while Miss Prendergast cranked , would proceed to replay hands instead of attending to his tibia . Miss Prendergastwas an assembly-line physiotherapist who jerked limbs to some private quota , so if he did n't try , nobody tried . At night , he thought about willpower , but what was the good of thinking about willpower at night ? His eyes closed on a vision of aces and kings.  |p95Santini  decided to chance the Japanese war and announcedhimself recovered . He rolled up his Petty girls and threw them in the trash can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained . " Did you really have polio ? " asked Brian . " You ca n't fake it , can you ? " Santini said , " Sure I had it . Everyonehere had it . Maybe I just got better a little too fast . " Brian wanted to say , " Do n't go . Keep on pretending . " If everyone pretended to have polio , it would be a better world . Besides , he did n't want to see his crazy friend replaced by some sick guy . He did n't want the healthy guys to leave him . Santini 's replacement was a gnome named Winters , a sickie for fair , with a barrel chest and legs like a bird . Brian could hardly bear to look at him , as he perched on his pillowIndian-style , fussily unpacking . As soon as enough stuff was laid out , Winters would flip his bird legs over the side , pounce onto his chair , and go skittering over to the dresser . " Hey , " said Brian , full of fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them ? I ought to . I 've had nine of them . You want to see my foot ? " " Not specially . Oh , all right . " The guy had whipped off his sock . It was n't as bad as Brian expected , not the swollen sea-green nightmare he pictured . But polio was still pretty damn disgusting . " You 've been here before ? " he asked . " Every year since I was three . " " How old are you now ? " " Nineteen . " Now that was really shocking . Brian almostp96said , " You 're a liar , " but saw how this might hurt . The man was an aging forty from head to foot . " How 's the talent this year ? " said Winters . He began brushing his sleek black hair with military brushes . " Any good twat ? " " Geez , not much . " This guy too ? Brian could only think of three girls who were young enough to rate as twat and of these , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of course , she had polio , and Brian could never make time with a girl with polio . He was a leg man , and he could n't face it . " Well , we 'll have to make do with what 's around , " said Winters , smoothing his mustache . It was obscene . This dwarf was duding himself up like a lover . Flashing his teeth and sluicing himself in after-shave . " I 'll go out and do some scouting , " he said . " A good-looking guy like you should have a girl . " Nothing came of it , that first evening . Winters returned empty-handed and sat on his pillow and talked sex , more than even the GI 's did . He talked about girls he had had here in the past , and about a luscious waitress he was screwing right now up in Toronto . Brian tried not to visualizeit  --  the first excruciating pass , the girl recoiling but trying not to hurt the little fellow 's feelings , and the occasionalfreak conquest , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all the world like Clark Gable , at his prize . Brian had nothing to offer in return . Winters 's activities would have silenced Errol Flynn . Besides , he did n't carep97to discuss his sex life in the same terms as this guy 's . He shut his eyes and hoped Winters would fall asleep . But when he opened them a crack , he saw that Winters was still on his pillow , writing postcards . The next few nights were the same . Winters would go on about luscious pieces of ass and great tits until Brian dropped off . Where had he learned to talk like that ? A cripple for life , always between operations , he must have deduced that this was how normal people talked . Yet he did n't have it quite right . " Man , what poontang . " Phrases that were meant to be funny came out as solemn as medical terms . He did n't know how to be dirty . Brian was glad he himself remembered the real world and still knew the differencebetween ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become certain it was all just talk , Winters struck pay dirt . Not for himself , but for Brian . He said he had met a girl who was crazy for Brian 's body . " Who , who ? " " Anna May Tompkins . " " Anna May Tompkins ? " She was one of the grotesques . " Yeah , the nice little blonde . " Brian stared at the little Clark Gable grin . So this was what he meant by ass . Real gluteus maximus stitched and stuffed like a goose by a hundred unsuccessful operations . Anna May Tompkins looked like Mr. Punch , bobbing over her wheels , but to Winters she was a princess . God , get me out of this beggars ' opera . The thought of that little creature lusting for him , thinking he was attainable , gave him the green sweats . Yeah  --  this was what creptp98into your room at night if you had real polio . Not some strapping nurse but Mr. Punch , hopping in beside you like a frog , crooning obscene nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be lucky to play as well as Wintersin it . He looked at his own legs , thin as a **26;14923;TOOLONG , and at his weak left hand , which would be a passenger in any future lovemaking , and thought , What the hell else do you expect ? What else are you good for ? Winters , happy with his dwarf 's world picture and his gnomish matchmaking said , " You 're really a good-looking kid , you know that ? Anna May said you look like a Greek god . Yeah . A Greek god . You know , you can have her in here any time you like . " For the next few days , Brian stayed mostly in his room . He could n't stand to watch Anna May , who flirted like a courtesan under Winters 's urging , and he was absolutely through with bridge . This whole place was a trick to get you used to polio , that was the magic formula and that was your cure . You left here a contented cripple . He tried flexing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was . It was all a lazy dream  --  I 'll do it next month , or the month after , when I really try . All right , he was trying now . He stared up at the malignant calendar . Better by Christmas , better by spring . It was now midsummer , and not one damned thing had changed . Those stupid legs were dead . The babe on the calendar , Santini 's last bequest , simpered at him . " Do n't touch me , you deformedson of a bitch . "  |p99His  father 's next letter was not too well timed . " Dear Brian , your recent letters sound exceptionally mature and accepting . You seem to have learned wonderfully how to live with your affliction . Of course , your mother and I still pray confidently for your complete recovery . But if the Good Lord should decide otherwise . . . " Do n't give me the Good Lord , please . Not you . . . " still have a wonderful life , all the stronger for the experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . . . I think now at last I can write to you like this . You probably faced it before we did . " He fired back , " I definitely want to try Lourdes , in the fall at the latest . And in the meantime , I 'd like to explore everything , I do n't care how crazy it is . Even Dr. Steinmetzif necessary . Anything at all . I have not resigned myself to this one little bit . " There is nothing mature about giving up . Now to the embarrassing part . " Look , Dad , I know how hard I had to try to get you to send me here , so I feel funny saying it was a mistake . But it really is . They do n't do anythinghere . The place is a complete fraud and the public should know about it . " Yeah , I admit I had a good time . Another of their tricks . That night , Winters told him not to be so choosy , he wished Anna May liked him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass at her himself , " but her heart belongs to you , daddy-o " ( said as solemnly as a clergyman ) . Brian asked him to shut the hell up , and went to bed . His throat shook with rage over his damn disease and the people whop100would n't help him with it . Meanwhile , Winters wheeled around killing roaches , with hands as fast as any prizefighter's.  |p101His  parents threw a party for his return . The apartment was hung with a WELCOME HOME banner and there was a white cake with his name on it . Hennessy was along , sweating in his blue shirt , and Phil Marconi had his curly hair slicked down . Why were they all dressed up ? It was like a funeral parlor , a lying-in . The guests all told him , with false-teeth smiles , that he was looking fine , lookingwonderful . ( " How do I look , Marconi ? " he whispered . " The same , " said Phil . ) " You 're walking better , much much better , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled on his stomach , they would say he was walking better . It was meaningless . He missed the derision of Salt Rock . Here he was the only one of his kind . When his Aunt Brigid told him he was walking better ,  |p102he  said , " No , I 'm not . " This was the junk he 'd listened to last year . He used to be flattered by it . " How 'm I walking , Marconi ? " He hoped that Phil would say , " You call that stuff walking ? " but he just said , " Fine . " Toward the end of the wake , Hennessy edged over and said in a low voice , " What are the symptoms of polio , Brian ? " " Who wants to know ? " " I think I may have it . " " You 're kidding . " Brian 's heart leaped an inch . " I feel kind of weak . " " Yeah ? Go on . " " My knee hurts . " " That 's bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . What do you think ? " Oh brother , if the boys down at Salt could get hold of this guy now , they 'd have him pissing in his shoes . Let me at this virgin . So Brian thought , First I 'll ask him if he sweats a lot . Fatso was rolling in sweat right now . Then I 'll ask him if he 's short of breath ; he always has been , but he may not have thought about it before . Brian grinned an evil grin and shook his head slowly . Slowly does it , with bad news . Maybe a heart murmur  --  anyone can imagine one of those . Then he looked again at the poor suffering bastard and thought , I ca n't do it . Fatso would fall down in a seizure . You could n't play these games with soft , healthy people . " It 's all right , Fatso . Everyone feels like that in the summer . Do n't give it a thought . "  | " You 're sure about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the last thing to know . " He started to describe how the symptoms worked , but caught himself in time . He was n't going to be a polio bore . It was fun giving Fatso his reprieve , anyway , and Brian felt O.K. for the rest of the party . He had sensed since his arrival that something was wrong between his parents . They were diplomatic with each other , but there was a sense of interrupted quarrel about them . They would go at it again , the moment his back was turned . " Is anything wrong ? " he asked , over supper . " Wrong ? " " Yes , I think we should be honest with each other . I grew up a lot down there , you know . " They nodded . Growing up did not mean that you spoke freely , of course . " There 's nothing wrong , that I know of , " said Kevin . " It 's been a tough summer at the office , I 'll say that much . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this world . " " Nothing wrong , " echoed Beatrice . " Well , that 's good . So how about Lourdes ? " Kevin spread his hands . " How about it ? " " I want to go . Right away . " " There 's a war on . " " Yeah , so I hear . I mean as soon as it 's over . " His motherp104pursed her lips at the slight rudeness , but pursed lips broke no bones . His father overlooked it and said , " The Japanese may hold out for a long time . Hopping from island to is-land . " " Yeah , they may , they may . " " And travel restrictions will probably continue into the indefinite future . " " Yeah , well , of course I understand that . I just want to know if I can go the moment it 's possible . " " That 's so iffy , Brian , I do n't see any point in discussing it . " " I 'd just like an answer , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . " " I told him , we 'll see . He 's going to have to go to school in a couple of months . We 'd have to fit it in with that . I do n't know . " He hit the table suddenly , as if it were a prison door . " There 's no need to shout , " said Beatrice . " All right , I wo n't , I 'm sorry . I just want you to know , these decisions are complicated . You do n't have to make as many decisions as I do . " " We are a cheerful group tonight , " said Beatrice . " No , no , this is good , " said Brian . " I want to have everything out in the open . We 've always been too polite around here . Tell me , Father , what is your real opinion about this Lourdes thing ? Is it too expensive ? " " I could raise the money , I guess . " " And could n't you get me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important friends ? "  | " Maybe . " " Good . Is it that you do n't really believe in it , then ? " " I said it was an iffy question . " " I think you should know , " said Beatrice with sudden breathless primness , " that your father has stopped going to church . " " Is that so ? " " Come on , Beatrice ! You know that has nothing to do with it . " " I think it might have , Father . Why did you stop going ? " " Churchgoing is a personal thing . I do n't have to explain it to anyone . " " I think you owe your son an explanation . Belief in God has a direct bearing on his cure . I think he has a right to know if a member of his family has lost his faith . " Her face was stiff , like an old lady 's . Brian did n't want his side to be tainted with any more craziness . " It does n't matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to stop believing . It 's better than hypocrisy . I just want to know whether you think going to Lourdes is a personal thing too ? Do your private feelings about the Church affect that ? " " I told you it was the travel restrictions , " said Kevin . He looked at his son beseechingly . " I have to make very difficultdecisions . I 'll get you there if I can . " " Good . That 's settled . Now how about Dr. Steinmetz ? " He had never won an argument with his father in his life , and he did n't want to stop . " Dr. Steinmetz ? That charlatan you were telling usp106about ? Brian  --  even you were making fun of him , remem-ber ? " " Yes , I remember . But since then I 've tried the respectablepeople , the regular doctors , and look what I 've got for it . " He thought of wheeling back from the table and pointingdramatically at his legs , but decided that was bush . It was too easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous specialists and I 've tried their famous sickiefarmand their good sense . Now I 'm ready to try a fool . " " And where is this Dr. Steinmetz ? " " I think he 's in Canada . " " Canada ? You want me to send you to Canada ? And Lourdes as well ? " " Why not ? " Kevin looked at Beatrice : surely she would see the folly of this . " Look , I 'm trying to be a decent man  --  O.K. , there 's nothing special about that , I know . I 'm sorry I mentioned it . But did n't you say that this man experiments with elk sperm ? Brian  --  apart from anything else , it 's bad for you to start believing in people like that . " Beatrice said , " I do n't see anything wrong with elk sperm . " Right , " said Brian quickly , before he could laugh . " I know it sounds silly to you . But most medical things sound silly , do n't they ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Well , that 's true . " Kevin grinned and Brian almost grinned back . " And is n't it really because the stuff he works withp107sounds silly that people laugh at him ? I mean it 's not somethingsilly about him , I bet he 's no crazier than , well , Beethoven . " They both giggled , as if this were the kind of wild discussion they used to have in the old days with nothing at stake . His father kept smiling at him to make him laugh . " Yes , all right , I 'll grant you the elk sperm , " said Kevin . " I 'll grant you whale blubber , if you like . But did n't you say something about leeches , too ? " Brian answered fast , to kill the humor , " Yes  --  and did n't they use leeches for thousands of years ? Do you think people were crazy for all that time ? Or do you think the leeches may just possibly have done them some good ? " Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe it . I never thought I 'd sit in my own house and hear my own family recommending elk sperm and leeches . I must be going out of my mind . " " That 's what the doctors say . And look at what they did for me . " " I think he should be allowed to try it , " said Beatrice . " What have we got to lose ? " Kevin looked glassy-eyed . Would n't someone for godsakelaugh ? " Maybe we can find something in the city , " he said . They wrote to Dr. Steinmetz and he wrote back , a quite professional-looking letter , packed in brochures , describingvarious Steinmetz products  --  a vibrator , some kind ofp108pump , a special Steinmetz honey contrived in Pennsylvania . He said he just happened to have a disciple in New York , a Dr. Schroeder on the Lower East Side . So Brian and his mother went off to look for Schroeder . They found that the fruits of being out of favor with the medical establishment showed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sodden listless flies that you could catch with a sick left hand . Schroeder 's building looked deserted . The downstairs apartments were gutted and the windows blown out . The second floor said MODERN DANCE STUDIO in rusty letters . The mailboxes in the hall had no nameplates , except for a piano tuner in 3A and Dr. Schroeder in 5B . Brian had asked his mother to come along , because his father 's silent skepticism would have been a burden . Even a thing like this required faith . He heaved his way stiffly up the narrow stairwell , gatheringdust on his good right hand . It was terribly hot , and a deep breath would choke you to death in seconds . Still , Brian trusted it now more than the smart-ass salons on Park Avenue , with the bound copies of Fortune . Real miracleshappened in dirt and darkness . He pictured Dr. Schroeder as a brilliant drunk with trembling hands , the kind who turned up as ship 's doctor in the movies . ( " Only three men alive know how to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it in a tornado ? " ) He was n't quite that , but a red-faced German with faded red hair and a white coat a size too small for him . Brian was glad his father was n't here with his damn irony.  |p109An  enormous nurse took down Brian 's particulars , while the doctor watched with bulging blue eyes . Doctors were supposed to leave during this part ; it seemed unprofessionalnot to . Brian gazed around . Most doctors had so many diplomas on the wall , you wondered where they found the time ; but not Schroeder . He just had the one , on yellowing paper , with his name spelled wrong . Was Ulm a university ? or one of his qualifications ? " Now let 's have a look at the boy , " said Schroeder . " You want me to take off my pants ? " " Ja , in a moment . But first I want to see something . " And without further warning , he made a heavy lunge at Brian and drove two fingers into his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth  --  a seam of sour lead on each side . " You see ? " said Schroeder triumphantly . " See what ? " " It hurts , la ? " " Ja . I mean , yes . " " You speak a little German , no ? " The doctor gave a jolly chuckle , and the enormous nurse shook like jelly . " Dot 's very good . Now , let me explain what caused you to say ouch . It was nothing less than the poison in your jugular . " " What poison ? " " The poison that causes the polio . Once your jugular begins to stop hurting like that , again you will be well . " " I do n't get the connection . I mean , what has my neck got to do with my legs ? " " Look  --  I make the connection for you . " He lunged atp110Mrs . Casey this time and jabbed her neck . She was startled and her hat fell off . " You see ? " He stood triumphantly over her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt really ? I mean , except for the normal pressure of the fingers ? " " No , it did n't , " said Beatrice . Brian stared at her  --  hey , this was something , a genuine sign . Ulm or no Ulm , no other doctor had proved his bona fides so decisively . His mother smiled back , catching Brian 's excitement . " O.K. , O.K.  --  how do we get it out ? " " Ah , that 's where my little friends come in , my little leeches . " " Really ? That 's the only way ? " " Maybe , maybe not . It is one way , and it works . " He was the soul of reasonableness . " They 're very clean , you know , and they seem to know instinctively just the right amount of blood to take . Here , let me show you the little fellows . " He took Brian into a cubicle behind a curtain . It contained in cramped alignment a table and a bed and a bowl full of fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock nightmare come true . The roaches crawling along his neck and eating him alive . " They fall off as soon as they 're full , " Schroeder explained . " They 're like tiny little doctors , they know just what 's good for you . " He seemed awfully fond of them . The blue eyes sparkled with love . I do n't know if I can face it , thought Brian . Yet perhaps this was what the praying prepared you for : you had to go through your personal hell for a cure . Religion and science mating in squalor . Pain , dirt , and darkness , that 's wherep111miracles came from , not from spanking-clean offices and doctors with pink hands . Almost gagging in the heat , he said , " I 'll do it . Let 's go . Put ' em on me . " " Ah , no , " the doctor chuckled his jolly-innkeeper chuckle , " not so fast . We have to prepare them . Diet and so on . We have to make them just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment for next week . " They pushed back through the curtain . It was like a priest 's hovel in Graham Greene , as opposed to an antisepticProtestant church . " Miss Hoffman , give this young man an appointment for next week . " " Are n't you going to look at my legs ? " " Oh , ja , ja . Let 's have a look at them . " Brian went back into the cubicle and took off his pants and braces . He made a point of staring down the leeches , to master them . He even put his nose to the glass . They looked like pure evil , dozing in their bowl , drunk on human blood . But they were angels deep down , sent to cure him . From the way Dr. Schroeder peered at the legs , it was obvious that he did n't know what to make of them . He gave a slight push to the right one , and then pushed it quickly back for fear it would roll off the table . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Schroeder looked closely at the left foot and pushed it up . " Can you feel that ? " he said . " Of course . " " Well , you better get dressed now . " The doctor went outp112quickly as if he could n't stand any more . The silly so-and-so did n't know beans about polio . But he had the key to it , in that bowl . Through the curtain , Brian heard the nurse say , " That will be twenty dollars , please . " A pause . " You want it now ? " " Yes , we want it now , please . " Brian pushed through . Miss Hoffman stood at the desk impassively , and the doctorwatched , obscenely . Mrs. Casey fumbled out her checkbook , and the nurse said , " The doctor prefers cash . It 's better for his bookkeeping . " Beatrice had eighteen dollars and enough for cab fare . They said they 'd take the eighteen and collect the rest next week . Brian knew there was something wrong with all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's did n't . And that was the sturdiest hope so far . It did n't matter if they were crooks  --  heck , they probably had to be in their position . A sinful priest could say a good mass ; in fact , the eucharist shone all the brighter for it . The big thing now was those black angels oozing drunkenly around their bowl . Even Kevin seemed pleased  --  although Brian was on twenty-four-hour guard against being humored . Beatrice did n't mention the money . She made it sound as if they 'd gone to a regular doctor . " That 's very interesting , " said Kevin . " So polio is just a pain in the neck , eh ? " His way of not saying anything . Brian was afraid to test his father 's own neck , but real/ized , as suddenly , that he must . Maybe it was just men 's necks that contained sour lead : then another dream would be busted , and he did n't know where to turn for his next one . " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the table . It felt strange laying hands on his father 's throat . White , soft , unevenly shaved . Fumbling along the vein , he came to the spot right under the jaw . He 'd never touched his father 's neck before , or his chest for that matter . O.K. , here goes . He pressed and looked close into his father 's sweating face . Could he trust the old man to tell him the truth ? Kevin 's eyes were watery and bewildered . I 'll know a lie right away , from that source . " Is that it ? " asked Kevin . " That 's it . " " I did n't feel a thing . " O.K. , O.K.Memory was uncertain about the next bit . It was certainlyraining . His clothes were wet and heavy and hard to scrape off , even with the nurse hauling like a stevedore . They put him in a crisp white gown , tied at the back . Then he was walking up the stairs again  --  memory balking . He was scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of getting cured . He was scared of the moment when the strength would come snapping back . His memory stopped halfway ; better to climb stairs forever than face that moment.  |p114Beatrice  smiled like a madonna . She loved him , up there on his little cross . To get well one has to die . One of the few things he knew for sure . At the first sign of life , he would scream and tear his hair and rip off his genitals , for expiation . He would go helplessly insane , and the cure would be pointless . Schroeder moved around him quietly , muttering in German . Devil 's curses . Brian could n't see under the lee of his own chin , but suddenly he felt one of the leeches landing on him with iron pincers , and then another , and then by tipping his head slightly , he could see two whole black columns . They were motionless as death , except for the feel of their jaws . His mother sat , smiling hope . The doctor rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lasted . Rain fell on the grimy skylight , sometimes heavy , sometimes not . Dr. Schroeder went out to clean his bowl . Brian ignored the dull pain of being eaten and just concentrated on his legs . Would they come back gradually or did it all depend on some one gob of poison ? Sucked into a black jaw like a crumb off a carpet ? The gradual theory was slightly the less frightening ; but inch by inch , he had to give up on it . He stirred his legs gently from time to time , and Dr. Schroeder 's eyes would gleam , and the doctor and his mother would yearn at each other wetly  --  yes , yes , little Willie will walk  --  and Brian would think , It 's the hip , you idiots . Does n't anyone understand polio around here ? Schroeder 's tenderness made his big lips drip . Those were the slack moments , when the sweat turned cold and rusty in his crotch and his concentration snagged . When he felt that happening , he would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do it , I know this works . My mother 's neck , my father 's neck  --  he imagined blood vessels bursting in his forehead like light bulbs and his heart failing as the gauge on his willpower rose and the steam shot through his skull . Oh God , do it ! Just do it ! With Thy , Your , infinite power  --  so easy for You . Come on , then ! And then the first leech rolled off , in a blood-soaked stupor , and the next , and he knew it was all over . Christ ! What a farce . It 's not in the damn neck at all , everyone knows that . I knew it myself . Deliriously he tried to stand up , and another leech skittered to the floor . " Let 's get out of here , Mother , " he said hoarsely . " It may take a little time , " said Schroeder . " Call me again in about a week . " " What for ? " said Brian . " We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , we may . You fat fraud . You 're not putting those fucking things on me again . " " Brian ! " " Come on , Mother . Do n't give him any money . " It was a silly thing to say , but Schroeder chose to take it seriously . He stepped into the entrance of the cubicle and blocked it , and Miss Hoffman loomed up menacingly behind him , as if she 'd been listening for just this moment . " You better pay up , " he said in a gruff fury . Brian was dizzy : Germans could n't take a joke , he remembered . They were going to keep him here for experiments . It was a Nazi thing . Dirty white room reeling , hitting rock , sinking . His mother meekly unsnapping her purse , handing over bills.  |p116The  hand out , signaling , " More , more . " God knows how much she gave him . And still Schroeder raged . " Young punks , guttersnipes , " he said . He was crazy . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Tacky place to die . Brian tried to move in some unspecified way , and blackness came up like velvet from the back of his neck and smothered him gently . He remembered going home in terms of a vague rattling in vehicles , a hearse drawn through the sewers , M. le Blanc the headless coachman , and then his father shouting him awake from the next room . God what happiness in that voice . What could it possibly be saying ? " Damn charlatans . I promise we wo n't try anything like that again , Doctor . We must have been nuts . " And Dr. Devlin , the family doctor , famous for diagnosing everything as flu , said , " I should hope not . I only hope the boy does n't develop chronic anemia . His blood count is pretty low right now . " Brian realized that they had pricked his finger while he slept and taken out the last drop . That 's why he was dead . His mother said , " I still think it was worth trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then sounds of the doctor leaving . After which , the house was still . He 's glad , thought Brian , with the kind of clinical detachmentone needed for this . My father is glad it did n't work . Kevin Casey took his vacation at home that year . He told Beatrice that he could n't afford to take them anywhere ;  |p117he  also told her that anyone who called her daughters Beatrice and Portia was a goddamn snob . He did not bother to lower his voice , although Beatrice still kept her answers down . Aunt Portia made the mistake of showing up one afternoon , to see how Brian was doing . Kevin intercepted her in the living room . It was just more voices to Brian , who was dead , to all intents and purposes , in the next room , waiting to be taken away . The old Brian that you know and love , utterly dead , poor devil . He pictured his father sitting crumpled up under the fan with a bottle in front of him , like a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to sell him subscriptions . In fact , Kevin did say , " Have you brought your maga-zines ? " Portia 's answer was inaudible . The only person Brian really heard now was his father . " You have n't , eh ? How the hell am I going to keep up with the daring adventures of Dr. Steinmetz ? The last I remember , he was trapped in a cave with his chimpanzees , trying to collect specimens from them . Did he ever escape from the maddened beasts ? " Mumble . " Yeah , the only thing that guy Steinmetz lacked was imagination . You really should read about this fellow Dr. Blatherskite who collects hippopotamus droppings in his hat  --  that sounds a bit more like it , no ? Combined with the green mold in his ears , it produces the miracle elixir of the Indies . The health secret of the Aztecs , lost for centuries . "  |p118Brian  smiled . He 's talking to me , he thought . Making his case . The case for cynicism . Pretty good , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portia . I 'll never forget the way you used to give it to your pious sister Beatrice , for staying in the Catholic Church . Do n't you know that this crap you peddle now is twice as wild as anythingBeatrice ever bought ? Hell , you might as well have stayed in the Church yourself and saved yourself from becomingcompletely ridiculous . " The front door slammed . It made no difference . " Yeah , to practice elk spermism and be a skeptic too  --  that 's a bit greedy , do n't you think ? It seems to me the moment you left the Church , you began shopping around for any crutch that would hold you . Funny little twisty ones like Dr. Steinmetz . Rubber ones that bend when you walk . The Council of Trent designed better ones , believe me . . . " The bar was empty now in the long afternoon . He 'd chased them all away , all the outsiders who wanted a piece of the polio . The Englishman crumpled still further , now that no one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame you for being scared . It 's a scary business . Anything that helps  --  if it gets you to sleep on time , and if it keeps you from waking up crying  --  buy it , I say . I have my own little tricks . Oh yes , I do . " His voice sank , and Brian shut his eyes again . He liked it when his old man was being funny . He 's a bit like me then  --  well , no accident , I guess . You ca n't disown a man who gave you your point of view . But this soft boozy stuff did n't say anything to him at all . He opened his eyes ap119crack as Kevin said , louder , " But do n't cheapen the boy . Do n't bring your miserable spinster fears around here . He 's strong , strong in the spirit . " Ah , balls . Nobody 's strong when God swings the old wrecking ball . Brian was n't mad at his aunts . They could n't have done any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody , just very tired . His parents had probably given him all the love they knew how . Not very intelligently to be sure , but it would n't have made any difference . Thank you all , anyway . Now , please go away . He supposed they must be worrying about his apathy . That was probably why his father shouted so much . To all appearances , Brian must seem to be sleeping around the clock . He was n't really . He dozed and daydreamed as he had when he first got polio , a kind of second coming of it . Then in the eye of the fever , his mind would become classicallyabstract  --  all ideas , no pictures . He could face anything in that condition : he could face being blind and chained to a rock , to take one example that came to mind . The trick was to slip from that utter whiteness into soft black fantasy . No hanging around the twilight . Centuries passed in this way , and sometimes he imaginedhe was his own father sitting out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm not a bad man , I did n't do it to you . " Of course you did n't : it was just some little old bug doing God 's will . Nothing personal . I forgive me . His father stopped shouting at last . Brian heard his parents talking , quite sweetly now . He felt like Robinsonp120Crusoe waking from his storm , finding paradise . His father had returned to his religion , it seemed . Very nice . The very best crutches . Brian did n't want to think about anything in particular , so he kept his mind as vague as possible about this . When he returned to life , he would decide what he believed . But , luminous thought , he would never put it to the test . He would not under any circumstances go to Lourdes . No hurry to wake up . He still had years to serve in the Roman legions , after finishing his course with Socrates . He smiled peacefully when his parents came in , to reassure them . Honestly , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've taken up a lot of your time . Thank you all very much . " I think it 's mainly exhaustion . Salt Rock must have been a strain , and then this last thing . " " I blame myself for that . " " You really should n't . I went along with it . We had to try it . " There , you see , everyone 's forgiven . His parents were resting now like himself . They had always been a good couple , and were so again . The polio year had been a crazy time for everyone . Becoming an extremely old man was an excellent solution for his father . " And I still hope for a miracle , " said his mother . " So do I. I really do . " Right . But we wo n't put it to the test , will we ? Promise me that . Also  --  you 're both O.K. , really . His father sitting out there , like St. Joseph , keeping his sheepdogp121vigil ; his mother , dripping love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in fact . He smiled to say , Please do n't worry , I just want to sleep a few eons longer . Marcus Aurelius needs some advice . Flighty old bastard . Brian knew that when he woke up , he would be a cripple for sure . All the wisdom blew away in a moment , he felt it go , leaving only the words , like empty peanut shells . The conversation was still in progress out there , it had never stopped , but Bernie Levine had come in . That was strange . Bernie sounded excited . Which was very very strange . Bernie had been sent to wake him . " Now , would you mind repeating that , please , Bernie ? For my wife . " Why for his wife ? Where his wife before ? Brian wanted to know what everybody had been doing . " Mumbles is in the hospital . I was over at his parents ' place . They 're all shook up about it . " " And they 're sure he 's got it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may not even live . " " My God ! " said Beatrice . " That 's terrible ! " " I 'm scared , " whimpered Bernie . " I was with him all summer practically . Just like I was with Brian last summer . " Maybe your luck will hold , " said Kevin , with the cool voice of the polio veteran . My voice . " What 's the matter with Brian ? " asked Bernie . " Is hep122O.K. ? " Somebody better be O.K. , or Bernie go nuts around here . " I think so . He 's had a temperature for three days . And you know , we actually thought he might have caught polio again , he had all the same symptoms . But it turns out you ca n't catch polio twice . " " Huh . " " He seems to be getting better now , " said Beatrice . " His temperature 's down  --  " a pointless lie , nobody had taken his temperature  --  " Dr. Devlin is a bit at sea with unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the common cold , " said Kevin , quite his old self . " But tell us more about Fatso . " Fatso ! So that was it ! Brian woke all the way now , tinglingwith joy . Fatso had polio ! It was like the first spring flower . " Father O'Monahan was over there , talking to the Hennessys , " said Bernie . " I guess he was trying to console them . " " Ah yes , " said Kevin . " Yes , he does that . " " Brian 'll be sorry to hear about it , " said Beatrice . Sorry ? She could n't believe that , could she ? Now that he had a companion ? Now that he might get Bernie too , and how many more ? The all-polio world , which was second-bestto a cure . It took him a moment to imagine any sense in which he could possibly be sorry for this . Then slowly he groped his way back to normal thinking : it must be tough on Hennessy 's folks , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice.  |p123Thank  you for seeing it my way , Father . Beatrice sounded genuinely concerned , she was a finer character than they were . Finer , yet colder . The true feeling now was to rejoicejust a little bit : not to sympathize whorishly with any damn fool who walked in the door , bleating about someone'stroubles . Bernie left , a haunted man , on the run from house to house  --  ha , ha ! It 'll get you , Bernie . God has X-ray vision and can see through any fig leaf . Kevin came in and said , " Hey , you 're awake . Hey , he 's awake . " Beatrice came in , too , and clapped her hands like a girl . Who would have thought a year ago that they 'd settle for this , to celebrate over . " Did you hear us talking about Fatso ? " Brian nodded , weaker than he thought . " It 's terrible , is n't it ? " said Beatrice . " Yes , it 's terrible . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A while after that , Kevin put on some records , including his collection of Irish jigs , and he and Beatrice did a couple of steps , the way they used to do them at the Irish Reeling Society before Brian had ever been thought of.  | " Pick ' em up , Casey . " His friend Baxterter pranced a few yards ahead , clearingthe snow like King Wenceslas . " They must be hangin ' mighty low today , Big Casey . " " Fuck you , " muttered Brian , stumbling along behind as fast as he could , snagging his legs against the drifts . " What 's that you say , Casey ? Did n't quite catch you . " " I said , doan whip me , massah . " They were just far enough apart for bystanders to overhear them , and Brian was n't free to speak his mind . The snow presented certain technical difficulties : layers of hard and soft resisting one leg and yielding smoothly to the other , coaxing him into a splitting skid . Meanwhile , Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p125Brian  could n't move fast enough to silence his friend withoutenlarging the risk about ten percent on each step . Just too much . Passersby frowned at Baxter and his cripplebaiting , but Baxter was hard to penetrate . " In the meadow we can build a snowman , " he crooned . " Doan whip me , doan beat me . " Brian surged forward , to get past a staring middle-aged couple : a salaciously tender lady and her utterly fair-play husband . Too fast . His crutch hit an ice sheet and shot out in front of him . He grabbed the other one and furled himself gallantly round it , like a marine at Iwo Jima , and slowly the crutch and he flopped sideways into the snow . " Are you all right ? " The lady was upon him . Oh God , in a moment she 'd try hauling him up by the armpits , and her husband would start hauling her by the armpits , and they 'd all wind up in the snow . By dusk , the sidewalk would be littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Baxter . " Some days , they just hang a little heavy , and down he goes . He likes to play , you understand . " Brian knew them by heart . He was a Columbia teacher . She belonged to interfaith organizations . They wanted to help everybody and they did n't want to interfere with anybody . So they rushed up to you and then they just stood there . " Why do you want to embarrass me ? " Baxter asked Brian . " Have you ever tried to analyze it ? " Yeah . The couple wanted to protest brutality , but supposethey were witnessing some kind of folk custom here ?  |p126They  were pathetic . " Look , please go away , O.K. ? " Briantold them , " I think your marriage can be saved , but it 'll need work . Besides , I 'm tied up right now . " There 's no helping some people , is there , Percy ? They did n't get angry , but seemed to enter new zones of indecisiveness . Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've given you something to think about , eh madam ? Brian went hobbling off with Baxter , leaving them standing there . Polio in New York . An old lady grabbing you round the chest from behind , trying to help you across the street . The zest of hitting her in the ankle . The cry of " watchit " just after he 'd fallen ; the chorus of " take it easy 's " as he lay spraddled . Baxter was O.K. , when you considered the alternatives . Even in a snowstorm . His teasing was tiresome , but better than nothing . The rest of their friends in the freshman class had walked on ahead for various reasons . It physicallyhurt some people to walk slowly . And , out here by himself in the slippery wastes , he would have been at the mercy of roving bands of do-gooders . " You remind me of a friend I used to have , guy named Marconi , " said Brian . " It 's all part of a pattern of rotten luck that has dogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He went to M.I.T. I must admit , old Phil surprised me with that . He wants to be an engineer . He never said any/thing about engineering before , but now it 's all he talks about . " " Yeah ? How come he 's like me then ? What sterling qualities of his are you keeping from me ? " " Phil likes to crap all over everything . He 's a real cynic . Or at least he used to be . Now he 's very polite about anything you say . No more jokes . I do n't know what happened to him . " High-school cynics must peak too soon . Marconi had sunk into himself for the last year of high school , as if life were just too unbearably sad . He stayed home all day and would n't answer the phone . Then he emerged with this thing on engineering . " Funny how people change , " Brian said . " This Marconi was a real bastard , I thought I could count on him to be a bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , something beastly like that . Then we had this other friend  --  am I boring you ?  --  named Fatso Hennessy , who got polio the year after I did , only worse . They got him in an iron lung in Colorado and there he sits . Well , it may be a coincidence , but Marconi went into his decline just about then . He never even liked Fatso before that , but now he writes him once a week , and last summer he went all the way out there to visit him . " " What secrets lurk in the hearts of men ? " " Damn right . Marconi took my polio in his stride , you 'll notice . But when his enemy got it , he was overcome with guilt . " " Obviously wanted to kill the bugger . Feels responsible.  |p128Sim|ple  transfer of his own self-hatred onto surrogate sibling , tweet tweet . Hence , no more need to be cynical , eh , my dear Sigmund ? " " You 're a pisser , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this English thing from the Jack Paar radio show , and Brian found it suited him uncommonly well . Marconi was one part of a past that had died just like that . Brian saw none of his old friends now . That last year , clomping around Conception , was like a party that should have ended sooner . He had studied like a maniac the summerafter Salt Rock to keep it from being two years , and by the blowsy standards of Conception he was more than ready to graduate . The first day back , he wobbled into class and was given a standing ovation . He did n't know what damn fool started it  --  some of the guys seemed embarrassedat joining in at first , which made him feel just marvelous , and then nobody knew when to quit . He decided that that dewy-eyed little creep Flynn might be behind it . One of nature 's ass-kissers . Talk to him later . Break his legs and give him something to cry about . Griffin looked at Mulholland  --  I ' 11 stop if you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't clap for me , you bastards . Flynn kept it up several seconds . The rest had subsided . And Father Quinn had a special glint in his eye , as if maybe he 'd given the order . Subsequently , Brian was asked in due succession to run for class president and valedictorian and to edit the yearbookand all the meaningless shit a cripple can apparentlyp129claim by right . He began to wonder if every victory in life was going to be stained by pity , or was that a special Conceptionproblem ? He was the only guy in school who 'd caught last year 's blight , which made him some kind of a totem or scapegoat , the one chosen to suffer for the school 's sins . He was even voted most popular , even though he went home early every day and had no social life at all . He was n't popular , just respected . It was a bitter , lonely year that he was never to talk about much . He swore then and there that he would never take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize for dwarfs and the half-blind , was not for him ; though he could n't help winning the state Latin prize . O.K. , Lazarus  --  you 're on your own this year . A new life , starting from scratch , with people who had never known him in the old days and who were free to hate him on his merits . Marconi , mourning over Fatso 's iron coffin , could watch over the past for both of them . Brian had slipped out of the coffin and was alive . Well anyway , not to be too melodramatic about it  --  he could n't very well make a fuss over Fatso , could he ? It was like two ladies coming to a party in the same dress . " To get back to serious matters , " said Baxter , " what about the party Saturday ? " " I still have n't got a date . Joanie Finch was , it seemed , otherwise occupied . "  | " Yeah , she usually is . Kind of the way France was occupied . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nancy was the most beautiful freshmanat Barnard , homecoming-queen material and rumored to be something of a genius on the side . " Why not ? She likes you . I mean , she kept smiling at you , that time at the West End . " " She was drunk . " " To be sure . Still , in vino much good nooky , remember that . The guy with her had to drag her away , and she was still smiling at you , by God . " " Yeah , well that was nice of her . " Brian could n't explain , it broke the code , that a smile at me is different from a smile at you . He knew a motherly simper when he saw one ; yet he must pretend now to discuss it in a sexual light . As if to give the only answer he knew , he slipped again in the snow and lay there : you see ? This is our little problemright here . " Goddamnit , Casey , have n't you embarrassed me enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lined him up over his crutches . " Now I just happen to have Nancy 's phone number on me . Just one of my services . Why do n't you give her a tinkle on the blower , old bean ? " This British thing had all the makings of being a real drag . " I 'll think about it . She should be able to fit me in some time next April . " " She can fit you in any time , big Casey . " Goddamn therapy . Now you see , Baxter here is trying to make me feel like one of the boys . It 's nice to have a friend who 'll dop131that , but he must be made to understand it is n't necessary . I have my own methods . Someday I will win a beautiful woman by brute achievement . There are women like that , who 'll sleep with a hunchback if he 's in Who 's Who . And , of course , as women get older they are less fussy . But right now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be turned down , with the sickliest of regrets , and I will have that much less confidence for next time . He sat , now , with his hand on the phone : not sure how he had got here . Anyway , this is as near as I should get . She did smile at me , and there was probably a tiny bit of sex in it , and that 's fine . Now let 's concentrate on becomingrich and famous . The women will beat a path to my door . Spoiled empty women with great bodies . He was crouched on the edge of his bed . Very convenient , being able to live at home . Also , very constricting . ( If I ca n't dance , I 'm damned if I 'll do dishes , was his motto . ) Where would he bring his women , as the years went by ? Oh Mother , how you surprised us . I was just showing Miss Selfridge my ulterior tibia . . . All this is gettingus nowhere . He had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? At the West End , you say ? Yes , of course . I have black hair , a thin Irish face . Surely you 'd remember a man like that ? . . . With Ted Baxter , eh ? How is old Ted ? Ted 's in wonderful shape , thank you . Absolutely prime . . . I 'd love to get together some time . This Saturday ? I 'm afraid not . Next Saturday , I 'm afraid not . He 'd lose more confidence if he did n't make the phone call . She could n't insult him as much as he insulted himself.  |p132Anyhow  , at least it would sound better in her voice . He braced himself and spun the dial . " Nancy ? " " Who is this ? " That was n't such a hot voice . " It 's Brian Casey . I met you at the West End . I have a bad leg . " " Who do you want ? " The voice was actually quite hideous . " You mean you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see if she 's here . " Grunt . He tried to force himself to see the funny side . But why did he have to mention the bad leg ? Did he think it would be good for at least one date ? Goddamnit , Casey , do n't do that again . " Hello ? " " Hello , Nancy ? " " Yes ? " " This is Brian Casey . I met you at the West End . " " Yes , Brian . " " Er , are you doing anything Saturday night ? " " Well , sort of . " " That 's too bad . " " What were you , I mean , what ? " she fluttered . " I was going to ask you to a party at the Sigma Gamma house . " " Well  --  I might be able to fit that in . What time ? " " I do n't know . Late I guess . " Holy mother of peace , he 'd got her . " I 'll call you back , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " All right . I 'm pretty sure I can make it . And , Brian , thanks for asking . " Hot spit . Double hot spit . Nancy Selfridge . Jesus , the guys at the frat house would be creaming themselves . While the telephone fever was on him , he dialed Baxter and a couple of other guys over at Butler and asked them round for a little beer and poker . Nancy Selfridge  --  mmmmm . He kissed his fingers and waved them at the crowd . The guys from Butler were more than impressed , they were in shock . " Nancy Selfridge ? The blonde ? How do you rate , Casey ? " " God 's gift to women , " said Baxter . " She was warm for Casey 's form the moment she clapped eyes on the little fellow . " " Please do n't use that word clap , ' it makes me nervous . " " Nancy Selfridge , huh ? " Fellow named Harris . Iowa or someplace . " Oh well , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly clutches his throat and screams . " Nancy Selfridge ! Did you say Nancy Selfridge ? Mother of God  --  Nancy Selfridge ? " " O.K. , you want to play cards ? " asked Brian . It was too much . What was he going to do with this extraordinary woman ? He had n't been on a real date since he got polio and could n't even remember what you talked about . " I do n't think I 'm in any shape to play poker , " said Wendell , Massachusetts . " I think I 'll lie down for a little while . Nappy poos . " " I hate to harp on this , " said Harris , " but does n't she go with Lundy on the football team ? "  | " She used to until Casey came along , " said Baxter . " Geez , you stole a girl from Lundy ? What a man . " " Just tell me this , " said Wendell , from the sofa . " Do you think she puts out ? " " Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Baxter . " Wendell , you 'll be working the West End for the rest of your days . Do you mean does she occasionally favor some lucky mortal with her celestial attentions ? " Thoughtfulpause . " Perhaps , perhaps . " " I asked you guys here to play poker , not to cream yourselvesover my date . " " Oh , I misunderstood , " said Baxter . " You really want to play poker , huh ? " They played for nickels and dimes , but Brian went at it as grimly as he would have for a fortune . " Geez , Casey , we do n't raise that much around here . " " Why not ? " he said . Harris shrugged . " We just do n't . " Brian shrugged back . What fun was it if you pussyfooted with this game , if you did n't get right up to the edge of panic ? He was about to say , It 's my house and we 'll play my rules , when he saw that Harris was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on him . " O.K. , O.K.  --  what 's the limit ? Fifty cents ? " Fucking sewing circle . " We do n't have a special limit . You know , you just do n't push a guy . " Brian almost threw down his cards . What the hell is the point of the game if you just do n't push a guy ? But he did n't want them to leave . So for a few hands he tried playing their soft , second-rate way.  | " You 're too good for me , Casey , " Harris said anyway . " I never played with a shark before . " " Yeah , where 'd you learn this game ? I mean which Hong Kong whorehouse ? " " I 'm just getting good hands . " Poker was the excuse that kept them here , yet he could see they did n't really like it . Brian was wretched , not going for the jugular . He would rather just talk , in that case . But he would play on their terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You want me to lend you some money ? " " No , thanks . I got to work anyway . " " Me too , I got a test tomorrow . " " Come on . One more hand . " He dealt quickly , though it was n't his turn . They looked at their cards listlessly . They might not like poker , but losing flustered and depressed them , like anyone else . Brian looked at what he had dealt himself  --  goddamnit , he 'd come up with a full house . All right , he would n't play it . He 'd turn it in without a word . " Casey ? " " A dime , I guess . " He could n't do it , just could n't . Try altering your poker game , go on . It 's like altering your face or your attitude to money . Baxter raised him foolishly  --  please , Ted , do n't say it so casually . That means you 've got nothing , right ? Harris 's cards fanned wearily across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , you can still do the same , Casey . Fold quietly and treat your friend Baxter to a moment of happiness . Wendell was already on his way out.  | " I guess I 'd better see you , Ted . " I 'm sorry , I ca n't let you think you got away with it , can I ? You can keep the money of course . In a minute they were all gone , and Brian was left with his pile of coins and IOU 's , and two halfemptyquart bottles of Ballantine.  |p137To  keep Saturday night at bay , Brian logged some time over at the library . He would never have expected it , he was n't really the type , but books had become a great narcotic for him  --  Dickens , my God , what a writer , Balzac , Arnold Bennett : anyone who conveyed that the world was big and complicatedas hell . The assigned work of a Columbia freshmanwas so simple and dull that it gave him ungovernable erotic fantasies ; so he dipped outside his field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was like meeting a dirty old man outside school : peddling the heroin of Atheism , as Father O'Monahan might say , through the needle of Doubt . " Can you prove that you exist ? " he asked his mother , as she made his bed that Friday morning.  | " Of course I can . You can see me , ca n't you ? " " Yes , Mother . Of course . That 's right . " Try it on Father . He may see the problem a little more clearly . " Do you know that you ca n't really prove God 's existence ? " he said , over supper . " Yes you can , " said Beatrice . " Ca n't you , dear ? " Kevin gave her a look . Who me ? " That 's right , " he said . " St. Thomas does it at least five ways . There 's first cause , and there 's the argument from design , and I forget the other three . Was it a priori ? Something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take first cause . David Hume really destroyed that one . He said that the concept cause and effect ' is just a series of observations . It 's just  --  " " Did you learn that at Columbia ? " said Beatrice , who had argued against a secular college in the first place . " That 's just clever-clever , " said Kevin , prodding at his mackerel : the proof from fish , that 's the one he 'd forgotten . " Maybe I ca n't prove cause and effect , but every damn fool knows that it 's there . " " Do they just teach you to doubt everything over there ? " said Beatrice . " Good grief , they do n't even teach you that much , " said Brian . " I got this from Bertrand Russell 's book . " " Is n't he the man with three wives ? " said Kevin . " I do n't know . It 's not the most important thing about him . " " Well , it 's good to know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord Russell is an aristocrat whop139does n't take anything seriously . I believe he even raised his own children in the nude at one time . Can you imagine him with his pipe and all , and not a stitch on ? " " Are n't we getting away from the point ? " " Not really . Do I have to tell you why that kind of man would love to prove that God does n't exist ? You and I are not really equipped to deal with these ideas philosophically , but it 's enough for Lord Russell 's purposes that some doubt is cast on them . It 's like hearing a rumor about a famous person . You 're never quite sure afterward ... " Beatrice looked at her husband with relish . You see ? He can handle anything you pick up at that Columbia of yours . Brian did n't push it  --  he 'd forgotten how bog-Irish his parents were in this respect . They read The New Yorker and went to the theater ; but when it came to the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he certainly did n't want to wind up going to Holy Cross or someplace to have his faith restored . If the religion issue led to that , to hell with it . He tried to snuff it out gently , leaving no trace . " I certainlydid n't mean that Russell disproves God  --  if you ca n't prove God , you ca n't disprove him either . It 's a matter of faith , is n't it ? " Scripsi scriptum credo creditum fortiter ludere possum : translated , let 's have the conversation in Latin so we wo n't shock Mother . " The Church insists it 's also a matter of Reason , " his father said doggedly . Since his own brief lapse of faith , he had become your basic devout Catholic , duty-bound to instruct anyone who did n't set the dogs on him first.  | " Yeah , well , it could be . I mean , like I was saying this morning , you ca n't prove that you exist either , but it 's not unreasonable to believe that you do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice . Now that no loss of faith seemed to be involved , she quickly lost interest . " It 's good to come in contact with the best secular thought , if you 're properly trained for it , as I think Brian is . It can even strengthen your faith . " Kevin was still selling Columbia , which he really believed in . " Half my class at Georgetown left the Church . " The conversation was aesthetically painful . His parents ' religion embarrassed him , like bad singing . Religion took talent . " I 've got a date Saturday night , " he said abruptly . Is she a Catholic girl ? His mother did n't ask that , of course , though his grandmother would have . Each generationslipped a little more into the bog of indifference . " That 's nice . Do we know her ? " " No . " It 's not Mary Murphy , who wheeled me around the high-school prom , if that 's what you mean . It 's a real girl this time . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was up to it . No , on second thought , he definitelydid n't want to know . His parents ' view of him would be misleading , and unlike anyone else 's . His mother still acted as if he could n't use the telephone : she called the dentist for him and the brace man . She would picture his date as fundamentally a problem in nurse 's training . His father  --  ah , who knew what his father thought ?  | " So I 'll be home late . " " How are you going to get back ? " " Ted Baxter 'll take care of me . " Better to lean on a friend than a parent : a step toward maturity . " Are you sure you 'll be all right ? I mean Ted Baxter does n't get drunk , does he ? " " Brian can take care of himself , " said Kevin . " That is as long as he does n't get drunk . " That was flattering . Now let 's not talk about it any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never grow up if you keep discussing important things with your parents . That night , he stayed awake war-planning tomorrow night with Nancy Selfridge . Did non-Catholic girls like that expect you to sleep with them on their first date ? To judge from his friends ' conversation , some of them did . How to tell which ones ? And how much allowance must be made for routine bullshit on part of friends ? Probably less in college than in high school . His new friends seemed more honest in other respects . Sex different ? We 'll see . Next question : assuming the best  --  where would they go to do it ? Not here for sure . He had heard about seductions at the frat house , but could n't imagine where they occurred . Check it out with Baxter . Maybe he knows a hotel . God , Casey , you 're a cold , scheming son of a bitch . He could n't even remember what Nancy looked like , and here he was booking her into cheap hotels , frugeling her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not go into detailsor we 'll be up all night . Must n't leave game in locker room . I 'm not really cold  --  quite the opposite . Have to keepp142it impersonal or I wo n't be able to handle it at all . Religious considerations ? I 'll be the judge of that . I do n't think I owe God any favors , after what he did to me . That 's selfpity , Casey  --  maybe polio was a blessing in disguise . Yeah , some disguise . No , I mean it  --  you 're twice as smart as you would have been without it . Look at all the reading you got done . You could almost pass for an intellectual in certainobtuse circles . Also , this may be useful , people do n't envy you . O.K. , we 'll call that a tie . But please , do n't send round fat eunuchs like O'Monahan to tell me what 's what . It is well known that the Irish are scared of sex and make some big virtue out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sack-a you go , big boy . And ask her if she 's got a friend . Would he ? That sounds glib . Did you learn it at Columbia ? Anyway , as to confession , uhuh , I 'm not tellingmy sex life to some prissy old lady in a cassock .. . glib , but I do know more about God than O'Monahan does . I 've been touched by His hand . And I know one thing He does n't do  --  He does n't cure polio . Look , we alreadydiscussed that . His mysterious ways and all that  --  you bet they 're mysterious . My father really agrees with me about God . Who knows what your father thinks ? Not even your father . Some steel door closed in the middle of his mind . Behind the door , green greasy alligators , like everyone else . Will I give a good account of myself withNancy ? WILL I GIVE A GOOD ACCOUNT OF MYSELF ? Not yet , you fool . Down boy . Oh my . Three hours ' sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just spend a normal day , now . You 're not seventeenp143any more . You 're , my God , almost , well , it 's an improvement , nineteen . Old enough to drink and fight for your country . Let 's have a little suave around here . By afternoon , he was sexually exhausted . It had leaked away like gas . Another shave , another tub . He sought refuge in grooming : hosing down the old armpits , what ? Or how about a dab of after-shave in the groin ? it ca n't hurt . . . Ouch , it certainly can . What more can I do to enhance my loveliness ? He sat on the toilet seat , bathed in steam , and thought , oh my God , another problem  --  how do I get a you know ? Ask Baxter for one ? It could be the social gaffe of the year . " Hey guys ! "  --  Baxter was no man to keep these things to himself . " Casey wants a tweet ! He thinks he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How about one of the guys at Butler ? Same objection . Goddamn , he wished he knew what was expected of him . The only alternative was to get on over to the drugstore , slipping up-ice on ii6th Street , and just ask for one . You think going to confession is difficult , you should try this . " That 'll be , er , three Trojans please . " And five Hail Marys . He swore he would not let the religious thing get to him again , but then he thought of the slimy rubber things strewn like leaves under the hedges in the park , ten Our Fathers ' worth in each of them , the wages of sin . That 's just an aesthetic matter , not materially affecting the gravitas peccati one way or the other . ( They put the dirty parts of the moral theology book in Latin , the greatestspur to learning ever devised . ) Now , then . Questionp144for our experts : is Trojan a brand name , or is it generic ? " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you personally recommend there . . . " Would the druggist sympathize with his flounderings ? Did druggists have a code like priests and doctors ? Levine worked in a drugstoreone summer , and he was pretty funny about the customers who wound up ordering toothpaste or Bromo out of very embarrassment . So it seemed there was no code . He could imagine some kid like Levine regaling his friends : " Yeah , this guy came in , all tripped up  --  and he did n't even know you have to have a marriage certificate . Yeah , and not only that , but he did n't know you have to be individually measured for them ! " To hell with the Trojans , they were sinful anyway . Maybe one more shave would help . He had been in the bathroom over two hours , and twice he had heard polite footsteps outside . His parents never bothered him in here , but they would have to use the place sometime . He decided to skip the shave and take his chances on that rugged look . Instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him : " You mean you have n't got one ? " " I just happen to be a Catholic . " " Well why the hell did n't you tell me ? " The screaming woman in the bushes . " Send me one of your friends , at once . " All right , he 'd get one . Three ? Was he up to three ? Or did you use them more than once ? He was beginning to feel like an old rubber himself , foul and crawling , dis/carded by man and God . His precious seed flowing into the city sewer , where it belonged . What a joke to think he could do this lightly , with his training . Grimly he set out for the store and barked his order for three male contraceptives , and was handed them without incident . He could barely croak out a " hello " when he finally saw her . She kept him waiting in the dim lobby of the girls ' dormitory , and he spent the time reminding himself that sex would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relief , she seemed to expect to do all the preliminarytalking . " I hope this kind of dress is all right . You did n't tell me what kind of party it was . " The dress looked O.K. to him . He did n't know what kind of party it was ; a track suit would probably do splendidly for the Si Gam . " Black is usually all right anywhere , " she said . " But I 'll die if I 'm the only one in a cocktail dress . " She was supposed to be smart , she looked smart . Maybe she 'd stop crapping around in a minute . " How are we getting there ? " she asked . " Friend has a car . " It was only a few blocks , but he did n't wish to impress his date with one of his twenty-foot slides onto the trolley tracks . So he had badgered Baxter into getting out his heap . It was n't a bad car , actually  --  the thing about Baxter was that he was rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about . " Hold on to the door , Nancy  --  it has a nastyp146way of flying off . Messy business . I 'll work the siren . The rest of you dogs , get out and push . With any luck , we 'll make it . " This stuff would keep them occupied while he wriggled into his seat . " Hey Baxter , I can get you fifty big ones for this . I have connections at the city dump . No ? You Armenians are a proud little people . . . " Nobody was laughing , not even Baxter . To begin with , this was not Marconi 's uncle 's Chevy , but a brand new Oldsmobile 88 . Also , possibly , Baxter did not laugh after dark . Brian suddenly felt highschool : on his last date , two years ago , insulting the car was just the thing . Nancy started up again , asking whether he came from the city , and whether Baxter came from the city , and Baxter 's girl Perry , who came from the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the city herself , especially the crisp clear days and the tingle in the air . Shut up , you dumb broad . How could you become sexually aroused by such bullshit ? She sounded like a housewife from New Jersey . The gorgeous body was just something she was passing through . " I grew up in New York , " said Brian , " to the crisp clear sounds of , Outta my way kid , straighten them papers , put that back or I 'll kill you . ' You know , from those picturesque little guys who run our quaint cigar stores , and those colorfultaxi drivers of ours . By the way , have you noticed that all cigar-store owners are exactly the same height ? " No response . This was a guttersnipe approach to a glamorous evening , was it not . Baxter said that they wouldp147ruin the skyline if they put up a U.N . building here . Out of sheer nervousness , Brian said he thought the skyline was overrated . They arrived at the Sigma Gamma house and Baxter let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a parking place . Baxter looked stern as a judge in the dashboardlight . Better shape up , Casey . Brian was n't strictly a member , but a regular guest of Baxter 's . Nobody else knew quite what to do with him . Boy , I certainly messed up in the car , he thought , as he hoicked up the stairs . You know what it is ? I 'm not a gentleman . That 's what it is , Master Pip , right enough . He guessed they had located the heart of the party . At least , this was the room where they had shown the stag movies last week and he had almost fainted . But was this all ? just couples necking to old Artie Shaw records ? Somebodyedged silently along on the sofa , leaving a space for Nancy and him . Should he apologize to Nancy ? I mean , she must have expected a real party , not just notes for a party . " What are you drinking ? " asked Baxter , who had followedthem up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tsk , tsk . Perhaps our wild Irish friend will change your mind about that . " He winked at Brian . " How about you , tiger ? " " I guess I 'll have a rye and ginger ale . " " You 're kidding . " " I am ? "  | " Yes , you are . Believe me . " Maybe if I was standing up , I could hit him with my good hand , or kind of fall on top of him . But he 'll be long gone by the time I 'm up . " All right , get me the correct thing , Mr. Taste . And make it snappy . " What gets into these Baxter-type guys after dark ? In the daytime , he 's a bum like everybody else . But at night , voila , pussycat . Brian found himself watching closely : would he bring him a frozen daiquiri or a pink lady ? Or maybe a mango chutney frappe ? Baxter brought him a Scotch and water , and went over to an adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Jesus , there was nothing special about that . Anyone can be a gentleman , if that 's all it takes . Nancy looked up at him with sultry eyes . How 'd she manage that ? The housewife saucers had narrowed miraculously . She had left her Sunday-go-to-meeting manners in the car . " You 're a strange boy , " she said ; so help him , that 's what she said . " Ah , you 'd noticed , " he shot back . " You 're laughing at me . I can tell . " Although the couples each acted as if they were alone under the stars , they must have been aware of each other , because they seemed to move in unison . Signals ran along the sofa cushions  --  Brian felt like the first day of dancing school . Should he start to neck now ? He 'd forgotten the little he knew.  |p149Last  week , this same crowd had whistled and popped its cheeks over " The Randy Desk Clerk . " " My ma gave me a nickel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum , chew-chew-chew chewing gum , " was how they greeted the act of fellatio . The air still carried traces of it : the cheap hotel room , actors made of grey genital , yipping students . The real business of sex , not this garden-party crap . " I 'm not laughing at you , I 'm laughing with you , honey , " he said . A certain amount of talking seemed necessary , any old crap would do . At what point in the inanities they should begin to neck he 'd better leave to her , he guessed . " Do you laugh at a lot of people ? " she murmured . " Just the funny ones , " he murmured back . " Please . Be serious . Brian . " " I 'm trying . It 's not easy . " Not easy for her , either . She straightened up and reached for a cigarette . Her face hardened to flint as she squinted over the flame : hey , that 's good , hold it . Brassy , tough platinum blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in the car , squealing over crisp autumn days , and not True Romance rushing Joe College at the frat house , but the real lowdown thing . " I 'm serious now , " he said , and pulled her closer with his good arm . " Now , " he repeated , and pressed hard on her mouth , not kissing , just pressing , until their teeth clanged . Her arms tensed , as if to push him off , but then she seemed to resign herself to it : it was part of the deal , the dating contract , putting up with the occasional gorilla . Do n't do me any favors , he thought . He pulled backp150slightly himself , embarrassed at the amateur lunge , and came back more smoothly . She stroked his hair in return , content now with this slumberous compromise , and very sweet it was for a while , her mouth working gently against his , and her body softer than dreams . But did one go on like this all night ? His back hurt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like carving a roast . " How far 'd you get Saturday night ? " He knew the Monday talk . " You get the tit ? Outside tit or inside ? Just the bra , huh ? " He decided he 'd better push on . She let his hand linger on her breast for just a moment , his trophy for Monday . ( " You did n't have to pin her , I trust . " " Are you kidding ? The price of my pin is complete surrender . " ) Not bad for a first date with a campus queen , but suddenly not good enough . Brian played to win . He put the hand back quite sharply and held on  --  not , he realized , enjoying it all that tremendously . It was too much like clinging to a rock . Outside tit ? O.K. Not bad , Casey . Would n't let you go any further , eh ? He understood that you were a damn pantywaist if you stopped before they ordered you to . So he plunged his hand into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the nipple itself . Eureka , guys . Plant the flag . She was looking up at him , unresisting . " Did you just want that ? " she asked . He held it lifelessly , pointlessly . The bra rasped against his hand so he could n't circulate it . Meanwhile , the others necked on obliviously , still as statues , knowing better thanp151to do that sort of thing in here . He 'd made a damn fool of himself . Nancy 's eyes were big again , with sexless pity . Little boy did n't know what he was doing . She had let him have the breast , like a child . He disentangled his hand , and for a second he could have hit her with it . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " It 's all right , " he said . " I like you an awful lot , " she said . " I 'll bet you do , " he said . They could n't start necking again . She was an expertin these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Since thirteen she had known how not to hurt a guy 's feelings , how to keep his respect , the exact inch of terrain to surrender each time out . She even knew how she wanted to be talked about on Mondays . That whore look was no accident . " Come on , I 'll get you a taxi , " he said . Too embarrassed to look at her , obscurely angry : yet some dirty little part of him still wanted to impress her . " It did n't work out too well . I tried to work too fast . " One of his rare mistakes , gracefully acknowledged . " You 're too attractive for your own good . " She did n't say anything . They went down the stairs and got her coat . She looked sad and more human than before , with none of her fixed faces  --  though perhaps that , too , was fixed . " The human look can be obtained by  --  " They could n't find a cab , of course , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both wanted to get out of , but they had to walk slowly . He concentrated maniacally on not falling : that would be the living kiss-off end . At her front door , she kissed him quickly on the cheek and ran in . People Will Always Be Kindp152To hell with her . End of that . Of course , he would n't tell anyone about the tit ; could n't really imagine why people did . He walked a few steps , and flung the three condoms far away into the snow.  |p153He  spent Sunday morning in church , to clear his mind . The droning incantationsof the crowd at Corpus Christi ( where they dialoguedthe mass in English ) and the inscrutable dance of the priest might fashion him a mood . Despair was out of the question , he 'd come too far for that . How about becoming a recluse like Marconi ? Phil had one invaluable secret : he knew that the examined life was a pile of shit . It was just too all-round embarrassing : you did n't have to be crippled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amazing spiritual gifts . A rancid saint . Would probably be a priest if it did n't require some faith . Phil had barely enough of that for engineering . It would be nice to escape the world of bodies somehow , of clumsiness and sympathy . To become a superbrain inp154a glass bowl , feared by earthpeople . Hated by earthpeople . Or Christ up there , cursed and despised of men . Bleeding to death , and still man enough to be despised every inch of the way . To be so strong and make such a statement that , if you were dead in a ditch with your legs and arms beside you , people would spit on you . That was manhood for the handicapped . Brian ate his crippled friend at communion with shudderingrelish and stayed all morning to watch the repeated sacrifice . By the ten o'clock mass , he could almost imagine the priest 's face , twisted in a smirk , as he slammed his switchblade into the Host . This is the God for me : a God who would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitied . He even hired these priests , his own blessed goon squad , to sacrifice him around the clock . Of course , the old ladies tried to pity him . Easy for them  --  they had n't been there . They knew not what they did . The hypnosis was working : the pounding disharmonies of those flat Columbia-area voices , like waves that could n't get together , would have him levitating and jabbering Latin in no time . Christ , of course , would n't be seen dead in this place : He 's dead drunk out in the snow right now . Spitting rainbows of blood . If you want me , that 's where you 'll find me , madam . In fact , that 's the only place you 'll find me . You do n't fancy me , eh , with the tubes sticking up my nose and that hole in my throat ? Pity . Because no man goeth to the Father , except through me . That 's it , brother . Right through that hole in my throat.  |p155No  , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at how I talked to Pontius Pilate just now . And the women of Jerusalem . " Weep not for me , but for yourselves and your children . " I do n't want your pity , ladies . Go home and tremble for yourselves . I get along very nicely . I am broken , you see . Nothing more can happen to me . Baxter , over there in the crowd  --  now that 's a different case . How would you like to be broken , my good man ? We 'll see when the time comes . And why it 's Selfridge , the town whore , I 've always liked whores . Oh , not that way , believe me ; not the way you think . I know too much . Procreation is a nasty business . I sometimes wish I 'd never invented it . But when a customer ignores them afterward , that 's different . Now that 's real feeling . Like mine . Yes , a whore laughed at , or pelted with rocks , that 's God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , you fat fools , weep for yourselves . It was the last mass , one-ten , and Brian had arrived beyondwords at a still scene in a meadow where Christ sat calmly buffing his nails while his tormentors wailed and thrashed . Cut off your legs and follow me . We ca n't , Lord , we just ca n't . Imagine asking this guy for a cure : he 'd send you something worse , with his blessings . Cautiously , now , let us return to this prosy old church , bumping down on the black-and-white landing strip . Whether these thoughts he 'd been having were blasphemy , he really did n't know , or even if they had any connection with the Christian religion . They were his religion , he knew that for sure , and he had no trouble believing it . If he had anything to say about the love of Christ , it was a cold , silver object , not thep156hot , gold stuff . For once , he did n't get mad when the lady next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to meet minimum requirements among the beatitudes . He even staggered against her , giving her charity a real workout . Now that was real Christianity for you . By Monday his head was clear as a bell . " You 'll notice the slight spring in my limp . " He 'd won . Baxter sought him out and grilled him about what he had done with Selfridge , taking her off so early . Where , what , how many times ? Trousers up or down ? " You just do it to talk about it , do n't you ? " said Brian . " Some truth in that , " said Baxter . " But not the whole picture . " Baxter , grinning , red-faced from his Sunday beaver hunting in Foxglove County , Mass. , or his polo in the snow  --  I know better than that now , thought Brian . Trailing around with this guy like a mascot . Baxter'sguest to life . He was n't going to be any recluse , he 'd tried that at Conception and he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bunch . He could n't lick them at their own game , so must simply think of something else . A million on the stock exchange by the time I 'm a senior , was one idea . Pay for his women , cash on the barrelhead , no psychology , no crapping around . He bought a World Telegram and studied the market ; bought another one ; found the same sense of pattern he found in bridge . Ah ha . Unfortunately , money was a dirty word at the Caseys ' . Kevin used the word sometimes , Beatrice never . Playingp157the market would be like dipping your hands in shit . Brian made some mind bets for a couple of weeks and found he would have made a small profit already . A solitary vice , making circles on those squalid columns  --  IBM could n't miss , that was his ticket . He suddenly saw the whole thing , electric typewriters , giant mechanical brains , and when the war with Russia came , business machines to drop on the enemy . He felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid capital , or whatever they called it . " How much do I need to get started ? " he asked Baxter after a history class . " Hey , where you been ? " said Baxter . " You 're letting Selfridgego to waste , you fool . " " Yeah , I 'm sure . Eating her little metal heart out . Listen , I 'm talking about money . Mazuma . The long green . " He flicked an invisible ash . " Spondulicks , my good man . " " Yeah ? W. C. Fields spoke higher than that . Why you alwaysget that wrong , Sam ? " Baxter quivered . " You fool , you bloated idiot ... " " Lorre speaks faster than that . So , how much do I need to start investing ? " " I guess you could start with ten . " " Ten whats ? " " Ten thousand . That 's for a small start . " " I see . Could you lend me a dollar till Friday ? " Still , the dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake . Old Ebenezer Casey , cackling in hisp158nightgown , showing his prize to some enormous blonde . The big kid going all to pieces , crying and laughing and tugging at his nightgown . " What a man ! " The brain in the glass bowl shook convulsively . Meanwhile , his mother was going the other way , getting a thing on voluntary poverty . By sheer concentration , she managed to look a bit like a European refugee who was down to her last dress . " The war was a punishment , " she said , over dinner . " What else can you expect if you 're rottenwith materialism ? " " Were n't we in the middle of a depression when the war started ? " asked Brian . " Well , that was another punishment . And we did n't learn much , did we ? Look at us now , like pigs at the , er , zoo . All those cars and washing machines and labor-saving things while people are starving . " " Do n't you think we deserve something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making some good money this year , and his wife 's conversion came at an awkward time . Brian could tell that his old man liked money . Not talking about it probably made it worse . " Punishment ? We were n't punished half enough in this country , if you ask me . A little rationing , a little inconvenience . You ca n't truly say that you were punished , dear . " " Oh no , I was n't punished . But some people were . I mean the ones who lost sons . " Awkward silence . Lost sons . Brian continued to think about the stock exchange . Look at it this way , God . Thep159other guys have legs , I 'll have money . That 's fair , no ? I was punished during the war , was n't I ? A little cash would equalize that , and I 'd consider it settled . Would n't bother you again . O.K. , I know how you detest arguments like that . I 'll take it downstairs to the other guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . " Nothing . I just thought of something . " He 's happy , our boy is happy . Is n't it wonderful , our boy is happy ? The beaming , merry-peasant faces of his parents brought on an ungovernable urge to tease . How about givingthem the look of quiet pain instead ? " It 's nothing , Mother . Just . . . nothing . " Hopping sedately to his room , as they rose awkwardly , napkins to groin like Greek statues ; meanwhile , Brian busting a gut laughing . To hell with it . Money . That 's the thing . The next morning , or the one after , he just happened to notice his mother 's purse , on the radiator by the front window : a blue number , with the gold spangles chipped and missing , a couple of them still sparkling in the sunshine . He 'd always wanted to see inside one of those things . It might give a clue to what women were up to . His rummaginghand dragged out a Kleenex with streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirteencents . Very revealing . His hand settled on the bills . His parents still gave him a child 's allowance , it was one of those things that had n't grown , and he thought , " She owes it to me anyway . " Then , " She does n't want it herself . " Then , after a lingering caress , " Well , those were interesting thoughts . " He released the cash , and clicked the purse shut.  |p160He  decided to analyze the thoughts . One curious part was that right and wrong had n't come into it at all . He could recall half-thoughts and coded bleeps like , twentysixis n't worth the risk ; five would n't be noticed , ten would ; cripples would make great thieves . Hey , that last one was worth saving . He could see himself heaving along supermarketaisles , stuffing his pockets to bursting , and clanking out through the check-out counter . Or staring at natty floorwalkers until they looked away for very shame , and then quick , the Hope Diamond . Precious stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or how about terror ? Lurching through the fog like Jack the Ripper . Ping , goes the little shop bell . " We 're closed for the evening , sir . Sir ? . . . ooh ooh , it 's aargh "  --  Casey 's twisted shadow falls across the shopgirl , his hands move with amazing dexterity . No kidding , he could probably pick up a nice piece of change as a sneak thief . Undignified to be caught , of course ; but undignified for them , too . They 'd probably let him go . Or at least get another cripple to search him . His constitutional right . Anything to take advantage of their sentimentality . Even his parents , by God , would bend over backwards , not to suspect him . That 's a nice ruby , dear . Now go to bed . Just a morning 's thoughts like any other . ( Did everyone talk to themselves like this ? If not , what did they do with their heads all day long ? ) Then one day the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual cash registerthat had been left open , and which twinkled with crisp new bills . The owner had gone out back , looking forp161an electric heater for Brian 's room , and his mother was back there with him . A stack of verdant twenties , fresh lettuce . What 's up , doc ? There was no time to think about it , maybe five seconds , to judge from the voices and positionof the feet . His mother usually wound down and succumbedto sales talk by about the third item . He found that his thoughts were all in order , and remarkably serene . Test of nerve , this first time . Just a game . Pursuing his analysis . He would , of course , never do it again . Carefully , he peeled off five twenties , no more : not hurrying was part of it . He moved away a few feet , and began scrutinizing lawn mowers . The register rang behind him , his mother had paid for the heater . He imagined the man frowning briefly , something vaguely askew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some things people do n't want to know . Brian turned with an innocent , bored blink . " All set , Mother ? " The guy had a weak face , he would n't follow it up . When he got home , he called a brokerage house and found out how to buy a share of IBM . Things , according to the older , wiser Casey , tend to have a crooked recoil : you expect it on one shoulder and it hits the other . Part of it was that he felt like a jackass about the theft . Not guilty  --  sex had all the rights to that  --  but sheepish . A sheepish , if you can imagine , jackass . They had a rule about this kind of thing on his block . He and his middle-class friends used to pinch fruit off a stand on 125th Street , but you quit doing it by fifteen at the latest  --  if mentally retarded , you had till sixteen . After that , you leftp162it to people who needed the fruit . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He felt now like cashing his share and mailing the money back anonymously . " Your obedient servant , Fitzroy , son of Raffles . " But being a jackass was n't the worst of it . He could live with that . The worst of it , the rich taste he could n't get rid of , was that he 'd really enjoyed it  --  hearing the feet , the voices : finding in the stupefying dull sounds of a hardware store the pleasures of fear . And then , taking the money slowly , prolonging the fear like a wine-tasting . It was betterto be seen committing the worst crime calmly than to be caught doing nothing nervously . A jerky move over by the lawn mowers and Mr. Felt would have looked into the cash register . No connection , but that 's what he would have done . People fear suspicious behavior more than real activity . Hell , you could have the precious gem mailed to you , if you knew how to behave . He was satisfied at first just to have the philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself instantly bored  --  he was n't a writer . He 'd rather be written about . A writer was just a servant to the people who did things . Maybe if life had n't cast him in a passive role , it would have been different : but a crippled writer was too much . What he really wanted , there was no escaping it , was to do it just once again , to see if his theory was right , and to relive that juicy moment in the hardware store . To be fully alive again for five seconds  --  Christ , he 'd even pay for it . Too bad it was out of the question . It brought back sop163many things he had been forcing out of his mind  --  waiting to release the ball until you could hear the linemen 's breath ; sinking foul shots while the sweat swam into your eyes ; going a little further with fear than the others . And then , as a reward , to find fear opening the senses , so that you felt the cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; saw things from the side of the eye , caught highlights from the river , when they played down there ; knew by the odor which man was guarding you . Stay with fear , and it will show you sights , boy , take you where no man has trod . And now he had found something nice in the fear line that he could do as well as they could , if not better , and it was considered shameful and neurotic . " They ought to make a sport out of larceny . " " They already have  --  they 've made them all out of larceny . " Ah , wisdom . Who needs thee ? He gradually fought the temptation into an obsession . Just once more  --  and maybe try putting the thing back the next day ? No , putting it back would make the whole thing ridiculous . Like returning the money people lost at poker . You 've got to pretend the game is real , to extract the honey from it . Anyway , I 'm not going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into early spring . Baxter gave up on him . Selfridge had found a poet with terrible teeth . Crazy . No friends for now , a de facto recluse . On odd afternoons , he took the bus downtown to play his new game  --  a game like the stock market , like life itself . He visited all the big stores and figured how he would rob them , if he had the criminal mind . He checked the firep164exits and men 's rooms  --  no , that was the wrong style for him . No use being furtive  --  better to exploit his high visibility . Fall down and let them put you on the elevator . Stuffed like a goose with goodies . Have heart attack over there by the desk  --  no , that 's going too far . They 'd immediatelystart feeling under coat for pulse . Find grandfather clock . " Can I help you , sir ? " " No , I 'm just waiting for my mother . " Right now , he was trying to look occupied in Lord &; Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores might be better than men 's . True , you were more noticeable , but they did n't keep trying to sell you things . The house dicks were presumably training their eyes on the broads . A man working these stores would surely get a footnote in criminalhistory . He practiced his unobtrusive stance , waiting audaciouslyby the information desk itself , with the slumped resignation of a male appendage . " Waiting for my girl friend . " Better than mother , less sinister somehow . You poor guy , you 'll have to pay for all this , wo n't you ? Sympathy , a bonus . For a grown son , dragged here by the hair by Mom , they would probably feel contempt . " I 'm waiting for my wife . " Really ? Hooded gaze at that one . Well , it was worth a try . In two and a half hours , only three queries . " Still waiting ? " Four . " My girl friend goes a little crazy in these places , " he said , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The game was O.K. as far as it went , but it was finally just more wisdom . As he stood in Bendel 's on Thursday of Holy Week , watching the salesladies swoop by , he felt likep165a store dummy . They seemed to notice him less , the longer he stayed . But perhaps they were registering him a little more every minute . He would never know , unfortunately . He had long since figured that the thing to steal here was the soft fabrics  --  some of those spring dresses would fold up to nothing , he bet . One would simply hump over the counter , and finger them with that bored expression . " Will Mother never be done ? " Time the staff in their rounds so you would n't have to look up suddenly . Pick out a dress and crumple it casually into one 's bosom . His bulgy winter coat would hold a full wardrobe . And what the hell would I do with a spring dress ? Sell it to the Mafia . Give it to Nancy Selfridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Not important . The thing is to see if a beautiful abstract plan can be brought to throbbing life , right ? Elevator , maybe seventy-five feet away . Two girls chatting  --  the little blonde tends to gaze around while her Italian-looking friend is talking . Better wait till she starts talking herself . My own saleslady , the one who keeps asking if I 'm all right , has disappeared . Women take , what , about three minutes in the can ? Tuggingoff the girdle , grunting back into it  --  God knows what happens to the stockings , it 's no business of mine . In the quiet , dull shop with the whispering girls and the purring rug , he began to feel the same giddy thrill he had experienced in the dust and metal of the hardware store . The ominous smell of pots and pans had been O.K. , but the feline menace of cloth and soft perfume was better , classier . There was more variety to this game than any of thep166famous ones , which were played in fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had landscapedthe place to a fare-thee-well , knew where all the living people were , and which of the inanimate objects had souls . To the mannequin with the two-way radio wristwatch , he said , " Would you tell my girl friend I got tired of waiting . She 's wearing a checkered coat . " He planned every step , all the way to the bus . The dress would be stashed under his belt by then so it would n't shake loose , and his features would convey blank animation . Fine American boy . Damn pity about his handicap . You 're not really going to do it ? He wished he could hold this moment forever , the timed shopgirls , the eddy of customers ( drawing away from him for sure : their collective mood was homeward ) , the boiling clarity of his mind . " Have you ever been alive , madam ? " Lady gift-wrapping an Easter bunny . His side vision was simply fantastic . Both flanks were covered . A cluster of shoppers to the left formed a screen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the flow of eyes that way . Not an interesting enough fuss to hold them for long , shrill but monotonous . Half a minute , call it . The elevator finger began moving sedately up from the basement and the crowd below stood moonstruck , staring at it . Opportunity in sufficient quantity can constitute temptation . But of course , he had already decided . His exaltation depended on his doing something now  --  he had no right to his exaltation if he did n't do something . The devil was a nut on small bills like this . He began to walk , sensuous to bursting , to the nearest counter . Thep167carpet was spongy underfoot , like good turf , and all the joy he had ever known in sports ringed his head like frosted diamonds . The fabric was absolutely luscious , and profoundlysexy . Heaven would be lined with this stuff . He could fondle it forever . This red number would be nice on Selfridge . Or the green one for Mother . One , two  --  O.K. , the green one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming point , he slipped the dress into his coat . He looked around blandly , not focusing , the way celebritiesdo . Now for the stately trudge to the elevator . One jog step , two . Three . Four . " What are you doing , sonny ? " Where the hell did she come from ? A grey-haired lady with rimless glasses had a hand on his wrist strong enough to make his fingers fly open . " You 'd better put it back , " she said . It would be undignified to argue with her . He pulled out the dress and handed it over . " Where do we go ? " he asked . " Home , " she said , " as fast as you can . " " Are n't you going to arrest me ? " She looked him up and down . " No , " she said . Ludicrously , he wanted to hang around and talk to her . How did you get into this business ? Did you spot me all along ? Was it just hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the elevator , making up answers for her . " Leave it to the professionals , sonny . You looked around too much  --  real pros do n't do that . You 're a marked man from Abercrombie'sto Zeek 's Appliances . Have you thought of psychiatrichelp ? " He pushed into the elevator , and she was still beside him . A compliment , in a way . " Very plucky ofp168you to try it in your condition . In view of your handicap , we wo n't say another word about it , " he imagined her saying . She saw him to the door , old enough to be his mother , and he slushed out into a sodden spring rain . More fucking wisdom , it was all he was allowed to have . They would n't even arrest him . He took the number 5 bus home , and nobodyoffered him a seat . And for the first time , until now , he felt like shouting , " Offer me a seat , you bastards . You 've got everything else . "  |p169Brian  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier thanarguing with his father about labor unions and such . Kevin , your old-line Democrat , without much stomach for it , would defend the " union principle , " but then admit theywere all corrupt in practice . Brian : " What 's the good of aprinciple if it never works out in practice ? " Kevin : " You , a Catholic , can ask that ? " His father had acquired the slynessof the hen-pecked , of the man who sneaks a drink inthe closet . Upright Catholic that he was these days , he stillliked his bit of mischief . Brian assumed Beatrice hadsqueezed some of the starch out of her husband butcould n't remember when . It was such a cliche to be aknow-it-all about one 's parents . Brian was sold , right now ,  |p170on  the mystery of the human heart , and he was sure that Mauriac and Peguy could flush some amazing secret out of his parents . Or if they could n't , they could n't . ( Yeah , he felt good this year , could n't explain why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole politicalposition , as it became advisable to have one . He was certainly not going to be any youthful radical  --  how banal can you get ? Everyone knows that youthful radicals wind up as chairman of the board . The conservative position was more glamorous , and he was impressed by Tocqueville on revolution , but his ancestry nixed that . It might be chic for a Jew to be conservative , but it was hopeless for an Irish Catholic . At home , he liked to heckle his mother about Dorothy Day and the radical pacifists ( " What 's so spiritual about dirty fingernails ? " ) , but at school he just took the line that everything was very complicated , and that nothing was as simple as his opponent thought . " Do n't you believe in anything ? " asked his new friend Woody Kline . " Not much . " " Do n't you think that skepticism is kind of a youthful pose ? " So it was hard finding a position . The cliches were everywhere : nice , though , having Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy body , who told him he was very smart for a goy . " I can improve your I.Q. twenty points if you 'll submit to this simple little operation . " Woody and Murray and Seymour , a whole bunch of new friends , all tugging him gently to the left . They could n't get him top171support Henry Wallace , though . " On aesthetic grounds . Four years of that prose and the language is finished . " " Elegant detachment is very Catholic , " said Woody , who was on to his weakness for originality . " Radicalism for its own sake is very Jewish , " said Brian and added , " When you 're a successful dentist , then we 'll talk . " He was continuously puzzled at the way he made friends . He pictured himself as this hard , lonely man  --  sidestepping the Byron cliche as best he could , only to land splat in the Bogart , O.K. , O.K.  --  but somehow , he could always count on a few people liking him , even when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was easy to fall in step with after class . For the same reason , people were always asking him directions . Also , he could be pretty funny , not great but adequate , so he attracted the wags . ( Funny people need each other , he decided , and are ready to overlook gross incompatibilities . ) And then maybe there was something mysterious about him , eh ? a secret wound that fascinated people . O.K. , Byron , move over . There 's room for both of us . His new friends were , as a class , physically inept . They were n't always running on ahead of him . In fact , left to themselves , they probably moved even slower than he did . Woody hardly moved at all , but lay on his bed playing Bartok records and planning the revolution . " We 're going to use you as a figurehead , with your permission . You have a lot of Idiot appeal , and God knows we need an Irish Catholic . " " Do I have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they devour their young . Right ? Then , when the romantic figures like me have been liquidated , some fat-faced little accountant moves in and runs the place like a military hospital . Meanwhile , all the biological checks and balances that keep the system healthy have been destroyed . Everyone knows that about revolutions . " " Catholic shit . Equilibrium , preferably with me on top . Do n't you know that history is movement , for Christsake ? Revolutions are happening all the time  --  good ones , dumb ones , blind ones . Do you think any professional revolutionarycould have achieved the changes this country has been through since 1900 ? Christ , you must have read history in Latin , if you think history has equilibrium . " " I believe in organic change . Manipulated change is arti-ficial . " " Christ , you bought the whole crock , did n't you ? You think maybe labor unions are organic ? Ask my old man who got his head busted in a garment workers ' strike in1935 " You lie . " " Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter who . Listen , Casey  --  it is n't a question of deciding whether you want a revolution  --  you 've got one  --  but which kind you want . " " All right . I 'll take one that 's made in America . We know our own tastes better than Uncle Joe does . " " That 's funny . You get your religion from abroad . Why not your politics ? " And so on . Brian felt that Woody really did n't want to resolve these questions right now , but wanted them to lastp173forever , like summer picnics . " You do n't really want a revolution , do you Kline ? You might have to give up your apartment , for one thing . " " I do n't know . We 'd only have to start another in five minutes to straighten out the first one . " Seymour Rankin said , " I want one . What the fuck else are we talking about ? " " No  --  Woody really does n't . He 's a professional revolutionary . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian found he was beginning to do more talking than reading . He 'd been by himself too long . There was a virile affection in this kind of talking , like old heavyweights embracing . Yah , they cuffed each other and snarled , but it was just a way of saying , " I love you . " When he tried the same thing at home , though , his mother thought they were real blows , and a couple of times she left the table in tears . " Dorothy Day is not a neurotic . " " All right , all right . If you say so . She is n't . But tell me  --  what exactly is the point of erecting a pigsty like that in the middle of a slum ? I mean , that place of hers on Mott Street is crumbier than any tenement I ever saw . " " How many tenements have you seen ? " asked sneaky Kevin . " That is a dirty question . I can only say , it must be crumbier , because you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other down there . And you know what ? She wo n't ask those bums to clean it , because it would be an affront to their dignity . " " Well , it would , " said Beatrice . " Those people have been dehumanized , do n't you see ? By the system . Anyway , a clean floor is n't that important . "  | " Boy , you think it is . You clean ours every day . And do n't you think maybe that 's why we have dignity and they do n't ? For godsake , Mother  --  do you think the poor are different from us ? How condescending can you get ? Do n't you think they 'd like to have clean houses too ? But then you get these romantic slobs from the middle class coming down and saying , No no , dirt is good . Keep your nice dirt ! ' You know , if there 's one thing that keeps the lousy system going , it 's people like Dorothy Day . " How 'd he arrive at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm smarter than they are . " No , I mean it . The Rich Catholics just love her . The poor are better than you , ' she tells them . Right you are , ' say the Rich Catholics . We are but miserablesinners , the lowliest of men . We wish we had your strength , Miss Day . Now , there 's a dollar and get lost . ' So , they get to keep the real big money and feel humble into the bargain , and Miss Day gets to be called a saint , which is probably all she wants anyway , and  --  " " You do n't have to make a speech about it , " said Kevin . It was true , there was no affection , no old heavyweights about it . He felt more like a shyster lawyer talking them out of their homestead . " You twist everything , " said Beatrice . " Just for the sake of argument . I know you do n't mean it . " He did n't know if he did or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her this was cold and empty , like everything else they did at Columbia . " Have you given any more thought to law school ? " Kevin asked politely.  | " Yeah , I have n't made up my mind yet . Listen  --  Mother , I know Dorothy Day is a great woman and I would n't have the guts to live that way myself . And if we 're going to have this system , and maybe we should , then somebody has to look after the people who get broken by it . All I am saying is that if you want real change ... " It did n't help a bit . He had attacked Dorothy Day , had n't he ? The average mind , he understood , worked in dense murk . Lunging at shadows of comfort or distress . Her eyes filled with tears  --  now , even after his retraction . Well , maybe the average mind was right . He had attacked Miss Day , that was the reality of the thing . His mood changed : ideas should n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those guys sitting on their butts , playing Revolution : guys who had never worked a day in their lives , or witnessed a death . His mother was right to cry . His friends and he were the biggest cliche of all , smart-ass college kids . Dorothy Day was real , she had done something , but they could shoot her down for a gag . They could also confuse the Beatrice Caseys and weaken the faith of the murk dwellers , just for the sake of an argument  --  a cozy , just-us-boys argument . It was time now to give up this childishness and find a faith of his own . If he could . His father coughed sympathetically , as if he understood the problem perfectly . " I do n't know , Woody . I 'd sign up for the revolution right now , if there really was one , and if I could really be/lieve in it . But you ca n't believe in something just for the sake of believing in something , can you ? " " Ca n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , I 'm serious . It 's not so easy for Catholics anyway . We 've really worked all the combinations on faith , you know ? Faith from memory , faith from tricksy argument , faith for the sake of the children . We 're exhausted by the time we get to politics . " " I know , " said Woody . " As a Jew I 've been vouchsafed certain insights . And you and I know , as the heathens do not , that true believers can actually get by without that much faith . " " How can this be , Mr. Bones ? You talk in riddles . " " Listen  --  take some old priest working the barrios in Brazil , or some Marxist brewing up a storm in Beirut , and ask him how much he believes . He 'll blink at you for a minute , wondering why the hell you 're wasting his time , and then he 'll mumble some line a twelve-year-old would n't swallow . Fact is , they 've completely forgotten . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the existential situation . " " I 'm sure you 've been sent to me for a purpose , Kline . But what could it be ? I mean , if these people have forgotten what they 're doing , are n't they a menace ? " " Yeah , that 's one catch . That 's why we-who-know have to purge them now and then . But seriously , though , what you chose is a way of life , and you know whether that 's right or not . "  | " Ah , you secular mystics . Just know , huh ? In the blood would that be ? Or in the brave cojones ? " " You 've got to get over the Reformation some time , Casey . I 'm not talking about private judgment , if that 's what you 're worried about . I 'm talking about the various collective judgments that are reasonable at any one time . Ally yourself with the best of these and see what happens . If you 're lucky , history will pat you on the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic stretched before them . But Brian wanted to get somewhere this time . " You know , Woody , I keep taking your arguments home to Mother , and then I make up ones for her to send back to you . We 're not getting anywhere . Let 's put it this way . I guess as a Catholic I find any worldly cause kind of idolatrous  --  Imean , in five minutes it has its own God and its priests and its junky dogmas , and you just have to start stoning it again . Tell me what 's wrong with that . " " No  --  it 's a perfect attitude for a revolutionary . Catholics make terrific revolutionaries , you know . " " But I keep telling you , I do n't trust revolutions . They turn to shit after that first good night in the beer cellar . I can only buy ad hoc setups , where something good seems to be going on . Like , for instance  --  " Saints forgive me  --  " Dorothy Day and The Catholic Worker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for priests and pacificism for dogma ? " " Shit , Kline  --  you 've got to rest those ruthless powers of analysis sometimes . Do you want to sit in the bathtub andp178play the trombone all day , or do you want to do some-thing ? " " You 've got it at last , Casey . Welcome to the Party . " The next part was disappointing . It seemed that Woody was n't exactly a Communist  --  the Berlin  --  Moscow pact had embittered him at the age of nine , and he 'd been shopping around restlessly ever since . It was kind of pointless to be a Trotskyist , what with the old man dead , and nothing seemed to be jelling right in the postwar world . Tito might be worth watching , allow that the murder of Mihailovich may have been dialectically necessary , but there was still something of the gangster opportunist about him  --  move his country a few miles further west and he 'd be endorsing Wheaties . China might be interesting in a year or two . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something , I want to do it  --  not just sit here twirling the globe like Lowell Thomas . " " The thing is probably to build revolutionary cells and hand them over to the best power bloc , when the time comes . " That is just a bunch of words , and you know it . You 're still playing , are n't you , Woody ? " " Maybe . Maybe I stop at this point . I 'm just a recruiter with a cute smile . " Brian proceeded to ask him the names of groups that were doing things ; he did n't know any . Where do we beginthen ? He could n't say . The thing now was to lie down again and savor the latest step in one 's own development.  | " The trouble is , " said Brian , over his second quart of beer , " I do n't give that much of a shit about developments in Lower Slobovia . You can wait forever for help to arrive from some Communist International  --  like the Irish waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the Chinese will finally float a gunboat up the Hudson and lay siege to New Jersey . So what ? " He belched a golden mouthful of Ballantine . " Now who 's playing ? I 'm talking about the future of Latin America  --  how to weaken the almighty Fruit Lobby , little things like that . " " And I 'm talking about fixing up New York City . Tearingdown some slums . Giving the colored man a break . " He said the words awkwardly , forcing new passions into existence : he had n't thought about the colored man in years . " Ah , a meliorist . A little Band-Aid for Madame 's can-cer ? " Brian suddenly felt suffocated ; he wanted to smash the china teacups and take a flaming torch to the guests . Woody 's fat , indoor face was like a madam 's , inviting him to stay in the whorehouse , the whoring word-house , foreverand ever . " You talk too fucking much , you know that Kline ? Twenty years from now , you 'll still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ecuador . " " It 's a way of life , " said Woody . " I thought you liked to talk . " " Yeah . But it 's not a disease with me . What the fuck are you doing for Madame 's cancer , by the way ? " Woody stood , as if to prove he could . " It 's no use , Casey . You 're an incurable athlete . You think talking will weaken you . Itp180will , too . " Woody yawned . It sure as hell had weakened him . Still , he would become a teacher someday and sign things . He would send his students into battle . If they felt up to it . Brian had learned a lot from this bastard , but it was n't enough . Still , it was nice being called an athlete again . " You 're a dangerous man , Casey , " said Kline , after a long silence , and opening one eye . " Ah yes , oh swami ? How 's that ? " " You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temples with his fingers . " I see a man stalking Dublin in his trenchcoat . I see a post office ... " " Get stuffed . What do you really see ? " " I see a man of little faith and much energy , the most dangerous of your curious human species . A cynical man of action . You could wind up on either side of this thing , you know . " Brian thought , I 'd better not believe this or it 'll come true for sure . " What you see , Kline , is a storm trooper . You 're always seeing storm troopers . Not that I blame you . After the recent unpleasantness . " " Thanks . " That was n't funny . Brian hurried past it . " Also , you 're so dingdong passive that anyone who paces the floor looks like a track star . I just said , Let 's do something , and you head for the bomb shelter . " " Maybe , maybe . Anyway , I do n't want you in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card and all your bombs . " They had another quart of Ballantine and talked about movies.  |p181Analyzing  the campus like a bridge hand : the political activists were deuces and treys this year ; the aces and kings were the political dropouts . The guys who knew the mythical Kerouacand typed their haikus on toilet paper . The political groups had to be kept going , like Protestant churches , by somebody . But the best people were n't doing it any more . The Wallace fiasco had knocked the stuffing out of them . Harry S. Nonentity would now proceed to nail down the Iron Curtain for good , and spangle the globe with good U.S. Steel . " What do you say we just give up ? " Brian said to Woody one day.  | " And enjoy the imperial decadence , you mean ? Not me . I have a commitment to my father 's busted head . " " I myself have half a mind to cultivate my own garden for a spell , " said Brian . " Under a spreading nuclear um-brella . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those words and everything . " Actually , part of Brian 's brain was attracted by the imperialvision : Roman legions marching out through the gate of Janus . American soldiers with the Sun on their helmets , manning their checkpoints  --  just as a picture , he liked it better than the scruffy losers , the pale-faced clergy of the Left . You 'd be inhuman not to . " I guess there 's some of the fascist pig in all of us , " he said . " Yeah ? You find that ? " " A little bit , sure . Be honest about it , Kline . Do n't you get just a small aesthetic boot out of a well-drilled army doing its stuff ? " " It makes me sick . " " O.K. , O.K. It was just a passing fancy . So what do you propose we do now ? Please do n't say call a meeting . I could n't stand another meeting . " " Fucking snobbery . " " Fucking condescension to you . You 're just as bored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jerkoffs do all the talking at meetings , the little farts with the fivepartquestions . Mark my words : the Left will bore itself to death at meetings before the enemy even finds us. "  | " You 're right about fascist pig . What do you want ? A well-drilled army ? Or one smart guy named Casey to take the place of meetings ? " " He does n't have to be named Casey . Look , Kline . Are we that committed to inefficiency ? Let 's have a little Stalinizationaround here . You know what happens at meetings . After everyone has voiced his scruples and registered his outrage , we finally agree to draft a telegram . We , the undersigned , wish to deplore ... " Denounce , ' shouts Fred the Fart . All right , denounce . Denounce in the strongest ... " Most unequivocal , ' screams Jerry Jerkoff . That 's two words , at night letter rates  --  ' " " O.K. , skip the crap and get to the story point . " " All right . Denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Turn Left Society of Columbia University . ' The cable arrives at the White House . The blood drains from the Chief Executive 's face . By God , fellows , this alters everything . I 've just heard from the Turn Left Society . ' " " Very cruel and very easy , " said Woody . " The boys in the German High Command would have roared over that one . The pathetic little people with their puny telegrams . " " Hey , you 're really sore , are n't you , Woody ? " " Damn right I am . O.K. , a telegram is n't much . I happen to think it helps . Maybe we can think of something better next time . But Jesus , what 's the good of anything , if we give up the principle of discussion ? What 's the good of the Left if you sneer at the farts and jerkoffs ? " What good indeed ? " I do n't know , Woody . I really don't.  |p184I  believe all the same things you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think New York City is a crock of crap , and it 's the best we have . So ? I ca n't see a string of Henry Wallaces setting things right . " " That lousy campaign , " said Woody . " How many generalizationscan you draw from one lousy campaign ? " " Plenty , " said Brian . He looked around . Cold winter light curtained the window . A depressing time to talk about anything . The aimless conversation had finally bumped against something bad . There was distress in Kline 's face  --  you 're not my brother after all . That , Brian swore , was all that happened that day . The well-drilled army had done it : yeah , face it Casey , you admired that one too , the one Woody 's thinking about . Brian had alwaysfeared that when they got to the end of their argument , he would be on the wrong side . Woody looked at him and shrugged . Brian nodded . " O.K. , then . " " You want the rest of this beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on . Kerouac 's disciples did n't appeal to him at all . Through the agency of a classmate he got himself invited to a coupleof their parties , and it was almost as bad as going to meetings . There were always the one or two original guys , and hordes of imitations . The " hmm , good tea , man " crowd . Zen had its own Fred Farts and Jerry Jerkoffs . Intolerant bastard , Casey . O.K. then , I envy them . I am the real brain in the glass bowl . I can not take the road and screw Mexican peasants on the hoods of hot rods . I envy those who can.  |p185He  did n't even chance smoking the tea , until he 'd tried it in safer circumstances ; and beer did not set you up right for this kind of party . Still , he made some friends . Brad Jackson , who took off his pants when he wanted people to go home . Gary de Falco , who shouted , " You all eat shit " whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second party Brian got a chance to ask them both over to his place for a beer . If he could get the originals without the imitations he might find something he could use . They arrived the next afternoon with jugs of Muscat . His mother took one look and actually left the house . " You wonder why I 've asked you all here , " said Brian . Brad waved his hand . " Never gave it a thought . " " I wanted to ask you how you stand the company atthose parties ? " " What company ? I do n't see any company at those parties . " " I see . Next question . Who did you vote for in the last election ? " " I think I can answer that for you , " said de Falco . " I voted for Won Hung Lo , great white hope to topple Ming Dynasty . " " Fine American , " said Jackson . " Great war record . " They gave Brian some marijuana , which made him giggle . They called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese New Year . " No spesha plan . Liberate coolies . Try get closer to numberi wife . " Brian snuffled with laughter at his own multicoloredopacity : his face , which he could see very well from inside , was red and rheumy as a dragon . Aarf , Ker/chow . Fire ran up and down him like a maddened elevator . They played some Andre Kostelanetz records , the hottest item the Caseys owned , and Brian shook with glee , especiallyover the violins . The others paid no mind to him . After a while , de Falco said , " Kostelanetz eats shit . They all do , you know . " And Jackson said , " They do n't write music like Beethoven any more . " " Listen , " said Brian from his underwater home , " this is n't Beethoven , it 's Jerome Kern . " " I know , " said Jackson . Brian shrieked . " Got ta go now , " said de Falco . " You 've been a wonderfulaudience . " " Do n't go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Been here for two hours . Muscat 's gone . Say hello to your mother . " They were undulating toward the door already . " Wait ! You ! The one with the striped ass ! " shouted Brian . But they were gone . He shaded his eyes with his hand and dry-heaved with laughter . He was still agitating when his mother came in , sniffing , with a shopping bag . " What 's the smell , Brian ? What are you laughing about ? " she asked . " Nothing . You  --  just  --  look  --  so  --  funny ! " He fell sideways , and his gut landed on a spike of laughter and ground itself out . She helped him up , and he sat tremblingslightly . She looked frightened but did n't say anything . After a while he calmed down , and nothing more was said about it . Disgusting , sloppy , wasteful . Made a fool of self . Got top187keep a clear head . ' Sall I 've got . Still idling irregularly . Missing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , or a sunburst of memory . Muscat and marijuana , making their last rounds . Got to do something useful , must n't fuck up like those guys . Have been given great gifts , my son , therefore great responsibilities . Must n't squander them in the bath water . His head right now was a damp cellar with people bumping into each other and shouting " ouch " and " ah ha ! " and he was happy to wake up to a clear blue day and find his mind bright as silver . He decided he might as well give the Turn Left Society another whirl , just for something to do . The losers with the gravy stains might look better after his afternoon with the winners , the windblown lords of creation . Woody Kline raised an eyebrow when he saw Brian come in , and so help me turned his back . Geez , you know , the guy hates me . He 's had time to think . Do I mind ? No . Fuck him . Try to win him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sieg Heil and all that . " " You shit . " Never win him back that way . Ah , well . Having enemy not all bad . At least somebody 's thinking about you . Promiseyou 'll never change , Woody . Promise you 'll never grow indifferent . They took their places on rickety auditorium chairs , and the meeting droned to life . It seemed there was a crisis of leadership . Chairman Zeke Snyder had defected to the Right with a snarl . " Must have been something he read , " said Deputy Chairman Rankin . So they needed a new boy ,  |p188and  would somebody like to propose someone . Woody 's name came up , but he said he was n't the boss type . Fuckingprig . He in turn proposed promoting Rankin , who smiled demurely as if sources close to Rankin felt that he would not refuse a draft . Brian was amusing himself makingup a speech for Rankin  --  " Unfortunately my opponentshave seen fit to take the low road . They have resorted to Goebbels 's tactic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard his own name mentioned . Someonemust be kidding . He looked back at Woody , who was glaring at him ferociouslyfrom the rear left corner . O.K. , Woody , you asked for it . " Would Member Casey accept the nomination ? " " Sure . Why not ? " " What kind of answer is that ? " bawled Woody . " You think this is a joke or something ? " " I 'm sorry I offended Member Kline . I was shocked by the question . Let me try again . Yes , I would be honored by the nomination . " Woody was on his feet . " Maybe Member Casey would like to take another minute before deciding . It 's my understanding that he does n't approve of meetings or popularassemblies of any kind . " Your bid , Casey . Wait till they 're all looking . Slowly does it . Like stealing diamonds . Now . " Member Kline must be referring to some facetious words I had with him in private . I did n't know you were taking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here if I did n't approve of meetings . "  |p189A  little too smooth ? Maybe . We 'll see . " You make it sound pretty sinister with that in private ' stuff , " said Woody . " I 'm sorry I broke the seal of the confessional , Casey . Most conversations are held in private . I just thought you might like to be reminded of your own convictions . " " Thanks . Was there anything else ? " Woody took a lunging step forward and flung a hand through his black hair . Brian thought he was about to shout " Strike ! " No idea Woody was capable of such passion . Do n't underrate the little people , Herr Commandant . Woody was locked in some terrible moral struggle . To go on now , he must expose more of that private conversation , and it obviously went against his conscience . Big sissy . Brian smiled . Go ahead , I 'll truss you up in that conversationand carry you out in it . " I have reason to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What reason , what reason ? " I do n't believe he is in sympathy with the purposes of the club . I believe he is an ambitious guy who would like to run anything he could get his hands on , just for the sake of running something ... " " I do n't know if psychiatric evidence is admissible , " said Brian . " What about someone who is afraid to run anything ? " The medical twist reminded Brian , as he seldom was these days , of his legs . They would be an ambiguous factor for an onlooker to weigh . Was this same embittered cripple compensating with crazy power drives ? Or was hep190a wise man matured by pain ? You be the judge . One thing that was clear was that his enemy was standing and he was seated . He looked up at Woody with a mild , peaceful expression . " I may be ambitious , Woody , but remember , I did n't ask for this nomination . " Woody sat down . He must have sensed the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey admiresthe German Army , " he said desperately . Anger now , or lose it all . Very slow burn . Long glare . Then  --  " Are you kidding , Woody ? That 's the meanest , craziest thing I ever heard . I do n't know why you do n't want me to have this job , I thought you were my friend ; but I did n't think you 'd go this far to stop anybody . " " What exactly did Casey say to you ? " asked Rankin grimly . There were only about twelve guys present , but there was a nice little smell of danger . Get him now , boy . " I do n't remember exactly , " said Woody , " but I remember what he meant . " " I remember , " said Brian . " I said I had an aesthetic admiration for precision drill . I did n't say anything about Germans . Obviously , if I admired the Nazi Army , I would not be attending the Turn Left Society . Unless Member Kline believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I could take it over and silence a vital voice on the Left . " Woody must see by now that his opposition had guaranteedBrian 's victory by acclamation . " Christ , you 're even worse than I thought , " he said , directly to Brian , and stalked to the door . Hell , I 've made a fool of him , thought Brian . Why did I do that ? It was n't necessary ; and besides ,  |p191he  was half-right . More than half . " Look , Woody  --  if I get elected , I hope you 'll stay . " Woody hovered over his galoshes , paying no attention . Brian wanted to add , " Look , I can honor a contract . I 'll run it the way you want me to , " but of course , that would be admitting his guilt . " We need you , Woody . " Woody stomped down on his galosh . You ca n't argue with a cripple , can you ? Take the job , cripple . Brian could do no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , but truckling was out . Too bad . It was messy and regrettable . One should n't have to shed blood . He did n't get his acclamation . A couple of members trusted Woody and viewed Brian now with sour-eyed suspicion . Interesting . They would doubtless resign , after a talk with Kline , leaving Brian in charge of nine members , plus two absentees . What the shit did it matter ? Tomorrow he would start recruiting , and make this club something worth fighting over . His veins ran carbonated cream as the votes were counted . Hot damn ! " Five votes for Casey , one vote for Rankin . " That was n't something so very terrible he 'd done to Kline . Woody had botched the German Army story hopelessly . The guy was unbalanced on the Nazi question . " Eight for Casey , nine for Casey . " Hell , he turned on me first . " Would you like to say a few words ? " Here was a game he could play with anybody . Woody had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knee braces . His legs were part of his political equipmentnow , part of the game . Which made it all quite different . " I 'd love to , " he said.  |p192Broaden  the base . Get outside speakers . Offer free silver . He buzzed with plans . Stage a protest . A student strike against nuclear testing , on the steps of the Low Library . Prod the university 's fat ass . He sat in his room , trying to calm himself with agendas . He knew that what he needed now was sex , in massive doses . Not cold mechanical masturbation : he could pump till dawn , without rooting out the excitement . He had to pass it on to someone else . Go out and have a drink , anyway . Talk brilliantly at the West End Bar . To a small audience of semiparalyzed soaks . He went quietly down the hall . His parents still snored out of tune . You 'd think that they 'd have worked that out after twenty-five years . Shut the door quietly . Didp193he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stank of compromise . So many second-rate evenings died there in squalor , he wanted another victory tonight . He took the subway downtown at ii6th Street instead . The car was mysteriously full for the time of night . Yellow faces bounced and shook in the dirty light . Let me make you a speech . That 's why I 've brought you all down here to my subway . Goddamn , he wanted to see that look again . The look of blind attention in the guys ' faces . He would get that look from a woman someday or die in the attempt . Only eleven people had heard him tonight . God knows what his first large crowd would do to him . Could n't do much more , he supposed . You can only take in so many faces anyway . In fact , he remembered just two , Pete Simmonsand Jerry Wineberg . Both guys rather surly in real life . A speaker receives devotion that nobody else is allowed to see . Like a doctor examining women patients . Cool off now with more plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia is like setting fire to your own playground . Move it downtown . Pick a pressure point , where a dozen guys can snarl up the whole city . Rerouteall these yellow faces that travel forever on the subway . Get arrested ? Of course . But make great speech to the police . And another great speech in court . Also speech to warden , chaplain , and man who brings breakfast . The yellow faces nodded , glassy-eyed . He got out at Fiftieth Street . He 'd heard about a bar . Did n't know if he had enough money . Buy a drink and see.  |p194A  flossy , dead-looking place , as advertised . Man in white , polishing glasses , like surgical equipment . Two suicide blondes at the far end of the bar . Hard to explain , but whole scene extremely sexy . Better think of another plan . March on City Hall , maybe . Lead it in wheelchair . One of the girls came up . " Buy me a drink , dear ? " He nodded . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creases , you saw that it was a fine , sexy face . An honorable face . Worthy of his debut . She sipped her drink and put a hand on his knee . Came up with a handful of brace . Had the politeness to leave it there . " Where you from ? " he asked . " Iowa . " " Why did you leave ? " " Everybody leaves Iowa . " " Miss it ? " Shrug . He wanted to know more about her , but could find no reasonable questions . Married ? Hardly the thing . Like her work ? Live near here ? Live near here . " Do you live near here ? " " I have a room at the Coronia . Sometimes I stay at my sister 's in Jamaica . It 's nice up there . " Fine girl . He put a hand on her knee and was surprised at the harshness of the nylon . Was this what German girls sold their bodies for ? Incredible . Nylons and cigarettes . It was a ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . He shook his head . " Do you come here every night ? "  | " Most nights . " She looked uncomfortable . Interrogations probably had bad associations . " You must like it , " he said . " Would you like some more tea ? " She shuffled under his hand , as if to escape . But he pattedher knee and smiled encouragement . " It 's O.K. , I do n't mind what you drink . Tea is good for you . " She smiled back , uneasily . Poor woman . Do n't worry , I 'll do the talking . You just sit there . He asked her if she 'd ever made a speech . No ? He had . It was fantastic . You know , a bit like your work . The excited johns . At the end , who has had whom ? I do n't know . The speaker is the one who gets paid . She looked as blank as she probably would have if a crazy customer was whipping her , but she picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest . She did n't really do this for a living , you know . But she let it pass . The whole thing must be so goofy and boring . She slid her hand further up his brace until it rested on his groin . Damnit , he was trapped in there . She extricated him . It was a kindness . She smiled slightly past him . Her breath came heavy on his face , and a smell that must be lipstick . It was all much warmer and heavier than he had expected . " Can we go to your place ? " he said . " I ca n't leave here till the bar closes . " " Then ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you mean you do n't know ? "  | " I 'm not supposed to . " What the hell kind of racket was this ? She was into him for two tea and sodas . Was he just paying for her conversation ? and her desolate company ? God , talking to her was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air shaft . " Can I have another drink ? " " Are you kidding ? " She pressed his groin again . Brian noticed the barman frowning . Maybe she was exceeding her duties already . " Got to go to bathroom , " said Brian . " We 'll discuss it when I get back . " But when he turned round a moment at the men 's room door , the bartender was talking to her , and when he returned to his seat , she was back at the far end with her partner . He sat down storming . God knows , he did not feel very good about what he was doing . But such as it was , he should be allowed to do it . . . he glared at her , but she would n't catch his eye ; glared at her friend  --  how about you , honey ? Have some nice tea with Brian ? The bartender was watching him now , like a fat cobra . " What 's the matter with you , Jack ? " said Brian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you running , Jack ? Would greasy little clip joint describe it ? " The man was polishing glasses again . " Christ , why do n't you pee in them ? That 's even cheaper than your finest oolong . " The man glanced at the window . " You 'd better get out of here , kid . " " That 's a great line . Did you make it up yourself ? " Brianp197shouted . Different speeches for different audiences . He would get a rise out of this animal somehow . The man kept looking at the window . Probably some police friend passed the spot every now and then . Brian would n't have a chance . They could make up any story they liked . Unspeakable shakedowns would follow ; mother sobbing quietly in police station , father smirking . We should never have adopted the little buzzard , my dear . O.K. , some honor was salvaged . " It 's a privilege to be thrown out of your little shithouse . I 'm only sorry for the people who have to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have my sympathy , " he said to the girl . " Are you sure you do n't want to come with me ? " Her eyes were blank , even of fear and embarrassment . She would n't look at him . The bartender watched him all the way to the door . What a lousy system . Girls living like that . " Did your mother ever think it would end like this ? " he called to the bartender . When he hit the sidewalk , he found the excitement was still with him , worse than ever . He still wanted that woman , dull heaviness , smell of lipstick , and all . He stood indeterminately outside . Forty-five minutes to closing time , a long time to be standing innocently on a sidewalk . Two cops did pass him , with the same bilious stare as the barman . There was only one expression in this town , dull hate . New York was like a huge retarded familywith a history of syphilis . God , he hated this town tonight , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " What do you boys get out of life ? " hep198wanted to ask the cops , but decided better not . They would pick him up on the way back anyway , and have him before a crooked little magistrate in no time , a greedy venomous hunchback who happened to be the mayor 's brother . He could just make out the burned-out sign of the Coronia Hotel , a block away . He 'd passed it before , a dimly lit walk-up with the lobby on the third floor , and often wondered what kind of people went there . Now was the time to find out . O.K. , Mauriac , O.K. , Greene , he thought as he pushed open the grimy glass door a minute later and started up the stairs . Sin was supposed to be like this . The last time he 'd been up stairs like this , he was looking for a miracle . This time , he was looking for somethinga little more reasonable . You could hardly call it a lobby : just a space with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , anothercheery New York face . " You want a room ? It 's onefifty , cash in advance . " " No , I 'm just waiting for someone . " " Who 're you waiting for ? " " I do n't know her name . " " Well , you ca n't wait here , buddy . " " Is that right ? " He leaned against a peeling wall , facing her . There were no chairs , nothing , it was just a space . Was she going to call the cops , or throw him out herself ? After giving him that **28;14951;TOOLONG glare , she went back to her paper work , whatever the hell that might be . Hey , you notice something , Casey ? Nobody ever doesp199anything around here . All is empty menace . He wanted to go over to the grille and shout , " You 're all under arrest . " Twenty minutes to go . Awkward standing here , back , shoulders stiff , hands sore with sweat on the crutch crosspieces . Acts of defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skirt came up the stairs and gave him a long , slow look , presumably an invitation . If so , no thanks . He wanted Miss Iowa tonight . He would n't take an ounce less . Besides , she had touched him , it was like an engagement . The girl picked up her key , mumbled into the grille , shrugged . They both looked at him , and he smiled charminglyback . Nobody knows what to do with me . A white American cripple can go anywhere . Another girl came up , heavy-assed , heavy of soul , with barely enough energy to look him over bleakly , before picking up her key and disappearing . This must be the after-theater rush . Ten more minutes . " Your friend wo n't be coming now . " " 1 ' 11 wait , " he said . What you do n't know , madam , is that I am the deputy mayor 's son . The one who went all queer . Surely you remember ? Everyone in this town was so sunk in corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much power the others wielded . Maybe this was n't such a bad system after all . He 'd have been arrested ten times over in a civilized city . His mind kept turning back to Columbia politics , to help the time drag past . The bars had been closed for half an hour now , and Miss Fu Manchu looked as if she was getting ready to close up shop . Thrilling wrestling match be/tween the Irish champ and the fat lady . He could n't give up now . He 'd even take the skinny one , if necessary . Or grab the subway out to Jamaica and scour the streets . The fat lady seemed to be lingering now for his sake . Embarrassment ? Kindness ? What secrets lurk in the hearts of men , eh , Graham ? He was frozen to the wall , kept taut by the act of balancing , wondering what the hell he was doing here : hoping for two minutes of mortal sin with a plain girl on a dirty bed , that 's what . Even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . But I ca n't give up , you see . That 's the thing . She arrived at last , and when she saw him , she gave a real , full-bodied start . Beautiful . The man with the questionshad followed her here . The vice squad was sending out its special platoon of gimps to trap her . " Hi , " he said . She just stared . " I waited for you . " She got her key and again the two ladies looked at him . Like two spinsters staring at a cat burglar . " Which is your room ? " he said . Miss Iowa looked at the teller . This was it . Throw-out time or victory . The fat lady shrugged helplessly , the big pussycat . The girl started toward the adjoining corridor where all the girls had gone , not beckoning him but walking slowly , as if to allow for his pace . He 'd won , because they did n't know what else to do with him . " I only have eight dollars , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p201She  nodded . Any sum would have done , or none . It was strange . He had expected , he now knew , to be treated like a child , the ladies explaining why it was all impossible and finally bundling him into a cab . But somehow he had overpoweredthem . Oh , he was hot tonight . He could have overpowered anybody tonight . The room was even fouler than he expected . Great morose stains on the sheets , and when he opened the little drawer by the bed , a teeming muddy contraceptivelingered from the last visitor . Go boy , wallow . It was his trysting place , his rendezvous with love . The shrine was scented with dust and day-old sweat . He reached for the girl 's hips to haul up her skirt , but she walked away and whipped the skirt off herself , a simple wrap-around job held by a safety pin , to reveal a panoply of garters and stocking tops and sweet , mottled thighs . He sat on the bed , the better to bury his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took off her pants with the same sexless economy and sat down beside him , unzipping his fly in a businesslike way , as if preparing him for a medical examination . In a moment she was playing with him , and he had to admit it was very nice , until he realized she was bringing him to a quick boil just to get it over with . He pushed her away . " Hey , not so fast . I want to enjoy this . " " Ooh honey , I ca n't wait . I want it so badly . " He 'd never heard such a silly voice . He wanted to slap it out of her . " Well you 'll just have to wait , " he said , and flung his face at her legs . She squirmed a moment and pushed at hisp202hair with her hands . " Oh honey , I want it so badly . Put it in now . " Shut up , " he said , and kissed her thighs and her hair until she was still , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pussy itself , very wet and slippery , a delight he 'd wondered about so often , very strange , the smell a complete surprise , though he 'd heard jokes , the whole thing not so much wonderful as infinitely surprising . She was trying to play with him again , and again he pushed her away . The vice squad must have its money 's worth . A quiet , tactful struggle for supremacy  --  her eyes were apprehensive when he squinted round at them ( God knows , there was no describing the position they had gotten into now ) , and her voice was stock-company seductive , but her methods were still crisp and professional . One way and another , he did all the things he wanted to , glaring down every eruption of impatience ( hate me but remember me ) , and when he was ready , he refused to let her get on top , though she thought it might be easier for him that way . Childish perhaps , but he had a premonitionhe could call the tunes better from up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear tonight ) . She began to buck and writhe immediately , with passion as trumped up as her stupid voice , urging him to come and flood her with delight . But he held firm , and the writhings mixed with his own stillness produced perfection , the lay of a lifetime . A million-dollar mistress could do no more  --  and this was just a two-bit whore trying to polish him off fast . Sensing the hopelessness of it , she gave up and lay still ,  |p203and  he commenced his own deep motions . " Are you nearly finished ? " she asked , all the tenderness gone . If she 'd been doing him a favor , it was long used up . Good . He shook his head on her cheek . Christ , I 'm a bastard . Has anyone ever gotten more for eight bucks ? He wished now that the clarity of mind would go away . One did this to stop thinking , damnit , to encounter God or the devil in speechless wonder . Well , not tonight . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel mechanical , and he thought , shit , Casey , you 're a superficial character . And he thought , the poor girl has had enough , I must n't outwear my welcome . For a moment , he thought he 'd left it too late , but then it came thundering out as sweet as could be . And when Cinderella looked around , the room was hideous and yellow with filth and the girl was old and pathetic and her thighs were fat , listless splotches . " Have you had enough ? " she said in an old lady 's voice . " I do n't know , " he said . " I really do n't . " Then he added , " Thank you . " " Do n't forget to wash yourself , and leave the money on the table . " He had n't even taken off his pants . She had n't seen him in his naked beauty . Tough nuts to her . She watched him leave , relieved , angry , who knows ? Out in the lobby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the wall . A speech for madam ? No speech . Awfully tired . Please excuse . She watched him to the stairs . He said " Good night , " but if she answered he did n't catch it . Remorse ? Oh sure . Pale catechism remorse , almost gonep204by now . He controlled that argument himself . Forgive me , I have loved much . Also , dirt remorse , cheapness remorse . That terrible room had seemed like a lovers ' bower to him for a time . And he had exploited the girl worse than any bartender . Much to think about on the way home . Exultation ? Oh yes . Fantastic.  |p205The  Turn Left Society got so big itI finally burst in three . Woody Kline , fighting with kamikaze persistence , set up a Turn Left Societyto the Left of Left . Ex-Chairman Snyder tried to start a Revised Turn Left Society on the Right , a special End of Ideology wing , but that in turn split like a firework , and Brian 's branch remained the main one . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Waldorf and Cardinal Spellman during the gravediggers ' strike , which Woody Kline called a politics of gesture . And they got in some Marxist lecturers who Woody said were out of date  --  doddering windbags and tabby cats . " Is it just my breath ? " Brian cabled him from two blocks away . " That has a lot to do with it , " Woody cabled back.  |p206One  saw quickly the limitations of a society like the Turn Left . It appealed , like religion , to only one kind of temperament  --  somewhere between the jock and the theatrical . The rest of the campus chewed its own corner of meadow . To appeal to them , you had to put on a show of a kind which involved changing your nature . Brian gave it a try , with his special orgy committee , which held a mass meeting to discuss the possibilities of spring orgies on Morningside Heights , the proceeds to go to Harlem redevelopment . " Christ , that 's a cute idea , " bellowed Woody , and Brian had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority sport . Nothing Brian could do seemed to attract the best minds on campus  --  well , even he was getting a bit bored with Ibn-Saud . Meanwhile , the new Zen masters cackled at the club 's earnest efforts , and Woody said , " You 're playing , Casey , it 's all you can do . " Be nice to impress old Woody . Crucifixion and resurrection might just do it . By spring , Turn Left had become pretty much a social club . Brian rented a clubhouse out of subscriptions and all kinds of non-political people began dropping in with tennis rackets . " When are you having your first tea dance ? " cabled Woody  --  telegrams being their new hostility gag . " You really like me , I mean , deep down , do n't you ? " Brian asked Kline the next time they met . " No , " said Woody . " Deep down , it 's worse . " Still , Woody was his political conscience . In a last effort to be serious , Brian called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a real student government ,  |p207sort  of a shadow administration to haunt the real one . " The last refuge of feudalism , " he told them , in that lovely musicalvoice . " A campus consists mostly of students  --  so naturally , they 're on the bottom . They have no voice at all . The faculty is in the middle , so they 're allowed a little squeaky voice , but no power . Then you have the magnates , the trustees , call them absentee landlords , ' with no connection with education whatever , nothing but their fleecy pigskin wallets . " " To save you having to make a speech  --  I do n't want to run a university , " said one of the new members . " And I do n't want to run a hotel either . Being a guest is better , believe me . " " How do you feel about prisons ? " said Brian . It stopped the sniggers like hiccoughs . Quick dirty shots were sometimesbest . " Anyway , I 'm not talking about running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " And the greater glory of Casey , " shouted Woody . Shut up , you fool . I 'm doing this to impress you . " Look , Kline , why do n't you play your old records at your own meetings ? You can be sure of not being interrupted there . " " Numbers game , " said Woody . " You 're boasting about your big fat membership again . " " Yeah , what you call a numbers game , we call democracy . Listen , Kline , we happen to have a subject tonight and we 'd like to talk about it , O.K. ? The subject is student government . " " We already have a student government , " whinnied somebody.  | " You 're referring to the Toothless Wonder , I believe . Look  --  I 'm talking about power . " " Bet your ass you are , " said Kline . " Students do n't have real power , " said Zeke Snyder . " So why pretend they do ? What kind of progressive-school charade you playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , and the next . But soon they were arguing with each other , and the meeting spun out of control . The magic was n't working worth a damn . " Order , order , " he shouted . A pause , and then another roar of argument . God , they were maddening . Some clown was talking about women in the dormitories . Somebody else wanted to know where he could park his car during gym class . That sense of a monster rally with the hundred-footflag behind him and one spirit in front of him had evaporated into meaningless student babble . " Order . " No pause this time , no chance to use his weapons . Goddamnit to hell . " Shut up , " he screamed . " Temper , temper , " said Woody . " I adjourn the meeting , " he said and walked stiffly off the platform , trying to contain his suppurating rage , trying not to look like a stage villain thwarted by John Doe . Nobodypaid any attention . He headed as calmly as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He resigned from the Turn Left Society next day . It was true what they said about intellectuals  --  all sexlessp209playboys , using their brains like water pistols . He was especiallydisgusted with himself for having taken their admirationseriously : admiration was just another fad around here . Vanity , my son . Anyway , looking at things more coolly . There were no real politics on campus , because nobody had real interests . It was like playing poker withoutmoney . He concentrated on his studies and on plans to get into law school . Then , a place in the cabinet . No messing around . Being funny was already a little harder , drier than it used to be  --  a safety valve , consciously resorted to . As a junior , he understood why they called some jokes sophomoric : giggle jokes , sloppy as sophomore drinking . He hated Columbia now . People like Kline could beat you at Columbia , because they did n't play for money . He still lived at home , damnit , and his mother picked up after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was n't much he could do about it . As long as he lived , old ladies would want to carry him up the stairs . It was over a year since he 'd hit one with his elbow . Real maturity . " You forgot to dust the desk , " he told his mother . If she was going to tidy for him , she might as well do it right . She was expert by now at dusting around him as he worked . Being slaved over was a mark of kings and cripples . It 's how you look at it . " Watchit , Mother . " She was trying to dust under his papers . " You 're disturbing my chaos . " She did as she was told . " And do n't be so meek about it , " he said . " You do n't have to take that stuff fromp210me . " She smiled uncertainly . Long hours of kidding , hectoring , talking half to oneself , had altered their relationshipsomehow . Gradually , unnoticeably , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her knees so much was what did it . " What do you want me to be when I grow up ? " he asked facetiously . " Happy , " she said , quicker than he expected . " Is that all ? " " A good Catholic man . And happy . " " What do you think Father wants me to be ? " " I think he 'd like you to do well at something . " " Is that all ? " His mother paused . She was almost dusting his hands by now . Look , we do n't analyze each other , dear , except on very special occasions . " I think he wants you to be a great man , " she said vaguely . " Why ca n't he be one himself ? " " I do n't know . He is one in his way . " " No he 's not . Come on , Mother . What happens to people ? He 's a talented guy . A witty guy . Yet he has n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's just a hack architect now . " He held up a hand to silence protest . " He does n't read anything any more . All he ever says is , I think I 'll turn in now , busy day tomorrow . ' Is this something that just happens to men ? Do they all crawl into a corner and die ? Will I get to be like that ? " " I do n't think so . " She looked as if she wanted to getp211out of here , to get away from this talk . " He works very hard . " " Yeah , but he does n't get anywhere . You know when I think he gave up ? Around the time I got polio . And he did n't want me to go to Salt Rock . It was like he 'd lost his nerve . " It was very bad form at the Caseys , taking oneself too seriously . To suppose that he was the cause of his father 's decline  --  supposing his father had declined  --  was insupportablepresumption . Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't want you to go to Salt Rock ? Have you any idea what he went through to get you to Salt Rock ?  --  he was already working eighteen hours a day to pay for specialists and physiotherapists and all . Yes , he 'd be up all night with his drawings sometimes . Things were quite strained around here . He even drank a little to keep his strength up . Of course that does n't work , you know , and do n't you ever try it ... " Oh Jesus . " I think he was so relieved when that was over that perhaps he has n't been quite so ambitious since . " Oh double Jesus . Shut up . Do n't tell me now . About your sacrifices , about my own callousness . Or about how the game was fixed and the victories meaningless . I honestlydo n't think I can stand it . His mother looked at him : she must see a furious face , the skin screaming . She said , " Is anything wrong ? " Nothing . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm supposed to . You 've brought him top212me in your mouth , like a dead bird . Only , you 're dead too . Yeah , Brian Casey has cut a swath on his way to the familythrone . His mother edged away and resumed dusting , busier than ever.  |p215The  street had n't changed : the wallI was still straight and the houses looked like a row of grandfather chairs . The apartment could n't have changed much either . It still had a forties look to it , a greyness deeper than dust , Brian Casey 's log cabin . They do n't build them like they used to . The sofa was worn to a thread , but there was a mobile over by the upright piano that got us up to the fifties , I guess , and a leather chair you could n't get out of without help . I could almost see Brian 's wheelchair in the doorway , and the two parents looking at him with strained smiles . I was n't that interested in them right then , they were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more youthful and with-it of the two , with richp216white hair and an unlined face . But his style was as dated as the apartment . I also sensed an old Irish politician in there somewhere , or maybe I was reading that in : anyway , a dishonest charm . He did n't drink any more , according to my sources , but he made you think about drinking . BeatriceCasey looked older than her husband , as if she took trouble right on the face instead of wherever he took it , but most noticeably she looked starved for someone to talk to . Well , I get that feeling about most women her age . At that point , it was just a job . I talked with them at length about Brian 's conquest of polio . I was there officially to work on a campaign biographyin which conquests of polio are very much the thing . When I hooked up again with Brian in Indiana , he was sarcastic about that , said that it was a fake and he did n't want to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you conquer polio  --  you just have it . " But I insisted on putting it in . We had to do something with it . Besides that , there 's a personal problem here . The only sickness I ever had myself was the measles , when I was seven , and so I have an unholy respect for pain and disease , and I find it impossible to believe that polio could have been quite the casual experience he describes . Anyway , I laid it on medium-thick in the campaign biography , and he laughed and said , " Your book made me cry . But believe me , Sam  --  " And he told me his stories of Salt Rock and the leeches with bitter high spirits , reminding me a little of one of those GI 's of his at Salt Rock , trying to make his young listener sick.  |p217I  am , of course , the young listener , Sam Perkins from Newton , Mass. , guessing what it was like to be growing up in 1945 , or maybe trying not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashions , phony nostalgia , cars . It ca n't have felt that different . People did n't go around thinking , This is 1945 and this year we 're dancing the jitterbug and readingA Tree Grows in Brooklyn , or whatever the hell they were doing . They just did it . It is n't important to Casey anyway . He is definitely not a decor man . The campaign biography came and went . It was reviewedalong with eight others in the Big Paper , and the man said , Well , it 's more honest than some . I allowed that Senator Casey lost his temper and swore a bit , took a drink and hated football . Honesty was a big thing in our campaignand that kind of ersatz revelation was the way we did it . ( In fact , Casey loved football , but he thought it good for the public to confront a politician who did n't . ) After the puff-job was done , Casey said , Let 's get togethersome day and do a real book about me . And in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by now I sometimesfeel , who needs you , Casey ? I have the warp of his soul so well from listening to him in cars and airplanes and both of us half asleep in hotel rooms that I can tell the truth far better than he ever could . Call it presumption or ghost writer 's revenge , but nobody knows a man the way his speechwriter does . One other thing I should warn you about , and then I 'll get out of the way . I once dropped out of a creative-writingcourse at Harvard . The teacher said , " You 've got top218make up your mind between Raymond Chandler and Edith Wharton ; and whatever you decide , do n't ever again try to tell a story from more than one point of view . " I saw what he was getting at and I went straight into politics . We were looking desperately for a candidate that year as usual . It was my first crack at the vote , and I did n't realize that one was always looking desperately for a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we were concerned , and if we did n't find our man , probably the last one . Grim . Solemnly my friends and I stalked the state capitols , interviewing any charlatan or windbag willing to give time to a bunch of politically illiterate undergraduates . I formed a loathing then and there for minor politicians , who seemed as superficial as actors and nowhere near as entertaining , and who were at their absolute worst with children . No black man ever saw more condescension on the hoof than we did that winter . Nor do I ever wish to hear again a sermon on patience and how there are no easy solutions . At the same time , I formed a grudging admiration for the stars , the ones who could charm the socks off you in the length of time it takes to shake out of the next urinal . These may turn up on any side of any issue , and in my slightly older opinion are a bloody menace and should be banned from public life . Washington was a bit better . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , and less encrustedin grey-faced hangers-on . At first , we were certain we would find our man here . The four most promising of them were thrillingly blunt with us , firing off opinions that would surely have shocked their constituents out of their tennis shoes . Washington was so unreal , and they were so buffered with immunity , they could say anything they liked . Until that is , we got to the Issue . That was something on which even a minor senator might be quoted on the front page . A look of calculated vagueness came over our boys , then the patience sermon and allusions to top-level briefings . If we knew what they knew . This took out two of them , two of the best . Since they had a real shot at the Presidency , they would n't take the one chance that would make it possible . At this writing , they 're both still waiting , a little farther back in the pack than before . This left us with Senators Jenkins and Casey . Jenkins had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak out on the Issue and be guaranteed no hearing at all . A soft-on-Communism charge hung limply on him , and nobody could be bothered to remove it . Needless to say , he seemed ready to run at a moment 's notice . Casey had the opposite trouble . He was , at first glance , too slick , too good to be true . He had New York-power base to burn . He 'd made some money of his own somewhere . And he 'd come out on the Issue at just the right time  --  not too early with the cranks , or too late with the schemers . He was a star all right , young , presumably dy/namic ( who ever heard of a young listless politician ? ) , handsome , with a look of stoic endurance that he 'd obviouslyearned  --  notice the slight way he shuffles his legs , must be very painful for him . In researching Casey 's past , I talked to a couple of old polio hands , and they said that that was one thing they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a violation of the code and made him a bad man . But then they did n't know politics . Also , they were terrific polio snobs . Nobody knew but them . " Excuse me for not rising , " said the senator . " Hm , all right , of course . " We grunted with alarm . He asked what he could do for us , and we said , Run for President on the Issue . We were down to our last senator , and our finesse was shot to hell . The bastards had worn us out . " Well , I 'd need a little louder demand than that , would n't you say ? " " Sure , sure . But would you be interested ? " We named our groups , and they sounded pretty silly in a senator 's office , but he nodded and said , " It 's a start . I think student politics is going to have a good year . Anyonelike a cigarette ? " He flashed a silver case . " Only tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tufts , eh ? That 's a pretty good concentration . Could you deliver New England for me ? " I guess we tittered . We had learned our political mannersand recognized that heavy joshing style , the language of the heart for politicians . Casey almost made it attractive , though not quite . He had the voice  --  a touch of thep221New York streets , mixed with your favorite professor 's intonations : impossible by now to tell which was laid on which . And of course , he was more intelligent than the others . " It 's a tempting suggestion . But you people would have to promise you would n't just play at it . You 'd have to go out and find yourself a coalition and bring it back in here , kicking and screaming in a sack . And I never met a coalitionthat was n't revolting . Union jackals and black con men and students  --  wait till you see the students you 'd get . Not little ladies and gentlemen like yourselves . " " Yeah , well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any decently raised child to plug into that sewer . " " Are n't you busy ? " I asked . " I mean , I hate to take up your time . " " No , that 's all right . I like to talk . " He smiled at me . Down boy ! " Leave when you get tired . There are n't many people here in Hellfire Swamp who really like politics . Gossip , now that 's something else . " We were charmed , flattered , sold for life . He canceled two appointments , and made funny cracks about the dignitariesinvolved . Then a not-so-funny one . " Senator Smitherskeeps a camera in his asshole to catch the perverts . " Wrong joke for this group . Sold , unsold . As if he wanted to sell us all over again . You liked me as a nice guy , now try me as a rat . Let 's get down to essences here . Trying to keep cool as the hot charm poured over my head . Somethingdisturbing about his lunging playfulness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thisp222for us ? First impressions hopelessly mixed . Shadow on long Irish face . He 's lonely . He 's playing with us . My sick liberal humility . Maybe he really likes us . I do n't know anybody who knows how to meet celebrities properly , even minor ones . Let 's face it , what I mainly cared about that day was what he thought of me . " I 'm sorry . I 'm in a silly mood . I had lunch with the President . " He was looking at me again . My face had told him something . Uncanny . " Would you like to be President ? " I asked . " I honestly do n't know , " he said . We left , dazzled by this routine display of political sex , our first , his nth . We could have him . All we had to do was perform one trivial little task , like carrying all the grains of rice in the kingdom up Pike 's Peak . " Mr. Perkins , " he said to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . " It was n't magic , of course , but a very old trick . I was n't the brightest of the bunch , but henceforth I thought I was . Also , that we were mystically tuned in to each other , whether I liked him or not . Our group did not get Casey to run  --  we could n't have elected a mayor of Worcester  --  but his availability became known eventually , and a coalition just as hairy as the one he predicted began to form , and the country had a candidate on the Peace Issue , as it presenteditself that year . Politicians ' memories , my foot . He held my hand a min/ute , and my elbow too , as if to say , I would n't be doing all this if I did n't remember you , would I ? " Perkins , " I said . " Yes , Perkins , that 's right . " " Job , " I said . He could smile and think simultaneously like no one I ever saw . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . I lost them someplace . " " Excellent . You have the makings of a politicianalready . " He released my hand , which sank back to my side , more dead than alive . He later told me that he got that grip from pushing a wheelchair . But I figured it was from trying to prove there was nothing wrong with his hand . That 's the kind of difference of interpretation you 'll find right along . " The only thing that bothers me is that you may be too much of a politician . I see you 've cut your hair . That 's a bad sign in a young man . " " I 'm sorry . " " There are two possible theories about you , Perkins . Maybe more . Either you 're an opportunist , who dropped the rags and feathers of your generation the moment you were offered a respectable job . Or else , you never belonged in those rags at all , but wore them to escape attention . Maybe you 'd really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fraud , Perkins ? " I hoped to Christ I knew what he was getting at . Job interviews were like walking on fiery eggshells . " I 'll bet I know why you asked that , Senator . You 're testing my wit and resource , right ? " The smile . " Maybe that 's it . Would you get one of those bottles and make yourself a drink ? " I went over to his
