txt A rape victim with her mother standing close beside a balding detective . A thief and his girlfriend holding hands . The mother of a boy who does n't believe he could murder . The family of a man who disappeared until they found out he was in jail . A witness nervous with his friends , wondering if he 'll be able to open his mouth when he takes the stand . A waitress looking for her probation officer . the versions of what happened . By 9 o'clock the halls are teeming . There is a crowd outside Violence Court . The big doors where " Bishops of lath St. " has been carved into the wood swing open as people peek in to see if the morning call has begun . Bob , the starter on the first floor , towers over the crowd as he shouts out the elevator numbers , and the bronze , dusty doors open and shut heading up their seven  --  story shafts toward the courtrooms . The prisoners are already there  --  delivered early in the morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they sit and wait for their chance in court and the food man to bring them hot coffee and bologna sandwiches . Seventeen courtrooms filling up with people . All there because of trouble . And all there to tell their stories . UP ON THE seventh floor , Criminal Court Judge Earl Strayhorn sits on the bench . In the heavy stone courtroom people have taken their seats . A bailiff reminds the men to remove their wide brim hats . A man in the back sits patiently . He 's come all the way up from Missouri by bus to get his brother out on bail . Two little girls brought by their aunt to see their father in court get anxious and get their thighs slapped when they slip off the bench . A murder trial is going on . One of the three murders a night in Chicago and lost in most people 's recollections of 19 months ago when it happened . Lost except to the sister of Stephen Dambrauskas whose brother never got on the bus at Erie and Halsted Streets . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he waited for the bus . Lost except to the family of J.T. Thomas who is charged with the man 's murder . They sit in the first bench on the right , two rows in front of the victim 's sister . J.T. THOMAS sits at the lawyers table in a green suit and shows no emotion . The jury 's eyes are fastened on the lawyers who are giving final ' arguments . It is the third day of testimony , and all the jurors wear sweaters because the air conditioning is too cold . Bruce , the young defense attorney , is giving his final plea . It was Malcolm Price , the state 's key witness and Thomas ' former buddy , who really shot Stephen Dambrauskas that night , he says . Malcolm Price lied on the stand . Price too has been charged with the murder . But by testifying against James , he will have the charges dismissed . His pointing a finger at Thomas as the trigger man , Bruce says , " was to take the noose off his own neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Thomas did it . Thomas says Malcolm Price did it . " If there is any doubt in your minds , " argues the defense lawyer , you must find my client not guilty . " MARK ZUBOR , one of the two prosecutors , stands up to rebutt . He points out that James Thomas was involved in an armed robbery . " If you believe there was a robbery taking place it does n't matter who pulled the trigger , " Zubor says . " They are both guilty of it . Even if you think Malcolm Price did the shooting , everyone involved is guilty of the act . " Even if you think Malcolm Price should not be a state 's witness , that is irrelevant . You may not like it . Both of them are robbers . But that 's the man ( he 's pointing to Thomas you have to consider . " THE TRIAL Is over . It is now up to the five women and seven men of the jury . The doors are locked and Judge Strayhom issues jury instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young defense attorney goes into the hall to have.a smoke . He is nervous . He says , his stomach is jumping . J. T. 's family is nervous , too . They stand looking out the window in the hall  --  over the store tops and church steeples and factory chinnneys  --  at the skyscrapers downtown , faraway in the horizon from the exiled criminal court building . The judge begins his call . There are 25 names  --  the usual number . Twenty-five men back in his lockup who 've been waiting for their chance to get a continuance or make bail or have their lawyers make a motion they do n't understand . Twenty-five different stories . Most of them are poor and have public defenders . Most are charged with rape or armed robbery or burglary . Or , like J.T. Thomas , they 've been charged with murder . Most will not make bond . WILLIE McCULLOUGH . Ester Freeman . SaNatore Polito . James Essex . They come in one by one as the . clerk calls out their names and the bailiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some rub their eyes , as if they were entering another world . Some wave to friends they have n't seen for weeks . " Hey baby , " mouths one silently to a girl in the front row . " You get any letter ? " Some stand in T-shirts and slacks , their heads bowed before the judge . Reduction of bail denied . Discovery mo into his chambers behind the " No Admittance " sign . BACK FROM LUNCH , the call goes on . And on . Lee Rance charged with armed robbery . Sam Kimbrough whose wife came to pay his bail . Bernard Johnson , who , midget-like in height , stands with his lawyer and gets a continuance . Thirty-five seconds in and out . It is not yet time for his trial . A young ? woman is called before the judge . She ambles up to the bench from the back of the courtroom . Weeks earlier , the judge had found her guilty of aggravated bltery for beating up another woman . " Do you wish to say anything before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I don't. have anything to say , " she whispers back . " Well , you 're lucky you 're not up here on murder , " says Judge Strayhorn . " You could have killed that woman . Your problem is you have a bad temper . But taking into consideration your previous history , I will place you on five years probation . You are going to have a difficult time on probation with this court because you have no self discipline . " YOU HAVE USED UP all your credit now . If you do n't change your ways I will send you to the penitentiary . You are going to have to learn to keep your mouth shut and walk away from a situation that could lead to trouble . " I want you to go back to school or get a job instead of lying on your back getting pregnant and getting ADC . Do you understand ? " The woman , who has three children and a fourth one on the way , nods . The judge calls James Anderson , who runs Strayhom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make ADC a haven while on probation so he can go out and get a bigger check , " he tells Anderson . " If she gets pregnant again after this baby I want to know about it . All right ? " " Yes judge , " says Anderson who directs his new responsibility to sit down and wait a minute . THEN ANDERSON , with a smile , presents the judge with discharge papers for a man named Clyde who the judge put on probation five years ago . He has not been in trouble since . The judge beams . " Now these are the papers I like to sign , " he says . " Tell the man good luck . " Another trial begins . It is mid-afternoon . This case , attempted murder and armed robbery . The taxi driver who was shot in the head and robbed can not testify because of the bullet still lodged in his brain . The defendant , Raymond Ivy , is so small he is dwarfed in the defendant 's chair . It is a bench trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first witness is the arresting detective . " LIE . LIE . AI N'T doing nothing but lying up there , " mumbles a woman who must be the defendant 's mother . " He was home all that night sleeping . Were n't no holding up no taxi . " The prosecuting attorneys in the Thomas case are in their offices now awaiting the jury 's verdict . Out in the hall , Bruce , the young defense attorney is pacing . The jury is still out and it 's been over three hours . A late afternoon stillness has settled over the seventh floor . Paper cups jam the ashtrays in the hall and cigaret butts line the floor . Only a few elevators can be heard clanking up and down their shafts . The J.T. Thomas family ambles aimlessly in the halls . THE JUDGE is in his chambers now . " That girl will do OK on probation , " says the judge , sitting relaxed at his desk , his robes off . " She knows my reputation . They call me Judge Son-of-abitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind being called a son-of-a-bitch , but I do mind being called unfair . " I think I send someone to the penitentiary as the last means of punishment . But I 'm no sucker . I do n't give taps on the wrist . I do n't give second chances . But I 'll give them a first chance with probation . And the probation Mr. Anderson and I have works  --  because of him and because I 'm a sonof-a-bitch . I do n't make it easy . " AS A JUDGE it 's hard not to become cynical . Sometimes sitting up on the bench you feel that life is n't worth the price of meat in a store , it 's so cheap . Then something beautiful happens that 's like the dew on the daisies and as sweet as a morning breeze . Like Clyde , the man whose discharge papers I signed today . " Here 's a man I found guilty of manslaughter . He killed a man . I put him on probation and he 's never been in trouble since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 a week working construction now and his employers say he 's a go-getter . Something like that comes along and makes you feel great . Because of him . I feel good today . A BAILIFF leans in the door . " Judge , " he says , " you 've got a verdict . " " Call in the lawyers , " the judge says . " We the jury , find the defendant , James Thomas , ( The Thomas family leans forward on their bench . Thomas himself stares at the clerk who is reading the verdict . And Bruce , the defense attorney , fidgets in his seat. " guilty of murder . " Thomas ' girlfriend , a small woman with orange curls around her forehead ; starts to sob . The men in his family exchange glances and then look down at the floor . Thomas does not move . Judge Strayhorn thanks the jury and the court rises as they leave the box . Thomas stands and opens his palms to them . Then turns to his family , shrugs ; opens his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is led away and his family disappears out through the court doors . The young defense attorney is downcast and walks slowly after his client . Back in the jury room , the woman jurors , all elderly , break into tears . The men are somber . The judge goes back to talk with them . " I TOLD THEM it is probably the most distasteful thing they 've ever had to do in their lives  --  find another man guilty of murder , " the judge says later. : " But , there 's nothing more important outside of the armed forces in war than having to judge your neighbor . I told them to tell their friends , their neigh= bors  --  to preach about it because the American judicial system works . " " The loneliest place in the world is that jury room . A judge knows how they feel because he has to do it every day . They can be the biggest damn rabbler  --  users around but something happens to an American when he gets into that jury box . " Somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the right decision . I have had 100 juries and I can say I only disagreed with four of them . There 's a metamorphosis that takes place inside them . Bias on race and sex and age are twisted out of them and all those diverse personalities are molded together into one single response . They bite the bullet and they find wells of strength and try very hard to be fair in judging another man . But it is not easy . That 's why those women were crying . " ONE OF THE prosecutors , Terry Ekl , stops in chambers before he leaves for home . He is happy with the decision he has just won . Behind him , coming in quietly is the defense attorney who flops exhausted into a chair . The judge and Ekl rehash the case a minute before Ekl leaves . Then , Stray-horn turns to the defense attorney . " Yes , counsel , " he says . " Yes sir , " Bruce says . " I just came to . . . to say good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your man the brzi you could , " says Strayhorn . " He wanted his day in court and he got it . Now the jury has spoken . No one could have done better , not even F. Lee Bailey . Do n't you feel bad . " " IT WAS MY first murder before a jury , " says the defense attorney softly , " Well , you were fighting with a short stick , " says the judge . " And you had those people on the jury thinking . They were out quite a while . It 's part of your experience now . Do n't look back . " " Thanks , judge , " says the attorney . " I could have had a different outlook the rest of my life . I just had to come back and talk to you . Thanks for the encouragement . " " You go home and relax now , " says the judge . " Yah , " says the lawyer . " I have n't slept in a couple of days . THE LAWYER WALKS out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge puts on phis jacket to leave . It is dinner time and somewhere outside on Califon. ; nia Avenue church chimes ring out . , There is only one elevator left in operation , heaving up and down on its cal bles . It 's doors bang open for the judge . There are three other juries out in the building , locked up in jury room deliberating what will happen to some man in some lockup sweating out the wait alone with a pack of cigarets . " Three other juries still out , " says Bruno , the elevator operator , as he hits the first floor . " Could be a long night . " " Yes , Bruno , " says the judge . " And it 's been a long day . "
