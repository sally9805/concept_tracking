The weather was damp and cloudy as the Soviet Union 's No. 1 soccer fan took his seat in Moscow 's Lenin Stadium last week to watch the hometown Torpedoes defeat the Kiev Dynamos , 1 to 0 . But as political observers on both sides of the Iron Curtain immediately realized , Communist Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev was also playing a game all his own . Only two days earlier , Brezhnev had abruptly canceled his plans to visit Bucharest for the long-delayed signing of a new Soviet-Rumanian friendship pact , pleading a " catarrhal ailment . " His subsequent appearance at the soccer match was designed to expose the respiratory disorder for exactly what it was : a calculated snub to Rumania 's independent-minded Communist Party Leader Nicolae Ceausescu . <P> Strictly Protocol . Brezhnev turned his ceremonial duties over to Premier Aleksei Kosygin . The Rumanians countered by sending out a welcoming delegation headed by Premier Ion Maurer , Kosygin 's exact equivalent in government rank but not in real power or party stature . Crowds lining the Soviet Premier 's parade route were perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bucharest last year . Ceausescu stayed away from the formal events , including his own government 's official reception and the treaty signing . He entertained Kosygin at one luncheon and spent three hours in private talks with him . As one Bucharest official noted : " We observed protocol as is befitting a sovereign nation . " <P> Sovereignty was indeed the heart of the matter and the chief reason for the fact that the friendship pact , which supersedes a 20-year treaty begun in 1948. remained unsigned for two years . At first the Rumanians held off in protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . Later it was the Soviets who delayed , partly to express their displeasure over Nixon 's visit but more importantly to try to persuade the Rumanians to accept a new paragraph recognizing the Brezhnev Doctrine , which justifies Soviet intervention anywhere in the " socialist commonwealth . " Ceausescu rightly saw the doctrine as a threat to his foreign policy of " active coexistence " with both friends and enemies of the Kremlin , and adamantly refused to agree toil . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union in the event of " an armed attack by a state or group of states . " Tass , the official Soviet news organization , insists that this would obligate Rumania to help defend against any Chinese attack on Russia ; the Rumanians , who have remained determinedly neutral in the Sino-Soviet struggle , point out that the preamble of the treaty limits military obligations to the area covered by the Warsaw Pact - which does not extend beyond Eastern Europe .
