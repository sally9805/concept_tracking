Protecting patient records <P> While recuperating from an operation for prostate cancer , a middle-aged Chicago machinist learns that a loan company is inquiring among his neighbors whether he can ever work again . In Hartford , Conn. , a recent college graduate hears that she has been rejected for a teaching job by a private school because it has somehow found out that her mother is under psychiatric care . In New York City , women who have registered for abortions at a private clinic are besieged by phone calls from right-to-life advocates trying to dissuade them . <P> These typical cases represent violations of one of medicine 's sacred trusts : the patient 's right to privacy . Under a credo that goes back to the Hippocratic oath , a physician is required to keep silent about what he is told or learns of a patient 's condition . But lately the tradition is being more honored in the breach . <P> The problem is not loose-lipped doctors but the increasing complexity of medical care . No longer is all treatment provided at home or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinics , where nurses , lab technicians , therapists , pharmacists and other functionaries join with doctors in building mountains of medical information about the patient . To complicate matters , the patient does not pick up the hospital tab directly . That is done by insurance companies or government agencies , so-called third parties , all of whom claim a legitimate right to look into what they are paying for . <P> Even if patients object to violations of their privacy , they can not prevent them since hospitals and insurance companies commonly insist that patients sign " any and all " release forms as a precondition of treatment . These give the institutions virtually a free hand to distribute information from a patient 's files . Nor do the limited restrictions that exist provide much assurance of secrecy . Information can often be ferreted out of computer memories by anyone with access to a terminal . The curious can also enter busy hospital record rooms by simply passing themselves off as doctors . Besides learning about a patient 's current ailment , the snoops may pick up potentially damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouts with venereal disease , drug addiction or alcoholism , or a family history of mental illness or cancer . Easily copied by duplicating machine and then spread , this sensitive information may eventually appear on the desks of credit and loan officers , personnel chiefs or even college admissions boards .
