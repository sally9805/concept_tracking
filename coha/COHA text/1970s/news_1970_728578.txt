txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 40 Letters to the Editor of The Times Militant Students To the Editor : Arson , vandalism and destruction of school property are crimes . Attacking duly appointed officers of the law with bricks , stones , Molotov cocktails , fists , and in any other violent manner is a crime . Destruction of the lifework of various professors is a tragedy . Because of the permissiveness of school professors and administrators , very few of the many perpetrators of these crimes have been punished in any way . It is not at all surprising that the truculence and audacity of the students has now gotten completely out of hand . It should have surprised no one that at last the inevitable occurred , and a group of law enforcers turned on the group that was attacking them . During this long period of lawlessness and senseless destruction the moderate citizens of the country have waited patiently for leaders of the Administration to speak strongly against the anarchistic actions of the militant leaders of the student uprisings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feel that the recent remarks of President Nixon were well directed . The militant students , in completely disrupting the educational system , are destroying their own future . Particular sympathy is due the large majority of students who do not approve of the tactics of the minority , but whose future is being equally jeopardized by the closing of so many colleges and universities before the end of the school term . H. H. COOKE Setauket , L. I. , May 8 , 1970 ? Misunderstood Strike To the Editor : Upon reading your May 7 editorial " Making Protest Count " I was struck by an overwhelming sense of despair at the inexcusable lack of comprehension which it showed toward the national student strike . To say that the universities have been " shut down " is in many cases a flagrantly warped miscoinprehension of what has been effected . I have never attended so many timely , informative and exciting lectures , dehates and meetings in my sixteen years in the academic world . At Smith College , at Mt . Holyoke College , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and administration are fervently involved in constructive attempts to ameliorate one of the most frightening and critical situations of our lives . The schools are not " shut down " ( except in the most rigid academic sense of that term ) , but have simply redirected the curriculum to confront what we consider a deplorable disregard for the interests and desires of the intellectual communities of this nation . Beneath all the rhetoric , the emotionalism and the gestures , there lies only the reality of hope transformed into action . I have never felt lonelier or less understood than at this moment . I have never been prouder of my college . PETER COBB SAWYERS ' 72 Amherst , Mass. , May 7 , 1970 ? Agnew Comment To the Editor : The recent intemperate statements by the Vice President of the United States against President Kingman Brewster of Yale leads me to remark that although I had not realized that Mr. Brewster had criticized the electoral system in this country . I can now very well understand why he might have . E. J. BOELL Ross Granville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 29 , 1970 ? Police Protection To the Editor : Do you think it possible that some of the spoiled scholastic brats will have learned that there is something very appealing about a " pig " now that they want the very useful creature to save their hides from a perhaps well-deserved beating ? Or do you think these students will be as unappreciative and abusive as ever when the construction workers return to constructing instead of teaching some of these bums a lesson in respect and patriotism ? JOSEPH KLEE New York , May 9 , 1970 ? Study Data on Cancer To the Editor : Recently you published a full-page advertisement from the Tobacco Institute questioning the scientific validity of a study by Drs . Auerbach and Hammond on cigarette smoking in dogs , which was presented by the American Cancer Society . There has been a mass of evidence , statistical , epidemiological and biological , that cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer in man . The culminating evidence in the recent Auerbach-Hammond study demonstrates that dogs can get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study are based solely upon the information and interpretations provided by the press . " The facts are that the findings of the study were made public at a scientific meeting of the American Cancer Society . This was an open meeting to which physicians , other scientists and representatives of research and educational institutions were invited . One of the reasons for a prompt presentation to scientists and the public was the significant data obtained in support of the theory that the less tar and nicotine in the mainstream of smoke , the less the risk of emphysema and lung cancer . For years segments of the ' cigarette industry have attacked warnings of the dangers of cigarette smoking and protested that no one had been able to produce lung cancer in abi7 mals with cigarette smoke . This has now been done . The Tobacco Institute attacks the American Cancer Society for " its use of publicity techniques . " This comes from an industry that for years has relied on publicity and advertising to obscure the fact that cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed in appoint a committee to review the findings in the AuerbachHammond study . This request is without precedent in the scientific community , and we refused the request . There has never been any restriction against individual scientists visiting the Veterans Administration Hospital in Ease Orange , N. J. , where the work was done , and reviewing the research with Drs . Auerbach and Hammond . A number of distinguished scientists have already reviewed the findings. , . Because of the great public interest in the link between cigarette smoking and lung cane cer , and because of the adver &; tising campaign initiated by Or* Tobacco Institute to cast doutz on the validity of the dog study , the A.C.S. is requesting the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service fo appoint an impartial scientific body to conduct an analysis of the Auberbach-Hammond study data .
