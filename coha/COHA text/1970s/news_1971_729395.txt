txt He 's a new environment issue  --  a fiery little red ant from South America with a penchant for high-rise living . An impressive array , of conservationist groups ? allied with the federal government 's new Enviionmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , have come to the defense of the tiny fire ant , which jumped ship in Mobile , Ala. , around 1917 and in the years since has been busy infesting a large portion of the Southeastern United States . The conservationists , charge the . United States Department of Agriculture with overkill in its battle against the little insect , // *Dixie malady : ant-spray debate // The ant defenders recently lost an important round in court . As a result , some 7 million acres in eight Southern states is being sprayed from the air with a chemical called Mirex . Though it does cause some direct crop damage , the main reason state and federal agriculturalists are after the fire ant is its habit of frequenting high-rise living quarters . In fields , fire-ant mounds average 11/2 to 2 feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On frequently mowed suburban lawns , the mounds reach only 6 to 8 inches . Yet when the insects moved into the Atlantic area in 1962 , the state Department of Agriculture got some 15,000 calls for help in just a few days . So the B-25 's took to the air , spraying Mirex-treated bait over most of the metropolitan area ? even where it was n't wanted . Since that time , anti-Mirex forces have rallied . Laboratory animals given massive doses of the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide have deteriorated physically . Conclusions drawn from that depend on whether one is pro- or anti-Mirex . The fire ant is caught in the middle . United States District Judge Oliver Gasch recently ruled in Washington , D.C. , that plaintiffs seeking an injunction to halt the Mirex program failed to prove that " irreparable injury " would result from its use . But he did say that Mirex would " significantly affect the quality of the human environment . " Conservationists do n't claim to have proved Mirex harmful beyond doubt . But Dr. John W. Parker , ecologist at Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least restrict its use until more is known . Meanwhile , planes in the air William D. Ruckelshaus , EPA administrator , already has issued a " notice of cancellation " on Mirex as well as on two pesticides of the same family , Aldrin and Dieldrin . But this wo n't take effect for at least a year . Meanwhile , planes are in the air , spraying crumbled corncobs treated with soybean oil and Mirex . Georgia is getting the most , with 4.1 million acres under treatment Mississippi is next , with 2.9 million acres . Carl M. Scott , Georgia 's state entomologist , says the operation , concentrated in the southwest part of the state is closely checked . " We 've been using Mirex since 1961 , and have had a monitoring program all along . There is no residue left , " Mr. Scott asserts . Dr. Parker flatly contradicts this : He charges that Mirex is taken in by creatures that live in the soil and goes on into the food chain . The longevity  --  the " half-life " ? of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until it is , at least the caution light should be on . More care urged Distribution should be on a more " respectful " basis , Dr. Parker contends . The Mirex bait now is sprayed on a " broad spectrum , " he explains , though the ants only get to that which lands near their mounds . And the bait breaks down within 48 hours , having no more effectiveness against the ants but leaving the poison in the soil . Dr. Parker says the bait should be distributed at ground level instead of from the air . Further , he charges , farmers neglect to use the " conventional " and biologically safe method of burning anthills with kerosene , then demand a government program after their land becomes infested . The Georgia State University ecologist urges " much more research , " into both the effects of Mirex and the possibility of an alternative . On the other hand , Mr. Scott says there is " no proof of any damage " from the pesticide . The amount of Mirex used is very small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain of an anthill , illustrates the national quandary over regulation of pesticides . Knowledge of their effects just is n't deep enough to permit unequivocal decisions either by the courts or agencies such as EPA .
