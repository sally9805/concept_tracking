txt Dick Carrothers ' nerves are shot . After five nights of previews , the silken green curtains are about to rise on the Waldo Astoria 's revival of Cole Porter 's brassy musical , " Anything Goes , " and the 27-year-old producer , surrounded by friends and backers , has opening-night jitters . He 's reassured , however , that everyone has enjoyed the roast beef and the nutmegdusted chocolate pudding . And that is half the battle , for this is n't Broadway . It 's dinner theater  --  where , says Jay Barney of Actors ' Equity Association , " a good dinner can carry a bad show , but a lousy dinner will ruin a hit . " As it turns out , Mr. Carrothers ' mostly young cast of 18 puts pizazz into Porter romps like " You 're the Top " and " I Get a Kick out of You , " and the boy-gets-girl farce pleases his audience at least as much as the meal does . Once scorned by legitimate-theater buffs and actors , dinner theaters have taken hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . They 've also earned a reputation for professionalism , and they 've earned profits . Boom Only Beginning " It 's not Shakespeare , " concedes Dennis Hennessy , 32-year-old coproducer of " Anything Goes . " " But the audience is n't coming to be educated and enlightened . They want to walk out of here slapping each other on the back and feeling happy . " Producers Hennessy and Carrothers obviously are happy . In the past two years they have opened two dinner theaters here that critics and other observers think are among the most successful , artistically and financially , in the country . Dinner theater traces back to Rome , where spectators at the Colosseum dined while they watched Christians take on lions . About 15 years ago , businessmen in some Southern towns began putting together dinner-theater packages , often in cavernous barns , using local actors who doubled as waiters . The novelty outweighed the uneven quality of the food and the performance , and dinner theater caught on . Now some 175 dinner theaters are operating , mostly in and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first taste of live theater In them . More actors are employed by dinner theaters now than on the New York stage . The boom really may be only beginning . The road to success in this business so far is poorly spotlighted ; in the past three years or so nearly 50 operations have folded . But two or three new ones pop up each month . By one educated estimate , dinner theaters last year grossed as much as $150 million , compared with Broadway 's take of some $45 million . Pleasing the Little Woman " You can eat , drink and be entertained in one place , and that kind of one-stop shopping really appeals to the basically lazy American , " says Robert P. Vrooman , an insurance broker who heads the Off-Broadway dinner theater here . Also appealing are the prices , ranging around the country from $5.50 to $15 for dinner plus show . Tiffany 's Attic , the first Carrothers-Hennessy theater , charges $7 during the week and $8 on weekends . The price includes everything but drinks , which fetch $1.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters . Successful operators put just as much emphasis on the decor as they do on the food and the show . Frank Matthews , a former submarine officer , has poured about $900,000 into turning a barn and adjoining brick building into the rustic Hayloft dinner theater near Washington , D.C. " The atmosphere is essential , " he says . " The little woman has to really feel she 's being taken out on the town . " It helps to mow the territory . Dick Carrothers and Dennis Hennessy did . Still , it took them four months of wheedling at every cocktail party and society affair in town before they could raise the $120,000 they needed to start work on Tiffany 's Attic , opened in May 1972 . The two , drama graduates of the University of Missouri , first met working on a little-theater production . " We got out into the real world and discovered there were few working opportunities for drama majors , " Mr. Carrothers says , " so we decided to create our own . " When the money ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform a turn-of-the-century commercial laundry into the cozy , 278-seat Tiffany 's Attic . The two partners hold 51% of the stock in a holding company , Dinner Playhouse Inc. , which owns Tiffany 's Attic and the Waldo Astoria . A dozen " angels " own the rest of the stock . Drinks and Daguerreotypes An evening at Tiffany 's Attic starts about 610 , when its mostly middle-aged customers begin to arrive . They enter a main room decorated in deep red with antique-framed daguerreotypes on the walls , and plants and spotlights dangling from high rafters . Tables sit on four tiers to give everybody a clear view of the stage , which rolls into view after buffet steam tables are wheeled away . Once every six to eight weeks , the dinner menu and the show change . On a recent night there was a choice of roast beef , fried chicken or ham , with salad and vegetables . " It 's not a gourmet meal , but it 's tasty , " Mr. Hennessy says . The partners taste each new entree ; it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They hold raw-food costa below $2 a customer . Before the main show , eight waiters and waitresses , all of them music or drama students from nearby colleges , put on a zippy , 15-minute warm-up revue , push the moreexpensive drink " specials " and make subtle plays for tips . The show usually runs about two hours , counting two 15-minute intermissions when staffers push drinks again . They pour an average of 2.5 a customer . Considering the teetotalers , this means some customers guzzle a lot of booze ; but drunkenness seldom is a problem . When they opened Tiffany 's Attic , Messrs . Carrothers and Hennessy expected to run about 75% of capacity . Instead , they filled the house almost every night for a year . Thus buoyed , and learning that competitors were readying for business , they opened the Waldo Astoria last August . It 's in a neighborhood known as Waldo . Bigger and fancier than Tiffany 's Attic , it cost $500,000 to convert from a 1920-era burleague and movie house . Tiffany 's Attic features small-cast comedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldo Astoria mounts large-scale musicals like " The Boyfriend . " Competition has n't hurt . Since the Waldo Astoria opened , it and Tiffany 's Attic have played about 92% sold , on the average . The theaters brought in $1.5 million in 1973 . They 're expected to gross about $2.5 million this year . The partners try to keep 7% to 10% of that as profit . The weekly payroll of 200 full-time and part-time employee , many of whom work only a few days a week , Is about $7,000 . Staging costs run from $3,500 for straight drama to $5,000 or $8,000 for a musical . Advertising takes from $5,000 to $8,000 a month . It seems essential . Ada helped lure Mrs. Thompson C. Grill , of Lake Quintero , Kan. , to Tiffany 's Attic for the first time . She and her husband , a sales vice president for Western Alfalfa Corp. , have returned four times . " Where else can you get a wholesome night of entertainment without all the filth and alutty stuff you see everywhere else nowadays ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions : Neil Simon comedies like " The Odd Couple " and " Plaza Suite , " for example , or small-cast shows ripe with one-liners that sound as though they were written by Simon even if they were n't . Scaled-down versions of shows like " Camelot " and " Fiddler on the Roof " also are standard tare . Many owners fear that departure from the tried and true would invite disaster . But they also fear they could run out of the tried and true . Paying for Big Names " You ca n't be too heavy or experimental , " says Robert Boren , who heads the five-theater Windmill chain in Texas and Arizona . " If there 's a little meat thrown in , fine ; but if it 's all meat you 'll only get the 50 theater buffs in a town of 100,000 . " He cites the reception of the biting " Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " in Phoenix : It weekly drew only 800 patrons , one-third the theater 's usual crowd . Yet " Lion in Winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done well enough in Washington that Hayloft Theater owner Frank Matthews says , " Next year I wo n't be as timid in putting on one or two quality pieces . " Some owners rely on names  --  Eddie Bracken , Sid Caesar , Phyllis Diller , to cite a few recent examples  --  to draw . Dick Carrothers says he would close the shutters before he would pay $1,500 to $4,000 a week for a name actor . " When you have to shell out that much , " he says , " your supporting cast has to be inexpensive 18-year-old kids who gray their hair to play 45-year-olds . " About 75 dinner theaters have signed a union contract with Actors ' Equity , representing 19,000 professionals , Equity minimum wages run from $150 to $178 a week , depending on theater size , although the actual median earnings of Equity actors are closer to $250 a week . Not Subtle , but Fun For actors like Richard Brown , who says he lacks " any burning desires to go to New York , or pretensions to fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Attic and the Waldo , he says , have made him " the first Kansas City actor to work all year round since vaudeville died . " Dinner theater also offers a start for promising hopefuls like 21-year-old Don Whisted . He was working in the mailroom of New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art until he got a part in " Plaza Suite " and in a Cole Porter revue at Tiffany 's Attic . " I 've certainly gained professionally here , " he says . Though some critics brush off dinner theater as so much fluff , others are more benign . Giles M. Fowler , drama editor of the Kansas City Star , says that " it 's not a subtle thing , and it 's not going to give you a transcendent theatrical experience , but there are times when dinner theater entertains the hell out of me . It 's the closest thing to massentertainment theater that we 've ever had in this country . " ? A few dinner theaters have been in business for a dozen years or so . Mr. Carrothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full steam in a city , you should probably only count on a five-year lifespan . " He and Mr. Hennessy are looking for a good place to start a third theater . ( They also are adding extras like midnight concerts and children 's shows , without meals , to their present theaters . ) " Opening a dinner theater Is still a big risk , " Mr. Hennessy says , " but for us it 's the only game in town .
