Few joys are unalloyed any more in an increasingly self-critical age . The cigarette , the fried egg and the bacon , the automobile , the toy with lead-based paint - all have been judged to be as pernicious as they are pleasurable . Now the boom has fallen on the economic boom . Time was when the word connoted something unqualifiedly positive , as in " booming industry " and " boom times . " But because a boom all too often leads to inflation and then to bust , Data Resources Inc. , an economic consulting firm in Massachusetts , has set up a " DRI Boom Monitor " to alert subscribers when a healthy recovery shows signs of turning into an unsustainable boom . <P> This early warning system , made possible by computer analysis of a va riety of indicators , will take the temperature of every economic advance . DRl President Otto Eckstein , a Harvard professor and member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , rates the temperature of the current recovery to be near normal , al though he notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply bottlenecks are be ginning to show up . But the question remains whether the boom index will real ly be able to warn of a dangerously rising temperature before it is already too high to be cooled down .
