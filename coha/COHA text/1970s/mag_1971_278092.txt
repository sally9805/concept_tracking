ONE of the most intriguing Viet Nam documents is an as yet unpublished cable that analysts working on the Pentagon papers studied with fascination . It was sent to President John F. Kennedy in 1961 in response to a proposal from General Maxwell Taylor that the U.S. dispatch 8,000 troops to Viet Nam , ostensibly to work on flood relief . Taylor 's recommendation included using the troops to commit American prestige in Viet Nam , to shore up morale and provide a back-up for the South Vietnamese army and to serve as an advance force for a wider American involvement . The cable argued against the recommendations , reasoning that the U.S. could still walk away from Viet Nam at this early stage , but should Taylor 's proposals be carried out , Washington would be forced to see its commitments through . Such a course , the cable writer warned , would turn a guerrilla struggle into a full-scale war . <P> The surprising author of that cable was former Secretary of State Dean Rusk , the same Rusk of the hawkish eyeball that never blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never changed through the years of escalation . Contrary to his historic image , did he oppose the first loop in the endless spiral into Indochina ? In an interview from his home in Athens , Ga. , Rusk broke his long silence . He told TIME Correspondent Jess Cook that he had " no present recollection " of the cable , but " I might well have written it . " <P> Rusk continued : " In 1961 we were in the middle of the negotiations on Laos . Our hope then , especially after the apparent agreement Kennedy had with Khrushchev in Vienna , was that everyone would get out of Laos , a major step toward peace in Southeast Asia . So I was very reluctant at that period to see us go gung-ho in the area until we saw how that worked out . " Moreover , Rusk said , the level of infiltration was " still very low , " and the Berlin crisis made " a number of us reluctant to make additional commitments in South Viet Nam during that episode . " * <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rusk observed , " I never saw or heard of the study until I read about it in the New York Times . I do n't know the analysts or how they did their writing . I 'm amused at some things , a little irritated at others . " <P> On withdrawal : " Throughout this business , up until the day we left office , President Johnson and myself were not unaware of the fact that one of the alternatives was to get out of there . We 're not village idiots . " <P> On the effects of the papers on Government officials : " If the courts hold that this kind of material can be taken out of Government on this basis and made public , it will bring about major changes in the conduct of Government . My habit was that I did not go around writing a lot of memoranda . I 've been in Government long enough to know it is not a good idea to spread papers all over the landscape . People will just find other ways to proceed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay some cost . "
