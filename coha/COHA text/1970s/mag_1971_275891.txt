THE SHATTERED SILENCE by Zwy Aldouby and Jerrold Ballinger. 453 pages . Coward , McCann &; Geoghegan. $7.95 . <P> Early in 1962 , a mustached man of 37 arrived in Damascus using the name Kamal Amin Taabet . He carried an Argentine passport and claimed to be a Lebanese of Syrian descent returning from an expatriate period in Buenos Aires . Taabet set up as an exporter of furniture and tapestries and managed to make a wide range of friends in the business community , in the army and in the ruling Baath party . Quite innocently , those friends kept him posted on the inside details of everything from Syria 's perennial coups d'etat to the fortifications on the Golan Heights overlooking the Sea of Galilee . <P> Taabet also became an intimate of President Amin al-Hafez , and at the beginning of 1965 was about to be nominated Deputy Minister of Defense . Then , early one January morning , Taabet was arrested by Syrian security officers and exposed as an Israeli agent , a Jew named Eliahu ben Shaul Cohen . Cohen was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impersonate an Arab brilliantly . His arrest ended one of the most audacious careers in the history of espionage . <P> For more than two years , Cohen , who was known as Operative 88 to his superiors in Tel Aviv , had been sending coded intelligence reports almost daily on a clandestine transmitter . He had carefully picked a location in the diplomatic quarter of Damascus , across the street from the general staff headquarters , where his short-wave signal would be lost among those of foreign embassies and the Syrians themselves . <P> Vexations and Rewards . He was caught only because Syrian officials ordered a halt to all broadcasting to check some new Soviet equipment ; the diplomatic corps complied , but Cohen 's lone signal persisted , leading security agents directly to his door . He was tortured , tried for espionage by a military court , convicted and hanged on May 19 , 1965 , before a crowd of more than 10,000 Damascenes in Marjeh Square . <P> Zwy Aldouby , an Israeli journalist now living in the U.S. , has collaborated with the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic life and death . Operative 88 emerges as a far more human figure than the spies in the most sophisticated fiction ; along with a tale of intrigue the book presents the emotional vexations and rewards of practicing the world 's most dangerous profession . In Damascus , Cohen was isolated from family , friends and countrymen . During a brief visit to Israel shortly before his arrest , he told his wife : " I will soon be able to build a villa and stop traveling . " <P> - K.R.J.
