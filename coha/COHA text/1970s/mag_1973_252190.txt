<P> Burundi is a land of luxuriant beauty and berserk violence , torn apart by one of those tribal conflicts that are so elusive to an outsider 's understanding . Determined to uphold a centuries-old feudal hegemony over 3,000,000 Hutu tribesmen , the well-armed Tutsi overlords , who number no more than 600,000 , unleashed a violent pogrom last year . At least 80,000-and perhaps as many as 250,000-Hutus were killed . In May this year the slaughter revived in the southeastern part of the landlocked hill country ( area : 10,747 sq . mi. , smaller than Belgium ) . The latest Tutsi massacre was in retaliation for a three-pronged Hutu attack on Tutsi strongholds near the Tanzanian border . An estimated 15,000 have already been killed , and nearly 20,000 more Hutus have joined 30,000 refugees who had already fled to the safety of Tanzania , from which they frequently mount raids . TIME Correspondent Lee Griggs visited the area of the fighting last week and sent this report : <P> The Tutsis seem to be creating a no man 's land along the Tanzanian border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's most overcrowded countries , with a population of 325 persons per square mile , I saw almost no one during many miles of driving in the countryside . Every dwelling has been abandoned or burned down . Fields of coffee , cotton and beans stand overgrown . At Nyanza Lac , a once-bustling village of 3,000 people on Burundi 's Lake Tanganyika , the only inhabitants are wild dogs . <P> Bloodstained panga knives and a slashed tribal drum lie in the middle of the dusty main street . A huge stork pecks for grubs in a gutted drygoods store , and weasels scurry in the debris . The main square is littered with broken rumba phonograph records-and an empty , bloodstained black shoe . From a pole at the town water pump flies the red-and-white flag of the Jeunesse Rvolutlonnaire , the paramilitary youth groups who did most of the killing . The youth groups are run by the Tutsis ' Party of Unity and National Progress ( Uprona ) , which in effect rules the country . The job of the Jeunesse is to mop up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their savage campaign against the " rebels . " Survivors have told stories of men , women and children being herded into straw huts and burned alive . Refugees arrived in Tanzania with their hands , ears , even their feet chopped off . This year the Tutsis are being more discreet , killing mainly at night . But a nun assigned to the area to treat leprosy said she has no work because " everyone has fled-or is dead . " Farther down the road a Jeunesse waved his rifle and boasted : " It 's very simple . They want to kill us , so we must kill them first . " <P> Hutu Hunt . At Mabanda , where this year 's fighting started , a band of spear-carrying Tutsi irregulars were clustered in a bar , drinking bottles of beer to get in the mood for the night 's Hutu hunt . " We will kill as many as we have to , " boasted one old man , " as many as it takes to make our families safe here . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
