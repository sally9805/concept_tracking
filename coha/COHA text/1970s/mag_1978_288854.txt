When he signed his first recording contract in the ' 20s , Thomas ( " Fats " ) Waller demanded an unusual rider : there had to be a fresh bottle of gin on his piano when he arrived in the morning and another to take home when he left in the afternoon . But then there was nothing usual about Fats . " He was a man of gargantuan appetites and talent , " says Murray Horwitz , Ai n't Misbehavin 's associate director . " He was 100% . When he was with you , he did n't hold anything back . Everything he had was yours , his heart and whatever else he might talk you into . " <P> Born in Manhattan in 1904 , Fats grew up in Harlem , where his father was a pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church , the establishment that Adam Clayton Powell Jr . later made famous .
