Under Food and Drug Administration rules , drugs sold in the U.S. must be both safe and effective . But vaccines , which are active biological materials and come under the jurisdiction of another Department of Health , Education and Welfare agency , the Division of Biologies Standards , appear to have eluded the effectiveness requirement . According to a report by the General Accounting Office , DBS , over many years , has allowed 32 substances including some flu vaccines to be marketed though they were virtually useless . Some may also be dangerous . <P> Undertaken at the request of Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut , the Accounting Office 's report is a damning document . Its conclusions are based entirely on the DBS 's own records and show that the agency consistently released vaccines that it knew were of dubious quality . Some of them even failed to match the strength claimed by their manufacturers . DBS did not reject a single lot of flu vaccine , although some tested out at less than 1 % of purported potency . Nor did it stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects . One drug , licensed in 1956 for the treatment of upper respiratory infections , carried a warning that it could result in fever and abdominal cramps . <P> Neither the report nor experts in the field accuse DBS-or the substances in question-of damaging public health . Many of the 32 items have never been in wide use because they are designed to control rare diseases . Most doctors have realized all along that flu and cold vaccines , which have been given to tens of millions of people , are of uncertain value . There is no challenge to vaccines used for combatting serious public health problems like polio , German measles ( rubella ) and measles . <P> But the indictment is important nonetheless . As the report makes clear , DBS inaction resulted at least in part from uncertainty over its legal authority to regulate vaccine potency and how much power HEW could delegate to DBS . A HEW directive seems to have resolved these doubts . A more formal cure is proposed in legislation now before Congress . The bill would combine DBS and FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , health officials would not discuss the charges .
