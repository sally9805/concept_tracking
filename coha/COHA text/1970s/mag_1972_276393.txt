TIME 's James Willwerth , who covered the riot , returned to assess conditions today . His report : <P> <P> ON the surface , Attica has changed . A new superintendent , Ernest L. Montanye , a beefy former guard , is trying to make the prison an easier place to do time . The screens in the visiting room are gone , and visitors now include friends and common-law wives . Prison officials still read inmates ' mail , but they have relaxed the censorship of newspapers and magazines . Other improvements include an inmate-administration " liaison " committee , a second shower a week , soft drinks and health foods in the commissary , an orientation course for new prisoners , the hiring of 21 black and Spanish-speaking guards ( total number : 415 ) , one telephone call a month , individual control over the light bulb in a man 's cell , a local all-night radio program on cell earphones , more yard time , new green wash-and-wear uniforms and a well-stocked law library . <P> Yet Attica remains troubled . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationships between the keepers and the kept . " It 's hard doing time here , " says Inmate Robert Johnson , 34 . " It 's the officers ' attitude . Hold it up . Slow it down . Constant bickering . " Some guards still call black inmates " nigger , " and the doctor is accused of mixing arbitrary racial attitudes with his medicine . The food is still bad . At lunch the liver was leathery and the mashed potatoes cold and lumpy . Everyone at the table insisted that conditions are worse now than a year ago . <P> Officers armed with AR-15 rifles and sniper scopes now stand in towers above the exercise yards . Eighteen alleged leaders of the uprising are still held in an isolated cell block under " protective custody .

The gloom is accentuated by the wheezing and clicking of gates and locks . <P> Like most half-century-old prison fortresses , Attica was designed to confine and punish men rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , counseling or education . In an effort to reduce tension , all correctional officers have lately attended ten hours of " conflict reduction " classes at local colleges . But as Superintendent Montanye sadly observes : " I am unable to point out any really new , progressive programs for the prisoners . And the human situation is abnormal . All we can do is bring tensions down to a level where , maybe , men can live decently. "
