 | From fame to obscurity in three short years . In a way , that 's what 's happened to the Kienast family of Liberty Corner , N.J. ? to Peggy Jo , 33 ; and Bill , 41 ; to Meg , almost seven ; and John , four and a half ; and to the five blond , blueeyed adorable imps ( shown above , from left to right ) : Sara , Abigail , Ted , Amy and Gordon ? who turned three on February 24 . Peggy Jo ? a woman whose boundless good sense , humor , warmth and efficiency never cease to amaze me ? is now the sole ringmaster of the seven-ring Kienast circus . Last year at this time , she was filling out 26 separate income-tax forms , because , the year before , all nine Kienasts had been paid to appear on a New York television talk show . This year she has only one income-tax return for herself and Bill to worry about . At lunchtime and when they romped outdoors , the quintuplets used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular schedule to ease the burden of a harassed mother . The loyal brigade has been allowed to fade away ; a mere handful of friends drops in each week . Instead of a full-time housekeeper , there 's a half-day Monday-through-Friday helper ? Cynthia Kitchen , an able young Jamaican woman , who adds to the bedlam by bringing along her own eight-month-old infant to the job . If you patronize the Pluckemin , N.J. , A &; P supermarket , your shopping cart may happen to jostle the two carts the Kienast family pushes ; for when she markets in the afternoon , Peggy Jo must bring along her whole crew . While John races around , Meg pushes three bouncy little ones packed into one cart , and Peggy Jo wedges the groceries around the two in her wagon . Among other shoppers , there 's no ripple  | of excitement , hardly a second glance . Only the store manager notices , and he looks nervous . " He 's afraid they might get loose and wreck his store , " Peggy Jo says . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want her youngsters to be stared at and jostled . She even avoids using the word " quintuplets . " When referring to the five , it 's always " the little kids " or " the little guys . " The loss of her daily helpers is Peggy Jo 's own choice . " We just outgrew them , " she explains . " We do n't require one-to-one coverage any more . " Nor does she feel the need of a full-time housekeeper , despite five loads of wash daily , five bedrooms turned topsy-turvy , five inquisitive preschoolers inventing fresh mischief . " It would be a nuisance to have someone sleep in , " she says . Now Peggy Jo single-handedly shoulders all the chores familiar to suburban mothers . There 's the early-morning rush to get Meg , a first-grader , up , dressed , fed , and into the school bus , lunchbox in hand , by 8:25 A.M. There 's the endless car-pooling : pick up John at nursery school at 11 : 30 A.M. ; pile everyone in the car to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choir group on Tuesdays and her piano lessons on Thursdays . There 's dinner to be cooked and served in two sittings ? children at six , grownups at eight . There are seven pairs of new shoes to be bought every three months ; medical checkups ; dental visits . ( All seven Kienast children were born after their mother was treated with fertility drugs because of her failure to ovulate . With each pregnancy , there was the risk of a multiple birth . Meg and John arrived ? and then the quints came along . ) A year has passed since Good Housekeeping last visited the Kienast family , a year in which five toddlers have grown into five small children . Now there is no limit to the mayhem the five are capable of wreaking . Unusually agile , they can unlatch any gate , teeter on a chair to reach any shelf , tug at a bureau drawer to empty its contents . All five can open the door of the refrigerator and , what 's worse , turn on the electric stove , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can take off their clothes , and frequently do , hiding shoes , dropping laces out an upstairs window . Investigating the master bathroom , they raise a storm of swirling bath powder , shinny up the sink to enjoy a small flood of splashing water . Even the simplest activity of daily living becomes a chore when it 's multiplied by five . Item : taking Meg to her piano lesson . Five warm jackets must be zipped , five heads counted as they climb in the car , and five squirmy little bodies strapped into seat belts . Then there are the yammers ? " I do n't wan na sit with Gordon . Wan na sit with you , Mommy . " Within minutes Abigail unlatches her belt , and the station wagon must be pulled to the side of the road until it is refastened . Item : unpacking the supermarket purchases . Each three-year-old wants to help Mommy . Later , four rolls of toilet N-per must be rescued from the playroom , t- , , 7o ca=i , of soup retrieved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two days late ? , 1 ilos bruised by the marks of tiny teeth . Lunchtime is a comparatively subdued occasion , yet these are the notes I jotted down on a recent visit : Peggy Jo in kitchen pouring vegetable soup into mugs , cutting grilled ham-andcheese sandwiches into quarters . Helper Cynthia attempting to tie on bibs . Abigail grabs Ted 's bib , and runs . All scuffle about who sits where at the child-size refectory table . " Get away , all , " calls Peggy Jo as she carries in the food . " S-o-o-p , " trills Amy , and spoons a mouthful neatly . Sara : " I want some milk . " John : " We want strawberry milk . " Sara : " I want chocolate milk . " Gordon : " Want more soup . " ( He has just spilled his . ) Peggy Jo pours strawberry-flavored milk into plastic glasses . " I want the first one , " John says . Amy : " I want a baby glass . " Her legs drum against the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school ) discover that the melted Swiss cheese can be pulled out , using fingers , into long sticky strands . " I got bubble gum , " Abigail crows , mouth and hands sticky with cheese . " Eat up , kids . Pay  | attention , " says Peggy Jo . And , in an aside to me , " They really do better if no one 's here . Besides , I ca n't stand to watch . " Ted holds his empty glass upside down between his teeth , then dips the rim into his soup , and licks vigorously . Gordon laughs . Abigail tries to balance a glass on her ear . Amy , holding up her empty mug , calls out , " Mommy , look at Amy . " The smallest , she is the biggest eater . Peggy Jo : " You 're doing just fine , Amy . " Amy , hopefully : " Chocolate cake ? " Peggy Jo : " You know we do n't have dessert at lunch . " Abigail gets up . Peggy Jo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Abigail did n't finish her soup . She did n't even taste it . " Sara wanders from chair to chair , sipping from all the milk glasses . Then she pours milk back and forth from one glace to another . Gordon dips his sandwich into his soup . Amy licks her spoon and rises . " I 'm dry , Mommy . I 'm not soaking wet , " she says . " You 'd better not be , " Peggy Jo answers in mock sternness . She starts to remove bibs and wipe off small hands and faces . Sara helps her sponge off the table . " Off the stairs , kids , " Peggy Jo roars to no one in particular . This is an admonition repeated at top-sergeant volume dozens of times daily , along with , " Get down from there " and " Out of the den . " In theory , the den is off limits to small children , they having usurped the rest of the house . Despite the endless motion ? like a home movie run at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress during their year as the Terrible Twos , They have developed remarkable muscle coordination : they eat neatly ( when they 're so minded ) , pedal tricycles expertly , help dress themselves ? Gordon can even fasten a button and wriggle into pajamas with feet . They have graduated from cribs to beds , mostly out of dire necessity : the three little girls started to climb from the top bars of their cribs onto the bureau , and to rock until the bureau swayed dangerously . They chatter constantly , although to a stranger 's ear , the din sometimes sounds like five Donald Ducks in full voice . Sara speaks most clearly , wielding long words and complex sentences with ease ? " She has a bigger vocabulary than mine , " their father says . It has been the first year of Discipline with a capital D , and Peggy Jo is cautiously pleased with the results . " I think the age of reason has sort of set in , " she says . " Now when I say , ' Do n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Of course , there 's also a good chance they will . " With physical barriers no longer workable ? the children are just too nimble ? Peggy Jo must rely on verbal admonition to keep her five under some modicum of control . " The rules are more for safety than anything else , " she explains ? to keep them from falling into the recently built swimming pool , from dashing down the driveway into the road , from tumbling down the stairs , from burning themselves on the stove . Peggy Jo shudders at the chance that one child may break loose in a crowded shopping-center parking lot . " They have to learn to obey a simple order , " she explains . " Coming when they 're called ? that is very high on the list . " When Peggy Jo barks like a drill sergeant , she means business , and the five know it . A child who does n't obey gets a spanking ? two or three openhanded slaps on the rear end ? and , if he persists , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief , it works ? at least some of the time . Peggy Jo is convinced that strictness pays off . " If you go through the grief of yelling , spanking , sending them to their rooms , it may be harder now , but ultimately it will be easier for everyone . " Yet she also respects a child 's defiance . She almost likes it when she hears that inevitable chorus of three-year-old " noes . " " To me , " Peggy Jo says , " saying ' no ' shows spunk , standing up to you as if they were ten feet tall . " Toilet training has been one major accomplishment of the past year . All five now remain dry during the day ? most of the time ? and Abigail is even out of rubber pants at night . A year ago Peggy Jo vowed , " That 's a chore I do n't plan to become involved in at all . I 'm convinced that when they 're ready , they 'll train themselves . " But during the summer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapers . " Tentatively she introduced them to the potty . " They 'd have no part of it . " She forgot about it for a few weeks , and tried again . Still no response . " Then decided to work on two at a time . I chase Abigail and Gordon , who seem to pick up new things most quickly . I. must have been the right time , because within a week everyone was trained . " She ca n't quite explain how she did it . but persistence was a major element " For a time I just seemed to be living in the bathroom . By the time I finished with the last one , the first was ready to try again . " Now she keeps alert to suspicious fidgeting , but frequently the five toiley themselves . To help gain control at night , she feeds them no liquids after 4:30 P.M. I asked if she also awakened them to go to the bathroom . " Oh , horrors ! " she responded . " Are you kidding ? My motto is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , now scattered in four bedrooms , there 's inevitably one who calls at night for a drink of water or for comforting after a bad dream . " If I do n't hear from any of them , I find myself waking and listening anyway , " Peggy Jo says . " Often I 'll lie there and think of all the awful things that might have happened that day . " Happily , practically nothing awful has happened this entire year . Although heads are bumped and knees bloodied daily , only Ted has suffered real injury ? he slammed against an iron bar at a nearby playground a few months ago , and required two stitches in his forehead . Alone with six chiidren - including John ? all crying lustily ? Peggy Jo had to drive to Cynthia 's home and bring her back to Liberty Corner to watch the others before Peggy Jo could dash with Ted to the hospital emergency room . The five are perfect physically ? the pediatrician has n't made a house call in a year ? with the exception of Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes started to cross , and the ophthalmologist diagnosed extreme farsightedness , but he expects it to correct itself by the time she is  | seven . Abigail still charges around at breakneck speed despite the glasses , but in eight months she has twisted two pairs beyond repair . Keeping the lenses clean is another chore to add to a mother 's list ? " I grab her and wash them every time she walks past , " Peggy Jo says . The other four seldom tease Abigail about her glasses ? in fact , a pleasant camaraderie seems to have developed during their third year . No subgroups have formed to gang up on the others ? there is n't any victim among the five . Although they bicker , grab toys from each other , occasionally hit and even bite , sibling rivalry appears to be minimal . Often the five play alone , side by side , but sometimes they 'll file past Peggy Jo in line , like little soldiers on parade , or stuff themselves ? laughing uproariously ? into the small pantry cabinet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth . Recently , at breakfast , Sara said , " You want to play a game ? " " Yes , yes , " chorused Gordon and Ted . " They all played something , " Peggy Jo says . " Darned if I know what it was . " Learning to share and to take turns is an early reality for these five . When two are wailing , whom does a mother comfort first ? Without conscious effort , Peggy Jo manages to achieve a rough evenhandedness . Still flushed with sleep , Gordon , in T-shirt and underpants , wanders down from his afternoon nap , and climbs into his mother 's lap to be cuddled . Then Sara trails in , complaining dolefully , " Mommy , Meg woked me up , " and nestles beside him . Before long , all five ? like a litter of puppies ? are curled up in her arms . " A few minutes of cuddling ? that 's what makes the difference , " Peggy Jo says . " If you really care , I think kids know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lots of them and only one of me . " Peggy Jo 's parents , French and Sis Ratcliffe , frequently take their grandchildren , usually two at a time , for a sleep-over visit to their home in nearby Westfield . A few weeks ago , when the others spotted Abigail with her coat on , ready to leave with her grandmother , there was a wail of complaint ? " Let me go ? I want to go to Granny 's house . " " It is n't your turn , " Mrs. Ratcliffe explained . " It 's Abigail 's turn . " The whining stopped promptly . Apparently they all understood . Yet each of the five has a sturdy sense of his own individuality . Let a visitor trip over the names , and she will be swiftly corrected ? " I 'm Amy . That 's Sara . " And if she mixes up shoes or socks , they will be snatched away fiercely ? " That 's mine . " Each three-year-old is already uniquely himself : Gordon , the biggest , demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy does n't let anyone push her around ; venturous Abigail leads the mischief ; Ted , stubborn , is a little pack rat , who wo n't let loose the toy cars he clutches in both fists even to be helped into his jacket . You ca n't be in the Kienast house for five minutes without knowing that five sunny children are having a ball . Even at the day 's end , when everyone else is tired , a joyous greeting committee shrieks , " Hi , Daddy , " and swarms all over Bill Kienast before he has time to remove his coat . ( Bill 's plastics manufacturing company , to the couple 's delight , is thriving . ) Do the quints lose out because of their fiveness ? Hardly . One family friend , herself the mother of three , says , " They 're the brightest , healthiest , most outgoing , and attractive children I 've ever known . " Spreading herself thin with her five three-year-olds , Peggy Jo must also answer the needs of John , only a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost-seven . Last spring , leaving Bill and Grandma Ratcliffe in charge , Peggy Jo took a brief trip to Florida with the older two ? " it did the three of us a world of good , " she says . " We could do grown-up things together ? there 's no time for them around here . " Yet John and Meg suffer from the depredations of the five . John 's picture puzzles must be hidden on a top bookcase shelf in order to remain intact , and played with only when the little ones are napping . Without complaint , Meg has shared her bedroom with Abigail ( who turned on the faucets of the connecting bathroom full stream at midnight ) , with Amy ( who dumped out the contents of Meg 's bureau drawers ) , and now with Sara , who has n't done anything outrageous ? yet . She likes to have friends in to play after school , and ca n't always understand why her mother has n't the time to fetch them . " I 'm not running a chauffeur service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh challenge of not having daily volunteers to help her , Peggy Jo today seems more vital than ever ? gayer , funnier , more relaxed . For three years now I 've been trying to fathom how she does it . These are some elements I 've noted : She has a genuine zest for motherhood , a deep joy in the growth of her seven . She has energy to spare , perhaps because she paces herself , and compromises without guilt about nonessentials . " The secret , " she says , " is trying to make things easy on yourself . " This means withdrawing for a quiet cup of coffee before becoming short-order breakfast cook for the five ; slipping out a couple of hours each week to whack away frustration in a fiercely fought game of paddle tennis ; planning frequent vacations ? she and Bill go somewhere briefly ( if a babyguardian is available ) about every three months . It means dispensing with lesser amenities ? the neat home , the children 's daily bath . It does not mean , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers important . It 's troublesome to get seven children neatly dressed for church at 9:30 A.M. of a Sunday morning , but " religion is important to me , and I think it 's a family thing . " It 's a bother to pile the five into the car to go fetch John at nursery school , but " they have to get out sometimes . " Making candy apples at Halloween is n't required , but it 's fun for the children . When life seems at its sourest , Peggy Jo can let off steam by making a joke of it ? usually at her own expense . " Do you have any problem with temper tantrums ? " I asked recently . " Just mine and Bill 's , " she replied . " Is there a particular bad time of day ? " " Sure the entire day . " " What 's worse than a two-year-old ? " Peggy Jo and Bill used to ask , any answer in chorus , " Five two-year-olds . " Now Peggy Jo says , " Three is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm waiting But I do n't expect any miracles . "
