Just Like Whisky <P> Oh Rapid Roy that stock car boy <P> He too much to believe <P> You know he always got an extra <P> pack of cigarettes Rolled up in his T-shirt sleeve <P> He got a tattoo on his arm that <P> say " Baby " <P> He got another one that just say <P> " Hey " <P> But every Sunday afternoon he <P> is a dirt track demon <P> In a ' 57 Chevrolet <P> Carl Smart works in a furniture factory and " Stick " Elliott sells junk , but if their callings are prosaic , the men are not . They are fast rollers in the grand Southern tradition of dirt track racing : small-town versions of Rapid Roy . Up to 3,500 fans will converge on the Concord Speedway 15 miles northeast of Charlotte , N.C. , on a balmy Saturday evening to watch these two " pedal-to-the-metal " drivers bump fenders as they scream around the track in their blazing fast , gloriously battered stock cars . Stick and Carl are masters of the " power slide , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velocity of his car against its distance from other vehicles while skidding laterally around a slick clay oval at 100 m.p.h. - up to four hurtling Chevys all fishtailing in unison . For excitement , the power slide is a grand slam homer and game-winning touchdown wrapped into one . It is this kind of action and these kind of men that draw perhaps 500,000 Southerners on a weekend to some 100 small tracks operating week after week for nine months a year . The sport defies economic logic . A late-model sports car race might feature a dozen cars worth from $12,000 to $16,000 each flying flat out to win a first prize of $700 . At the smallest tracks , the purse can drop as low as $75 . <P> Says Blaine S. Grant , the 45-year-old owner of Sure Deal Motors in Bessemer City : " Racing 's like whisky . Someone will spin me out against a wall and I 'll get disgusted and quit . By next Tuesday I 'll be looking to fix the car so we can race again Saturday . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tapeworm roads that swing through the Piedmont hills seem designed for it , and until this decade they were used for exactly that by moonshiners . Almost every male over 14 shyly admits to a little informal dark-of-night racing experience . California teen-agers get high on laughing gas ; their peers in North Carolina prefer the 150 h.p. bursts of acceleration that a bottle of nitrous oxide delivers when attached to a sedan 's air filter . <P> This thunder road legacy manifests itself after work on Friday when cars begin moving through the dusk toward Concord . Built in 1945 , the half-mile dirt track has few amenities . Lighting is dim , spectators sit on concrete ledges . Yet Concord is a shrine . Junior Johnson , Tiny Lund and the illustrious Petty clan ( Richard Petty , king of the stockers , won $378,865 last year ) began their racing careers here . Spectators expect the local boy they applaud to become tomorrow 's NASCAR hero . Says Cabarrus County Sheriffs Deputy Stowe Cobb : " We 're all participants because those boys out there are our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
