IT was one of the year 's stranger diplomatic episodes . Leaving the latest dollar crisis to subordinates for a while , U.S. Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz last week flew off on an urgent three-day trip to Moscow . He got Kissinger-like treatment : a minimum of protocol , a box at the Bolshoi for Giselle , and a three-hour meeting with Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev . Shultz came to talk trade in general , but he also had an unusual mission : to lobby for the Kremlin 's help in a tough struggle that the White House faces with a testy U.S. Congress . <P> This concerns the trade agreement on which Nixon and Brezhnev shook hands in Moscow last May . That agreement promised a vast expansion of the two nations ' meager level of trade ( $200 million in 1971 ) through tariff reductions and long-term credits . What the Russians regard as the key element of the deal-treatment of Russian imports on a " most-favored-nation " basis* - requires congressional approval . <P> Much to the Administration 's dismay , Congress seems determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce some time in the next few weeks a major test of wills between Legislative and Executive Branches . The battle could cause some dangerous zigzags in the entire East-West detnte . <P> U.S. negotiators warned the Soviets last May that the preferred tariff treatment they sought would need approval by a finicky Congress . But in August , Moscow began levying its now celebrated " education tax " on would-be emigrants . It is a tough measure ; a younger Russian who has benefited from training at a state university might be required to pay an exit fee of as much as $30,000 . The tax is not discriminatory per se , because-the fact is often overlooked-it applies to all Russians . But it falls heavily on Jews , a large percentage of whom are university-trained . <P> Jewish organizations in the U.S. immediately mounted a massive protest against the Kremlin effort to " ransom " Soviet Jewry , and Capitol Hill responded . Washington Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson announced that he would use most-favored-nation treatment as a legislative weapon against the Soviet exit tax , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ranges from conservative old cold warriors to liberals who apparently are trying to cater to a supposed " Jewish vote . " <P> Struggle . For a while , to the Administration 's relief , Soviet officials suggested that the tax might soon be simply forgotten . Then , in late January , the Soviets for some reason formally promulgated the tax , and the congressional struggle resumed . <P> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills , a leader of the exit-tax foes , bluntly told visiting Soviet Deputy Foreign Trade Minister V.S. Alkhimov in Washington last week that Moscow would not get M.F.N. until the exit tax was dropped . In the Senate , Jackson now has lined up 73 co-sponsors for his amendment . It was not just a Jewish issue , he said in a Senate speech , but " an American issue in this nation of immigrants . I would not be in this chamber today , " he continued , " if Norway , the country of my parents ' birth , had practiced the sort of emigration policy that the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
