txt Letters pg . 42 Letters What 's in a Number ? Koch and His Aides : The Kept Promise To the Editor : Concerning your editorial of Dec. 1 " Doing His Number " : Numbers as names could have a brighter future than your editorial suggests . Using the mathematical descriptions of the number-name , much more can be learned about a person than a name alone . Consider the following : A radical leader could be given an irrational number while a person who likes Lawrence Welk-type enusic would be a perfect square . A bore becomes a repeating decimal ; an undertaker is a terminal decimal . But one who is immortal we give a nonrepeating , nonterrninal  --  decimal . Let the military be integers but let those engaged in the arts be imaginary numbers . Congressmen would retain their present designations , like NY-42-R . Roman numerals would be reserved for religious leaders ( the Rev. XVII ) . Economists become numbers like .2 of one percent ; stockbrokers can be named " Up 31/4 . " If you have an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have numbers like 41/4 . Stuffy historians would be square roots but sports figures would be prime numbers . Let certain numbers be reserved for the following : bookies  --  ratios like 3:5 ; used-car salesmen ? $4,500 reduced to $3,850 ; real estate people-4 acres with a 500-foot front ; tennis pros-40-love . Let surveyors be trig functions ; pastry chefs multiples of pi ; crusaders become exponents of causes , and TV vice presidents in charge of programming become convergent series . The two political phrties would be the Variables and the Constants . Upon death , they give you a negative number and cancel you out . To the Editor : " Justice is blind , " said Mr. Dooley , " also deaf , dumb and has a wooden leg . " In South Africa , a black man is found dead in his prison cell , allegedly beaten by the police . Several months later an inquest is held , and the police are exonerated . The Times calls the proceedings a whitewash , and in Washington , the Stale Department denounces the South African Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New York , a prominent judge is convicted of lying to a grand jury , a crime which merits a 10-year jai ' . sentence . The friendly and obliging trial judge rules that the scales of justice would be in balance if his prevaricating colleague were put on probation . Daily , we read of defenseless old people being beaten by young thugs , then robbed , raped and sometimes murdered in the streets or at home . If they are apprehended , easy-going courts and wily criminal lawyers often cooperate in plea bargaining for light sentences or maybe none at all . In Brooklyn , an innocent black youth is gunned to death by a white policeman . A year later a jury of his peers decides that the policeman is innocent of crime by reason of insanity . No doubt this ' verdict will miraculously restore the officer 's reason . So how do we differentiate between justice in America and that dispensed in the Republic of South Africa ? Kipling wrote a piece about the Colonel 's Lady and Judy O'Grady . He reached a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you get to Alan Orlin , As for editors of papers like Vol . CXXVII , No. 43,779 , they could have names like " 4 inches by 3 columns " or simply " that 's 30 . " God would be a division by 0  --  the undefined reaching toward infinity . The list goes on .. .. THOMAS ( b2-4ac ) KNIESER DERICK ( met ) TAYLOR Newburgh , N.Y. , Dec. 4 , 1977 The writers are math and science teachers at Valley Central High School , Montgomery , N.Y . To the Editor : In your editorial " Doing His Number " you exhibit due concern for the possibility of numbers being employed instead of names . Why then , in the name of Numero Uno , do you permit me to suffer the gross indignity of being addressed solely by street number on the heading of my monthly bill for delivery of the New York Number 2 ? 865 ( MARTIN L. HALKIN ) Valley Stream , L.I. , Dec. 3 , 1977 the facts in the case , they 're like a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are twins , in the matter of sins . HERBERT B. LARNER Montclair , N.J. , Dec. 4 , 1911 If a Crown Is Returned To the Editor : The Crown of St. Stephen has long been in safekeeping in the United , States . There is no question of its being the property of any other nation than Hungary ; but Hungary is an occupied country unable to decide its own destiny . Doubtless this historic treasure symbolic of an independent Christian state that held the frontiers of the West , will be as safe in Budapest as in Fort Knox ; but what of the implications of its surrender to a government imposed by Soviet bayonets and responsible for the judicial murder of the Prime Minister , Imre Nagy , and the Defense Minister , Paul Muletter ? There will be many to interpret the return of the crown as further recognition in the West of the legitimacy of the Soyiet empire in Eastern Europe . New demands must be expected , tor example , a claim from Prague to the Czechoslovak gold also held in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many minds with the cause of human rights , to require reconsideration of so fateful a decision . JOHN Bloos-DAvisorsi Member of Parliament London , Nov. 28 , 1977 To the Editor : The focus of attention and consequent debate on the new organization of the executive office of the mayor has partially obscured some of the fundamental lessons the prior history of the office has taught us . The City Charter changes of the early 1960 's created the office of deputy mayor/city administrator at the behest of the good-government groups of the time . This introduction of the beginnings of a city manager system failed because strong elected mayors would not countenance such a role for a subordinate . The fact is that some prior mayors gave extraordinary authority to mayoral staff members who were not characterized as deputy mayors but who acted as such . We should not forget mayoral " advisers " situated in party positions who were , in fact , shadow mayors and wielded immense power and authority . All attempts at structuring a mayoral office to relate to the needs of administering the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elected mayor and his style of governing . Mayor-elect Koch has said repeatedly that he does not intend to delegate his charter of office to anyone in or out of government . By eliminating a first deputy mayor title , he has in fact already attracted extraordinarily talented individuals to the other deputy mayor posts he has announced , as well as implementing a significant commitment . Conceptually , Ed Koch is putting into effect one of his most important campaign promises , which is to keep his " in " mailbox open and not delegate the key decision-'making to others , hidden from public view , whether they be deputy mayors , budget directors or anyone else inside or outside his administration . This perspective of mayoral administration certainly deserves a chance to be tried . It will , of course , call for an extraordinarily active and working mayor-administrator . Ed Koch certainly seems up to the task . It is to be expected that the one casualty of this reorganization , Ed - estikyan , will be brought into the incoming administration in another important capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDWARD A. MORRISON New York , Dec. 7 , 1977 The writer served as a special assistant to Mayor John Lindsay . When Judges Explain To the Editor : In " Deathly Prose " ( Topics Nov. 25 ) you chastise judges who , in holding the death penalty not unconstitutional , express their personal abhorrence of such punishment . Do we not expect judges  --  especially those who exercise ultimate authority  --  to explain their decisions rather than just say " constitutional , " " unconstitutional , " " affirmed , " " reversed , " " modified " ? I suggest that particularly in emotionally charged issues on which the public is sharply divided ( at times with irrational as well as rational political action ) a conscientious judge is entitled  --  indeed owes the public a duty  --  to explain , if that be the case , that the basis of his or her vote is legal judgment in accordance with his or her oath of office , despite personal abhorrence . Incidentally , that has timely application to the abortion issue . COPAL MINTZ New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the U.S. Higher Education : What Scholastic Aptitude Tests Do Well To the Editor : It 's proper to be concerned about such tests as the S.A.T . But Dr. Slack 's recent Op-Ed piece suggesting that Scholastic Aptitude Test scores are not needed misses the point . The S.A.T . is not a substitute for grades and other information but an independent measure that provides additional useful information . Contrary to Dr. Slack 's conjectures , the S.A.T . is not biased . It measures abilities needed to pursue a course of study at most colleges and universities . To be useful , the test must reflect the culture of our schools and society . Within that context it is culture-fair . Its questions are all reviewed and rereviewed ? by minority and majority reviewers ? and edited and pretested before they are used in a test . Students who have suffered from social and educational neglect , from the effects of prejudice and discrimination , are unlikely to do well on the S.A.T . But for these students , as for the more advantaged , the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not a matter to be settled by debate but by evidence , and the data are clear and consistent . The S.A.T . measures aptitude for college work . It is not designed to measure or define " intelligence " ( whatever that may be ) , and it does n't . It measures verbal and mathematical reasoning ability , The test presents tasks with words and numbers like those encountered in college . When college-level work stops requiring these abilities , the S.A.T . ? if it is needed  --  will have to measure something else . But right now the S.A.T . predicts how well a student . is likely to do in college , and especially in the first year . It does that very well . grades to test scores , school records and other information attest to this . In fact , this three-hour test predicts academic success in college almost as well as four years of school grades ( and the two combined predict better than either alone ) . For , in addition to motivation , creativity , stamina and a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numbers is still essential to higher education and work in many careers . Finally , Dr. Slack asks what would happen if nobody came to the S.A.T . ' s . In that case , each college could set its The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . own entrance exams ( shades of 1901 ! ) or could rely more on grades and letters of recommendation . But this proffered solution is not as simple as it seems . Grades are at least as subject to bias and " error of measurement " as test scores . Grade inflation is still a problem in some schools and tests like the S.A.T . provide an independent yardstick . For some of the same reasons grades have lost some of their validity and letters of recommendation ; have lost theirs . A test like the S.A.T . insures that students from varied backgrounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when applying to the same college . S.A.T . test scores continue to add useful information to the college admissions process . When they no longer do , we will be the first to seek the reasons why .
