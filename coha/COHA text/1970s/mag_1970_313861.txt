At Geneva 's new air terminal , the scene is a recurrent attraction : a bald and stubby executive clad in a redlined cape and a Pierre Cardin jacket buttoned to the chin clambers from a custom-built black Lincoln Continental . With him comes an eyebrow-raising entourage : one male aide and four mini-skirted lasses of Playboy pulchritude . The normally expressionless Swiss faces at the ticket counter light up with half-amused , half-respectful recognition . " It 's Bernie , " whispers a Swissair hostess to a new colleague . Taking at least two of his curvaceous companions with him , Bernie quickly boards his private Mystre jet . His destination : a London ( or sometimes Paris ) business appointment for which he is , characteristically , two hours late . <P> A ONETIME poor boy from Brooklyn , 5-ft. 5-in . Bernard Cornfeld causes quite a stir in almost everything he does . Despite the persistent antagonism of conservative European moneymen , some foreign governments and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , he has built his Investors Overseas Services into one of the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily by selling mutual funds outside the U.S. , and Cornfeld has proved himself to be a master salesman . Today he manages some $2.2 billion of other people 's money , and his personal fortune amounts to about $140 million . Still a bachelor at 42 , Cornfeld is a bizarre figure , part Peter Pan and part Midas . His days and nights are packed with people , planes , horses , telephone calls , travel and parties . Everywhere he goes , even to address staid bankers , some of his girls accompany him . Cornfeld is ordinarily as mild-mannered and soft-spoken as a shoe clerk , but he can break abruptly into profane rages . His informality prompts all of his employees to call him Bernie . But Cornfeld 's financial trailblazing has altered the investment climate of Europe and helped hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens ( and perhaps a few crooks as well ) to acquire a larger stake in the capitalist economies of the free world . <P> High-Voltage Sales . Cornfeld started I.O.S. 14 years ago as a one-man firm in a Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest financial sales organization , with 16,000 salesmen and 800,000 clients in 110 countries . Despite the natural resistance created by falling stock and mutual-fund prices , the high-voltage organization last year almost doubled its sales , to $3.1 billion . Just under $1 billion in cash flowed into the company 's coffers . I.O.S. not only manages eleven mutual funds of its own but has spread into almost every major field of finance . It owns or controls six insurance companies , a dozen banks and finance firms scattered from Italy to the Netherlands Antilles , real estate subsidiaries selling condominium apartments in Spain and Florida , even a small computer outfit and a financial publishing company .
