txt Signs of a Cuban-U.S. thaw keep coming . ? U.S. passports will again be valid for travel to Cuba as Washington on March 18 lifts its 16-year-old restriction on travel by U.S. citizens to the Caribbean island . ? It is likely to be " play ball " in Havana for a U.S. all-star team in line with a plan by Bowie Kuhn , baseball commissioner , to send such a team before the start of the 1977 U.S. season . ? Talks on a broad range of issues , starting with a new fishing boundary and a renewal of an about-to-expire antihijack agreement , have been given the go-ahead by Washington . But there can be no mistaking a slight uneasiness in Washington over moving too quickly on the thaw . President Carter worries out loud about Cuban President Fidel Castro 's hemispheric and global intentions . In his radio call-in show March 5 , Mr. Carter referred to Cuba 's " military involvement " in Africa and to Cuba 's interference in the internal affairs of countries in the Western Hemisphere as stumbling blocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which also have been sprinkled through Mr. Carter 's public appearances in the past three weeks , rankle Dr. Castro , according to recent interviews . But the Cuban leader makes clear that he , too , wants some sort of thaw . In a recent television interview , Dr. Castro , an avid baseball fan and player himself , suggested that the New York Yankees visit Cuba for a three-game series starting April 1 . The Yankees liked the idea , according to Gabe Paul , the team 's president . But Mr. Kuhn // From pa  --  e 1 Baseball diplomacy ' for U.S. , Cuba wondered if it might not be better to send an all-star team , representing all the teams in both the American and National leagues . Secretary of State Cyrus Vance has given an informal go-ahead to the plan ? with either the Yankees themselves or an all-star team . Because of the imminent removal of travel restrictions for U.S. citizens going to Cuba , the players , managers , and others connected with whichever team goes would not require Department of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to the ' Ping-Pong diplomacy " of 1970 that preceded the opening of limited diplomatic relations between the United States and China . Whether the analogy is valid or not , the projected match is a clear indication of changing attitudes in the U.S. toward its island neighbor . An earlier effort to work out such a baseball competition was vetoed in 1975 by then Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger . Full relations are a long way off . There are conditions attached to the restoration of such ties ? removal of Cuban troops in Angola , the termination of all interference in domestic affairs of Latin American countries , and other issues brought up by Mr. Carter . But the Carter administration has no conditions for gathering around a conference table and talking with the Cubans . Mr. Carter put it plainly last weekend : do intend to see discussions initiated with Cuba quite early on reestablishing the antihijacking agreement , arriving at a fishing agreement between us and Cuba since our 200-mile limits do overlap between Florida and Cuba . " Other issues as well ? claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of consular ties ? could be discussed and worked out before the re-establishment of formal diplomatic relations . None of these would necessarily require Cuban action on U.S.-imposed conditions .
