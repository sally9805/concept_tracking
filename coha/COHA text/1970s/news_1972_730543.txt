txt A congressional study indicated today that some government job training programs may waste time and tax money because they do n't boost income enough to help trainees escape poverty . The study , ' released by the Joint Economic Committee , said the $6.8 billion the government has poured into manpower programs during the last decade to try to get the disadvantaged off welfare rolls and onto payrolls has not worked and likely will not . Plans Are n't Substitutes An estimated 6.1 million persons have been trained in the programs . " One major conclusion can be drawn , " wrote Rep. Martha Griffiths ID. , Mich. in a letter of transmittal . " Manpower programs are not a substitute for income supplement programs . Training does increase the earnings of the poor and reduce the poverty ' gap , but continued income supplementation is likely to be necessary for the average trainee . " She suggested that much of the $1.6 billion budgeted for manpower programs . in the current fiscal year " could be better spent on job creation ; " since they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , in a strong economy . with a tight labor market , training programs could be very useful in dealing with residual unemployment , " she said . " But when many skilled workers are already out of a job , training programs serve merely to improve the credentials of the unemployed . " 2 Programs Succeed The study was done for a subcommittee on fiscal policy by staff aide John H. Goldstein . It showed that only two manpower programs  --  those under the original Manpower Development and Training Act MDTA and the out-of-school programs of the Neighborhood Youth Corps  --  have helped poor persons find new or better jobs and become more self-sustaining . But one study of a group of recent MDTA graduates showed their average earnings came only to $3,100 a year ? still $800 below the official poverty level .
