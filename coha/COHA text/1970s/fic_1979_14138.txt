An actor in the costume of P. T. BARNUM struts and frets and twirls a cane beside the ticket booth . As the audience buys its tickets , BARNUM 'S voice is amplified throughout the lobby . His spiel continues  --  improvised , syncopated , outrageously hokey  --  until every person has entered the house . The actor who speaks BARNUM 'S part can address individual members of the audience by , for instance , what they wear  --  " Mr. Red Shirt , Miss Brown Bag "  --  but he must never be abrasive or accosting . Good-humoured lubricity is the tone to take . Here are some of the things MR . BARNUM might say : P. T. BARNUM Ladies and gentlemen , gentlemen and ladies , welcome to P. T. Barnum 's American Museum ! Please have your money ready . We have a fascinating bit of exotica here for you tonight . The lady you 've all heard so much about is with us at last ! That 's right , folks , it 's Elephant Woman ! Queen of the Curiosities ! Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decade , just returned from a triumphant tour of Western Europe ! Ladies and gentlemen ! Elephant Woman walks , she talks , she even laughs like a human being , but due to a dreadful accident of birth she appears to be part pachyderm . That 's what I said , Madam , the lady looks just like an elephant . She 's got an arm the size of an oak tree ! A nose like an elephant 's trunk ! And other features too horrible to mention ! Come on in sir , do n't hesitate . Line forms to the right . You know P. T. Barnum wants to please the people.Folks , I 've combed the world to bring back attractions the American people want to see ! Remember , Mme. Clofullia , the Bearded Lady from Belgium ? I know you do , Ma'am . The in-credible Chang and Eng  --  the Siamese siblings who could n't bear to be separated ? You were here on their opening night , Sir . I remember your face . How about the famouse Mermaid from Feegee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more have made their debuts right here in P. T. Barnum 's American Museum.But I tell you , ladies and gentlemen , there 's never been anything here like the young lady you 're about to see tonight . Those of you with conditions of the heart  --  I 'd advise you to have your glycerin tablets ready . Ladies , if you 're subject to fainting fits , reach for your smelling salts now . We have a physician in attendance , but he ca n't be everywhere at once.That 's right , friends , move right along . Have your money ready . P. T. Barnum guarantees you 'll never have an experience like this one again . Believe me folks , it 's the best bargain in the solar system ! Etc. , etc. , etc. p. 3 The Apron As the seats begin to fill and until the house lights go down , the following scene is played on the stage apron over the sounds of an arriving audience . The scene must be repeated continuously ( with , perhaps , certain attitudinal changes ) until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through : At a tea table , STAGE LEFT , HENRY JEMES , DR . SLOPER , KATHERINE LORING , and JANE ELIZABETH MERRITT ( the MOTHER ) are serving each other in an abstracted and ritualistic way . BARNUM comes from the lobby to join them . The table must be very small , so that the characters are at some pains to avoid touching each other . The scene should induce in those members of the audience who actually listened to BARNUM 'S spiel and therefore expected something salacious , a sharp feeling of disappointment . If it puts them in an unreceptive mood  --  so much the better . The actors will only have to work harder at seduction . As each character speaks , she/he turns from the tea ceremony and addresses the audience . P. T. BARNUM ( Elegiac . ) In the middle of the hottest summer I can remember , the summer of 1864 , the summer I began my American Museum , a female child was born to Jane Elizabeth Merritt of the city of New York . That child made almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Clinical and breezy . ) The child was born a monster and that 's the simple truth of it . Clinically , she suffered from an extreme form of a disorder diagnosed by me twenty-four years after her birth . The name of the disorder is multiple neurofibromatosis . The name of the child was Jane Merritt . It was not until Mr. Barnum discovered her , that she became known asum ( Distastefully. ) the Elephant Woman . p. 4 THE MOTHER ( A sense of wonder and protest . ) Joan , I named her Joan , after someone . At birth , her skin was only a little roughened , only a little thick . When she smiled at me she was like any happy child . Her mouth moved a little strangely , that was all . ( Slowly . ) She was slow to walk . Very slow . ( Quickly . ) But there was no reason to imagine what she would become HENRY JAMES I saw what she became . I saw it only once . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the story out of a good man 's mouth ? At any rate , one autumn afternoon in 1889 , while temporarily eluding the febrile demands of my sister Alice , I walked into Mr. Barnum 's American Museum . And there she was , the Elephant Woman . Surrounded , it seemed to me then , like any youthful heiress , by a small , but significant circle of admirers who blocked her face from my view . It was not until I 'd made my way to the front of the crowd , that I saw the tears on her terrible cheeks . ( Pause . A general muttering of tea service language . ) " Wo n't you have more ? " " Will you have a little ? " " One lump or two ? " " No thank you . " " Yes I believe I will . " " Petit fours are so bad for the figure . " " An unusual day . " " A most unusual day . " ( Pause. ) p. 5 P. T. BARNUM The year that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  1851 it would have been  --  the four sons of Henry and Mary James were treated to an awful surprise . A girl child came into the James family . A baby sister . In her Newport , Rhode Island home , Mary James produced a healthy daughter , Alice by name . ( Sits back , amused . ) I understand the James boys never forgave her . HENRY JAMES ( Disgusted . ) A daughter ? A sister for William , Wilkie , Robertson and me ? What an indignity . Girls did n't have much of a chance in our family , I 'm afraid . Alice became a life-long invalid . KATHERINE PEABODY LORING ( Tenderly . ) I took her to my bosom as though she were my own child . We were the same age , but I saw the damage they had done to Alice as clearly as I saw the color of her eyes , which were , incidentally , slate blue . She had beautiful eyes . I loved her eyes . DR . SIMON SLOPER Alice James was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marvel of patient orchestration . She had a genius for the well-timed disease . A real genius . What a performer she would have made . ( The characters look at each other , relinquish their grip on the tea service , and KATHERINE , MOTHER and BARNUM rise and move off stage ; BARNUM allowing the ladies to rise first and trailing huckster 's phrases ; good-naturedly , experimentally , almost to himself : ) p. 6 P. T. BARNUM That 's right , ladies and gentlemen . You heard what I said . The Elephant Woman . A gen-u-wine , home grown , American freak . ( HENRY JAMES and his protagonist from the novel Washington Square are left alone at tea . Their actions are precisely those of two late-Victorian gentlemen at a tea table ; that is , murderously banal . The actors ' voices must be intimate and possessive when discussing facts and feelings , and bored and correct when asking for butter or more tea . ) HENRY JAMES A pleasure to see you again , Dr. Sloper . DR . SIMON SLOPER It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES Surely not that long , sir . DR . SIMON SLOPER Five years , Mr. James and I still remember where our conversation left off . HENRY JAMES Let me see . I believe I had just said that the similarities between my sister Alice and your um patient Jane Merritt were striking . DR . SIMON SLOPER And then the Spanish-American War was declared . HENRY JAMES ( A little confused . ) Oh yes , of course . The war . ( He begins to resettle the tea things and he and DR . SLOPER both rearrange themselves in the attitudes of their conversation of five years ago. ) p. 7 HENRY JAMES ( Energetically . ) It is a striking coincidence , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER Both women being my patients , you mean . HENRY JAMES I mean both of them being what they were . So limited . DR . SIMON SLOPER My dear Mr. James . How can you compare your brilliant sister with my freak of nature ? More tea ? HENRY JAMES No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spent twenty years in bed and produced nothing more than a cancer of the breast . If that is n't freakish ( Shrugs , drinks tea . ) The butter , Dr. Sloper . DR . SIMON SLOPER Certainly , Mr. James . ( Forgets it . ) And my poor freak , Jane Merritt in her twenty years , I suppose you could say she produced nothing more than me . It was those experiments on ( corrects himself. ) uh with the Elephant Woman that made me famous , you know . ( Butters a scone energetically . ) She was to me what most humans spend their lives seeking out . My perfect subject , my sublime object , my inspiration ! ( Decrescendo . ) Uh sugar , Mr. James ? p. 8 HENRY JAMES Thank you doctor , I never take sugar . DR . SIMON SLOPER In the whole of my association with Jane Merritt , I could never bear to take my eyes from her . The attractions of such repulsiveness HENRY JAMES ( Visibly irritated . ) The butter , Dr. Sloper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Slight pause . Sounds of butter transferred to scones and other tea table business . ) HENRY JAMES Well , doctor , I could n't say that Alice had a repulsive physiognomy , but she did come into the world with her Mother 's architectural forehead and her Father 's flamboyant chin . ( Pause , shakes his head . ) A discouraging combination . ( Pause . ) I could scarcely tolerate the sight of her . ( Sighs . ) ( Pause . They muse . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Suddenly a toast . ) The ladies , Mr. James ? HENRY JAMES ( Roused , raises his cup . ) Indeed , Dr. Sloper . ( Pause . Again tea sounds . The moment the DOCTOR begins to speak , HENRY begins to sleep , nodding precariously into the scones. ) p. 9 DR . SIMON SLOPER More hot water ? Faces do have a terrible effect on us Mr. James . Careful , these scones are piping hot . I 've often wondered what it was in Jane Merritt 's expression that moved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Awakens abruptly . ) Doctor , doctor , life 's cup is brimming with imponderables . ( Holds his cup up . ) I will have a touch more water , if you do n't mind . My own dear Alice presented me with a similar question . ( Drinks his tea . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER Go on , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES Well I 've always wondered what it was in Alice 's eyes that drove me to pursue the secrets of her journal . She wanted that journal published , you know . Released into the world from the miasmal swamp of her opinions . ( Examines a toasted scone . ) Naturally , I burnt it to a crisp . DR . SIMON SLOPER Hmmmm . HENRY JAMES Yes . ( Pause . They muse . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( The toast . ) Ahh , the ladies , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES ( Raises his cup . ) Indeed , Dr. Sloper . ( An appreciative pause . They both lean back . Then they both lean forward. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIMON SLOPER I send to England for it . HENRY JAMES It has a distinctive taste , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER Does it , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES A peculiar color as well . DR . SIMON SLOPER Everyone says that . HENRY JAMES A certain cloying consistency . DR . SIMON SLOPER Ummmm . HENRY JAMES One might say an almost sacramental quality . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( As though paying a compliment . ) The quality is in your imagination . ( Pause . ) HENRY JAMES I believe I 'll take a biscuit . DR . SIMON SLOPER Please do , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES What a dry taste . DR . SIMON SLOPER Really . HENRY JAMES Dusty , a dusty sort of dough . DR . SIMON SLOPER They 're made in my kitchen , Mr. James . p. 11 HENRY JAMES It tastes ossified , it tastes god help usit tastes like bone . DR . SIMON SLOPER Impossible , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES ( A rising panic . ) Dr. Sloper . There is blood in my cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIMON SLOPER Just deserts , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES ( Calming . ) Ahhh yes . Quite right , doctor . ( Pause . He muses majestically . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( The toast . ) The ladies , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES ( Remembering . ) Ah yes , the ladies , Dr. Sloper . ( They raise their cups . The house lights go down . They lower their cups . The stage lights come up . They remain at tea throughout the play , moving in and out of the action as indicated . ) The Stage Any set you like so long as it is mostly vacant , clearly confining , and entirely out of the light . A few objects are possible , but they must be innocent ones : broken and/or remnants of other , wholler objects . What is present throughout the play is a bed , a sort of chiffonier ( its mirror is covered when it 's JANE MERRITT 's chiffonier , uncovered when it 's ALICE JAMES 's ) and a bedside chair . These props @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERRITT 's room and from another angle when they are in ALICE JAMES 's room . It 's always the same room , the arrangement is always the same ; it is merely our axis of vision that must appear to change . In the American Place Theatre production , the stage was split ; ALICE JAMES 's room and JANE MERRITT 's room faced and reflected each other . And the tea-table was cranked by cable from JANE MERRITT 's area in the first act to ALICE JAMES 's area in the second act . All the scenes centering on JANE are played in her room ; all the scenes centered on ALICE are played in her room . Jane Merritt 's Room in the Workhouse Stage lights come up on JANE 's room in the Workhouse . JANE 's MOTHER and the WARDEN  --  a large and imposing southern woman  --  are UPSTAGE RIGHT , in close conversation . An earlier JANE ( earlier than we see through the rest of the play ) is CENTER STAGE , hidden from view by a cluster of Workhouse inmates . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , a stammerer , a spasmodic adolescent all crowd around her staring and pointing , lifting her garments , removing her cloak . She remains hidden until the WARDEN ends the following scene , each of whose lines can be randomly assigned : " It 's a monster . " " A real monster . " " Did you did did did didyou didyou did you see the skin ? " " That 's not skin . " " It 's tree trunk . " " It 's elephant hide . " " Touch it go ahead . " " I dare you . " " How does it stand with legs like that . " " Never mind standing , how does it eat . " " The mouth looks sewed shut . " " Nobody 's gon na make me sit next to that thing . " " It 's a her , it 's a her , look at the chest ! " " It 's an elephant woman . " ( One of the idiots takes what appears to be a hat and mask from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " Can she walk ? " " Poor thing . " " Can she hear ? " " Poor thing . " " Can she speak ? " " The poor thing . " ( More punching and poking of the unseen JANE : the inmates are having a wonderful time . ) " I hear they 're going t ' set ' er up in a room here . " " Haw haw . I 'd set ' er up in a jar of formaldehyde , that 's what I 'd do . " " Ohhh Christ , hush your mouths , here comes Warden . " " Ssssh , ssssh , she 'll beat us . " " Quick , quick dress the thing . " " Put her cloak on . Hurry . " " Sssh for gawd 's sake . " " The hat . Get the hat . " " It 's Warden . " ( WARDEN and MOTHER move toward the cluster of freaks , MOTHER in mid-conversation . ) THE MOTHER And I named her after that woman who led the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , I thought she would need a strong name . p. 12 THE WARDEN Back ! Stand back you motherless children or I 'll beat you black and blue ! ( As the DOCTOR speaks , she charges the crowd , swatting indiscriminately . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( At tea , to HENRY . ) Jane , of course was her name . Elephant Woman came later . I often imagined that plain name was the source of her attraction for the novels of that other Jane , Miss Austen . Can you believe it , Mr. James ? That misbegotten , deformed creature fancied herself the heroine of an Austen novel , sitting in some sunlit corner of a rectory garden , embroidering antimacassars for her father , the vicar ! As if those horrible hands could hold a needle ! ( WARDEN subsides , breathing heavily . The inmates are strewn about the stage , momentarily subdued . The figure of JANE MERRITT draped in dark cloth is exposed ; an icon CENTER STAGE . ) THE MOTHER ( To WARDEN , to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a little thick , it was there was no reason to imagine what she would become . She smiled at me like any baby , she smiled frequently . She loved bright bits of color and she would always have me by her . ( The inmates regroup , a skirmish is imminent. ) p. 13 THE WARDEN ( To MOTHER as she terrorizes the freaks into a corner . ) You just keep talkin ' , honey , while I take care a my children here . DR . SIMON SLOPER Bright bits of color . Oh yes indeed . Mother 's rouge pots . The mother was a common whore , the child born a monster , and that 's the simple truth of it . THE WARDEN ( Mopping her brow . ) Now you all calm down , all a you ! ( To MOTHER . ) They just silly little children and they got to be treated as such . THE MOTHER Oh I knew something was n't right about her mouth . I 'm a seamstress and I know what it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . There was an extra piece on it , a flap of skin , that just grew and grew until she could n't nurse or cry or even smile . So I sewed the cape and mask and we made a game of it . Hiding from the light , we called it . And now my customers wo n't come for their fittings as long as that " monster " is there . And that monster is my only child and we are starving together Life is a terrible thing , Warden . Sometimes it 's a terrible thing . THE WARDEN ( To JANE , ignoring MOTHER . ) And this here 's mah new child . Well , darlin ' , let 's have a look at you . p. 14 THE MOTHER ( Moves in front of JANE . ) Warden , it 's too soon . She shrinks from the eyes of other people . In all her life , she 's hardly been in the light . THE WARDEN ( Hands on hips . ) Lady , this here 's the Workhouse . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of her . Now move yourself on outa here . And let me do mah duty . We 're holdin ' a class today . You just git along and leave her to me . ( JANE stands stolidly until her mother embraces her , then the one good arm , the left one , comes up and touches the MOTHER 's face . ) THE WARDEN Here now let 's have a look at you . ( WARDEN takes off JANE 's cloak . Then her hat and mask . ) THE WARDEN Oooooo mah gawd . Is that a human bein ' ? ( Everyone on stage freezes ; an awe-full moment . ) THE MOTHER ( As though in explanation . ) She was born at a carnival . I was at a carnival standing near the Elephant . He turned towards me , I began to bleed and she was born right there in the sawdust . THE WARDEN ( Transfixed , gentler . ) Go ' long now Miz Merritt . It 's gon na take quite a while to get her integrated in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go along . p. 15 THE MOTHER ( A list . ) They stone her , they shout at her , they knock her down , and now a carnival wants to buy her from me . ( Shudders . ) I am her mother and I can not stand the sight of her . Someone has to protect her DR . SIMON SLOPER Jane Merritt was abandoned to a workhouse when she was very young . I presume her mother 's lovers could n't tolerate the sight of their mistress 's little monster . THE MOTHER ( Takes a miniature of herself from her reticule and puts it in JANE 's good hand . ) Try to keep this longer than I 've kept you . ( Exits quickly . ) ( JANE releases one horrible wail . It is literally released  --  like a bird from a cage  --  and is as suddenly gone . WARDEN and JANE face each other , WARDEN still transfixed , as we are , by what JANE looks like . ) THE WARDEN ( Loudly , to break the horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , we gon ' have a class . We gon ' have a class in lookin ' and seein ' and ( Another look at JANE. ) bein ' a freak . Cause you all freaks and you might bettah learn to be what you are . Now pick up them books . ( Inmates stoop to a pile of tattered periodicals . ) You now ( To JANE. ) , what did she say yo ' name was . Jane . You , Jane Merritt , you stand here . Least you can do is learn to hold a book . ( The inmates assemble in front of WARDEN , weaving , bobbing , slobbering , some with their books upside down . Throughout WARDEN 's monologue they listen as intently as their various handicaps allow them to , and respond to her commands as well as they can . The staging here is surreal : a parody of all parodies. ) p. 16 THE WARDEN Now the first thing you want to learn in this class is HOW TO LOOK . You bettah know you all look real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOOK . Look to the side . Keep your head straight . Not up in the air . When you look to the side see what 's there . Just see what 's there . To the side , to the side , to the side . ( JANE looks down . ) In a freak class there 's no reason to look down . Everybody in the world already down on you . Just look to the side and see . See . See that bastard sneakin ' up on you . See his knife . Be AWARE . See that nice lady gon ' give you some money . See her look . She just waiting t ' see you smile . Limp on up to her now and hold out your hand . Good . Look to the side , to the side , to the side , to the side . See . In a freak class you got to be awake . You in training for your life . If you 're real lucky , one a them carnivals yo ' Mama was talking about might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register the word " Mama . " ) Now the last thing you got to learn in this class is how to laugh accordin ' to an audience . Most a you gon na end up bein ' looked at by a lot a people , and you got to learn to laugh real big so people think you 're happy . Nobody 's gon na pay to see you if you ca n't be happy for ' em . C'm on now . Let 's show her how to laugh . ( FREAKS and WARDEN laugh . ) AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA . ( The laughter degenerates into scuffles among the inmates and WARDEN moves in to swat them . ) " It 's her , Warden . It turns my stomach standing in front of her . " ( Points to JANE . ) " She smells terrible . " " She looks awful . " " She 's a real freak . " p. 17 THE WARDEN Hush yo mouths now . We gon ' have Dr. Sloper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a scientific curiosity . " Dr. Sloper ! " " He 's no doctor . " " He 's a ghoul . " " A grave-robber . " " A butcher .

" " He 's the he 's the he 's he 's he 's the freak ! " DR . SIMON SLOPER ( His most urbane , organ-like tone . ) I love all swelling things , Mr. James . Buds in spring , women 's bellies before they come to term , the waxing moon , and yes , one of my specialties , the vermiform appendix before it bursts . ( WARDEN herds the inmates offstage with cuffs and threats : " Classtime ! Get a move on monsters ! Let 's go ! Classtime ! " etc. , etc. , and JANE is left alone . She limps toward the bed , examines it , pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERRITT ( With great difficulty , the mouth is virtually sealed . ) This , my home . I have it . ( Takes out MOTHER 's miniature . ) This , my mother . I lose her . No mother no home . Now I have nothing . ( And the wail flies again like a bird from her throat. ) p. 18 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Largely . ) Well , Mr. James , Jane had everything . One short examination of her disordered body and the weight of all my interests amassed a gigantic precipitation and rained down a shower of gold into her lap . ( HENRY yawns hugely . ) She was the real thing , an anatomist 's dream , a true case of congenital deformity ! My first examination of her was a scientific revelation ( And the DOCTOR moves from his tea table into JANE 's room , carrying a satchel filled with scalpels . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( His most patronizing and mellifluous tone to JANE . ) Now my dear , I 'm going to speak very gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of my voice will calm you as it calms all my patients . ( Seeing her see his scalpels . ) No , no , do n't worry , I bring these with me as a matter of course . There will be no cutting , certainly not yet . I simply wish to examine you for a greater cause . Um Mother Science , my dear , Mother Science . ( As he examines JANE , he speaks to HENRY as though he were an entire anatomy class taking notes . The lights come up very bright . ) The subject of this disorder is a woman aged twenty-four . The disorder concerns both the cutaneous and the osseous systems of her body . With the curious exception of the um genitalia and the left arm and hand , the subject has tubercles covering the whole of her integument . The subcutaneous tissue has greatly increased in amount and density ; the surface of the integument itself shows a papillomatous condition , particularly exuberant over the dorsal region and the gluteal districts . The entire bone structure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bands of connective tissue seal off her mouth and left ear . Are there any questions so far ? p. 19 HENRY JAMES Can she speak , doctor ? DR . SIMON SLOPER Her power of speech , if she had it , would be totally impaired . HENRY JAMES How does she move ? DR . SIMON SLOPER Articulation of all joints ( He moves her right knee , she jerks away. )  --  oops , sorry my dear  --  is extremely difficult . There appears to be an old injury to the right hip which has resulted in a painful ( He touches her hip , she jerks away. )  --  tch , sorry again , very painful and extremely restrictive displasia . HENRY JAMES ( Reaching for a biscuit . ) And eating . What about eating ? DR . SIMON SLOPER A liquid diet is barely possible . ( Carelessly . ) More than likely we 'll run a tube down her nasal passage and feed her that way . It 's easier on the staff . HENRY JAMES What about evacuation ? DR . SIMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? HENRY JAMES ( Embarrassed . ) How does she do it ? DR . SIMON SLOPER As best she can , sir , as best she can . p. 20 HENRY JAMES ( Changing the subject . ) What is your prognosis , doctor ? DR . SIMON SLOPER Death at an early age , I 'm afraid . Though , certainly , it 's far too soon to rule out the possibility of a surgical cure . I have great faith in my little knives gentlemen , great faith . HENRY JAMES You intend to operate , then ? DR . SIMON SLOPER I intend to examine the subject ( Ominous. ) much more thoroughly . And then make my decision . No further questions ? ( Pause . ) In sum , then , the subject before us can barely walk , eat , speak , or eliminate , and it is to be profoundly hoped that the god who invested her with this condition , also withheld from her the power to perceive it . Thank you very much , gentlemen . ( To JANE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mother Science . I want you to hold very still , yes , very good , that 's right . I know you ca n't understand me , but there will be a flash of light ( JANE registers horror at the word " light , " the light when it comes is blinding , there is a blackout , and the DOCTOR is back at the tea table . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER She was a world , I tell you Mr. James she was an entire universe p. 21 Jane Merritt 's Room in the American Museum P. T. BARNUM ( Offstage , picking up where he left off in the lobby . ) " That 's right , folks , she 's the best bargain in the solar system .

Sounds of satisfaction . ) JANE MERRITT ( With difficulty , but clearer than before . ) I 'm hungry . p. 22 P. T. BARNUM Now Jane , you know you ca n't eat before a show . You 'll spoil the performance . ( Regards the bottle . ' ) Expensive brand . But worth it . Well worth it . ( He drinks . ) JANE MERRITT I 'm cold . P. T.

The people like to see what they 're paying for . ( Holds bottle up to the light . ) Shines just like gold ( Raises bottle to his mouth . ) JANE MERRITT My mouth is bleeding again . P. T. BARNUM ( Stops cold . ) What ! Blast that doctor ! We ca n't have blood for the performance ! The people wo n't put up with blood ! He guaranteed there 'd be no blood ! p. 23 JANE MERRITT The knives he used were not clean . P. T. BARNUM Damn the fool ! I 'll have his diploma . Doctors . Licensed scoundrels ! That 's what they are . Legal murderers ! ( Calming . ) How 's your speech . Any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARNUM ( As though noticing it for the first time . ) It is better , much better . Before he cut that flap back all you could do was slobber . There 's an improvement , alright . JANE MERRITT It 's easier to speak . When I want to . P. T. BARNUM ( Anxious . ) And you can laugh ? Can you laugh yet ? JANE MERRITT ( Patiently . ) He made me try . I can laugh a little . P. T. BARNUM ( Relieved . ) Good , good , people love to see a freak laugh . ( Pause . ) God knows why . Well , we 'll just have to put up with the bleeding for a while . Maybe the crowd wo n't notice it . JANE MERRITT There is no crowd . P. T. BARNUM ( Self-important . ) There will be , my dear .

There should be seven of them , as in the story the Persian poet Rumi tells about the seven blind people confronting an elephant .

Each of the Blind concentrates on touching a different area of what passes for JANE 's body . The movement of the hands of the Blind must be precisely choreographed so that the icon becomes one of Elephant Woman being created as a sculpture by the hands of the Blind . The music , the modalities , should seem to come out of what the hands are touching . A real effort must be made by the actors to receive and transmit the vibrational frequencies of Elephant Woman 's body . At the moment the icon is complete , that is , at the moment the Blind have created a sculpture of sound to enclose the sculptured form of Elephant Woman  --  they must seem to vanish from her room .

Monster could not bear the light , or that the famous Elephant Woman was remarked by the crowds who viewed her to have had tears running down her terrible cheeks  --  only then was I certain that this was the creature I 'd examined in the Workhouse on that fateful day . For that poor , stunned specimen displayed the most painful aversion to any form of light She broke down completely during the last series of daguerrotypes . I have treasured a few prints that show her tears . See here and here Mr. James  --  imagine tears from such a creature ! HENRY JAMES ( A brave show of wakefulness and response . ) Tch tch shocking . Perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLOPER Yes , yes it was shocking . Something about the blinding flash of the gunpowder terrified the life out of her p. 28 Jane Merritt 's Room Inside Her Mother Lights come up slowly on JANE , alone in her room . She is remembering what it was like to be inside her mother and , remembering , speaks about it : JANE MERRITT It is dark in here . I am crowded by walls of flesh not my own . My eyes  --  shut . My ears  --  useless . Folded tight against my head . My thick skin is wrinkled . My tusks are little buds . My trunk is rolled up . Every part of me is curved or curled against every other part . I am in a prison to grow . But I grow strangely . I can feel it.Suddenly I hear my father 's voice , speaking from another place . He is loudly calling my Elephant name . The soft clotted blood on which I rest is sucked away . Flesh not my own begins to press and release me . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past this pain to other pain . Flesh not my own closes around me . I give up . I am renewed . I push again . Flesh closes around me again . I give up again . I am little . I do not move . Then I push again . In a river of liquids not my own , I push out into blinding light . Now the walls are not the walls I know . I hear my father calling my Elephant name nearby . The light is like a loud noise . Something has happened . ( With wonder . ) My trunk is gone . The buds of my tusks retreated . My large ears no more . In their place , lumps of bone , strings of flesh . I am not what I was . Something has happened . I am not what I am supposed to be . My mother sees me between her thighs . She knows something has happened . When she sees me , her scream is as loud as the light .

" Oh Alice , Alice , what an inhospitable temperament . Ahhh , here we are . ( Reads slowly as though experiencing it . ) " On the morning of my thirteenth birthday , and I remember still how sudden the impulse was , I walked into my brother Harry 's bathroom , and I carefully removed his razor from its box , and I carefully stropped it back and forth as I 'd seen him do so many times , and I carefully shaved off every hair on my body except the hairs growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful that although it was the first time I had used a razor in that way , I did not experience a single cut .

I was able to stanch the cuts on my face with small pieces of lambswool which I wet under the faucet as I had seen Harry do . Until it dried , the wool blended nicely with my skin . The cuts on my arms were deeper , somehow , and harder to stop from bleeding . There is something in the conformation of an arm that does not lend itself to the razor . The most I could do with these cuts was to conceal them under the awful , long-sleeved middy blouses that Aunt Kate so persistently sewed for me . At odd moments during the school day , I would look down to see the white sleeves of my middy dotted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to develop complicated rituals that kept my arms below the level of the school desk so that I would not have to see what my brother 's razor had done to me .

You 're so sneaky . HENRY JAMES My dear . How are you . ALICE JAMES ( Cheerfully . ) Dying , as usual . HENRY JAMES Alice , I wish you would concentrate more on cheerfulness . ALICE JAMES Ah Harry . What does it matter . I 'm here at last , with you and Katherine to care for me . ( Ominous . ) Until the end .

( Coyly . ) Several old friends of the family happened to be catching trains at just that moment , and so were able to watch me thrashing about on the floor of the grand concourse . p. 35 HENRY JAMES Alice , Alice ! And the sentence . I suppose you could n't have an attack without saying that sentence . ALICE JAMES Katherine tells me I was in full voice . She never heard me articulate it so clearly , she said .

ALICE JAMES ( Happy as a clam . ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY JAMES If the James family has a social position left , Alice , it 's no thanks to you . I suppose you were examined by a physician ? ALICE JAMES They called in that Dr. Sloper again . You know . The one who operated on his own daughter and killed her . ( Admiring . ) He has such an extensive collection of scalpels . HENRY JAMES Well , Alice . What is it this time ? Neurasthenia ? Hyperaesthenia ? Nervous prostration ? You always inspire doctors to such impressive diagnoses . ALICE JAMES ( Dimpling as for a compliment . ) Nothing of the kind , Harry . Dr. Sloper said I was quite strong enough to go on having attacks for years if I wanted to . He made me very happy . He did want to examine a little further a lump he found on my right breast . p. 36 HENRY JAMES On your right b . delicacy was never your strong point , Alice .

You know her taste for curiosities . HENRY JAMES And is she come to stay here forever also ? ALICE JAMES You know , Harry , that Katherine is devoted to me . HENRY JAMES I see . It is forever then . ALICE JAMES Take comfort , brother . I may not last the year . HENRY JAMES Alice . If I have one certainty in this diseased and distracted world , it is the strength of your constitution .

I like your novels enormously . Especially the ones you steal from me . HENRY JAMES ( Stiffly . ) I have no idea what you 're referring to . ALICE JAMES Brother . Year after year you have entered my sickrooms armed with paper and pencil or with your prodigious memory and you have taken careful note of my valetudinarian ramblings .

( Blackout on stage , lights up on the tea table . HENRY now sits in the host 's seat . ) HENRY JAMES Alice was the most severe trial of my entire life , Dr. Sloper . And yet , she fascinated me , utterly fascinated me . I believe the tea is ready now . DR . SIMON SLOPER Thank you , I never take tea at this hour . It has a desperate effect on my sense of time . HENRY JAMES ( Not at all interested . ) Really ? Have some marmalade then , the biscuits are pure poison without it . Well , as I say , my sister Alice nearly drove me mad .

Then she resisted dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it was your diagnosis that killed her , not the tumour . Your diagnosis and the scalpels . ( Slyly . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Shakes his watch . ) I ( Shake , shake. ) never had the occasion to use any of my instruments in treating your sister , Mr. James . It was a great disappointment to me . ( Shake , shake. ) p. 39 HENRY JAMES I meant her obsession with scalpels , of course , doctor . Any physician in the Adams Nervous Asylum can tell you about the hundreds of butter knives and nail scissors Alice had secreted in her dresser drawers  --  and the pages of comparisons between the pains in her body and the kinds of cuts different blades can inflict . ( Grim . ) I saw them all before they were incinerated . DR . SIMON SLOPER What is this nonsense about my scalpels , then ? And do you have the time , Mr. James ? HENRY JAMES It 's tea time , Dr. Sloper . Have another biscuit . Well it seems that when Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the seal on her obsession . She had never seen anything quite like them before . And to make matters worse  --  will you have some tea now , doctor ? DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Shaking his timepiece . ) Thank you , it 's not time yet . HENRY JAMES To make matters worse she began to insert the word " scalpel " into that disgusting sentence she used to say when she was having her attacks . DR . SIMON SLOPER Oh yes , you mean HENRY JAMES ( Quickly . ) Never mind , doctor , I heard quite enough of that phrase while Alice was alive . The family calculated once , that from the time she was nineteen , Alice averaged five major attacks per month , day in and day out , good weather or bad , until her demise . That is to say , by conservative estimate , my gently reared and modest sister Alice spewed out that horrible sentence of hers at least seventy times a year . Seventy times ! p. 40 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Still shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon ? DR . SIMON SLOPER Tea-time . Alice was always " taken " during tea-time .

HENRY JAMES ( Hand on marmalade . ) I ca n't hold it back any longer ! DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Hopefully . ) The marmalade ? HENRY JAMES No , no doctor , the truth . The truth is that Alice was a great trial to me , but not the greatest one . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Dully . ) The marmalade , Mr. James .

SIMON SLOPER ( Brightens . ) Ah , I remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyscraper . The mononument . The moment Alice met that woman , she took to her bed prostrate with love .

Oh ! Miss Loring . ( Embarrassed docility , nervous laugh . ) Wherever is Alice ? KATHERINE PEABODY LORING She had another fit this afternoon . ( Bitterly . ) Dr. Sloper took her to the hospital . HENRY JAMES ( Exasperated . ) God , what an inconvenience . ( Collects himself . ) I mean , how is she ? Is she recovering ? p. 51 KATHERINE PEABODY LORING She always recovers , Mr. James . No thanks to the doctor . She never would have gone to the hospital if she 'd been conscious . She ca n't bear waking up in a white room . HENRY JAMES ( Nods . ) Yes , I understand . It 's too much like death . KATHERINE PEABODY LORING ( Bitterly . ) I could n't stop him from taking her . He insisted upon his medical rights .

HENRY JAMES Miss Loring , you 're joking . KATHERINE PEABODY LORING And just possibly , the tip of my right boot came into rather painful contact with the middle portion of his left shin . HENRY JAMES ( Horrified . ) A brawl ? Here in my house ? With my honored friend ? Over the prostrate form of my sister ? ( Looks like he 's going to faint . ) KATHERINE PEABODY LORING Here , Mr. James , why do n't you lie down . I 'm sure that Alice , if she were here and not in some horrible hospital , would invite you to use the chaise . ( HENRY staggers to the chaise , muttering , " This is too much , really this is too much , " etc .

You just rest here awhile . Alice wo n't mind . She 's probably still unconscious , anyway . I 'll go into the kitchen and fix you a cup of chamomile tea . I 'll make sure it 's chamomile and not that dry tea you 've been serving lately . Alice and I have n't enjoyed that tea a bit . ( KATHERINE exits . HENRY wriggles around trying to get comfortable , there is a clanking sound behind him and he reaches under the pillow and draws out an entire set of butter knives tied up with a ribbon . He holds them up in disbelief . Blackout . ) ( Lights dim on stage ; tableau of NURSE massaging ALICE in DR . SLOPER 's hospital , during the following scene between HENRY and the DOCTOR .

If we have no art , then , certainly , we have no life . Think of it . ( Pause . ) The natural cause of death . Well sir ? p. 53 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Finally lured into it . ) Death has no natural causes , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES I hoped you 'd say that , doctor . More tea ? DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Unstoppable . ) Death , Mr. James , is almost always the result of an unnecessary exploration . This gentleman , seeking the pleasures of youth , pushed his heart too hard . That one , pursuing wealth , worked his only son into the grave . That lady 's compensatory drinking exhausted her liver ; this one 's consumption of tonics destroyed her bladder .

HENRY JAMES Something a little less dry . DR . SIMON SLOPER What about a Japanese tea . HENRY JAMES I have one right here , doctor . Just let me reach it for you . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Uncertainly . ) Tea makes everything clearer . HENRY JAMES Here we are , doctor . Japanese tea . DR . SIMON SLOPER Ummm . It smells very fine . HENRY JAMES ( Beaming . ) Does n't it .

( Placatingly . ) But it is an amazing instrument . I have nothing in my collection to match it . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Horribly disappointed . ) Oh ? I did n't know you had a collection . ALICE JAMES ( Self-deprecatingly . ) A small one . Penknives , poignards , stilettos , hatpins , razor-blades  --  household items . Nothing serious . Nothing like yours , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Visibly relieved . ) Well . In that case , let me just show you the latest of the Sloper scalpels . The one I hope to be remembered for .

DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Dismissing it . ) In a manner of speaking . ( Pause . A sly look . ) Uh Miss James . Have you ever considered having the operation ? p. 58 ALICE JAMES The tumour is in my breast , doctor . Not below it . DR . SIMON SLOPER It 's an operation every woman should have at your time in life . ALICE JAMES I think not , Dr. Sloper . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Inspired . ) We could begin with the vesico-vaginal fistula operation . Quite unnecessary , in your case , but a beautiful operation , nonetheless . It collapses the vagina and makes those monthly infirmities you women suffer entirely unnecessary . ALICE JAMES I have n't menstruated in years . DR . SIMON SLOPER Then we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me hundreds of attempts to perfect that one . I wish we could keep you conscious for it . You would so appreciate the precision . ALICE JAMES I have a certain attachment to my organs , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER Then , of course , if you 're willing  --  and so many of my female patients are  --  we could ( Dramatic tone. ) strike at the root of the evil . We could cut everything out . We could have a FULL HYSTERECTOMY . ( Appreciative pause by the DOCTOR ) What do you say , Miss James . p. 59 ALICE JAMES I say CERTAINLY NOT . What about my breast tumour . Is n't that what I 'm here for ? DR . SIMON SLOPER Oh that . It 's completely inoperable . If I cut you for that , you 'd bleed to death in twenty minutes .

( Her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few words are in stentorian voice . ) Katherine , Katherine , give me that morphine ! I can not bear the pain ! It leaks and seeps into every corner of my life ! ( Again , a spasm . ) I yearn for my death but I have n't the strength to go to it alone . Katherine ! I beg you , give me that drug ! You did it for your mother ! ( Accusing and very loud . ) You did it for your mother ! ( Blackout . Lights up on that corner of ALICE 's room in HENRY 's house which represents the Operating Room . The DOCTOR in his white coat is still performing the autopsy on the body of JANE MERRITT . The NURSE is not present. ) p. 79 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Back still to us . ) Oh Jesus Christ ! What a thing to witness ! Oh horror , horror , horror ! Who is the god that could leak life into such a form ! Look at her ovaries ! Look at her stomach ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for godssake Nurse come here and look at her breast ! ( Instant blackout . Lights up on HENRY who is pacing the stage in ) Alice 's Room in Henry 's House HENRY JAMES She followed me for spite , pure spite . I know very well she wanted to die in New England . ( Pause . ) But how my writing soared when she was with me . All the eyes at all the windows in my house of fiction were open wide . ( Pause , a shudder . ) Ugh ! That forehead ! The eyes underneath ! ( Pause . ) Every night I dream lumps of bone and strands of flesh . Every day I struggle to disentangle the meaning of what I write from what I am writing . ( Pause . ) I ca n't go on without Alice . I know that now . ( Pause . ) I wonder how I ever thought I could ? ( Blackout . Lights up again dimly on KATHERINE and ALICE . ALICE 's body is almost gone , now , but the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 80 KATHERINE PEABODY LORING Alice , darling will you speak louder . I can scarcely hear you . ALICE JAMES ( Broken speech , the words constantly intersected by pain . ) This block of stone in my breast has moved to fill my throat , Kath I can not push the words past it very well . KATHERINE PEABODY LORING Try Alice oh ca n't you try . I 'll write everything down , everything everything . ALICE JAMES It is too late to expect anything important of me , now , my darling Just let me say my sentence once for you . I can not hold my head up any longer . KATHERINE PEABODY LORING Say it , Alice , speak it to me . It will be the last thing I write in your journal . ALICE JAMES ( Raises herself up with her arms around KATHERINE 's neck and speaks her sentence in KATHERINE 's ear . KATHERINE 's face in great pain , ALICE falls back smiling , and speaks with great difficulty . ) Remember me to Mr. Barnum . ( Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment very bright and blinding on the corner of the hospital where JANE MERRITT 's autopsy is being performed ; the DOCTOR 's white jacket is now entirely covered with blood . NURSE is present , but mute and stationary . She holds the Uterine Guillotine in one hand. ) p. 81 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( In an ecstasy . ) The blood , the blood , the blood covers me ! ! Oh it 's red , it 's human 's blood ! I 've found the thing I needed to know . Nurse , Nurse , who would have thought it . Joan Merritt , Jane Merritt , the Elephant Woman has blood as red as yours ! ! ( Instant blackout . Quick return to the tea table where HENRY and the DOCTOR sit . MR . BARNUM 's cane hangs casually over the middle chair . They are whiter , older , more crotchety . Parts of the tea service are missing , now , from the table . The characters ' interaction with the missing parts should be a silent one . HENRY might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOCTOR could begin to pour tea into an absent cup ; some one of them might turn to ask MR . BARNUM again if he could tolerate a biscuit . The charade must gradually run down and HENRY and the DOCTOR should be left facing each other for a moment . A silence in which each one in turn leans forward to begin something , gives it up , and drops back in his chair . HENRY pulls himself together first . ) HENRY JAMES Alice was n't buried until a full week after she died . It took the railroad five days to carry her body from New York to Cambridge . The train was struck by a horse cart in New York State , derailed in Western Massachusetts , and stopped for half a day in Brookline when it ran out of coal . The railway conductor told me that he had never in his life had such a journey . ( Pause , slowly . ) During all that time Katherine Loring sat up with Alice 's body in the baggage car . She sat dry-eyed and stony-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , to be writing sentences in a small black book . ( Pause . ) When the train finally reached Boston and Alice was um unloaded and carried to the platform , a careless porter set her down clumsily and the lid of her coffin sprang open . Katherine Loring had walked on ahead , so no one with sufficient authority was present to push down the coffin lid . And so Alice remained there on the platform of the second largest railway station in the Northeastern United States for quite a while p. 82 DR . SIMON SLOPER Her last public performance , you might say . HENRY JAMES It seems that a large crowd gathered  --  how often , after all , is such an exhibition presented in a public place ? I was told that before Miss Loring returned , a man in a tattered coat began to offer refreshments for sale and even to sell tickets for what he promised were further revelations about the dead woman . My sister , Alice . ( Pause . ) The ticket seller was later driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize him . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( A look at BARNUM 's empty chair . ) Mr. Barnum left his cane here . HENRY JAMES ( Carefully . ) I noticed that he had . ( Pause . ) DR . SIMON SLOPER ( A fresh energy . ) Of course all I heard about your dear sister 's death were the medical rumours . That , in her coffin , her fingernails were observed to have grown an inch . HENRY JAMES ( Nods . ) They did grow . It was a most amazing thing . Alice 's last collection of pointed instruments . You might say that she was buried armed to the teeth . ( Slight chuckles from both men . Pause. ) p. 83 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Tasting . ) The tea is quite cold . HENRY JAMES ( Tasting . ) The biscuits are very dry . ( Glumly . ) The butter is gone . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Irritated . ) Where 's my tea cup ? HENRY JAMES ( Testily . ) I could have sworn I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know ( Stops . ) I have n't really performed a successful operation since Jane Merritt 's autopsy . HENRY JAMES My books have sunk like stones in still water since Alice died . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Ostentatiously checking his watch . ) Face it , my dear sir . Life is far too crowded an experience to have in it a room for your happiness . ( Slight pause . ) Or mine , for that matter . HENRY JAMES ( Sighs heavily . ) I 'd better ring for more tea things . Let me see , we need a saucer , another cup , the jam , the cream and ( Looks around the table. ) hmmm everything else . p. 84 DR . SIMON SLOPER Do n't bother ringing , Mr. James . I 've lost my appetite . ( Suddenly P.T. BARNUM sticks his head into Alice 's Room . ) P. T. BARNUM Ladies and Gentlemen , Gentlemen and Ladies , welcome to P.T. Barnum 's street museum . Please have your money ready . That 's right , folks . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cucumber man , see the human frankfurter from Fiji , see the incredible contortionist from the Carolinas . And make sure you see the most fascinating bit of exotica we have . Yes , that 's correct , she 's just behind the curtain . The child you 've all heard so much about is with us at last ! That 's right , folks , it 's Rhinoceros Woman . The most extraordinary female freak of the decade . Her elder sister cut quite a figure here and abroad a few years ago , but she was nothing compared to this little girl . This little girl is a real freak . That 's right , folks , line forms to the right . Rhinoceros Woman walks , she talks , she even laughs like a human being , but due to a dreadful accident of birth she appears to be part rhino . That 's what I said , Madam , the girl looks just like a little Rhinoceros . ( A long , long laugh from BARNUM and his head disappears . Pause . During BARNUM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tea table and he and the DOCTOR have twisted around to look at BARNUM . In the pause between the end of BARNUM 's spiel and the regrouping of the tea ceremony , much is indicated , nothing said . Then HENRY and the DOCTOR resume , as though nothing has intervened since their last complaints at the missing parts of the tea set. ) p. 85 DR . SIMON SLOPER I was sure you said your saucer was missing . HENRY JAMES It is missing , doctor , and I 'm not happy about it . DR . SIMON SLOPER Oh , well , happiness HENRY JAMES Why that 's odd . DR . SIMON SLOPER What 's odd . Could you hand me whatever 's left of those biscuits . My appetite seems to be returning . HENRY JAMES That 's very odd . The butter-knives are gone . Every damned one of them . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( With some asperity . ) My , my . Is there anyone else in your household who collects pointed instruments ? Please pass the biscuits , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand and continues to hold them . ) HENRY JAMES This is most upsetting , doctor . ( Gets up with plate of biscuits which the DOCTOR is now grabbing for , and begins to pace . ) I can tolerate bone in my biscuits . I can put up with blood in my cup . But , doctor , I warn you , I will not do without my butter-knife . No sir , I will not do without my butter-knife . DR . SIMON SLOPER Dammit , Mr. James , give me those biscuits immediately ! I do n't care what you 've ground up in them  --  book reviews , Japanese citizens , give them here , sir ! They 're mine ! Give them here ! ( DOCTOR and HENRY both on their feet now . They begin to struggle trance-like over the plate , come out of their separate reveries and relapse into horribly embarrassed , self-exculpatory chuckles. ) p. 86 HENRY JAMES Heee heee heee . DR . SIMON SLOPER Aha ha ha . HENRY JAMES After you , sir . DR . SIMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist . DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Angry . ) Be seated , Mr. James . HENRY JAMES ( Vicious . ) You first , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER I will not . ( Pause . They look at each other and begin the embarrassed laughing again . ) HENRY JAMES ( Conciliatory . ) I think we might sit down together , doctor . DR . SIMON SLOPER What a good idea , Mr. James . ( Plunk . The sit down exactly together . ) HENRY JAMES Well , sir , I see we have only one cup between us . DR . SIMON SLOPER That 's all we need for the toast , Mr. James . We certainly do n't need more than one cup for the toast . HENRY JAMES Quite right , doctor . ( Slight pause . ) Which toast is that ? p. 87 DR . SIMON SLOPER ( Slightly puzzled . ) Why our usual toast , Mr. James : ( Raises his cup high . ) To Jane Merrit and Alice James and all ladies everywhere . ( Ringing tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and puts it on the cup also , slowly . ) To the ladies , doctor . Who would have thought their blood could be so red . ( Freeze . Instant blackout )
