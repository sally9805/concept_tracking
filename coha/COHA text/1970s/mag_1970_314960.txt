All this year , Wall Street has been enacting a financial version of The Perils of Pauline , with the customers playing Pauline . Time and again , investors have been threatened with loss of the money and stock held for them by brokerage houses that have gone to the brink of insolvency-or fell over it . Repeatedly , the financial community has prevented disaster by rounding up new capital for the failing firm , arranging a shotgun merger or , as a last resort , ransoming customers ' stock by making payments out of a $55 million New York Stock Exchange trust fund . Last week Wall Street managed the most dramatic rescue yet , but in doing so apparently exhausted its resources for continuing the cliff-hanger act . <P> Shaky Capital . This time the prospective failure was large enough to threaten not only investors but much of the securities business . The firm about to go under was Goodbody &; Co. , whose 250,000 customer accounts make it the fifth biggest brokerage in the nation . The collapse of a company so huge seemed likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other firms , triggering a panic . <P> Like many other brokerages , Goodbody was shakily capitalized . About half of its capital , now down to about $10 million , consisted of loans advanced by partners and other investors for 90 days at a time . Its record keeping got into a horrendous snarl . By mid-October an exchange-ordered audit disclosed that Goodbody held some $10 million in stock that was not even entered on its books-while another $10 million of stock that was recorded on the books could not be found . Operating losses this year totaled $8 million by the end of September , and partners and other lenders began withdrawing capital in amounts large enough to put Goodbody in violation of a stock exchange rule that a member firm must have capital equal to at least 5% of its liabilities . <P> Finally , the Big Board gave Goodbody an ultimatum : come up with additional funds by Nov. 5 or face suspension-a move that would have forced liquidation . Early last week , no one had worked up the nerve to mount a rescue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer available ; it is fully committed to help customers of ten brokerages that earlier tumbled into insolvency . On Tuesday , the exchange 's governors and representatives of 20 of the richest investment houses were summoned , on an hour 's notice , to an emergency meeting in the exchange 's dark-paneled board room . President Robert Haack told them they had to come up with some salvage plan or face a major crisis . By process of elimination , Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith , by far the biggest U.S. brokerage , was selected as savior . Clifford Michel , managing partner of Loeb , Rhoades , explains : " One strong , viable firm had to take over , and Merrill Lynch was the only one that had the capital , the muscle and the talent . "
