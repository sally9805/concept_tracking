txt ISRAEL SHOULD respond to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat 's visit to Jerusalem with a " reciprocal act of innovation " and give up substantial territory to achieve peace , according to former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban , In an interview in Chicago Eban expressed hope that the Israeli government of Prime Minister Menahem which until now has opposed major territorial concessions , would change its stand . Eban came out in favor of a separate Israeli peace settlement with Egypt ? something Sadat has so far rejected ? and expressed confidence that this would lead to peace settlements with Jordan and Syria . 11E ALSO SUGGESTED that a peace conference In Geneva may now be irrelevant , with the parties able to negotiate directly in the Middle East . Eban came to Chicago to promote his autobiography , just published by Random Home . The former minister fought Israel 's successful battle ter acceptance by the United Nations when the state was created in 1948 and was for years its lead . ' Ing voice in international affairs . When Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since May has been a representative of the opposition Labor Party in the Knesset parliament . AN EDITED TRANSCRIPT of the Interview follows . Q -- Ilas Sadat 's visit to Israel pm.duced any tasting achievement , anything ? that would survive should lie be assassinated or removed from office ? A ? The question implies he is in greater risk than before . The fact is that he is a stronger , more respected figure than before . We should not look on him with compassion as a man in danger but as ? one at the crest of his success . Questions like that used to be asked about . King Hussein of Jordan . It is not the moderates who get assassinated , but the radicals , Hussein has gone to the funerals of most of the radicals who opposed him . Sadat has done one of the most enduring things in world history by ending the discussion about Israel 's legitimate 1 place in the Middle East . That 's something that can not be changed . He , there : fore , dwarfs all other Arab leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Israel . Q ? In view of the negative Arab re ? action to the visit , does n't It behoove " Israel now to show some greater next // Q. &A.; Eban 's idea for peace : Give up piece of Israel // bility on peace terms that would ease the pressures on Sadat ? A ? I do n't believe the personal risk of Sadat merits a national risk by Israel . But now that Israel 's sovereignty has been recognized , we shall have to emerge out of generalities into precision . For Egypt , peace can not be simply an Israeli signature on Egyptian terms . For Israel , we will have to become very specific on the question of terrorists and boundaries , and very soon . Q ? Sadat has said Israeli security will depend not on territorial acquisition but on the Intentions of its neighbors backed up by whatever international guarantees Israel wants . Would you favor a resort to guarantees , and , it so , what kind ? A ? I agree with him territory is not the only attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not get Israel to talk about security without at the same time talking about territory . As for guarantees , no one knows quite what this means . It the United States is supposed to guarantee that it will send troops if Israel Is attacked , no one would believe it , we would n't want it , and the American people would n't sustain it . I do n't say guarantees have no value . But I ca n't imagine Israel saying we will live with a dangerous border in a certain area because we have a guarantee of American support . Q ? Would you favor substantial territorial concessions ? A ? I believe it and my party believes it , and in every sector Egyptian , Jordanian , Syrian ) . In a peace treaty , we should only seek to ' keep territory essential for our security . Q ? You believe It , but what about the Begin government ? A ? That 's the great question . So far when faced with such situations , Mr. Begin has shown an ability to compromise between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . The question is whether , for the sake of peace with the Arabs , they Begin 's Likud Bloc are capable of separating themselves from their pre-election slogans , just as Sadat separated himself from the general theme of Arab propaganda . What Is needed on our aide is a reciprocal act of innovation , not out of deference to Sadat 's position , but for the sake of capitalizing on a prospect of peace that seems more tangible than ever before . There is a great need for new thinking . Q ? Would you favor a separate agreement with Egypt ? A ? Thera is nothing wrong with a separate agreement . It is certainly better than nothing at all . Every forward step In the last 30 years has been the result of an individual Egyptian action . If Egt can not sign without the agree . ment of everybody else , that is a limitation of its sovereignty that I would be surprised to hear they are willing to accept . If Israel were to be addressed by any country seeking peace , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cousins and aunts with you . I believe it is more likely that Egypt will sign first , with the others following , rather than having an orchestration of all of them . Q ? Foreign Minister Moshe Dam said Israel would sign a separate peace , after Begin said Israel would not seek to drive a wedge bewteen the Arabs . How do you reconcile those statements ? A ? It is not a wedge between the Arabs if one of them makes peace . If the choice is between unity and none wanting peace , or disunity with some wanting peace , we prefer the latter . Ct ? Do you believe Geneva is the best forum for achieving peace ? A ? I ca n't believe the centrality of the Geneva conference is very relevant . It was just a device for getting Israel and the Arabs into some communication . Now we are in direct communication . Cairo and Jerusalem are clearly more important than Geneva . The Arab governments find it very hard to negotiate at any level except the top level , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you believe Syria and Jordan eventually will accept Sadat 's peace initiative ? A ? With Jordan it would n't involve a change of policy because Hussein has approved . The question is whether he develops the courage to say publicly what se always said privately . It would be absurd for Hussein to object to meetings of Arabs and Israelis a reference to secret meetings Hussein has held with Israeli officials , I believe Hussein supports what Sadat is doing , even if be was surprised by the method . The same Is true of the Saudis . Syria is rather less vital , but it has always come in last on any Initiative Egypt has taken . Q ? In your autobiography you say that the Palestinian question Is the core of the dispute In the Middle East . How would you solve it ? A ? Palestine is a part of the question of permanent boundaries between Israel and Jordan . There should be a triangular negotiation involving Israel , Jordan , and Palestinian Arabs . There are just as many Palestinians east of the Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank should revert to Arab rule under a peace treaty . What Israel will not do is hand territory over to those who would use it as a springboard for assault on our territory . If the Palestinians do not accept that , they are responsible for the deadlock . We have no obligation to cut oar suit to the cloth of the Palestine Liberation Organization , which does not want peace , sip principle .
