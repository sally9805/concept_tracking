TOWARD A RADICAL MIDDLE by Renata Adler. 259 pages . Random House . $7.95 . <P> <P> The Old Journalism examined the handwriting on the wall . The New Journalism writes on the wall . But there is a Third Journalism whose sole preoccupation is the wall itself-the texture and structure of society . Its practitioners suffer an absence of dazzle , and their egos-like poltergeists-throw no shadow at all . But once a specific event has passed , it is their witness that shows the most significant truths and the fewest signs of age . <P> Renata Adler is a Third Journalist . " I guess I am part of an age group she is 32 that , through being skipped , through never having had a generational voice , was forced into the broadest possible America , " she writes . " In a way , in culture and in politics , we are the last custodians of language-because of the books we read and because history , in our time , has wrung so many changes on the meaning of terms and we , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distortion of them . " <P> Luck and Tendencies . Such a passage could be interpreted as an apologia for the Silent Generation 's chill neutralities . But George Orwell-another Third Journalist-would have understood that her commitment is a virtuous aversion to political language " designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable , and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . " Like Orwell , Adler refuses the facile role of advocate or judge . In the trial of history she is simply a friend of the court . Luck and journalistic instinct informed her of tendencies just before they became movements . She was with Martin Luther King in Selma and Stokely Carmichael in Mississippi . She was in Israel during the Six-Day War , and in Chicago for an initial New Left conference . <P> Each account in this collection of 14 previously published pieces is fused with a quiet irony , as when she observes that whatever the rhetoric of the black militants , white supremacy has yet to see its first martyr . Her criticism is no less saline . Neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same after this Adlerian analysis : Sartre " allows Genet only the leap of accepting his destiny , of willing what is in fact the case . And to will what is the case is the essence of a staid Conservative position , so that Genet , when Sartre gets through with him , is not a rebel but a bureaucrat , doing the job Fate has assigned him .
