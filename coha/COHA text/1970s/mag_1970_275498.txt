It was supposed to be a quiet rally of Mexican Americans against the war in Viet Nam , but it ended in violence and tragedy . Shortly after noon , some 7,000 Chicanos started marching along Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles to Laguna Park , where the rally was to climax . But so many people jammed into a liquor store next to the park that soon the harassed clerks were unable to wait on them ; some of the customers walked out without paying for their bottles . When sheriff 's deputies began arresting the casual looters , rocks and bottles were tossed , and the riot was on . <P> Looting and burning spread over a 20-block area along the boulevard , a main thoroughfare in the barrio where many of Los Angeles ' 1,000,000 Mexican Americans live . Tear-gas grenades popped with bursts of eye-searing smoke . <P> <P> TIME Los Angeles Bureau Chief Don Neff reported : " At places , the four-lane street looked like a battleground , grotesquely littered with the limbless torsos of clothing-store mannequins , smoldering overstuffed chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutted by fire . Scores of shops and businesses had their windows smashed and their shelves cleaned out of merchandise . " <P> Relative calm descended with darkness , but tension remained . Some 1,200 sheriff 's deputies were summoned to the area . Burglar alarms echoed into the night , and red-lighted sheriff 's cruisers prowled the boulevard , while small knots of angry Mexican Americans gathered along barricades set up at the side streets . More than 70 people were arrested . At least 26 demonstrators and 26 deputies were injured ; one man was seriously hurt when he was shot in the head as he tried to drive through a blockade and crashed into a utility pole . <P> In the Silver Dollar Bar on Whittier Boulevard , deputies found the body of Ruben Salazar , 42 , a militant Mexican-American journalist well known in the Chicano community . Salazar , for years a reporter for the Los Angeles Times , joined the Chicano-oriented television station KMEX earlier this year and continued writing a weekly Times column that often bitterly attacked racism among white Angelenos . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman and interpreter to the Anglos . There is a notable new militancy among Chicanos , inspired by the successes of Cesar Chavez in organizing California 's farm workers . Salazar 's death , added to that growing hostile spirit , could touch off angry additional waves of Chicano unrest in the East Los Angeles barrio .
