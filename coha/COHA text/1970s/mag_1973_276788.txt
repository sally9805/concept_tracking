Darting first one way , then the other , a headless eel was loose in the Middle East last week . So some Japanese described the skyjacked J.A.L. 747 as it flew east from Amsterdam to Dubai , then west again to Damascus , and finally to its last landing in Libya in an eerily aimless 87-hour journey that endangered the lives of all aboard and caused Israel to go on military alert . Fearing that the jumbo jet might be used in a kamikaze attack on one of their cities , the Israelis were prepared , if it came too close , to black out their entire country or even shoot the plane down . <P> If the skyjackers had been on a definite mission , they had not expressed their goal clearly , and they certainly had not accomplished it . All they had to show for their efforts was a dead female fellow conspirator , accidentally killed by her own hand grenade at the start of the skyjacking and an obliterated $29 million airplane . " It was the most hopelessly baffling case , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer as much as $5,000,000 in ransom . " From start to finish we never knew what they wanted . Money we were prepared to pay and political asylum too . We 're still in the dark . " <P> The 22-member crew and the 118 passengers were just as baffled . Shortly after taking off from Amsterdam en route to Tokyo , the plane was seized by the four surviving terrorists-one Japanese and three Arabs-identifying themselves as " Sons of the Occupied Territory . " They forced Captain Kenji Konuma to land at Dubai , one of the seven tiny states in the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf . <P> While his troops surrounded the plane , Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktum , 26 , Defense Minister of the Emirates , tried to talk the skyjackers into letting the passengers go . He asked them to name a price , but they refused to discuss money . Were they interested in exchanging the passengers for some political prisoner ? the Defense Minister asked . " It was strange , very strange , " mused Maktum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , lunch and dinner . " Their only explanation : " We are awaiting instructions from our headquarters . " <P> Apparently , a message never came . What did arrive , curiously , was a telegram from West Germany : IF YOU INTEND TO KILL ALL PASSENGERS ABOARD , DO IT AT ONCE . OTHERWISE , BE HUMANE ENOUGH TO RELEASE THEM . IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS FOR YOU TO PERMIT THOSE WHOM YOU WANT TO KILL TO RECEIVE REFRESHMENTS AND MEALS . It was Signed : 13,569 INHABITANTS OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY . At first thought to be coded instructions to the skyjackers , the telegram proved to be a humanitarian plea from a group of concerned West Germans . However naive , the message may have had an effect . Almost 79 hours after landing in Dubai , the plane took off . " The skyjackers were even laughing and joking , " recalls Maktum.
