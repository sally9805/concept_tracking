By all accounts , Jimmy Carter knew there would be some hot reaction to his nomination of an old Georgia chum and political confidant , former Federal Judge Griffin Bell , as Attorney General . The transition team at the Justice Department had sent a memo to Plains warning of a storm of protests . They were right-and the storm went beyond black leaders ' upset about Bell 's mixed record on civil rights during his 14 years on the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals . Editorial outrage ran the political gamut . The New York Times 's James Reston blasted the nomination as " insensitive , willful , stubborn and even selfish . " The Wall Street Journal found it " all too reminiscent of the Kennedy-Nixon tradition of choosing an Attorney General . " <P> Bell , a Georgia country boy who made good , received his judgeship after helping to run John Kennedy 's campaign in Georgia in 1960 . By most reckonings , Bell 's record in civil rights cases was generally good , at least in Deep South terms . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; Bell has opposed court decisions calling for busing to achieve school desegregation . <P> &gt;He endorsed Richard Nixon 's abortive nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court . <P> &gt; He upheld the Georgia legislature 's 1966 refusal to seat black Activist Julian Bond because of Bond 's endorsement of an anti-Viet Nam War statement by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee . The majority opinion branded the SNCC statement " a call to action based on race ... It aligns the civil rights organization with ' colored people in such other countries as the Dominican Republic , the Congo , South America and Rhodesia . ' " <P> Bell did not help his cause-or Carter's-with his fumbling response to newsmen 's questions after his nomination . He insisted that when he endorsed Carswell , he was not aware that Carswell had once made a strongly pro-segregationist speech . Yet the speech was widely reported at the time , as he later conceded . He also waffled when questioned about his membership in two Atlanta clubs-the Capital City Club and the Piedmont Driving Club-that have not admitted blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit the clubs only after Carter had made it clear that he hoped Bell would do so . ( Budget Director-designate Bert Lance and Charles Kirbo , Carter 's closest political adviser , are also members of the Piedmont Club ; Houston Businessman Charles W. Duncan Jr. , tapped as Deputy Defense Secretary , is a member of Piedmont , as well as two similarly discriminatory clubs in Houston . ) <P> Bell 's record contains several pluses . His rulings have been pro-civil rights in employment practices and voting cases . In the 1960s , Bell was a pioneer in urging that Southern courts call more blacks for jury duty ( " If you do n't get any Negroes on the jury panel , the system is wrong " ) . <P> Although Carter gave the impression that he was considering several candidates for Justice , it has become clear that Bell was Jimmy 's man from the start " because he feels comfortable with him . " Aides say , although Carter anticipated some negative reaction , he may have been surprised by the uproar.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
