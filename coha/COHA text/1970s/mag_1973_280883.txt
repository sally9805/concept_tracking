Professional drag racing does n't offer much in the way of fringe benefits or job security , but at least the hourly pay is difficult to beat . Last year , for exactly 46 minutes of racing , Bill ( " Grumpy " ) Jenkins got $260,000 ( including $110,000 for commercial endorsements ) . Barring an accident , his wage rate this year - roughly $5,650 a minute-will be about the same . <P> A small ( 5 ft. 4 in. ) , balding troll of a man with a porcupine persona , Jenkins , 42 , dominates a sport usually associated with big bruisers in black leather . Last year he won ten of the eleven major national drag races in the pro-stock class . At the American Hot Rod Association meet in St. Louis two months ago , he thundered down the quarter-mile strip in 8.97 sec. , an all-time record . Ten days later in Epping , N.H. , he clocked 8.93 sec . He only placed second last week at the N.H.R.A. world-championship meet in Amarillo , Texas , but Jenkins is still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither the pursuit of records nor the fact that he is the most successful driver in the 22-year his tory of organized drag racing seems to elate him . " It 's really a business , " Jenkins snarls from behind his cigar . " I enjoy the development work on the cars as much as the actual racing . " <P> Once a semilicit pastime for thrill-seeking high school kids , drag racing has become big business since 1951 , when Wally Parks , a former racing driver , founded the N.H.R.A. and held its first meet on an abandoned airstrip in Madera , Calif . Last year the organization sanctioned 2,930 races at 150 tracks , drawing more than 4,000,000 paying spectators . <P> To the uninitiated , drag racing may be easily confused with the rival sport of stock-car racing . In both , the cars sometimes bear a superficial resemblance . But in stocks , the autos career around oval tracks for as many as 500 miles before crossing the finish line ; dragsters hurtle down a 1,320-ft. asphalt strip under the watchful electronic eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but drivers are out to beat the clock as much as each other . <P> Acid Bath . Technological superiority is as important in drag racing as it is in the nuclear arms race . In fact , Bill Jenkins ' success results less from his skill as a driver ( " A monkey can drive one of these things down a straight track , " he says ) than from his knack as an engineer . A farm boy from Downingtown , Pa. , he dropped out of Cornell University 's engineering school in 1953 after his father died . He made his living for several years building engines and preparing race cars for competition , before deciding in 1965 to drive them himself in order to earn more money . <P> Jenkins ' 1973 Chevrolet Vega does not look much different from the one that Mom drives to the supermarket , except for the hood-mounted air scoop and an outrigger in back to keep the front of the car from rising too high on takeoff . But Jenkins and his crew of six mechanics make sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ordeals , the team marinates its body in an acid bath to eat away 120 Ibs. of excess weight . The hood and rear deck are replaced with lightweight Fiberglas panels . His $70,000 engine produces nearly 650 h.p. against a normal 150 h.p.
