THE CONDOR PASSES by Shirley Ann Grau. 421 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> Novels resembling The Godfather are to be expected these days , but it is certainly a surprise to see one from Shirley Ann Grau . <P> This one starts out by recounting the rapacious career of one Thomas Oliver , who was born in an Ohio River town in 1870 . At 13 he left home , and by 17 he was prospering as a pickpocket , pimp and smuggler . After another ten years of wandering , he winds up down the river in New Orleans . His first big money comes from running whorehouses , though the early jazz-band accompaniments nearly drive his tin ears crazy . Prohibition bootlegging eventually accounts for his real power and fortune . While it must be said that Oliver is not Italian , his partners are called Manzini and Lamotta , and he marries into a thriving Sicilian clan . Gradually , all the standard gangland props are assembled : henchmen , reprisals , shootouts at the warehouse , payoffs and protection rackets .

Indeed , when his wife dies , leaving only two daughters , Oliver " adopts " a handsome young Cajun named Robert Caillet , cuts him in on the business , and literally railroads him into marriage with his older daughter Anna . <P> By this time the Old Man has been transmogrified into a wise and mellow padrone , and the story shifts a generation . Daughter Anna inherits her mother s masochism ; her sister Margaret gets her father 's greed . As for Robert , he drinks , chases women and wonders what the Old Man ever saw in him . The reader can only agree . <P> Even Shirley Ann Grau 's best novel , The Hard Blue Sky , is very casually plotted . But she can write with a poet 's concentration and record dialect knowingly . Perhaps The Condor Passes is merely an attempt to join the mainstream-as the South is now supposed to be doing-and to market all that distilled violence nationally . Still , there is richer life in the bayous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will soon be back in her old pirogue . <P> Martha Duffy
