txt Watch that little square on your paycheck stub that tells how much was deducted for social security . It will remain demurely close in 1980 to what it was this year ? going up just $174.90 , or $14.575 a month . But brace yourself ? and your budget ? as Jan. 1 , 1981 , approaches . For , from that day on , take-home pay will shrink as working Americans , and their employers , pay sharply higher taxes to provide benefits for a growing number of older Americans , dependent partly or wholly on their monthly social-security checks . Workers at all income levels will feel the shock , for the maximum payroll tax will soar to $1,975.05 ( compared with $1,403.77 this year and $1,587.67 in 1980 ) under current law . Put another way , a worker at the maximum tax rate will transfer $571.28 more of his money to help support elderly and disabled Americans than he does this year . The social and political impact of this could be explosive , at a time when the skyrocketing costs of gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whittle away at a family 's disposable income . If both husband and wife work , the blow will be double , since each partner pays a separate payroll tax . . Beyond purely economic issues , social security provides an inestimable service to elderly Americans , lifting millions of older citizens above the poverty line and enabling them to cope with inflation better . Without social security , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , 60 percent of families headed by people 65 or older would be poor , by government definition . With social security and allied government programs , the proportion of elderly below the poverty line falls to 14 percent . // From page 1 Relax  - -  -  still 377 days Looked at another way , working Americans pay impersonally into a system designed to help all older citizens , rather than having directly to support their own elderly . The nub of the problem , as analysts see it , is that outlays are growing faster than income . The proportion of recipients increases , while the proportion of workers contributing to the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-security benefits are indexed to inflation . As the cost-of-living increases , so do payments to nearly 35 million Americans . Last July benefits rose 9.9 percent under the inflation formula . In 1978 the increase was 6.5 percent ; it was 5.9 percent in 1977 , 6.4 percent the year before , and 8 percent in 1975 . If future financing problems are apparent , a solution is not . Both Rep. Al Ullman ( D ) of Oregon , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , and Rep. J. J. Pickle ( D ) of Texas , chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee , expect to hold hearings on reform of the syst  --  m sometime next year . This reflects a growing consensus in Congress , shared by some of President Carter 's economic advisers , that somehow the 1981 payroll tax burden must be lightened . ? One proposal is to finance part of social security out of general tax revenues , ? perhaps medicare , medicaid , and disability insurance , now financed by the payroll tax . Here public opinion must be addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not welfare ? earned . by their own years of contributions . Almost no one proposes financing old-age insurance benefits ? the green checks that are the heart and soul of social security ? out of general revenues . What might be done , some experts argue , is to pay for those parts of the system that most resemble welfare , ? because their benefits are not tied to earnings ? out of general tax revenues . This would relieve financial pressure on social security and allow the-payroll tax to be rolled back or at least increased more slowly , while still assuring health and disability benefits to recipients . In part , this problem may be solved , if and - when Congress passes a national health insurance program into law . Another proposal would raise the age of eligibility for old-age payments from 65 to 70 years . Reducing benefits for disabled workers also is suggested
