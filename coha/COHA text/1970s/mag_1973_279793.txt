THERE are those who say that law and order are just code words for repression and bigotry . That is dangerous nonsense . Law and order are code words for goodness and decency in America . " So spoke President Nixon as he explained his new crime initiatives . It was a purely Nixonian sentiment , grounded on his belief that he and the majority of Americans were resonating to the same moral pitch . <P> Nixon is not alone in that belief . New York 's Nelson Rockefeller is urging his state to adopt mandatory life sentences without parole for any convicted adult drug pusher . In many cities , police are riding a renewed crest of respect ; New York and Los Angeles each have two ex-policemen campaigning to join Philadelphia 's Frank Rizzo as tough mayors with a no-nonsense attitude that was forged in a blue uniform . At least four state legislatures have reauthorized the death penalty and half the remaining states are considering similar legislation . The President was very much participating in a trend . With a passing swipe at " permissive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Supreme Court concern for criminal defendants is all but a bad memory . <P> Clearly , Nixon felt no embarrassment about the harshness of his program . Still , he might have been embarrassed by his own rhetoric . To say that " Americans in the last decade were often told that the criminal was not responsible for his crimes . . . but that society was responsible " is a gross oversimplification of the view that true crime control requires dealing with root causes . And when he refers to " our returning prisoners of war " as examples of the sort of " tough moral fiber " that will help bring about a nation that is " free from crime , " he is guilty of both irrelevance and exaggeration . <P> If the President 's words are loose , however , his proposals are quite precise . And he gave his highest priority to two of the most controversial-stiffer sentencing and the death penalty . They raise complex questions . Will tougher sentences reduce crime ? One hint of a negative answer may lie in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any industrialized nation in the world , while also being one of the most crime-ridden . A more direct rebuttal came last week from the Fortune Society , a New York-based self-help group of former convicts . Distressed that politicians never ask ex-cons " about what deterred us and what did not , " the society 's monthly newsletter reported that " those of us who were small-time pushers , thieves , stickup artists , recall that we were too busy fighting to survive on the streets to be deterred by legislation . When we were committing crimes , we did not think about getting caught . " <P> Stanford Law Professor John Kaplan comes to a similar conclusion about lengthier sentences , but for quite different reasons . " In large areas of the U.S. , there is no substantial cause for criminals to fear the criminal law , " Kaplan says . " The reason is that government is not willing to pay the money it would take to really get tough . " That is , authorities are not willing to build and staff the necessary new courthouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion federal anti-crime budget , for instance , is earmarked for court or penal purposes .
