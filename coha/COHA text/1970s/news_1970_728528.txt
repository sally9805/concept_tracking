txt Until a month ago , Brenda Layne was leading the usual life of a young mother : Cooking , cleaning and , if she had a minute to spare , visiting with neighbors . " Frankly , " she says , " I was climbing the walls . " Now the 24-year-old Mrs. Layne is back at work for the first time m three years , earning 85.000 a year in the accounting section of Avco Corp . ' s printing division here . She is happy with her job ? " I 'm not doing this so much for the financial benefits as to have something stimulating to do "  --  and Avco is pleased with her work . Prior to her marriage in 1967 , Mrs. Layne had worked as a clerk in the data-processing section of a large bank . Her decision to seek a job at the Avco plant was n't by chance , however . For one thing , her husband is a supervisor in one of the printing operations there . Even more important , Avco has been operating a day-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . About 50 children ? of whom Mrs. Layne 's 19-month-old son , Oscar , is the youngest  --  are enrolled . A third of them are children of Avco employes : the rest come from the surrounding neighborhood , a predominantly black area in the south part of Boston . The fee is only $15 a week . Right Down the Hall If the day-care center had n't existed , Mrs. Layne doubts she would have been able to return to work . " The regular baby-sitting services are too unreliable , " she says . " Besides , the Avco center provides medical services and trained teachers and supervisors . And if Oscar needs me , I 'm right down the hall . " The Avco day-care center is viewed  --  along mith a similar pioneering project at a KLH stereo assembly plant in nearby Cambridge ? as the possible forerunner of an important new fringe benefit . Only a handful of other companies , principally Southern textile mills , operate daycare centers at present , but scores of companies are known to be either on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These include American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , Polaroid Corp. , John Hancock Life Insurance Co. and Zale Corp. , the Dallas-based jewelry concern . A recent conference on the subject in Chicago sponsored by Urban Research Corp . drew observers from such companies as Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. and Smith Kline &; French Laboratories , the drug maker . Besides centers set up by companies to care for their own employes ' offspring , a number of firms plan to franchise day-care centers open to all . Among them are Hasbro Industries Inc. , a big toy and school supply concern based in Pawtucket . R.I. , and American Child Centers Inc. , a subsidiary of Performance Systems Inc. of Nashville . Administration Backing Day-care programs run by public agencies are also expanding . The Federal Government now provides full or partial financing for daycare facilities for more than 600,000 children under various welfare and antipoverty programs , and approval of an Administrationbacked bill now before Congress would add 150,000 more preschoolers to this total . The bill dovetails with Administration welfare reform proposals that place heavy emphasis on making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady employment . The current surge of interest in day care reflects a number of pressures . Foremost is the rapid rise in the number of working mothers . In 1969 there were 4.2 million-working mothers with preschool children , up from 2.9 million in 1960 , according to estimates by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare 's Child Development Bureau . Moreover , it 's estimated that the proportion of working mothers with children living at home will rise to 605 , to 70% during the 1970s , compared with 42% in 1960 and only 10% in 1940 . " Many women with children are coming to view having a job as a right , not something that 's nice if it can be arranged , " says an Urban Research staffer . " Women want to pursue careers just as much as men , Why should they be chained to the home by children ? " Dramatizing a Demand The feminist movement agrees wholeheartedly with that assessment . Recently , militant women employes at the Ladies Home Journal held sit-ins at the magazine 's New York offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities for advancement . Among their demands was one that the magazine establish a day-care center so that female employes would n't be forced to choose between careers and children . The Ladies Home Journal says it is looking into the matter . One problem : An on-premise day-care center would require many mothers to commute long distances with their children . The day-care idea is n't new . Some European nations , including Russia and the Scandinavian countries , for decades have offered working mothers places to drop off small children . In the U.S. , New York City set up public day-care centers in the late 1930s , and during World War II some companies offered child care so women could work on assembly lines . Two of the most extensive wartime company-run daycare operations were set up at the Portland shipbuilding facilities of Henry J. Kaiser Co. , a predecessor of Kaiser Industries Corp . At their peak in 1944 , the Kaiser child-care centers enrolled more than 800 children , many of them as young as 18 months , and were open around the clock . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10 nurses and several nutritionists . The children received breakfast and lunch , and if the mother wished , she could pick up a take-home dinner from the center kitchens when she called for her child at the end of a shift The cost was $5 a week for the first child and $3 75 a week for each additional child . Day-care experts warn that facilities are not easy to set up or cheap to operate . " There is some fairly unrealistic thinking going on , particularly among some of the franchisers , " asserts Gwen Morgan , a child-rare expert who was heavily involved in the KLH pt ( ) pet and now is a consultant on the subject to the state of Massachusetts . " Many day-care operators think they can pay the staff low wirge , : , because most state- , only require the director of a day-cai e center to have full credentials in the field of early childhood development , " says Mrs. Morgan " But as the industry grows , there will he a lot of pressure for parity with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . " Last fall day-care employes , in New York struck for several weeks and won a 23 ' ; salary hike this year to be followed by a 13 ' , boost next year . And Mrs. Morgan notes that mother s are usually reluctant to place their children in new and unproven child care centers . In many cases their caution may be justified Under certain circumstances , separating children under five from the home environment at an early age can be psychologically damaging . " Children need a lot of care and attention at that age , " says Mrs. Morgan . " If they are just allowed to sit around without adequate supervision , they may not develop properly . " Strong Demand Generally speaking , however , children are n't harmed by being placed in clay-care facilities , Mrs. Morgan and others say . Staying at home may prove even more of a danger in many cases , particularly when it pies tints the family from earning a dec ent living . " The important thing is how the child pereCIN es what is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If his placement in a day-care facility is n't viewed as a form of rejec lion or punishment , then he can accept it much as older children accept school . " Demand is unquestionably heavy at established facilities . New York City , whose daycare system is considered the most advanced m the country , has 118 centers serving about 5,000 children . There are 7,000 children on waiting lists . " And every time we open a new center , especially in a new neighborhood , it just seems to stimulate demand that much more , " says Muriel Katz , director of the program . Most of New York 's public day-care facilities are operated by voluntary groups . Priority in enrollment is given to welfare families where the mother wishes to enter a job training program or find a job Fees , which are on a sliding scale from $25.50 a week to S2 a week , cover only a part of expenses . City officials figure the average cost per child is about .550 a week . The cost of day care is considerably less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a pilot center near the home office in Nashville ** a profit even though the weekly fee is only $21.75 , including lunch . The concern plans to franchise its center 's in upper-income apartment complexes , among other locations , and figures that operators should be able to realize profit margins of up to 20 ' Aid to Recruiting Industrial concerns considering day-care centers hope the facilities will boost job applications from qualified women and reduce absenteeism . Mrs. Nettie Williams , a KLH employe with two children in the child-care center there . figures she used to miss three or- four weeks of work a year when she was using babysitters . " Most of the time , the sitters would n't let you know until the last minute if they were n't going to show up , " she says . " By then , it was usually too late to make other arrangements . " Mrs. Williams also has a son in the first grade who attended the KLH center last year , and she attributes his academic success to the day-care program of fundamental educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , " she says , " and they are thinking about letting him skip a grade . " Mrs. Williams , who works in the quality control section of a KLH stereo assembly operation , earns $272 a week . She pays $18 a week in day-care fees for her two younger children . The KLH center has had its problems , however . Opened in July 1967 , it reached the break-even point in enrollment about a year later ? at which point KLH began a series of layoffs that eventually cut the work force in half . The result was a drastic falloff in enrollment . The center was set up to care for 60 children , but at one point enrollment dipped to 20 . Now it 's up to 51 , but only because the center Mopped limiting enrollment to employes ' children and began accepting youngsters of welfare mother 's and others in the community .
