The coronary bypass is unquestionably the most frequently performed piece of radical major surgery in the U.S. Some 25,000 times a year , doctors open the chest of a heart-disease victim to implant a piece of one of the patient 's own veins or arteries to carry blood around an obstruction in the coronary artery that feeds the heart muscle . But is the bypass operation always necessary ? Not according to Dr. Henry Russek , a professor of cardiology at New York Medical College . At a conference on cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston last week , Russek claimed that drugs and other forms of medical care are far better treatment than surgery for most cases of angina pectoris , the pains arising from the oxygen-starved heart muscle that can be forerunners of heart attacks . Said he : " More lives have been lost through bypass surgery than have been saved by it . " <P> Russek 's remarks touched a raw nerve among the surgeons attending the meeting . Boosters of the bypass operation credit it with saving at least 60,000 lives-most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to heart-disease victims who might otherwise become cardiac cripples . The operation is now being performed at some 600 U.S. hospitals , and many surgeons believe that it should be used even more frequently . <P> Unlike numerous cardiologists who scorn surgery , Russek acknowledges the value of the coronary bypass in some cases . But he questions whether the operation is as safe as its advocates claim . <P> He notes that patients treated in one big-city institution have a 66% chance of dying on the operating table , ending up with a nonfunctioning graft or suffering major nonfatal postoperative complications . There are risks even at some of the university hospitals offering the operation . Though operating room mortality may be less than 5% , complications such as myocardial infarction ( the classic heart attack ) , brain damage , hemorrhage , kidney failure or closure of the bypass are not uncommon . Despite these risks , Russek noted the tendency of some doctors to perform the operation as a " preemptive procedure " on patients who have not yet experienced angina or who suffer only mild symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is the dearth of medical treatment preceding a decision to operate . Russek reviewed the medical treatment that had been given to 200 patients admitted to hospitals for surgery to correct uncontrollable angina . Nearly half had been treated with nothing other than nitroglycerin , a drug used to dilate or expand the arteries . In most of these cases , the drug had been used only to help abort an attack of angina-not to modify the conditions that led to the pain . On the other hand there had been insufficient effort to deal with either the physical conditions that cause angina pectoris or the life-style that eventually leads to it . " Taking medication , losing weight , giving up smoking and slowing down are unpleasant , " Russek explains . " Most people would rather submit to an operation that promises to cure them quickly , even at the risk of death , than put up with medical management . Yet even after surgery these patients still need this kind of care . " In fact , he suspects , some of the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the patient received before .
