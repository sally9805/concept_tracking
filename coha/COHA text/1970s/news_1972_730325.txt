txt Egyptian President Sadat 's removal of the majority of Soviet military personnel from his country suggests three possible alternatives , analysts here believe . All three seem capable of melting the frozen " no war , no peace " situation in the Middle East , which many observers here thought would remain unchanged until after next November 's U.S. presidential elections . ? The first possibility is that Mr. Sadat is preparing for war with Israel , or at least a limited military operation against Israeli forces in Egypt 's occupied Sinai Peninsula . Earlier hints of disfavor President Sadat and other Egyptian leaders have often hinted the Soviets disapproved of this ? and indeed prevented it . Ammunition and fuel were kept on short supply . Spare parts were hard to get . Egypt 's 1969 and 1970 guerrilla forays behind Israeli lines in Sinai were labeled " amateurish " and " adventurous " by the Russians . // *Key Mideast question : Cairo 's next move // But this first possibility would suggest Mr. Sadat had found other major foreign sources of arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely . President Pompidou 's government , despite its eagerness to promote arms sales , and its deliveries of warplanes to Egypt 's ally Libya , has pledged an arms embargo on " frontline Mideast states ? Israel , Egypt , Jordan , and Syria . " ? The second possibility is that the pressure of anti-Soviet elements in Egypt and the hone of an honorable peaceful settlement with Israel arranged through the United States combined to move Mr. Sadat . Cairo may think it has received , or has actually received , American assurances of some kind of revival of the defunct 1969 peace plan of U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers , in this view . Word to Washington Advocates of this theory argue that Mr. Sadat can now in effect tell Washington : " We did everything you asked , including offering to sign a peace treaty with Israel . But you were unable or unwilling to deliver Israel 's part of the bargain ? withdrawal from territory conquered in 1967 as called for by the UN resolution you say you back . " Now we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , too . You can no longer convincingly argue that in Egypt there is a ' Russian threat ' against yourselves or against Israel . " Your massive arms aid to Israel is no longer justifiable , even by your criteria . You should now help us get the peace settlement you and the Russians both say you want , without listening to the Israeli arguments about theirs being the main defense line for ' democracy ' in the Middle East . " ? The third possibility being weighed here is the Mr. Sadat acted simply to regain the freedom of action between the two superpowers which the late President Nasser once had , without any definite plan for war or peace in view . Moscow 's failure to live , up to what Mr. Sadat regarded as Moscow 's part of the bargain of Soviet-Egyptian cooperation , by supplying arms Egypt wanted , would in this view make continuing this cooperation counterproductive for Egypt . Mr. Sadat would thus regain his liberty by following the advice of prominent anti-Soviet Egyptians given in a note to him last April 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two superpowers " and , by so doing , reopen Egypt 's formerly closed options .
