At his press conference last week , Gerald Ford reaffirmed his " strong support " for Vice President-designate Nelson Rockefeller . But later , when asked whether he would still nominate Rockefeller if he had it to do over , Ford replied uncertainly : " I think I would . " <P> The President 's hesitation may have derived from the sheer bulk of the information concerning Rockefeller 's private business dealings rather than from any specific sense of wrongdoing . Last week the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Rules Committee began to wend their way through 2,300 pages of FBI reports on Rockefeller 's past . At the same time , Rockefeller released details of $507,656 in loans that he has made over the past 17 years to friends , associates and members of his family-all in addition to the $2 million in previously disclosed gifts . <P> The new material seemed interesting chiefly for what it revealed about the thoroughness of the Rockefeller bookkeeping . It showed , for instance , that Rockefeller had made a $15,000 loan to his wife Happy in October 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain Purchase . The potentially most troublesome of the transactions involved loans totaling $84,000 in January and April 1957 to Robert B. Anderson , the former Navy Secretary , who at the time was a private businessman . Rockefeller loaned the money to Anderson to buy stock in the International Basic Economy Corp. , a Rockefeller-controlled company with large investments in Latin America . According to Anderson , he sold the IBEC stock back to Rockefeller on June 6 , 1957 , at the price he had paid for it , after President Eisenhower had picked Anderson to become Secretary of the Treasury . Said Anderson last week : " It was just a plain stock purchase . " However , congressional investigators are also looking into more complicated business dealings involving the two men that year . <P> Prolongation of the controversy has cost Rockefeller some support in both the Congress and the nation at large-and has delayed unconscionably the vital task of arranging the succession . Most members of the Senate Rules and House Judiciary committees seemed to agree last week that they had found no disclosures sufficiently serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearings could easily drag on until January , by which time Rockefeller would face the new , and perhaps more hostile , Congress .
