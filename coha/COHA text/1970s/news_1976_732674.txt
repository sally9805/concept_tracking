txt President Ford now has visible momentum ? and it seems bound to lift his prospects for closing the gap with Democrat Jimmy Carter . And Mr. Ford also comes away from this town on the edge of the Great Plains with a running mate who is a hard-working , hard-hitting campaigner and who should help the President in the race to catch up with the Carter-Mondale ticket . Sen. Robert J. Dole is known as a thorough , professional politician , completely loyal to his party . He is sufficiently conservative to be acceptable to most Reaganites . And he is viewed as sufficiently flexible in dealing with issues to be acceptable to most party moderates . Mr. Dole 's " philosophy and mine coincide almost identically , " Mr. Ford said in introducing his choice of running mate . More than anything else , Mr. Dole , a Kansan , will help Mr. Ford where the primaries have shown he has troubles with the voters ? in the agricultural belt of the Midwest .

But the President also comes away scarred by the highly effective Reagan challenge . Item ? His effectiveness and strength as a leader were put into question by Mr. Reagan 's many primary victories , most of them coming in the later stages during the 30-primary period that extended from February into June .

This was reflected in the polls which showed Mr. Carter first behind Mr. Ford , then getting out in front , and then lengthening his lead to about 2 to 1 . Item ? Further , Mr. Reagan moved the President to the right ideologically ? causing him to shape harder lines on both foreign and domestic policy . This is reflected in the platform , where the President accepted just about everything Mr. Reagan wanted . But it may well handicap Mr. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats who might be wooed by a GOP moderate , but not by a GOP conservative whose position bears much of the Reagan brand . // From page 1 *Dole choice But the convention was a huge qualified success for the President as he turns now to the task of cutting away at the Carter lead . ? The U.S. public was fascinated by the goings  --  on here . The tide of battle held the viewers ' interest , keeping them at their TV sets even through some of the dull speeches .

Further , there seemed to be ample evidence here that the party was coming together ( some of the Reaganites a little reluctantly , of course ) behind the Ford-Dole team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are saying ( a ) that while they preferred Mr. Reagan , they really have nothing against the President , and ( b ) that they ? will back Mr. Ford because their principal concern is that Jimmy Carter be denied the presidency .
