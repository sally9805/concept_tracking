Reporter Godfrey Sperling : " Do you plan to have a code of ethics for the Executive Branch ? " <P> President Gerald Ford : " The code of ethics that will be followed will be the example that I set . " <P> In that extraordinary exchange-unthinkable at a presidential press conference in preWatergate days-Gerald Ford last week effectively summed up the homespun precepts that will guide his Administration . " I will be as candid and as forthright as I possibly can , " he promised . " I will expect any individuals in my Administration to be exactly the same . There will be no tightly controlled operation of the White House staff . " He firmly added : " I will make the decisions and take the blame for them or whatever benefit might be the case . " <P> The declaration of principle came midway through the third full week of the Ford presidency , a week in which he turned from healing the wounds of Watergate to dealing with the nation 's bread-and-butter problems . Almost daily , Ford met with members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic ills ( see cover story page 22 ) and to review plans for the two-day economic summit conference of businessmen , labor leaders and economists that will take place later this month . <P> He also took steps to cement U.S. ties abroad . Press Secretary J.F. terHorst said that Ford has accepted an invitation to visit Rumania , probably some time after his trip to Japan in late fall . <P> President Giovanni Leone of Italy will make a state visit to Washington on Sept. 25 , and Communist Party Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland will visit for two days in early October . This week the U.S. and East Germany are due to establish diplomatic relations . <P> No Resemblance . Ford 's press conference was his first as President but the 56th that he has held since Dec. 6 , when he was inaugurated as Vice President . It took place in the White House 's East Room , which was jammed with newsmen , just as it had been for his predecessor 's infrequent sessions with reporters-37 in 5 years as President . But there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underscore the informal tone that he has set for his presidency , Ford dispensed with Nixon 's trappings-a stagey backdrop of blue velvet draperies and a massive , bulletproof lectern . Instead , Ford stood before a door that was symbolically left open and used a narrow , hourglass-shaped stand . He wore no makeup ; despite the bright lights for the television cameras , he did not perspire . He seemed relaxed and self-assured-in part perhaps because he had carefully gone over the issues with five key aides for two hours on Tuesday and for another hour the morning of the press conference . Still , he and his staff had not anticipated fully one-third of the reporters ' questions . <P> Ford had no big news to announce ; the significance of the session lay in the re-establishment of regularly scheduled press conferences . In 29 minutes , Ford answered 27 questions , demonstrating his ability to field inquiries on a broad variety of foreign and domestic subjects-and his skill at gracefully evading those he did not wish to answer fully . <P> Highlights : <P> CLEMENCY FOR NIXON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
