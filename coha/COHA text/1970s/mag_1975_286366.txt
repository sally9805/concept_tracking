DOWN THE ANCIENT STAIRS <P> Directed by MAURO BOLOGNINI Screenplay by RAFFAELE ANDREASSI , MARIO AROSIO , TULLIO PINELLI and BERNARDINO ZAPPONI <P> Madness on the inside , madness on the outside . In a mental hospital in Tuscany , Dr. Bonaccorsisi ( Marcello Mastroianni ) takes the insanity that rages all around him pretty much in his elegant stride . At times he takes advantage of it too . Pathology has a liberating effect on his libido . He flirts with patients and sleeps with three of the women he sees in the course of work : <P> Donna Francesca ( Lucia Bose ) , the wife of the hospital director ; Bianca ( Marthe Keller ) , a nurse ; and Carla ( Barbara Bouchet ) , who is married to a member of Bonaccorsisi 's staff . Other , lesser men may thirst for a glimpse of the world out side , but the asylum is sufficient for the doctor , who spends his time between rounds and beddings in the laboratory trying to isolate " the germ of schizophrenia . " It is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greater Madness . It takes his new assistant , Dr. Anna Bersani ( Franoise Fabian ) , just a little while to realize this . <P> Dr. Bersani is a Freudian , and Bonaccorsisi denounces her for her " new ideas . " Shortly thereafter , he makes a pass , which is firmly rejected . The doctor goes back to his microscope and believes he has discovered the deadly schizo germ . His future seems assured until Dr. Bersani looks at his slides and tells him the germ is just a drop of faulty solvent . This precipitates a crisis : Bonaccorsisi finally wonders if he is going mad . <P> Down the Ancient Stairs could have used more crises . The movie tips its hand instantly . Time ( 1930 ) and place ( a mad house in Italy ) add up to two inevitable points : there is no escaping insanity , and Fascism outside the walls is a greater madness than anything the asylum contains . After The Conformist , after R.D. <P> Laing , the idea is grindingly obvious - except , of course , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity quite seriously enough and so makes them somehow less threatening . The actors , adrift , are proficient , especially Franoise Fabian , who is beautiful and intelligent as usu al . She could not have been committed to this movie voluntarily .
