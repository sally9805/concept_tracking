THE Black September terrorists take their name from the month two years ago when Jordan 's King Hussein opened his campaign to crush the Palestinian guerrillas in his country . The group is the latest and most vicious twist in the tortured search by the Palestinians for some means of revenge against Israel . At the same time , Black September , or Ailul al Aswad in Arabic , attests to the fact that ordinary guerrilla warfare against Israel , once touted as the hope of the Arabs , has been an abject failure . <P> That failure was starkly evident to guerrilla leaders who met last week in Damascus . Israel , by expert policing and harsh retaliation , has virtually sealed its borders against them and forced its neighbors to bring the guerrillas under control . The fedayeen are powerless in Jordan , kept on a tight rein in Syria , and restricted in Lebanon . The result is that they have been reduced to occasional random terrorism that is ruthless but scarcely effective in either overthrowing Arab leaders opposed to them or restoring Palestine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about investing in nightclubs and laundries as a hedge against the time when contributions may dry up ( Saudi Arabia has not paid the organization anything in seven months ) . <P> In these circumstances , the bitterest and most extreme of the fedayeen have turned to Black September . It surfaced for the first time last November in Cairo , where four terrorists boldly assassinated Jordanian Premier Wasfi Tell as he entered the Cairo-Sheraton Hotel . Tell was a pro-Western Arab interested in negotiating with Israel ; his killers are out of jail on bail awaiting a trial that has yet to be scheduled . Since that time , Black September teams have also murdered five Jordanians living in West Germany whom they suspected of spying for Israel ; attempted to assassinate Jordan 's ambassador to London ; and set off damaging explosions in a Hamburg plant making electronic components for sale to Israel , and a Trieste refinery whose crime apparently was processing oil for " pro-Zionist interests " in Germany and Austria .

By pinning the blame on Al Fatah , of course , the Israelis may merely be providing themselves with a visible target for retaliation . But as they detail the structure , the organization consists of 400 to 600 members-U.S. sources put the figure closer to 100-who plan operations , then recruit rank-and-file members of Al Fatah to carry them out . According to the Israelis , the organization is headquartered in Beirut and commanded by one Mohammed Yusif Najjar , otherwise known as Abu Yusuf , who is a former top intelligence officer of Al Fatah . The Israelis claim that it is divided into four main units that are variously responsible for Europe , the Middle East , Africa and the Americas-where Black September has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
