 | RAIN MADE TO ORDER @# @# The Everglades were burning last May . Freshwater wells were beginning to turn salty , and Miami 's WFUN was recommending that listeners take showers instead of baths to conserve water . Florida was experiencing its worst drought in history ? and 20,000 feet above the ravaged Everglades in a DC-6 , I ? with a dozen scientists ? was trying to make it rain . Actually , I was along just for the ride , and to see if , after a quarter century of trying , meteorologists have really learned how to make large amounts of rainfall . We had been flying , on and off , for a week . Other days @#  | @# had brought a little success , but nothing spectacular . Today , though , things looked superb . Bill Woodley , director of the project , said over the intercom , " Just look at those cells building in the east . " " They 're beautiful , " agreed Dr. Joanne Simpson , who runs the Miamibased Experimental Meteorological Laboratory of NOAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first woman in the U.S. to receive a Ph.D . in meteorology . Their Florida cloud-seeding operation is one of the first projects the federal government has sponsored that is something more than pure research . But there are other rainmaking teams scattered across the country . In the west , such utilities as Montana Power and Light , Washington Water and Power , Utah Power and Light , and California-Oregon Power all are attempting to wring out the clouds . On the federal level , rainmaking studies have been attempted by the Forest Service , NASA , FAA , National Science Foundation , and Defense Department . Probably the most extensive effort is the program of the Department of Interior 's Bureau of Reclamation . Its Project Skywater has been running since 1962 , and weather-modification experiments are taking place in nearly a dozen western states . And experiments prove that with proper conditions rainmaking works . Chasing clouds . Now , at 200 mph , wing-tip seedpods ready , we were looking for a little more of that proof in the form of a potential thunderhead . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Over the phones Simpson and Woodley talked clouds . Technicians monitored equipment . Tape machines and visacorders recorded airspeed , wind speed and directions , liquid-water content of the air ; dewpoint , static and dynamic pressures . and temperatures . Movie cameras clicked cloud pictures from the nose and sides ? one every five seconds . Later these would be viewed to see a speeded version , five hours ' worth in 10 minutes . Other cameras filmed images of radar and flight-instrument readings , from takeoff to landing . Reports of cloud-condition data from the University of Miami 's radar lab , from weathermen , and from radiosondes ( balloon-carried instruments that measure humidity , temperature , and pressure ) were punched into a computer . Out came an opinion : Have at it . We were about to do just that . Off to our right Simpson was studying a bulbous white cloud . It was a good candidate : higher than most of its neighbors , fairly young ( the edges were " hard , " not feathery ) , somewhat darker than most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dr. Simpson . Woodley directed the pilot to enter it , and we banked tightly , headed for the cloud 's middle , as his voice came over the intercom : " Prepare for entry 10 seconds . " I watched the wing disappear in a swirl of white . The plane lurched sideways , pulled up sickeningly , and I saw the wing again ? flapping . Darkness closed in and drops formed on the window , then sped off horizontally . Hail crackled against the wing . We dropped and I grabbed for my camera . Got it . Not my coffee , though . Over my leg . Hot . The plane rattled as though something awful outside were shaking it . My stomach twisted . For a moment I thought the wing would fly off ? then I remembered that this old weatherbeaten DC-6 had flown more than 400 times into the eyes of 27 hurricanes . Woodley was on the intercom , his voice calm : " Temperature looks good . Mark cloud one , pass one . ' Bombs  | @# away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ... " on up to eight . He was pressing the seeding button at roughly 100-meter intervals , and ; had decided to mainly because of two readings before him : Water content was high , and the cloud was actively growing . He knew that , because the cloud temperature was higher than the surrounding air . For a cloud to rain , sufficient nuclei ? microscopic particles of dust ? are necessary for water vapor to coalesce into something heavy enough to fall . When too few dust bits are about . there is little rain . Man makes up for this lack by seeding with silver iodide , and the Miami team uses flares , electrically ignited , to distribute it . The flares fall some 12,000 feet , burning and releasing trillions of particles en route . In the early days of weather modification , most cloud seeders believed one artificial nucleus per liter of cloud air to be enough to cause rain ; they were probably right . Such a ratio more or less wrings out a cloud ; what water is available , falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeders today . that 's not enough . They 're looking for more rain than the cloud contains ! By massive seeding , by injecting something between 100 to 1,000 nuclei per liter of air , they try to change the whole dynamics of a cloud . When it works . Something like this happens : On the way to becoming a raindrop in a supercooled cloud , one whose temperature is below freezing . water enters an ice-crystal stage as moisture particles attach themselves to nuclei and freeze . The conversion releases immense quantities of heat . And the heat causes the cloud to balloon up and outward , sucking in masses of moisture-laden air , and dropping bits of ice , which thaw on the way down . The process becomes a self-perpetuating chain action . @# @#  | When Woodley decided to drop the flares in that first cloud , the water content looked fine : 1.5 grams per cubic meter . The temperature seemed good , too : minus 11.2 degrees C. But something went wrong . Ten minutes after seeding , the cloud 's top separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " explained Woodley . " It indicates a dry layer ? which only proves you can do nothing if nature wo n't cooperate . " Ten minutes later we found another cloud , rammed into it , and dropped 13 more flares . This ride was particularly rough . A rough ride means activity within the cloud , and seeding an active cloud is more rewarding . Cooperating cloud . This time the seeding worked . The cloud exploded in slow motion , changing from white to gray to black . We made another pass , then dropped back to wait , while the cloud ballooned from 19,000 feet to about 38,000 , blossoming to the sides to dominate our patch of sky . Suddenly I saw that across the top an anvil form was growing ? a perfect cumulonimbus ? the thunderhead . " Miami tells us it 's raining under there , " Woodley hollered in my ear , " at a rate of 1/2 inch an hour , a moderate amount . " He seemed pleased . Yet he was n't ecstatic . f knew why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a cloud dropped its moisture ? was n't all that uncommon . " Given the right conditions , anyone can do it , " says Woodley . Massive tests in 1968 and 1970 proved that seeding ? at least in the skies of Florida and the Caribbean ? can increase rainfall from selected clouds an average of 300 percent . Arranging mergers . The 1971 cloudseeders are after even bigger game : multicloud mergers . A few times in past years , Simpson and Woodley accidentally accomplished it ? seeded a cloud that merged with an adjacent one ? and the results were stupendous . Instead of increasing rainfall by two or three times , they increased it by 10 or 20 . And now , on this project , that kind of happening was the prime objective . Ten miles or so off to our left a large , crisp cumulus cloud appeared with a second one , slightly smaller , next to it . Woodley , pointing them out , said , " They look like good merger candidates . I think we should try . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly with Joanne Simpson , then directed the pilot toward the smaller cloud . It lay almost directly over the Tamiami Trail , some 35 miles northwest of Miami . At the top it brushed 22,000 fee- The first pass , at 3:21:55 pm , w just under 19,000 feet . Liquid wat content : about a gram ? fine ; tempe ' ature : minus 11.1 degrees C. ? go We dropped nine flares . Eight minutes later we made a se and pass at right angles to the firs and released 21 more flares . Then penetrated the other cloud . That s the roughest ride of the day . The meter showed 1.8 gs and one negati ' . g . Water content was the higher too : more than two grams . Far below , off to the leeward side an odd line snaked across the Eve glades . The line glowed . It was afla By now , 14 minutes after the se ing , the two clouds had blossomed u ward to maybe 30,000 ft , two ma moth pillars in the sunlight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Woodley . Again through the clouds ? bou cing and jouncing and shaking . S more flares in one , four in the oth and then we again stood back in t sky to watch . " We ca n't seed an more , " he told me . " Too much h pening in there . We would n't ms it out alive . " View from the fifth-floor . On a h cony at the university 's ComputerCenter in Coral Gables , meteorolo : Herb Lieb looked northwest , acr roofs , along the flat Florida horiz " I watched what happened and it magnificent , " he said later . " Spectacular . I 'd been out there a half he earlier and there was nothing but few small , natural clouds . In radar room a few minutes later I the two clouds building . " I took a chance that I might something live , and went out : again . But I was n't prepared for a thing like this . The towers mu roomed and merged until there just one enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To know that our men had done was sort of frightening . Out in the plane , Woodley mated that the cloud top was nudging 44,000 feet . Ordinarily , without merger , two clouds like those ml be expected to drop perhaps 200 feet of water each . During the of-. two hours that this merged system lasted , some 3,800 acre-feet of w fell ? 19 times greater . Next morning , the Miami office United Press International sent on its wire that " . . . Woodley and crew seeded a fat cloud they spot right over a 5,000-acre fire in northwest section of the Evergla That cloud dumped over two in of rain . . . It doused the fire . "
