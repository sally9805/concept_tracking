IN a crowded briefing room in Tel Aviv , a lean Israeli colonel last week presented to the world what Israel considers proof of a major Egyptian cease-fire violation . The colonel 's evidence came in the form of a series of large , fuzzy aerial photographs . To the untrained eye , the photos looked like little more than a jumble of black scratches and splotches on the desert sand . But to the Israeli military command , the pictures demonstrated that the Soviets and Egyptians had violated the truce as soon as it began at 1 a.m. on Aug. 8 by continuing to move SAM-2 antiaircraft missiles into the cease-fire zone . The photos were poor in quality , and had no reference as to when or where they were taken . " I admit you 'll have to rely on my word of honor that the dates of the pictures are correct , " said the colonel , who is an aide on the Israeli general staff . <P> The evidence was frankly not good enough for the U.S. intelligence community , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemmed in part from the substantial differences in the ways the U.S. and Israel gather and evaluate their intelligence . To monitor the Suez Canal front , the Israelis rely chiefly on high-speed passes by camera-carrying Phantoms during the daytime . At night , the mainstay of Israeli intelligence is a chain of electronic listening posts in the Sinai hills near the canal . But both these methods have glaring weaknesses : the Phantom pictures are often blurred , and the electronic sensors , which monitor Egyptian and Soviet radar and radio transmissions , frequently pick up ambiguous signals that are difficult to interpret . Furthermore , the Israeli listening devices can easily be spoofed by Egyptian and Soviet countermeasures . <P> The U.S. intelligence effort is considerably more sophisticated . Yet last week 's flap uncovered some amazing faults . One reason that the U.S. was unable to refute or substantiate the Israeli claims was simply its tardiness in getting off the mark . Although the truce went into effect on Aug. 8 , the U.S. was unable to get its U-2 reconnaissance planes over Suez until noon on Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job , allowing the brilliant sunlight to get in the camera and render his photos useless . Thus the first worthwhile flight was not made until Monday , almost three days after the cease-fire began . <P> U.S. intelligence experts had urged the start of flights as early as ten days before the ceasefire , but disagreements over what aircraft to use and negotiations to secure the permission of allied governments in the area delayed them . British , Spanish and Turkish diplomats called to the bureaucracies hemmed and hawed . <P> Another day was lost when Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan , aware that his enemy was moving missiles toward the canal , unexpectedly called for the truce to start 24 hours earlier than scheduled , hoping to stop the missiles in their tracks . The upshot was that at the crucial moment when the truce began , the U.S. had no immediate " before and after " shots to test the veracity of the Israeli claims that the Egyptians had deployed SAMs at six to 15 sites in the cease-fire zone after the truce went into effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
