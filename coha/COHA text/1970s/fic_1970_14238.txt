The hour has arrived for the play to begin . The wide amphitheatre stage stands empty and waiting , with the rich green tree-studded hill showing beyond at the rear . A single unseen TRUMPET up this hill sends out its call , then segues into the old familiar hymn , " St. Anne . " The hymn marches crescendo down the hill until the whole auditorium is pulsating with sound . After a moment of dwelling there , it returns up the hill the way it came , dying softly out . The voice of the unseen NARRATOR ( JOHN HECKEWELDER ) is heard now . JOHN HECKEWELDER ( Through the sound system . ) Friends , we are met this evening to pay honor to the men and women who some two hundred years ago came into this valley and created here for a while a way of life whose inspiration continues among us to this day . ( Fervently . ) Here in the heart of this Ohio land , In the peace and bosomed richness of these hills , These believers came , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood And set their living credo up , A home and shelter for the faith they cherished . ( Strongly . ) Not by hate and the iron fist , they said , But by love and the friendly open hand Should a man live out the greenery of his days And reap the mellow harvest of his soul . ( Somewhat announcingly . ) Here in this Tuscarawas Valley The drama of their great dream was acted out . ( Far up the hill an INDIAN DRUM is heard . The figure of CHIEF WHITE EYES on horseback appears there . He is an imposing person of middle age , dressed in his Indian ceremonials and carrying a long pennoned wooden lance or staff . The NARRATOR 'S voice continues now more matter-of-factly . ) The great White Eyes , chief of the Delaware Indians in Ohio , and his Grand Council are assembling by the Big Spring on this warm shad-running day in the month of March . They await the arrival of David Zeisberger , the teacher of the Christian Delaware Indians in Pennsylvania , for they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ka-wan-oh-a-oh ! Ka-wan-oh-a-oh ! ( Assemble , all assemble ! ) ( He rides on down the hill toward the audience . Two councilors , BIG CAT and STRONG ROCK , join him as he proceeds , entering on foot from the R. and L. They too are splendidly dressed for the occasion but with not as much color as their chief . BIG CAT carries a large folded piece of wampum and STRONG ROCK a long-stemmed peace pipe . Once more WHITE EYES sings out . ) Ka-wan-oh-a-oh ! Ka-wan-oh-a-oh ! ( As the three near the rear of C. , TWO YOUNG INDIAN MEN enter from the L. and R. carrying flaming torches held aloft . TWO OTHER ELDERLY INDIANS , presumably councilors , now join the GROUP , R. and L. , which has arrived full on the C. stage and somewhat to the R. WHITE EYES dismounts and a YOUTH enters and takes the horse away . The CHIEF holds up his lance . ) Brothers , Chiefs , head men of the Delawares , The sunlight is in my heart this day . BIG CAT Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts are open . WHITE EYES We have said yes to one another , Our lifted hands made witness , We kissed the pure white wampum , This day the knife and tomahawk are buried in the ground . p. 4 BIG CAT Yes , yes , it is true . WHITE EYES Let the warm sun of friendship beam forth . COUNCILORS ( In one voice . ) It is so . We the Grand Council do declare it ! WHITE EYES For now our white brother  --  The teacher of our people in the east  --  Comes to meet with us here by the Big Spring , Here by the sweet-flowing waters . BIG CAT We wait for him . STRONG ROCK We reach our open hands . BIG CAT Our council member , Chief Pipe , comes not . WHITE EYES He still growls in the forest , But he will see , will see . The way of the teacher is good . VOICES Is good . BIG CAT O Father , you are the great chief over Captain Pipe . STRONG ROCK His power is small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds in the forest off at the L. WHITE EYES answers . ) WHITE EYES All-oo ! ( In joyful announcement . ) Our friend is here ! ( DAVID ZEISBERGER , or Brother David as he is called , enters from the L. , a heavy cudgel in his hand . He is accompanied by JOHN HECKEWELDER and TWO CHRISTIAN INDIANS  --  ISAAC and MICHAEL . The latter two carry packs as well as long hunting rifles , and HECKEWELDER holds a strapped blanket roll . WHITE EYES hurries out to meet BROTHER DAVID , and they embrace . ) Welcome , Teacher Zeisberger  --  my brother . p. 5 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Middle-aged and of strong frame . ) Greetings , great chief . ( Acknowledging his companions . ) And with me  --  Brother John Heckewelder , your friend likewise  --  and Christian Delaware brothers Isaac and Michael , his son . WHITE EYES Welcome , Brother Heckewelder  --  yes  --  JOHN HECKEWELDER ( About 30 and strong and wiry . ) At Fort Pitt we met . Greetings again , Chief White Eyes . WHITE EYES Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east  --  and Michael  --  welcome  --  son of a brave father . ( The greetings go on in pantomime somewhat . WHITE EYES raises his pennoned staff . The scene is still . ) We are glad for this meeting day . DAVID ZEISBERGER Brothers , friends , grand councilors , Through the far hills and valleys To our mission halls of Bethlehem Your message came  --  Saying we will meet here by the Big Spring To say good words . We have come to hear , and to speak good words also . WHITE EYES ( Solemnly . ) Long days and nights our Indian heart Was sick within us . The spittle in our mouth tasted bitter , We spewed it out but it fast filled again , Like the gushing spring below the hill . ( He gestures toward the R. rear . ) We would wash away the blood , Restore the scalp and dry the streaming war bonnet , Be friends with the white man . p. 6 DAVID ZEISBERGER It is my prayer that this be so . WHITE EYES From the Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gestures . ) Our suffering people came to this Ohio land . Our uncles , the Wyandots and the Iroquois , made treaty for it . Much land from the great lake to the north To the big river to the south They marked to us forever . ( Grasping BROTHER DAVID 'S hand again . ) Now today , O friend and brother , We ask you to share this land with us , To bring our brown brothers with you from the east , Teach us here even as they are taught  --  You the father over us all . DAVID ZEISBERGER My beloved ones , my brethren , My heart is filled with thankfulness . WHITE EYES ( Gesturing R. and L. ) This valley we offer to you  --  From Goschochking to the south  --  To the town of Tuscarawas on the north , And hilltops to hilltops east and west . The Council so agrees . COUNCILORS ( Heartily . ) We do agree . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Astonished . ) Some thirty miles of your best land ! I have seen it . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small part . ( Loudly . ) We now make witness unto you . ( He indicates the folded wampum in BIG CAT 'S hands . A halloo sounds from the hill , and the young Delaware subchief , CAPTAIN PIPE , on horseback comes galloping down into the scene . He is accompanied by three or four SWIFT RUNNERS , lean hard fellows , naked save for their breechcloths , and carrying rifles . PIPE is something of a flamboyant , even fearsome character in his warpaint and feathers , his vermilion-colored coat , blue sash and bead-decorated belt , from which a tomahawk hangs . His naked body below his loin-cloth is also warpainted . He is called CAPTAIN PIPE because of his habit of ever puffing on a huge black , long-stemmed pipe . He is a man of great pride and zealously guarded dignity . Quickly dismounting , he strides into the scene . One of his RUNNERS leads the horse out and off . ) CAPTAIN PIPE ( Storming at WHITE EYES . ) So  --  and you would give away our homeland ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ragingly to BROTHER DAVID . ) Go back over the mountain , white man ! ( BROTHER DAVID takes a step toward him and holds out his hand , but PIPE ignores him. ) p. 8 DAVID ZEISBERGER I come as your friend , Captain Pipe . CAPTAIN PIPE My father was killed by white men . In his memory I smoke this black pipe of death . ( Indicates the pipe he carries . ) DAVID ZEISBERGER I will come to you in the forest and tell you the message of peace , of love , my brother . CAPTAIN PIPE ( With a yell . ) I am not your brother ! WHITE EYES I am your chief , Captain Pipe . I command you to silence . CAPTAIN PIPE ( To WHITE EYES . ) This land was the blanket of our fathers . You would tear it in two And give the better part to him for his teachings  --  False teachings and a false God . ( Pleadingly . ) I say to this council  --  Give not away our home ! JOHN HECKEWELDER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to make a better home for all  --  houses , fields , crops , cattle  --  CAPTAIN PIPE Where the white man comes the Indian dies . ISAAC ( About 50 , straight and lean . ) Once my heart was black and bitter Against the white man , Captain Pipe , But Brother David saved me with his message of love . p. 9 CAPTAIN PIPE ( Sardonically . ) The mighty Glikkikan , friend of my dead father , Now wearing a Christian name  --  Isaac . ( He spits mockingly . ) Dress thyself in petticoats and call thyself woman ! ( ISAAC reacts with instinctive anger at the insult , then controls himself . PIPE starts to leave but turns back as the high weird wailing voice of a woman is heard at the L. rear , accompanied by the sound of a wooden clacker being twirled in the air . A strange eldritch creature enters from L. C. This is WEYNAO , the witchwoman or lost one , known among the missonaries as ANN CHARITY . She is tall , emaciated , with long stringy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set with two vindictive , roving , wild black eyes . She wears a rough , somewhat tattered gray gown that comes down to the tops of her bare feet . ) ANN CHARITY ( Continuing her wailing and clacker accompaniment . ) Aih  --  ee ! Aih  --  ee ! Lenni Lenapi  --  ( Woe , woe ! ) Suppinqual ekesa ! ( Behold my bitter tears ! ) Aih-ee ! Aih  --  ee ! Pennau ekesa ! ( I weep for my people , the chosen ones ! ) ( BROTHER DAVID and the OTHERS turn to look toward the rear . CAPTAIN PIPE runs out to WEYNAO and takes her by the arm . She comes tearing forward and stops in front of BROTHER DAVID , winding her clacker the while . Her voices hisses from her . ) Welsit Manitou palli ali ! Swanachen ! ( The Good Great Spirit says be gone from our land . Dog of a white man ! ) p. 10 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Stares at the witchwoman with sympathy . ) Sorrowful one , this is Brother David . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed you , we gave you the name Ann Charity . Ann , do you hear me ? ( She stares balefully at him and shakes her clacker in his face . With a shrill scream she now rushes toward D. R. , then stops and stands there , wailing . ) ANN CHARITY Aih  --  ee ! Aih  --  ee ! CAPTAIN PIPE See what the white men have done to her ! The Big Knives marched through here in Pontiac 's war , killing and destroying  --  her husband murdered , her baby slain . ( Gesturing after WEYNAO . ) The bloodiness made her so  --  in here . ( He taps his forehead . ) The Great Spirit has set her to guard this Tuscarawas Valley . ( Nodding his plumed head from side to side and glaring at BROTHER DAVID . ) Her curse is upon you if you come here . You have great warning from her . ( Loudly . ) Leave our land . WHITE EYES ( Suddenly and commandingly . ) Let the Council speak . Bring forward the white wampum ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfold the wide belt of wampum and stretch it out . WHITE EYES marks the air with his lance as he recites above the belt ; and the COUNCILORS all place their right hands on it much as in the ritual of oath-taking in an American court . PIPE and his group turn angrily to one side and gather around ANN CHARITY as the words are intoned by the great chief . ) Today , Father , Brother , Here above the beautiful spring , We the tribes of the Delawares Do offer as a gift to our Brother David And to our Christian brothers waiting in the east , This land for their dwelling place . We now hold with our hands this white wampum , Pure and clean , as proof of our trust . Henceforth and forevermore we are bound in our word . p. 11 WHITE EYES AND COUNCILORS ( In unison . ) Till the sun cease from shining And the rivers run no more . ( They all bend and kiss the wampum . It is then handed to BROTHER DAVID who passes it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DAVID ZEISBERGER And this wampum shall be our flag of peace between us , We shall so make it in the days ahead . ( Lifting his eyes . ) May the blessings of heaven be upon this people . ( He and WHITE EYES embrace once more . Then the CHIEF claps his hands and calls off toward U. R. ) WHITE EYES All-oo ! All-oo  --  ah ! By the Big Spring we will have our feast of friendship ! DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Jubilantly . ) And then we will hurry away to Bethlehem to report to our Mission Board the news of this great gift . WHITE EYES ( Gesturing inclusively . ) Come , friends , brothers  --  all ! ( His invitation is sent toward PIPE , but that chief and his followers ignore it . Several DELAWARE MAIDENS now enter at U. R. carrying bowls of fruit and food held aloft . An Indian flute recorder , accompanied by a hand drum , starts up , and the motion of the girls is choreographed to it . The procession of WHITE EYES and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. L. C. , going down behind the hill close by . PIPE and his group now rush out onto the C. stage and to the sudden throbbing of a big Indian drum off-scene begin a brief energetic dance expressive of their disappointment and grief . The two TORCHBEARERS re-enter and join in the dance which quickly builds up to a climax , with ANN CHARITY now in the center whirling her clacker and giving her high " Aih-ee ! Aih-ee ! " Led by PIPE , they all suddenly dash away at U. R. The TORCHBEARERS look about them and scuttle back out at the rear and down the hill to the spring the way they came , hurrying no doubt to be in on the feast of friendship . A moment later PIPE is seen galloping back the way he came , followed by his runners . The ghostly and weird figure of ANN CHARITY is discerned moving up the hill and disappearing into the woods , the sound of her clacker dying away as the drum dies . The NARRATOR JOHN HECKEWELDER appears at D. L. of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buoyant feet Brother David and his helpers hurried the long way back to Bethlehem , there to urge the moving of the Delaware Indian mission to Ohio and to begin at once the great work he intended here . ( Gestures toward the L. side stage area and moves away in that direction. ) p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 A little room in the Gemeindehaus in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , some days later . In the C. rear is a rough table . On the rear wall is a posterlike , colorful painting some six by eight feet or more , depicting the ancient figure of the founder of the Moravian movement , Jan Hus , angular and exaggerated , tied to his stake of martyrdom . Across the bottom of the poster is the caption in large letters of Hus 's dying statement  --  " I shall die with joy in the faith of the gospel I have preached . " The sound of congregational singing is heard off-scene in Tallis ' childlike evening hymn , accompanied by the swelling tones of an organ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thee , my God , this night , For all the blessings of the light.Keep me , O keep me , King of kings , Beneath thine own almighty wings . Forgive me , Lord , for thy dear Son , The ill that I this day have done , That with the world , myself and thee , I , ere I sleep , at peace may be . ( Members of the CONGREGATION enter at the rear of the side stage and move along , as if on a path or street in front of the house , singing as they go . They are dressed in their Sunday best , and some of them carry hymnbooks . Coming last in the procession are BROTHER DAVID , JOHN HECKEWELDER , REVERENDS BERNARD GRUBE and CHRISTIAN GREGOR . They all are singing . ) O may my soul on thee repose , And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close , Sleep that may me more vig'rous makeTo serve my God when I awake . ( The SINGERS now change into the doxology words as they go on out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , all creatures here below , Praise him above , ye heavenly host , Praise Father , Son and Holy Ghost . ( The singing and the organ fade away . BROTHER DAVID and his GROUP turn into the room . As he enters , he unrolls a map he carries. ) p. 14 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( As he hurries to the table . ) During the song-service in the chapel there  --  a spirit of benediction was upon me  --  even confirming my hopes . The Indian offer of this land for our settlement in Ohio is an answer to prayer . ( He spreads out the map and spears it with a forefinger . ) See , Brothers , on this map  --  the stretch of goodly valley  --  here to build our first mission . BERNARD GRUBE ( An elderly , rubicund , jolly man , dressed in canonicals , stoutly intrrupting . ) But , Brother David , let us take time and consider fully . Only two hours ago you and Brother Heckewelder returned from your tiring journey to Ohio . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Impassionedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set an example for the people of all these thirteen colonies in dealing justly with the red man  --  with  --  CHRISTIAN GREGOR ( Of late middle age , rawbony , strong-voiced . ) We share your enthusiasm , Brother David , but we are cautious . ( Bends to look at the map . ) DAVID ZEISBERGER Cautious , yes , Brother Gregor , but  --  BERNARD GRUBE Our fear is that moving your converts so far to Ohio would leave you and them unprotected from the warlike Indians to the north and the west . p. 15 DAVID ZEISBERGER Yes , warlike now , but with our mission converts aiding , we will win their hearts . We will , we will ! BERNARD GRUBE What think ye , Brother John Heckewelder ? JOHN HECKEWELDER Chief White Eyes is our friend and has power over his people .  --  I would gladly go and work there unafraid . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Joyfully . ) See , see . CHRISTIAN GREGOR I still say let Brother David concentrate on the present mission work here in Pennsylvania , make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brother Gregor  --  there are hundreds of thousands of our brown brothers out there  --  ( He gestures. )  --  in the wilderness  --  proud , defiant , and most of them lost in hatred of the white man . If we do not work to wipe away this hatred , this fear they have of us , then the dark tragedy of blood shall stand as a lasting shame on the white man forever . Brother John , is it not true ? JOHN HECKEWELDER ( Firmly . ) I believe it . BERNARD GRUBE ( Holding up his hands . ) The rising quarrel between the colonies and Britain makes for especial uncertainty . Already in Boston the tax on tea has aroused the people  --  p. 16 CHRISTIAN GREGOR And the colonies are stirred to excitement by the latest acts of the British Parliament  --  from New Jersey to Georgia . If war broke out  --  DAVID ZEISBERGER War ? BERNARD GRUBE ( Persisting . ) You would be placed between the British military forces at Detroit to the west and the Americans at Fort Pitt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the quarreling colonies and the mother country do face each other the while we and our work lie between-the better so . For then we can strive for friendship on both sides . From our settlement there in Ohio we can . CHRISTIAN GREGOR ( To GRUBE . ) Let us defer action the while we study the matter further  --  DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Crying out . ) The time is now ! Let us sound forth the trumpet of the Lord  --  and march ! BERNARD GRUBE ( Chuckling . ) You are a trumpet of the Lord yourself , Brother David . CHRISTIAN GREGOR And a loud one  --  BERNARD GRUBE ( Announcingly as he snaps his fingers . ) We will leave the decision to our church method . Let a drawing of the lot settle the matter . ( Gestures to HECKEWELDER who nods and goes out. ) p. 17 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Distressed . ) But if the lot says nay  --  BERNARD GRUBE Then you must wait till a later drawing . Now while the reeds with their ballots are being brought , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with you . ( BROTHER DAVID looks at him . ) All these years you have worked among the Indians without a helpmeet . DAVID ZEISBERGER A helpmeet ! BERNARD GRUBE ( Somewhat ironically . ) Yes , a helpmeet . DAVID ZEISBERGER Hear ye , Brothers . In treading the great forests and their vast solitude I feel a Divine Providence ever with me  --  feel that the work I do is blessed work . He is my helpmeet . ( TWO DELAWARE INDIAN WOMEN converts come suddenly into the scene . The white ribbons on their caps denote they are widows . The first , SISTER ZENOBIA , is big and blooming , and the second , SISTER KEZIAH , is bantamlike and wiry . They hurry to BROTHER DAVID with expressions of joy . ) ZENOBIA Thanks be to our blessed Savior , you have returned safe , Brother David ! ( Seizes his hand to kiss it . ) KEZIAH My special prayers protected you and brought you safe home , Brother David . ( Grabs BROTHER DAVID 'S other hand. ) p. 18 DAVID ZEISBERGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisters . ( GRUBE and GREGOR look on somewhat amused , but disapproving . BROTHER DAVID gets his hands free . ) ZENOBIA It was my prayers that protected you from the wild varmints . KEZIAH Nay , nay , it was mine . BERNARD GRUBE Let it be both , then . ZENOBIA ( Holding up a piece of woven material . ) Brother David , the shirt I am weaving for thee is nigh finished . KEZIAH These good warm stockings  --  I knitted them while singing the blessed hymn , " Sleepers Awake . " All is finished but the toe , Brother David . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Sweating . ) My thanks , dear sisters , my thanks . BERNARD GRUBE Now away with you ! ( Shoos the widows out . ) CHRISTIAN GREGOR ( Laconically . ) You are well looked after , Brother David . BERNARD GRUBE Uhm  --  DAVID ZEISBERGER ( With emphasis . ) Sister Zenobia and Sister Keziah care for my food and clothing needs . They are most faithful . ( HECKEWELDER re-enters , followed by MICHAEL , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps over to the basket which MICHAEL holds extended. ) p. 19 BERNARD GRUBE You will close your eyes , Michael , and let Providence guide your hand as you lift out one of these reeds . We shall see what the decision is  --  whether it says no to Brother David , or yes , or is a blank . ( BROTHER DAVID turns aside and with closed eyes and clasped hands begins to pray fervently and silently . ) CHRISTIAN GREGOR ( Irritatedly . ) Brother David is unfair . He already is trying to get God on his side . ( Gestures to GRUBE , and the two turn aside and begin praying silently and fervently also for their side . HECKEWELDER stands looking on . MICHAEL now closes his eyes , stirs his hand around in the basket and lifts out one of the little reeds . GRUBE opens it , pulls forth a little wad of paper , unrolls it and stares at it . The men turn to him anxiously , BROTHER DAVID pushing up ahead of the others . ) BERNARD GRUBE The lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to us , Brother Gregor , Brother John  --  that the  --  ( After a pause. )  --  the answer to his wish to move the mission to Ohio  --  the answer is  --  yes . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( With a shout as he looks upward . ) My thanks , Heavenly Father ! ( Starts rolling up the map in a hurry to be gone . ) We must gather our supplies at once . At once , Brother John , Brother Michael ! ( There is a general exit toward the door . GRUBE catches BROTHER DAVID by the arm. ) p. 20 BERNARD GRUBE Attend a moment , Brother David . ( HECKEWELDER and MICHAEL go on out . GRUBE continues . ) About the matter I mentioned  --  a helpmeet  --  DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Alarmed . ) There is no time now , Brother Grube . ( Puts out a warding hand . ) BERNARD GRUBE ( Sternly again . ) Our Board of Elders last evening voted that you be provided with a companion in your work . ' T is not seemly for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( His jaw dropping down . ) A wife ! CHRISTIAN GREGOR ( Again laconically . ) A helpmeet . BERNARD GRUBE There are several women here in Bethlehem who would willingly share in your missionary work . I know of three . CHRISTIAN GREGOR I know of five . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( His eyes flaring . ) Five ! BERNARD GRUBE All gentle and fair women , especially Sister Susan . ( Lifting his hand as BROTHER DAVID stirs and looks toward the door . ) And seeing that you are somewhat past the prime of life now  --  p. 21 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Sharply . ) I am not past my prime of life ! I can measure my strength with any man  --  walk as far , swing my axe as deep in the heart of a tree . The humors and vapors of youth are turned to bone and gristle and will power within me . ( With the rolled-up map under his arm , he raises two heavy fists in the air . ) Long ago I made a promise of single blessedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians . I have kept that promise . ( Lets his fists fall and continues with something of defensiveness . ) The life in Ohio will be overly hard for a gentlewoman . BERNARD GRUBE ( With one of his chuckles . ) I warrant Sister Susan would manage . ( Peremptorily . ) I ask that you converse with her  --  even if briefly . ( Puts out his hand behind him biddingly and goes out with GREGOR . ) ( BROTHER DAVID is almost in a rage to be on with his preparations , and he would stride out of the scene now but for SUSAN LECRON 'S appearing in the door . She comes on into the room . She is simply and tastefully dressed and wears a charming cap , the rose-pink ribbon of which denotes she is unmarried . She curtsies to BROTHER DAVID , then stands with somewhat downcast eyes . He looks around as if seeking some means of escape , twisting the map in his strong hands . SUSAN is a blue-eyed , flaxen-haired young woman of 27 or 28 , full-bodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appealing . Her natural attractiveness is heightened by the apple blushes of the moment in her cheeks. ) p. 22 SUSAN LECRON ( Adopting the Quaker address . ) Wouldst thou converse with me , Brother David ? DAVID ZEISBERGER ( A little roughly . ) I must away to Ohio now  --  and  --  SUSAN LECRON I would fain help thee in thy work there . DAVID ZEISBERGER Then let your prayers for our new settlement be your help . ( Moves toward the door . She moves softly in front of him . ) SUSAN LECRON ( Forgetting the Quakers . ) I would both pray and work . My hands are strong , Brother David , they are . ( Holds them out . ) DAVID ZEISBERGER In my heart is no room for  --  for woman  --  ( Gulping. )  --  as woman . All these years I have lived in single blessedness  --  single in purpose , single in mind . As the scriptures say in First Corinthians  --  SUSAN LECRON ( Breaking in . ) I work here , I spin , I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , I read the catechism and help with the milking . And as I churn and make the butter , what 's in my mind ? Brother David and his mighty work  --  they 're in my mind  --  p. 23 DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Shaking his head determinedly . Quotingly . ) " He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord . " SUSAN LECRON ( Back at him quickly . ) " And the Lord God said , it is not good that man should be alone  --  I will make an helpmeet for him . " Genesis 2:18 . And that 's much older . DAVID ZEISBERGER ( In spite of himself beginning to get a bit interested in SUSAN 'S knowledge as well as her wit . ) The married woman " careth for the things of the world "  --  says Apostle Paul  --  ( With a little chuckle. )  --  " how she may please her husband , " Hebrews 13 , verse 34 . SUSAN LECRON ( Laughing suddenly . ) And the husbands love to be so pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours is secular talk , Sister Susan . ( Somewhat sternly . ) Keep it pious , religious . SUSAN LECRON We are talking about man and woman  --  their need for each other . You need me , Brother David  --  And Apostle Paul also says  --  " For it is better to marry than to burn . " DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Giving her a quick look . ) The full verse is  --  " If they can not contain , let them marry , for it is better  --  " and so on . Well , I can contain . p. 24 SUSAN LECRON I find it most hard to contain . In my dreams at night  --  DAVID ZEISBERGER ( Alarmed again . ) Now , now , Sister Susan , mind your speech . SUSAN LECRON ( Suddenly quoting again . ) " Art thou bound unto a wife ? Seek not to be loosed . " Verse 27 . DAVID ZEISBERGER The same verse , it reads , " Art thou loosed ? Seek not a wife . " ( Suddenly adopting a fatherly manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I  --  ( Resolutely . ) I 'm past the prime of life .

( They both laugh . ) DAVID ZEISBERGER Farewell , Sister Susan . SUSAN LECRON ( Humbly , forlornly , but quickly . ) And in parting may the token of peace be between us. p. 25 DAVID ZEISBERGER I give thee a brother 's blessing . ( Bends over and touches the top of her head in a pecking kiss and draws back , but not quickly enough . Her capable arms embrace him , and she leans her head against his breast . He gasps out his alarm . ) Woman ! Woman ! SUSAN LECRON Your arms are strong , Brother David .

I must assemble my colony for Pennsylvania  --  I mean Ohio  --  at once . ( Almost with a shout . ) Your pardon ! ( Charges through the door and out . SUSAN takes a step after him . ) SUSAN LECRON Mayhap I sinned , Brother Grube . I fear I tempted him . BERNARD GRUBE ( With his chuckle again . ) Even as you intended , Sister . But I doubt heaven would call that sinning. p. 26 SUSAN LECRON I pray not . BERNARD GRUBE Be not discouraged .

Supplies of food , clothing , household goods , tools and seeds for the settlement there must be collected . After a few weeks all was in order , and the colonists went on their long journey . It was ordered that I , John Heckewelder , would join them later . ( Somewhat poetically . ) Stout were their heartsAnd brave the song they sang ! And they marched , and they marched . ( In the distance at the rear , coming through one of the hidden speakers , the voices of the unseen colonists are heard , raised in a rich harmony of their marching song .

( A crackle of lightning and a roll of stern-toned thunder run through the sound track as if deep under the earth . They rumble along up the hill at the rear , swallowing the singing for a moment . The storm bit is repeated with some echo vehemence and with an accompanying whish and whoom of wind and the thudding of pouring raindrops against the fat breast of the earth . This lasts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be succeeded by a feeling of clearing weather and sunny skies  --  illustrated in the reaction of the NARRATOR as well as in the spirit of the singing .

Some of the men are armed with flintlock rifles , and others carry axes , mattocks , shovels and hoes . Two or three of the women have babies in their arms . The song dies away in a long " Amen . " As they all come streaming in , a few little boys and girls go hopping and skipping about . Whatever the fatigue of the people , the scene is an ad lib of elation . WHITE EYES and BROTHER DAVID hurry toward each other and embrace . ISAAC moves forward with BROTHER DAVID .

It was work  --  work  --  labor  --  labor , and a song in every heart ! ( The sound of many voices is heard coming in from the rear , all raised in a hymn of faith and joy , a labor song in rich four-part harmony . The NARRATOR turns and stands gazing in that direction . The scene grows activated as the song goes on . ) PEOPLE What can we offer thee , O Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fain would we thy great name record &nbsp; &nbsp; And worthily set forth thy praise.Dear object of our faith and love  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom our more than all we owe  --  Open the fountain from above &nbsp; &nbsp; And let it on our spirits flow . ( A theatrical statement of work and building now begins . A number of MEN led by MICHAEL roll in the skeleton frame of Brother David 's cabin and bring it to rest D. L. of the C. stage . Then OTHERS led by ISAAC push the frame of the chapel in from R. and place it at R. C. Still others move in smaller cabin frames and place them in C. and at the rear . Up the hill at the rear BROTHER DAVID and HECKEWELDER are seen overseeing the erection of other cabin structures . The singing continues the while . ) O multiply thy sower 's seed &nbsp; &nbsp; And fruit we every hour shall bear , Throughout the world thy gospel speed , &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy everlasting grace declare .

Other benches are brought in by various women , some of them unmarried as their pink cap ribbons denote . JONAS and ANTON fetch in a bed for Brother David 's cabin , and KEZIAH comes in with pillows and blankets and makes it up . ZENOBIA , helped along by a little BOY , brings in a small rough table and places it in the cabin , then sets papers and inkwell on it with a long-feathered goose-quill pen stuck in the well . After correcting KEZIAH 'S method of folding back the bed cover , she hurries off the way she came . FOUR WOMEN are seen in the " field " just back of the C. stage , pantomiming planting corn . ANOTHER WOMAN begins sweeping the yard clean in front of the chapel . ABRAHAM enters with the peace flag and fastens it outward leaning from the corner of the chapel wall . WILLIAM HENRY enters with two buckets of water carried by a yoke over his shoulders . ESTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dips up water which she takes over to MICHAEL who is now helping Brother David 's cabin to its final placement . He drinks and smiles his warm thanks at her . He hands the gourd back , reaches suddenly out and kisses her . KEZIAH lets out an " Uh-uh ! " as she observes it . ESTHER hurries back to the bucket with the dipper and passes out water to other workers . All the while the singing has continued . Several CHILDREN playing tag run through the scene . ESTHER tears somewhat reprimandingly after them . TWO WOMEN enter the chapel with a big Bible and a hymnal and place them on the rustic lectern . TWO MEN come through the scene with a long and ancient cross-cut saw on their way to cut logs . A MAN brings in a log mortar and TWO WOMEN with a pestle begin pounding corn into meal in it in pantomine . NOTE : The director will theatricalize this " labor " scene to get the best effect .

( The singing continues fadingly . The NARRATOR turns back toward the audience. ) p. 42 JOHN HECKEWELDER Soon the first school and the first church in Ohio had been built , and the mission at Schoenbrunn seemed firmly established . But all was not serene with the colony . The storm clouds of the Revolutionary War grew ever more ominous , and the resentful Captain Pipe stayed deep in the forest , sullen and aloof . Brother David , true to his promise , walked the vast and dangerous wilderness to bring the message of friendship and help to that young chief and his people . ( Gestures toward R.

Two or three of the warriors hold lances in their hands , others hold rifles . NOTE : This scene should simulate the one shown in the painting in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , entitled " The Power of the Gospel .

At the L. , adjoining the cabin , the log wall of the chapel shoulders in , with its little belfry and bell projecting above the stage masking . Behind the cabin a piece of picket fence gives the feeling of enclosure . Low and just in front of the cabin is a bed of summer flowers with their gorgeous bloomings of yellow , red and blue .

If he picks up the hatchet , civil war will break out among his people , and more and more the woeful waste , the sorrows and the bleedings will befall . ( Now almost fiercely at BEN and his COMPANIONS . ) This is the way we fight ! VOICES Amen . Yes , yes . Right , Brother David . DAVID ZEISBERGER If this new nation shall come to be , let us hope it will be true to its pledge of good will among all men  --  ( Loudly. ) that it will wage peace and no more resort to war . p. 95 VOICES Amen !

( The young MEN of Pipe 's group begin beating the ground with stamping feet , milling about , sending forth their war cries the while . ' One of White Eyes ' young MEN starts to join them but the CHIEF stops him . The hatchet of war , wrapped in a blood-red-wampum belt , is handed forward to PIPE now by one of his men . He holds it toward WHITE EYES who in a bit of ritualistic pantomime reaches to take it and thus commit his Delaware nation to war . BROTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and flings it across the scene . SIMON GIRTY pulls his dirk and with a howl springs at BROTHER DAVID . ISAAC and others jump to BROTHER DAVID 'S defense , but PIPE and some of his warriors hinder them . WHITE EYES and his men oppose PIPE . BROTHER DAVID handles matters for himself . His powerful hand shoots out , grabs GIRTY by the collar and , with a backward jerk over his knee , flings that character against the ground with a numbing smash . Then with his foot on GIRTY 'S chest and grasping the hand that holds the dirk , he looks down at the writhing man . GIRTY tries to pull one of his pistols . ISAAC darts around and disarms him. ) p. 100 DAVID ZEISBERGER We 'll take your knife , Simon Girty . ( The knife falls to the ground . BROTHER DAVID picks it up .

The LIGHT FADES down on the C. stage somewhat and flares up along the hill high at the rear . There HECKEWELDER and his assistant JOHN MARTIN are seen galloping along . MARTIN carries the American Stars and Stripes flying in the wind . WHITE EYES and his COUNCILORS move farther to the rear , looking off . ) VOICES Cheers for Brother John ! ' Ray ! ' Ray ! SIMON GIRTY ( Somewhat recovers his dignity . Shouting . ) He will bring lies  --  lies ! CAPTAIN PIPE We will wait . We will hear !

HECKEWELDER wears a tricornered black hat and an old buffalo robe poncho-like over his shoulders . MARTIN is a native convert and is dressed in the usual convert garb  --  buckskin trousers , coat , shirt , etc . HECKEWELDER pulls a document from under his poncho-shirt as he hurries forward . He clasps BROTHER DAVID 'S hand , then turns to CHIEF WHITE EYES and greets him in frontier fashion  --  hand and arm-clasping . ) JOHN HECKEWELDER ( Announcingly to all . ) This dispatch from General Washington !

We are brothers still . p. 104 WHITE EYES Now we go to my lodge and make good words to send to my Brother Washington  --  ( As if issuing a directive. )  --  from our capital at Goschochking , saying we keep the peace and we will not break our word !

Some of WHITE EYES ' young MEN show their disgruntlement in moving along with their chief . He gestures them peremptorily on , calling out loudly . ) Ka-wan-o-ah-o ! ( They slothfully obey .

We will listen to the story of Brother Heckewelder 's great ride  --  a ride that has saved our dream in Ohio and perhaps helped preserve the new nation that is to be .

HECKEWELDER turns back toward the audience taking off his hat and poncho the while  --  thus signifying the change of his character to NARRATOR . The LIGHT COMES IN on him. ) p. 106 JOHN HECKEWELDER Some historians say that Heckewelder 's ride was one of the most important events in the Revolutionary War , for it did keep White Eyes and his powerful warriors from joining the British . But in spite of all our efforts at peace and good will , the suspicion and distrust of us by both the English and Americans increased . Girty and Pipe continued their scheming . They laid their accusations before the British governor at Detroit , and he sent a brutal directive against us . ( Gestures toward the R. and turns in that direction . ) ( From the darkness the sound of a SENTRY 'S call is heard . " Halt  --  who goes there !

Two BRITISH SOLDIERS enter armed . SOLDIER Captain Pipe  --  Commander Girty . ( He salutes . GIRTY responds to the salutation with an awkward salute and PIPE the same . ) SIMON GIRTY ( Joyously . ) An answer from the governor ! SOLDIER The same . He orders you to seize the white missionary teachers and fetch them to Detroit to be tried before the commandant there . SIMON GIRTY As spies and traitors ! What now , old David Zeisberger ! SOLDIER ( Pulls a document from his shirt . As if reading from the document . ) It is further ordered that all care shall be taken as to their safety .

SIMON GIRTY And with them teachers out of the way , we 'll soon have a rising of thousands of young warriors  --  and then over the mountains we 'll pour  --  ( With a shout . ) Lay down your arms , ye Americans !

From the darkness of the C. stage the MUSIC organ strikes up in an Indian Christmas carol , and people are heard singing . The LIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 SCENE 3 The settlement at Gnadenhutten . In the center is the now empty schoolhouse . We see into it as if the front wall were off . A sort of cradle or manger is in the middle of the floor . A big star of peace hangs from a rafter above it . The place is somewhat decorated with Christmas greenery , and here and there red-berried bittersweet branches . Only the fore-part of the scene is lighted at first , leaving the rest in shadow . At the rear the dim outlines of some of the Gnadenhutten cabins can be seen . PEOPLE are coming in from the rear around behind the little schoolhouse and on to D. R. and L. , singing as they come . The flag of peace hangs from its horizontal staff at the corner of the building .

He is singing also . At the end of the stanza he lifts his Bible , and the music dies down to a harmonious humming as the accompaniment to his words. ) p. 110 DAVID ZEISBERGER And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed . And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem with Mary his wife . ( During the reading JOHN HECKEWELDER as Joseph and SARAH HECKEWELDER as Mary enter the shadowed schoolhouse , and SARAH places her baby in the manger trough . She is wearing a halo . ) And she brought forth her first born son and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn .

And lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them . And they were sore afraid . ( The light on the C. stage dims even more , and a glow comes up on the L. side stage , and there we see three or four " SHEPHERDS " with their crooks looking off and up at the night . And as the music and the humming of the CONGREGATION now intensify , an ANGEL appears on the masking high above the SHEPHERDS . From the semi-darkness of the C. stage BROTHER DAVID 'S voice continues , and the figure of the ANGEL makes a benediction over the SHEPHERDS below . ) And the angel said unto them , Fear not , for behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people .

And on earth peace , Good will toward men . ( The chant now echoes up the hill and away into the night , then on into the sky . The ANGEL disappears . The PEOPLE and the organ listen to the echo an instant and then resume the carol . The SHEPHERDS enter singing at the U.

The music swells and the LIGHT begins to FADE . As it does so , the music modulates into the hymn of peace . The LIGHT FLARES UP along both side areas and down on the C. stage and there the PEOPLE of Gnadenhutten ring the auditorium . As one voice they burst into their challenging call to the audience and to the night around , the music also thundering forth its affirmation and its command. )                     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
