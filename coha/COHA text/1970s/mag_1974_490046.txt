THE SPOTTING SCENE COACH 1-1KE the laconic , lasso-twirling cow boy , the baby-faced gangster with the wide-brimmed fedora , and the cynical private eye of incor  --  ruptible moral character , the football coach is a distinctly American institu  --  tion . Perhaps the first coach to gain a national reputation was Walter Comp , who , a short time after the first , rudi  --  mentary game was played , between Rutgers and Princeton , in 1869 , took over as football 's guiding spirit . Camp played for Yale six years ( 1876 through 1881 1 ; the last two years , he was at  --  tending Yale Medical School , but in those days graduate students were eli  --  gible to play football . In 1888 , he be  --  came the team 's graduate adviser , as the post was known , and he contin  --  ued in that role until 1910 , when he resigned . Hr never assumed the formal title of bead coach , and he never ac  --  cepted money for his work with the tram . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of coaching , which meant that the pre  --  vious year 's captain returned the next fall as held coach and worked with the incumbent captain in directing the team , assisted , if they so wished , h% an Old Blue of their choice  --  the gradu  --  ate adviser . In Camp 's day , they so wished , for he had an enormous rep  --  utation . He represented Yale at a convention on collegiate football rides dur  --  ing his junior year , the first of three seasons he was captain , and he contin  --  ued to represent it at every subsequent convention for the next forty-seven Years . ( He began selecting his annual All-America team in 1889 . ) Yale football under Camp 's aegis followed a strange , if eminently successful , method of operation . After two years of medi  --  cal school , he had decided that he was not cut out to be a doctor , and , enter  --  ing the commercial world , he joined the New Haven Clock Company , ris  --  ing eventually to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it impossible for him to be on hand for the team 's afternoon practice sessions , but he was represented there by a person of unusual acumen  --  his wife , the former Alice Graham Sum  --  ner , who , by the way , was a sister of the renowned sociologist William Gra  --  ham Sumner . She attended the team 's daily workouts without fail , took notes on what happened , and , early even/ evening , went over with her husband the team 's progress on the field . Ac  --  cordingly , when the captain , the field coach , and a few assorted players dropped in later at the Camps ' house for a chat in the parlor , the graduate adviser was able to go into particulars in preparing the team for its upcoming opponent . On Saturdays , of course , he was able to attend the games in person . During Camp 's tenure as graduate Adviser , Yale won two hundred and fifty-one games , tied twelve , and lost only fourteen . Aside from organiza  --  tional ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which football could overcome its weaknesses and he de  --  veloped into a better game . ( As early as 1880 , he had persuaded a rules con  --  vention to adopt three of his sugges  --  tions : the concept of a scrimmage line , to govern the position of the two teams at the start of each play ; the estab  --  lishment of the quarterback as the man who directed the offense ; end the re  --  duction of the number of play rrs on a team from fifteen to eleven . ) He did not , however , have the inventive spark of some of the other early coaches  --  most notably Fielding H. Yost , Glenn S. ( Pop ) Warner , and Amos Alonzo Stagg  --  when it came to concocting new systems of attacking and defend  --  ing . Between 1901 and 1905 , Yost 's offense-oriented Michigan teams came close to averaging a point a minute , and their coach became known as Hur  --  ry Up Yost . Warner , a graduate of Cornell , first came to fame as the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorpe , who was an All-America halfback in 1911 and 1912 , Warner 's most noteworthy in  --  novations were the single-wing and double-wing formations , which he evolved between 1906 and 1912 . Stagg , one of Camp 's outstanding pu  --  pils , who spent most of his seventy-one -- year career as a coach at the Univer  --  sity of Chicago , had possibly the most imaginative football mind of all time . He came up with everything from the huddle to the direct pass from center , the radical ends-back formation , the reverse ( as early as 1890 ) , the 7-2-2 defense , the lateral pass , man in mo tion , numbering the players ( in 1913 ) , the 6-2-1-2 defense ( in 1932 ) , and the double-flanker offense ( in 1947 ) . After the First World War , college football burgeoned into a sort of na  --  tional mania , and its leading coaches were better known  --  and often with good reason  --  than many national po  --  litical figures . The most successful coach of this period was Knute Rockne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his father , a Norwegian engineer , emigrated to this country , grew up with the growing game , and by 1918 , when he took over at Notre Dame , had at  --  tained an almost matchless technical proficiency . He was exceptional in an  --  other way : he stands as a prime example of the football coach who is able to rouse his team to a fervid pitch of emotion be  --  fore the crucial game . The hest-known of the many stories about this ability of R.ockne 's centers on George Gipp , Notre Dame 's legendary superstar , who died from the complications of a streptococcus infection just a week or two after the close of the football sea  --  son in 1920 , his senior car . No one knows for sure whether as Gipp lay dying in the hospital he told Rockne that someday , when the team was faced with winning a really important game and was not playing well , he hoped the coach would tell the players at halftime to win it for George Gipp . For that matte r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the Indiana game in 1921 or in the Army game in 1928 ? or , indeed , on mans different Saturdats over a long spread of years that Rockne , in the locker room at half  --  time , lowered his voice dramatically and told his squad about Gipp and then said , " This is the time to go out and win inci for the Gipper . " In any event , the phrase became as memorable as any in American sport . Another coach who had the gift of getting his teams " up " for the big occasions was Thomas Al  --  bert Dwight ( - Tad ) Jones , an outstand  --  ing Yale player who returned in 1916 to coach the college 's team and enjoyed a decade of considerable success . Jones 's fight talks were a good deal less the  --  atrical than Rockne 's but , in their own way , no less stirring . In the hush of the locker room before the Harvard game- - au-  game  --  Jones would say to his team , " Gentlemen , you arc now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your whole life will you do anything so important . " This was often true , on two levels . In the minds and hearts of many men who had been on the team at Yale , nothing that subse  --  quently happened in their lives did touch them quite as deeply or mean quite as much to them as playing against Har  --  vard  --  it was as simple as that . Second , in a more practical context , if a man was fortunate enough to play a re  --  markably good game against Harvard , it often changed his entire life : lie went on to marry the rich girl he had thought would never take him serious  --  ly , he was offered spectacular business opportunities by firms that appreciated the value of his new glamour , and so on and on . Yale nu-n never forgot their hero 's deeds . As for professional football , which dates back to 1895 , when two town teams in western Pennsylvania La trobe and Jeannette  --  clashed in La  --  trobe , a suspicion of order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Football League , in 1921 . The N.F.L. coaches , nevertheless , were . a somewhat different breed from those in the college ranks . An excellent example was George Halas , a tough , stubborn young athlete from the Bohemian section of Chicago , who captained Illinois in 1917 , before joining the Great Lakes Naval Train  --  ing Station team , which went to the 1919 Rose Bowl and won . After the war , Halas rounded up the best players he knew and formed an outfit that was known , variously , as the Staley Starch-makers , the Staley A.C. , or sim the Staleys  --  after its sponsor , the A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company , which was a corn-products concern in De  --  catur , Illinois . What led Halas to do this was his belief , which had first been enunciated by his old coach at Illinois , Bob Zuppke , that just when most foot  --  ball players were beginning to develop their talent , they graduated from col  --  lege and never played again . In 1921 , Halas moved the Staleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.F.L. , a distinction shared by only two other league teams still in operation  --  the Green Bay Packers and the St. Louis Cardinals . In 1922 , when the team was fully established in Chi  --  cago , Halas changed its name to the Bears , and , because he ate , drank , and slept football twelve months a year , the Bears were regularly a dominant pow  --  er in the N.F.L. until this country entered the Second World War . By the end of the 1941 season , they had won five league championships . ( During the same period , the Packers , the Bears ' traditional rivals , also won five cham  --  pionships . ) Under Halas , the Bears , the roughest and most intimidating team in the league , came to be known as the Monsters of the Midway , but they became a great team only in the nineteen-thirties , when two of Halas 's associates , Clark Shaughnessy and Ralph Jones , installed a refined version of the T formation , primarily by adding a man in motion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic system in both pro and college football , and still is . Off and on , Halas coached the Bears for thirty-nine years , and lie mellowed hardly at all with the passage of time . In 1967 , his last season as head coach , he was still happiest when he was terrorizing the officials at a game , rasping instructive abuse at them as he stalked the sidelines . Just as college football en  --  tered its golden age at the close of the First World War , professional football under  --  went a period of tremendous growth after the Second World War , eventually over  --  taking and passing major-league baseball as the coun  --  try 's most popular sport . The coaches changed with the game . While many pro teams continued to be led by brawny , broad-backed retired stars ? " spirit guys , " who relied mainly on inspiring enthusiasm in their players , and who frequently had trouble keeping their " X " s and " O " s straight as they diagrammed plays at the blackboard  --  the trend was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the acute analytical approach , who was as much at home with the endless details and nuances of modern football as Bertrand Russell was with advanced mathematics . Paul Brown was the prototype of this kind of coach . A slight man of average height with a clean-cut face , Brown was raised in that hotbed of football Massillon , Ohio . He played quarter-hack on the high-school team and also at Miami University in Ohio . After a few seasons coaching at a small prep school , he returned to Massillon as head coach of the high-school team . Somewhat distant , somewhat cold in his outward demeanor , he drilled his players longer and harder than most coaches did . To make certain they un  --  derstood his system , he required the players to take regular exams , both oral and written , regarding their assign  --  ments on a large number of plays . In his nine years at Massillon High , Brown 's teams scored three thousand two hundred and two points to three hundred and thirty-nine for their op  --  ponents , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio State . Brown moved on the next year to become head coach at Ohio State , and then , during the war , at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station . In 1946 , when a new profes  --  sional league , the All America Foot  --  ball Conference , began its first season , Cleveland was represented by a team called the Browns in honor of its coach  --  already a household name in the Midwest . Brown 's first intention was to build an offense based on a crushing yet deceptive running attack , but as lie came to appreciate how beau  --  tifully his offensive unit executed its passing plays  --  Otto Graham was at quarterback , Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli were the ends , and huge Mar  --  ion Motley , who blocked and ran the trap plays magnificently , was the full  --  back  --  he placed more and more em  --  phasis on the pass . During the four years ( 1946 through 1949 ) that the A.A.F.C. lasted , the Browns won the championship every year . They then entered the N.F.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior league , and proceeded to astonish the football world by winning the N.F.L. cham  --  pionship that first season , 1950 . They repeated as champions in 1954 and 1955 , after losing the championship playoff game in the three intervening seasons . To be brief , Brown 's Browns were one of the great teams of all time . A man who liked to run everything , Brown called each offensive play from the sidelines  --  he was the first coach to do so  --  sending in the play with one of the two guards he alternated . Follow  --  ing the 1962 season , after an unhappy period in which he and the club 's new ownership were in constant disagree  --  ment , Brown Left the Cleveland or  --  ga.nizatiun . He stayed out of the game . for five years , then came back in 19611 as coach and general manager of a new expansion team , the Cincinnati Ben-gals . A fast , slick young club , the Bengals made the playoffs for the first time in 1970 , their third season . Brown himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been coach  --  ing . Indeed , it might still be the Gra  --  ham era , one feels as one catches sight of Brown on the sideline during a Bengals game and takes in the familiar trim figure with the invariable snap-brim hat , the well-cut suit or the classic camel's-hair polo coat , and the set facial expression , which alters hardly a whit as he sends in the next play . When Brown returned to pro foot  --  ball , he was no longer looked upon as the wonder man of the game . Ap  --  proaches and methods are always changing in football , as they do in every activity , and Brown had been supplanted as the No. 1 guru by Vince Lombardi , of the Packers Lombardi had arrived at Green Bay in 1959 , aft  --  er that historic football wellspring had gone through eleven successive grim seasons with teams that never once won more games than they lost . Lombardi instantly turned things around . In 1959 , the Packers won seven games out of twelve . In 1960 , they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four points to the Philadel  --  phia Eagles . In 1961 and 1962 , they won the league championship , beating the New York Giants both times . In 1965 , they won the championship again , defeating the Browns in the title game , Then , in 1966 and 1967 , came their crowning accomplishments : after winning the N.F.L. championship in two exciting games with the Dallas Cowboys , 34-27 and 21-17 , they out  --  played the Kansas City Chiefs , the champions of the American Football League , in the first Super Bowl game , and then the Oakland Raiders , 33-14 , in the second Super Bowl A stock ) , bespectacled man with heavy , blunt fea  --  tures  --  Robert Lipsyte , of the Times , once likened his teeth to a row of tombstones  --  Lombardi had played guard in the famous Fordham line of the middle nineteen-thirties called the Seven Blocks of Granite . He had slowly made his way up the coaching ladder : assistant and then head coach at a high school in New Jersey ( while simultaneously studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive coach of the varsity ; assistant coach for five years to Colonel Earl Blaik at West Point , as an of  --  fense specialist ; offensive coach for the New York Giants for five years ; then the call to Green Bay . Lombardi be  --  lieved in using a relatively small num  --  ber of offensive plays but executing them with such cohesive timing that the opposition could not stop them , even if it knew what plays made up the basis of the Packers ' attack . It should he added that the opposition seldom knew when to expect the various plays in the Green Bay repertoire , because Lombardi had in Bart Starr a quarter  --  back who as a play-caller , and as a passer and leader as well , has had only one equal in pro football in the postwar years  --  Johnny Unitas , of the Balti  --  more Colts . ( Graham was the peer of these two as an all-round force , hut , of course , Brown called the plays for the Browns . ) Lombardi , a direct , demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was also a " spirit guy , " but in a different way from the traditional model . He got his players aroused for their games by lambasting them verbally for their errors , from the first practice of the season to the last quarter of the last game . As Henry Jordan , a top Green Bay tackle , put it in his well-known description of the coach , " he treats us all the same  --  like dogs . " Why did the Green Bay players put up with Lombardi 's harsh outbursts and his other ex  --  cesses ? For one very good reason : they were absolutely con  --  vinced that he knew  --  and he did  --  what a team had to do , what it had to go through , in order to win the league championship . They were willing to t.rive him everything they had . Lombardi retired from coaching fol  --  lowing the Packers ' victory in the sec  --  ond Super Bowl . He rested a year , and then came hack as the coach and gen  --  eral manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had not had a winning season since 1955 . They did tinder Lombardi in his first year with them , 1969. just before the start of the next season , he died , at fifty-seven , of intestinal cancer . N the present time , there are twen  --  ty-six teams in the National Football League , and there will be two more in 1976 ? Tampa and Seattle . Given this considerable number of teams , you would expect that practical  --  ly the full gamut of coaching types would be represented in the league , and it is . Far example , there is a sizable new group of men who were unusual  --  ly successful college coaches  --  among them Dan Devine , from Missouri , now in his fourth year with the Packers ; John Ralston , from Stanford , in his third year with the Denver Broncos ; Chuck Fairbanks , from Oklahoma , who has rebuilt and revitalized the New England Patriots in two seasons ; and Don Coryell , from San Diego State , who has done a similarly splen  --  did job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only one Paul Brown , but there are lesser vet  --  erans of stature , such as Sid Gillman , of the Houston Oilers , who coached the Los Angeles Rams way back in the nineteen-fifties ; Tom Landry , the one and only coach of the Dallas Cowboys since that team was established , in 1960 ; and Hank Stram , the one and only coach of the Kansas City Chiefs since they came into existence , as the Dallas Texans of the old A.F.L. , also in 1960 . There are a good many men who began their coaching careers in pro ball as assistants and who , after earning increas ing respect around the league , were grabbed by other clubs and installed as head coach ? . es  --  to name a few , Chuck Noll , of the Pittsburgh Steel  --  ers ; Chuck Knox , of the Rams ; George Allen , of the Redskins ( who first attract  --  ed attention as Halas 's de  --  fensive specialist with the Bears ) ; and , preeminently , Don Shula , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Filling out the roster are several highly individual coaches , such as Tomm Prothro , a Life Mas  --  ter in contract bridge and a veteran tournament player , and Bud Grant , of the Minnesota Vikings , a self-possessed graduate of the Canadian Football League , who is so zealous about nut letting his job overwhelm the rest of his life that he has been known to rise before dawn and go duckhunting on many days during the height of the season . It would he an oversimplification to imply that the N.F.L. corps of coaches can he divided into two main genera  --  the quiet , cerebral types and the out  --  going , rah-rah types . I mention this because in the middle of this past sea  --  son , before I set out to observe two of the league coaches at close hand , I made a point of selecting two whose personalities offered a marked contrast . I chose Tom Landry , of the Dallas Cowboys , as typifying the scholar ! coach , and after thinking in terms of George Allen , I chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extrovert , the old " spirit guy. ? While I am a great admirer of Allen 's abilities , I veered away from him because he is rather an idiosyncratic fellow , and I was n't sure I would he sufficiently sympathetic to him . I found it difficult to get past one story about Allen I had been told several years ago by a friend who is in television and whose duties took him out to Los Angeles , where Allen was then head coach , to help with the telecast of one of the Rams ' games . Allen was kind enough to in  --  vite Min to dinner at his home , a handsome structure perched on high land near the Pacific  --  on a clear day you could see Catalina That evening , as Allen swung his car into the drive  --  way and his home came into view , my friend exclaimed , " What a beautiful house , George ! " Allen thanked him . " I was extremely explicit with the con  --  tractor , " he went on , very seriously " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . I do n't want a third-place house . I do n't want a second-place house . I want a championship house . ' You 're looking at a championship house . " Of all the teams in the N.F.L. , the Denver Broncos probably have the dis  --  tinction of being the least well known . It might not be going too far to sat that until 1972 , when Denver acquired Charley Johnson , the old St. Louis and Houston quarterback , most football fans who live cast of the headwaters of the Platte and the Arkansas could name only one man on the Denver roster  --  Floyd Little , the small , dura  --  ble , strong-hearted running hack who had gained a national reputation at Syracuse ' University before being draft  --  ed by the Broncos in 1967 . The main reason for this lack of knowledge about the Broncos is that from their estab  --  lishment , in 1960 , as a member of the A.F.L. until 1973 , their fourth year in the expanded N.F.L. , there was no season in which they won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they languished in the cellar of their division . Additionally , since they were placed in the Western Division by both the A.F.L. and the N.F.L. , they played only a small percentage of their games against Central and Eastern Di  --  vision teams . And , finally , since they failed to fire the imagination of most football fanatics , they were seldom se  --  lechd to appear on national television , which is the most effective means of making an impression in any sport . During the Broncos ' first dozen years , they ran through six coaches . A new era began for them in the winter of 1972 , with the signing of John Ralston , of Stanford , four days after his team had pulled off an upset victory in the Ruse Bowl for a second straight year . While everyone agreed that Ralston had a fine personality for coaching college football , there was a certain amount of apprehension in Denver during his first year over whether he would fare as well handling older and less compliant professional players . For one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest disciple of the Dale Carnegie school of human re  --  lationships , and had a habit of invaria  --  bly beginning his speeches with a warm smile and an expansive " A pleasant good afternoon to you all , " which did n't go down well with a lot of peo  --  ple . A good many of the Broncos also regarded Ralston as strictly a cornball type , and it was lucky for him that there were a few Floyd Utiles around to counsel their teammates , " 1 , Vell , let 's give him a chance and see what he can do . " Ralston 's first Denver team per  --  formed much better than its record  --  five victories in fourteen games -- would suggest , and the players learned to like and respect their coach . The next year , 1973 , the Broncos had their first winning season ever . After drop  --  ping three of their first four games , they rolled through the next seven without A loss , and , wonder of wonders , were in a position to qualify fur the playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scourge of their division , in the last game of the regular season . The Broncos lost , 21-17 , after a tre  --  mendous team effort . The pivotal play of the game was a fake punt by the Broncos that went for a one-yard loss . Oakland took over the ball , and then drove for the deciding touchdown . In the post-game session with the press in the locker room , a writer asked Ral  --  ston if he thought the fake punt was a good call . Ralston calmly said " No . " " Who called it ? " the writer asked . " I did , " Ralston said . " Would you make the same call again under the same circumstances ? " the writer persisted . " No , " Ralston said . As this incident brings out , Ralston makes it a point to accept the responsi  --  bility whenever something goes wrong . Conversely , he gives the credit to his assistants for whatever works out well . This practice is not exceptional a good many coaches make it a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tain other qualities of his , such as the perpetual enthusiasm and encourage  --  ment that issue from him during the progress of a game , no other contem  --  porary coach I know of is in the same class . I had caught a few snatches of Ralston in action on television , but I really did not begin to appreciate the extent to which he puts out until this past October , when I watched him during a home game against the New Orleans Saints in Mile High Stadium . First , however , let me digress briefly and tell you something about the Den  --  ver setup , for it is most agreeable . ( In  --  deed , Denver could easily become the Green Bay of the West . ) To begin with , the stadium , which doubles as the home of the Denver Bears baseball team , of the American Association , is situated about four miles from the Brown Palace Hotel and the state Capitol , the most famous landmarks in this city of approximately half a mil  --  lion people  --  one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old  --  fashioned-looking structure with a tri  --  ple-deck west stand , a large , single-deck east stand , and single-deck stands behind the two end zones . Its present capacity is 51,706 , and every home game for four years has been a sellout . With the recent rise in the Broncos ' fortunes , the people in the Denver area , who had supported the team faithfully through its long stretch of dispiriting seasons , voted a twenty-five  --  million-dollar bond issue this past Sep  --  tember which will enable the city and the county , which own the stadium , to add twenty-five thousand scats A strange combination of sights confronts the visitor to Mile High Stadium . From the triple-deck stand , he sees in the dis  --  tance ( to the cast ) the congestion of tall , oblong sh scrapers that have gone up in the last dozen years in Denver , as they have in so many of our cities , and that give it the aspect of a jayvee ( The snow-tapped front ranges of the Rockies are to the west . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stadium and in the stands sur  --  rounding it , the flavor is informal and unself-consciously Western . On this occasion , the first word spelled out on the field by the hand from Colorado State University , the Marching Rams , was " Howdy . " Hanging over the sta  --  dium walls was a gallimaufry of home  --  made banners , such as " A Little Goes a Long Way , " saluting the Broncos ' popular backfield star ; " The Broncos Are Walking Tall for Paul , " a ref  --  erence to Paid Smith , the team 's best defensive lineman , who was out for the season with an injury ; and " Go , Orange , Crush , " which makes more sense when one knows that one of the Broncos ' colors is burnt orange . ( The others are white and Academy blue , which is the official color of the Air Force Academy , fifty miles south of Denver . ) Along the edge of the field , tuning up the responsive crowd , were sixteen Bronco Belles , outfitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue pompons . On the gridiron , the Broncos and the Saints were going through their pregame workouts . It was a comparatively balmy day , and Ralston , a man of forty-seven who looks like a somewhat chunkier and slightly less handsome Glenn Ford , was bareheaded and clad only in a light-blue team polo shirt and a pair of dark-blue trousers . He held a clipboard in his hand . During the thirty-minute warmup , he stood on the seven-yard line while the squad went through some calisthenics . Then , as various units executed their special drills , he moved around , scrutinizing individual players , and he kept mov  --  ing . is the offensive and defensive teams ran through a few fundamental plays . About twenty minutes before game time , the Denver and New Or leans squads trotted to their locker rooms , in the stand behind the south end zone . Some fifteen minutes later , the Saints ' offensive team was intro  --  duced , man by man , over the public-address system , following which the rest of the squad streamed onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " special teams " ? the kicking and kick return teams were introduced , partly as a reward for their work in the vic  --  tory over Kansas City the previous Sunday , and partly because Ralston is careful to see that the non-stars receive their fair share of attention . Then the rest of the Broncos came bursting out of the locker room and dashed through a gantlet formed by two lines of Bron  --  co Belles . This was quite a sight , for at their head , running with a slight wad  --  dle but maintaining his front position in the sprint to the fifty-yard line despite the encumbrance of his clipboard , was Ralston . I have seen no other coach do this . During the simulated toss of the coin  --  the real toss had already taken place , and this one was just for tele  --  vision  --  Ralston , as is his habit , was out on the field with his players between the forty- and thirty-yard lines , slap  --  ping a few behinds at random and checking some final details with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting in place of the injured Chat-icy Johnson . Thirty sec  --  onds before the kickoff , Ralston was still out on the field , smack in the mid  --  dle of the Broncos ' last huddle , until they broke it and moved to their posi  --  tions . I have seen no other coach do this , either . During a game , Ralston , except when he is studying the play in prog ress on the field , is constant ly in movement . In the course of the New Orleans game , he spent a good deal of his time , as he usually does , with five of his assistant coaches , who were ranged along the west sideline . ( The two oth ers were up in the press box phoning down observations and suggestions . ) In addition , to list just a few of his sideline activities , Ralston talked over tactics , presumably , with Pete Duranko , a vet eran tackle ; slapped Ray May , his mid dle linebacker , across the shoulder after May had made a good open-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideline pass by Ramsey was intercept ed by a New Orleans cornerback , who ran it in for a touchdown that put the visitors momentarily ahead 10-7 ; had an appreciative word for Otis Arm strong , a young running back with colossal potential ; spent several minutes checking on an offensive lineman who had been shaken up ; ran far down the sideline to congratulate Ramsey and Riley Odours , the tight end , who had teamed up on a crisp pass play that went for a touchdown ; consoled Jim Turner , his placekicker , who had missed the extra point after the next Denver touchdown ( his first miss , by the way , after two hundred and twen ty-one consecutive conversions ) ; had several chats with Charley Johnson , whom lie admires enormously , not only because Johnson has earned his doctor ate in chemical engineering as a spe cialist in rheology but also because he has had the guts to go through five knee operations and three shoulder op erations during fourteen seasons in the league ; had a smile and a word of praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle ; squatted down and went over some general points with his left cornerback , who had been beaten cold on two pass plays and was obvious ly feeling low ; had a slap on the back for two of the best players on his de fensive team , Bill Thompson , the strong safety , and Lyle Alzado , the right end ; was the first man to congratulate Billy Van Heusen , a wide re  --  ceiver , who had pulled in a pass from Ramsey on a forty-three-yard touch  --  down play that just about wrapped things up . The final score was Den  --  ver 33 , New Orleans 17 . Ralston , though he is nowhere near as agitated during a game as George Allen , who is more fidgety than a third-base coach , was constantly making nervous ges  --  tures  --  wiping his forehead with a finger , clapping his hands , rubbing a hand across his mouth , massaging the nape of his neck . He carried his clip  --  board the entire game but made hardly more use of it than Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the side  --  line with the movement of the ball , on this Sunday he did noth  --  ing that compared to his spectacular reaction to a burst around end by Little at Yankee Stadium two years ago , when he raced jubilantly down the sideline stride for stride with Little to the goal line . Ral- ston 's unique style of coaching during a game is possible only because , with ev- erything tidily organized , he can turn over a good deal of responsibility to his aides . " When I was starting out coach- ing in high school , I tried to do every- thing , " he told me later on in my stay in Denver . " I tried to direct the offen- sive and defensive units , the kicking units  --  to carry the whole burden . When I moved up to the college level , I continued to do this for a number of years , but then I gradually realized you could n't . I began to delegate more and more duties , to leave myself free to worry about only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll do in all kicking situations ; two , to keep track of the combinations of scores , so that I know , for example , when it might be unwise to settle for a field goal ; three , to note certain changes we should make in our offensive and defensive strat- egies at halftime ; and , four , to act as sort of a cheerleader , to keep the in- dividual players up . I guess that 's prob- ably the most important thing I do . " Ralston met the press after the game in his stadium office , a small , white- walled room with a blue carpet , just off the locker room . He sipped a steam- ing cup of black coffee as he went into a general review of the game in a fairly relaxed manner  --  most of the tension of the afternoon had already slipped away . " We were pretty rag- ged , " he said . " Pretty ragged . No snap at all . It 's nice to win , but we 've got a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , position football . Today , we did n't get the sustained ground game you need to be successful in this busi  --  ness . " He took a long sip of coffee and began fielding specific questions . After Ralston had showered and changed , he drove to his home , on the south side of the city , and had supper with his wife , Patty , and their daugh  --  ter Terry , who works for the local Dale Carnegie branch . Their two other children arc away from home : Sherry , Terry 's twin , is married and lives in San Diego , and their son , Larry , attends the University of Colo  --  rado , in Boulder . Mrs. Ralston , by the way , works at a local methadone clinic . Most coaches are so worn out after a game that they simply take it easy . After all , the next morning they will have to start preparing for the coming Sun  --  day 's game . Ralston is a little dif  --  ferent here , too . At eight-thirty ' after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his house , and the driver delivers the films of that afternoon 's game . They are broken down into three reels : the Broncos ' of  --  fensive plays , their defensive plays , and the special teams ' plays . Ralston studies them on his projector until he can no longer keep his eyes open , and then gropes his way to bed . On Monday mornings , he usually gets up at four  --  some of the strain remains , and it is hard to sleep  --  and continues to study the films until six . He heads for his office then . He is the only coach know of who starts work on Sunday night for next Sunday 's game . This energetic , driving man was born on April 26 , 1927 , in Oakland , California , not long before his family moved to the small town of Norway , in northern Michigan . At the age of eleven , he knew he wanted to be a football coach , and it is hard to conceive of a career running in a straighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California at Berke  --  ley , where he majored in physical education , he played linebacker on two Cal teams , coached by Lynn Waldorf , that went to the Rose Bowl . After graduating , he coached at high schools in the Bay Area for five years , re  --  turned to Cal as an assistant for three years , then became head coach at Utah State , where his teams , manned by such brontosaurs as Merlin Olsen and Lionel Aldridge , won thirty-one , lost eleven , and tied one during his four-year regime . The next year , 1963 , he took over as head coach at Stanford , and there , after a losing first season , his teams , using a wide-open , pro-style offense , went on to eight straight win  --  ning seasons . During the last two 1970 and 1971 ? Stanford finally won the Pacific Eight Conference title and made it to the Rose Bowl . On New Year 's Day , 1971 , however , Stanford was given little , if any , chance against a big , burly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a seesaw battle until the final period , when Jim Plunkett , Stanford 's redoubtable quarterback , who completed twenty passes in all , drove his team to two touchdowns and an astonish  --  ing 27-17 victory . The 1972 Rose Bowl game followed a somewhat simi  --  lar script . A powerful Michigan team , a heavy favorite , rushed for nearly three hundred yards that afternoon , but Stanford , relying on a passing attack directed by Don Bunco , managed to stay in the game . With three minutes of playing time left and the teams locked at 10-10 , the issue seemed settled when Michigan scored a safety , but Stanford would n't stay down . Bunco got a drive rolling from his own twenty-two-yard line , and , with the help of five completions in a row , reached the Michigan fourteen-yard line with fourteen seconds to go . Rod Garcia then kicked a clutch field goal , which made the final score Stanford 13 , Michigan 12 . It was a remarkable triumph of heart for the team and for Ralston . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good part of my time in the Broncos ' offices , which occupy a one-story building across the street from the team 's practice field , about four miles from the center of town . During my stay , I never ceased to he amazed by Ralston 's verve , whether he was directing practice in an Italian-tenor , deep-from-the-diaphragm bel  --  low , which he employs in order to save his speaking voice , or ad-libbing into a Code-A-Phone machine some inside hatter about the team , which is avail  --  able fresh dads to any sportswriters and sportscasters who merell dial the phone number , or dictating ten to twenty-five letters a day , or rushing from a team workout in his windbreak-r and practice pants to address the weekly luncheon of the Quarterback Club . His only relaxation seemed to he games of racquet-hall doubles , which he played around six o'clock each night with some of his coaches in the courts recently added to the office building . But this was a false impression . Ral  --  ston also relaxes , as Atilai Stevenson did , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pure football or the incalculable part that motivation plays in football and all of life 's games . This stress on motivation hardly comes as a surprise to anyone who has visited his office . A small or  --  ange-colored can on his desk bears the inscription " Success Comes in Cans , Not in Cannots . " A hand-printed card beside his telephone states his goal ; " Go To and Win the Super Bowl . " ( Sim  --  ilar cards are attached to the window visor of his car and to his bathroom mirror at home . ) In the storage space beneath a wall shelf are five cases of tapes and notebooks that were used mainly in five Dale Carnegie courses he has taken over the past ten years . ( Ralston is now a certified Carnegie instructor . I " The whole point in learn  --  ing how to have better human relation  --  ships is to increase your own under  --  standing and confidence , " he said to me one day . " All of us can use more confidence , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finesse . Down on the field , it can he as physical as a street fight . A team has to feel like a team . It has got to believe that it has been better prepared for each game than the other team . It 's up to the coach to provide this preparation and to supply the motivation that gets his play  --  ers ready to produce a top perform  --  ance . Every coach goes about that a somewhat different way . Basically , what he is after is attitude . Attitude  --  a-t-t-i-t-u-d-e . That 's the magic word . " He smiled a moment as his eye caught a framed photograph on the wall of a polar bear leaning a sleepy head on a block of ice , above the leg  --  end " Act enthusiastic and you 'll be enthusiastic . " " As is pretty obvious , I 've been a self-improvement nut all my life , " Ralston continued . " That , of course , is why I got into the Dale Carnegie program . It helps a coach a heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth with the individual play  --  ers . Gosh , football has changed . When I was a player , you could tell a boy to run through a brick wall and he would . Today , you 're coaching individuals , and you do n't coach an athlete , you coach a mind . Well , as I was saying , on can always learn  --  which is why I arranged last spring for myself , the coaching staff , and six men on our ad  --  ministrative staff to take a fourteen-week course with the Denver repre  --  sentative of S.M.I. That stands for Success Motivation Institute . It 's an organization , with headquarters in Waco , whose approach is to teach mem  --  bers of a company  --  say , people in the sales division  --  the dynamics of per  --  sonal leadership . To achieve things , ac  --  cording to S.M.I. , you must have a goal-setting program . You must write down those goals . Visualization must precede the doing . Oh , I 'm sold on S.M.I. and its credo : ' Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , and enthusiastically act on must inevitably come to pass . ' " I liked Ralston very much . I say this because , for some reason , I do n't usually take to persons who are im  --  mersed in Dale Carnegie or some ide  --  ology like S.M.I. 's . As I thought things over , it seemed to me that the reason found Ralston so appealing is that there is a lot more to him than the hardworking coach and the ardent self-improver . I could picture him as a kindly , capable , genuinely dedicated country doctor . I am not sure , but that image may have dropped into my mind because of a story that the Broncos ' two public-re  --  lations men , Bob Peck and Dick Maxwell , told me about how Ralston had acted after the 1973 Pittsburgh game , in Pittsburgh , in which the standout Denver tackle Mary Mont  --  gomery suffered a terrible broken leg  --  both the tibia and fibula smashed . After the game , Ralston rushed to the hos  --  pital and was present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de  --  departure of the chartered plane the team was travelling in , and ordered a row of seats to he removed on one side of the center aisle , so that there would he ample room for Montgomery to stretch out his leg and rest it com  --  fortably . There was no way that plane was going to return to Denver without Montgomery on it . IN a large outer office that leads to the private offices of Curt Mosher , the Dallas Cowboys ' public-relations director , and Doug Todd , his assistant , a small radio plays country-and-West  --  ern songs all day long . Mosher and Todd are very keen on this type of mu  --  sic , but it would he wrong to deduce from this that they are two good old boys from the outback who are lost the moment they get north of the chicken  --  fried-steak sector . One of the best in  --  dexes of this is the kick they get out of collecting and savoring lyrics that epit  --  omize the lush strain of sentimentality found in country-and-Western music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sundown does to you . " " How much more can she stand and still stand by me ? " " I bought the shoes that just walked out on me . " The entire Cowboys ' organization , for that mat  --  ter , is one of the least provincial in the N.F.L. , and has been since the league awarded Dallas its franchise . It is ap  --  propriate that the club 's headquarters are on the eleventh floor of a sleek fif  --  teen-story office building called the Ex  --  pressway Tower , on the North Central Expressway , about five miles north of downtown Dallas , which is now dense with slab-shaped skyscrapers , and about five miles south of the new L.B.J. Ex  --  pressway , which , when it is completed , will encircle this sprawling city . When a visitor gets off the elevator on the eleventh floor of the Expressway Tow  --  er , he is confronted by a three-dimen  --  sional mural with the words " Dallas Cowboys Football Club " in raised white letters on a royal-blue back  --  ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white circles , raised red squares , and chromed-metal tithes arranged to simulate a diagrammed football play  --  a power sweep to the right , 4n1% on which the ballcarrier , designated by a red arrow , points down a Icing , blue-carpeted cor  --  ridor toward the receptionist 's desk . The building , by the way  --  a fact that is hardly surprising , considering the reach and diversity of his interests  --  is owned by Clint Murchison , Jr. , who also is the principal owner of the Coy , - boys . The office at the southwest corner of the Cowboys ' floor has floor-to-ceil  --  ing windows providing a fine view of Southern Methodist University , just across the expressway . This office is oc  --  cupied by Tom Landry , now in his fifteenth eat- as the Cowboys ' coach . The picture of Landry that most peo  --  ple have is the one that has met their gaze so frequently whenever they have watched the Cowboys on television . A long face , usually shaded by a Rex Harrison-type tweed hat set straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pression never change 's . The eyes arc sunk so deep that one can hardly see the pupils . The mouth is a thin , straight line . The chin juts way out . Landry 's " game face , " as it has come to be called , conjures up different images for different people . A friend of mine , for example , thinks of it as the tragic mask that balances the comic mask of John  --  ny Carson , to whom Landry bears a considerable Facial resemblance . To me , its brooding intensity has alway s sug  --  gested a portrait Rembrandt might have done entitled , say , " Spice Mer  --  chant from Alkmaar , " with the added explanation that the merchant had just received news that all his ships had been lost at sea . Since I had previous  --  ly seen Landry only On television or through a pair of binoculars , I hardly recognized him when I met him at a press luncheon on a mid-season trip I made to Dallas . The absence of strain totally altered his features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , no longer had that em  --  hedded look , and I could see that they were blue . Now fifty years old , he is getting bald and his sideburns are gray , but he looked much younger and far more handsome than I had expected . ( He also seemed much taller . I had never realized that he is about six-two . ) When he spoke to the three dozen assembled writers and broad  --  casters , his manner was light and there was a twinkle in his eye . This was the eighth week of the season , and on Sunday the Cowboys would he playing their second game against the Cardinals , who were still undefeated . When Landry was asked what he planned to do to stop Terry Metcalf , the Cardinals ' wonderful young back , who had run several Dallas kickoffs back for enormous yardage in the first game , he said with a little laugh , " Maybe we can make a deal with the Cards whereby they just take over at their forty-yard line on kickoffs . " Landry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion about it . He believes that it results not from tension hut , rather , from trying to sustain a high pitch of concentration . " My job during a game is to help the team all I can , " he said when we talked one day . " There are a lot of things to watch for , to think about , and to cor  --  rect as rapidly as possible . That re  --  quires every last hit of attention and knowledge I can muster . " ( Accord  --  ing to Gil Brandt , the Cowboys ' vice-president for personnel development , Landry sometimes gets so deeply in  --  volved in a game that " I 've heard him call for players we have n't had for two years . " ) It is Landry 's opinion that although he may not look it , he is actually fairly relaxed during a game  --  much more relaxed than he is on Mon  --  day , Tuesday , and Wednesday , when he is working on the game plan for the next Sunday . The members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first three days of the week , Torn may pass you in the corridor without saying a word , " Al Ward , the vice-president for administration , says . " He does n't even see you . On Thurs  --  day or Friday , he 's liable to greet you warmly and slap you across the hack . " When Landry is preoccupied , his stand  --  ard response to any routine question or piece of news is a barely audible " O.K. , " uttered with a rising inflec  --  tion . " He 's always very brief at those times , " Curt Mosher told me , with a smile . " During the 1968 pre-season , to give you an example , the trainer tele  --  phoned in to report that Bob Lilly had a slight leg injury , which the Coach had n't been told about . I found Tom in his office engaged in a serious dis  --  cussion with six of his assistants . When I relayed the report , he just lowered his reading glasses and said in a flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron East , one of our backup tackles . For Tom , that covered every  --  thing . " Later in my stay , I had the opportunity to talk about Landry with Tex Schramm , the club 's president and general manager . " Torn is not an easy man to read , " he said . " For example , he 's a very emotional person , but the way he conducts himself , he does n't al  --  low it to show . Another thing , he 's a very confident person . That has helped us immeasurably . For a large number of reasons , the Cow  --  boys , as you know , have been one of the glamour teams of the post  --  war era , along with the old Rams , the Giants of the late fifties and early sixties , and the Packers under Lom  --  bardi . Few people , however , seem to remember the many severe disappoint  --  ments the Cowboys suffered through before they won the Super Bowl at the end of the 1971 season . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith we have in him , that en  --  abled the team to pull itself off the floor after those disheartening blows and come back with renewed purpose . " The story of Landry and the Cow  --  boys  --  and a fascinating one it is  --  really begins in 1952 , when Murchi  --  son , who had always wanted to own a professional football team , made an attempt to acquire the moribund Dal  --  las Texans of the N.F.L. but was stymied , because the league had al  --  ready reached an agreement with a Baltimore group to take over the franchise . ( The Baltimore group later renamed the team the Colts . ) Despite the fact that Murchison had neither the size nor the sinew of his classmates , he had played end on the Lawrence  --  ville team before going on to Duke and from there to M.I.T. , where he earned his degree in electrical engineer  --  ing . Back in Dallas , he got into foot  --  ball again when his two older sons were growing up and he began coach  --  ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League . The game meant a lot to him . After being re  --  pulsed in his effort to buy the Texans , he tried , also unsuccessfully , to buy the Washington Redskins and then the San Francisco 49ers . His chance came at last in 1959 , when the N.F.L. an  --  nounced that it would he expanding the next year , and subsequently in  --  formed Murchison that it regarded with favor an application made by his syndicate to establish a new team in Dallas . The first man hired by Murchi  --  son was Schramm , whose job was to put the team together and run it . Down through the years , Murchisonhas always made himself available to Schramm for consultation , but in re  --  cent times he has taken a leading role in only one of the club 's projects the building of its new home , Texas Sta  --  dium , in nearby Irving . One of Mur  --  chison 's construction outfits entered a bid on the job and got the con  --  tract . Murchison himself conceived the plan of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leather seats for the press box and the small Sony television set between every two seats . Texas Stadium is unique in that its outside wall tilts inward at the top , covering the stands but leaving an area of some two and a quarter acres above the playing field open to the sky . This design , besides protecting the pa  --  trons from rain and from sun glare , preserves the outdoor character of an outdoor sport . One of the few N.F.L. stadiums not built by city , county , or state funds  --  it was financed basically by the team 's season-ticket holders  --  Texas Stadium is the finest football facility I have ever seen . ( I should per haps add that I have not been to the new Arrowhead Stadium , the home of the Kansas City Chiefs , who are owned by Lamar Hunt , another well-to-do Texan and an old friend of Murchi  --  son 's . ) Schramm , the man who has guided the growth of the Cowboys , is re  --  garded as one of the ablest adminis  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the publicity di  --  rector and the general manager of the Los Angeles Rams , and then had left the game to become assistant director of sports at CBS . ( His full name is Texas Edward Schramm . His grand  --  father , who emigrated from Germany to the hill country north of San An  --  tonio , fell so deeply in love with Texas that he named his son after the state ; the son , who became a broker in San Gabriel , California , passed the name on to his son , who , for his part , chose to go to college at the University of Texas . ) As Schramm set to work building the Cowboys , the leading can  --  didate he had in mind as a possible coach was Sid Gillman , whom he had known when they were both with the Rams . The man who suggested Lan  --  dry was Paul Corley , an aide to Toddie Lee Wynne , Jr. , still another well-to-do Texan , who is an investor in the Cowboys . Corley had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas , where they were both active in the Sunday-school program . In those days , Landry , a native Texan , was still associated with the New York Giants as their highly esteemed defensive coach , but football then took up only six months of a person 's time , and dur  --  ing the off-season Landry and his family regularly returned to Texas . Schramm , of course , knew a good deal about Landry to begin with . He made further inquiries about him , met with him several times on trips to New York , and then signed him as the Cowboys ' coach right after the Giants had lost the 1959 N.F.L. champion  --  ship game . " Nobody in football has ever questioned Tom 's knowledge of the sport , then or now , " Schramm told inc . " As everyone knows , he was the first man to take a defensive unit and turn it into the tiara . Yankee Stadi  --  um  --  that was the first place where the crowds set up the chant of Mee-fense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fensive unit had done its stuff and stopped a chive , that huge roar of ap  --  plause rose from the stands . But , equal  --  ly important , I felt that Tom had the personal qualities that we could count on over the long pull . After my years with the Rams , where the constant bickering among the owners had been very destructive , I appreciated the val  --  ue of having continuity on a team . Un  --  less people know they 're going to he a part of tomorrow , you ca n't expect them to think in long-range terms . " Landry was born and grew up in Mission , a small town at the head of the Rio Grande Valley , eighty miles northwest of Brownsville  --  a district that produces citrus fruits and winter vegetables . His father , a mechanic who ran his own garage , was the chief of the town 's volunteer fire department for forty years before retiring , in 1973 . Landry , who looks hack on his boy  --  hood in Mission with immense affec  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the Univer  --  sity of Texas , but in the spring of his freshman year-1943 ? he enlisted in the Army Air Forces . He got his wings as a B-17 pilot at nineteen , and flew thirty missions over Germany and Ger  --  man-occupied Europe . After the war , Landry returned to the University of Texas and football . He switched to fullback , and in his senior year he en-captained the team . He was signed by the New York Yankees of the A.A.F.C and played cornerback for them . When the league folded , after the 1949 season , Landr ) and most of the other players in the Yankees ' de  --  fensive backfield ended up with the New York Giants The Giants were coached at that time , as they had been since 1931 , by Steve Owen , a master of defensive football . In 1950 , the sea  --  son the Giants played their first game against the Browns , who had trans  --  ferred to the N.F.L. after the demise of the A.A.F.C. , Owen came up with something special to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the standard 5-2 pro defense of five linemen and two linebackers supplemented by four deep backs  --  the so-called Eagle Defense , since it had been developed by Earl ( Greasy ) Neale , the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles -- Owen surprised the Browns by coming tip with a 6-1 defense : six men on the line , including two ends , who rushed on some plays and dropped hack on others to help the single linebacker . Behind this front wall were four defen  --  sive backs , including Landry , ar  --  rayed in a wide arc that came to he known as the umbrella defense . The Browns were badly confused by Owen 's revolutionary alignment  --  and in particular by the two mobile ends , rushing the passer on one down , slid  --  ing out into the flat on the next . In the first half , the Browns ' celebrated Otto Graham did n't complete a single pass . He did n't do much better in the second half , and for the first time in history the Browns were shut out . When Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Lee Howell , recognizing Landry 's penchant for analytical probing , appointed him a player-coach . Landry continued in this double role for two years  --  in the first , 1954 , he was named to the All-Pro team  --  making up for his lack of speed by shrewd position play . By studying an opposing team 's offense on films , he learned to anticipate what plays were coming up by spotting certain keys in the different formations . After the 1955 season , he retired as an active player and became the Giants ' defen  --  sive coach  --  a position he held until he went with Dallas . It was during the four years he was a full-time coach with the Giants that Landry devised the 4-3 defense , which soon became the standard pro defense , and still is . " The 4-3 derives , of course , from Steve Owen 's 6-1 , " Landry said when he was clarifying its origin for me . " It became obvious to the other teams jored in offense , are sold on the thesis that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de  --  fense . Consequently , when Landry took over at Dallas the football cog  --  noscenti , knowing his background , looked for him to devote the hulk of his attention to establishing a solid , savvy defensive unit and to settle , at least temporarily , for a skeletal offense . It did n't work out that way . First , the Cowboys ' defense yielded a very high number of paints until their sixth sea  --  son , 1965 , by which time Landry had assembled the personnel he needed to make his system work . Second , instead of installing uncomplicated , th ree-yards-and  --  a-cloud-of-dust offense , he chose to go with the most intricate at  --  tack possible  --  a Metro-Gold wyn  --  Mayer amalgam of slot formations , double and triple wings , I formations , and several other formations , which , quite logically , came to be called the multiple offense . According to Erma ! Allen , who has headed up the club 's research-and-development department since 1962 , the Cowboys today employ five basic offensive formations : the I ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Brown ( with both backs set to the weak side ) ; the Red ( a split backfield with the fullback set to the strong side ) ; the Green ( a split backfield with the halfback set to the strong side ) ; and the Blue ( with both backs set to the strong side ) . From these five formations , sixty or more variations are possible . Sometimes the Cowboys go on a quick count , sometimes after one shift , sometimes after a shift in which a flanker or a running back goes in motion , and sometimes after a second shift . This Byzantine offense , which at first look seems so out of character for Landry , is n't at all when he explains his reasons For creating it : " At the time the Cow  --  boys joined the N.F.L. , most of the teams in the league had adopted the 4-3 and were emphasizing defense . Having spent so much time myself on the 4-3 , I realized that the basis of its effectiveness was recognition  --  recog  --  nizing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up and then making your defensive ad  --  justments . My thinking went like this : If this is the case , let 's keep the other team from recognizing eta , . offensive intentions . We 'll show them one for  --  mation , and while they 're adjusting their defense to it , we 'll shift into a different formation and run our play before they can even start to re  --  adjust . " By 1962 , their third season , the Cowboys were one of the three top offensive teams in the league , and their 1966 team stands as one of the most explosive in football history . On the other hand , the multiple offense has certain inherent difficulties . While man like Calvin Hill , with an ex  --  ceptionally good mind , can learn the system in One 3 ear f " It 's something like calculus , " Hill said one day after practice . " If you know why one thing is happening , you can figure out the other things " ) , this type of offense is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with a simplified attack . As much as anything else , this explains why the Cowboys have tradi  --  tionally been very much like the little girl with the little curl right in the middle of her forehead . When they have been good , they have looked like the Rolls-Royce of football , and when they have been had , they have stuttered and stalled like an old Chalmers . In  --  deed , one of the recurrent problems for Landry has been finding a quarterback who , in his opininy , could correctly e  --  ploit the many options afforded 173 the multiple offense . His solution has often been to alternate two men in that po  --  sition --  Eddie LeBaron and the very talented but emotionally ornate Don Meredith , Meredith and Craig Mor  --  ton , and Morton and Roger Stall-bath , the team 's present regular qual  --  terback , who is that rare anomaly , a man of brimming self-confidence and courage who lacks the fundamental qualities of leadership . Most of the ears , whatever the situation at quar  --  terback , Landry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most significant achieve  --  ment has not been the building of some superb two-way teams but , as Schramm has intimated , his holding the Cow  --  boys together during the protracted period when they incurred a succession of traumatic defeats unmatched in the history of professional football . In 1966 , when the team had at length coalesced , it went all the way to the N.F.L. championship game only to lose to the Packers in the final minute , 34-27 . ( With 1:58 to go , the Cow  --  boys had a first down on the Packers ' two-Yard line but failed to score . ) In 1967 , in the famous Ice Bowl game , they again lost to the Packers in the final minute , 21-17 . ( With time for only one play left , Starr , behind a block by Jerry Kramer , dived into the end atone for the winning touchdown . ) The Cowboys expected their turn to come the following season , but they did n't even reach the championship game , committing error after error against the Browns in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought an even more humiliating defeat in the Eastern Conference playoff : on paper much the superior team , the Cowboys were pushed all over hy the Browns , 38-14 . In 1970 , the first year in which the teams previously in the American Football League were fully incorporated into the N.F.L. , the Cowboys , after winning two dose games to take the National Confer  --  ence playoffs  --  in the new setup , the teams were now divided into six divi  --  sions , three in each of the confer  --  ences  --  met Baltimore , the American Conference champions , in Super Bowl V. There they maintained their rep  --  utation for blowing the important games by losing this one , 16-13 , on a last-minute field goal by Jim O'Brien , after they had thoroughly outplayed the Colts . What a tale of travail ! Through it all , Landry some  --  how had the stuff to gather himself to- I gether after each disappointment and to reknit the confidence of the players in themselves and the team . ( His hard  --  est moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , after ? talking with his coaching staff in the locker room , he asked them to leave , and spent seven or eight minutes by himself trying to think things through . ) At last , in 1971 , the Cowboys made it . They defeated Minnesota and San Francisco in the National Conference playoffs to reach the Super Bowl again , and there they defeated the Miami Dolphins , 24-3 . It was historically fit  --  ting that when the Cowboys finally won their first championship , they did ii by playing the perfect Bowl game . After that success , there was talk that perhaps a Dallas dynasty had begun , but in 1972 and 1973 , white they had good seasons , on each occasion the Cowboys lost the game that would have put them in the Super Bowl .

" If he has a major weakness , it may be that he is overpatient with peo  --  ple and circumstances and , as a result , takes too long to make some decisions . Of his many strong points , one of the most admirable is the continuous effort he makes to maintain some proportion in his life . For example , he insists on having breakfast each morning , even during the football season , with his wife , Alicia , and those of their chil  --  dren ( they have three ) who happen to he at home . He relaxes during the off-season by fishing ( he is a very competitive angler ) , by playing golf ( his low round last year was a 73 ) , and by working with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes ( he is current  --  ly the chairman of the hoard of trus  --  tees of the National Ear ) , ) . For all this , it is quite probable that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football during the course of a year than Landry . THIS year , when the Cowboys lost four of their first five games , all by narrow margins , it looked as if their record of reAching the playoffs eight straight seasons were surely coming to an end . Then they turned things around and won six of their next seven games , including a storybook victory over ? Vashington in the last twenty-eight seconds on Thanksgiv  --  ing Day . At this writing  --  halfway through the thirteenth week of the fourteen-week season  --  they still have an outside shot of gaining the " wild-card , " or last-qualification , spot in the National Conference . The Broncos also got off to a bad start , winning only one of their first four games . Ralston , with his esprit and fibre , managed to regroup his forces , and got them play  --  ing some exciting offensive football , climaxed by a gritty , come-from-be  --  hind victory over Detroit on Thanks  --  giving Day . Four days later , however , they were mathematically eliminated from the championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . What a hunch-up we have had this season ! Oakland , Los Angeles , Minnesota , and St. Louis have already clinched four of the eight playoff places that lead to the Super Bowl , but at the moment no fewer than eight other teams are still eligible for the remaining four places , and we may not know who is in and who is out until the last day of the regular season , December 15th . I am making plans to drive up to New Haven some  --  time the week after that so that I can commune with the shades of Walter and Alice Camp , discuss the various coaches of the teams who have made the playoffs , and get a little perspective on these difficult matters . ?
