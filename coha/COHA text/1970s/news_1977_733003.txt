txt Things seem to be looking up for Avis Inc , the self-proclaimed hard-trying No. 2 of the car rental business . Earnings in 1976 set a record for the company : the stock price at $14.50 a share is double what it was a couple of years ago and , after a gap of 24 months , common stock dividends have been resumed This could mean that at long last the way is almost clear to sell to the public the nearly half of the corporation 's outstanding common stock that is held in court-ordered trusteeship . A more conventional ownership arrangement will be a relief to everybody connected with the company For much of its 21 years , Avis has been bouncing around among a variety of owners  --  first , its founder , Warren Avis ; then , Lazard Freres , the New York investment banking firm ; next International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . In 1971 , ITT as part of the Hartford Fire antitrust settlement agreed to divest Avis by 1975 . But it was unable to find a buyer for the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in the hands of Richard Joyce Smith , a 73-year-old attorney whom the - Hartford federal court appointed as a trustee . A Hitch or Two However , there are a few complications that may have to be unraveled before the 48% of Avis shares now in trusteeship can be sold One is the disclosure last November by an audit committee of three outside directors that Avis had made $425,000 in ? Improper , facilitating or otherwise questionable " payments . The Avis board turned the whole-confidential report over to the Securities and Exchange Commission and made parts of ' the report available to other regulatory and law enforcement agencies Shortly after this disclosure , Winston V Morrow , Avis 's 52-year-old chairman and chief executive , resigned for reasons never publicly explained either by him or the company . Late last week , Avis felt the need to issue a more detailed breakdown of the $425,000 , noting that its two " management directors " had knowledge of , some of the payments and off-book funds . It said that directors had taken " appropriate action with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , no further personnel action is warranted as a result of the audit committee 's findings . " The two management directors were Mr. MorrOw and Colin M. Marshall , Avis President who succeeded Mr. Morrow as chief executive . Mr. Marshall , 43 , a personable , soft-spoken ex-Hertz man , formerly was in charge of European operations and is given much-of the credit for making Avis the No. 1 car rental agency in Europe , outstripping its bigger rival , Hertz , by a good margin . A Missing Item The Avis supplementary disclosure stated that $384,000 of the questionable payments were made abroad from funds generated by foreign subsidiaries . Missing from the report , however , was any mention of another payment  --  a single check for $470,958 ? about which , it has been learned , the SEC has been questioning Avis . The check was - paid on Feb. 3 , 1975 , to a short-lived " shell " company , called Arbourage Financial Consultants , located on the tax haven of Jersey in the Channel Islands off the coast of France . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lists a long tabulation of consultations and other services . Coincidence or not , within a few days of the payment , Italy reinterpreted its Industrial Credit Plan to allow Avis to take tax deductions , retroactive to 1968 . These deductions were related to its annual outlays for new cars , regardless of whether the purchases increased the size of the fleet or not The result was a windfall for Avis , freeing tax reserves , bringing in some $4.5 million in tax credits and allowing the company to apply about $3 7 million to net income figures for 1974 and 1975 . Coming Just a few days before Arthur Andersen &; Co the company 's auditor , closed the books for 1974 , the ruling enabled Avis to salvage something from what had been a very bad year . As it was , Avis reported net for 1974 of only $4 million , or 64 cents a common share , down from $11.3 million or 81.89 a share in 1973 . A Coup for Mr. Marshall The windfall was no secret among Avis executives and was considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had negotiated it for several months from Garden City , where it was , generally understood among top management that Avis had agreed to pay 10% of any proceeds from the tax change in some form of commission or fee . Yet Avis stockholders have never been informed of the nature of the windfall , except for a footnote reference in the company 's annual reports to small gains from ' reversals in foreign biz regulations . " Moreover , there is no indication that anything more than a perfunctory examination of the payment was made by Avis 's blue-ribbon audit committee , made up of Robert W. Haack , former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange , Robert C. O'Brien , a law partner of Mr. Smith , the trustee , and Olcott D. Smith , retired chairman of Aetna Life and Casualty Co . At least it was n't included in the $425,000 total of possibly improper payments . the committee has twice announced . Neither Mr. Marshall , nor members of the audit committee nor representatives of Arthur Andersen &; Co. or Paul , Weiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did much of the staff work in preparing the audit , will comment on the background of the $470,958 payment or describe it When this newspaper , on its own , attempted to track the payment to Arbourage down , its efforts led to a file drawer in the office of L. Michael Gould , an attorney on Jersey who says he often does work for Avis and knows Mr Marshall " I remember the company well , " says Mr Gould , adding that he probably formed Arbourage in 1974 for a foreign national ( non-British residenti but not for Avis " It probably does n't exist any more , " he said " I forget I form hundreds of these things a year and they rapidly fall by the wayside - Markings on the back of the Avis check indicate it was endorsed over by Arbourage to an accounting and tax shelter services firm on Jersey run by Michael Forrest " I vaguely remember something about that transaction , " said Mr Forrest " We 're often asked to handle these things for our clients . " He stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish it had . " he said with a laugh A Tantalizing Omission A check of his records , Mr Forrest said , would be done only with the approval of his client . Mr Gould Mr Forrest added , " It probably would n't be of much use The money would have gone to Switzerland or something like that " Whether the nearly half-million-dollar payment was indeed sent on to a banker in Switzerland who laundered it in some way before it reached Italian government officials or whether it was a completely legitimate operation is a matter the audit committee apparently found no'need to clarify This omission is particularly tantalizing because there reportedly is nothing in Avis 's records to indicate a prior letter of agreement for the payment For his part , Mr. Gould , who helped set up Arbourage , said no one had made any inquiries about it , and he added he had never even heard of the audit committee study that was turned over to the SEC Meanwhile , at Avis , much more attention seems to be directed at illicit payments that possibly can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's so much executive suite backstabbing that 's gone on , I 'm just heartsick , " says Thomas Morrow , Mr. Morrow 's brother , himself a former Avis vice president and a subject of the audit committee 's investigation Squabbling Executives It 's no secret that feelings have run high within the company for the last two years Winston Morrow and R J Smith , the trustee , openly despised each other Even before the audit committee 's investigation got under way last summer , several executives are understood to have begun taping their phone conversations in an apparent effort to " get the goods " on adversaries within the compahy One phone conversation is believed to have been taped at both ends When the audit committee finally arrived at its estimate of $425,000 of suspect payments , the total was small potatoes compared with what some companies were admitting to  --  Lockheed 's $22 million package of payoffs , for example . But in the car leasing and rental business a few thousand dollars can go a long way Besides the usual assortment of Latin American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed a variety of relatively penny-ante payoffs to officials in the U S in a position to do favors for the company Free Rides Beyond that , it 's known that investigators , following up a scandal that first surfaced in 1973 , uncovered certain New York City officials , including a high municipal parking executive , allegedly driving around in free Avis cars This is considered possibly significant because at one time the city had claims of more than $1 4 million against Avis , representing unpaid fines accumulated by Avis 's rental customers . The matter never went to court , however , and apparently has been settled . The New York investigations , it 's understood , were at the heart of the conflict between Mr Morrow and the trustee last October which led to Mr Morrow 's resignation . The audit committee disclosure last week outlined $6,700 in cash payments to an unidentified municipal official from 1971 through 1973 to reimburse him for the cost of a vehicle rented by him . It said one portion apparently came from off-book cash under the control of former officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated from employe expense vouchers . It 's known the Avis board has turned over the audit committee 's finding to the U.S. Attorney 's office for the Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn and Long Island 1 . It is believed the audit committee study indicated there might be a link between these payments and Thomas Morrow and that the trustee and certain board members felt so strongly that this existed with Winston Morrow 's apparent knowledge that they asked him to resign even before the report was completed . Winston Morrow made his resignation official just three days before Christmas . 1976 . When asked in a recent niter iew if the allegations had led to a " moral confrontation . " he replied . " Moralistic would be more like it ? ' He added " There were a number of reasons why I decided to resign , " but he conceded that if given a free hand , he would n't have selected that particular time Payments alleged in the report to be tied directly to Mr Morrow include an $800 domestic payment , currently under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cash slush fund run by Avis employes in Europe and since discontinued Mr Morrow had no comment on these charges Mr Morrow 's relations with his brother , Thomas , were a critical factor in his disagreement with the Avis board Somewhat of a jokester , Thomas Morrow was known around Avis headquarters as " TC " for " Top Cat " and had risen to be a vice president when the scandal first broke about the free use of Avig cars by New York City officials . He then left the company . " About that , I 'll only say I was very disturbed , and I quit in a violent fashion because of what I thought was not right , " he says Nevertheless , in January , 1975 , he was quietly rehired by Avis in the newly created position of " Director of Parking Operations U S A. " That drew a few snickers around Avis headquarters , possibly because Avis has only one commercial parking lot , in Chicago , and because Mr. Morrow was rarely seen around his office at Garden City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his home in Valdosta , Ga , on a new concept for servicing parked cars at airports during the last two years he worked for Avis He finally resigned again or was fired last December 31 One reason for Thomas Morrow 's difficulties with the home office was his long-standing relationship with Bernard Berdstein , Avis 's Southeastern regional vice president , whom he had hired in 1964 and who was fired in May . 1975 . Three months ago Mr. Bernstein was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami along with Sidney Myres , Avis 's former regional manager in Miami They were charged with defrauding certain of Avis 's car-lease customers over a period of six years to the apparent benefit of Avis . Several former Avis employes in Miami , in turn , have sued Avis , charging they were discharged because of what they had told the company 's lawyers , who asked for sworn examinations after their grand jury testimony , or because of what they refused to tell Avis investigators .

Instead , the Miami office allegedly was tacking these profits onto cars sold from closed-end leases , where the customers were n't supposed to get the profits , in its reports to Avis 's Garden City headquarters Checks were deposited in Miami in a one-way bank account and received at headquarters , where it apparently took six years to discover the discrepancy . How had the practice originated ? Mr. Myres testified : " Well , we would have to go back to the ' 605 , as I recall , where some customers received some rather large rebates on the open-end lease program , and to avoid this occurrence in the future , we were advised to handle it in this fashion " He added that he thought this was " general knowledge in the organization .

" Beyond that , Mr. Bernstein is known to have told friends that he had purposely tried to get Avis executives to " chat " about other wrongdoing in the company on the tapes . In the Miami operation , one of Avis 's top profit makers under Mr. Bernstein , the company has installed a new management and staff at its car-leasing office .
