Watergate and its climax last week may have been America 's most traumatic political experience of this century . Such a shock to the political system can affect the nation for years-perhaps adversely , perhaps beneficially . To measure the probable impact of those events , TIME asked leading scholars and observers of the national scene to analyze the legacy of Watergate . Historian Henry Steele Commager 's essay on the lessons of crisis appears at the end of this issue . Other assessments follow . <P> <P> " Hour and Man May Have Met " <P> HENRY GRAFF <P> Professor of history at Columbia University <P> The most significant events in history are not always immediately recognized for what they are . In school , we learned that the linchpin of the 1920s was the Sacco-Vanzetti case . Today we realize that Robert Goddard 's experiments in rocket propulsion during that period were much more important for the distant future . When you look at the Nixon resignation from the perspective of drama , there are few parallels . But as to its cataclysmic properties-well , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing of the air . We will have a honeymoon period with the new President . Even the press will lay off , and that will be good for America . It will be good for our critical faculties ; we must rest them . We need to rest our nay-saying instincts and the belief that we can all put ourselves in the positions of the high and mighty and tell them how to run things . <P> We will quickly discover that Gerald Ford 's limitations , which seem pretty clear , are not going to seem so horrendous . To be sure , it is a handicap that Ford was not elected to the presidency . He is unprepared for the office with respect to administrative experience ; that certainly is a handicap . But he will triumph because he has not lusted after the office of President . Ford is an honest man . He gets on well with the people . He is an open man , and what our society needs now is openness . Artfulness got Lyndon Johnson in trouble abroad ; artfulness got Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise us . The need of the hour and the man may have met . <P> Having a less regal type in the White House , the American public will perhaps become less dependent on the ukase of the President , not through cynicism but through the recognition of the reality that was always there . This would be a glorious thing . The new Administration 's promised partnership with Congress , sorely needed and long overdue , could be an exalting experience for all Americans . <P> As a starting approach to one of the major problems he faces , Ford could call a world economic conference to deal with the interlocked issues of raw materials , food supplies , the banking structure and currency . It would demonstrate to the world that there is a man in charge in America . <P> <P> " A Yearning for Simple Symbols " <P> GEORGE E.
