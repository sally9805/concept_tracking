next breath approved and made law those very acts of Caesar for the proposal of which he had been killed . However terrible the deed , the conspirators had acted with bravery and force ; and then they scattered like frightened women after they had taken their first step . Antonius , as Caesar 's friend , roused the people against the assassins ; yet the night before the Ides of March he had entertained the murderers at dinner , was seen speaking intimatelywith one of them ( Trebonius ) at the instant of the murder , and dined again with those same men two nights later ! He aroused the populace again to burn and loot in protest against the murder ; and then approved their arrest and execution for that lawlessness . He made Caesar 's will to be read publicly ; and then opposed its enactment with all his power . Above all , we knew that we could not trust Antonius , and we knew him to be a formidable foe  --  not because of his shrewdnessand skill , but because of his thoughtlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some of the young now hold him , he was not a very intelligent man ; he had no real purpose beyond the moment of his will ; and he was not exceptionally brave . He did not even perform his own suicide well , and he did it long after his situation was hopeless , so that it was too late for it to be done with dignity . How do you oppose a foe who is wholly irrational and unpredictable  --  and yet who , out of animal energy and the accident of circumstance , has attained a most frightening power ? ( Looking back on it , it is odd to remember that at once we construedAntonius to be our foe rather than the Senate , though our most obvious enemies were there ; I suppose instinctively we felt that if such a bungler as Antonius could manage them , we should not have that much trouble with him either , when the time came . ) I do not know how you oppose him ; I only know what we did . Let me tell you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed by him . He was the most powerful personage in Rome ; we had nothing except a name . We determined that our first necessity was to get recognition from him . We had not been able to get that by overtures of friendship ; thus we had to try the overtures of enmity.  |p41First  , we talked  --  among Antonius 's enemies and among his friends . Or , rather , we questioned , innocently , as if we were trying to understand the events of the day . When did they supposeAntonius would give attention to Caesar 's will ? Where were the tyrannicides  --  Brutus , Cassius , the others ? Had Antonius gone over to the Republicans , or was he still faithful to Caesar 's Party of the People ? That sort of thing . And we were careful to insure that reports of these conversations got back to Antonius . At first there was no response from him . We persisted . And then at last we heard descriptions of his annoyance ; retellings of insults he gave to Octavius began making the rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip . And then we made the move that had to bring him into the open . Octavius had , with some small assistance from me , composed a speech ( I may have a copy of it somewhere among my papers ; if my secretary can discover it , I will send it on to you ) , in which he sorrowfully announced to the people that despite the will , Antoniuswould not release Caesar 's fortune to him , but that he ( Octavius ) , having taken Caesar 's name , would fulfill Caesar 's obligations  --  that the bequest would be paid them out of his own pocket . The speech was made . There was nothing really inflammatoryin it ; the tone was one of sorrow , regret , and innocentbewilderment . But Antonius acted precipitately , as we had hoped he would . He at once introduced legislation into the Senate which would prevent the legal adoption of Octavius ; he allied himself with Dolabella , who at that time was co-consul with him and who had been close to the conspirators ; he enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assassination had fled Rome and gone to his legion in Gaul ; and he made open threats against Octavius 's life . Now you must understand that the position of many of the soldiers and citizens was extremely difficult  --  or at least so it seemed to them . The rich and powerful were almost without exceptionagainst Julius Caesar , and thus against Octavius ; the soldiersand the middle citizenry almost without exception loved JuliusCaesar , and hence favored Octavius ; yet they knew that Marcus Antonius had been Caesar 's friend . And now they werep42witnessing what they took to be a destructive battle between the only two persons who might take their part against the rich and aristocratic . Thus it happened that Agrippa , who better than any of us knew the soldiers ' life and language and habits of thought , went among those minor officers and centurions and common soldiers whom we knew to be veterans of the campaigns and friends to Caesar , and supplicated them to use their offices and common loyalty to quiet the dispute that had grown needlessly between Marcus Antonius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assured of Octavius 's love and convinced that Antonius could not look upon their efforts as rebellion or disloyalty , they acted . They were persuaded ( there were several hundred of them , I believe ) to march first to Octavius 's house on the hill . It was important that they go there first , you will understand . Octavius pretended surprise , listened to their pleas for friendship with Antonius , and made a brief speech to them in which he forgave Antoniusthe insults and agreed to repair the breach that had grown between them . You may be certain that we made sure Antonius was informed of this deputation ; if they had marched upon his house without warning , he might easily have mistaken their intentionand thought they were led against him in retaliation for his threats upon Octavius 's life . But he knew of their coming ; and I have often tried to imagine his anger as he awaited them alone in that huge mansion where Pompeius once lived and that Antonius had appropriated after Caesar 's murder . For Antonius knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had an intimation then of the course his life was to run . At Agrippa 's prompting , the veterans insisted that Octavius come with them  --  which he did , though he would not walk in a position of honor , but was escorted at the rear of the line of march . I must say that Antonius behaved reasonably well when we marched into his courtyard . One of the veterans hailed him , he came out and saluted them , and listened to the speech that had already been given to Octavius  --  though he was a little curt and sullen when he agreed to the conciliation . Then Octavius was brought forward ; he greeted Antonius , the salutation was returned , and the veterans cheered . We did not linger ; but I wasp43standing very near the two of them when they came together , and I shall always believe that there was a small , grudging , but appreciative smile on Antonius 's face when they clasped hands . That , then , was the first small power we had . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Livy . I shall write again soon , when my health permits it . For there is more that may be said . Postscript : I trust that you will be discreet in the use of what I tell you . X. Letter : Marcus Tullius Cicero to Marcus Junius Brutus ( September , 44 B.C. ) The events of the past few months have put me in despair . Octaviusquarrels with Antonius ; I have hope . Their differences are reconciled , they are seen together ; I am fearful . They quarrel again , rumors of plots are in the air ; I am puzzled . Once again they mend their disputes ; and I am without joy . What does it all mean ? Does either of them know where he is going ? Meanwhile , their disputes and reconciliations keep all of Rome in a turmoil , and keep the assassination of the tyrant alive in the minds of everyone ; and through it all , Octavius 's strength and popularity steadily increase . I sometimes almost believe that we may have misjudged the boy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event which makes him appear more capable than he is . I do not know . It is too dark . I have found it necessary to speak against Antonius in the Senate , though it may have put me in some danger . Octavius gives me his support in private conversation , but he does not speak in public . In any event , Antonius now knows that I am his implacableenemy . He threatened such harm that I dared not give my second address to the Senate ; but it will be published , and the world will know it . XI .

Consular Order to Gaius Sentius Tavus , Military Commander of Macedonia at Apollonia , with Letter ( August , 44 B.C. ) By authority of Marcus Antonius , Consul to the Senate of Rome , Governor of Macedonia , Pontifex of the Lupercalian College , and Commander in Chief of the Macedonian Legions , Gaius Sentius Tavus is hereby ordered to command the chief officers of the Macedonian Legions to mobilize their forces in preparation for a crossing to Brindisi , to make this crossing at the earliest moment in his power , and to hold the legions in that place against the arrival of their supreme commander . Sentius : this is important . He spent part of last year at Apollonia . He may have made friends with some of the officers . Investigatethis most carefully .

A Libel : Distributed to the Macedonian Legions , at Brindisi ( 44 B.C. ) To the followers of the murdered Caesar : Do you march against Decimus Brutus Albinus in Gaul , or against the son of Caesar in Rome ? Ask Marcus Antonius . Are you mobilized to destroy the enemies of your dead leader , or to protect his assassins ? Ask Marcus Antonius.  |p45Where  is the will of the dead Caesar which bequeathed to every citizen of Rome three hundred pieces of silver coin ? Ask Marcus Antonius . The murderers and conspirators against Caesar are free by an act of the Senate sanctioned by Marcus Antonius . The murderer Gaius Cassius Longinus has been given the governorship of Syria by Marcus Antonius . The murderer Marcus Junius Brutus has been given the governorship of Crete by Marcus Antonius . Where are the friends of the murdered Caesar among his en-emies ? The son of Caesar calls to you . XIV .

The Acts of Caesar Augustus ( A.D. 14 ) At the age of nineteen , on my own initiative and at my own expense , I raised an army by means of which I restored liberty to the Republic , which had been oppressed by the tyranny of a faction.  | . Letter : Gaius Cilnius Maecenasto Titus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters that you require of me  --  I could not have suspected how they would take me hack to the days that are gone , and through what a strange tangle of emotionsI must go on that journey ! Now in these uneventful years of my retirement , as my time on earth draws to an end , the days seem to hasten with unseemly speed ; and only the past is real , so that I go there as if I were reborn , as Pythagoras says we are , into another time and another body . So many things whirl around in my head  --  the disorder of those days ! Can I make sense of them , even to you , who know more of the history of our world than any mortal ? I comfort myself with the certainty that you will make sense of what I tell you , even if I can not . Marcus Antonius went to Brindisi to meet the Macedonian legionsthat he had called up , and we knew that we must act . We had no money : Octavius had stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius 's bequests to the people . We had no authority : according to the law , not for ten years would Octavius be eligible to become even a member of the Senate , and of course Antonius had blocked every special privilege that thep47Senate would have given him . We had no power : only a few hundred of the veterans of Caesar 's army in Rome had unequivocallydeclared for us . We had a name , and the force of our determination . So Octavius and Agrippa went immediately to the south , to the Campanian coastal farms where Caesar had settled many of his veterans . We knew what Antonius was offering recruits as an enlistment bounty ; we offered five times that amount . We offered money that we did not have ; it was a desperate gamble , but it was a necessary one . I remained in Rome and composed letters for distribution among the Macedonian legions that were nominallyunder Antonius 's command . We had had promises from t hem earlier , and had reason to believe that some would defect to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters had their effect  --  though it was not precisely what we had anticipared . For Antonius then made the first of his many serious blunders . Because of some wavering on the part of two of the legions  --  the Macedonian IV and the Martian , I believe  --  he had some three hundred officers and men put to death . More than the letters , I am sure , this action worked to our advantage . During the starch to Rome , these two legions simply diverged to Alba Longa , and sent word to Octavius that they would cast their fortuneswith his . It was not the cruelty of Antonius 's act that outragedthem , I think ; soldiers are used to cruelty and death . But they could not trust themselves to a man who would act so rashly and unnecessarily . In the meantime , Octavius and Agrippa had had a small success in raising the beginnings of an army to meet the Antonian threat . Some three thousand men with arms ( though we let it be thought that it was double that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number without arms pledged themselves to our future . With a sizable portion of this three thousand , Octaviusmarched toward Rome , leaving Agrippa in command of the rest and charging him to march with them toward Arezzo ( the place of my birth , as you will remember ) , and to raise whatever other troops he could on the way . It was a pitiful force to range against the power of our enemies ; but it was more than we had had in the beginning.  |p48Octavius  encamped the army a few miles outside of Rome and entered the city with only a small body of men to guard his person , and offered his services to the Senate and the people against Antonius ; it was known that Antonius was marching toward Rome , and no one could be sure of his purpose . But in their divisionand impotence , the Senate refused ; and in their confusion and fear , the people did not speak as one . As a result , most of the army that we had raised at so much cost to ourselves dispersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at Rome , and a few hundred more who marched ( futilely , we thought ) with Agrippa toward Arezzo . Octavius had sworn to himself , to his friends , and to the people that he would have vengeance upon the murderers of his father . And now Antonius was marching through Rome on his way to Gaul  --  to punish ( he said ) Decimus Albinus , one of the conspirators . But we knew ( and Rome feared ) his real purpose , which was to gain for himself the Gallic legions under Decimus 's command . With those legions , he would be invincible ; and the world would lie like an unguarded treasure house before his plundering ambition . We simply faced the death of the Rome for which Caesar had given his life . Do you see the position we were in ? We had to prevent the punishment of one of those very criminals we had ourselves sworn to punish . And it became clear to us that , unexpectedly , another end had discovered us  --  an end larger than revenge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task enlarged themselves before us , and we felt that we peered into a bottomless chasm . Without money , without the support of the people , without the authority of the Senate  --  we could only wait for what would ensue . Octavius withdrew the remnants of his army from the outskirts of Rome , and began slowly to follow Agrippa 's little band to Arezzo though it seemed now that there was no hope of diverting or even delaying Antonius 's progress to Gaul . And then Antonius made his second serious blunder . In his vanity and recklessness , he marched into the city of Rome with his legions ; and they were fully armed . Not for forty years  --  since the butcheries of Marius and Sulla  --  had Roman citizens seen armed soldiers inside the cityp49walls ; and there were people still alive then who could remember the cobbles dark with blood , and there were senators then in the I louse who as young men had seen the rostrum piled with the heads of the senators of that day , and could remember the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Antonius swaggered and drank and whored through the city , and his soldiers plundered the houses of his enemies ; and the Senate cowered , and did not dare oppose him . Then the news came to Antonius from Alba that the Martian legion had deserted him and had declared for us . It is said that he was drunk at the time he got the news ; in any event , he acted as if ' he were . For he precipitately called the Senate to meet ( he was still consul , remember ) , and in a long irrational harangue demandedthat Octavius be branded a public enemy . But before the speech was over , another piece of news came into the city , and was whispered among the senators even as Antonius was speaking . The Macedonian IV legion , following the Martian , had declaredits allegiance to Octavius and the party of the Caesars . In his rage , Antonius lost control of what little good sense he had . He had defied the constitution once by entering the city with his armed forces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and by threatening his opponents with harm if they attended the meeting . In this illegal assemblage , he accomplished the following : he had Macedonia given to his brother , Gaius ; and the provinces of Africa , Crete , Libya , and Asia to his own supporters . And then he hastened to the rest of his army at Tivoli , whence he began his march to Rimini , where he was to prepare his siege of Decimus in Gaul . Thus , what Octavius could not accomplish by his caution , Antoniusaccomplished for us by his recklessness . Where there had been despair , I could see hope . Now , my old friend , I will tell you something that no one knows ; and you may use it in your history , if you wish . It is known that during the midst of these events , Octavius was on his slow march with the raggle of his troops to Arezzo ; what is not known is that , at the moment of Antonius 's open display of contempttoward the Senate and the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate and the people to be what they were , I sent an urgent message to Octavius to return , in dead se- cret , to Rome , so that we could make our plans . As Antonius swaggered boisterously out of the city , Octavius came secretly in . And we laid the plan that would give us the world . II . Letter : Marcus Tullius Ciceroto Marcus Junius Brutus , at Dyrrachium ( January , 43 B.C. ) My dear Brutus , the news we have in Rome from Athens fills all of us who honor the Republic with joy and hope . Had the others who are our heroes acted so boldly and with such decision as you have , our nation would not now be in such a state of turmoil . To think that , so shortly after the illegal assignment that Marcus Antonius made of Macedonia to his half-witted brother Gaius , now that same Gaius cowers in fear in Apollonia , while your armies grow and gather the strength that will one day be our salvation ! Would that your cousin Decimus had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our banquet of the Ides of March ! I am sure that the disturbing news of Antonius 's new madness has reached you even in Dyrrachium . Disregarding all law and custom , he has terrorized the city ; and now he marches into Gaul against Decimus . And until a few weeks ago , it was clear to all of us that he would be successful in that endeavor . But young Caesar ( I call him that now , despite my aversion to the name ) and his young friend , Maecenas , came to me in secret with a plan . The boy has asked my advice before , and has courted me ; but only recently have I become persuaded that he may be of serious consequence and help to us . Despite his incredible youth , and his much too diffident manner , he has accomplished remarkable things during these last few months . Quite correctly , he pointed out to me that he maintains the only force capable of deterring Antonius : one army , under MarcusAgrippa , now marches to Arezzo , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaul ; and another , which has been discreetly encamped several miles from Rome , follows that ; and the gods know how many other veterans and recruits they will pick up on the way . But ( and this is what makes me begin to trust the young leader ) he will not move illegally ; he must havep51the sanction of the Senate and the people . And he proposes that I use my offices ( which are still not inconsiderable , I imagine ) to effect this sanction . This I have consented to do , under conditions that are mutuallyagreeable . For his part , young Octavius Caesar asked that the Senate sanction his actions in raising the army ; that the veteranswho had joined him , as well as the IV Macedonian and the Martian legions , be formally given honor and the thanks of the people ; that he himself be legally given command of the forces that he had raised and that no man be put in military authority over him ; that the state defray the expenses of his army and supplythem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands be allotted to the troops after their service ; and that the Senate waive the law of age ( as it has done before ) and upon his successful alleviation of the siege of Decimus at Mutina , that he return to Rome as a senator and be allowed to stand for consul . In another time and in other circumstances , these might have seemed excessive demands ; but if Decimus falls , then we are ruined . I confess to you , my dear Brutus , I would have promised nearly anything ; but I put a grave face on , and made some demandsof my own . I stipulated that in no way would he or his men take that revengeupon Decimus which he had earlier threatened ; that he not oppose as a senator the decrees that I might pass in behalf of the legality of Decimus 's position in Gaul ; and that he not use the armiessanctioned by the Senate for an adventure against either you in Macedonia or our friend Cassius in Syria . To all these conditions he agreed , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the bargain , he would take no action on his own authority nor allow those under his command to do so . Thus our cause advances . I have given the speech which put these proposals before the Senate ; but as you know , the real work came before I dared to speak , and still I can not rest in my labors.  | III . Quintus Salvidienus Rufus : Notes for a Journal , at Rome ( December , 44 B.C. ) Restless , I await my fate . Gaius Octavius is secretly in Rome ; Agrippa marches to the north ; Maecenas intrigues with everyone , our friends and enemies alike . Yesterday he returned from an afternoonspent with Fulvia herself , that red-faced harridan who is the wife of that same Antonius against whom we are to march . The Senate has given Octavius Caesar powers that a month ago we could not have dreamed : the legions of the next consuls , Hirtiusand Pansa , are ours ; Octavius has military powers second to none , he will be allowed into the senatorial ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been given the command of a legion , by Octavius himself with the sanction of the Senate . It is an honor that I could not reasonably have expected for many years . Yet I am restless , and filled with a foreboding . For the first time I become unsure of the rightness of our course . Every successuncovers difficulties that we have not foreseen , and every victory enlarges the magnitude of our possible defeat . Octavius has changed ; he is no longer the friend we had in Apollonia . He seldom laughs , he takes almost no wine , and he seems to disdain even the harmless , distracting pleasures that we took with the girls once . So far as I know , he has not even had a woman since our return to Rome . " So far as I know , " I realize I have said . Once we knew all about each other ; now he has become contained , withdrawn , almostsecretive . I , to whom he once talked with open friendship ; from whom he had no secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I no longer know him . Is it grief for his uncle that will not leave him ? Is it that grief which has hardened into ambition ? Or is it something else that I can not name ? A cold sadness has come over him and draws him apart from us . In my leisure now in Rome , as I wait for the consular armies to be raised , I can think of these things , and wonder . Perhaps when I am older and wiser I shall understand them . Gaius Octavius on Cicero : " Cicero is a hopeless conspirator . What he does not write to his friends , he tells to his slaves . "  |p53When  did the distrust begin ?  --  if it is distrust . The morning that Octavius and Maecenas announced the plan to me ? I said : " We would aid that Decimus who was one of the murderersof Julius Caesar ? " Octavius said : " We would aid ourselves , so that we might sur-vive . " I did not speak . Maecenas had not spoken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made  --  you and I and Agrippa and Maecenas  --  that night in Apollonia ? " I said : " 1 have not forgotten . " Octavius smiled . " Nor have I. . . . We shall save Decimus , though we hate him . We shall save Decimus for that oath , and we shall save him for the law . " For an instant his eyes were cold upon me , though I think he did not see me . Then he smiled again , as if remembering himself . Did it begin with that ? Facts : Decimus was one of the murderers ; Octavius goes to his aid . Casca was one of the murderers ; Octavius has agreed not to oppose his election as tribune of the people . Marcus Antonius was a friend of Caesar ; Octavius now opposes him . Cicero rejoicespublicly in the murder ; Octavius has made an alliance with him . Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius raise armies in the East , plunderthe treasuries of the provinces , and daily augment their strength ; Marcus Aemilius Lepidus is secure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose no one knows ; and in the south , Sextus Pompeius roams the seas at will , raising barbarianarmies that may destroy us all . The legion that I command  --  all the legions in Italy  --  is the task too large ? But Gaius Octavius is my friend.  | IV . Letter : Marcus Tullius Ciceroto Marcus Aemilius Lepidusat Narbonne , from Rome ( 43 B.C. ) My dear Lepidus , Cicero sends you greetings , and begs you to remember your duty to the Senate and the Republic . I would not mention now the many honors I have been privileged to do you , were I not filled with gratitude for the many kindnesses you have done me . As we have assured each other in the past , our differenceshave always been honorable ones , and have rested upon our mutual love for the Republic . Though I put little faith in such , the rumors in Rome are that you will join forces with Marcus Antonius against Decimus . I do not seriously entertain such a possibility , and I see the rumor only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our poor Republic . But I think you should know that the rumor does persist , so that for your own safety and honor you might take the most urgent measures to prove it baseless . The young Caesar , with the blessing of the Senate and the Republic , marches toward Mutina against the outlaw , Antonius , who besieges Decimus . It may be that he will need your aid . I know that you will now , as you have in the past , observe the order of the law and refuse the chaos of lawlessness , for the sake of your position and the security of Rome . V. Letter : Marcus Antoniusto Marcus Aemilius Lepidusat Narbonne , from Mutina ( 43 B.C. ) Lepidus : I am at Mutina against the hired armies of the murderersof Caesar . Decimus is surrounded ; he can not break out . I am informed that Cicero and others of his odor have been writing you , urging treason against the memory of our slain Julius . The reports of your intentions are ambiguous . I am not a subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a fool . There are three courses open to you : you can march from your camp to join me in the destruction of Decimus and the en/emies of Caesar , and thereby gain my eternal friendship and the power that will come to you from the love of the people ; you can remain unconcerned and neutral in the comfort of your encampment , and thereby receive neither my blame nor the hatred of the people  --  nor their love ; you can come to the aid of the traitor Decimus and his " savior , " the false son of our leader , and thereby receive my enmity and the lasting despite of the people . I hope that you have the wisdom to choose the first course ; I fear that you will have the caution to choose the second ; I imploreyou , for your own safety , not to choose the third . VI . The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) We found the Rome we entered torn by strife and ambition . Marcus Antonius , the pretended friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would not allow him whom we now called Octavius Caesar to receive the honors and powers bequeathed him by his father . Upon ascertaining the ambition of the usurper Antonius , Octavius Caesar took himself into the countryside where his father 's veterans tilled the soil , and we raised those troops loyal to the memory of their dead leader who would oppose with us the plunderers of our nation 's dream . Unlawfully , Marcus Antonius levied the Macedonian troops and marched with them into Rome , and thence to Mutina , where he laid siege to Decimus Brutus Albinus . And though Decimus had been among the murderers of Caesar , for the sake of order and the state , Octavius Caesar agreed to defend his lawful governorship of Gaul against the force of the outlaw Antonius ; and with the thanks and sanction of the Senate , we gathered our forces and marched toward Mutina , where Antonius had encampedaround the legions of Decimus . Now I must tell of that campaign at Mutina , which was the first responsibility of war I had under Octavius Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two consuls of the year , Gaius Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius , the latter of whom had been the trusted general of our late Julius Caesar . Octavius Caesar commanded the Martian and Macedonian IV legions , though of the latter I had military leadership . Quintus Salvidienus Rufus had been given the military command of the new legion of recruits we had levied in the countryside of Campania . Antonius had made his siege of Decimus complete , and he proposed to lie in wait until Decimus 's legions , weakened by hunger , must attempt to break through his encampment . We determined that Decimus had put away enough food within the walls of Mutinato endure , so we made winter quarters at Imola , only a twohourmarch from Mutina , so that we might quickly go to the aid of Decimus if he made a sally against the Antonian forces . But he cowered within the safety of the city walls , and would not fight ; so that when spring came , we faced the prospect of breaking through Antonius 's lines ourselves , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April we determined to move . Around Mutina the ground is marshy and uneven , cut by gulliesand streams ; beyond this marsh Antonius was encamped . In secret we searched the land for a way to cross , and discovered a ravine that was unguarded ; and in the dead of night , joined by Pansa and five cohorts of his legion , Octavius Caesar and Salvidienusand I led our Martian legion and other soldiers into this ravine , having wrapped our swords and spears with cloth so that the enemy would not be aware of our approach . The moon was full , but a heavy fog clung to the earth , so that we could not see before us ; and in single file , each man 's hand upon another 's shoulder , we inched blindly through the glowing mist , never sure of where we went or whom we might encounter . Through the night we crept , and in the morning came up on a high road in the marshes ; we waited for the fog to lift , and saw no enemy ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we heard a muffled voice , and we knew we were surrounded . The horn sounded the order for battle , and the soldiers came to their formation on the high ground . The young recruits were ordered by Pansa to stand aside , so as not to hinder the fighting of the veterans , but to stand in readiness if they were needed . For these were veterans of the Martian legion , and they remembered the slaughter of their comrades at Brindisi by the Antoniusthey now opposed . The space upon which we fought was so small that one sidep57could not flank another ; therefore , man fought man like gladiatorsin an arena , and the dust rose thick as the fog of the night before , and swords rang in the air , and no one shouted . We heard only the cries of the wounded and the deep groans of those who were dying . We fought through the morning and through the afternoon , one line relieving another as it became exhausted . Once Octavius Caesar himself came near death when he seized the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the consul , Pansa , in this engagement suffered a mortal wound . Antonius ordered fresh troops into the battle , and step by step we gave ground ; but under the command of Salvidienus the recruits fought as bravely is the veterans , and we were able to enter again into our camp whence we had come the night before . Antonius did not continue the attack after nightfall , so we went into the marsh that was littered with the bodies of our comrades , and carried back the wounded . That night we saw the campfires of Antonius 's army beyond the marsh , and heard the singing of his soldiers in their victory . We feared the slaughter that the next day might bring , for we were weary and our numbers were reduced by half ; and we knew that Antonius had troops that he had not used . But during that night , the legions of the consul Hirtius had been marching to our relief ; and joining us , made an attack upon Antonius 's camp , which was complacent and disordered in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many days , during which time the Antonian legions were reduced to half their number ; our losses were very slight . Salvidienus was given the legions of the dying Pansa , and he led them with bravery and skill . At last , our armies broke into the very camp of Antonius ; and the brave Hirtiuswas killed by one of Antonius 's guards , outside the tent where Antonius had lately rested and whence he had fled . Upon this defeat , Antonius lost heart ; and gathering what remained of his troops , marched northward toward the Alps , which he crossed at further cost to his strength , and joined the forces of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus , who had remained safely at Narbonne . After the flight of Antonius , Decimus , delivered from the siege , ventured outside the city walls . He sent messengers to Octavius Caesar , thanking him for his aid , and declaring that his own part in the murder of Julius Caesar had been caused by the deceptions of the other conspirators ; and he asked that Octavius Caesar conversewith him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convinced of the sincerity of his gratitude . But Octavius Caesar declined his thanks , saying : " I did not come to save Decimus ; therefore I will not accept his gratitude . I came to save the state ; and I will accept its thanks . Nor will I speak to the murderer of my father , nor look upon his face . He may go in safety by the authority of the Senate , not by my own . " Six months later , Decimus was surprised and killed by a chieftainof one of the Gallic tribes . He had the head of Decimus severed , and sent it to Marcus Antonius , who gave him a small reward .

That the siege of Decimus Brutus Albinus is lifted ; that the troops of Marcus Antonius are so reduced that they offer no immediatedanger to the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disorder ; that the consuls Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Vibius Pansa are dead , and that their legions are temporarilyunder the command of C.

That fifty days of thanksgiving be declared , in which the citizensof Rome will offer their gratitude to the gods and the senatorialarmies for the defeat of Marcus Antonius and the deliverance of Decimus Brutus Albinus . That the dead consuls Hirtius and Pansa be accorded public funerals , with full honors . That a public monument be erected to memorialize the gloriousdeed of the legions of Hirtius and Pansa . That Decimus Brutus Albinus be given a senatorial triumph for his heroic defeat of the outlaw Marcus Antonius.  |p59That  the following directive be sent to Gaius Octavius at Mu-tina ( copy appended ) : " The Praetors , Tribunes of the Plebeians , the Senate , the People and Commoners of Rome , send greetings to Gaius Octavius , tem -- porary commander of the Consular Legions : " You are given the thanks of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heroic defeat of the insurgentarmies of Marcus Antonius , and you are to know that , by edict of the Senate , Decimus Brutus has been made sole commanderof the legions in the furtherance of the pursuit of the Anfinnanforces . You are therefore ordered to turn over the consular legions of Hirtius and Pansa to Decimus Brutus without delay . You are further ordered to disband those legions that you raised on your own authority , giving them the thanks of the Senate , which has formed a commission to study the advisability of offeringthem some reward for their services . An envoy from the Sen -- ate has been sent to Mutina to deal with these matters ; you are to leave the transfer of powers to his offices . " All resolutions of Marcus Tullius Cicero passed by the Senate . VIII . Letter : Gaius Cilnius Maecenas toTitus Livius ( i3 B.C. ) We had heard the witticism that Cicero made : " We shall do die boy honor , we shall do him praise , and we shall do him in . " But I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so blatant and contemptuous a dismissal . Poor Cicero . . . . Despite the trouble he caused us and the harm that he intended , we were always rather fond of him . Such a foolish man , though ; he acted out of enthusiasm , vanity , and conviction . We had learned early that we could not afford those luxuries ; we proved , when we had to move , out of calculation , policy , and necessity . I was , of course , in Rome during the whole of this affair at Mutina ; as you know I have led armies in my time ( and not altogetherbadly , if I may say so ) , but I have always found the task rather boring  --  to say nothing of the discomfort . So if you need details about the actual fighting , you will have to go elsewhere . Ifp60our friend Marcus Agrippa would complete that autobiography with which he has been threatening us , you might find some helpful information there . But poor fellow , he has such problems now ( I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely he will . Octavius needed someone in Rome a good deal more than he needed an indifferent general  --  someone whom he could trust to keep him informed of the latest shifts in the senatorial whim , the latest intrigues , marriages , and so forth . And for this task I was admirably suited , I believe . At that time ( this was nearly thirty years ago , remember ) I fancied myself perfectly cynical , I thought ambition of any kind terribly vulgar , I was an inveterate gossip , and no one took me at all seriously . I posted him a daily newsletter , and he kept me informed of the situation in Gaul . So the action of Cicero and the Senate did not catch him unprepared . My dear Livy , I chide you often for your Republican and Pompeian sympathies ; and though I tease you out of affection , I am sure that you have understood that there is an edge of seriousnessin my scolding . You came to manhood in the northern tranquillityof Padua , which had for generations been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in Rome until after Actium and the reform of the Senate . Had the chance occurred , it is most likely that you would even have joined with Marcus Brutus to fight against us , as our friend Horace did in fact do , at Philippi , those many years ago . What you seem so unwilling to accept , even now , is this : that the ideals which supported the old Republic had no correspondenceto the fact of the old Republic ; that the glorious word concealed the deed of horror ; that the appearance of tradition and order cloaked the reality of corruption and chaos ; that the call to liberty and freedom closed the minds , even of those who called , to the facts of privation , suppression , and sanctioned murder . We had learned that we had to do what we did , and we would not be deterred by the forms that deceived the world . To put it briefly , Octavius defied the Senate . He did not disbandthe legions he had raised ; he did not relinquish the armies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the envoysp61from Rome access to Decimus . He waited into the summer , and the Senate trembled . Decimus hesitated to do anything at all ; and his own soldiers , revulsed by his weakness , deserted by the thousands to us . Cicero , fearful of our defiance , caused the Senate to order MarcusBrutus to return from Macedonia to Italy with his armies . We waited , and learned that Antonius had entered Gaul , and had joined the remnants of his forces with those of Lepidus . We had eight legions , with sufficient cavalry to support them , and several thousand lightly armed auxiliaries . Octavius left three of these legions and the auxiliaries under the command of Salvidienus , tt Mutina . He had messages sent to Atia and Octavia , his mother and sister , ordering them to take refuge in the Temple of the Vestal Virgins , where they would be safe from reprisals . And we marched on Rome. h was a necessary action , you must understand ; even had Octaviusbeen willing to relinquish the power we had won and to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the almost ccrt am expense of his life . For it was clear that the Senate was now embarked upon the inevitable , though delayed , consequence of the assassination : the Caesareans had to be exterminated . Antoniuswould be crushed by the consular armies that had been . augmented by those even larger ones of Brutus and Cassius , ' Inch were now ( by invitation of the Senate ) poised in the East , across the Adriatic Sea , waiting to invade Italy ; and Octaviuswould be destroyed in one way or another , by edict of the Senate , or more likely by private murder . Thus it was that suddenly Antonius 's cause became our own . The cause was survival ; survival depended upon alliance ; and alliance depended upon our strength . We marched on Rome with our legions armed as if for battle , and the news of our approach raced before us like the wind . Octaviusencamped his army outside the city upon the Esquiline hill , so that the people and the senators had but to raise their eyes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days , and not a drop of Roman blood was spilled . Our soldiers had the bounty promised them before the cam/paign at Mutina ; the adoption of Octavius by Julius Caesar was made into law ; Octavius was given the vacant consulship of Hirtius ; and we had eleven legions under our command . On the fourth day after the Ides of August ( though as you know the month then was called Sextilis ) , Octavius came into Rome to perform the ritual sacrifice attendant upon his accession to the consulship . A month later he celebrated his twentieth birthday . IX . Letter : Marcus Tullius Cicero toOctavius Caesar ( August , 43 B.C. ) You are quite right , my dear Caesar ; my labors for the state deservethe reward of tranquillity and rest . I shall therefore quit Rome and retire to my beloved Tusculum and devote my remainingyears to those studies which I have loved second only to my country . If I have misjudged you in the past , I have done so out of that love which too often imposes on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural inclinations . In any event , I doubly rejoice that you grant leave of absence to Philippus and myself ; for it means pardon for the past and indulgencefor the future . X. Letter : Marcus Antonius to Octavius Caesar , from the camp of Marcus Aemilius Lepidusnear Avignon ( September , 43 B.C. ) Octavius : My friend and lieutenant , Decius , whom you releasedat Mutina to return to me , tells me that you have treated those soldiers of mine that you captured with kindness and respect . For that , you have my gratitude . He further tells me that you made it apparent to him that you bear me no ill will , that you refused to surrender your troops to Decimus , and so forth . I see no reason why we should not talk , if you think it might be helpful . Certainly you have more in common with my cause than you have with the cause of those time-servers in the Senate . By the way , is it true ( as I fear ) that they have now also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months agop63they honored with a statue in the Forum ? Nothing surprises many more . You may have heard that Decimus is dead . A silly business : a little band of Gallic barbarians surprised him . I should have preferred to have dealt with him myself , at a later date . We could meet at Bononia next month ; I have some business there , mostly with the remnants of Decimus 's troops , who have decided to come in with me . I would suggest that we not meet with our forces behind us  --  just a few cohorts , perhaps , for our personal safety . If we came together in full force , our soldiers might get out of hand . Lepidus will have to figure in this , too ; so you can expect him . But our men can work out these details . XI .

All conspirators and murderers found guilty by Senatorial Jury and condemned to their fates.  | Xll . Letter : Gaius Cilnius Maecenas toTitus Livius ( /2 B.C. ) Of all the memories you have dredged from my soul by your questioning , my dear Livy , now you have found the saddest . I have for several days delayed writing you , knowing that I must confront again that old pain . We were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome with five legions of soldiers at our backs , it having been agreed that Antonius and Lepidus would bring no more troops than we did . The conference was to be held on that little island in the Lavinius , where the river widens toward the sea . Narrow bridges connected the island to both banks , and the country was perfectly flat , so that the armies could halt at some distance from the river , and yet keep each other in view at all times . Each side stationed a guard of perhaps a hundred men at either entrance of the bridge , and the three of us  --  myself , Agrippa , and Octavius  --  advanced slowly , while across from us Lepidus and Antonius , each with two attendants , came from the other bank at an equal pace . It was raining , I remember  --  a gray day . There was a small hut of unhewn stone a few yards away from the bridge , and we made our way toward that , meeting Antonius and Lepidus at the door . Before we entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , saying to him : " We shall not harm each other . We have come here to destroy the assassins ; we have not come to mimic them . " We stooped to enter the low door , and Octavius sat at the rough table in the center of the room , with Antonius and Lepiduson either side of him . You realize , of course , that a general agreement had been made even before we met : Octavius , Antothus , and Lepidus were to form a triumvirate modeled upon that of Julius Caesar , Gnaeus Pompeius , and Crassus , made nearly twenty years before ; this triumviral power was to last for five years . This power would give them the rule of Rome , with the right to appoint urban magistrates and command the provincial armies . The provinces of the West ( Cassius and Brutus held those of the East ) were to be divided among the triumvirs . We had alreadyaccepted what was by far the most modest portion thep65two Africas , and the islands of Sicily , Sardinia , and Corsica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt since Sextus Pompeius illegally held Sicily and controlled nearly the whole of the Mediterranean ; but land was not what we wanted from the compact . Lepidus retained what he had previously commanded : Narbonensis and the two Spains . And Antonius had the two Gauls , by far the richest and most important of the divisions . Behind it all , of course , was the necessity of our combining forces so that we might conquer Brutus and Cassius in the east and thus punish the murderers of Julius Caesar and bring order to Italy . It became quickly clear that Lepidus was Antonius 's creature . He was a pompous and fatuous man , though if he did not speak he made quite an imposing figure . You know the type  --  he looked like a senator . Antonius let him drone on for a few minutes , and then he made an impatient gesture . " We can get to the details later , " he said . " We have more importantbusiness now . " He looked at Octavius . " You know that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even though the whole Senate was bowing and scraping when you left , you can be sure they 're plotting against you now . " " I know , " Octavius said . He was waiting for Antonius to continue . " And not only in the Senate , " Antonius said . He got up and walked restlessly about the room . " All over Rome . I keep rememberingyour Uncle Julius . " He shook his head . " You ca n't trust anybody . " " No , " Octavius said . He smiled softly . " I keep thinking of them  --  soft , fat , rich , and getting richer . " He pounded his fist on the table , so that some of the papers there were jarred to the clay floor . " And our soldiers are hungry , and will get hungrier before the year 's out . Soldiers do n't fight on empty stomachs and without something to look forward to after it 's all over . " Octavius was watching him. - Antonius said : " I keep remembering Julius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with his enemies . " He shook his head again.  | There was a long silence . " How many ? " Octavius asked quietly . Antonius grinned and sat down at the table again . " I have thirty or forty names , " he said negligently . " I imagine Lepidus has a few of his own . " " You 've discussed this with Lepidus . " " Lepidus agrees , " Antonius said . Lepidus cleared his throat , stretched his arm out so that his hand rested on the table , and leaned back . " It is with much regretthat I have come to the conclusion that this is the only course open to us , unpleasant though it may be . I assure you , my dear boy , that  --  " " Do not call me your dear boy . " Octavius did not raise his voice ; like his face , it was totally without expression . " I am the son of Julius Caesar , and I am consul of Rome . You will not call me boy again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at Antonius . Antoniuslaughed . Lepidus fluttered his hands . " I assure you , I intendedno  --  no  --  " Octavius turned away from him and said to Antonius : " So it will be a proscription , as it was with Sulla . " Antonius shrugged . " Call it what you want to . But it 's necessary . You know it 's necessary . " " I know it , " Octavius said slowly . " But I do not like it . " " You 'll get used to it , " Antonius said cheerfully , " in time . " Octavius nodded absently . He drew his cloak more tightly about his body , and got up from the table and walked to the window . It was raining . I could see his face . The raindrops hit the window casement and splashed on his face . He did not move . It was as if his face were stone . He did not move for a long time . Then he turned to Antonius and said : " Give me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonius said slowly . " Even though you do n't like it , you will support it . " " I will support it , " Octavius said . " Give me your names . " Antonius snapped his fingers , and one of his attendants handed him a paper . He glanced at it , and then looked up at Octavius , grinning . " Cicero , " Antonius said.  |p67Octavius  nodded . He said slowly : " I know that he has caused us some trouble and that he has offended you . But he has given me his word that he will retire . " " Cicero 's word , " Antonius said , and spat on the floor . " He is an old man , " Octavius said . " He ca n't have many more years . " " One more year  --  six months  --  a month is too long . He has too much power , even in his defeat . " " He has done me harm , " Octavius said , as if to himself , " yet I am fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Antonius said . " Any other name  --  " he tapped the roll of paper "  --  I 'll discuss with you . But Cicero is not negotiable . " Octavius almost smiled , I think . " No , " he said , " Cicero is not negotiable . " He seemed to lose interest , then , in what they said . Antonius and Lepidus wrangled over names , and occasionally asked for his assent . He would nod absently . Once Antonius asked him if he did not want to add his own names to the list , and Octavius replied : " I am young . I have not yet lived so long as to acquire that many enemies . " And so , late that night , in the lamplight that flickered with every movement of the air , the list was drawn up . Seventeen of the richest and most powerful senators were to be at once condemned to death and their fortunes confiscated ; and a hundred and thirty more were to be proscribed immediately thereafter , and their names published , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Octavius said : " If it is to be done at all , it must be done withoutdelay . " And then we slept , like common soldiers , wrapped in our blankets , on the clay floor of the hut  --  it having been agreed that none of us would speak to our armies until all the details of the compact were settled . As you know , my dear Livy , much has been said and written of that proscription , both in blame and praise ; and it is true that the prosecution of the affair did get rather badly out of hand . Antonius and Lepidus kept adding names to the list , and a few of the soldiers used the confusion to settle their own enmities and to enrich themselves ; but such is to be expected . In the matter of passion , whether of love or war , excess is inevitable . ' Vet I have always been bewildered when , in the ease of peace , men raise the questions of praise or blame . It seems to me now that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thus judge do not judge so much out of a concern for right or wrong as out of a protest against the pitiless demands of necessity , or an approval of them . And necessity is simply what has happened ; it is the past . We slept the night , and rose before dawn  --  and now , my friend , I approach that sorrow of which I spoke at the beginning of this letter . It was dread of that approach , perhaps , which invitedme to this easy philosophizing , for which I trust you will forgive me . The proscriptions made , it now remained for the triumvirs to settle the affairs of Rome for the next five years . It had already been agreed that Octavius would relinquish the consulship that he had so recently received from the Senate ; by virtue of their position , each of the triumvirs already had consular powers , and it was felt that it was wiser to make use of lieutenants to perform those senatorial duties , thus enlarging the senatorial base of power and freeing the triumvirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's business was to choose the ten consuls who would have authority over the city for the next five years , and to divide the available legions among the triumvirs . We breakfasted on coarse bread and dates ; Antonius complained of the simplicity of the fare ; it was still raining . By noon the armies had been disposed , and in the transaction Octavius gained three legions that we had not had before , in addition to the eleven that we already commanded . The afternoon we were to devote to the choice of consuls . It was an important negotiation , you understand ; it was clear , though unspoken , that beyond the agreements we had made , there remained significant differences between the purposes of Marcus Antonius and Octavius Caesar . The consuls were the men who would represent the interests of the triumvirs , individually and collectively , in Rome ; it was essential that we choose those whom we could trust , and yet those who were acceptable to the other parties . It was a rather delicate matter , as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon that we had proceeded to the fourth year . And Octavius offered the name of Salvidienus Rufus . I am sure that you have had , as we all have , that mysterious experience of prescience  --  a moment when , beyond reason and cause , at a word , or at the flicker of an eyelid , or at anything at all , one has a sudden foreboding  --  of what , one does not know . I am not a religious man ; but I am sometimes nearly tempted to believe that the gods do speak to us , and that only in unguarded moments will we listen . " Salvidienus Rufus , " Octavius said ; and I had within me that sudden sickening rise , as if I were falling from a great height . For an instant Antonius did not move ; then he yawned , and said sleepily : " Salvidienus Rufus . . . . Are you sure he 's your choice ? " " He is my choice , " Octavius said . " You should have no objection to him . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were he not commanding the legions I left behind before I came here . " Octavius added dryly , " You will remember , 1believe , how well he fought against you at Mutina . " Antonius grinned . " I remember . Four years . . . . Do n't you think he might grow impatient in that time ? " " We will need him against Cassius and Brutus , " Octavius said patiently . " We will need him against Sextus Pompeius . If we survivethose battles , he shall have earned the office . " Antonius looked at him quizzically for a long moment ; then he nodded , as if he had decided something . " All right , " he said . " You can have him  --  either for the consulship or the proscription . Take your choice . " Octavius said : " I do not understand your joke . " " It 's no joke . " Antonius snapped his fingers ; one of his attendantshanded him a sheet of paper . Antonius dropped it negligentlyin front of Octavius . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , unrolled it , and read . His face did not change expression . He read for a long time . He handed the paper to me . ' Is this Salvidienus 's handwriting ? " he asked quietly . I read . I heard myself say , " It is Salvidienus 's handwriting . " He took the letter from my fingers . He sat for a long time looking in front of him . I watched his face and heard the dull hiss of the rain as it fell on the thatched roof . " It 's not a great gift , " Antonius said . " I have no use for him , now that we have our agreement . Now that you and I are together , I would n't be able to trust him . This kind of secret would do neither of us any good . " He pointed to the letter . " He sent it to me just after I had joined Lepidus at Avignon . I must say I was tempted , but I decided to wait until I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shall we put his name on the list ? " Antonius asked . Octavius shook his head . " No , " he said in a low voice . " You have to get used to these things , " Antonius said impatiently . " He 's a danger to us now , or will he . His name goes on the list . " " No , " Octavius said . He did not raise his voice , but the word filled the room . His eyes turned to Antonius , and they were like blue fire . " He is not to be proscribed . " Then he turned away from Antonius , and his eyes dulled . He said in a whisper : " The matter is not negotiable . " He was silent . Then he said to me : " You will write to Salvidienus and inform him that he is no longer a general of my armies , that he is no longer in my service , and  --  " he paused , "  --  that he is no longer my friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not have to . The words were in my mind , and they still are , after these more than twenty-five years , like an old scar . I give the words to you , as they were written : " Quintus Salvidienus Rufus sends greetings to Marcus Antonius . I command three legions of Roman soldiers , and am constrained to remain inactive as Decimus Brutus Albinus organizes his forces for a probable pursuit of your army and yourself . OctaviusCaesar has been betrayed by the Senate , and returns to Rome on a vain mission . I despair of his resolution , and I despair of our future . Only in you do I discern that purpose and will which may punish the murderers of Julius Caesar and rid Rome of the tyranny of an aristocracy . I will , therefore , put my legions at your disposal , if you will consent to honor me with a commandequal to your own , and if you will agree to pursue the cause to which I committed myself with Octavius Caesar andp71which has been betrayed by ambition and compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And so in my sorrow I sent the letter to him who had been our brother , using as messenger that Decimus Carfulenus who had jointly commanded at Mutina with Salvidienus . It was Carfulenus himself who told me of what ensued . Salvidienus had had rumors of Carfulenus 's mission , and waited for him alone in his tent . He was pale , Carfulenus said , but composed . He had been newly shaved , and in accordance with the necessity of the ritual his beard was deposited in the little silver box that lay open on his table . " I have put away my boyhood , " Salvidienus said , pointing to the box . " And now I may receive your message . " Carfulenus , so moved that he could not speak , gave him the letter . Salvidienus read it standing , nodded , and then sat down at his table , still facing Carfulenus . " Do you wish to reply ? " asked Carfulenus at last . " No , " Salvidienus said , and then he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation he removed a dagger from the folds of his toga , and with his strength and in Carfulenus 's sight , he plunged it into his breast . Carfulenus leaped toward him , but Salvidienus raised his left hand to stay his advance . And in a low voice , only a little breathless , he said : " Tell Octavius that if I can not remain his friend in life , I may do so in death . " He remained seated at his table until his eyes dulled , and he toppled to the dust . X111 .

The History of Rome . Titus Livius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the arrival of the triumvirs , had left the city , rightly convinced that he could no more escape Antoniusthan Cassius and Brutus could escape Octavius Caesar : at first he had fled to his Tusculan villa , then he set out by crosscountryroads to his villa at Formia , intending to take ship from Gaeta . He put out to sea several times , but was driven back by contrary winds : and since there was a heavy ground swell and he could no longer endure the tossing of the ship , he at last became weary of flight and of life , and returned to his villa on the high ground , which was little more than a mile from the sea . " Let me die , " he said , " in my own country , which I have often saved . " It is known that his slaves were ready to fight for him with bravery and loyalty : but he ordered them to set down the litter , and to suffer quietly the hard necessity of fate . As he leaned from the litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was struck off . But that did not satisfy the brutality of the soldiers : they cut off his hands , too , reviling them for having written against Antonius . So the head was brought to Antonius and by his order set between the two hands on the rostrum where he had been heard as consul and as consular , where in that very year his eloquent invectives against Antonius had commanded unprecedentedadmiration . Men were scarcely able to raise their tearful eyes and look upon the mangled remains of their countryman.  |p73I  . Letters : Strabo of Arnasia to Nicolaus of Damascus , from Rome ( 43 B.C. ) My dear Nicolaus , I send you greetings , as does our old friend and tutor , Tyrannion . I send you greetings from Rome , where I arrived only last week , after a long and most wearying journey  --  from Alexandria , by way of Corinth ; by sail and by oar ; by cart , wagon , and horseback ; and sometimes even on foot , staggeringbeneath the weight of my books . One looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of the world . It is a new sort of education , the gaining of which does not require a master . Indeed , if one travels enough , the pupil may become the master ; our Tyrannion , so learned in all things , has been at some pains to question me about what I have seen during my travels . I am staying with Tyrannion in one of a little group of cottageson a hill overlooking the city . It is a sort of colony , I suppose ; several established teachers ( one does not call them philosophersin Rome , where philosophy is somewhat suspect ) live here , and a few younger scholars who , like myself , have been invited to live and study with their former masters . I - was surprised when Tyrannion brought me here , so far away from the city ; and I was even more surprised when he explained the reason . It seems that the public library in Rome is worse than useless ; an incredibly small collection , often badly copied , and as many books in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrannion assures me that whatever texts I may need arc available , though in private collections . One of his friends , who lives here with us , is that Athenodorus of Tarsus of whom we heard so much at Alexandria ; he has , Tyrannion assures me , accessto the best private collections in the city , to which we wanderingscholars always are welcome . Of this Athenodorus I must say a few words . He is a most impressive man . He is only a few years older than Tyrannion  --  perhaps in his middle fifties  --  but he gives one the impression that he has the wisdom of all the ages somehow within his power . He is aloof and hard , but not unkind ; he speaks seldom , and never engages in those playful debates with which the rest of us amuse ourselves ; and we seem to follow him , though he does not lead . It is said that he has powerful friends , though he never drops a name ; and his personage is such that we hardly dare to discuss such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power in the world and of the mind , there is a sadness within him , the source of which I can not discover . I have resolved to talk to him , despite my trepidation , and to learn what I may . Indeed , you will be getting these letters through his auspices ; he has access to the diplomatic pouch that goes weekly to Damascus , and he has let me know that he will have these letters included . Thus , my dear Nicolaus , begins my adventure in the world . According to my promise , I shall write you regularly , sharing whatever new learning I get . I regret that you could not come with me , and I hope that the family affairs that keep you in Damascussoon are solved , and that you can join me in this strange new world . You must think me a bad friend and a worse philosopher ; I am not the former , but I may be on my way to becoming the latter . I had resolved to write you every week  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paper . But this is the most extraordinary of cities , and it threatens to engulf even the strongest of minds . Days tumble after each otherp75in a frenzy such as neither of us could have imagined during our quiet years of study together in the calm of Alexandria . I wonder if , in the balm and somnolence of your beloved Damascus , you can even conceive the quality that I ani trying to convey to you . With some frequency I am struck by the suspicion ( perhaps it is only a feeling ) that we are too complacent in our Greek pride tif history and language , and that we too easily assume a superiornvto the " barbarians " of the West who are pleased to call themselvesour masters . ( I am , you see , becoming somewhat less the philosopher and somewhat more the man of the world . ) Our provinces have their charm and culture , no doubt ; but there is a kind of vitality here in Rome that a year ago I could not have been persuaded was even remotely attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome ; now I have seen it ; and at this moment I am not sure that I will ever return to the East , or to my native Pontus . Imagine , if you will , a city which occupies perhaps half the area of that Alexandria where we studied as boys  --  and then think of that same city containing within its precincts more than twice the number of people that crowded Alexandria . That is the Rome that I live in now  --  a city of nearly a million people , I have been told . It is unlike anything I have ever seen . They come here from all over the world  --  black men from the burning sands of Africa , pale blonds from the frozen north , and every shade between . And such a polyglot of tongues ! Yet everyone speaks a little Latin or a little Greek , so that no one need feel a stranger . And how they crowd themselves together , these Romans . Beyondthe walls of the city lies some of the most beautiful countrysidethat you can imagine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net and struggle through narrow , winding little streets that run senselessly , mile after mile , through the city . During the daylight hours , these streets  --  all of them  --  are literallychoked with people ; and the noise and stench are incredible . A few months before his death , the great Julius Caesar decreedthat only in the dark hours between dusk and dawn might wagons and carts and beasts of burden be allowed in the city ; one wonders what it must have been like before that decree ,  | when horses and oxen and goods-wagons of all descriptions mingledwith the people on these impossible streets . Thus the ordinary Roman who lives in the city proper must never have any sleep . For the noise of the day becomes the din of the night , as drovers curse their horses and oxen , and the great wooden carts groan and clatter over the cobblestones . No one ventures out alone after dark , except those tradespeople who must and the very rich who can afford a bodyguard ; even on moonlit nights the streets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is impossible for even a vagrant ray of moonlight to find its way down into the streets . And the streets are filled with the desperate poor who would rob you and cut your throat for the clothes you wear and the little silver you might carry with you . Yet those who live in these towering ramshackle buildings are little safer than those who would wander the streets at night ; for they live in constant danger of fire . At night , in the safety of my hillside cottage , I can see in the distance the fires break out like flowers blooming in the darkness , and hear the distant shouts of fear or agony . There are fire brigades , to be sure ; but they are uniformly corrupt and too few to accomplish much good . And yet in the center of this chaos , this city , there is , as if it were another world , the great Forum . It is like the fora that we have seen in the provincial cities , but much grander  --  great columns of marble support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as many temples to their borrowed Roman gods ; and many more smaller buildings that house the various offices of government . There is a good deal of open space , and somehow the noise and stench and smoke from the surrounding city seem not to penetrate here at all . Here people walk in sunlight in open space , converse easily , exchange rumors , and read the news posted at the various rostra around the Senate House . I come here to the Forum nearly every day , and feel that I am at the center of the world . I begin to understand this Roman disdain for philosophy . Their world is an immediate one  --  of cause and consequence , of rumor and fact , of advantage and deprivation . Even I , who have devoted my life to the pursuit of knowledge and truth , can havep77some sympathy for the state of the world which has occasioned this disdain . They look at learning as if it were a means to an end ; at truth as if it were only a thing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the other way around . Here is a copy of a poem found this morning on every gate of importance that leads into the city . I shall not attempt a translation ; I transcribe it in its Latin : Stop , traveler , before you enter this farmhouse , and look to yourself . There is a boy lives here with the name of a man . You will dine with him at your peril . Oh , he 'll ask you , never fear ; he asks everyone . Last month his father died ; now the boy carouses on the stinking wine of his freedom and lets the livestock run wild beyond the broken fences  --  except for one , the farrow of a pet pig he has takeninto his household . Do you have a daughter ? Look to her , also . This boy once had a taste for girls lovely as she . He may change again . I offer a gloss , in the manner of our old teachers . The " boy with the name of a man " is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave him the name is Julius Caesar ; the " farrow " is one Clodia , daughter of the " pig " ( that is the nickname given her by enemies ) , Fulvia , wife of Marcus Antonius , with whom Octaviusalternately battles and reconciles . The " girl " alluded to in the last line is one Servilia , daughter of an ex-consul to whom Octavius was engaged , before ( as it is said ) under pressure from his own and Antonius 's troops , he accepted a marriage agreement with Antonius 's stepdaughter . There is , of course , more form than substance to the contract ; the girl , I understand , is only thirteen years old . But it apparently has placated those forces that want to see Octavius and Antonius on amicable terms . The poem itself , no doubt , has other local allusions that I do not understand ; it was almost certainly commissioned by one of the senatorial party who does not want a conciliation of Octavius and Antonius ; it is a vulgar thing . . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it not ?  | I am forever surprised . The name of Octavius Caesar is on everyone 's lips . He is in Rome ; he is out of Rome . He is the saviorof the nation ; he will destroy it . He will punish the murderers of Julius Caesar ; he will reward them . Whatever the truth , this mysterious youth has captured the imagination of Rome ; and I , myself , have not been immune . So , knowing that our Athenodorus has long lived in and around Rome , I took the occasion yesterday evening , after we had dined , to ask him a few questions . ( Gradually , he has unbent toward me , and now we may exchange as many as half a dozen words at a time . ) I asked him what manner of man this was , this Octavius Caesar , as he calls himself . And I showed him a copy of the poem that I sent you earlier . Athenodorus looked at it , his thin , hooked nose almost touchingthe paper , his thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed it back to me , with the same gesture that he has when he returns a paper I have given him for his emendations . " The meter is uncertain , " he said . " The matter is trivial . " I have learned patience with Athenodorus . Again , I questioned him about this Octavius . " He is a man like any other , " he said . " He will become what he will become , out of the force of his person and the accident of his fate . " I asked Athenodorus if he had ever seen this youth , or talked to him . Athenodorus frowned and growled : " I was his teacher . I was with him at Apollonia when his uncle was killed and he took the path that has led him where he is today . " For a moment I thought that Athenodorus was speaking in metaphor ; and then I saw his eyes and knew he was speaking the truth . I stammered : " You  --  you know him ? " Athenodorus almost smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not speak more of him , nor answer my questions ; he seemed to think them unimportant . He said only that his formerstudent could have become a good scholar , had he chosen to do so.  |p79So  I am even more nearly at the center of the world than I imagined . I have attended a funeral . Atia , the mother of Octavius Caesar , is dead . A herald came through the streets , announcing that the services would be held the next morning in the Forum . So I have at last set eyes upon that man whose person now is the most powerful in Rome , and hence ( I suppose ) in the world . I got to the Forum early , so that I would have a good place to see , and waited at the rostrum where Octavius Caesar was to deliverthe oration . By the fifth hour of the morning , the Forum was nearly filled . And then the procession came  --  the ushers with their flaming torches , the oboists and the buglers and the clarionists playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the mourners  --  and behind the procession , walking alone , a slight figure , whom I took at first to be a youth , since his toga was borderedwith purple ; it did not occur to me that he might be a senator . But it soon became clear that it was Octavius himself , for the crowd stirred as he passed , trying to get a better view of him . The bearers set the bier before the rostrum , the chief mourners seated themselves on little chairs in front , and Octavius Caesar walked slowly to the bier and looked for a moment at the body of his mother . Then he mounted the rostrum and looked at the people  --  a thousand , or more  --  who had gathered for the occasion . I was standing very close  --  not more than fifteen yards away . He seemed very pale , very still , almost as if he himself were the corpse . Only his eyes were alive  --  they are a most startling blue . The crowd became very quiet ; from the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city that went its way like a dumb beast . Then he began to speak . He spoke very quietly , but in a voice so clear and distinct that he could be heard by everyone who had gathered . I send you his words ; the scribes with their tablets were there , and the next day copies of the oration were in every bookstall in the city.  |p80He  said : " Rome will not again see you , Atia , you who were Rome . It is a loss that only the example of your virtue makes endurable , which tells us that our grief , if held too deeply and too long , offends the very purpose of your living . " You were a faithful wife to the father of my blood , that Gaius Octavius who was praetor and governor of Macedonia , and whose untimely death intervened between his person and the consulship of Rome . You were a stern and loving mother to your daughter , Octavia , who weeps now before your bier , and to your son , who stands before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were the dutiful and proper niece of that man who gave at last to your son the father of whom he had been cheated by fate , that Julius Caesar who was villainously murderedwithin earshot of this very spot where you so nobly lie . " Of an honored Roman name , you had in full degree those old virtues of the earth which have nurtured and sustained our nation throughout its history . You spun and wove the cloth that furnishedyour household its clothing ; your servants were as your own children ; you honored the gods of your house and of your city . Through your gentleness you had no enemy but time , who takes you now . " Oh Rome , look upon the one who lies here now , and see the best of your nature and your heritage . Soon we shall take these remains beyond the city walls , and there the funeral pyre will consume the receptacle of all that Atia was . But I charge you , citizens , do not let her virtues be entombed with her ashes . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Atia 's person be but ash , yet the better part of her will live on , entombed in the living souls of all Romans who come after her . " Atia , may the spirits of the dead keep your rest . " A long silence stayed upon the crowd . Octavius stood for a moment on the rostrum . Then he descended , and they bore the body outside the Forum , and beyond the city walls . I can not bring myself to believe what I have seen , or to give credence to what I have heard . In this chaos , there is no official news ; nothing is posted on the walls of the Senate House ; one can not even be sure that there is a Senate any more . Octavius Caesar has joined with Antonius and Lepidus in what amounts top81a military dictatorship ; and the enemies of Julius Caesar are proscribed . More than a hundred senators  --  senators  --  have been executed , their property and wealth confiscated ; and many times that number of wealthy Roman citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city , their property and wealth in the hands of the triumvirs . Merciless . Among those proscribed : Paullus , the blood brother of Lepidus . Lucius Caesar , the uncle of Antonius . And even the famous Cicero is on the published list . hhese three , and others , I imagine , have fled the city , and may escapewith their lives . The bloodiest of the work seems to be in the hands of Antonius'ssoldiers . With my own eyes I have seen the headless bodies of Roman senators littering the very Forum which a week ago was their chief glory ; and I have heard , from the safety of my hill , the screams of the rich who have waited too long to flee Rome and their riches . All except the poor , those with moderate wealth , and the friends of Caesar , walk in apprehension of what the morrow might bring , whether their names have been posted or not . It is said that Octavius Caesar sits in his home and will not show his face nor view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that it is Octavius himself who insists that the proscriptionsbe carried out ruthlessly , at once , and to the letter . One does not know what one may with safety believe . Is this the Rome that I thought I was beginning to know , after these crowded months ? Have I understood these people at all ? Athenodorus will not discuss the matter with me ; Tyrannion shakes his head sadly . Perhaps I am less the man and more the youth than I had believed . Cicero did not escape . Yesterday , on a cool , bright December afternoon , wandering among the bookstalls in the shop area behind the Forum ( it is safe to be on the streets now ) , I heard a great commotion ; and against my better judgment , out of that curiosity that will someday lead me either to fame or death , I made my way inside the Forum gates . A great crush of people was milling around the rostrum near the Senate House.  | " It 's Cicero , " someone said , and the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Not knowing what to expect , but dreading what I would see , I pushed my way through the crowd . There on the Senate rostrum , placed neatly between two severedhands , was the withered and shrunken head of Marcus TulliusCicero . Someone said that it had been placed there by order of Antonius himself . It was the same rostrum from which , only three weeks before , Octavius Caesar had spoken so gently of his mother , who had died . Now another death sat upon it ; and I could not help , at that moment , being somehow pleased that the mother had died before she had been made witness to what her son had wrought . Il . Letter : Marcus Junius Brutus to Octavius Caesar , from Smyrna ( 42 B.C. ) I can not believe that you truly apprehend the gravity of your position . I know that you bear me no love , and I would be foolishif I pretended that I bore you much more ; I do not write you out of regard for your person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not write to Antonius , for he is a madman ; I can not write to Lepidus , for he is a fool . I hope that I may be heard by you , who are neither . I know that it is through your influence that Cassius and I have been declared outlaws and condemned to exile ; but let neither of us believe that such a condemnation has more permanent force of law than can be sustained by a flustered and demoralized Senate . Let neither of us pretend that such an edict has any kind of permanenceor validity . Let us speak practically . All of Syria , all of Macedonia , all of Epirus , all of Greece , all of Asia are ours . All of the East is against you , and the power and wealth of the East is not inconsiderable . We control absolutelythe eastern Mediterranean ; therefore you can expect no aid from your late uncle 's Egyptian mistress , who might otherwise furnish wealth and manpower to your cause . And though I hear him no love , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heels from the west . Thus I do not fear for myself or my forces the war that now seems imminent.  |p83But  I do fear for Rome , and for the future of the state . The proscriptions that you and your friends have instituted in Rome hear witness to that fear , to which my personal grief must be subordinate . So let us forget proscriptions and assassinations ; if you can forgive me the death of Caesar , perhaps I can forgive you the death of Cicero . We can not be friends to each other ; neither of us needs that . But perhaps we can be friends to Rome . I implore you , do not march with Marcus Antonius . Another battle between Romans would , I fear , destroy what little virtue remains in our state . And Antonius will not march without you . If you do not march , I assure you that you will have my respect and my thanks ; and your future will be assured . If we cannotwork together out of friendship to each other , yet we may work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasten to add this . If you reject this offer of amity , I shall resist with all my strength ; and you will be destroyed . I say this with sadness ; but I say it . III . The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) And after the triumvirate was formed and the Roman enemies of Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus were put down , there yet remained in the West the forces of the pirate Sextus Pompeius , and in the East the exiled murderers of the divine Julius , that Brutus and Cassius who threatened the safety and order of Rome . True to his oath , Caesar Augustus resolved to punish the murderersof his father and restore order to the state , and deferred the matter of Sextus Pompeius to another time , taking only those actionsagainst Pompeius that were necessary for the safety of the moment . My energies at this time were devoted to enrolling and equippingin Italy those legions that were to lay siege to Brutus and Cassius in the East , and to organizing the lines of supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . Antonius was to send eight legions to Amphipolis , on the Aegean coast of Macedonia , to harass the troops of Brutus and Cassius , so that they might not find an advantage of terrain in which to fight . But Antoniusdelayed the departure of his legions , so that they were forced to find an inferior position on the low ground west of hilippi , where the army of Brutus rested in security . It became necessary for Antonius to send other legions in support of those in Macedonia , but the fleets of Brutus and Cassius hovered around the harbor at Brindisi ; so Augustus commanded me to insuresafe passage for Antonius . And with the ships and legions that I had raised in Italy , we drove through the navy of Marcus Junius Brutus and landed twelve legions of troops upon the Macedonianshore at Dyrrachium . But at Dyrrachium , Augustus fell gravely ill , and we would have waited in fear of his life ; but he bade us continue , knowing that all would be lost if we delayed our attack upon the armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country to join the beleaguered advance troops of Marcus Antonius at Amphipolis . Our way was hindered by the cavalry of Brutus and Cassius , and we suffered severe losses on c2ur journey , arriving at Amphipoliswith our troops weary and demoralized . When it became clear that the armies of Brutus and Cassius were securely entrenchedupon the high ground at Philippi , protected on the north by mountains and on the south by a marsh that stretched from the camp to the sea , I resolved to send an urgent message to Caesar Augustus ; for our task seemed hopeless to our soldiers , and I knew that their failing spirits must be revived . And so , though gravely ill , Augustus forced his way across the country to reinforce us , and went among his men on a litter , being too weak to walk ; and though his face was that of a corpse , his eyes were fierce and hard , and his voice was strong , so that the men took heart and resolve from his presence . We determined to strike boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us supplies , while Brutus and Cassius had all the lanes of the sea for their support . So while three of the legions of Augustus , under my command , pretended to be intent upon constructinga causeway across the great marsh that protected the enemy 's southern flank , thus diverting a large number of Republicantroops to attack us , the legions of Marcus Antonius struck boldly and broke through the weakened line of Cassius , and pillagedthe camp before Cassius could recover from his surprise . And Cassius , on a slight hill with a few of his officers , looked ( itp85is said ) to the north , and there saw the troops of Brutus in what he took to be full flight ; knowing that his own army was defeated , and thinking that all was lost , he despaired ; and fell upon his sword , ending his life there in the dust and blood at Philippi , taking revenge upon himself , it seemed , for the murder of the divineJulius , two years and seven months before . What Cassius did not know was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divining our plan , and knowing that the army of Augustus was dispersed in its diversionary tactic , he made haste to invest our camp , and overran it , capturing many soldiers and killing many more . Augustus himself , half-conscious in his illness and unable to move , was carried from his tent by his doctor and hidden in the marsh until the battle was over and night fell , troops of Marcus Antonius . The doctor swore that he had had a dream telling him to remove the ill Augustus , so that his life might be spared . . . . IV . Letter : Quintus Horatius Flaccus to His Father , from west of Philippi ( 42 B.C. ) My dear father , if you receive this letter , you will know that your Horace , a day ago a proud soldier in the army of Marcus Junius Brutus , at this moment , on this cold autumn night , sits in his tent , writing these words by the flickering light of a lantern , in disgrace with himself , if not with his friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him these last several months ; and if he is not happy , he is at least beginning to know who he is .. . . Today I was in my first battle ; and I must tell you at once that at the first moment of serious danger to myself I dropped my shield and sword , and I ran . Why I ever embarked upon this venture , I do not know ; and surely you are too intelligent to know either . When , out of that kindness of yours to which I have grown so used that I sometimesdo not think of it , you sent me to study in Athens year beforelast , I had no thought of engaging myself in anything so foolish as politics . Did I align myself with Brutus and accept a tribuneship in his army in a contemptible effort to rise above my station into the aristocracy ? Was Horace ashamed of being thep86son of a mere freedman ? I can not believe that that is true ; even in my youth and/ arrogance , I have known that you are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more noble and generous and loving father . It was , I believe , because in my studies I had forgotten the world , and had begun almost to believe that philosophy was true . Liberty . I joined the cause of Brutus for a word ; and I do not know what the word means . A man may live like a fool for a year , and become wise in a day . I must tell you now that I did not drop my shield and run from the battle out of mere cowardice  --  though that was no doubt part of it . But when I suddenly saw one of Octavius Caesar'ssoldiers ( or maybe Antonius 's , I do not know ) advancing towardme with naked steel flashing in his hands and in his eyes , it was as if time suddenly stood still ; and I remembered you , and all the hopes you had of my future . I remembered that you had been born a slave , and had managed to buy your freedom ; that your labor and your life were early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ease and comfort and security that you never had . And I saw that son uselessly slaughtered on an earth he had no love for , for a cause he did not understand  --  and I had a sense of what your years might have been with the knowledge of your son 's discarded life  --  and I ran . I ran over bodies of fallen soldiers , and saw their empty eyes staring at the sky which they would never see again ; and it did not matter to me whether they were friend or foe . I ran . If the fates are kind to me , I shall return to you in Italy . I shall fight no more . Tomorrow , I shall post this letter to you and make my preparations . If we are not attacked , I shall be in no danger ; if we are , I shall run again . In any event , I shall not linger at this massacre that leads to an end I can not see . I do not know who will be victorious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not know the future of our country , or my own future . Perhaps I shall have to disappoint you , and become a tax collector like yourself . It is a position , however lowly in your eyes , to which you lend dignity and honor by your presence . I am your son , Horace , and proud to be so.  | V. The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) And Brutus withdrew once more to the high ground and entrenchmentsat Philippi , whence , it became clear , he did not propose to retreat . We knew , perhaps better than Brutus , that each IIav of waiting cost us dearly , for our supplies were running low ; nothing could be transported over the sea controlled by Brutus 's navy ; behind us were the flat and barren plains of Macedonia , and before us the hostile and barren hills of Greece . Thus we made to be copied sheets of reproaches to the officers of Brutus 's army , taunting them with their timidity and cowardice ; and at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldierscould not even sleep in honor , but dozed fitfully in their shame . For three weeks Brutus waited , until at last his men , chafing beneath the burden of their inaction , would wait no longer ; and Brutus , fearful that his army would be depleted by desertions , orderedhis men to descend from the entrenchments that might have saved them , and to attack our camp . In the late afternoon they came down from the hill like a northern storm ; no cries or shouts escaped their lips , and we heard only the clump of hooves and the pad of feet in the dust that came with them like a cloud . I ordered our line to give way before the initial attack ; and as the enemy streamed into us , we closed the lines on either side , so that he had to fight on two flanks at once . And we broke the army in two , and each of those parts into two again , so that he could not re-form himself to withstand our attacks . By nightfall , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wounded , and watched impassively the bodies that did not move . Brutus escaped with what remained of his legions , and made his way to the wilderness beyond the entrenchments at Philippi , which we had invested . He would have attacked again with what remained of his army , but his officers refused to risk themselves ; and in the early dawn , the day after the Ides of November , on a lonely hillock overlooking the carnage of his will and resolve , with a few of his faithful officers , he fell upon his sword ; and the army of the Republic was no more.  |p88Thus  was the murder of Julius Caesar avenged , and thus did the chaos of treas n and faction give way to the years of order and peace , under the Emperor of our state , Gaius Octavius Caesar , now the August . VI . Letter : Gaius Cilnius Maecenas to Titus Livius ( 13 B.C. ) After Philippi , slowly , with many stops along the way , more dead than alive , he came back to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it remained for him to heal the nation that was shattered within . My dear Livy , I can not tell you the shock I had upon seeing him for the first time after those many months , when they carried him in secret to his house on the Palatine . I , of course , had remained in Rome during the fighting , according to Octavius 's orders , so that I could keep an eye on things and do what I could to prevent Lepidus , either out of conspiracy or incompetence , from wholly disrupting the internal government of Italy . He was not quite twenty-two years old that winter when he returned from the fighting , but I swear to you he looked double  --  treble  --  that age . His face was waxen , and , slight though he always was , he had lost so much weight that his skin sagged upon his bones . He had the strength to speak only in a hoarse whisper . I looked at him , and I despaired of his life . " Do not let them know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the uttering of that phrase had exhausted him . " Do not let them know of my illness . Neither the people nor Lepidus . " " I will not , my friend , " I told him . The illness had , in fact , begun the year before , during the time of the proscriptions , and had grown steadily worse ; and though the physicians who attended him had been paid handsomely and threatened with their livelihood , if not their lives , for any breach of secrecy , rumors of the illness had crept out . The doctors ( a dreadful lot , then as now ) might as well not have been called in ; they were able to do nothing except prescribe noxious herbs and treatments of heat and cold . He was able to eat almost nothing , and upon more than one occasion he had vomited blood . Yet as his body had weakened , it seemed that his will had hardened , sop89that he drove himself even more fiercely in his illness than he had in his health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " will not return yet to Rome . He has gone into the East to gather booty and to strengthen his position . I agreed to it  --  I would prefer to have hint steal from the Asians and the Egyptians than from the Romans .. . . I believe he expects me to die ; and though he hopes l or it , I suspect he does n't want to be in Italy when it happens . " I lc lay back on his bed , breathing shallowly , his eyes closed . At length he regained his strength , and said : " Give me the news of the city . " " Rest , " I said . " We shall have time when you are stronger . " " The news , " he said . " Though my body can not move , my mind can . " There were bitter things I had to tell him , but I knew that he would not have forgiven me had I sweetened them . I said : " Lepidus negotiates secretly with the pirate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of allying himself with Pompeius against either you or Antonius , whichever proves weaker . I have t lie evidence ; but if we confront him with it , he will swear that he negotiates only to bring peace to Rome . . . . Out of Philippi , Antonius is the hero and you are the coward . Antonius 's pig of a wife and his vulture of a brother have spread the stories  --  while you cowered and quaked in fear in the salt marsh , Antonius bravely punished the enemies of Caesar . Fulvia makes speeches to the soldiers , warning that you will not pay them the bounties t hat Antonius promised ; while Lucius goes about the countryside stirring up the landowner and the farmer with rumors that you will confiscate their properties to settle the veterans . Do you Want to hear more ? " He even smiled a little . " If I must , " he said . " The state is very near to being bankrupt . Of the few taxes t hat Lepidus can collect , a trickle goes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is said , to Fulvia , who , it is also said , is preparing to raise independent legions , in addition to those that rightfully belong to Antonius . I have no proof of this , but I imagine it is true . . . . So it would seem that you got the lesser bargain in Rome . " " I would prefer the weakness of Rome to all the power of thep90East , " he said , " though I am sure this is not what Antonius had in mind . He expects that if I do not die , I will go under with the problems here . But I will not die , and we will not go under . " He raised himself a little . " We have much to do . " And the next day , in his weakness , he arose from his bed , and put his illness aside as if it were of no moment and no account . We had much to do , he said . . . . My dear Livy , that admirablehistory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays , the triumphs and defeats , the joys and despairs of the years following Philippi ? It can not do so , and no doubt it should not . But I must not digress , even to praise you ; for you will scold me again . You have asked me to be more particular about the duties I performed for our Emperor , as if I were worthy of a place in your history . You honor me beyond my merits . Yet I am pleased that I am remembered , even in my retirement from public affairs . The duties that I performed for our Emperor . . . I must confessthat some of them seem to me now ludicrous , though of course they did not seem so then . The marriages , for example . Through the influence and by the edicts of our Emperor , it is now possible for a man of substance and ambition to contract a marriage on grounds that are rational if " rational " is not too contradictory a word to describe such an odd and ( I sometimesthink ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I speak  --  in Rome , at least , and to those of publicinvolvement . One married for advantage and political necessity  --  as , indeed , I myself did , though my Terentia was on occasion an amusing companion . I must say , I was rather good at such arrangements  --  and I must also confess that as it turned out none were advantageous or even necessary . I have always suspected that it was that knowledgewhich led Octavius , some years later , to institute those not altogether successful marriage laws , rather than the kind of " morality " imputed to them . He has often chided me about my advicein those early days . For it was invariably wrong . For example : The first marriage I contracted for him was in the very early days , before the formation of the triumvirate . The girl was Servilia , the daughter of that P. Servilius Isauricus who , when Cicero opposed Octavius after Mutina , agreed to stand forp91senior consul with Octavius against Cicero  --  and the marriage to his daughter was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our arms , if that became necessary . As it turned out , Servilius was impotent in his dealings with Cicero and was of no help to us ; the marriage never took place . The second was even more ludicrous than the first . It was to Clodia , daughter of Fulvia and stepdaughter to Marcus Antonius , and it was a part of the compact that formed the triumvirate ; the soldiers wanted it , and we saw no reason to deny them their whim , however meaningless it was . The girl was thirteen years old , and as ugly as her mother . Octavius saw her twice , I believe , and she never set foot in his house . As you know , the marriage did nothing to quiet Fulvia or Antonius ; they continued their plotting and their treason , so that after Philippi , when Antonius was in the East and Fulvia was openly threatening another civil war against Octavius , we had to make our position clear by effectinga divorce . It was , however , my responsibility for the third contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with Scribonia , and it was accomplished within the year after his divorce from Clodia , during our most desperate months , when it seemed that we would either be crushed by the Antonian uprisings in Italy , or by the encroachment of Sextus Pompeius from the south . In what seems now a too desperate effort at conciliation , I went to Sicily to negotiate with Sextus Pompeius  --  an impossible task , for Pompeius was an impossible man . He was a bit mad , I think  --  more like an animal than a human . He was an outlaw , and that in more than the legal sense ; he is one of the few men with whom I have had converse who so repelled me that I had difficulty in dealing with him . I know , my dear Livy , that you admiredhis father ; but you never met either of them , and you certainlydid not know his son . . . . In any event , I talked to Pompeius , and extracted what I thought was an agreement  --  and sealed the compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the younger sister of Pompeius 's fatherin-law . Scribonia , Scribonia . . . . She has always seemed to me the epitome of womankind : coldly suspicious , politely ill-tempered , and narrowly selfish . It is a wonder that my friend ever did forgive me for that arrangement . Perhaps it was because from that marriage came the one thing that my friend loves as much as he loves Rome  --  his daughter , his Julia . He divorced Scribonia on the day of his daughter 's birth , and it is a wonder that he ever married again . But he did marry again , and it was an arrangement in which I had no part . . . . As it turned out , the marriage to Scribonia was fraudulent to begin with ; for as I was negotiating with Pompeius , he himself was already deep in negotiations with Antonius , and the marriage contract was a mere ruse to lull our suspicions . Such , my dear Livy , was the nature of politics in those days . But I must say ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back on it all , these affairs did have their humorousside . For my responsibility in arranging only one marriage have I ever felt any shame ; even now , I can not take it as lightly as I ought to be able to do  --  though I suppose no great harm was done . At about the time I was negotiating with Pompeius and arrangingthe marriage with Scribonia , the barbarian Moors , aroused by Fulvia and Lucius Antonius , rose up against our governorin Outer Spain ; our generals in Africa , again at the instigationof Fulvia and Lucius , began to war with each other ; Lucius pretended that his life had been threatened , and marched with his ( and Fulvia 's ) legions on Rome . They were repulsed there by our friend Agrippa , and surrounded in the town of Perusia , whose inhabitants ( Pompeians and Republicans , mostly ) aided them with vigor and enthusiasm . We really did n't know how much a part in all this Marcus Antonius had , though we suspected ; therefore we did not dare destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marcus Antonius would use this as a pretext to attack us from the east ; and that if he were innocent , he would misunderstandour action , and take revenge upon us . We did not punish Lucius , but we showed little mercy to those who had aided him , putting the most treacherous to death and exiling the less dangerous  --  though we let the ordinary citizens go free , and even recompensed them for the property we destroyed . Among those exiled ( and this , my dear Livy , will appeal to your perhaps overdeveloped sense of irony ) was one Tiberius Claudius Nero , who was allowed to make his way to Sicily with his newborn son , Tiberius , and his very young wife , Livia.  |p93During  all the months of the turmoil in Italy , we had written often to Antonius , trying to describe the activities of his wife and brother and trying to ascertain his part in the disturbances ; and t bough we received letters from Antonius , none of them replied to those we had sent , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , when we wrote most urgently ; and few of the sea lanes were open ; it is possible that he did not receive them . In : Inv event , the spring and part of the summer passed without clear word from him ; and then we got an urgent message from Brindisi that Antonius 's fleet was sailing toward the harbor , and that the navy of Pompeius was coming up from the north to join him . And we learned that some months earlier , Fulvia had sailed to Athens to meet her husband . We did not know what to expect , and yet we had no choice . Weak as we were , with our legions scattered against the various troubles on our borders and in our nation , we marched toward Brindisi , fearful that Antonius had landed and was leading his soldiers to meet us . But we learned that the city of Brindisi had refused to let Antonius through the harbor gates , and so we encampedand awaited what would happen . Had Antonius attacked in full force , we no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , nor did we . Our own soldiers were famishedand ill-equipped ; the soldiers of Antonius were weary with their travels and wanted only to see their families in Italy . Had either side been foolish enough to press the issue , we probably would have had a mutiny . And then an agent that we slipped among the Antonian forces returned with some startling news . Antonius and Fulvia had quarreled bitterly at Athens ; Antonius had left in a rage ; and now Fulvia , suddenly and inexplicably , was dead . We encouraged some of our trusted soldiers to fraternize with the troops of Antonius ; and soon deputations from both sides approachedtheir respective leaders and demanded that Antonius and Octavius once more reconcile their differences , so that not again would Roman be pitted against Roman . And thus the two leaders met , and another war was averted . Antonius protested that Fulvia and his brother had acted without his authority , and Octavius pointed out that he had taken no revengeon either of them for their actions , out of regard for theirp94relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all previous enemies of Rome was declared ; and a marriage was arranged . The marriage was negotiated by me ; and it was between Antoniusand Octavia , the older sister of our Emperor , who had been widowed only a few months ago , and left with her infant son , Marcellus . My dear Livy , you know my tastes  --  but I almost believe I could have loved women , had many of them been like Octavia . I admired her then as I do now  --  she was very gentle and withoutguile , she was quite beautiful , and she was one of the two women I have ever known who had both an extensive knowledge and deep understanding of philosophy and poetry , the other being Octavius 's own daughter , Julia . Octavia was not a plaything , you understand . My old friend Athenodorus used to say that had she been a man , and less intelligent , she could have becomea great philosopher . I was with Octavius when he explained the necessity to his sister  --  of whom he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the eye when he spoke . But Octavia merely smiled at him and said : " If it must be done , my brother , it must be done ; I shall try to be a good wife to Antonius and remain a good sister to you . " " It is for Rome , " Octavius said . " It is for us all , " his sister said . It was necessary , I suppose ; we hoped that such a marriage might lead us to a lasting peace ; we knew that it would give us a few years . But I must say , I still feel that twinge of regret and sorrow ; Octavia must have had some rather bad times . Though , as it turned out , Antonius was a rather intermittent husband . That might have made it more endurable for her . Yet she never spoke harshly of Marcus Antonius , even in later years.  |p95I  . Letter : Marcus Antonius to Octavius Caesar ; fromAthens ( 39 B.C. ) Antonius to Octavius , greetings . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruined my brother 's career , because their actions had displeased you . To cement our joint rule , I married your sister , who , though a good woman , is not to my taste . To assure you of my good faith , I sent Sextus Pompeius and his navy back to his Sicily , though ( as you well know ) he would have joined me against you . To augment your power , I agreed to strip Lepidus of all the provinces he held , save Africa . I agreed , even , after my marriage to your sister , to he designatedPriest to the deified Julius  --  though it seemed odd to be priest to an old friend , a man with whom I have whored and drunk , and though my acceptance of the priesthood was more advantageous to your name than to mine . Finally , I have absented myself from my homeland , so that I may raise the money in the East that will insure our future authority , and to make some ' order out of the chaos into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know what you expect of me . If I have allowed the Greeks to pretend to themselves that I am the revived Bacchus ( or do you prefer Dionysus ? ) , it is so that their love for me will give me some control over them . You criti/cize me for " playing the Greek " and for assuming the role of the Incarnate Bacchus at the Festival of Athena ; and yet you must know that when I agreed to do so , I insisted that the Celestial Athena bring me a dowry  --  and that by that insistence , I have enriched our treasury by more than I could have done by levyingtaxes , and have also escaped the resentment that would have inevitably resulted from such a levy . As for the Egyptian matters that you so delicately raise : first , it is true that I have accepted certain of the Queen 's subjects as my aides . This is both helpful to my task , and necessary to my diplomacy . But even if all this were merely for my own pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ammonius you know yourself , for he was a friend of your late uncle ( or " father , " as you now may call him )  --  and he serves me as faithfully as he served Juliusand as he served his Queen . As for Epimachos , whom you call a mere " soothsayer , " such a designation reveals ( if you will forgive me ) a profound ignorance about these Eastern matters . This " mere soothsayer " is an extraordinarily important man : he is the High Priest of Heliopolis , the Incarnation of Thoth , and the Keeper of the Book of Magic . He is a good deal more important than any of our own " priests , " and he is useful to me ; and besides , he is an amusing fellow . Second , there was never any secret about my connection with the Queen two years ago in Alexandria . But I recall to you that that was two years ago , before either of us had any notion that I might one day become your brother-in-law . And you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleopatra has presentedme ; they may or may not be my own ; whether they are or not is no matter . I have not made secret , either , that I have left children all over the world ; these new ones would mean neither more nor less to me than the others . When I have time from my duties , I take my pleasure , and I take it where I can find it . I shall continue to do so . At least , my dear brother , I do not hide my propensities ; I am no hypocrite ; and your own affairs , I should point out , are not so well hidden as you imagine . You should know me better than to think ( if , indeed , you do think it , as you pretend ) that my liaison with Cleopatra had anything to do with my confirmation of her sovereignty in Egypt . For if this confirmation is to my advantage , so it is to yours.  |p97Egv|pt  is the richest of the Eastern nations , and its treasury will be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only Eastern nation that has any semblance of an army , and at least a part of this army will be at our disposal . Finally , it is easier to deal with a %Ingle strong monarch who feels some security in his ( or her ) positionthan with half a dozen weak ones who feel none . These things , and many others , should be clear to you , who arc no fool . I will not accept the terms of whatever game it is you think you are playing. ll . Letter : Marcus Antonius to Gaius Sentius Tavus ( 38 B.C. ) I hat bloody and outrageous little hypocrite ! I am stretched between laughter and anger  --  laughter at the hypocrisy , and anger at what his hypocrisy might conceal . Does he imagine that I am without my sources of information here in Athens ? I am not shocked by anything he does , and I do not take that high moral tone that he loves to affect . He may divorceas many a Scribonia as he likes , even on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scribonia ) must be his ; he may even take within the week another wife , who is already pregnant by her former husband . He may perform this public scandal ( and even the more private ones that you report to me ) , and he will get no remonstrances from me ; he may be as bizarre as he likes in his private preferences . But I know my recent " brother " ; and I know that he does nothing from passion or whim . He is such a cold-blooded fish that I must almost admire him . It must be clear to everyone that his divorce of Scribonia signifiesthat we no longer have an understanding with her kinsman , Sextus Pompeius . What can I make of this ? Why was I not consulted ? Does it mean that we are to make war on Sextus ? Or will Octavius go it alone ? And what of his new wife , this Livia ? You tell me that Octaviusonce exiled her husband from Italy , because he was a Republicanand opposed him at Perusia . Does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor with the remnants of the RepublicanParty ? I do not know what all of this means .. . . Youp98must write often , Sentius ; I must be kept informed , and I can trust few , nowadays . I wish I were in Rome ; but I can not leave my task here . I have been trying to persuade myself that the kind of life I am now leading is worth the trouble . My present wife is as cold and proper in fact as her brother is in pretense . And though I can find my pleasure here and there , I have to be so discreet that the pleasure is reduced almost to nothing . Daily , I am tempted to send her packing ; but I have no cause , she is with child , and to divorceher now would cause a breach with her brother that I cannotafford. 111 . Extracts from Reports : Epimachos , High Priest of Heliopolis , to Cleopatra , the Incarnate Isis and Queen of the Worlds ofEgypt ( 40  --  37 B.C. ) Greetings , Revered Queen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation , Marcus Antonius diced with Octavius Caesar . For nearly three hours they played , and Antonius lost consistently , winning perhaps one out of four throws . Octavius is well pleased , Antonius annoyed . I cast the sands , and went into a trance , from which I told the story of Eurystheus and that Heracleswho became his servant because of the perfidy of the gods . Suggest that in your next letter to him , you refer to some demeaningtask you dreamed he had to perform for someone weaker and less worthy than himself . I was grave and portentous ; you must be humorous and light . My auguries have been to no avail ; he is married to Octavia , the sister of his enemy . It is the pledge that will satisfy the populaceand the soldiers . I send you two waxen effigies . You are to find in your palace a remote room which has but one door . You are to place the effigy of Antonius on the side of the room where there is a door , the effigyof Octavia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this with your own hands ; let no one assist you . Then you are to have built between the figures a heavy wall , extending from the floor to the ceiling ; there must be no fissure between the two . Each day , at sun 's rising and sun 's setting , you are to have myp99priest , Epiktetas , perform the spell outside the room . He will know what to do . We go to Athens with Octavia , who is now with child and will deliver within three months . I have presented to Antonius a pair of identical greyhounds , which he has raced and of which he has become inordinately fond . On the day that Octavia 's child is born , I shall cause the dogs to disappear . You must write him within the next few weeks of a dream that you had about the twins . The child that Octavia has delivered is a daughter ; thus there is no potential heir to his name . The God of the Sun has bowed to our will and has heeded our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Octavia , who takes the part of her husband against her brother . Antonius 's suspicions of her are almost gone , and he seems grudgingly fond of her , though he is still made impatient by her quietness and calm . Does Epiktetas perform faithfully the spell , as you instructedhim ? He has had a dream of being hound to a couch while his tent burned around him . The soldiers of his army walked past the burning tent , and did not heed his calls , as if they did not hear him . Finally he burst his bonds , but the fire was around him so fiercely that he could not see which way to turn to escape . He awoke in fear , and called for me . I fasted for three days , and gave him the portents of the dream . I told him that the fire was the intrigue in Rome , heaped and kindledby Octavius Caesar . That he was in a tent , I said , revealed two things : his position ( he has no secure and permanent place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a soldier ) . That he Akas bound to his couch , I said , signified that by his inactivity he had betrayed his nature and allowed himself to become weak and hence impotent to the intrigues against him and to the circumstanceof fate . That his soldiers did not heed his calls revealed that by his betrayal of his nature , he had lost control of his men ;  | that he is properly a man of action , not of words ; that men would bend to his deeds , not his talk . He has become thoughtful , and he studies maps . I say nothing to him , but I believe he is again considering taking up arms against the Parthians . For this , he will come to know that he needs your aid . Discreetly , let him know that it is at his disposal . Thus , you may draw him again to our cause , and insure the futureglory of Egypt . IV . Letter : Cleopatra to Marcus Antonius , from Alexandria ( 37 B.C. ) My dear Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgiven yours . And you must forgive me , too , if I write you now as a woman , rather than as the Queen who is your faithful ally and whose strength is ever at your disposal . For I have been most gravely ill these last few months , and have not wished to cause you concern for my infirmities ; indeed , I should not write you now , had not my frailty and my heart overcome my Queenhood . Sleep is reluctant to cover my eyes ; my strength is stolen by fevers that even the skills of my physician , Olympus , can not allay ; I take little food ; and despair is like a serpent that creeps into the emptiness of my spirit . Oh , Marcus , how weary all this must make you ! Yet I know your kindness , and know that you will indulge the weakness of an old friend , who thinks of you often and remembers many things . Perhaps it is that remembering , rather than the advice of Olympus , which has persuaded me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the temple there , the Supreme God , Amen-Ra , will take away my illness and return my strength . You used to tease me about my regard for these Egyptian gods ; perhaps you were right in that , as you were in so many things . For I almost refused him ; and then I remembered ( it seems so long ago ) another spring , when you and I floated down the Nile and side by side lay on our couch and watched the fertilebanks slip by and felt upon our bodies the cool river breeze ; and the farmers and herdsmen knelt , and even the goats and cat/tle seemed to pause in obeisance to us , raising their heads to watch our passing . And Memphis , where they held the bullfights in our honor , and Hermopolis and Akhetaton , where we were God and Goddess , Osiris and Isis . And then the Thebes of the Hundred Gates , and the drowsy days and gay nights . . . Remembering this , I felt the beginnings of strength return to me ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the temple of Amen-Ra . But if I am returned to health , it will be from the nourishment I take from these memories along the way , which I hold as dear as my life . V. Letter : Marcus Antonius to Octavius Caesar ( 37 B.C. ) You have broken our treaty with Sextus Pompeius , a treaty to which I pledged my word ; it is rumored that you intend war upon him , though you have not consulted me in the matter ; you intrigue against my reputation , though I have done neither you nor your sister any harm ; you seek to subvert from me the little strength I have in Italy , though I have given you , out of my loyalty , much of the power you now have ; in short , you have repaid my loyalty with betrayal , my honor with your treachery , my generosity with your self-interest . You may do what you want in Rome ; I will no longer be concerned . When we agreed to extend the triumvirate earlier this year , I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not . I send your sister and her children to you . You may inform her upon her arrival that she is not to return to me . Though she is a good woman , I want no tie with your house . As for divorce , that I will leave entirely to your discretion . I know that you will decidethat matter in terms of your own interest . I do not care . I shall not dissemble with you ; I have no need to ; I fear neither you nor your intrigues . I shall begin my Parthian campaign this spring , without the legionsyou promised and did not deliver to me . I have summoned Cleopatra to Antioch . She will supply the troops that I need . If Rome is dying in the web that you weave around her , Egypt will thrive in the power that I will give her . I bequeath the corpse to you ; for myself , I prefer the living body.  | VI . Letter : Marcus Antonius to Cleopatra ( 37 B.C. ) Empress of the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  take this letter from Fonteius Capito ; I have asked him to deliver it into your hands alone . You may trust him as you have trusted me , and question him about all those matters upon which this letter does not touch . I am  --  as you have so often and wisely observed  --  a man of action , not of words . Thus my words can not tell you of the despair I felt when I learned you were ill , nor of the joy that overwhelmed sorrow when I learned that on the journey back from the Thebes that we both remember , your health was returning , like a bird returninghome . You wonder how I know this ? I must confess  --  I have had my benevolent spies in your midst , who , out of love for us both and out of respect for my deep solicitude , have kept me informed of your welfare . For despite the circumstances that have kept us apart , my concern for you has never wavered ; and if sometimes I have not written , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness would give me a pain of loss I could not bear . But as Fonteius will tell you , I have awakened as if from a dream . Oh , my little kitten , who are a Queen , do you know the bitter cost to me of our long separation ? Of course you do  --  and I know you understand . I remember your telling me of your unhappiness when , as a young girl , for reasons of dynasty , your father would have wed you to your young brother so that you might have begotten children to continue the line of the Ptolemies . Yet your womanhood prevailed ; and even as an Isis must become a woman , so must a Hercules become a man . It is too burdensome always to remain God and Goddess , King and Queen . Will you let Fonteius bring you to Antioch , where I will be awaiting you ? Even if your love for me has gone , I must see you again , so that I may see for myself that you are well . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you are to refuse the matters of the heart . Come to me , if only out of respect for what we both must remember.  | VII . The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) After the battle of Philippi , the triumvir Antonius being occupied with his adventures in the Eastern world , it remained for Caesar Augustus to repair the harms of the civil wars , and to bring order into the Italy of Rome . He walked among the treasonsof his colleague , Antonius , and did not falter ; at Perusia , the armies under my command quieted the insurrection raised by Antonius 's brother Lucius ; and Caesar Augustus , in his mercy , spared his life , though his crime had been grave . But of all the impediments that lay between Caesar Augustus and the order that was necessary for the salvation of Rome , the gravest was that raised by the traitor and pirate , Sextus Pompeius , who unlawfully governed the islands of Sicily and Sardinia , and whose ships roamed the seas at will , plundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome 's survival . So serious were the depredations of Sextus Pompeius that the city came to be in danger of famine ; and in their desperation and fear , the people rioted in the streets , to no end save to relieve themselves of a creeping despair . Caesar Augustus , in his pity for the people , offered Pompeius terms ; for we had not the strength to meet him in battle . A treaty was signed , and for a period grain flowed back into Rome ; and I was sent by Caesar Augustus to Transalpine Gaul as governor , where I was to organize the Gallic legions against the growing hostility of the barbarian tribes before returning to Rome the following year as consul . But hardly had the treaty been signed before Sextus Pompeius began conspiring with Antonius , and soon the treaty was broken , and Sextus resumed his piracy and plunder . Caesar Augustus recalledme to Rome before the year was out ; for the sake of starvingRome , we had no choice but to prepare for war . The genius of Rome is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at home upon the sea . And yet we knew that if we were to overcomeSextus Pompeius , we must do so upon the sea ; for like all unnatural creatures , that was his habitat , and there he would lurk , even if we drove him off the land he held . Caesar Augustus and the Senate appointed me admiral of the Roman navy , and gave to me the charge of establishing for the first time in our history a formidable Roman fleet . I commissioned to be built some three hundred vessels , to augment those few already under the command of Caesar Augustus ; and to man these vessels , Augustus gave freedom to twenty thousand slaves in exchange for their faithful service . And since we could not train upon the open sea  --  for sometimes the vessels of the pirate Pompeius sailed within easy sight of the Italian shore  --  I made to be cut a deep channelbetween the lakes of Lucrine and Avernus at Naples , so that they became one body of water ; and by reinforcing the Via Herculeana ( said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and opening it at either end to the sea , I caused to be formed that which is now called the Bay of Julius , in honor of my commander and my friend . And in that hay , protected by land on all sides from the weather and from unfriendly ships , for the year of my consulship , and into the year beyond , I trained the navy that was to confront the seasoned veterans of the pirate Pompeius . And in the summer we were ready . On the first day of that month which had recently been named in honor of the Divine Julius , we set sail southward for Sicily , where we were to be joined by the auxiliary fleets of Antonius from the east and those of Lepidus from the north . Unseasonable and violent storms met us , and we suffered losses ; and though the fleets of Antonius and Lepidus sought shelter , the Roman fleets of Augustus , under his command and my own , sailed through the storms ; and though we were delayed , we met the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so severely punished them that they were forced to withdraw to the shallow waters where we could not follow ; and we invested the town of Mylae , whence the pirate forces had drawn many of their supplies . Unprepared for our strength , the ships of Pompeius broke beforeour assault ; with the aid of a grappling hook that I had devised , we were able to board many of the ships , and we captured more than we sank , adding them to our growing fleet . And we captured the coastal fortresses of Hiera and Tyndarus , and it seemed to Pompeius that unless he could conclude a decisive victory , and destroy our ships , all the coastal strongholds from which he drew his supplies would fall into our hands ; and he would be lost.  |p105Thus  he hazarded his fleet in all its strength , in waters favorableto his own ships , to defend the port city of Naulochus , which we would have to take before we could secure Mylae , a few miles to the south , the first stronghold we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevail against our heavier ships ; though he could outmaneuver us , he was reduced at last to attempting to sweep away the banks of oars by which we were moved , though by this effort he lost more ships than he disabled . Twenty-eight Pompeian vessels were sunk with all their crews ; the rest were captured , or suffered such damage as to snake them inoperable . Only seventeen ships of the entire fleet escapedour assault , and they sailed eastward , with Sextus Pompeius aboard and in pitiful command . It is said by some that Pompeius sailed eastward in the hope of joining the absent triumvir Antonius , whom he wished to incite anew against Caesar Augustus ; it is said by others that he wished to join with Phraates , the barbarian king of Parthia , who warred against our Eastern provinces . In any event , he made his way to the province of Asia , and resumed his occupation of robbery and pillage . There he was captured by the centurion Titius , whose life Pompeius himself once had spared , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devastation of piracy at last put down in the seas that surrounded the Italy of Rome . Weary from battle , our forces yet had to invest the other coastal cities of Sicily which had supplied Pompeius , the chief of which was Messina , where most of Pompeius 's land armies were stationed . According to the orders of Caesar Augustus , we were to blockade this city , and await his arrival to meet the battle , if there were to be one . But at this time , and at last , the vessels commanded by the triumvir Lepidus , who had joined in none of the battles at sea , met our ships at Messina ; and despite my deliveranceto him of the orders of Caesar Augustus , he entered into negotiations with the local commander ; and refreshed by his peaceful cruise from Africa , he informed me that by his own authorityhe relieved me of my command ; and he received the surrenderof all the Pompeian legions in Messina , requiring pledges of fealty to his own authority , and added those legions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , we awaited the arrival of Caesar Augustus.  |p106VIII  .

Letter : Gains Cihiius Maecenas to Titus Livius ( 13 B.C. ) My dear Livy , I got the news just this morning  --  Marcus Aemilius Lepidus is dead at Circeii , where he has been living in his retirement and , I suppose , shame , for the past twenty-four years . He was our enemy  --  yet after so long , the death of an old enemy is curiously like the death of an old friend . I am saddened , as was our Emperor , who informed me of the death and told me that he will allow a public funeral in Rome , a funeral in the old style , if his descendants wish it . And so , after all thesep107cars , Lepidus returns to Rome and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly a quarter of a century ago . . . . It occurs to me that that is one of the things that I have not written to you about . Had I done so a week ago , I would no doubt have gone about it rather lightly ; it would have seemed to Inc one of those half-humorous memories out of the past . But this death has cast a different light upon that memory , and it seems to Inc now oddly sad . After a long and disheartening and bloody struggle , the pirate Sextus Pompeius was defeated  --  by the fleet and legions under the command of Marcus Agrippa and Octavius , and supposedlyith the aid of Lepidus . Lepidus and Agrippa were to blockade the city of Messina on the Sicilian coast , so that the scattered fleet of Sextus Pompeius would have no safe harbor to repair the damagesdone by Agrippa and Octavius . But the commander of the city , one Plinius , having heard of the defeat suffered by Sextus , and at the behest of Lepidus , surrendered the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender , and , despite Agrippa 's remonstrances , put the legions under his own command ; and he allowed the Pompeian as well as his own fourteen legions to plunder and sack the city which , by its surrender , had put itself under his protection . You understand , my dear Livy , that war is never pretty , and that one must expect a certain brutality from soldiers . But Agrippa came with Octavius into the city after the night of the plunder ; and Agrippa has told me a little , though our Emperor would never speak of it . The houses of the rich and poor were burned without discriminationor reason ; hundreds of innocent townspeople , who had been guilty of nothing save the misfortune of having their town occupied by the Pompeian legions  --  old men , and women , and even children  --  were slaughtered and tortured by the troops . Agrippa told me that even in the late morning after the carnage , when he and our Emperor rode into the city , they could hear like a single sound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our Emperor confronted Lepidus at last , after havingdispatched many of his men to care for the suffering townspeople , he was so moved by sorrow that he could not speak ; and poor , ignorant Lepidus , mistaking that silence for weakness andp108in the hysteria of what he must have conceived to be an invinciblepower afforded him by his sudden acquisition of the twentytworested and well-fed legions under his command , peremptorily ordered his colleague , to whom he spoke in contemptuous and threatening tones , to quit Sicily ; and said that if he wished to remaina triumvir , he must be content with only Africa , which he ( Lepidus ) was willing to relinquish to him . It was an extraordinaryspeech . . . . Poor Lepidus , I have said . It was a strange delusion he had . Our Emperor did not speak in reply to Lepidus 's preposterous claim . The next day , accompanied only by Agrippa and six bodyguards , he came into the city , and went to the small Forum , and spoke to the soldiers of Lepidus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the promises of Lepidus were empty without his assent , and that they were in danger of putting themselves beyond the protection of Rome if they persisted in following a false leader . He had the name of Caesar , and that probably would have been enough to lead the soldiers to reason , even without Lepidus 's fatal error . For Lepidus 's own guard , in Lepidus 's presence , made to attack the person of our Emperor , who might indeed have been gravely wounded or even killed , had not one of his guards interposed himself between the Emperorand a hurled javelin , giving his life . Agrippa told me that as the guard fell at our Emperor 's feet , a strange hush fell upon the crowd , and that even the bodyguards of Lepidus remained still and did not pursue their advantage . Octaviuslooked with sorrow upon the body of his fallen guard , and then lifted his eyes to the multitude before him . He said quietly , but in a voice that carried to all the soldiers : " Thus by leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who offered harm to none of his comrades , is dead in a foreign land . " He had his other guards pick up the body and bear it aloft ; and in front of the guard , unprotected , as if at a funeral , he walked through the crowd ; and the soldiers parted before him like stalks of grain before the wind . And one by one the legions of Sextus Pompeius deserted Lepidus , and joined our forces outside the city ; and then the legionsp109of Lepidus , despising the sluggishness and ineptness of their leader , came to our side ; until Lepidus , with only a few who remainedloyal to him , was helpless inside the city walls . Lepidus must have expected to he captured and executed , yet Octavius did not move . One would have thought that in such a position he would have chosen suicide , but Lepidus did not . Rather , he sent a messenger to Octavius , and asked pardon , and asked that his life be spared . Octavius agreed , and set a condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , Octavius orderedan assembly of all the officers and centurions of the legions of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Sextus Pompeius , and the officersand centurions of his own legions , in the Forum of Messina . And Lepidus made a public plea for mercy . With his sparse gray hair blowing in the wind , in a plain toga with none of the colors of office , without attendants , he walked slowly the length of the Forum and mounted the platform where Octavius stood . There he knelt and asked forgiveness for his crimes , and made public relinquishment of all his powers . Agrippa has said that his face was without color or expression , and that his voice was like the voice of one in a trance . Octavius said : " This man is pardoned , and he will walk with safety among you . No harm is to come to him . He will be exiled from Rome , but he is under the protection of Rome ; and he is stripped of all his titles save that of Pontifex Maximus , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Without saying more , Lepidus rose and went to his quarters . And Agrippa told me a curious thing . As he was walking away , Agrippa said to Octavius : " You have given him worse than death . " And Octavius smiled . " Perhaps , " he said . " But perhaps I have given him a kind of happiness . " . . . I wonder what his last years were like , in his exile at Circeii . Was he happy ? When one has had power in his grasp , and has failed to hold it , and has remained alive  --  what does one be-come ?  |p110X  . The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) And we returned to Rome and the gratitude of the Roman people , whom we had saved from starvation . In the temples of the cities of Italy , from Arezzo in the north to Vibo in the south , statues of Octavius Caesar were raised , and he was worshiped by the people as a god of the hearth . And the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Forum a statue of gold , in commemoration of the order that had been restored to sea and land . To celebrate the occasion , Octavius Caesar remitted the debts and taxes of all the people , and gave them assurance of final peace and freedom when Marcus Antonius had subdued the Parthians in the East . And upon my own head , after giving thanks to Rome for its steadfastness , he placed the crown of gold adorned with images of our ships . It was an honor given to no one before and to no one since . Thus while Antonius in the distant East hunted the barbarian Parthian tribes , in Italy Caesar Augustus devoted himself to securingthe borders of his homeland , neglected by the many years of dissension in which it had suffered . We conquered the Pannoniantribes and drove the tribal invaders from the coast of Dalmatia , so that Italy was secure from any threat from the north . In these campaigns , Octavius Caesar himself led his troops , and receivedhonorable wounds in the battles.  |p111I  . Letters : Nicolaus of Damascus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 B.C. ) My dear Strabo , I have witnessed an event , the significance of which only you , the dearest of all my friends , will apprehend . For on this day Marcus Antonius , triumvir of Rome , has become Imperator of Egypt  --  a king in fact , though he does not call himself such . He has taken in marriage that Cleopatra who is the Incarnate Isis , Queen of Egypt , and Empress of all the lands of the Nile . I give you news that , I suspect , none of Rome has heard yet , possibly not even that young ruler of the Roman world of whom you have so often written and whom you so admire ; for the marriagewas sudden , and known even to this Eastern world only a few days before the actual event . Oh , my old friend , I would almostrelinquish some part of that wisdom toward which we both have so laboriously striven , if I could but see the look upon your face at this moment ! It must be one of surprise  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teases you ; I can not resist provoking what I hope is a friendly envy in one whose good fortune in the world has provoked the same in me . For you must have known that your letters from Rome have raised that envy in me . How often in Damascus did I wish that I was with you there , in the " center of the world , " as you have called it , conversing with the great men you mention with such frequency and such intimacy . Now I , too , have come into the world ; and by a stroke of good fortune , which I still can not quite believe , I have secured a most remarkable position . I am tutor to the children of Cleopatra , master of the Royal library , and principalof the schools of the Royal household . All of this has happened so quickly that I can hardly believe it , and I still do not fully understand the reasons for the appointment . Perhaps it is because I am nominally a Jew yet a philosopherand no fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the court of King Herod , whom MarcusAntonius has recently legitimatized as King of all Judaea and with whom he wants to live in peace . Could politics touch one so unpolitical as myself ? I hope that I am being too modest ; I would like to think that my reputation as a scholar has had the final weight in the matter . In any event , I was approached by an emissary of the Queen at Alexandria , where I had gone on some business for my father , in the course of which I took the time to make use of the Royal library ; I was approached , and I accepted at once . Aside from the material advantages of the position ( which are considerable ) , the Royal Library is the most remarkable I have ever seen ; and I will have continual access to books that few men have used or even seen before . And now that I am a member of the Royal household , I travel wherever the Queen goes ; thus , I arrived in Antioch three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria . I do not fully understand why the ceremonies were held here , rather than in the Royal palace at Alexandria ; perhaps Antonius does not wish to flout Roman law too openly , even though he seems to have cast his fortunes in the East ( what is the Roman legality of this matter , I wonder , since , it is said , he has not bothered to obtain a legal divorce from his former wife ? ) ; or perhaps he merely wants to make clear to the Egyptians that he does not usurp the authority of their Queen . Perhaps there is no meaning . However that may be , the ceremonies have been held ; and to all the Eastern world , the Queen and Marcus Antonius are man and wife ; and whatever Rome may think , they are the joint rul/tits of this world . Marcus Antonius has announced publicly that Caesarion ( known to be the child of his one-time friend , Julius Caesar ) is heir to the throne of Cleopatra , and that the twins that the Queen has borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , increased the extent of Egypt 's possessions many-fold ; the Queen now has under her authority all of Arabia , including Petra and the Sinai Peninsula ; that part of JordanWhich lies between the Dead Sea and Jericho ; parts of Galilee and Samaria ; the whole of the Phoenician coast ; the richest parts of Lebanon , Syria , and Cilicia ; the whole of the Island of Cyprus , and a part of Crete . Thus I , who was once a Syrian Roman , might now consider myself a Syrian Egyptian ; but I am neither . Like you , my old friend , I am a scholar , who would be a philosopher ; and I am no more Roman or Egyptian than was our Aristotlea Greek , who never lost his love and pride for his native Ionia . I shall emulate that greatest of all men , and remain content to be a Damascene . Yet as you yourself have so often said , the world of affairs is an extraordinarily interesting one ; and perhaps neither of us , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed ourselves from it in our studies . The way to knowledge is a long journey , and the goal is distant ; and one must visit many places along the way , if he is to know that goal when he arrives at it . Though I have seen her at a distance , I have not yet had an audiencewith the Queen by whom I am employed . Marcus Antoniusis everywhere  --  jovial , familiar , and not at all forbidding . He is a little like a child , I think  --  though his hair is graying , and he is getting a bit fat . I think I shall again be happy in Alexandria , as I was during our student days . As I believe I mentioned in my last letter to you , I had seen the Queen only at a distance  --  at the wedding ceremony which united her to Marcus Antonius and the power of Rome , a ceremonywhich only those attached to the Royal household were allowed to attend . The palace at Antioch is not so imposing as that in Alexandria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was crowded to the rear of the long hall , from which vantage I could make out veryp114little , though an ebony dais had been raised , upon which Cleopatraand Antonius stood . All I could see of the Queen was her jeweled gown , which sparkled in the torchlight , and the great disk of gold representing the sun , which was set above her crown of state . She moved in a slow and grave manner , as if she were indeedthe goddess that her title proclaims her to be . It was an extraordinarilyelaborate ceremony ( though described by some of my new friends as really rather simple ) , the significance of which I do not understand ; priests marched about and chanted various incantations in that ancient form of the language which only they can speak ; anointings with various oils were made ; wands were waved . It was all very mystifying and ( I must confess I thought ) rather uncivilized , almost barbaric . And so I went to my first audience with the Queen with an odd feeling , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Circe , neither quite goddess nor quite woman , but something more unnatural than either . My dear Strabo , I can not tell you how fortunately I was surprised , and how happy I was at my surprise . I expected to encountera swarthy and rather hefty woman , such as one sees in the market place ; I met a slender woman of fair skin and soft brown hair , with enormous eyes , who had poise and dignity and an extraordinary charm , who put me at ease at once and bade me sit near her on a couch no less luxurious than her own , as if I were a guest in a simple and friendly household . And we spoke at length upon those ordinary topics which constitute any civilized conversation . She laughs easily and quietly , and seems totally attentive to her audience . Her Greek is impeccable ; her Latin is at least as good as mine ; and she speaks casually to her servants in a dialect I can not understand . She is widely and intelligently read  --  she even shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows my own work upon his philosophy , and that her understanding has been enhanced by that knowledge . I am not , as you know , a vain man ; and even if I were , I believemy vanity would have been overwhelmed by my gratitude and my admiration for this most extraordinary of women . That one so charming could also rule one of the richest lands in the world is almost beyond belief.  |p115I  have been back in Alexandria for three weeks now , and I have begun my duties ; Marcus Antonius and the Queen remain in Antioch , where Antonius is making preparations for his march , later in the year , against the Parthians . My duties are not heavy ; I have as many slaves as I need for the management of the Queen 's library , and the children take up little of my time . The twins  --  Alexander of the Sun and Cleopatra of the Moon  --  are only a few months more than three years old , and therefore not capable of taking any instruction ; but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments at least , in ( , reek and ( at the Queen 's insistence ) even in Latin , so that when they grow older the sounds of the language will not be unfamiliar to their ears . But Ptolemy Caesar  --  called Caesarion by the peopleho is almost twelve years old , is another matter . I believe Iould have guessed that he might be the son of the great Julius Caesar , even had I not known it . He recognizes his destiny , and lie is prepared for it ; he swears that he remembers his father from his mother 's residence in Rome , just before the assassination  --  though he could hardly have been four years old at the time of that event . He is serious , utterly without humor , and oddly intent on whatever he does . It is as if he never had a childhood , and did not want one ; he speaks of the Queen as if she were not his mother at all , but only the powerful sovereign that she is ; and he awaits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impatiently , but with the same certainty that he waits the morning sunrise . He would frighten me a little , I believe , if he were to hold the vast power that his mother now has . But he is a good student , and it is a pleasure to teach him . For those who put stock in such things , it has been an ominous winter  --  almost no rainfall , so that the crops will be sparse this year ; and a series of cyclones has swept across the lands of Syria and Egypt from the east , laying waste whole villages before spending themselves in the sea . And Antonius has marched from Antioch against the Parthians with what is said to be the greatest expeditionary army since the time of the Macedonian , Alexander the Great ( whose blood , it is said , flows in the veins of Cleopatra )  --  more than sixty thousand seasoned veterans , ten thousand troops of horse from Gaul and Spain , and thirty thousandauxiliary forces recruited from the kingdoms of the Eastern provinces to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth ( he has recently become interested in the art of warfare ) , has said that such an army is wasted against the Eastern barbarians ; were he king , he says  --  as if war were truly the game that it seems to him now  --  he would turn the army toward the west where there is more than plunder to be gained . The Queen has returned from Antioch , by way of Damascus , and will remain in Alexandria until Antonius concludes his campaignagainst the Parthians . Knowing that Damascus was my birthplace , she was kind enough to call me into her chambers and give me the news . It is extraordinary how thoughtful and human the great can be . For in Damascus , she had a meeting with King Herod on some business regarding the rents from some balsam fields ; and remembering an earlier conversation with me , she inquiredafter the health of my father , and asked Herod to have conveyed to him greetings from his son and from the Queen . I have not heard from him since those greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is growing old , and is becomingfeeble in his age . I suspect that at such a time one looks back upon one 's life and wonders at its worth , and needs the kindness of some assurance . I1 . Letter : Marcus Antonius to Cleopatra , from Armenia ( November , 36 B.C. ) My dear wife , I now thank my Roman gods and your Egyptianones that I did not succumb to my own desires and to your determination , and allow you to accompany me on this campaign . It has been even more difficult than I anticipated ; and it is clear that what I had hoped would be concluded this fall will now have to wait until spring . The Parthians have proved to be a wily and resourceful foe , and they have made more intelligent use of their terrain than Ip117might have foreseen . The maps made by Crassus and Ventidiustheir campaigns here have proved worse than useless ; treasonsamong some of the provincial legions have harmed our cause ; andis abominable countryside does not furnish sufficient food to keep my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have withdrawn from my siege of Phraaspa , where we could not have endured the cold ; and for twenty-seven days we have made our way across the country , nearly all the way from the Caspian Sea , and now rest in the comparative safety of Armenia , though we are tired , and illness pervades the camp . Yet all in all , the campaign has , I believe , been a successful one , though I fear that many of my weary soldiers would not agree with me . I know the Parthian tricks now ; and we have mapped the territory with sufficient accuracy to serve us next year . I have tent to Rome the news of our victory . But you must understand that , despite the tactical success of the campaign , I am now in most desperate straits . We can not stay in Armenia ; I do not fully trust my host , King Artavasdes , who deserted me at a crucial moment in Parthia  --  though I can not now upbraid him , since we are his guests . Therefore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the army will join me after it has recovered from its exhaustion . To endure the winter , even in Syria , we shall need provisions ; for we are like beggars now . We shall need food , and clothing , and the materials necessary to repair our damaged war machines . We shall also need horses to replenish those lost in battle and to the weather , so that we might continue training for the campaign next spring . And I must have money . My soldiers have not been paid for months , and some are threatening revolt . And we shall need these things quickly . I attach to this letter a detailed list of t hose things that I absolutely require , and a supplementary list of things that may be needed later in the winter . I can not exaggerateour need . We shall winter in the little village of Leuke Kome , just south of Beirut . You may not have heard of it . There is sufficient dockagethere for the ships that you will send . Be careful . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast lines by the time you receive this . But there should be no danger of blockage at Leuke Kome . I trust that this letter will reach you soon , how- ever rough the winter seas are ; we shall not be able to endure for many more weeks without provisions . Outside my tent the snow is falling , so that the plain on which we are encamped is invisible . I can see no other tent ; I can hear no sound . I am cold , and in the silence more aware of my lonelinessthan you can imagine . I long for the warmth of your arms and for the intimacy of your voice . Come to me in Syria with your ships . I must stay there with my troops , else they will scatterbefore spring comes , and our sacrifices will have been for naught ; and yet I can not suffer another month without your presence . Come to me , and we shall make of Beirut another Antioch , or Thebes , or Alexandria . III . Report : Epimachos , High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 36 B.C. ) Revered Queen : No man is more courageous than that Marcus Antonius whom you have honored by your presence and raised at your side to overlook the world . He fights more bravely than prudence should allow , and endures privations and hardships which would destroy the most seasoned common soldier . But he is no general , and the campaign has been a disaster . If what I report to you contradicts what you may have heard from other sources , you must know that I write nevertheless in friendship for your husband , in reverence for you , and in anxiety for Egypt and her future . In the spring we marched from Antioch to Zeugma on the River Euphrates , and thence northward along that river , where food was plentiful , to the watershed between the Euphrates and the River Araxes , and then southward toward the Parthian citadelof Phraaspa . But before Phraaspa , to save time , Marcus Antoniusdivided his army , sending our supply train , with our food and baggage , and our battering rams and siege wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army advanced rapidly to its goal . But while that army advanced in safety , the Parthians descended from the mountain upon the more slowly moving force that we had divided from us . News reached us of the attack , butp119when we arrived it was too late to save anything . The escort was slain , our supplies were burned , our siege wagons and engines of war were all destroyed ; and only a few soldiers remained unharmedbehind hastily thrown up fortifications . We then dispersedthe attacking Parthians , who , having done their damage , prudently withdrew to the mountains that they knew , and wheree dared not follow . That was the " victory " that Marcus Antonius reported to Itrune . We counted eighty Parthian dead . Despite the destruction of all our instruments of siege , all our replacement supplies , our food  --  Marcus Antonius persisted in his siege of the Parthian city of Phraaspa . Even if the city had nut been prepared for us , the task would have been nearly impossible , since we had only the arms that we bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open battle ; when we foraged for food , the detachments were set upon by the Parthian archers who appeared from nowhere to kill , and who disappeared again ; and winter drew on . For two months we persisted ; and at last Antoniusexacted from King Phraates a pledge that we would be allowed to retreat from his country without hindrance . And so in mid-October , hungry and exhausted , we began our return whence we had begun , five months before . For twenty-seven days , in bitter cold , through drifts of snow and in swirling winds , we struggled over mountains and unprotectedplains ; and upon eighteen separate occasions we were attackedby the mounted archers of the perfidious Phraates . They swooped from everywhere  --  upon our rear , our flanks , our fronts ; let fly their arrows before we could prepare ourselves ; and then were gone back into their barbaric darkness , while the poor blind animal that was their victim lumbered on . It was in these awful days of retreat that your Marcus Antoniusshowed himself to be the man that he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take no food other than that taken by his comrades , who were reduced to gnawing roots and foraging for insects in rotting wood ; nor would he wear clothing warmer than they wore themselves . We are in Armenia now , where we can not stay ; the King of this country , nominally our ally but no more trustworthy than our foe , has furnished us with a little food . We leave for Syriap120soon . But I have made an accounting of our losses , and I give them to you . In these five months , we have lost nearly forty thousand men , many to Parthian arrows , but more to the cold and disease ; of these , twenty-two thousand were Antonius 's Roman veterans , the best warriors in the world , it is said ; and these can not be replaced , unless Octavius Caesar consents to replace them  --  and that is not likely . Virtually all the horse is gone . We have no reserveof supplies . We have no clothing , except the rags we wear . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , Revered Queen , if you wish to save even a remnant of this army , you must accede to your husband 's request for supplies . Out of his pride , he may not , I fear , wish you to know how desperate his plight is . IV .

Letter : Cleopatra to Marcus Antonius , from Alexandria ( winter , 35 B.C. ) My dear husband , the Queen has ordered that the needs of your brave army be filled ; and your wife like a trembling girl flies to meet you , as rapidly as the uncertain winter sea will carry her . Indeed , even as you read this letter , she is no doubt at the prow of the ship that leads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Syrian coast where her lover waits , cold in the weather , but warm in the anticipation of her lover 's arms . As a Queen , I rejoice at your success ; as a woman , I bewail the necessity that has kept us apart . And yet during these hurried days since I received your letter , I have concluded ( can I be wrong ? ) that at last woman and Queen may become one . I shall persuade you to return with me to the warmth and comfort of Alexandria , and to leave the completion of your success in Parthia for another day . It will be my pleasure to persuade you as a woman ; it is my duty to persuade you as a Queen . The treasons that you have seen in the East have had their birth in the West . Octavius plots against you still , and libels you to those whose salvation is to love you . I know that he has tried to subvert Herod ; and I am persuaded by all the intelligence that I can gather that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your success in Parthia . I must convinceyou that there are barbarians in Rome as well as in Parthia ; and their use of your loyalty and good nature is more dangerous than any Parthian arrow . In the East there is only plunder ; but in the West there is the world , and such power as only the great can imagine . But even now my mind wanders from what I say . I think of you , the mightiest of men  --  and I am woman again , and care nothing for kingdoms , for wars , for power . I come to you at last , and count the hours as if they were days . VI/1 . Letter : Gaius Cilnius Maecenas to Titus Livius ( 12 B.C. ) How delicately you put things , my dear Livy ; and yet , beneaththat delicacy , how clear are your brutal alternatives ! Were we " deceived " ( and therefore fools ) , or did we " withhold " some information ( and were therefore liars ) ? I shall reply somewhat less delicately than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deceived about the matter of Parthia ; how could we have been deceived ? Even before we got Antonius 's account of the campaign , we knew the truth of it . We lied to the Roman people . I must say that I am a good deal less offended by your questionp123than by what I perceive to lie behind it . You forget that I am an artist myself , and know the necessity of asking what to ordinary people would seem the most insulting and presumptuous things . I low could I take offense at that which I myself would do , withoutthe slightest hesitation , for the sake of my art ? No , it is what I perceive in the tenor of your question that begins to give me offense ; for I think ( I hope I am wrong ) I detect the odor of a moralist . And it seems to me that the moralist is the most useless and contemptible of creatures . He is useless in that he would expendhis energies upon making judgments rather than upon gainingknowledge , for the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptible in that his judgments reflect a vision of himself which in his ignorance and pride he would impose upon the world . I implore you , do not become a moralist ; you will destroy your art and your mind . And it would be a heavy burden for even the deepest friendship to bear . As I have said , we lied ; and if I give the reasons for the lie , I do not explain in order to defend . I explain to enlarge your understanding and your knowledge of the world . After the Parthian debacle , Antonius sent to the Senate a dispatchdescribing his " victory " in the most glowing and general terms ; and demanded , though in absentia , the ceremony of a triumph . We accepted the lie , allowed it currency , and gave him his triumph . Italy had been racked by two generations of civil wars ; the immediatehistory of a strong and proud people was a history of defeat , for none is victor in a civil strife ; after the defeat of Sextus Pompeius , peace seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been simply catastrophic , both to the stability of our government and to the soul of the people . For a people may endure an almost incredible series of the darkest failures without breaking ; but give them respite and some hope for the future , and they may not endure an unexpected denial of that hope . And there were more particular reasons for the lie . The defeat of Sextus Pompeius had been accomplished only shortly before we got the news from Parthia ; the auxiliary legions had been disbandedand settled on the lands promised them ; the prospect that they might be called again would have wholly disrupted all landp124values outside of Rome , and would have proved disastrous to an already precarious economy . Finally , and most obviously , we still had some hope that Antoniusmight be deflected from his Eastern dream of Empire and become once again a Roman . It was a vain hope , but at that time it seemed a reasonable one . To have refused him his triumph  --  to have told your " truth " to all of Rome  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned in honor or in peace . In my account of these events , I have been saying " we " ; but you must understand that for nearly three years after the defeat of Sextus Pompeius , Octavius and Agrippa were only occasionally in Rome ; most of their time was spent in Illyria , securing our borders and subduing the barbarian tribes that theretofore had ranged freely up and down the Dalmatian shore-lands , and had even pillaged villages on the Adriatic coast of Italy itself . During this time I was entrusted with the official seal of Octavius . These decisions were mine , though in every instance , I am proud to say , they were approved by the Emperor , though often after the fact . I remember once he returned to Rome , briefly , to recuperate from a wound received in a battle against one of the Illyrian tribes ; and he said to me , only half-jokingly , I think , that with Agrippa at the head of his army and with me , however unofficially , at the head of his government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relinquish any pretense to either position , and for his own pleasure become the head of my stable of poets . Marcus Antonius . . . . The charges and countercharges that have come down through the years ! But beneath them , the truth was there , though the world may never fully apprehend it . We played no game ; we had no need to . Though many senators in Rome , being of the old Party and somehow irrationally reversing allegiances and seeing Antonius as the only hope of recapturing the past , we knew to be against us and for Antonius , yet the people were for us ; we had the army ; and we had sufficient senatorialpower to carry at least the most important of our edicts . We could have endured Marcus Antonius in the East as an independentsatrap or Imperator or whatever he chose to call himself , so long as he remained a Roman , even a plundering Roman ; we could have endured him in Rome , even with hisp125recklessness and ambition . But it was being forced upon us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was sick from that dream . We gave him his triumph ; it strengthened his senatorial support , but it did not draw him back to Rome . We offered him the consulship ; he refused it , and did not return to Rome . And in what was really a last desperate effort to avert what we knew was coming , we returned to him the seventy ships of his fleet that had helped us defeat Sextus Pompeius , and we sent two thousand troops to augment his depleted Roman legions . And Octavia sailed with the fleet and soldiers to Athens , in the hope that Antoniusmight be dissuaded from his awful ambition and return to his duty as husband , Roman , and triumvir . He accepted the ships ; he enlisted the troops ; and he refused to see Octavia , nor even gave her dwelling in Athens , but sent her forthwith back to Rome . And as if to leave no doubt in the minds of any of his contempt , he staged a triumph in Alexandria  --  in Alexandria  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to Cleopatra , a foreign monarch , who sat above even Antonius himself and upon a golden throne . It is said that a most barbaric ceremony followed the triumph  --  Antonius robed himself as Osiris , and sat beside Cleopatra , who was gowned as Isis , that most peculiar goddess . He proclaimed his mistress to be Queen of Kings , and proclaimed that her Caesarion was joint monarch over Egypt and Cyprus . He even had struck coins on one side of which was a likeness of himself and on the other a likeness of Cleopatra . As if it were an afterthought , he had sent to Octavia letters of divorce , and had her evicted without ceremony or warning from his Roman dwelling . We could not then evade what must ensue . Octavius returned from Illyria , and we began to prepare for whatever madness might come from the East . IX . Senatorial Proceedings , Rome ( 33 B.C. ) On this day Marcus Agrippa , Consular and Admiral of the Roman Fleet , Aedile of the Roman Senate , does declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the glory of Rome , the following : I.

X. Petition : the Centurion Quintus Appius to Munatius Plancus , Commander of the Asian Legions of the Imperator Marcus Antonius , from Ephesus ( 32 B.C. ) I , Appius , son of Lucius Appius , am of the Cornelian tribe and of Campanian origin . My father was a farmer , who left me a few acres of land near Velletri , which from the age of eighteen to twenty-three I tilled for a humble livelihood . My cottage is there yet , overseen by the wife I married in my youth , who , though a freedwoman , is chaste and faithful ; and the land is tended by the three of my sons who remain alive . Two sons I lost  --  one top127disease , and the eldest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these many years ago . For the sake of Italy and my posterity , I became a soldier in the twenty-third year of my life , in the consulship of Tullius Ciceroand Gaius Antonius , who was uncle to the Marcus Antonius who is now my master . For two years I was a common soldier in that army under Gaius Antonius which defeated in honorable battle the conspirator Catiline ; in my third year as a soldier I was with Julius Caesar in his first Spanish campaign , and though I was a young man , in reward for my bravery in battle , Julius Caesarmade me a lesser centurion of the IV Macedonian legion . I have been a soldier for thirty years ; I have fought in eighteen campaigns , in fourteen of which I was centurion and in one of which I was acting military tribune ; I have fought under the command of six duly elected consuls of the Senate ; I have served in Spain , Gaul , Africa , Greece , Egypt , Macedonia , Britain , and Germany ; I have marched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for saving the life of a fellow soldier ; and I have twenty times been decorated for bravery in battle . The oath I took as a young soldier bound me to the authority of the magistrates , the consuls , and the Senate for the defense of my country . To that oath I have been faithful , and have served Rome with that honor of which I am capable . I am now in my fifty-third year , and I ask release from military service , so that I may return to Velletri and spend my remaining years in privacy and peace . I know that , in the law , you may refuse this release , despite my age and service , since I volunteered freely for another campaign ; and I know , too , that what I shall now say may put me in jeopardy . If it is to do so , I shall accept my fate . When I was detached from the army of Marcus Agrippa and sent to Athens and thence to Alexandria and finally here to Ephesus and the army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier 's lot , and I have grown accustomed to it . I had fought the Parthians before , and had no fear of them . But the events of the past few weeks have put me into a deep doubt ; and I must turn to you , with whom I fought in Gaul under Julius Caesar , and whose honorable behavior toward me gives me somep128hope that you may hear me before you judge me too harshly . It is clear that we shall not fight the Parthians , or the Medians , or anyone else to the East . And yet we arm , and we train , and we build the engines of war . I have given my oath to the consuls and the Senate of the Roman people ; it is an oath that I have not broken . And yet where is the Senate now ? And where is my oath to find its fulfillment ? We know that three hundred senators and the two consuls of the year have quit Rome , and are now here in Ephesus , where the Imperator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have remained in Rome ; and new consuls in Rome have replaced those who have come here . To whom do I owe my oath ? Where is the Roman people , whom the Senate must represent ? I do not hate Octavius Caesar , though I would fight him , were that my duty ; I do not love Marcus Antonius , though I would die for him were that my duty . It is not the place of the soldier to think of politics , and it is not the business of the soldier to hate or love . It is his duty to fulfill his oath . A Roman , I have fought against Romans before , though I have done so with sorrow . But I have not fought against Romans under the banner of a foreign queen , and I have not marched against my nation and my countrymen as if they were the painted barbarians of a foreign province , to be plundered and subdued . I am an old man , and tired , and I ask release to return quietly to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not move against your authority . If it is your decision that I may not be released , I shall acquit myself with that honor in which I trust I have lived . XI . Letter : Munatius Plancus , Commander of the Asian Legions , to Octavius Caesar , from Ephesus ( 32 B.C. ) Though we have differed , I have not been your enemy so much as I have been friend to Marcus Antonius , whom I have known since those days when we were both the trusted generals of your late and divine father , Julius Caesar . Through all thep129years , I have tried to be loyal to Rome , and yet be loyal to the man whom I have had for friend . It is no longer possible for me to remain loyal to both . As if in an enchantment , Marcus Antonius follows blindly wherever Cleopatra will lead ; and she will lead where her ambition takes her , and that is simply the conquest of the world , the succession of her progeny in kingship over that world , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been unable to dissuade Marcus Antonius from this disastrous course . Even now , troops from all the Asian provinces gather at Ephesus to join the sad Roman legions which Antonius will hurl against Rome ; the doors of Cleopatra 's treasury are open to prosecute the war against Italy ; and she will not leave Marcus Antonius 's side , but goads him bitterly toward your destruction and the fulfillment of her ambition . It is said that henceforward she will march at his side and command , even in battle . Not only myself , but all of his friends have urged him to send Cleopatra back to Alexandria , where her presence might not provoke the hatred of the Roman troops , but he will not , or can not , move . Thus I have been forced to choose between a waning friendshipfor a man and a steady love for my country . I return to Italy , and I renounce the Eastern adventure . And I will not be alone . I have spent my life with the Roman soldier , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banner of a foreign queen , and those who in their confusion will fight , will do so with sorrow and reluctance , so that their strength and soldierly determination will be lessened . I come to you in friendship , and I offer you my services ; if you can not accept the former , perhaps you will find use for the latter . Xll . The Memoirs of Marcus Agrippa : Fragments ( 13 B.C. ) I come now to the account of those events which led to the battle of Actium and at last to the peace of which Rome had lohg despaired . Marcus Antonius and the Queen Cleopatra gathered their strength in the East , and moved their armies from Ephesus to the Island of Samos , and thence to Athens , where they poised in threat to Italy and peace . In the second consulship of Caesar Au/gustus , I was aedile of Rome ; and when the year of those duties was over , we turned ourselves to the task of rebuilding the armies of Italy that would repel the threat of Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many months . We returned to discover the Senate subverted by the friends of Antonius who were the enemies of the Roman people ; we opposedthose enemies , and when it became clear to them that they would not prevail in their designs against the order of Italy , the two consuls of the year , and behind them three hundred senators without faith or love for their homeland , quit Rome and made their way out of Italy to join Antonius ; and went without hindranceor threat from Caesar Augustus , who saw them depart with sorrow , but without anger . And in the East , loyal Roman troops , at first by tens and then by hundreds , refusing the yoke of a foreign queen , made their way to Italy ; and from them we knew that there would be no escapefrom war ; and knew also that that war would come soon , for Antonius was weakening from the desertions , and would , if he delayed too long , be wholly dependent upon the caprice and inexperience of his barbarian legions and their Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his second consulship , Caesar Augustus , with the consent of the Senate and the Roman people , did declare that a state of war existed between the Roman people and Cleopatra , Queen of Egypt ; and led by Caesar Augustus , the Senate in solemn march took themselves to the Campus Martius , and at the Temple of Bellona , the herald read the words of war , and the priests made sacrifice of a white heifer to the goddess , and prayed that the army of Rome be made safe in all the battles that were to come . After the defeat of Sextus Pompeius , Augustus had vowed to the Roman people that the civil wars were ended , and that not again would the soil of Italy suffer to receive the blood of her sons . Throughout the winter we trained our soldiers on land , repairedand augmented our fleet , exercising upon the sea when weather allowed us ; and in the spring , learning that Marcus Antoniushad gathered his fleet and his army at the seaward opening of the Bay of Corinth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Eastern coast of Italy , we moved against him , to save Italy from the wounds of war.  |p131Against  us was arrayed the might of the Eastern world  --  one hundred thousand troops , of which thirty thousand were Roman , and five hundred ships of war , deployed along the coastal lands of Greece ; and eighty thousand reserves of troops that remained in Egypt and Syria . Against this force we brought fifty thousand Roman soldiers , a number of which were veterans of the sea campaignagainst Pompeius , two hundred fifty ships of war , the latter under my command , and one hundred fifty vessels of supply . The coast of Greece boasts few harbors that may be defended , and thus we had no trouble landing the troops that would fight Antonius on the land ; and the ships under my command blockadedthe sea routes of supply from Syria and Egypt , so that the forces of Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius would have to depend upon the land that they had invaded for food and supplies . Loath to take Roman lives , throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blockade rather than warfare ; and in the summer , we moved in strength to the Bay of Actium , where the largest enemy force was concentrated , hoping to lure there those who would prevent our pretended invasion , in which effort we succeeded . For Antonius and Cleopatra sailed in full complement to rescue the ships and men we did not intend to attack , and we fell hack before the advance of their ships , and let them enter into the bay , whence we knew eventually they would have to emerge . We would force them to do battle upon sea , though their strength was upon the land . The mouth of the Bay of Actium is less than one half a mile in width , though the bay itself widens considerably within , so that the enemy ships had sufficient room to harbor ; and while they rested inside with the soldiers encamped ashore , Caesar Augustus sent troops of infantry and cavalry around them , and fortified the encirclement , so that they would have retreated overland at great cost . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East suffered from hunger and disease , and could not muster the strength for a retreat by land . They would fight by sea . ' The ships of war that we had returned to Antonius after the defeat of Sextus Pompeius were the largest of the fleet , and I had learned that those which Antonius had built to war against us were even larger , some carrying as many as ten banks of oars and girded by bands of iron against ramming ; such ships are nearlyp132invincible against smaller ships in direct combat , when there is no room for maneuvering . Therefore I had much earlier resolved to rely upon a preponderance of lighter and more maneuverable craft , with as few as two and as many as six banks of oars , and none larger ; and resolved to be so patient as to lure the Eastern fleets into the open sea . For at Naulochus , against Pompeius , we had had to engage the enemy ships at shore , where swiftness meant nothing . We waited ; and on the first day of September we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw those burned for which there were no rowers ; and we made ready for what must ensue on the morrow . The morning came bright and clear ; the harbor and the sea beyondwere smooth like a table of translucent stone . The Eastern fleet raised sail , as if hoping to pursue us when a wind came up ; the oarsmen dipped their oars ; and the fleet , like a solid wall , moved slowly across the water . Antonius himself commanded the starboard squadron of the three groups , which were so close that often the opposing oars clashed together , and the fleet of Cleopatrafollowed behind the center squadron at some distance . My own squadron opposed that of Antonius ; and those ships commanded by Caesar Augustus were at the port . We were beyond the mouth of the bay , and spread thinly out in a curving line , so that we had no ships behind us . As the enemy advanced toward us , we did not move ; he paused at the mouth , and no oar was dipped for several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move ; we waited . And at last , out of impatience or an excess of boldness , the commander of the port squadron moved forward ; Caesar Augustusmade as if to withdraw from danger ; the squadron pursued him without thought , and the rest of the Eastern fleet followed . Our center squadron fell back , we lengthened our line , and the enemy fleet rode in like fish into a net , and we surrounded them . Until nearly dusk the battle raged , though the issue was at no time in serious doubt . We had not raised sail , and we could move swiftly about the heavier ships ; and having hoisted sail , the enemy'sdecks did not afford room forslingers and archers to work effectively ; and the sails offered easy targets for the fireballs that we catapulted . Our own decks were clear so that when we grap/pled a ship , our soldiers in superior numbers could board the enemy and overcome him with some ease . He would attempt to form a wedge so that he could break our line ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had to fight singly ; he tried to form again , and we broke him again , so that at last each ship fought for its own survival , as best it could . And the sea blazed with ships that we fired , and we heard above the roar of the flames the screams of men who burned with their ships , and the sea darkened with blood and was awash with bodies that had thrown off armor and struggled weakly to escape the fire and the sword and the javelin and the arrow . Though they opposed us , they were Roman soldiers ; and we were sickenedat the waste . During all the fighting , the ships of Cleopatra had hung back in the harbor ; and when at last a breeze sprang up , she had her sails set into the wind , and swung around the ships that were locked in battle and made toward the open sea where we could not follow . It was one of those curious moments in the confusion of warfarewith which all soldiers are familiar . The vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close together that we could look into each other 's eyes and could even shout to be heard above the furor ; not thirty yards away , where it had been pursued and then left , was the ship of Marcus Antonius . I believe that all three of us saw the purple sail of Cleopatra 's departingflagship at the same time . None of us moved ; Antonius stood at the prow of his ship as if he were a carven figurehead , looking after his departing Queen . And then he turned to us , though whether he recognized either of us I do not know . His face was without expression , as if it were that of a corpse . Then his arm lifted stiffly , and dropped ; and the sails were thrust into the wind , and the great ship turned slowly and gathered speed , and Marcus Antonius followed after his Queen . We watched the pitiful remains of his own ships that escaped the slaughter , and we did not attempt to pursue . I did not see Marcus Antonius again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cared for our wounded enemies , who were also our brothers , and we burned those ships that remained of the Antonian force ; andp134Caesar Augustus said that no Roman soldier who had been our enemy should suffer for his bravery , but should be returned to honor and the safety of Rome . We knew that we had won the world ; but there were no songs of victory that night , nor joy among any of us . Late into the night the only sound that could be heard was the lap and hiss of water against the burning hulls and the low moans of the wounded ; a glow of burning hung over the harbor , and Caesar Augustus , his face stark and reddened in that glow , stood at the prow of his ship and looked upon the sea that held the bodies of those brave men , both comrade and foe , as if there were no differencebetween them .

Statement : Hirtia to Her Son , Quintus , Velletri ( 2 B.C. ) I am Hirtia . My mother , Crispia , was once a slave in the householdof Atia , wife to Gaius Octavius the Elder , niece to Julius Caesar the God , and mother to that Octavius whom the world knows now as Augustus . I can not write , so I speak these words to my son Quintus , who manages the estates of Atius Sabinus in Velletri . He writes these words so that our posterity may know of the time before them , and of the part their ancestors had in that time . I am in my seventy-second year , and the end of my life comes toward me ; I wish to say these words before the gods close my eyes forever . Three days ago my son took me into Rome , so that before my eyes dimmed beyond sight I might look again upon the city that I remembered from my youth ; and there an event befell me which raised memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never return to it . After more than fifty years , I saw again that one who is now master of the world and who has more titles than my poor mind can remember . But once I called him " my Tavius , " and held him in my arms as if he were my own . I shall speak later of that ; now I must say my memories of an earlier time . My mother was born a slave in the Julian household . She wasp140given to Atia first as a playmate , and then as a servant . But even when she was young , she was granted her freedom for faithful service , so that she might , in the law , marry the freedman Hirtius , who became my father . My father was overseer of all the olive groves on the Octavian estate at Velletri ; and it was in a cottage near the villa , on the hill above the groves , that I was born , and where I lived in the kindness of that household for the first nineteen years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the gods are willing , I shall die in that cottage in the contentmentof my childhood . My mistress and her husband did not stay often at the villa ; they lived in Rome , for Gaius Octavius the Elder was a man of importance in the government of those days . When I was ten years old , my mother informed me that Atia had given birth to a son ; and because he was sickly , she decided that he would spend his infancy in the country air , away from the stench and smoke of the city . My mother had recently given birth to a stillborn child , and could nurse her mistress 's son . And as my mother took a child to her breast as if it were her own , so did my young heart , which was beginning to stir toward the dream of motherhood . As young as I was , I washed his body ; swaddled him ; held his tiny hand when he took his first steps ; saw him grow . In my childhood game of motherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then called Tavius was five years old , his father returned from a long stay in the land of Macedonia and visited with his family for a few days ; he planned to move southwardto another of his residences in Nola , where we were to join him for the winter season . But he became suddenly ill , and died before we could take the journey ; and my Tavius lost the father whom he had never known . I held him in my arms to comfort him . I remember that his little body quivered ; he did not cry . For four more years he remained in our care , though a teacher was sent from Rome to attend him ; and occasionally his mother visited . When I was in my nineteenth year , my mother died ; and my mistress Atia  --  who after her time of mourning and in her duty had married again  --  decided that her son must return to Rome so that he might begin to prepare himself for manhood . And in her kindness and for the safety of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to keep me from ever living in want ; and for the well-being of my person , she gave me in marriage to a freedman of her family , who had a modest but safe prosperity in a flock of sheep that grazed in the mountain countrynear Mutina , north of Rome . Thus I went from my youth and became a woman , and in the way of things had to say good-by to the child I had pretended was mine . The days of play were over for me ; yet it was I who wept when I had to take leave of Tavius . As if I were the child who needed comfort , he embraced me , and told me he would not forget me . We vowed that we would see each other again ; we did not believe that we would . And so the child that had been nIy Tavius went his way to become the ruler of the world , and I found the happiness and purpose for which the gods had destined me . How might an ignorant old woman understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a toddling child , as a boy who ran and shouted with his playmates ? Now everywhere outside of Rome , in the villages and towns of the countryside , he is a god ; there is a temple in his name in my own town of Mutina , and I have heard that there are others elsewhere . His image is on the hearths of the country folk throughout the land . I do not know the ways of the world or of the gods ; I rememhera child who was almost my own , though not born of my body ; and I must say what I remember . He was a child with hair paler than the autumn grain ; a fair skin that would not take the sun . At times he was quick and gay ; at other times quiet and withdrawn . He could be made quickly angry , and as easily removed from that anger . Though I loved him , he was a child like any other . It must be that even then the gods had given him the greatness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I swear he did not know it . His playmates were his equals , even the children of the lowest slaves ; he gave as he received in his tasks or his play . Yes , the , gods must have touched him , and yet in their wisdom preventedhim from knowing ; for I heard in later years that there were many portents at his birth . It is said that his mother dreamed that a god in the form of a serpent entered her , and that she conceived ; that his father dreamed that the sun rose from thep142loins of his wife ; and that miracles beyond understanding took place all over Italy at the moment of his birth . I say only what I have heard , and speak of the memories of those days . And now I must tell of that meeting which raised these thoughts in my head . My son Quintus wanted me to see the great Forum where he often went to take care of business matters for his employer ; and so he aroused me at the first hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they were crowded . We had seen the new Senate House , and were walking up the Via Sacra toward the Temple of Julius Caesar , which was white as mountain snow in the morning sunlight . I remembered that once when I was a child I had seen this man who has become a god ; and I wondered at the greatness of that world of which I had been a part . We paused for a moment to rest beside the temple . In my age I tire easily . And as we rested , I saw walking up the street toward us a group of men whom I knew to he senators ; they wore the togas with the purple stripes . In their midst was a slight figure , bowed as I am bowed , wearing a broad-brimmed hat and with a staff in one hand . The others seemed to be directing their words toward him . My eyes are weak ; I could not make out his features ; but some power of knowledge came upon me , and I said to Quintus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked : " It is who , Mother ? " " It is he , " I said , and my voice trembled . " It is that master of whom I have spoken , who once was in my care . " Quintus looked at him again , and took my arm , and we went closer to the street so that we could watch his passing . Other citizenshad noticed his approach , and we crowded among them . I did not intend to speak ; but as he passed , those memories of my childhood came up within me , and the word was spoken . " Tavius , " I said . The word was hardly more than a whisper , but it was said as he passed me ; and the one whom I had not intended to address paused and looked at me as if he were puzzled . Then he gestured to the men around him to remain where they were , and he came up to me . " Did you speak , old mother ? " he asked  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " You said a name by which I was known as a child . " " I am Hirtia , " I said . " My mother was your foster nurse when you were a child in Velletri . Perhaps you do not remember . " " Hirtia , " he said , and he smiled . He came a step nearer , and looked at me ; his face was lined and his cheeks sunken , but I could see that boy I had known . " Hirtia , " he said again , and touched my hand . " I remember . How many years . . . " More than fifty , " I said . Some of his friends approached him ; he waved them away . " Fifty , " he said . " Have they been kind to you ? " " I have raised five children , of whom three live and prosper . My husband was a good man , and we lived in comfort . The gods have taken my husband , and now I am content that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . " Among your children , " he said , " were there daughters ? " I thought it a strange question . I said : " I was blessed only with sons . " " And they have honored you ? " " They have honored me , " I said . " Then your life has been a good one , " he said . " Perhaps it has been better than you know . " " I am content to go when the gods call me , " I said . He nodded , and a somberness came upon his face . He said with a bitterness I could not understand : " Then you are more fortunatethan I , my sister . " " But you  --  " I said , "  --  you are not like other men . In the countryside your image protects the hearth . And at the crossroads , and in the temples . Are you not happy in the honor of the world ? " He looked at me for a moment , and did not answer . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is your son , " he said . " He has your features . " " It is Quintus , " I said . " He is manager of all the estates of Atius Sabinus at Velletri . Since I was widowed , I have been livingwith Quintus and his family there . They are good people . " He looked at Quintus for a long time without speaking . " I did not have a son , " he said . " I had only a daughter , and Rome . "  |p144I  said , " All the people are your children . " He smiled . " I think now I would have preferred to have had three sons , and to have lived in their honor . " I did not know what to say ; I did not speak . " Sir , " my son said ; his voice was unsteady . " We are humble people . Our lives are what they have been . I have heard that today you speak to the Senate , and thus give to the world your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing . " " Is it Quintus ? " he said . My son nodded . He said : " Quintus , today in my wisdom , I must counsel  --  I must order the Senate to take from me that which I have loved most in this life . " For a moment his eyes blazed , and then his face softened , and he said : " I have given to Rome a freedom that only I can not enjoy . " " You have not found happiness , " I said , " though you have given it . " " It is the way my life has been , " he said . " I hope that you become happy , " I said . " I thank you , my sister , " he said . " There is nothing that I can do for you ? " " I am content , " I said . " My sons are content . " He nodded . " I must perform this duty now , " he said ; but for a long while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did see each other again , as we promised long ago . " " Yes , Master , " I said . He smiled . " Once you called me Tavius . " " Tavius , " I said . " Good-by , Hirtia , " he said . " This time , perhaps we shall  --  " " We shall not meet again , " I said . " I go to Velletri , and I shall not return to Rome . " He nodded , and he put his lips to my cheek , and he turned away . He walked slowly down the Via Sacra to join those who waited for him . These words I have spoken to my son , Quintus , on the third day before the Ides of September . I have spoken them for my sons and for their children , now and to come , so that for as long as this family endures it might know something of its place in the world that was Rome , in the days that are gone.  | 11 . The Journal of Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks , gray and somber in the brillianceof the afternoon sun , descend in a huge profusion toward the sea . This rock , like all the rock on this island of Pandateria , is volcanic in origin , rather porous and light in weight , upon which one must walk with some caution , lest one 's feet he slashed by hidden sharpnesses . There are others on this island , but I am not allowed to see them . Unaccompanied and unwatched , I am permitted to walk a distance of one hundred yards to the sea , as far as the thin strip of black-sand beach ; and to walk a like distance in any direction from this small stone hut that has been my abode for five years . I know the body of this barren earth more intimatelythan I have known the contours of any other , even that of my native Rome , upon which I lavished an intimacy of almost forty years . It is likely that I shall never know another place . On clear days , when the sun or the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I look to the east ; and I think that I can sometimes see the mainland of Italy , perhaps even the city of Naples that nestles in the safety of her gentle bay ; but I can not be sure . It may be only a dark cloud that upon occasion smudges the horizon . It does not matter . Cloud or land , I shall not approach closer to it than I am now . Below me , in the kitchen , my mother shouts at the one servant we are allowed . I hear the banging of pots and pans , and the shouting again ; it is a futile repetition of every afternoon of these years . Our servant is mute ; and though not deaf , it is unlikely that she even understands our Latin tongue . Yet indefatigably my mother shouts at her , in the unflagging optimism that her displeasurewill be felt and will somehow matter . My mother , Scribonia , is a remarkable woman ; she is nearly seventy-five , yet she has the energy and the will of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order a world that has never pleased her , and berating it for not arranging itself according to some principle that'has evaded them both . She came with me here to Pandateria , not , I am sure , out of any maternal regard , but out of a desperate pursuit of a condition that would confirm once again her displeasurewith existence . And I allowed her to accompany me out of what I believe was an appropriate indifference.  |p146I  scarcely know my mother . I saw her upon few occasions when I was a child , even less frequently when I was a girl , and we met only at more or less formal social gatherings when I was a woman . I was never fond of her ; and it gives me now some assuranceto know , after these five years of enforced intimacy , that my feeling for her has not changed . I am Julia , daughter of Octavius Caesar , the August ; and I write these words in the forty-third year of my life . I write them for a purpose of which the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have approved ; I write them for myself and my own perusal . Even if I wished it otherwise , it is unlikelythat any eyes save my own shall see them . But I do not wish it otherwise . I would not explain myself to the world , and I would not have the world understand me ; I have become indifferent to us both . For however long I may live in this body , which I have served with much care and art for so many years , that part of my life which matters is over ; thus I may view it with the detached interest of the scholar that Athenodorus once said I might have become , had I been born a man and not the daughter of an Emperor and god.  --  Yet how strong is the force of old habit ! For even now , as I write these first words in this journal , and as I know that they are written to be read only by that strangest of all readers , myself , I find myself pausing in deliberation as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the appropriate argument itself , the constitution of the argument , the effective arrangement of its parts , and even the style in which those parts are to be delivered . It is myself whom I would persuade to truth by the force of my discourse , and myself whom I would dissuade . It is a foolishness , yet I believe not a harmful one . It occupies my day at least as fully as does the counting of the waves that break over the sand upon the rocky coast of this island where I must remain . Yes : it is likely that my life is over , though I believe I did not fully apprehend the extent to which I knew the truth of that until yesterday , when I was allowed to receive for the first time in nearly two years a letter from Rome . My sons Gaius and Luciusare dead , the former of a wound received in Armenia and the latter of an illness whose nature no one knows on his way to Spain , in the city of Marseilles . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in a removed way I judged to have resulted from the shock of the news ; and I waited for the grief hich I imagined would ensue . But no grief came ; and I began to look upon my life , and to remember the moments that had spaced it out , as if I were not concerned . And I knew that it was over . I'o care not for one 's self is of little moment , but to care not for those whom one has loved is another matter . All has become the object of an indifferent curiosity , and nothing is of consequence . Perhaps I write these words and employ the devices that I have learned so that I may discover whether I may rouse myself from this great indifference into which I have descended . I doubt that I shall be able to do so , any more than I should be able to push these massive rocks down the slope into the dark concern of the sea . I am indifferent even to my doubt . I am Julia , daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born on the third day of September in the year of the consulshipof Lucius Marcius and Gaius Sabinus , in the city of Rome . My mother was that Scribonia whose brother was fatherin-lawto Sextus Pompeius , the pirate whom my father destroyed for the safety of Rome two years after my birth . . . . That is a beginning of which even Athenodorus , my poor Athenodorus , would have approved . III . Letter : Lucius Varius Rufus toPublius Vergilius Maro , from Rome ( 39 B.C. ) My dear Vergil , I trust that your illness does not progress , and that the warmth of the Neapolitan sun has indeed bettered the state of your health . Your friends send their best wishes , and have charged me to assure you that our well-being depends upon your own ; if you are well , so are we . Your friends also have charged me to convey to you our regrets that you could not attend the banquet at the home of Claudius Nero last night , a celebration from whose effects I am just this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it may beguile you from your discomfort if I give you some account of it . Do you know Claudius Nero , your would-be host ? He speaks of you with some familiarity , so I suspect that you have at least met him . If you do know him , you may remember that only twop148years ago he was in exile in Sicily for having opposed our OctaviusCaesar at Perusia ; now he has apparently renounced politics , and he and Octavius seem to be the best of friends . He is quite old , and his wife , Livia , seems more nearly his daughter than his spouse  --  a fortunate circumstance , as you shall shortly understand . It turned out to be a literary evening , though I doubt that Claudiusplanned it that way . He is a good fellow , but he has little learning . It soon became clear that Octavius was really behind it all , and that Claudius was , as it were , the pseudo-host . The occasion was designed to honor our friend Pollio , who will at last give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that learning may flourish even among the common people . It was a mixed gathering , but , as it turned out , a rather fortunateone . Most were our friends  --  Pollio , Octavius and ( alas ! ) Scribonia , Maecenas , Agrippa , myself , Aemilius Macer ; your " admirer " Mevius , who no doubt wangled the invitation from Claudius , who knew no better than to invite him ; one whom none of us knew , an odd little Pontene from Amasia called Strabo , a sort of philosopher , I believe ; for embellishment , several ladies of quality , whose names I can not recall ; and to my surprise ( and I suspectto your pleasure ) that rather blunt but appealing young man whose work you have been kind enough to admire , your Horace . I believe that Maecenas was responsible for his invitation , despite the rudeness he suffered at Horace 's hands several months ago . I must say that Octavius was in extraordinary good spirits , almostloquacious , despite the usual long face that Scribonia wore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps the rather severe months there have made him hungry for civilized company ; moreover , it seems now that the difficulties with both Marcus Antonius and Sextus Pompeius are in abeyance , if not finallysettled . Or perhaps his gaiety had its source in the presence of Claudius 's wife , Livia , to whom he seems to have taken a strong fancy . In any event , Octavius insisted upon playing the part of the wine-master , and mixed the wine much more strongly than he usually does , with nearly equal parts of water , so that even before the first course arrived most of us were a little tipsy . He insisted that Pollio , rather than himself , be placed at the position of honorp149beside Claudius ; while he chose to recline at the inferior position it the table , with Livia beside him . I must say that Octavius and Claudius were exceedingly civilizedtoward each other , given the circumstances ; one would almostthink that they had reached an understanding . Scribonia sat at the other table , gossiping with the ladies and glowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why she should glower . She dislikes the marriage as much as Octavius does , and there is no secret about the fact that a divorce will be effected as soon as Octavius 's child is born . . . . What games they must play , those who have power in the world ! And how ludicrous must they seem to the Muses ! It must be that those who are nearestto the gods are most at their mercy . We are most fortunate , my dear Vergil , that we need not marry to ensure our posterity , but can make the children of our souls march beautifully into the future , where they will not change or die . Claudius serves a good table , I must say  --  a very decent Campanian wine before the meal , and a good Falernian afterwards . The meal was neither ostentatiously elaborate nor affectedlysimple : oysters , eggs , and tiny onions to begin ; roast kid , broiled chicken , and grilled bream ; and a variety of fresh fruits . After the meal , Octavius proposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their separate functions ; and argued briefly with himself as to whether we should drink individual toasts to the ancient three or to the more recent nine ; and finally , after pretending a great struggle , decided upon the latter . " But , " he said , and glanced , smiling , at Claudius , " we must honor the Muses to this extent ; we must not allow them to be soiled by any mention of politics . It is a subject that might embarrassus all . " There was general , if nervous , laughter ; and I suddenly realized how many enemies , past and potential , were in the room . Claudius , whom Octavius had exiled from Italy less than two years before ; Pollio himself , our guest of honor , who was an old friend of Marcus Antonius ; our young Horace , who only three years ago had fought on the side of the traitor Brutus ; and Mevius , poor Mevius , whose envy ran so deep that no man might be spared from the treachery of his flattery , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began . With an apologeticp150bow to Octavius , he chose to extol the ancient Muse of Memory , Mneme ; and likening all mankind to a single body , he went on to compare the collective experience of mankind to the mind of that body ; and thence rather neatly ( though obviously ) he spoke of the library which he was establishing in Rome as if it were the most important quality of the mind , memory ; and concluded that the Muse of Memory presided over all the others in a beneficent reign . Mevius gave a tremulous sigh and said to someone in a loud whisper : " Beautiful . Oh , how beautiful ! " Horace glanced at him , and raised a dubious eyebrow . Agrippa addressed himself to Clio , the Muse of History ; Meviuswhispered loudly something about manliness and bravery ; and Horace glowered at Mevius . Upon my turn , I spoke of Calliope  --  rather badly , I fear , since I could not allude to my own work upon the slain Julius Caesar , even though it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was all rather dull , I fear , though Octavius , reclining with Livia seated beside him in the torchlight , seemed pleased ; it was his animation and gaiety that made possible what otherwise would have been impossible . He assigned to Mevius ( rather obviously , I thought , though Mevius was too full of himself to notice ) that Thalia who is the Muse of Comedy ; and Mevius , delighted to be singled out , launched into a long , farcical account ( stolen , I believe , from Antiphanesof Athens ) about the upstarts of old Athens  --  slaves , freedmen , and tradespeople who presumed to set themselves upon a level with their social betters ; who wangled invitations to the homes of the great , and gorged themselves at their tables , abusing the kindness and generosity of their noble hosts ; and how Thalia , the goddess of the comic spirit , to punish such interlopers , called down upon them certain afflictions , so that their class might be distinguished , and so that the nobility might be protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave thatches of hair like the hay in which they were born , and afflicted with the manners of the stable . And so on , and so on . It became quickly clear that Mevius was attacking your young friend Horace , though for what reason none was quite sure . And no one knew precisely how to behave ; we looked at Octavius ,  |p151but  his face was impassive ; we looked at Maecenas , who seemed unconcerned . None would look at Horace , except myself , who was seated next to him . His face was pale in the flickering light . Mevius finished and sat back , satisfied that he had flattered a patron and destroyed a possible rival . There was a murmur . Octaviusthanked him , and said : " Now who shall speak for that Erato who is the Muse of Po-etry ? " And Mevius , raised by what he thought was his success , said : " Oh , Maecenas , of course ; for he has courted the Muse and won her . It must be Maecenas . " Maecenas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " These last months , she has wandered from my gardens . . . . Perhaps my young friend Horace will speak for her . " Octavius laughed , and turned toward Horace with perfect civility . " I have met our guest only this evening , but I will presumeupon that slight acquaintance . Will you speak , Horace ? " " I will speak , " Horace said ; but for a long time he was silent . Without waiting for a servant , he poured himself a measure of unmixed wine , and drank it at once . And he spoke . I give you his words as I remember them . " You all know the story of the Greek Orpheus of whom our absent Vergil has written so beautifully  --  son of Apollo and the Muse Calliope , whom the god honored by the presence of his manhood , and inheritor of the golden lyre which sent forth light into the world , making even the stones and trees glimmer in a beauty not apprehended before by man . And you know of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity and grace that Eurydice thought herself to be part of the singer 's own soul and came to him in marriage , at which Hymen wept , as if at a fate no one could imagine . And you know , too , how Eurydice at last , wandering foolishly beyond the precincts of her husband 's magic , was touched by a serpent that came out of the bowels of the earth , and dragged from the light of life into the darkness of the underground  --  where Orpheus in his despair followed , havingbound his eyes against a dark that no man can imagine . And there he sang so beautifully and gave such light to the darkness , that the very ghosts shed tears , the wheel upon which Ixion whirled in terror stilled ; and the demons of the night relented ,  |p152and  said that Eurydice might return with her husband to the world of light , upon the condition that Orpheus remain blindfoldedand not look back upon the wife who followed him . . . . " The legend does not tell us why Orpheus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that he saw where he had been , and saw Eurydice drawn back into the earth , and saw the earth close around her so that he could not follow . And legend tells of how thereafter Orpheus sang his sorrow , and how the maidens who had lived in light only and could not imagine where he had been , came to him and offered themselves to beguile him from his knowledge ; and how he refused them , and how in their anger then they shouted down his song , so that its magic could not stay them , and in their mania tore his body apart , and cast it in the River Hebrus , where his severed head continued to sing its wordlesssong ; and the very shores parted and widened so that the singing head might be borne in safety out to the landless sea . . . . This is the story of the Greek Orpheus which Vergil has told us , and to which we have listened . " A silence had come upon the room ; Horace dipped his cup into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods in their wisdom , " he said , " tell us all of our lives , if we will but listen . I speak to you now of another Orpheus  --  not the son of a god and goddess , but an Italian Orpheus whose father was a slave , and whose mother had no name . Some , no doubt , would scoff at such an Orpheus ; but they would scoff who have forgotten that all Romans are descended from a god , and bear the name of his son ; and from a mortal woman , and wear her humanity . Thus even a dwarf who wears upon his head a thatch of hay may have been touched by a god , if he springs from the earth that Mars loved . . . . This Orpheus of whom I speak received no golden lyre , but only a poor torch from a humble father who would have given his life that his son might be worthy of his dream . Thus was this young Orpheus in his childhood shown the light of Rome , equally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young manhood , at the cost of his father'ssubstance was shown too the source of what was said to be the light of all mankind that came from the mother city of all knowledge , Athens . Thus his love was no woman ; his Eurydice was knowledge , a dream of the world , to which he sang his song.  |p153But  the world of light that was his dream of knowledge became eclipsed by a civil war ; and forsaking the light , this young Orpheuswent into the darkness to retrieve his dream ; and at Philippi , almost forgetting his song , he fought against one whom he thought to represent the powers of darkness . And then the gods , or the demons  --  he knows not which , even now  --  granted him the gift of cowardice , and bade him flee the field with the power of his dream and knowledge intact , and bade him not to look back upon what he fled . But like the other Orpheus , just as he was safely escaped , he did look back ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of time and circumstance . He saw the world , and knew he was alone  --  without father , without property , without hope , without dreams . . . . It was only then that the gods gave to him their golden lyre , and bade him play not as they but as he wished . The gods are wise in their cruelty ; for now he sings , who would not have sung before . No Thracian maidens blandish him , nor offer him their charms ; he makes do with the honest whore , and for a fair price . It is the dogs of the world that yap at him as he sings , trying to drown his voice . They grow in number as more he sings ; and no doubt he , too , will suffer to have his limbs torn from his body , even though he sing against the yapping , and sing as he is carried to that sea of oblivion which will receive us all . . . . Thus , my masters and my betters , I have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you well with his remains . " My dear Vergil , I can not tell you how long the silence lasted ; and I can not tell you the source of that silence , whether it was shock or fear , or whether all ( like myself ) had been entranced as if by a true Orphic lyre . The torches , burning low , flickered ; and for a moment I had the odd feeling that we all , had , indeed , been in that underground of which Horace had been speaking , and were emerging from it , and dared not look back . Mevius stirred , and whispered fiercely , knowing that he would be heard by whom he intended : " Philippi , " he said . " Power of darkness , indeed ! Is this not treason against the triumvir ? Is this not treason ? " Octavius had not moved during Horace 's recital . He raised himself on his couch and sat beside Livia . " Treason ? " he said gently . " It is not treason , Mevius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rose from his couch and crossed over to where Horace sat . " Horace , will you permit me to join you ? " he asked . Our young friend nodded dumbly . Octavius sat beside him , and they spoke quietly . Mevius said no more that night . Thus , my dear Vergil , did our Horace , who has already endearedhimself to us , find the friendship of Octavius Caesar . All in all , it was a successful evening . IV . Letter : Mevius to Furius Bibaculus , from Rome ( January , 38 B.C. ) My dear Furius , I really have not the heart to write you at any length about that disastrous evening at the home of Claudius Nero last September , the only pleasant aspect of which was the absence of our " friend " Vergil . But perhaps it is just as well ; for certain events have transpired since that evening that make the whole affair even more ludicrous than it seemed then . I do n't really remember all who were there  --  Octavius , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bejeweledand perfumed , and Agrippa , smelling of sweat and leather . It was ostensibly a literary evening , but my dear , to what low state have our letters fallen ! Beside these , even that whining little fraud , Catullus , would have seemed almost a poet . There was Pollio , the pompous ass , to whom one must be pleasant because of his wealth and political power , and to whose works one must listen endlessly if one is foolish enough to attend his parties , stifling laughter at his tragedies and feigning emotion at his verses ; Maecenas again , who writes lugubrious poems in a Latin that seems almost like a foreign tongue ; Macer , who has discovered a Tenth Muse , that of Dullness ; and that extraordinary little upstart , Horace , whom , you will be happy to hear , I rather effectivelydisposed of during the course of the evening . Garrulous politicians , luxuriant magpies , and illiterate peasants deface the garden of the Muses . It 's a wonder that you and I can find the courage to persist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interestingthan the literary ones , and it is about that which I really want to write you . We all have heard of Octavius 's proclivities toward women . Ip155really had not given the reports so much credence before that evening  --  he is such a pallid little fellow that one might think a glass of unmixed wine and a fervent embrace would send him lifeless to join his ancestors ( whoever they might be )  --  but now I begin to suspect that there may be truth in them . The wife of our host was one Livia , of an old and conservative Republican family ( I have heard that her own father was slain by the Octavian army at Philippi ) . An extraordinarily beautiful girl , if you like the type  --  a modest and proper figure , blonde , perfectlyregular features , rather thin lips , softly spoken , and so forth ; very much the " patrician ideal , " as they say . She is quite young  --  perhaps eighteen  --  yet she has already given her husband , who must be thrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather visibly pregnant . I must say , we all had had a great deal to drink ; nevertheless , Octavius 's conduct was really extraordinary . He mooned over her like a love-sick Catullus , stroking her hand , whispering in her ear , laughing like a boy ( though of course he is really little more , despite the importance he has assigned to himself ) , all manner of nonsense ; and all this wholly in view of his own wife ( not that that really mattered , though she too is pregnant ) , and of Livia 's husband , who seemed either not to notice or to smile benignly , like an ambitious father rather than a husband whose honor ought to have been offended . At any rate , at the time I thought little of it ; I considered it rather vulgar behavior , but what ( I asked myself ) might one expect from the grandson of an ordinarysmall-town moneylender . If having filled one cart he wanted to ride in another that was full too , that was his business . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary scandal is buzzing over Rome that I am sure you would not forgive me if I failed to inform you of it . Less than two weeks ago , his erstwhile wife , Scribonia , gave birth to a girl child  --  though it would seem that even the adoptiveson of a god should have been able to manage a boy . On the same day of the birth , Octavius delivered to Scribonia a letter of divorce  --  which in itself was not surprising , the whole affair having been negotiated in advance , it is said . But  --  and here is the scandal  --  in the week following , TiberiusClaudius Nero gave Livia a divorce ; and the next day gavep156her ( though pregnant still ) . and with a substantial dowry , to Octaviusas wife ; the whole affair was sanctioned by the Senate , priests made sacrifices , the whole foolish business . How can anyone take such a man seriously ? And yet they do . V. The Journal of Julia , Pandateria ( A.D. 4 ) The circumstances of my birth were known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when at last I had the age to comprehend them , my father was the ruler of the world , and a god ; and the world has long understood that the behavior of a god , however odd to mortals , is natural to himself , and comes at last to seem inevitable to those who must worship him . Thus it was not strange to me that Livia should be my mother , and Scribonia merely an infrequent visitor to my home  --  a distantbut necessary relative whom everyone endured out of an obscuresense of obligation . My memories of that time are dim , and I do not fully trust them ; but it seems to me now that those years were ordinarily pleasant . Livia was firm , majestic , and coldly affectionate ; it was what I grew to expect . Unlike most men of his station , my father insisted that I be brought up in the old way , in his own household , in the care of Livia rather than a nurse ; that I learn the ways of the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient manner ; and yet that I be educated in the degree that would befit the daughter of an Emperor . So in my early years I wove with the slaves of the household , and I learned my letters , Latin and Greek , from my father 's slave Phaedrus ; and later I studied at wisdom under his old friend and tutor Athenodorus . Though I did not know it at the time , the most significant circumstance of my life was the fact that my father had no other children of his own . It was a fault of the Julian line . Though I must have seen him seldom in those years , his presencewas the strongest of any in my life . I learned my geography from his letters , which were read to me daily ; they were sent in packets from wherever he had to be  --  in Gaul , or Sicily , or Spain ; Dalmatia , Greece , Asia , or Egypt . As I said , I must have seen him seldom ; yet even now it seems that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost feelp157myself thrown into the air , and hear the ecstatic laughter of a child 's safe terror , and feel the hands catch me from the nothingnessinto which I had been tossed . I can hear the deep voice , comforting and warm ; I can feel the caresses upon my head ; I can remember the games of handball and pebbles ; and I can feel my legs strain up the little hills in the garden behind our house on the Palatine , as we walked to a point where we could see the city spread out like a gigantic toy beneath us . Yet I can not remember the face , then . He called me Rome , his " Little Rome . " My first clear visual memory of my father came when I was nine years old ; it was in his fifth consulship , and upon the occasionof his triple triumph for his victories in Dalmatia , Actium , and Egypt . Since that time , there have been no such celebrations of militaryexploits in Rome ; later my father explained to me that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar and barbaric , but that it was politically necessary at the time . Thus , I do not now know whether the grandeur I saw then has been enhancedby its uniquity and its subsequent absence , or whether it was the true grandeur of my memory . I had not seen my father for more than a year , and he had no chance to visit Rome before the ceremonial march into the city . It was arranged that Livia and I and the other children of the household should meet him at the city gates , where we were escortedby the senatorial procession and placed in chairs of honor to await his coming . It was a game to me ; Livia had told me that we were going to be in a parade , and that I must remain calm . But I could not restrain myself from jumping from my chair , and straining my eyes to find the approach of my father down the winding road . And when at last I saw him , I laughed and clapped my hands , and would have run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when he came near enough to recognize us , he spurred his horse ahead of the soldiers he was leading , and caught me in his arms , laughing , and then embraced Livia ; and he was my father . It was , perhaps , the last time that I was able to think of him as if he were a father like any other . For quickly he was moved away by the praetors of the Senate , who fastened about him a cloak of purple and gold and led him into the turreted chariot , and led Livia and me to stand besidep158him there ; and the slow procession toward the Forum began . I remember my fear and disappointment ; my father beside me , though he steadied me gently with his hand upon my shoulder , was a stranger . The horns and trumpets at the head of the processionsounded their battle calls ; the lictors with their laureled axes moved slowly ahead ; and we went into the city . The people crowded the squares where we passed and shouted so loudly that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum where we halted at last swarmed with Romans , so that not a stone upon the ground could be seen . For three days the ceremonies lasted . I spoke to my father when I could ; and though Livia and I were at his side nearly all the time , during his speeches and the sacrifices and the presentations , I felt him drawn away from me into the world that I was beginning to see for the first time . Yet he was gentle toward me all the time , and answered me when I spoke as if I mattered to him as much as I ever had . I rememberonce I saw drawn in one of the processions , on a cart gleaming with gold and bronze , the carven figure of a woman , larger than life , upon a couch of ebony and ivory , with two childrenlying on either side of her ; their eyes were closed , as if in sleep . I asked my father who the lady was supposed to be , and he looked at me a long time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She was Queen of a great country . She was an enemy to Rome ; but she was a brave woman , and she loved her country as much as any Roman might love his ; she gave her life so that she might not have to look upon its defeat . " Even now , after all these years , I remember the strange feeling that came over me upon hearing that name in those circumstances . It was , of course , a familiar name ; I had heard it often before . I thought then of my Aunt Octavia , who in fact shared the responsibility of the household with Livia , and whom I knew had once been married to this dead Queen 's husband , that Marcus Antonius who was also dead . And I thought of the children for whom Octavia cared and with whom I daily played and worked and studied : Marcellus and his two sisters , the fruit of her first marriage ; the two Antonias who were the issue of her marriage to Marcus Antonius ; Julius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at last of that little girl who was the new pet of the household , the little Cleopatra , daughter of MarcusAntonius and his Queen . But it was not the strangeness of that knowledge that caused my heart to come up in my throat . Though I did not have the words to say it then , I believe it occurred to me for the first time that even a woman might be caught up in the world of events , and be destroyed by that world.  |p1601  . Mail Packet : Letters to Octavius Caesar in Gaul , from Rome ( 27 B.C. ) To her husband , Livia sends greetings and prayers for his safety ; and according to his instructions , an account of those matters for which he has evidenced concern . The works which you set into motion before your departure northward proceed as you ordered . The repairs upon the Via Flaminia are completed , two weeks before the scheduled date that you gave to Marcus Agrippa , who will send you a full accountingof the work in the next packet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me daily , ask me to assure you that the census will be completed before your return ; and Maecenas projects that the increase in revenue from this revised tax base will be even more considerable than he had anticipated . Maecenas also has asked me to convey to you his pleasure in your decision not to invade Britain ; he is confident that negotiationwill accomplish as much ; and even if the negotiation does not , the possible cost of the conquest would outweigh the recoveryof the defaulted tribute . I , too , am happy at your decision ; but for the more affectionate reason of regard for your safety . I slight these reports , knowing that you will get fuller accounts from those who have the details more firmly in hand , and know/trig that your interest in hearing from me lies elsewhere . Your daughter is in good health , and she sends you her love . Yes : your letters are read to her daily , and she speaks of you often . You will be pleased to learn that the last week has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure that your letter upon the subject had a great effect . This morning she spent nearly two hours at the spinning wheel , and not once did she complain or speak disrespectfully to any who worked with her . She is at last , I believe , beginning to accustom herself to the notion that she may be both a woman and the daughter of an Emperor . Her health is excellent ; and she will have grown so that upon your return , you may hardly know her . The account of that other part of her education , upon which you have insisted and to which with some reluctance I have acquiesced , I shall leave to others , whose reports you will find included in these packets . There is a bit of gossip that will both please and amuse you . Maecenas has asked me to convey to you the information that he is at last acceding to your wishes and taking a wife ; he asked me to give you the news because ( he said ) the subject was too painfulfor him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a great show of his misery ; but I think he is rather enjoying the idea . His wife to be is one Terentia , of a family of no particular importance ; Maecenas sniffs , and says that he has nobility enough for them both . She is a pretty little thing , and seems content with the marriage ; it appears that she perfectly understands Maecenas 's propensities , and is willing to accept them . I believe that she will please you . Your sister sends you her affectionate greetings , and asks you to give the same to her Marcellus , whom she trusts has been a pleasant companion to his uncle . And I send you my love , and ask you to give to my Tiberius the same . Your family in Rome awaits your return . Gaius Octavius Caesar , at Narbonne in Gaul , from his servant and devoted friend , Phaedrus . I address you Gaius , for I speak on a household matter . Your daughter Julia is fast approaching that point in her edu/cation at which I can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with reluctance , for you know my fatherly fondness of her . You have proved me wrong . I doubted that any girl might progress in her studies as rapidly and as ably as might a boy of the same station , equally capable of diligence and understanding . Indeed , of the many of your relatives ' children of like age whom you have been kind enough to put under my tutelage , both boys and girls , she has made the most rapid progress , so that even at the age of eleven , she is rapidly approaching the point at which she should be put in another 's care . She composes easily in Greek ; she has mastered those more fundamental elements of rhetoric which I have exposed her to , though my teaching her such an unladylike subject has occasioned a minor scandal among her fellow pupils ; and your friend Horace intermittently aids her with that poetry in his own tongue , a literature of which my command is adequate but not sufficient for your daughter . I gather that the more feminine parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her musicianship is barely adequate , and though she has a natural physical grace , she does not really take to the more formal elements of her dancing lessons ; but I also gather that such fashionable accomplishments lie outside your own interest as well . Were I so foolish to think that you might be pleased by flattery , I should pretend no surprise and affect some such nonsense as expecting so much from the daughter of the son of a god , Emperor of all the world , and so forth . But we both know that her character is her own , and that it is a strong one . I propose , therefore , that in the near future her education be turned over to one more wise and learned than myself , that Athenodorus who was once your own teacher and who is now your friend . He knows her mind , they get on well , and he has consented to the task which I have had the presumption to suggest . I understand that he is to write you regarding another matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts upon this . I trust that your journey in Gaul will not keep you away from your daughter longer than is necessary . The only serious distractionin her studies with me is her longing for your presence . I am , Gaius , your faithful servant and , I trust , your friend , Phaedrusof Corinth.  |p163Athenodorus  to Octavius , greetings . As . you knew I would , I : applaud your decision to establish a system of schools in Gaul . ou are quite right ; if the people there are to become a part of Rome , they must have the Roman tongue , whereby they may know that history and that culture in which they are to thrive . I would to the gods that the fashionable riffraff here in Rome , some of whom you are pleased to call your friends , had so much concern for the education of their own children as you have for your subjects in distant lands . It may be that those in other lands shall become more Roman than we who remain in the heart of our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff the schools ; I shall , if you wish , make specific recommendations . Since you have brought peace and some measure of prosperity to our nation , learning has begun to flourish among those classes from whom you must draw your teachers , though perhaps flourishis too strong a word . In general , I would suggest : ( 1 ) that you not depend upon the easy idealism of the well-to-do young , whose enthusiasm is almost certain to disappear in the isolation of the provinces ; ( z ) that so far as possible you choose your teachers from native stock and not depend upon the Greeks or Egyptians or whatever , since their students must at least know what a Roman looks like if he is to really apprehend Roman culture ; and ( 3 ) that you riot depend upon slaves or even too heavily upon freedmen to fill those pedagogic ranks of which you speak . I think you must understand my reasons for this advice . I know that it has been the tradition in Rome to raise even a slave above a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is content to remaina slave , if he can become rich ; but in Gaul there will not be the opportunity for the kind of fiscal corruption that he can find in Rome , and he will be discontented . You know yourself that many slaves , especially the learned and rich ( our friend Phaedrus excepted , of course ) , are contemptuous of Rome and its ways , and resentful even of that condition out of which they have not chosen to purchase themselves . In short , in Gaul there will not be the complex of forces that operate here to subject them to some kind of order . I assure you that there are sufficient Italians , fromp164both the countryside and the city , who for a decent wage and some honor , would be happy to fulfill your purposes . As for the matter of your daughter : Phaedrus has spoken to me , and I have consented . I assume that you will approve . I have now educated so many of the Octavian clan that it would seem inappropriateto me for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; that is not my concern . In this matter , I insist that I remain your master ; and I should not like to see the final education of Julia in the hands of anyone other than myself . II . The Journal of Julia , Pandateria ( A.D. 4 ) For the past several years , since shortly after my arrival upon this island of Pandateria , it has been my habit to arise before dawn and to observe the first glimmer of light in the east . It has become nearly a ritual , this early vigil ; I sit without moving at an eastern window , and measure the light as it grows from gray to yellow to orange and red , and becomes at last no color but an unimaginable illumination upon the world . After the light has filled my room , I spend the morning hours reading one or another of those books from the library that I was allowed to bring with me here from Rome . The indulgence of my library was one of the few allowed me ; yet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has made this exile the most nearly endurable . For I have returned to that learning which I abandoned many years ago , and it is likely that I should not have done so had not I been condemned to this loneliness ; I sometimes can almost believe that the world in seeking to punish me has done me a service it can not imagine . It has occurred to me that this early vigil and this study is a regimen that I became used to many years ago , when I was little more than a child . When I was twelve years old , my father decided that it was time for me to forgo my childhood studies , and put myself in the care of his old teacher , Athenodorus . Before that , I had , in addition to the kind of education imposed upon my sex by Livia , merely been exercised in the reading and composition of Greek and Latin , which I found remarkably easy , and in arithmetic , which I found easy but dull . It was a leisurely kind of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of the day , with no very rigid schedule that I had to follow . But Athenodorus , who gave me my first vision of a world outside myself , my family , and even of Rome , was a stern and unrelenting master . His students were few  --  the sons of Octavia , both adopted and natural ; Livia 's sons , Drusus and Tiberius ; and the sons of various relatives of my father . I was the only girl among them , and I was the youngest . It was made clear to all of us by my father that Athenodorus was the master ; and despite whatever name and power the parents of his students might have , Athenodorus 's word in all matters was final , and that there was no recourse beyond him . We were made to arise before dawn and to assemble at the first hour at Athenodorus 's home , where we recited the lines from Homer or Hesiod or Aeschylus that we had been assigned the day before ; we attempted compositions of our own in the styles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . In the afternoon , the boys devoted themselves to exercises in rhetoric and declamation , and to the study of law ; such subjects being deemed inappropriate for me , I was allowed to use my time otherwise , in the study of philosophy , and in the elucidation of whateverpoems , Latin or Greek , that I chose , and in composition upon whatever matters struck my fancy . Late in the afternoon , I was allowed to return to my home , so that I might perform my household duties under the tutelage of Livia . It was a release that became increasingly irksome to me . For as within my body there had begun to work the changes that led me to womanhood , there began to work also in my mind the beginnings of a vision that I had not suspected before . Later , when we became friends , Athenodorus and I used to talk about the Roman distaste for any learning that did not lead to a practicalend ; and he told me that once , more than a hundred years before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a decree of the Senate , expelled from Rome , though it was a decree that could not be enforced . It seems to me that I was happy , then , perhaps as happy as I have been in my life ; but within three years that life was over , and it became necessary for me to become a woman . It was an exile from a world that I had just begun to see.  |p166III  . Letter : Quintus Horatius Flaccusto Albius Tibullus ( 25 B.C. ) My dear Tibullus , you are a good poet and my friend , but you are a fool . I will say it as plainly as possible : you are not to write a poem celebrating the marriage of young Marcellus and the Emperor 's daughter . You have asked me for my advice , I have given it as strongly as I might give a command , and for the several reasons that I shall proceed to enumerate . First : Octavius Caesar has made it clear , even to me and Vergil , who are among his closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded , directly or indirectly , to the personal affairs of any member of his family in one of our own poems . It is a principle upon which he stands firm , and it is a principle which I understand . Despite your hints to the contrary , he is deeply attachedboth to his wife and his daughter ; he does not wish to condemn the bad poem which offers them praise , nor does he wish to praise the good poem which might offer them offense . Moreover , his life with his family is nearly his only respite from the burdensome and difficult task he has in attempting to run this chaotic world that he has inherited . He does not wish that respiteendangered . Second : your natural talent does not lie in the direction that you describe , and you are unlikely to write a good poem upon this subject . I have admired your poems upon your lady friends ; I have not admired your poems upon your friend and commander in chief , Messalla . To write an indifferent poem upon a dangeroustopic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were able to somehow turn the natural bent of your talent in another direction , the few attitudes you hint at in your letter convince me that you had better not try what you propose . For no man may write a good poem the worth of whose subject he doubts ; and no poet can will away his misgivings . I say this not in recrimination of your uncertainties , my friend ; I say it merely as a fact . Were I to engage myself in the composition of such a poem as you propose , I might discover that I had the same ones.  |p167And  yet I believe that I would not . You hint that you suspect a coldness in the Emperor 's feelings toward his daughter , and that in the marriage he is " using " her for purposes of state . The latter may be true ; the former is not . I have known Octavius Caesar for more than ten years ; he is my friend , and we are on truly equal terms . As any friend might do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , I have doubted him when I judged he merited doubt , and I have criticized him when I believed that he deserved criticism . I have done these publicly , and with utter freedom . Our friendship has not suffered . Thus , when I speak to you now of this matter , you will understand that I speak as freely as I ever have , and as I ever will . Octavius Caesar loves his daughter more than you understand ; if he has a fault , it is that his feeling for her is too deep . He has overseen her education with more care than many a less busy fatherhas given to that of a son ; nor has he been content to limit her learning to the weaving and sewing and singing and luteplayingand the usual smattering of letters that most women get in school . Julia 's Greek is now better than her father 's ; her knowledge of literature is impressive ; and she has studied both rhetoric and philosophy with Athenodorus , a man whose wisdom and learning could augment even our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often has had to be absent from Rome , not a week has gone by that his daughter has not received in the mail a packet of letters from her father ; I have seen some of them , and they display a concern and kindness that is indeed touching . And upon those welcome occasions when his duties allowed him the freedom of his family and his home , he spent what might seem to some an inordinate amount of time with his daughter , behavingwith the utmost simplicity and joy in her presence . I have seen him roll hoops with her as if he , too , were a child , and let her ride upon his shoulders as if he were a horse , and play blindman'sbuff ; I have seen them fish together from the banks of the Tiber , laughing in delight when their hooks snagged a tiny sunfish ; and I have seen them walk in perfect companionship in the fields beyond their home , picking wild flowers for the dinner table.  |p168But  if you have doubts in that part of your soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not allay them , though I might erase them from that part of your mind that is a man 's . You know that if another father chose for his daughter a husband as rich and promising as young Marcellus , you would applaud his foresight and his concern . You know , too , that the " youth " of Julia in this matter would , in another instance , be cause for another kind of concern . How old was that lady ( whom you have chosen to disguiseas Delia ) when first you began your campaign against her virtue ? Sixteen ? Seventeen ? Younger ? No , my dear Tibullus , you are well advised not to write this poem . There are many other subjects , and many other places to find them . If you wish to retain the admiration of your Emperor , stick to those poems about your Delias , which you do so well . I assure you that Octavius reads them and admires them ; hard as it may be for you to believe , when he reads a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Journal of Julia , Pandateria ( A.D. 4 ) In my life , I had three husbands , none of whom I loved . . . . Yesterday morning , not knowing what I wished to say , I wrote those words ; and I have been pondering what they might mean . I do not know what they mean . I only know that the question occurredto me late in my life , at a time when it no longer mattered . The poets say that youth is the day of the fevered blood , the hour of love , the moment of passion ; and that with age come the cooling baths of wisdom , whereby the fever is cured . The poets are wrong . I did not know love until late in my life , when I could no longer grasp it . Youth is ignorant , and its passion is abstract . I was betrothed first when I was fourteen years of age to my cousin , Marcellus , who was the son of my father 's sister Octavia . It was perhaps a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that such a marriage seemed to me perfectly ordinary at the time . Ever since I could remember , Marcellus had been a familiar part of our household , along with the other children of Octavia and Livia ; I had grown up with him , but I did not knowp169him . Now , after nearly thirty years , I have hardly a memory of what he was like or even of his physical appearance . He was tall , I believe , and blond in the Octavian way . But I remember the letter my father sent informing me of the betrothal . I remember the tone of it . It was almost as if he were writing to a stranger ; his tone was pompous and stiff , and that was unlike him . He wrote from Spain , where for nearly a year he had been engaged in putting down the border insurrections , a mission upon which Marcellus , though only seventeen years of age , had accompanied him . Persuaded ( he said ) by Marcellus 's fortitude and loyalty , and concerned that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beyond dispute , he had determined that this marriage was in the best interests of myself and of our family . He wished me happiness , regretted that he would not be in Rome to take his proper part in the ceremony , and said that he was asking his friend Marcus Agrippa to take his place ; and told me that Livia would inform me further upon what was expected of me . At the age of fourteen , I believed myself to be a woman ; I had been taught to believe so . I had studied with Athenodorus ; I was the daughter of an Emperor ; and I was to be married . I believe I behaved in a most urbane and languid fashion , until the urbanity and languidness became almost real ; I had no apprehension of the world that I was beginning to enter . And Marcellus remained a stranger . He returned from Spain , and we spoke distantly , as we always had done . The arrangements for the wedding proceeded as if neither of us was involved in our fates . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a ceremony in the old fashion . Marcellus gave me a gift , before witnesses , of an ivory box inlaid with pearls from Spain , and I received it with the ritual words ; the night before the wedding , in the presence of Livia and Octavia and Marcus Agrippa , I bade farewell to the toys of my childhood , and gave those that would burn to the household gods ; and late that night Livia , acting as my mother , braided my hair into the six plaits that signifiedmy womanhood , and fastened them with the bands of white wool . I went through the ceremony as if through a dream . The guests and relatives gathered in the courtyard ; the priests said thep170things that priests say ; the documents were signed , witnessed , and exchanged ; and I spoke the words that hound me to my husband . And in the evening , after the banquet , Livia and Octavia , according to ceremony , dressed me in the bridal tunic and led me to Marcellus 's chamber . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , yawning ; the bridal flowers were strewn carelessly upon the floor . " It is late , " Marcellus said , and added in the voice he had used toward me as a child ; " get to bed . " I lay beside him ; I imagine I must have been trembling . He yawned once more , turned upon his side away from me , and in a few moments was asleep . Thus did my wifehood begin ; and it did not change substantiallyduring the two years of my marriage to Marcellus . As I wrote earlier , I hardly remember him now ; there is little reason why I should . V. Letter : Livia to Octavius Caesar in Spain ( 25 B.C. ) To her husband , Livia sends affectionate greetings . I have followedyour instructions ; your daughter is married ; she is well . I hasten over this bare information so that I might write of the matter that is of more immediate concern to me : the state of your health . For I have heard ( do not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precarious than you have let me know ; and thus I begin to apprehend the urgency you have felt in seeing your daughter safely married , and am therefore more ashamed than I might have been of my opposition to the marriage , and I sorrow at the unhappiness that that opposition must have caused you . Please be assured now that my resentment is gone , and that at last my pride in our marriage and our duty has laid to rest my maternal ambitions for my own son . You are right ; Marcellus carries the name of the Claudian , the Julian , and the Octavian tribes , whereas my Tiberius carries the name only of the Claudian . Your decision is , as usual , the intelligent one . I forget sometimes that our authority is more precarious than it seems . I implore you to return from Spain . It is clear that the climate there encourages those fevers to which you are subject , and that in such a barbaric place you can not receive proper care . In thisp171your physician agrees with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to you within the week . Octavia sends her love , and asks that you guard the safety of her son ; your wife also sends her love , and her prayers for your recovery , and for the well-being of her son Tiberius . Please return to Rome . VI . Letter : Quietus Horatius Flaccus to Publius Vergilius Maro , at Naples ( 23 B.C. ) My dear Vergil , I urge you to come to Rome with all possible speed . Ever since his return from Spain , our friend 's health has declined ; and now his condition is exceedingly grave . The fever is constant ; he can not rise from his bed ; and his body has shrunken so that his skin seems like cloth upon frail sticks . Though we all put on cheerful countenances , we have come to despair of his life . We do not deceive him ; he , too , feels that his life draws to a close ; he has given to his co-consul his records of the army and of revenue , and has given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate succession of his authority . Only his physician , his intimate friends , and his immediate family are allowed in his presence . A great calm has come upon him ; it is as if he wishes to savor for the last time all that he has held dearest to his heart . Both Maecenas and I have been staying here at his private house on the Palatine , so that we might be near him when he wishes aid or comfort . Livia attends hint meticulously and with the dutifulness that he so admires in her ; Julia laughs and teases him , as he so enjoys , when she is in his presence , and weeps most pitifully when she is out of his sight ; he and Maecenas speak fondly of the days of their youth ; and Agrippa , strong as he is , can hardly keep his composure when he speaks to him . Though he would not impose himself and though he does not say so , I know that he wants you here . Sometimes , when he is too weary to converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some of those poems of ours that he has most admired ; and yesterdayhe recalled that happy and triumphant autumn , only a few years ago , when he returned from Samos , after the defeat of the Egyptian armies , and we were all together , and you read to himp172the completed Georgics . And he said to me , quite calmly and without pity of self : " If I should die , one of the things that I shall most regret is not having been able to attend the completion of our old friend 's poem upon the founding of our city . Do you think it would please him to know this ? " Though I was hardly able to speak , I said , " I am sure it would , my friend . " He said , " Then you must tell him so when you see him . " " I shall tell him when you have recovered , " I said . He smiled . I could not endure it longer . I made some apology , and went from his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short . He is in no pain ; he retainshis faculties ; but his will is dying with his body . Within the week , if his condition does not improve , his physician ( one Antonius Musa , whose abilities , despite his fame , I do not trust ) is prepared to put into effect a final and drastic remedy . I urge you to attend him before that desperation is performed . VII . Medical Directive of Antonius Musa , the Physician , to His Assistants ( 23 B.C. ) The Preparation of the Baths . Three hundred pounds of ice , to be delivered to the residence of the Emperor Octavius Caesar , at the designated hour . This may be obtained from the storehouse of Asinius Pollio on the Via Campana . The ice is to be broken into pieces of the size of a tightly closed fist , and only those pieces that can be seen to be free of sediment are to be used . Twentyfiveof these pieces are to be put into the bath , which will contain water to the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are melted . The Preparation of the Ointment . One pint of my own powder , to which has been added two spoonfuls of finely ground mustard seed ; which mixture is to be added to two quarts of the finest olive oil , which is to be heated just below the point of boiling , and then allowed to cool to the exact degree of body warmth . The Treatment of the Patient . The patient is to be immersed fully , with the water covering every part of his body except the head , into the cold bath , where he is to remain for the length ofp173time required to count slowly to one hundred . He is then to be removed and wrapped in the undyed blankets of wool , which have been heated over hot stones . He is to remain wrapped until he sweats freely , at which point the entirety of his body is to be anointed with the prepared oil . He is then to be returned to the cold bath , to which has been added sufficient ice to return it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times ; then the patient will be allowed to rest for two hours . This routine of treatment shall be continued until the patient 's fever subsides . VIII . The Journal of Julia , Pandateria ( A.D. 4 ) When my father returned home from Spain , I knew at once the reason for my marriage . He had not expected to survive even the journey to his family , so grave had been his illness in Spain ; to insure my future , he gave me to Marcellus ; and to insure the future of what he often called his " other daughter , " he gave Rome to Marcus Agrippa . My marriage to Marcellus was largely a ritualaffair ; technically I became nonvirginal ; but I was hardly touched by the union and I remained a girl , or nearly so . It was ( luring the illness of my father that I became a woman , for I saw the inevitability of death and knew its smell and felt its presence . I remember that I wept , knowing that my father would die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to know that loss was the condition of our living . It is a knowledge that one can not give to another . Yet I tried to give it to Marcellus , since he was my husband and I had been taught my proper behavior . He looked at me in bewilderment , and then said that however unfortunate , Rome would endure the loss , since our Emperor had had the foresight to leave his affairs in order . I was angry then , for I felt that my husband was cold and I knew that he thought himself to be the heir to my father 's power , and foresaw the day when he too would be an Emperor ; now I know that if he were cold and ambitious , it was the only way he knew ; it was the life to which he had been reared . My father 's recovery from the illness that should have led to his death was regarded by the world as a miracle emanating **25;14082;TOOLONG . How could she possibly go to him now calmly and let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm , her moments of freedom slid away with frighteningspeed . As in a daze , she found herself fed , bathed , perfumed and groomed , all against her stunned will . No moment of that morning11 was hers . As they tugged and pulled and goaded , she thought she might scream in rage at them to leave her be . The noon meal came and though she was not hungry , she pretended to eat so they would give her rest , dropping the food from the window to a hungry mongrel when they were n't looking . But as soon as the tray was taken away , everything began again . No part of her body was left untouched , nomatter what shame it caused her , and when she tried to protest , the three argued . " But , lass , a touch of essence here or there will make a strong , grand man from a shy , bashful sort . " And Heather thought wildly that just the opposite was needed for the man she was to marry . Finally she was readied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What she saw was herself , yet not the Heather she had alwaysseen . She had never looked this way before . For a frightening moment she caught a glimpse of the beauty that others saw and found uncommon . Her hair , brushed to a silky sheen , was coiled intricately through itself and around the top of her head to resemble the coiffure of a Greek goddess . A tiara of golden spikes and pearls crowned her head , and below it , blue feline eyes stared back at her in alarm . The definite slant of her eyes fringed by the long , sooty lashes was made even more noticeable by the manner of hairstyle which was drawn tightly from her face . Her cheekbones , fragile and high , allowing for a slight hollownessbeneath them , had been pinched and were no longer pale . Her soft , pink mouth was slightly opened with her awe . " A lass more fair than you does not live , Maid Heather . " The moment was lost for Heather and again she surveyed her raiments . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own wedding gown , an elegant garment resembling somewhat a monk 's habit completewith hood . It was ice blue in color and made of rich , heavy satin cut in simple , slender lines . The sleeves reached to the wrist and were , as the skirt of the gown , slightly flared . Elaborate golden embroidery and countless seed pearls embellished the hood and sleeves , and placed about the hips was a girdle of great beauty and considerable fortune . It was of gold leather and was richly sewn with pearls and rubies . A train a good arm 's length longer than herself waited to be attachedp71with gold chains and its heavy satin was richly embroidered and embellishedwith the gold and seed pearls . A costume fit for a queen , Heather thought drearily . She frowned suddenly and moved to the window again . The hour of her doom was growing near . Time was fast draining away and still she trembled . " For once in my life , " she prayed silently , " please  --  oh , please let me be brave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched in . " Well now , I see you 're all dressed in your finery , " the woman sneered . " And I 'm supposin ' you be thinkin ' you look pretty , ai n't you ? But you look no better'n what you did in my old dress . " Mrs. Todd stiffened her spine as if the insult had been directed at her . " I beg your pardon , madam ! " " Oh , hush your mouth , " Aunt Fanny snapped at the woman . " Please , Aunt Fanny , " Heather pleaded softly . " Mrs. Todd has worked hard . " " Aye , I 'm sure she had to with you . " " Madam , " Mrs. Todd said coldly . " The girl is not deserving of criticism . She be by far the comeliest maid I 've ever had the pleasure to attend or have ever seen for that matter . " " She 's the daughter of Satan , " Aunt Fanny hissed . " Her beauty is his doing , and ' cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's seen her . It 's the devil 's way of makin ' man lust after a witch , and to me she 's ugly . That man she 's marryin ' is her just mate . The two of them be of the devil ! " " That 's nonsense ! " Mrs. Todd cried . " The girl is an angel . " " Angel , is it ? I do n't suppose she told you why she 's gettin ' wedded so soon , did she ? " From the open doorway where he had come to stand and listen , Uncle John spoke with a slow but steady voice . " It 's ' cause Captain Birmingham wants her without delay , ai n't it , Fanny ? " The obese woman turned in a huff , ready to snarl a denial at him , but something , perhaps her fear of the Yankee sea captain , made her silence the angry words that came to her lips before they were spoken . Instead , she whirled on her niece and made as if to pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reasoning the less pain she suffered now , the better prepared she would be for it later . " I can say I 'll be happy to get you off my hands , " Aunt Fanny spat . " You 've naught been a pleasure to have around . " Heather flinched under the biting remark . Tears came to her eyes asp72she turned once again to the window . All her life she had lacked the love of her kinsfolk . What her father had given to her had been marred by unhappiness , and now she was destined to go through life without knowing of another . Even the son , if it was to be a son , whom she was carrying would probably be encouraged to hate his mother by a father who was forced to be one . There would never be another chance for love in her life . An hour later , stiff and unsmiling , Heather descended from the steps of the rented carriage with the aid of Uncle John . The mighty cathedral loomed upward , overpowering in its immensity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps , clinging to her uncle 's arm . She was numb to the world about her . She did things mechanically . She put one foot in front of the other as she was towed along by her uncle . Mrs. Todd , who had come along for last minute assistance , walked beside her , fussing with the bridal cape that she held draped over her arms . The woman would have swooned if some harm had come to it . She worried and clucked like a mother hen over her brood , but Heather scarcely noticed her . She stared straight ahead toward the high , main portal of the cathedral , coming closer with each step she was taking . It gaped dark and sinister , waiting with maddeningpatience to swallow her life . Then she was under its arched frame , moving into the vestry , and she stopped because her uncle stopped . The organ music drummed on her heart and sounded loud in her ears . Mrs. Todd flitted about her , straightening the hood over her head , attaching the long train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind to its full length . Someone handed her a small , white Bible with a golden cross stamped in the soft leather , and she took it without thinking . " Pinch your cheeks , Heather , " Aunt Fanny scolded harshly from somewhere near . " And stop lookin ' so frightened or I 'll pinch you myself . " Mrs. Todd glared at the woman , then did her duty by bringing some life to Heather 's cheeks herself . " You 're the queen of the day , love , " she whispered to Heather and gave a final adjustment to the crown and hood . The music changed and so did the beat of Heather 's heart . The shock brought her out of her daze . " ' T is time , love , " Mrs. Todd said quietly . " Is  --  is he in there ? " Heather murmured to the woman , hoping greatly that he had refused finally to come . " Who , love ? " the woman questioned.  | " She 's talkin ' about the Yankee , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Todd replied kindly . " He 's standing before the altar waiting for you . And a high handsome man he is too , from what I can see of him . " Heather swayed weakly against Mrs. Todd and the older woman steadied her with a helping arm and a smile and walked her to the door . " It will all be over in a moment , love , " she said , giving a final encouragement before the door swung open . Then Lord Hampton was offering his arm to her and she took it mechanically , moving on her own quaking limbs beside him down the aisle . She could feel the pounding of her heart inside her breast and the weight of the Bible in her hand . The heavy burden of the train tugged at her shoulders , seeming to hold her back , but she moved on as the great organ drowned out all other sounds , even the beat of her heart . The candles at the altar burned beyond the group standing there , making them dark shadows in a dimly-lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his height . No one in the world seemed as tall as he at the moment . She came closer and the candlelight touched on his face , and for a split second Heather was halted by the cold , stark features . She had an overwhelming desire to flee . Her bottom lip quivered , and she caught at it nervously with her teeth to still its cowardly shaking as Lord Hampton moved away from her , leaving her alone . The green eyes before her roamed insultingly over her person , divesting her of her bridal gown in a cruel , heartless way , and Heather trembled more violently . The Yankee stretched out a strong , brown hand and offered it to her as his leer brought a deep blush to her pale face . Reluctantly she lifted her hand , which was cold as ice , and placed it in his much larger , much warmer one , and he drew her the remainder of the way to the altar steps . Tall and powerful he stood , garmented regally in black velvet and flawless white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evil . He could draw her soul from her body and never feel remorse . If she were brave , she would turn now before the vows were spoken and fly from the insanity of what they were doing to her . Every day women gave birth to bastard sons and raised them in the streets . Why was she not so courageous ? Surely having to beg for food and being destitute were lesser evils than being thrown into the fires of hell.  |p74But  even as she argued with herself , she slid to her knees with the man beside her and bowed her head to pray for the blessings of God . Time stood still as they were swept into the marriage ceremony , and all the while every nerve , every sense she possessed screamed of the presence beside her . The lean , well manicured hands held her gaze and the closeness of his body lent to her nostrils a scent of his cologne , not overpowering like so many strong perfumes meant to cover the stenchof unwashed bodies , but fleeting and inoffensive , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well washed , " she mused . She heard him respond to the priest 's urging in a firm , steady voice . " I , Brandon Clayton Birmingham , take you , Heather Brianna Simmons , to be my lawful wedded wife  --  " Thankfully appearing not to falter , she spoke the same words , pledging herself to this man in soft tones . It seemed only a moment later that he was sliding a gold band upon her finger and they were again bowing their heads before the priest . She rose finally on shaky limbs as her new husband drew to his full height . He looked down at her unkindly , his green eyes freezing to her hesitant gaze . " I believe it is customary for the groom to kiss the bride , " he said . She replied in a nervous strained voice . " Yes . " She feared she would faint under his stare . Her heart raged so turbulentlythat her gown fluttered over her heart . His long , brown fin- gers moved around the delicate bones of her jaw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away while his other arm slid behind her back under the loose , flowing train . He crushed her to him suddenly in a fierce , possessive embrace , and Heather 's eyes widened and her face drained of color . She felt the eyes of the others on them , but he seemed not to mind . On the contrary , he seemed to welcome their stares . His arm was like a band of iron around her , squeezing the life from her small body , pressing her tighter against him . His head loweredand his parted lips moved over hers in a passionate kiss . His open mouth was wet and searing , demanding and insulting , leaving her little dignity . Her hand struggled up and strained against him piteously . From somewhere near she heard Lord Hampton cough uncomfortablyand her uncle murmur something unintelligible . Finally the priest touched Brandon 's arm and spoke awkwardly . " You will have time for that later , my son . The others are waiting to congratulate you . "  |p75At  last his grip slackened and she could breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint of his fingers was clearly marked upon her fair skin . She turned on wobbly knees and smiled tremulously as Lord and Lady Hampton came up to her . The kindly man gave her a fatherly kiss upon the brow . " I hope I have not done wrongly with you , Heather , " he said uncertainly , glancing up at Captain Birmingham who stood stiff and unyieldingbeside her . " My intentions were to see you cared for , but  --  " " Please , " she murmured , reaching out to place shaking fingers against his lips . She could n't let him finish . If she heard her fears put into words , she would run shrieking from them all , tearing at her garments and hair in an excess of insane passion . Lady Hampton glanced up timorously at the Yankee captain who stared coldly ahead , his mighty seaman 's legs planted firmly under him , his hands clasped behind his back . He appeared to be standing on the deck of a ship , staring out across an ocean . Her hands trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two women , both small and slight , clung to each other in their distress . As if the thought just occurred to him , Lord Hampton quickly made a proposal . " You will stay the night at Hampshire Hall . There will be more room there for you than in the ship 's cabin . " He did n't add that any room there would be easily accessible to him if Heather screamed while in the hands of her new husband . Brandon turned his frigid gaze upon the smaller man . " And of course you insist upon that also , " he growled . His lordship faced him with an unwavering stare . " Yes , I do , " he said calmly . A muscle twitched angrily in Brandon 's cheek , but he said nothing , not even when his lordship suggested it was time they left for the wedding feast at Hampshire Hall . He just took his bride 's arm in a firm , solid grasp and allowed the others to precede them from the church . Heather , nervous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred going out on Lord Hampton 's arm , but Brandon clearly had no intentions of letting her do so . His mastery over her had already begun and she knew that she would never again belong to herself . His possession of her was complete  --  except for perhaps her soul , but he would not stop until that too belonged to him . Much to her dismay , she was halted by the sudden refusal of herp76cape to be drawn with her up the aisle . Frantically she looked over her shoulder to see what was binding it , and Brandon turned his black scowl on her as she appeared to tug away from his unrelenting grasp . " Please , " she started in a quavery voice , lifting a hand to explain her seeming reluctance to move forward . His eyes went past her toward the garment caught on a splintered pew , and he grinned down at her sardonically and went back to releaseit . Heather watched him nervously , clasping the Bible she held in both hands . Her palms were moist and her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as his . It was rather loose and slid around her finger easily . Just to look at it brought more fear to her heart , knowing what it would mean . Brandon detached the golden embroidery from the rough splinter and tossed the end of the cape over his arm in a careless manner and came back to her . Again his hand slid under her arm . " There 's no need to distress yourself , my love , " he said mockingly . " The garment is intact . " " Thank you , " she murmured softly , raising her eyes uncertainly to his . His taunting smile seared her and brought a rush of color to her face . He was cruelly laughing at her and her stung pride would not allow that . It brought her chin up defiantly . She glared at him through the tears that sprang to her eyes . " Were I a man you would not smirk so easily , " she spat , hating him . He raised a finely arched eyebrow and chuckled unmercifully at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be in this situation . " Her blush deepened . Infuriated and seething with anger and humiliation , she tried to wrench free from his long fingers but he only tightenedthem around her arm . " You can not escape me again , my beauty , " he said easily , seeming to enjoy her distress . " You are now forever and for always mine . Marriage with me is what you wanted and that is what you shall have for the rest of your life  --  unless by chance you are widowed . But do not fear , love , I have no desire to leave you too soon . " Her face turned ashen under his careless gibe , and she swayed on her feet , feeling faint . He steadied her by drawing her near , and he raised her chin so he could gaze down into her eyes . His own burned like coals of green fire . " Not even your Lord Hampton will be able to save you from me now , though I see he will try . But what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivery spasm of fright rushing through her body , and her head fell back weakly against his arm . " What a beauty you are , my sweet , " he said huskily . " I sha n't grow tired of you too soon . " Lord Hampton , tense and nervous at their long delay with coming from the church , could not wait a moment longer . He hurried back in to find Heather clutched in her husband 's arms , her head thrown back , her eyes closed , her face very pale . " Has she fainted ? " he asked anxiously , coming to them . The fire in Brandon 's eyes died and he glanced at the smaller man briefly . " No , " he replied and returned his gaze to his wife . " She will be better in a moment . " " Then come , " his lordship said irritably . " The carriage is waiting . " He turned and left them , and Brandon 's arm tightened around his wife . " Shall I carry you , my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting his handsome mouth . Heather 's eyes flew open . " No ! " she cried , flinging herself from him in a sudden burst of pride and energy . His laugh straightened her spine even more . With a toss of her head she walked from him , but he still held her train over his arm and she came up short when the extra length ran out . She glanced back audaciously and glared at him when he would not release it . The corner of his mouth went up scornfully as he came to her side again . " Your escape is impossible , my love . I have a very possessive na-ture . " " Then bed me here if you must , " she hissed , hate giving virulence to her tongue . " But do it quickly , for the others wait . " His jaw tightened and his eyes grew cold . " No , " he said , taking her arm . " I shall take my pleasure of you slowly and at my leisure . Now come , for as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were met by a shower of wheat . Sparse as the wedding party was , Lady Hampton would not let the simple customgo undone . Later they moved to the waiting carriage . Aunt Fanny was silent with the Yankee so near . Uncle John , hesitant and unsure of himself , helped Lady Hampton down the steps of the cathedral and her husband , Lord Hampton , hung back , watching Captain Birminghamassist his young bride . Uncle John handed his wife and Lady Hampton into the carriage and climbed in after them . As Heather drew near she found the three squeezed together on one side , Lady Hampton suffering greatly byp78being in the middle . The poor woman 's complaints went unuttered however , and permitting herself a small smile after all that she had been through , Heather lifted her skirts to climb up into the landau . She was greatly surprised when she found herself being slung up in her husband 's arms and placed aboard . Without thanking him for embarrassingher , she sank down on the vacant seat and gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw his weight down beside her , and she was squeezed unmercifully when Lord Hampton got in also . To allow herself more room she tried to sit up on the edge of the seat , but she found herself unable to move because her husband was sitting on her skirt . She glanced up at him , but he was staring out the window and the muscles in the side of his face were tense with anger . An unintelligible , cowardly murmur escaped her lips as she pushed back against the seat again , fear catching at her heart . Their bodies were so close , his shoulder overlapped hers and the back of his arm rubbed against her breast . The full length of her thigh was pressed to the granite-hard muscles of his . As the chaise rolled along the cobbled streets , she made an awkwardattempt to converse with Lord and Lady Hampton although they were just as tense as she . Her tone was almost inaudible when she spoke and cracked with nervousness . To save face she soon fell silent , afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were jostled and bounced and Heather wondered frantically if any bone in her body would be left unbroken . Though Lord Hampton was not a big man , he was still larger than she and between her husband , whose tall broad-shouldered frame gave no inch , and his lordship 's , she , being much smaller than the two , endured much . The pressure of Brandon 's arm against her breast alone was sending her into a state of shock . Finally the carriage drew up before Hampshire Hall . Brandon descendedfirst and with capable hands reached up , clasped her under the arms and swung her down beside him . She straightened her clothes with a jerk and flung her long train over her arm with an arrogant toss of her head . Inside the mansion she stopped to discard the heavy cape and , much to her displeasure , was helped by her husbandwho unfastened the gold chains from her shoulders . His long fingers worked with great dexterity . The wedding feast was already laid upon the table when they entered the dining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table and motioned for Heather and Brandon to sit onp79one side , Uncle John and Aunt Fanny on the other . They lifted their glasses in toast to the young couple . To a most happy and rewarding marriage despite what has here before taken place , " his lordship offered . Then he added as an afterthought , " And may the child be a fine boy . " A red glow spread over Heather 's features as she lifted her glass to her lips . But she did not drink . She would not hope for a boy and give this man more confidence in himself . She noticed , however , that he drank the champagne down quite easily , and she eyed him distastefully . The meal went too quickly for Heather 's peace of mind , though by the time they left the table it was past the hour of eleven . The men took their brandies into the drawing room as Lady Hampton propelledAunt Fanny off to her sleeping quarters and drew Heather to the bedchamber prepared for her and the Yankee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a night garment of transparentfilmy blue cloth lay on the bed . Heather blanched white at the sight of it , but Lady Hampton led her to a bench in front of a huge mirror and pressed her down into it . " I shall return with some wine when you 're ready , " the woman murmured , kissing Heather 's brow . " Perhaps it will help . " As the maid drew her bridal gown from her and uncoiled her hair , Heather knew nothing would protect her from her fear . She would have to be unconscious before she would not quake with fright . " I might as well be a virgin , " she thought with some surpise , " as much as I tremble . " Brushed a hundred strokes , her hair was left loose and flowing , reaching down to her hips . Her clothes were taken away  --  not even a robe was left  --  and Heather , sitting on her heels in the middle of the bed and wearing only a gown of gossamer to veil her nakedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ordeal that was to come . Outside the bedroom , footsteps clicked against the marble floors , but she breathed a sigh of relief . They belonged to a woman . Lady Hampton opened the door and came in , carrying a tray bearinga wine decanter and two glasses . She set it down upon a table beside the bed and poured Heather a glass as she inspected the work the girls had done . She nodded with approval . " You are even more beautiful now , my dear , than you were in your bridal gown , impossible though it may seem . You were a vision . I felt so proud . I just wish there would have been more time to invite guests.  |p80You  needed to be shown off . I could have told them you were my own sweet . How I grieve that your mother died so soon and never knew you . She would have been proud of you . " " Proud of me ? " Heather asked forlornly , looking down at her stomach . " I 've brought disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton smiled at her gently . " Nonsense , my dear . Sometimesa girl can not help the things that happen to her . She 's just a victim of circumstances . " " Or of Yankees , " Heather murmured . Her ladyship laughed softly . " Yes , or of Yankees , but at least he 's young and handsome and clean . When my husband first told me of your predicament and said a Yankee seaman was to blame , I was sick with worry . I thought he would be old and lecherous . Even your aunt confided that she expected the man to be so . It was probably a great disappointment to her that he was not , considering what you 've sufferedin her hands . But he 's so magnificent . Truly all your babies will be fine and beautiful and I suppose you 'll have many . " Lady Hampton 's voice dwindled off to barely a whisper as she remembered the passionate embrace Captain Birmingham had given his young bride and the rock hard expression that had been on his faceafterward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said aloud , " Yes , I suppose we 'll be having many . " She was thinking of the ease with which Brandon had planted hisseed in her . She would no doubt be giving birth to many . Lady Hampton rose to go and Heather looked up pleadingly . " Must you go now ? " she asked in a quavery voice . The woman nodded her head slowly . " Yes , my dear . We 've held him at bay long enough . We can not any longer . But if you should need us , we will be near . " The woman 's meaning was not lost upon Heather . She knew if she called out for assistance they would come , despite the fact that they had no right to interfere . Again she was alone and frightened . But after she had tasted bitterlyher husband 's mockery , she was determined now not to cringe and cower from him . " Let him see that I am willing , " she thought cunningly . " He will not choose to hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , startling her when the sound of his footfalls came in the hall . Her face flamed as she saw the door open , and then she found herself staring across the width of the roomp81into his green eyes . His gaze lowered and a fire was kindled as he raked her body with his stare . Heather sat awkwardly , her heart beating wildly . The bedcovers had been drawn to the end of the bed out of her reach and she longed to pull them to her . The gown she wore was like a soft blue veil over her body , more alluring and revealing than bare flesh . It was tied with soft ribbons at the waist on each side , but from the waist up and the waist down it was slit with no further ornament to hold it together . As a result the sides of her breasts were exposed and the long , slender limbs were laid bare to his gaze . The hardest thing she ever had to do in her life was to sit calmly before him and let him look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , my love , " he said hoarsely , coming forward to the bed . His eyes were like flames of fire , scorching her . He reached out and pulled her to her knees . " You 're even more lovely than I remembered . " Still on her knees , she came reluctantly to him as he drew her into his embrace . His hands slid carelessly under her gown and over her buttocks as he bent his head slowly to her , and trembling , Heather waited for his kiss . But before his lips pressed upon hers , he drew away the slightest degree and laughed softly in his mocking way . " You are more willing now , my love , than you were before . Does marriage make it so different ? Was that the price you were selling your body for ? And here I thought at last was a woman pure in heart who would willingly give her body to no man for a price , only for love . " " Oh , you horrible wretch ! " she cried angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say in the matter ? You will rape me as you did before , whether I struggle or not . " " Be quiet , " he said quickly , jerking her closer and forcing her to be still . " Do you want the others to hear and break down the door ? Lord Hampton is just waiting for the invitation . " " What do you care ? " she taunted viciously . " You are stronger than he . What will it matter if you have to throw him out before you finish your business with me ? " A muscle twitched in Brandon 's cheek and already Heather knew that slight movement meant danger . He glared down at her , his green eyes fierce and frigid . " I would n't assert my husbandly rights upon you tonight if you were the last woman in the world , " he sneered . Heather stopped struggling immediately and raised her eyes to his in surprise , wondering if she had heard him correctly . His eyelidsp82lowered and his jeering grin reappeared , showing startling white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You heard right , my dear . I have no intention of making love to you in this house tonight . " He ignored the expression of relief on her face and went on . " When I take my pleasure of you , my love , it will be in my own way , in my own house or on my own ship , and not where another man is waiting anxiously to barge in and pull us apart , and certainly not when that man is holding an axe over my head . " " An axe ? " she repeated innocently , relaxing against him . " Do n't tell me you do n't know . Surely you knew of their plan . I can not believe you were not in with them . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " she said cautiously . He laughed bitterly . " Always innocent , are n't you , sweet ? " His eyes dropped to her bosom and he ran his fingers over the side of her breast where the filmy gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Always innocent , " he said softly . " Always beautiful . Alwayscold . " She allowed his hands to caress her . They were gentle and as long as nothing would follow and he was her husband , she would not take the chance to stir his anger by refusing him this much . But she persisted with her questioning . She wanted to know what axe they had used . " How did they make you marry me ? " she inquired softly . His lips touched her hair and moved to her throat and Heather shivered involuntarily at their burning intensity . His hand stroked her breast still and seemed not to want to stop . Nervously she pulled away , fearing he would not keep his word . She reached and drew the bedcovers over her and sank down again in the middle of the bed " Are you going to tell me ? " she whispered , staring at him . His mood was again mocking , cruel , angry . " Why should I ? You 've heard it all before . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips I shall tell you . Your dear lordship was going to convict me of smugglingand selling arms to the French , despite the fact I 'm lily white . I would have been sent to prison , my ship taken from me , and God only knows what would have happened to my plantation back home . Very crafty of your friend , I must say . " He yanked off his coat and threw it into a chair and began untying his stock . " Do you know I am  --  or shall I say , I was engaged to be married when I returned home ? What am I supposed to tell her  --  my fiancke ? That I saw you and could n't help myself ? "  |p83He  paused a moment , pulling his shirt from his brown shoulders . He gazed at her angrily . " I do n't like being forced , my dear . It goes against my grain . If you had come to me when you first learned of your pregnancy , I would have helped you . I may have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired marriage with me , but to send your mighty friend and threaten me , it was a most unwise thing for such a little girl to do . " Wide-eyed and fearful , Heather huddled under the sheet as if it would give her protection from his savage hands if he turned on her . He moved about the room , blowing out candles and she watched him cautiously . He had stripped to the waist and did not appear to have any thought of stopping there . But for the moment he settled down in a chair by the bed . " You know you 're very beautiful , do n't you ? " he said , coldly appraisingher . " You could have had any man of your choosing , and yet you had to have me . I would like to know the truth , if you do n't mind . Did you perhaps learn that I have wealth ? " She looked at him strangely , seeing no need for him to ask . " I know nothing of your financial situation , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took my virginity . I could n't go to another man , sullied as I was and with your child in me . I would have given birth to a bastard before stooping so low . " " Your honorable nature is to be applauded , madam , " he said in a light , bantering tone , and his scoffing burned her . " Why should you have been allowed to go merrily upon your way and not made to right the wrong you did ? " she cried . He was beside her in an instant . " Please , my dear , " he said uneasily . " Refrain from raising your voice above a whisper or we 'll find ourselves with company . I have no desire to be thrown into prison by your Lord Hampton because he thinks I am mistreating you  --  especially since I 've already made you my wife . " His anxiety pleased her , but she went on in a hushed whisper . " You say you dislike force . Well , I loathe it , but I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now you 're angry because you 've had to pay the piper , yet you do not think of the child I carry  --  what it might have suffered , born a bastard . " " The child would have been well cared for and so would you have been . " She laughed ungraciously . " As your bastard and your mistress ? No , thank you . I 'd have slit my throat before consenting to that proposal . "  |p84The  tic in his cheek returned and he stared at her for such a long time she sat transfixed like a bird before a snake , then lids lowered slightly over mocking eyes . " A woman who is kept by a man is usually better tended than his wife . I would have been kind and more than generous with you . " " Meaning you will not be now , " she said with sarcasm . " Exactly , " he answered smoothly , heartlessly terrifying her . He got up from the bed and stared down at her . " As I 've said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've chosen a fitting punishment . You wanted security and a name for our child . You will have them , my dear  --  but you 'll not have one damned thing more . You 'll be hardly better than a servant in my home . You 'll have the name you wanted , but you 'll have to beg and plead to have me grant your slightest wish . You wo n't have any money nor will you lead a normal life , though I will be careful to save you the embarrassment of others knowing of your situation . In other words , my dear , the position you thought so honorable will be no more than your own special prison . You wo n't even share with me the more tender moments of marriage . You 'll be just another servant in my eyes . As my mistress you would have been treated as a queen , but you will now know me as master and nothing more . " " You mean we wo n't be  --  intimate ? " she asked with much surprise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need n't worry aboutme in that respect . I wont be cutting my own throat to spite my face . You 're only one woman among many , and for a man it is easy to find relief for his baser needs . " Heather sighed with the joy of the disburdened and smiled , gloating over her good fortune . " Sir , nothing could please me more , I assure you . He sneered at her coldly . " Yes , I can see that you 're pleased now . But your hell has only begun , m'lady . I 'm not termed a pleasant sort to live with . I have a foul temper which can snap up a small tart like you without a second notice . So be warned , my beauty . Do not tempt it . Tread lightly and perhaps you will survive . Do you understand ? " She nodded , no longer licking her lips over her blessings . " Now go to sleep . It will be some time before I 'm able to do thesame . " Quick to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she slid down into the bed with haste and drew the covers under her chin , watching him warily as he moved across the room to the balconydoors . He opened them and stepped out into the moonlight . Not tak/ing her eyes from him , Heather turned on her side carefully so she would not draw his attention back to her . Again he had taken up the stance of a sailor looking out to sea and the moon touched on his handsome face and broad shoulders . His smooth , brown skin gleamed in its light , and she drifted to sleep staring out at him . Heather awakened abruptly when Brandon tell back on the pillow beside her , and drugged with sleep , she thought he would do some harm to her . She sat up with a startled cry on her lips and flung up an arm as if to ward him off . But he caught it with a snarl and jerked her back to her pillow . " Be quiet , you little fool ! " he growled , leaning over her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair and leaving you the bed . " A tremor of fright passed through her body as he held her down . He was just above her in the darkness and his warm breath touched her face . The moonlight streaming in from the balcony etched his angry profile . " I did n't mean to cry out , " she whispered fearfully . " I was just startled . " " For God 's sake , be startled some other time , " he snapped . " I have an aversion to prisons . " " Lord Hampton would n't  --  " she began softly . " The hell he would n't ! Now that you have my name , your honor is restored , but if he thought he acted unwisely in giving you to me , he would go ahead with his threat and toss me into prison just to keep me from you . So despite what you feel about me , if you want our child to grow up with a father , please do n't offer him any encouragement . " I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could n't have proved it by me , " he retorted . " Oh , you ! " she hissed , trying to struggle free from his grasp . " Whywas I so unlucky to be put upon by you ! You 're  --  you 're abominable ! " He laughed softly as he held her down . " Some women wouldn'tagree with you , my dear . " " Oh , you cad ! " she panted breathlessly . " You vile , uncouth , loathsomerapist  --  defiler of women ! I loathe and detest you . " He caught her to him , his lean , hard body immensely threatening to her small frame , and gave her a quick , silencing , bone-breaking squeeze . " Be careful , my beauty , or you will find yourself with your hands full . I can stop your screams quite easily . It will not discomfort me in the least to act the husband . "  |p86She  gasped with pain as his grip tightened again , and Heather thought she would be crushed in his brutal arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs and realized that she was the only one even partially clothed . But the gown was little comfort . It was wound around her waist and bared a breast whose fullness was now crushed to his chest . There was no question to his desires . " Please , " she whimpered as his hold became more harrowing . " I will be good . Do not hurt me so . " His deep chuckle made a shiver of fright pass through her body as he continued to hold her , then quite suddenly he released her and dropped her back to the pillow . " Go to sleep . I wo n't bother you . " She drew the covers under her chin with quivering fingers and curled on her side facing him , shaking uncontrollably . The moonlight made the room bright and she saw that his eyes were open and he lay flat on his back with his hands under his head , staring up at the ceiling . Even in the dimness of the room she thought she saw his cheek vibrate with rage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long while later . He sighed heavily . " Charleston of the Carolinas . " " Is it very beautiful there ? " she ventured again . " To me it is . You may not like it , " he replied stiffly . She dared not ask more of what was to be her home . She had braved enough as it was . A chilling breeze came through the opened balcony doors and woke her at the first break of dawn . At just awakening , she was out of sorts , not being able to recognize her surroundings . But she soon became aware of the man she pressed to for warmth . Her left hand lay across his chest over the crisp , dark hair covering it , and her cheek rested against his sturdy shoulder . He slept soundly , his face turned slightly toward her , relaxed in slumber . Not moving for fear of awakening him , she studied him at her leisure . Her eyes traced the firm , straight mouth , now softened with sleep , and the long , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome man , " she thought . " Perhaps it would not be so bad to have a son like him . " He stirred slightly and turned his face away , leaving her to stare at the back of his rumpled head and the broad expanse of his chest where her hand lay . She gazed at the ring on her third finger and marveled at the brightness of the gold . It looked strange on her hand and what was even more odd was the way she suddenly felt . The thought of beingp87this man 's wife seeped through with new realization . It was something he had said the day before  --  forever and for always she would be his . And now she mused : " Even in eternity I will belong to him . " Very slowly and carefully , so as not to awaken him , she drew the covers on his chest , but she soon realized her mistake with thinking him chilled . It did n't take long for him to kick the covers away completely , making her blush profusely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not turn away though her face flamed with her own temerity . Instead she let her eyes roam over him slowly and with much interest , satisfying her curiosity . There was no need of others to tell her what she could see herself  --  that he was magnificently made , like some wild , grand beast of the forests . Long , flexible muscles were superbly conditioned , his belly flat and hard , his hips narrow . Her hand , slim and white , appeared out of place upon his brown and hairy chest . Disturbed by the strange stirring within her , she eased from him and moved toward her side of the bed . She turned away , trying not to think how her eyes had lingered on his body , and she saw a leaf fall to the floor of the balcony . She huddled under the covers , wishing she were as warm-blooded as the man beside her . The mantel clock had long before struck nine chimes when the two giggly girls returned to dress her . They rapped on the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It maddened her and brought a bright flush of color to her face as she slid from the bed . She glanced back over her shoulder at her husband and found him still asleep and undraped . Very cautiously she went around the bed and pulled the sheet up carefully over his nakedness . He awakened instantly , startling her so much she jumped . She drew back her hands as if she had just touched fire and went a few shades redder as his gaze swept her , making her extremely conscious of the filmy garment she wore and of its even more revealing slits . A slow , amused smile curved his lips and made her tremble , and she turned uncertainly and went to the door , knowing his eyes followed her . The two twittering , sniggering maids came in together , one carrying a tray of food . They glanced about the room curiously as though they expected to see some secrets of the night before unfolded in front of their eyes . Seeing Brandon propping himself up on the pillows with only a sheet drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggles . He chuckled with amusement at their nervousness , but Heather desired greatly to give each a pinch , especially when they kept right on staring at her husband with such a hungry look in their eyes , givingp88her to wonder if they were so chaste as their fidgeting implied . They went together to the bedside to show him the great assortment of food on the tray , and Heather waited impatiently as they cooed over him , spreading a napkin over his lap with maddening slowness and pouring him tea . In the midst of all this , his eyes lifted to her own bright , angry face and mocked her , and she turned away smoldering . Finally the maidservants remembered their duties and returned to attend her , preparing a rose-scented bath and laying out her bridal gown again , it being the only gown she possessed . Under the interested and observing eyes of her husband , they stripped the blue veil from her and helped her into the bath . Their giggling did not cease as they scrubbed her back and arms , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not endure it any longer . She snatched the sponge and soap from their hands impatiently and snapped at them to leave her be . She immediately regretted not being more tolerant when Brandon laughed at her with mirth , throwing his splendid head up high with his glee . She glowered at him , feeling intense hatred rise up once more within her . But she did not dare hiss the words at him she wished to , fearing he would silence her again with his fierce , heartless hands . Besides , she would not give the two skinny , homely girls the satisfaction of knowing she and the handsome beast were anything but newly wedded and in love . Rising from the tub in shimmery wet splendor , she allowed them once more to assist her , standing motionless as they patted her body dry under Brandon 's unrelenting gaze . He watched with such a slow , unhurried regard that her skin burned from its intensity . She was more than willing to don her shift though its transparency and immodestdecolletage were hardly very comforting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as fidgety as the young girls , and she cursed herself silently for allowing Brandon 's appraisal to make her nervous . But it was almost more than she could bear to have him lounging back against the satin pillows watching her , and the two servants seemed to take forever doing her hair . When they stepped back to compliment each other on their artistry , she breathed a sigh of relief . But her short lived comfort came to an abrupt end when Brandonswung his long legs over the side of the bed and stood up , draggingthe sheet with him . He managed deftly to wrap it around him without revealing more of himself to the girls , and he came to her , holding the sheet around his narrow hips . He dropped a kiss on one round breast just above the lace of her shift . " A rewarding experience , my love , " he murmured easily . " I mustp89admit I 've never had the honor before of being present at a lady 's toilette . " For a moment their eyes met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous and uncertain . But under his openly admiring regard , she flushed crimson and dropped her eyes to her lap , still feeling the brush of his lips upon her breast and the strange tremor which they had evoked . She heard his soft laugh and then he turned and made a show of kissing each maid 's hand , and he might as well have been fully garmented the way he acted . He was completely at ease and terribly confident of himself . " You truly have done well , my ladies , " he purred to them . " My wife is greatly appreciative . " The two almost swooned , never having such a thing happen to them before and certainly never by such a fine specimen of a man . They fell against each other giggling unceasingly and ran to ready his bath . When they finally left the room , Heather sprang up from the bench and flounced angrily to the bed for her dress . " What need was there for that ? " she snapped . " They should have been severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragedthem to be worse . " He smiled slowly , his gaze moving appreciatively over her back . " I 'm sorry , my love . I was n't aware that you were so jealous . " Her blue eyes flashing , Heather spun around in a rage , prepared to send a string of insults flying at his head , but Brandon only laughed and dropped the sheet to the floor . " Attend to my bath , will you , sweet ? I have trouble reaching my back. , ' She could do nothing but splutter and spew and turn a bright red . His odious manner riled her blood to the boiling point . Yet as he was , standing unclothed before her and daring her to speak with amused patience , she had to back down . She could not stand and curse him for the wretch he was , when both of them were conscious first of all of his nakedness . He waited for her answer in a relaxed stance , hands on hips , one knee bent and slightly forward . She hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not call him names . Holding her teeth clenched tight , she brushed past him and picked up the sponge and soap and waited for him to get in the tub , her back as rigid as stone . She heard his amused chuckle and she gritted her teeth more . Then he was easing into the tub of hot water in front of her . She hesitated but a moment over his back , then with frigid determi/nation she bent over him and began to lather the soap over it . She scrubbed hard , venting her anger into the strokes she used . But when she had gladly concluded that task , he just grinned . " You 're not finished , pet . I would like to be washed all over . " " All over ? " she squeaked weakly , incredulously . " Of course , sweet . I 'm very lazy . " She damned him with unuttered words , knowing he was making her bathe him because it satisfied his need for vengeance . His excuse of being lazy was meant only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that having to touch him in any way was agony for her , and he had chosen the intimate chore of bathing him as punishment . She 'd have gladly taken a beating rather than to do it and he knew this well . Despising him , she jerked up the sponge again and bent to her task as he leaned back in the tub . She ran the soap through the mat of hair on his chest and over his broad shoulders , her face burning under his casual scrutiny . His unflinching stare caressed her white arms , the long , slender neck , and finally her bosom whose beauty was revealed even more as she worked over him , exposing part of one round breast . " Did you have someone you were fond of in your uncle 's village ? " he asked suddenly , a frown wrinkling his brow . " No , " she said sharply , then rebuked herself for not being more cunning . The frown vanished . He ran a wet finger across her breasts and smiled . " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angrily she snatched her shift up high over her bosom and rubbed it against her flesh where the water trickled down between her breasts . When she let go again , the garment returned to its place , now quite damp . " There were a few , but you need n't worry . They were n't like you . They were gentlemen . " " I 'm not worried at all , my pet , " he answered easily . " You were well guarded . " " Yes , " she retorted sarcastically . " That is , from everybody but you . He chuckled and swept her again with his burning gaze . " It was my pleasure , sweet . " She went livid with rage . " I suppose it pleases your male ego too , tohave me breeding now ! You must surely be proud of yourself ! " His grin was mocking . " I 'm not displeased . I happen to like babies . " " Oh , you  --  you  --  " she sputtered , seething.  |p91The  grin was gone with frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , " he said sarcastically . She choked off a sob and squeezed the sponge out over his knee . There was nothing left to wash now but the lower half of his body , and she could not bring herself to be that familiar with him . Tears sparkled in her long lashes and fell from her cheeks . " I ca n't , " she murmured . He reached under her chin and lifted it up gently . His gaze went deep into her eyes . " If I choose , you know you will do it , do n't you ? " he asked softly . She closed her eyes in agony and nodded her head . " Yes , " she whisperedmiserably , tears falling freely now . His hand caressed her fragile cheek . " Gather my clothes then , will you , sweet ? I 'm sure everyone is waiting to see how you have fared . " She went gladly and collected his clothes from about the room , more than grateful because he had been lenient with her . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names again or flare up in anger at him . She would have to remember he disliked insolence and would not stand for it . She had been effectively disciplined and would do his will as an obedient wife . Cowardly she was , and she had n't the nerve to do anything else . When they left the bedroom , she walked beside him silently , completelydocile . She even managed a timid smile when he slid his hand behind her back to her waist and glanced down at her . In the drawing room the two older couples waited anxiously , though Aunt Fanny for an entirely different reason . She was hoping for the worst , but she frowned blackly as her niece came in seeming at ease with the man beside her . His lordship went to Heather immediatelyand embraced her . " You 're looking radiant as always , my child , " he said with relief in his voice . " Did you expect anything else , my Lord ? " Brandon asked coldly . Lord Hampton laughed softly . " Do not hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather 's happiness comes first . " " Yes , you 've made that abundantly clear . Now , will I be allowed to take her to my ship today or must we again have your hospitality forced upon us ? " In good spirits , his lordship was not easily vexed . " By all means , take her with my good blessings . But first , would you be opposed to eating the noon meal with us ? It 's not a command , but an invitation . Ifp92you 're not so inclined , we will understand . It 's just that we hate to see Heather go . She 's like our own child . " " I suppose it will do no harm to stay , " Brandon answered stiffly . " But I must get back to my ship soon after . I 've been away too long as it is . " " Of course . Of course . We understand . But I desired to talk with you about Heather 's dowry . We are prepared to settle the matter our-selves  --  generously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His reply drew shocked attention and most of all from Heather . His lordship stared at the Yankee captain for a moment , completely baffled . " Did I hear you correctly , sir ? " " You did , " Brandon said formally . " I have no intentions of taking payment for marrying my wife . " " But it 's expected ! I mean a woman should bring to her husband some form of dowry . I am more than willing  --  " " The dowry she will bring is the child she is carrying , nothing more . I 'm quite capable of taking care of my own without gifts . Just the same , thank you for the offer . " Heather closed her mouth and moved to sit down , feeling more than stunned . " Crazy Yankee , " Aunt Fanny muttered . Brandon clicked his heels together and bowed formally before her . " From you , madam , that is truly a compliment . " She glared at him and made as if to sneer an insult but thoughtbetter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped her mouthshut and jerked her face away from his mocking gaze . " As you are well aware , madam , " he said to her back , " what I say is true . I do take care of my own  --  and their debts . " The meaning of what he said was lost upon Heather , but FannySimmons grew very pale and very nervous . She refused to look at him . She was still silent when a servant came to announce that luncheonwas served.  |p93A  cold October thunderstorm had washed the autumn air and left the day with occasional squalls chasing themselves across London . The wheels clattered over the cobblestones and splashed through mud holes as the landau lurched and jolted its way toward the docks . Heather sat quietly by Lady Hampton in the rear seat . The woman spoke softly to her and now and then smoothed a glossy black curl lovingly , or lightly touched her hand . It was the only indication of nervousness displayed despite the sorrow of the approaching moment . But often Heather 's eyes were drawn hesitantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Hampton across from her . He was braced in the corner against the bumps and his eyes moved slowly and impassively about the carriage , falling on her for a moment then slidingaway with the same ease with which they had touched her . Lord Hampton made sporadic attempts to engage him in conversation , but was rewarded with brief , noncommittal answers uttered only for the sake of politeness . The carriage made a careening turn and swept down a narrow waterfrontstreet , crossed an open muddy court , and drew up in the lee of a building . A small sign rattled and clapped above a door , labeling thestructure : Charleston Enterprises Warehouse . Brandon stepped lightly from the carriage and turned to Heather . " You 'll have several moments to say your farewells . I must have the warehouse agent signal my ship for a lighter . " With this he strode away , the wind ruffling his close-cropped hair and the lace at his cuffs . Heather 's gaze followed him into the building , then she slowly turned to Lady Hampton and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer be withheld . She fell into the woman 's arms and through their tears their hearts communed  --  a motherless girl , a childless woman . Lord Hamp/ton rather hoarsely cleared his throat . It was a brief moment 's passing before Heather sat upright again and he took her hand into his . " Rest easy , child , " he comforted . " It is the way of the world that few partings are forever . Who knows when our paths may meet once more and we might share another moment of life . Take care , my child . Take very special care . " Impulsively Heather hugged his neck and brushed his leathery cheek with her lips . " Wo n't you please come and see me again before we sail ? " she pleaded . " No , we must n't , Heather . Your husband 's ire has been strained enough . It 's best we bid farewell here . Perhaps he will later forgive us , but for now , God speed , my very own . " She threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both , " she gasped , tears flowing freely . Her ladyship clasped the girl firmly to her . " You will have your husband , my love , and soon a child . You 'll have precious little time to think of us . But something tells me you 'll be happier with him than you were here . Now go , my dear . Go seek your angry man . And Heather  --  remember that anger and love are but a whit apart . " Reluctantly Heather drew from Lady Hampton 's embrace and moved to the door of the landau . She heard her husband 's voice just outside as he spoke briskly to a lounging tar , and she realized he had returned and was now standing by the horses waiting for her . Brushingthe tears from her face , she opened the door and lifted her skirts to descend from the carriage . Brandon hurried to assist her and slid his hands to her waist . Their eyes met , and for once , thankfully , he did not mock her tears . He lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Hampton handed him their cloaks and the small bundle of gifts from Lady Hampton . She moved away as he spoke in a low voice to the Hamptons . The Fleetwood stood out in open harbor several hundred yards from the dock awaiting her turn at loading . Just pulling around the bow , a whaleboat skimmed toward them , four deckhands straining at the oars . A small , elderly , somewhat agitated man stood in the stern , urging them on , no doubt with colorful phrases . Closer around her the dock was alive in a chaos of sound , sight and smell . Idle sailors loafed about with the stench of the prior evening 's revelries still upon them , and drab , unwashed strumpets quite boldly hawked their wares , hoping to make a shilling or two or an evening 's bed and board . A group of rats squealed stridently over garbage in the open gutter , then fled as a rock flung by an urchin thumped amongp95them . Shrill laughter rang as several unwashed ragamuffins skittered across the dock , leaped over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering how she had thought of giving birth to a bastard and letting him grow up knowing this life of the streets . At least now the child would have an existence above this . What did it matter that she was neither loved nor wanted as a wife ? Her child would have a father and something of a home despite having a sire who sailed the sea . This was the life of a merchant captain this squalid , filthy scene around her and that small ship yonder . What part she would play in her husband 's life she did not know as yet , only that she would be the mother of his child . Whether he took her with him on other voyages in the future or left her conveniently behind was his decision and one in which she would have little or no say . But as she faced the wind that brought the scent of the sea to her nostrils , so she must face life  --  head on , taking whatever small pleasure her husband allowed her and being content . In time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed her by . At the touch of her husband 's hand on her back , Heather 's thoughts fled swiftly . He had come with a noiseless tread , startling her . Feeling her slight body quiver , Brandon drew his cloak over her shoulders . " We must go now and meet the boat , " he murmured . Taking her arm , he guided her through stacks of cargo , coiled ropes and nets as the whaleboat approached the end of the pier . When the craft first touched the dock , the small man leaped ashore and scurried to meet them . He snatched the round stock cap from his head , and Heather realized with a start that it was George , her husband 's cabin boy and manservant . The man bowed in a jerky manner and addressed his master . " We thought you were to come back yesterday , cap'n . We almost give you up for lost . I was about to form up the hands and beat through the city for you thinkin ' you 'd fallen ill to the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap'n . " And with a bob and hardly a pause . " Hello , MUM . " " We were detained at Lord Hampton 's for a bit , " Brandon replied . With a nod and another jerky bob , George resettled his hat over his shiny pate , relieved his captain of the bundles and walked behind as they proceeded to the boat . Brandon descended first to the craft , then swung his young bride down beside him and settled her in the bow.  |p96George  tossed him the bundles and painter , slid down the ladder , assumed his place in the stern and set the tiller . " Look lively , mates , " he demanded . " We 're under way now . Push off . Port oars awash , not stroke , lads  --  stroke  --  stroke . Now both and bend your backs to it , lads . ' Twill be a cold enough journey for the mum yet we drag it out . So hump , laddies , make it good . " The small craft slid beneath the stern of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleetwood . There was a light chop rolling before the breeze and a chill spray of water struck Heather'sface , snatching her breath and sending a cold shiver through her . She pulled Brandon 's cloak tightly about her and huddled deeper into its warm folds . Any comfort was short lived , however , for the elementscombined in a concerted effort to effect renewed discomfort . The whaleboat 's prow broke the back of each wave , swung high then slid down into the trough . The unaccustomed motion upset Heather 's stomach , and each new plunge seemed to raise her gorge a bit higher . She cast an uneasy glance to her husband who sat with his face into the wind , seeming to enjoy the feel of the salt spray , and pressed her hand to the base of her throat . " If I retch now , I 'll hate myself forever , " she thought wildly . Her knuckles grew white but her face gradually assumed the greenishshade of the sea . Her battle was nearly won , yet as they drew near the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurching back and forth above her in direct opposition to the motions she felt . A miserable groan escaped her lips at the confusion of movement and drew Brandon 's immediate attention . He looked for one brief moment at the pale , distressed face and the slender hand struggling for control and acted swiftly . Sliding his arm around in front of her , he lowered her head carefully over the gunwale and let nature resolve itself in the sea . A few moments later Heather gave a last shudder and straightened , loathing herself . Shamed and humiliated , she dared not raise her eyes . Beside her , Brandon wet a handkerchief and pressed it to her brow . " Are you feeling better now ? " he asked gently . The motion had died away and the craft now stood in the lee of the ship . She managed a weak nod as George eased the boat against the curved belly of the barque . As Brandon secured the bow painter on the chains the older man did likewise aft . The captain then braced his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come , ma petite , I 'll help you aboard . " She came cautiously and made to set her foot on the ladder besidep97his . His arm went about her and , taking her slight weight against him , he climbed up to the deck of his ship . He set her down and for a moment his attention returned to the whaleboat , leaving Heather to gaze about . She found herself standing at the bottom of a seemingly confused tangle of ropes , cables and spars , and through them all , the great , raked masts lunged skyward , now swaying with a soft , gentle rhythm against the clouds . From the bowels of the ship came an almostmusical squeaking , creaking and groaning . The tempo of sound and motion matched and almost made the ship a living , breathing thing beneath her . It had a clean , salty smell , and as she looked she realized each item was neatly in its place , ropes coiled at hand , pins and buckets stowed . A sense of order lay about the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to change your gown , Heather . I purchased a few things for you before I found you had disappeared . They 're in my cabin . " And with a mocking eyebrow raised , he added , " I believe you know the way . " She blushed profusely and glanced hesitantly toward one of the doors beneath the quarter-deck . " Yes , I can see that you do , " he murmured , watching her . " You will find the clothes in my trunk . I will be along in a moment . " So dismissed , she moved away from him to the door . Before she opened it , however , her gaze went back for one brief moment to her husband and found him deep in conversation with George . It seemed he had already forgotten her . The cabin was as she remembered it , compact and small , occupying as little of the precious cargo space as possible . The day 's dreariness made it a deep twilight within as only soft hazy light came from the windows at the stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle on the table and hung her husband 's cloak on a peg by the door . Then she knelt before the trunk and her fingers touched the latch and lifted the lid . A startled gasp escaped her as she saw the beige gown neatly folded on top . Memories came flooding back , reminding her of William Court and of the night spent in this very cabin . Her eyes were drawn reluctantly to the bunk where she had lost her virginity and she gazed at it for a moment , remembering the struggles that had taken place there , the passionate and fiery lips against her flesh , and lastly of the defeat . Her hand slid to her belly with a will of its own and her face burned . She started when the door behind her opened and Brandon walked in . Hastily she pushed the beige dress aside and pulled out a deep redp98velvet gown that was beneath . It possessed a neckline cut low , and sleeves , fitted and long , trimmed with white lace at the wrists . It was a gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its simplicity and beauty . As Brandon pulled his coat off and threw it on the bunk , she rose and began unfastening her gown with trembling fingers . She stepped out of it carefully and put it away in the trunk . " There 's an inn nearby , " said her husband behind her . " It will be more comfortable for you there than it is here . " A small frown touched her brow as she turned and looked at him . He had unbuttoned his shirt and was already engrossed in his ledgers at his desk . As easily as he dismissed her from his ship could he dismiss her from his mind . Perhaps he would even leave her behind when he sailed . There was no guarantee that he would not , and she would be left destitute . " I am not unaccustomed to discomfort , she replied in a soft voice . " I will be content to stay here . You need not take me to an inn . " He glanced up at her . " You are very agreeable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scornful laugh . " But it is I who make the decisions here . The inn will be more suitable to your needs . " She had not thought of this , that he would so cruelly leave her behind . She felt a coldness begin to grow in the depth of her body . " Is this truly to be my fate ? " she wondered forlornly . " To be left on the waterfront to fare as I might in childbirth at the hands of midwiveswho know nothing more than filth and squalor ? Is my son to have a name and still to live his life as an urchin in a gutter ? " Sheturned and a shiver of apprehension went through her . Was there no mercy in this man ? If he wanted her to beg , she would gladly go down on her knees before him and plead for her child 's life . But he did not seem to want that . He had made up his mind coldly and without emotion . She was to go to an inn . Trying to calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders and went to where he sat . His attention fell on her and a strange expression crossed his face . The deep rich color of the gown had darkenedher eyes until they appeared as midnight blue , and the flawlessI ' ' I skin shone startling white against the red . Her bosom was generously and beautifully displayed , the gown barely covering the pinkness at its peaks . Terribly afraid and unsure of how he would react to doing this small labor for her , Heather turned her back to him.  | " I 'm not able to fasten it , " she murmured softly as her stomach fluttered and her consternation grew . " Do you mind ? " She felt his fingers on the back of the gown , and she bent her head forward and waited , scarcely breathing , until he finished , then she moved away , casting an uncertain glance over her shoulder at him as she did . He was again studying the books , but now there was a black scowl on his face . As she went quietly about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes she would need at the inn , and hanging his discarded coat on a peg inside his locker , she eyed him covertly , fearingthat she would do some small thing to irritate him , but he seemed absorbed in his books and oblivious to her . The time dragged slowly and silently by . There was only a moment'srespite when George brought coffee and tea . But he served his captain with hardly a murmur and brought the tea to her where she sat in the gallery behind her husband 's chair . Then the servant was gone again , leaving her to listen to the gentle sighing of the ship and the dull thud of her heart . The time was nearly ten of the hour when Brandon pushed his chair from the desk and looked at her once more . His eyes dropped to her bosom and he frowned again . " You had better wear my cloak to the inn , " he said brusquely . " I have no desire to be waylaid once we 're ashore by some petty whoremongerwho thinks you 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather 's face and her eyes fell from his gaze . She murmured an obedient answer , slid from the cushions and brushed past him to get the cloak . A few moments later they were in the boat waiting for George to descend . The servant dropped her bundle and a duffel bag to the boat , then climbed down and gave orders to the sailors to push off . On shore he walked behind them , looking cautiously over his shoulders for would-be thieves or other dangerous characters . They arrived at the inn without incident and entered to the strains of a melancholy tune a sailor was singing . The man was small and thinly fleshed , but his voice was a full baritone of gentle touch . Near him , a few men sat quaffing ale and listening , enthralled by the magic of his voice . A fire crackled in the hearth and an aroma of roast pig rose into the air , making Heather 's mouth water . She closed her eyes and tried not to think of the hunger that gnawed at her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off quickly to talk with the innkeeper as Heather followed her husband top100a table in the corner . She slid into the chair he held for her , and a moment later they were being served food and drink which Heather accepted gratefully as her stomach growled for nourishment . She did not notice the stares she drew from the men nor the cloak slipping away from her shoulders nor two seedy-looking men who sat across the room from them talking in low whispers to one another . Her attention was divided between her food and listening to the song of " Greensleeves " the tar was singing . With a start she felt her husbandlean over her . He drew the cloak again over her shoulders and her face flamed as she lifted her eyes to his . " I bought the gown for my private admiration , my love , " he saidsoftly . " I did n't mean to have you pleasure other men with the sight ofyour lovely bosom . It is not wise to do so either . You are causing a stiramong these men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she realized what he said was true . She seemed the center of attention . Even the sailor had stopped singing for a moment as he gazed at her . Shortly he began again . Black is the color of my true love 's hair Her looks are something wondrous fair , The purest eyes and the softest hands I love the grass on where she standsI love my love and well she knows , I love the grass on where she goes . If she on earth no more could stayMy life would quickly pass away . Heather glanced at her husband and saw that he was irritated withthe sailor 's song . His eyelids had lowered over his eyes as he attended his meal , but in his cheek a small muscle twitched . As before , she grew silent and fearful when she sensed his anger . After dinner , the innkeeper showed them to the room for which George had made arrangements . The servant carried the bundles in , then removed himself with the innkeeper . For a few moments Heather waited for Brandon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lounged in a chair and seemed in no hurry to go , so she went to him and had him unfasten her gown , and she began to undress as if she expected him to stay . She took down her hair and ran her fingers through it to smooth the curls because she possessed no brush or comb . Aware of her husband 's eyes on her , she slipped out of herp101gown and shift and laid them over a chair and donned a nightdress Lady Hampton had given her . The gown was of a thin white batiste with inserts of lace over the bosom , and a neckline cut round and very low . Beneath the breasts a narrow ribbon was drawn through lace and tied . The sleeves were full and long and a ruffle edged with lace fell over her hands . Though less filmy than the gown of her wedding night , this one , like the other , was meant to give a man pleasure , but as she moved in front of a candle 's glow , it brought an angry oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to see him striding toward the door . " I 'll be back in an hour or two , " he growled , opening the door . Then he was gone and Heather sank to the floor as tearful , frightened sobs choked her . " He can not even speak the truth , " she gasped . " He will never re-turn . " Each moment then that passed was longer than the one before . She paced the floor , wondering what she was to do and where she was to go . She could not go again to her aunt 's and allow her child to grow up under the woman 's hateful hand , nor could she go to Lord Hamptonand ask him to help her . She had too much pride to cast her troubles upon them again . Perhaps if life were merciful she would find work as a maid here at the inn . She would ask tomorrow , but for the night she would sleep if she could . The night aged and try though Heather may to calm her fears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed an eternity had passed when she heard a bell toll the hour of one . With a cry she jumped from the bed and ran to the window to slam it closed . She dropped her head against its frame and her slender shoulders shook with sobs . Just outside her door she heard a man 's voice and another in reply . Her fear doubled , and when the door opened , the color drained from her face . But the light in the hall touched on George 's face and silhouetted her husband 's tall , broad-shouldered frame . " You came back ! " she breathed . His face turned her way before he closed the door and they were again lost in blackness . " Why are n't you in bed ? " he asked , moving in the darkness toward the bed . There was a scratch of flint and steel . The tinder caught and he lit a candle on the table then looked at her . " Are you ill ? " She came toward him from the shadows and the candlelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you had left me , " she murmured . " I thought I would never see you again . "  |p102For  a moment he gazed at her with some surprise , then he smiled gently and drew her near . " And you were frightened ? " She nodded her head piteously and tried to choke back a sob but itended sounding like a hoarse croak . He brushed her hair from her face tenderly and touched his lips to her brow to quiet her trembling . " You were never alone , ma petite . George was outside the door all the time , guarding it . He 's just now gone to get some sleep , but do you think me the cad to leave you , not assured of your safety ? " I did n't know what to believe , " she whispered . " I feared you would never come back . " " MY God ! You are not very complimentary to me  --  nor to yourself . I would not leave a lady to her own defense in such a place and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if it will calm your fears , I 'll not leave you again while we 're here . " She lifted her eyes to his and saw a kindly warmth in them . " No , there is no need , " she murmured . " I 'll not be frightened again . " He cupped her chin in his hand . " Then let us go to bed . The day has been long and I am tired . " Wiping the tears from her cheeks , she climbed into bed on the side nearest the door and watched him quietly as he opened the bundle George had carried in with her own . Her eyes widened as he took out the box of Flintlock pistols with which she had once threatened the servant . He brought it with him to the bed where she lay , and droppingdown beside her , took out the pistols and began to load them . " Do you expect trouble ? " she questioned softly , sitting up . He glanced at her and smiled . " It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things around me . You need n't worry , my love . " She watched curiously as he loaded one , remembering her own distresswhen she had tried to determine how and had not been able to . Seeing her interest , Brandon laughed softly . " Do you wish now to learn how to load these ? " he asked , smiling . " You do very well as it is with them empty . George was quite embarrassedwhen he found that you had tricked him . The fact that a mere wisp of femininity had made him quake with fright before an empty gun injured his pride . He was impossible for some time after . So was I for that matter , " he added gruffly , remembering the way he had viciouslyhurled a string of oaths at the servant when he had returned to the Fleetwood and found the girl gone . His disposition had not improvedany when he also found that she had disappeared without a trace.  |p103He  took her arm and pulled her to the edge of the bed beside him . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how a pistol is loaded , I will teach you . " Then he looked into her eyes and warned , " But do n't ever make the mistake of thinking you can turn these on me and not use them . I am not George and you would have to kill me before you could escape . " He laughed again softly . " And as for that , I doubt that you have it in you to kill a man , so I think I would be safe in taking these from you . " Heather swallowed hard . She stared up at him silently , with eyes round as moons . She believed every word he said . He was not one to make idle threats . They sat very close together on the edge of the bed , so close their bodies touched  --  her thigh against his , her arm pressed to his side . His arm was braced behind her , his hand resting on the bed very near her buttocks . Her composure was sorely strained . Nervously she dropped her gaze and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knees , realizing it had slid up almost to her hips when he pulled her to him . " May I try to load this one , " she asked , hesitantly touching the pistol he held in his other hand . " If you wish , " he replied , handing it to her . The Flintlock was heavy and meant for a man 's hand . She found it uncomfortable in hers . Laying it across her knees , she took up the powder horn and lifted the muzzle of the pistol to pour the gun powderdown it . " Turn it away from your face , " Brandon directed . She obeyed and poured a small amount of the gray powder into the muzzle . As she had seen him do , she stuffed a piece of paper in and with the rod rammed it down the barrel , then wrapped a lead ball in a patch of oiled cloth and pushed it down the muzzle also . It was done . " You learn very quickly , " Brandon murmured as he took the pistol from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps you will be another Molly Pitcher . " Glancing up at him , she frowned slightly . " Who is she , Brandon ? " she asked softly , not realizing that she had spoken his name for the first time . He smiled and reached up to touch one of her glossy curls . " It was a name given to women who helped carry water to American soldiers in battle and to one woman in particular who helped to hold the line against the British at Monmouth . "  | " But you are English too , Brandon , are you not ? " she asked , gazing up at him with curious eyes . He laughed , " Indeed no , madam . I 'm an American . My family came from here , it is true , but long before they died they considered themselves loyal Americans . My father helped fight the British and as a boy so did I. You will have to get used to the idea that your beloved England is not so beloved where we 're going . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much astonishment . " You sail here and do business with the people you once fought . " He shrugged his shoulders . " I am a man of business . I sell my cotton and goods to the English for a profit . They sell me what my people will buy for more profit . I never hold grudges if I think it will interfere with the business of making money . Besides , I do a service for my country in bringing back the things that are needed and are not yet obtainable . " " Do you come here every year then ? " " I have been for the last ten years , but this will be my last year . I have a plantation to run . I ca n't neglect it any longer . And now I have other responsibilities on the way . I 'll be selling the Fleetwood when I get home . " Something caught at Heather 's heart . Was it possible he meant never to sail again , to settle down and be a father to their child ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his household . The very thought flooded her being with warmth and she almost relaxed against him . But cold reality and doubt chilled the dream . " Will I live on your plantation too ? " she asked , almost fearing the answer . " Of course , " he replied , rather amazed at her question . " Where did you think you would live ? " She shrugged her shoulders nervously . " I  --  I did n't know . You did n't say . " He chuckled . " So now you know . Now do be a good girl and get into bed and go to sleep . Your chattering has worn me out . " She crawled into bed again as he stood up and began to undress . When he had stripped , he motioned her across the bed . " It 's best I sleep nearest the door , " he said . She quickly moved to the other side of the bed and did not ask why she must . It was clear he expected something to happen . He blew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern hung aglow in the courtyard below and in the gusty evening breeze , cast its bouncing shadows dimly into the room . To her dismay ,  |p105Heather  found that her hair was streaming across Brandon 's pillow and was caught beneath him . She waited for him to free her , but a long time passed and he did not and then she knew he would not for he had fallen asleep with his cheek against her soft curls . With a sigh of resignation , she settled herself to pass the night in bondage , but with his presence close beside her , she found security and she sank into the nether realms of slumber . From the depths of sleep she struggled with terror 's spurs goading her to full awareness . A hand pressed tightly over her mouth , smothering screams bred of panic . Her eyes flew open and in frenzied reaction she clawed at the hand . Then her husband 's face loomed up close above hers in the darkness , and with senses returning , her fear passed and she sank back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes wide and searching . " Lie still , " he whispered softly . " Do n't move . Do n't make a sound . Pretend to be asleep . " She nodded her head to let him know she would obey . His hand slid away and he sank down again beside her . His breath came slow and even , as if he were asleep , and from beyond the door she could hear a muffled voice and an odd picking and scratching at the door itself . The bar slowly began to lift , and she struggled to control her own breathing . With the fluttering in her chest it was no easy task . A dim thread of light appeared and grew wider as the door swung open . Through slitted eyes she watched and saw a head appear . She heard a whisper . " They 're asleep . Come on . " Two dark figures stole into the room , and the door was pushed shut . Heather gritted her teeth as the men moved forward and almost jumped when the floor creaked beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wake the bloke , you fool , or we may not get the girl . He 's not a wee one . " " She 's across the bed , " the other whispered a little louder . " Sh-sh , " the first hissed , " Do n't you ken , I kin see that with me own two eyes . " They approached almost to the foot of the bed when Brandon snaked the pistols from beneath the sheets and sat up . " Hold your pace , lads , " he demanded . " You 've been found out . And do stand very still for these worthy pieces have two leaden balls to hole your hides . "  |p106The  two froze in mid stride , one half turned as if to flee with the other holding his companion 's arm . " Heather , light the candle that we might set faces to our midnight visitors , " Brandon urged . She crawled behind him quickly and lit the candle on the commode . The glow of its flame spread over the room softly and touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same two who had huddled across the room from them at mealtime . " We meant no real ' arm , " one spluttered . " We would n't ' urt the girl . " The other intended kidnaper was bolder . " We can guarantee you a tidy sum for ' er , cap'n . She 'll bring more'n ' er weight in gold from a certain duke we know . It wo n't matter that she 's no virgin even . " His eyes went to Heather and he grinned , showing badly rotted teeth . " She 's well worth the price , cap'n . We 'll split three ways , we will . " Trembling , Heather pressed closer to her husband and drew the bedcovers up under her chin . She disliked the way the men leered at her . She knew if they had been successful in taking her she would have been used many times by both of them before she 'd have ever been presented to the duke . They were akin to William Court , intent upon satisfying their own lusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced the men . He was casually unconcerned with his state of undress and bore the pistolswith a careless swagger which did not ease the two thieves ' nervousness . Heather felt the heat rising to her face . It was one thing to be alone with Brandon when he was naked , but to have others present  --  it was something else entirely . His male nudity seemed all the more startlinglybare to her with these men here . " I must disappoint you good gentlemen , " he said lightly . " This girl carries my child , and I am a selfish man . " " It wo n't matter about ' er , cap'n , " the timid one interrupted . " The dukie will bed ' er in the ninth month , and seeing she 's so comely , it wo n't be difficult for him . ' e 'll give her a few hours to whelp , then ' e 'll be on her again . ' e 'll pay the same for ' er now , an ' we 'll give you half seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed . " Brandon 's eyes burned coldly and his knuckles grew white about the pistols . A small tic began to show itself in his cheek . " There 's a foul odor in this room that almost smothers me , " he drawled , a forced grin twisting his lips . " Step over to the window ,  |p107laddies  , and open it for me . And do be gentle as you go , for my hands grow weary . " The two men scrambled to obey , then turned again to the Yankee smiling . " And now , my hearties , I must once more explain before you take your departures , " Brandon began in a slow , precise way , almost gently . Then his voice became very menacing and dreadful with his rage apparent in each separate word . " This girl is my wife and carries my child . She belongs to me , and what is mine , I keep ! " The last words seemed to blast all thoughts of gain from the brigands . Their jaws dropped , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dappled their brows . They now became deeply concerned with their continued longevity . " But , cap'n , she  --  we --  --  " They both stuttered in their attempts to placate him . The bolder one finally managed to speak clearly . " But , cap'n , we did n't know . No common wife would seem so fine to bed . I mean , sir  --  " " Be gone with you , " Brandon roared . " Take your leave before I throttle you both ! " They started toward the door , but were halted as Brandon chuckled wickedly . " Oh no , laddies . The window will do sufficiently well . " They gawked and spluttered at him . " But , Cap'n , would ye ' ave us break our necks on the cobblestones ? " " Out ! " The pistols threatened and the two men scrambled to comply . They scuffled briefly and the bolder one plunged through the window , whether aided or not was uncertain . A meaty thud , then strangled curses and groans were heard from below . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sea scurvy bastard ! " was the man 's cry . The meeker one gazed backwards , but Brandon gestured and the man made his reluctant departure . Upon his arrival below , a cacophony of angry shrieks , oaths and moans became an original account of the many possibilities of what might have occurred on Brandon 's family tree . But their shrieks only drew an amused chuckle from the second-story window as Brandon closed it . He barred the door again and secured the bar so it could not be lifted again from without . The sounds outside dwindled off as the two thieves hobbled away.  |p108Still  chuckling , Brandon slid into bed beside Heather who now sat in the middle of it , watching him quietly , her eyes a little wide . He grinned at her . " I wonder what damage befell the last one . He screamed the louddon'tyou agree , my pet ? " She met his gaze , then as she nodded , a soft ripple of musical laughterescaped her . " Oh , I do indeed agree , " she laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied about what I should bring . No man would pay such a price for a woman . " He looked at her for a moment in a queer manner , listening to the sound of her voice , watching the bright , happy smile . His gaze fell to the smooth , silky breasts rising full and tantalizing above her gown and to the soft transparency of her dress which concealed very little of her slender body . Moisture broke from his brow as he experienced once again a familiar tightening . A muscle in his cheek flexed as heturned away , and a sudden impulse to hurt her surged upward within him . " Considering what you must weigh it would n't have been very much , " he said harshly before he blew out the candle , and in the dark he added coldly , " If they had offered more I might have been tempted . " Bewildered by his sudden change of mood , Heather crept to her pillow and lay down . She did not know what she had done or said to cause him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unpredictable . How could she understand him ? One moment he was gentle and kind as he had been earlier , the next she was left speechless by his irascible disposition . Morning found Brandon in absence and Heather quickly jumped from the bed . She washed and threw on her clothes , leaving the red gown unfastened because she could not reach the hooks . Quite bravely she searched through Brandon 's duffle until she found a brush . Wonderingwhat her chastisement would be if she dared use it , she bit her lip and almost put it back . But there was no other and her hair looked quite impossible . There was a likelihood he might never notice its use if she were quick , and in an effort to have the task done before discovery , she started brushing vigorously . But much to her dismay he came in just as she was giving her hair a few final strokes . She jerked around to face him , looking very guilty with the brush in her hand . She sawp109immediately that he was in a foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brave . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I do n't have a brush of my own . My aunt has the few things that were mine . " " Since you took it upon yourself to use it without my permission , ' he growled low , " you might as well have the pleasure of doing so . " She put the brush down hastily as he moved toward the window beyond her and she sidled away from him with caution . She cast a furtive glance over her shoulder at him as she began braiding her hair , to assure herself he was staying by the window . Her look fled elsewherewhen she saw that he was watching her . She began to tremble and with her fingers shaking it was difficult to plait her hair neatly . She had to start over several times before she was satisfied with the results , and always she was conscious of his green eyes on her . She managed somehow to double the heavy braids and tie them above each ear so that the loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm taking you to a clothier 's this afternoon , " Brandon said flatly , turning away to stare out the window . " You 'll be needing gowns more modest than what you have on . " Holding the dress in place , Heather eyed him warily . He was dressed in a casual manner , not yet having donned his coat . His breeches were fawn colored and tightly fitting and he wore a waistcoat of the same hue . His shirt was white , as were his stockings , and full sleeved with a ruffle edged with lace falling over his brown hands . As always his clothes were immaculate and in excellent taste . She had noticed that once he dressed himself to suit his own personal high standards , he did not fuss nor bother about his attire . He was no mincing fop . His attention seemed now concentrated on the world outside their room , and she saw by his profile that his brows were drawn down in a heavy scowl . The sounds of carts and carriages rolling over cobblestonescame now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly only the cries of beggars and urchins that drifted in . She went to the bed and made it up , moving as noiselessly as she could around it . After that task was done , she sat on its edge and waited for time to pass or for her husband to move or give her a command . She waited an eternity . Her back began to ache and she leaned her head against the bedpost . She closed her eyes , but they fluttered open again with nervousness . Her stomach gnawed at her backbone . Finally Brandon moved and she straightened , drawing thep110falling gown up over her shoulders again . His eyes raked over her dispassionately . " Are you intent upon going about in that manner till night or are you going to come here and let me fasten you ? If you want to eat , you 'd better come quickly . " She slid from the bed hastily , not daring to do otherwise , and went to him , her teeth tugging at her bottom lip . Her heart thumped heavily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to displease you about the brush , " she said uneasily . " My hair was so tangled from letting it go unbrushed last night . I could n't do anything with it . " He gazed down at her for a moment , his face void of any expression , then suddenly the scowl reappeared . " It is of no bother , " he said curtly . " Just turn around so I can hook the dress . " She obeyed as the color drained from her face , her eyes full of bewilderment . Disregarding his displeasure over the use of his brush , she sensed he was still vexed with her over last night though she possessed not the slightest reason why he should be . When they went down to eat , George gave her a quick bob and a " Hello , mum , " and pulled out a chair for her , then spoke to his captainbriefly and hurried away . Heather 's eyes followed him to the door . Frowning slightly , she wondered how many of her husband 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fleetwood and of everything that had followed . He seemed to know quite a lot of his captain 's business . But brief though her expression was , it did not escape Brandon 's notice . " You need not worry about George , my love , " he reassured her abruptly . " He is very discreet . It is enough to say that he knows that you were no woman of the streets and is regretful for the trouble he has caused you . And though you may wish to disagree , he is not a stupid man . He saw the stains of your virginity when he carried the bedclothes from my cabin that day . He safely assumed you had been deflowered . " Heather felt she would die of shame . There was nothing left to do . She could never face the manservant again , knowing this . A little groan escaped her as she hid her scarlet face in her hands . " Please do not distress yourself , my dear , " he said lightly , a onesidedgrin curving his handsome mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many women who wish they could offer suchp111proof of purity to their husbands when they are first taken to bed by them . It pleases a man to know there have been no others before him . " " And were you pleased ? " she snapped , her eyes flying to his face . He was laughing at her again and that riled her . His grin widened as his eyelids drooped lazily . " I am as other men , my pet . I was pleased . But I had no need to be shown proof of your virginity . You know yourself when I became aware of it . It gave me quite a shock , to say the least . I might have pulled away and begged for forgiveness if I had possessed any inkling that you were not willinglybeginning in that business . " And he added with a soft laugh as if in apology , " But I 'm afraid you made logical thinking impossible . " " Where was the need then ? " she asked bitterly . " You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze devoured her as it had the previous day . " Not quite , my love . I had not then given you the part of me you carry with you now . If I had withdrawn from you then , there would have been no pregnancy . But as it happened , you have a life growing in you now , and I am to blame . Your aunt and uncle made it easy for me to be certain that the child is mine . " " I could , however , be lying about my condition , " she replied with bravado , wanting to shatter his cocksureness if just for a brief moment . She lifted her lovely little nose and dared to meet his gaze . " You 're not , " he said flatly , smashing her efforts without a moment'shesitation . " You have no proof  --  " she began . " Do n't I ? " he drawled , one mocking eyebrow raised . Then she knew she had charged fullbore into her own defeat . " You forget , ma belle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your natural state , and though it 's not at first apparent , you do have a lovely little stomach growing . In a month 's time it will be quite obvi-ous . " She fell silent as the serving maid came to their table . There was nothing more to say anyway . How could she argue against the truth ? After the meal , George came back again . " Would you be wantin ' me to hail a livery now , cap'n ? " he asked . Brandon glanced at Heather . " If you are ready , my pet ? " " I must beg to be excused a moment , " she replied softly , not wanting to look at him . He must surely be aware now that her needs arose more often than his . With his almost constant companionship since the wedding , her many pleas to be excused must have struck him odd.  |p112He  turned to George and spoke in a low voice . " We 'll be along in a moment . " When the manservant had gone , Brandon stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , my love , " he murmured , smiling . " I thought of other things and not of your delicate condition . Please forgive me . " So , he had noticed the frequency of her trips after all and related them as was due to her pregnancy . Was there nothing that escaped him ? And was there nothing he did not know of women ? She glanced up and saw his grin , and for a fleeting moment her eyes met his . But under his warm gaze her cheeks grew pink and she became flustered . He laughed softly when her look went chasing off and his arm slid behind her back . He squeezed her waist gently before his hand fell away again . She was walking back to the door where Brandon stood waiting when she heard her name spoken by a familiar voice . She turned with a start to see Henry Whitesmith rushing toward her holding a full tankard of ale in his hand and wearing the garb of a merchant seaman . Apparently he had entered with a group of sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was unable to speak for a moment as he hurriedly set down the tankard and took her hands into his . " Heather , my love , " he cried happily . " I thought I would naught see you again afore I left . But what are you doing here , and where 's your aunt ? Did you come to see me off ? " " Off ? " she said stupidly , not knowing what he meant . She frowned . " Henry , what are you doing here ? Where 's Sarah ? Why are you wearingthose clothes ? " " Do n't you know , Heather ? I 've signed onto the Merriweather of the British Tea Company . We sail within a fortnight for the Orient . I 'll be gone two years . " " But why , Henry ? " she asked , stunned . " What has become of Sarah ? " " I could n't marry her , Heather . I love you , and I wo n't marry anyone but you . So I come here to London to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have a man . I have a chance now to do it . When I return from the Orient , I 'll be gettin ' a full three an ' a half shares . Why , Heather , do you know I 'll come back a wealthy man . I could even have as much as five hundred pounds in my pockets . " " Oh , Henry , " she sighed miserably , dragging her hands from his . Once more he gazed upon her with adoration . His smile was broad and his eyes bright with joy . He did not notice her distress.  | " You look grand , Heather . I 've ne'er seen you looking so fit . " He reached out and touched her cheek gently and his hand trembled . " Will you wait for me , Heather ? Will you say you 'll be mine ? Would you even marry me now an ' send me off a happy man ? " His gaze dropped to her breasts , and his voice was unsteady and the words seemed to catch in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather . I love you , an ' I want you badly . " " Please  --  " she gasped . She glanced past him and saw Brandon coming toward them , a heavy scowl on his face . She looked back at Henry nervously and then he was upon them . " If you are ready now , my love , we must be going . " Brandon said , dragging his cloak over her shoulders to hide her bosom from Henry 's gaze . " The carriage is waiting . " Henry stared at Brandon incredulously and watched his arm go about Heather 's shoulders . He was filled with a sudden rage , seeing another man touch his beloved . " Heather , who is this man , this  --  this Yankee ? " he demanded . " What are you doing here with him ? Where 's your aunt ? And why do you let this man put his hands on you like that ? " " Henry , you must listen to me , " she begged . She did not want to break the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not at this time , not so cruelly . Her insides were cold with dread . " I had not meant this to happen , Henry . Please believe me . You should have taken me at my word when I said I could n't marry you . It was impossible . " Her eyes lifted to her husband 's and in her own there was a plea for understanding . This boy must not be made to suffer from Brandon 's sharp tongue . " Henry , this is my husband , Captain Birminghamof the American ship , Fleetwood " " Your husband ? " Henry cried . He stared at Brandon in horror . " Oh , my God , you do n't mean it , Heather ! Tell me you 're jesting with me ! You would n't marry a Yankee ! " His eyes fell in dismay on the other man 's dress and richness of cloth . His own rough sea garb would n't have been worth the man 's stockings . " Not a Yankee , Heather ! " " I would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replied softly . " He is my husband . " " When  --  when did you wed , " he choked out , tears brimming over in his eyes . " Two days ago , " Heather whispered , her gaze dropping . She could not bear his tears . If she had to stand much longer and talk with Henry she would lose control and run from them sobbing . Her wholep114body was rigid with her efforts to keep from doing so , and having Brandon 's arm around her did not help . It only reminded her that he was to blame for all this . But his silence was a blessing . " Can you tell me why you married him  --  a Yankee , an ' not me , Heather ? " he questioned miserably . She raised her eyes to his . " What need is there of that , Henry ? I am married now and it can not be undone . Let us say farewell now and part . You will forget me soon . " " You wo n't tell me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred her vision . " No , I can not . I must go now . " " I wo n't forget you , Heather , you know that . I love you an ' no other woman will do . " Despite Brandon 's presence , she rose on her toes and pressed a kiss to Henry 's cheek . " Goodbye , " she whispered , then she turned and let Brandon draw her away and lead her outside . In the carriage she stared out the window glumly and did not care at the moment that Brandon watched her and was in an angry mood . " When did this boy ask you to marry him ? " he asked abruptly , after the carriage was on its way . She turned from the window and sighed . " After I met you , " she replied . His brows drew together in a fierce scowl , and he was silent for a moment . When he spoke again his voice had a sharpness to it that gave evidence of his irritation . " Would you have married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at him and caution made her speak the truth . " I had no dowry . His parents would have resented me for that reason . I would n't have married him . " " You do not speak of love , " he said slowly . " Love has no place in marriage , " she said bitterly . " Marriages are arranged for profit or gain . Those who are in love go find their pleasures in haystacks or meadows . They throw caution to the wind to have each other . It is beyond me to know their reasons . " Brandon studied her leisurely . " Now I know you have never been in love , nor been tempted by it , and as I also know , you are still innocent of love 's joys , virginal as a matter of speaking . " She met his gaze . " I know nothing of what you speak of , " she said shortly . " I am no virgin . You are talking in riddles . " He laughed softly . " You almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only be giving you pleasure , and you have yet to pay for your part in blackmailing me . " She glared at him . " You still speak in riddles , " she snapped . " And in lies . I am guiltless of the plan to blackmail you . Must I tell you again ? " " Oh , please spare me , " he replied with a heavy sigh . " I have no use for mendacity . " " Mendacity ! " she shrieked . " Who are you to accuse me of being mendacious , you  --  you  --  " He jerked her to him sharply . " Careful , Heather , " he warned . " Your Irish temper is showing . " She swallowed hard as his cold , green eyes bore into hers . It had not taken her long to throw good judgment aside and flare up at him . She must learn to control her feelings better . " I 'm sorry , " she murmured in a weak voice . She loathed herself for apologizing and for being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or go beyond good thinking and slap his handsomeface . But she could n't feature herself doing such a thing , and she hated to think what he might do to her if she tried . Even now , to be caught to him as she was with his hands biting into her arms , she was filled with a fear that made her quake . And his fierce , piercing gaze tore from her what little courage there remained . She was a pluckless female who quailed at a mere glance from him . He let her go and laughed scornfully . " You should take special care to bite your tongue sooner , my dear . You will grow tired of pleading for my pardon if you do not . " " It is difficult to be silent when you taunt and insult me as you do , " she murmured disconcertedly , dropping her gaze to her hands folded in her lap . " You leave me little pride . " " I never said I would , " he said sharply , turning to stare out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you think I lied ? " She shook her head slowly . A tear fell on her hand and then another , and she brushed them away . Not glancing around , Brandon swore and impatiently drew a handkerchieffrom inside his coat and handed it to her . " Here , " he said shortly . " You will need this . And if you insist upon weeping all the time , it would pleasure me beyond belief if you would remember to carry your own handkerchief . It annoys me considerably to find mine gone when I need it . " " Yes , Brandon , " she whispered faintly , not daring to remind him that she had no handkerchief to carry.  |p116For  the continuation of the journey , Brandon sat and stared stonily out the window , leaving a cold silence to fill the carriage and a great dread crushing Heather 's chest . Madame Fontaineau greeted them at the door of her shop with a charming smile . Captain Birmingham was a regular customer when he was in port . She liked the tall Yankee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still young enough to appreciate it . He drew the cloak from the young girl 's shoulders , and her eyes slid over the red gown . She smiled with pleasure , deciding no other mademoisellecould have worn it so well . Her curiosity had been aroused when he bought this dress and other clothes for a girl so dainty . She assumed he had found a new mistress . The gowns he had purchased during the two years preceding had been made for a taller woman , more statuesque . This slip of a girl , still in the youthful bloom of womanhood , could never have filled those ample dimensions , and there was something blase yet naive in this girl 's manner , almost innocent , refreshingly unique . It was enough to set her to wondering . Many of the more successful courtesans frequented her shop and on their wagging tongues Captain Birmingham 's name was often bandied with the most complimentary phrases . Thus she knew considerably more of the man 's personal life than he guessed . But here was something new and quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose for a wife . Heaven forbid ! She was French herself , certainly not too old , and still very appreciativeof a man who could be called a man . She had often regarded Captain Birmingham with more than a business eye , though she had always been careful to leave it at that . She was wise enough to know he would disappear from her world forever if she even suggested they become more than just friends . Out of kindness to an aging and susceptibleheart , and lacking interest in an older woman , he would turn her down and never be seen again . It was then that her eyes fell to the gold band the girl was wearing . " Madame Fontaineau , may I present my wife . " The woman 's mouth dropped open in surprise , but she quickly spoke to hide her astonishment . " I am pleased to make your acquaintance , Madame Birmingham . Your husband is a favorite customer of mine for a long time . He is an expert on women . You are most beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a completewardrobe , Madame Fontaineau , if you please . " " Oui , monsieur , I will do my best , " she said hurriedly , realizing herp117blunder . Men did not like their amorous activities to be common knowledge , especially to their wives . But the shock had been too much for her . She had forgotten herself when she spied the ring . Madame Fontaineau moved her eyes over the girl and watched her walk away to look at the materials stacked on the tables . The young madame had a body slender as a reed , yet soft and alluring . A man 's hand would ache to touch it . No wonder the Yankee captain had married her . She was quite a beauty , and they made a pair , these two . They were to be envied . With resignation she glanced up at the Yankee . " Elie est perfection , eh , monsieur ? " Brandon 's eyes lifted slowly to his wife 's back . " Oui madame . Magnifique . " Heather did not understand the conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brandon had replied easily . He was full of surprises . They were conversing now in French , leaving her to wander about the room as she might . She moved aimlessly between the tables , eyeing her husband and the woman secretly . They seemed to know each other well . He laughed with her and the couturiere casually touched him on the arm , something she , his wife , could not bring herself to do . She frowned , remembering with clarity what the dressmakerhad said . It seemed she was just one of many women he had purchased clothes for . She turned quickly , vexed with Brandon for bringing her here . He could have spared her this awkward situation . She lifted a sketch from a nearby easel and looked at the drawing , forcing herself to concentrate on it instead of the man and woman behind her . It did not hold her interest for long . It was a sketch of a gown fashionably up to date , with a high waist but amply embellished with bows and giggaws , one a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Raising her eyes from the sketch , she found herself being appraised by a young man who had apparently come through the curtain at the rear of the shop just a moment before . His eyes were roving greedily down the front of her dress as if he could see right through it . He licked his lips and moved toward her . She stood for a moment , immobilizedin confusion . The lad , mistaking her pause , was heartened . He smiled broadly , and it was his complete misfortune that Brandon looked up from his conversation and saw him approaching his wife with this over-eager attitude . It was a small straw , but for Brandon it was the one that laid thep118camel flat . First thieves , then an old flame , now a stripling lad . The girl was his and not some public piece to be petted or gloated over . His patience was at an end . He 'd be damned if he 'd stand for another man feasting his eyes upon Heather . Filled with almost uncontrollable rage , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye . Heather saw him coming and with a frightened squeak jumped out of his way . He seized the lad by his coat and lifting him clear of the floor , shook him like a dog shakes a rat . " You gutter-licking scum . You 'll learn quickly to keep your distance from my wife . I 'll smear you from one end of this shop to the other . " The poor boy 's eyes almost bugged out of his head , and he squealed in helplessness . Heather stood petrified , all senses stunned , but MadameFontaineau flew to Brandon and seized his arm . " Monsieur ! Monsieur ! " she pleaded . " Monsieur Birmingham . Please . He is but a child ! He meant no insult , monsieur . Please let him go ! I beg you . " Brandon complied slowly , but his jaw still worked with rage . His hands slid from the boy and Madame Fontaineau seized the lad none too gently and hustled him to the back , chattering the while in angry French . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stinging cuff upon the unhappy youth 's ear . Neither Brandon nor Heather had moved when a moment later the woman returned . " I apologize , Monsieur Birmingham , " Madame Fontaineau said humbly to Brandon . Brushing past him , she went to Heather and took the girl 's trembling hands . " Madame Birmingham , he is my nephew and a sometimes doltish child . But ah-h , madame , " she added with a shrug of her shoulders . " He is unmistakenly French , is he not ? " As the woman laughed Heather glanced at her husband , her eyes still very wide and uncertain . He met her gaze and raised a mocking eyebrow , but he did not smile and she knew he was still angry . " Please step this way , Madame Birmingham , " the dressmaker smiled , taking Heather 's arm . " We will begin with the selection of material for chemises . " She pulled Heather with her to some shelves stacked with bolts of sheer muslins , linens and batistes . " May I perhapssuggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ? They are very soft to lovely skin such as yours . " Again Heather 's eyes lifted to her husband 's face . He stood nearby and was leaning back against the table with his arms folded across his chest . His expression did not change as she looked at him , and she feared he was angry with her . Her gaze fell nervously and she turned back to the woman.  | " It is of no matter , " she murmured softly . " Whatever you think best . " Madame Fontaineau glanced up at Brandon to receive his nod of approval , and she grinned , remembering the care with which he had selected underclothing for this girl . The chemises had to be of the finest fabric , soft and transparent to meet his approval . She would not forget when making these new ones . " He is very possessive with his young wife , " she thought , remembering his sudden explosion . " And he will have to fight many men to keep them from her . She has the look of sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better that he had fallen in love with me . " " Captain Birmingham , if you will bring madame to the fitting room , we can begin selecting for the gowns . I have some nice sketches which are of the latest styles . " She whirled briskly and led the way to the back of the shop , through the curtains into a hallway , and finally into a small room cluttered with materials and sewing . She brought out a chair and motioned Brandon to sit down , turning as he did so to Heather . " Madame , if you will allow me , I will unhook you and we may begin measuring as soon as this lovely gown is removed , eh ? " Turning her back to Madame Fontaineau , Heather waited quietly as the woman unfastened the gown for her . The whole room was hardly bigger than the size of a bed and so cluttered with sewing , there was barely room for the three of them . In those close quarters , her skirts brushed Brandon 's knees as she moved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had only to reach out a hand to touch her . The couturiere was most exact in her measuring , using her tape skillfully . Heather found herself lifting her arms , straightening her spine , raising her shift , all at the woman 's command . " Will the madame hold in her stomach now , " the dressmaker continued , placing the tape around Heather 's hips . Heather glanced up and saw a silent chuckle shake Brandon 's shoulders . She glared at him over the woman 's head , not caring any longer that he might have been vexed with her . Disgruntled , she repliedto the woman . " It is impossible . " Madame Fontaineau sat back on her heels where she was kneeling in front of Heather and thought about the matter , how la petite madamecould have this slight problem . Finally her eyes rose and a knowing smile curved her lips . " The madame has a wee one coming , yes ? " she asked  | " Yes , " Heather admitted begrudgingly with her face glowing pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontaineau murmured . Shegave Brandon a sidelong glance . " The monsieur is a proud papa , yes ? " " Most assuredly , Madame Fontaineau . " The dressmaker laughed softly . She thought , " So , he has no doubt it is his . He replies easily and without delay . Perhaps the girl is as innocentas she looks . " Aloud she said , " Ah-h , monsieur , you do my heart good . You do not flush nor stutter with embarrassment when admitting you will be a father . It is good . There is no shame in a man claiming what he has done . " She gave Heather a quick , appraising glance before she turned again to him . " And your wife will be a most charming mother , eh , monsieur ? " Brandon 's eyes moved over his wife slowly and glowed with a strange light . " Most charming , " he agreed warmly . " Ah-h , look at him ! " Madame Fontaineau thought with a sigh . " Already he is impatient to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long without a child of his making in her belly . He will use her well . Ohhh , to be she ! " " Madame looks beautiful in the chemise I made , eh ? " she inquired watching his eyes almost devour the girl . " She has the body of a goddess  --  full breasts , the slender waist to fit a man 's hands , and the hips and legs  --  oo-la-la ! " Heather closed her eyes , shamed to the very depth of her soul . She felt like a slave being sold to a man  --  this man  --  for the purpose of giving him pleasure . One could expect to be pinched and examined any moment . But it was her body Madame Fontaineau spoke of so freely , not a slave 's . The woman had no right to degrade her or her person in this manner . A woman 's body was something sacred , somethingprivate , to be given respect and not sullied by those who would make it so . It was not meant for a slave 's block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth angrily and opened her eyes , only to find herselfbeing watched in the mirror by Brandon . Time stood motionless as he caught and held her gaze and would not free it . Even when his eyes lowered to her body , making her acutely aware of the transparencyof her undergarment , she could not look away from his face . Then once again his eyes held hers and a small tremor passed through her body and left her feeling weak and giddy and terribly strange . With no answer from the Yankee to encourage her to continue withp121her appraisal of the girl , Madame Fontaineau rose to her feet , once again the business woman . " I will go get the sketches now . If the madame wishes to put on her gown now , I will fasten it when I come back . " She swept out of the room and Heather dragged her eyes from the mirror and reached for her gown . As if in a daze she stepped into it and pulled it up . She slid her arms through the sleeves and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return but glanced up with a start when Brandon reached out and caught her skirt and drew her between the spread of his legs . She stared at him in astonishment , her eyes wide , her mouth open slightly . Her heart pounded fiercely with emotion . The movement did not escape Brandon 's observant eye , and he laughed softly as he watched her breasts tremble . " Why so frightened , my little rabbit ? " he grinned . " All I intended to do was fasten your gown . " In a nervous reaction she tried to shield her breasts from his gaze by spreading her hands across them above the neck of the gown , but he only drew them away and grinned mockingly . " There is no need to cover yourself , my love . No eyes but mine are here to see . " " Please , " she whispered breathlessly . " Madame Fontaineau will come . " He laughed softly . " If you will oblige me by turning around , all she will see is a man fastening his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard his amused chuckle as he lifted his hands to her gown . He was still fastening it when Madame Fontaineau returned . " I have brought all the sketches that I have . There are many to choose from , as you will see . " The woman swept a low tabletop clear and dropped the stack of drawings on it then pulled the table before them , imprisoning Heather between Brandon 's knees . When he finished hooking her dress , she sank to the floor and began to study the drawings . These were more to her taste , but she doubted that her husband would want to spend on her the amount these gowns would cost . She looked at them longingly , then sighed . " Do you not have sketches of plainer gowns , less costly than these ? " she asked the woman . Madame Fontaineau stuttered in surprise and Brandon quickly satp122forward in his chair and leaned over his wife , dropping a hand to her bare shoulder . " My love , I 'm quite capable of buying these for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Fontaineau breathed a sigh of relief . The captain had excellent  --  andexpensive  --  taste in clothes . He was not going to let his wife think of pennies at a time like this . And since he was able to purchase a more costly wardrobe , what was the girl 's purpose ? If the positions were reversed , she would be grabbing the finest clothes she could . " Since you appear timid of spending my money , " Brandon said softly to his wife , " I will help you select the wardrobe  --  if you have no objections . " Heather shook her head quickly , feeling jittery with his hand on her . His long fingers seemed like tongues of fire on her bare flesh . Yet they rested on her casually , over her collarbone and the beginning swell of her breast , not seeming to know what they did to her , not seeming to feel her labored breathing under their grip . " But he must be aware of it and is only tormenting me . He knows I fear him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thigh was a hard rock against her shoulder blade , his hand a lead weight holding her at his feet , his head and shoulders looming above her to keep her from rising . She was caught in his trap like a fly in a web , yet to all outward appearances she sat lovingly at his feet and was happy to have his hand on her . Brandon pointed to one of the sketches . " This will go well in a blue silk the exact color of my wife 's eyes . It must match . Do you have the shade ? " Madame Fontaineau first studied Heather 's eyes as they lifted to her , then she smiled broadly . " Oui , monsieur , it is the color of sapphireblue . It will be as you wish . " " Excellent , " he replied , then gestured to another drawing . " Take that away . She would be lost in all those ruffles . " " Oui , monsieur , " Madame Fontaineau agreed . As always he was choosing well . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress a woman in the best . Another drawing was passed over with an explanation that thegown was too gaudy . Five more were chosen . Another two declined . Heather watched , fascinated , unable to speak . Everything he selectedshe more than agreed with , and those discarded she had prayedp123would be . His sense of color astounded her . The man was gifted . She had to admit he chose better than she . Many more gowns were decided upon at a rapid pace and swatches of material were tagged to them . Nothing went undone . Silks , woolens , velvets were chosen , brocades , muslins , voiles . Heather lost count . Ribbons , jets , beads , furs were accepted for trim and adornments . Laces were carefully examined and ordered . She was aghast at the amount of clothes he bought for her , certainly a great deal more than she had expected . She would never have selected so many for herself if given a free hand , and she found it hard to believe he could be this generous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does everything meet with your approval , my dear ? " he asked lightly , and she knew he would n't have cared if they had not . He had bought the gowns to please himself , to have her dressed the way he wanted her to be . But everything did meet with her approval . How could it not when it had been chosen so well ? She nodded . " You have been more than generous , " she murmured . Brandon glanced down at her . His position above permitted him the unrestricted view of her bosom as the gown gapped away from her . His hand ached to move downward under the garment and caress that silky flesh . " My wife is in need of another gown that she may wear now , " he said , dragging his eyes from her once again . " Do you have something to fit her that is more conservative than the gown she has on ? " Madame Fontaineau nodded . " Oui , monsieur . There is a little dress I finished just the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you have in mind . " She hurried from the room and returned shortly with a gown of blue velvet . It had long snug sleeves and a very demure white satin collar which fitted closely about the throat . White satin cuffs trimmed the wrists . " Is this what you had in mind ? " she asked , holding it up . " Aye , " Brandon replied . " Wrap it up and we 'll take it with us . Now we must attend to the accessories . You will , of course , have everything ready in ten days . " The woman 's mouth dropped open in surprise . " But , monsieur , it is impossible ! A month at least , please . " " I am sorry , madame . In a fortnight I set sail . In five days I shall return with my wife for fittings and in ten I want everything delivered to me finished aboard my ship . There will be an extra profit for you if they are ready and well sewn . If not , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p124Madame  Fontaineau could n't let such an order go . Even if she had to share some of the profits with other couturieres , she would still make quite a large sum . She would have all her friends and family sewing from now until that time , but she would have them ready . The man struck a hard bargain , yet he was accustomed to giving orders and having them obeyed . He was to be admired , for he would accept nothing but the finest work . " It will be as you wish , monsieur , " she said . " It is settled then , " Brandon said . He gave Heather 's shoulder a quick squeeze . " We must go now , my love , and see to finishing your wardrobe . " He helped her rise and drew his cloak over her shoulders again . A few moments later they were leaving . Madame Fontaineau stood at the door of her shop watching them go . " La petite madame is smarter than I , " she concluded silently . " By asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happy to have purchased the best for her . All women should be so wily . " Then she turned and clapped her hands loudly . " Claudette , Michele , Roaul , Marie . Come quick . We have work to do . "  |p125Well  dressed ladies and fine gentlemen crowded the shops of Londonand pushed and shoved to get where they were going . Rememberingher childhood pleasure of going with her father to these same shops , Heather felt her spirits rise . She chatted gaily with shopkeepers , tried on silly bonnets , giggled at herself in mirrors , danced about and completely charmed those persons who could be charmed . Brandon stood back and watched her and was silent . He only nodded to the shopkeepers when she tried on something that met with his approval and paid out the necessary coin . Even when unthinkingly she dared to catch his hand and pull him along with her into a shop , he allowed it and did not rebuke her . But never did she ask for anything nor expect it . She had fun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for a long time . She watched as grand ladies paraded in front of her and laughed to see fat , little husbands trying to catch up . Her eyes shone and her smile was quick and easy . She swirled gaily and turned her head with a carefree air , making her braids swing and causing men to follow her with their eyes . It was only toward dusk , when her eyes fell on a wooden cradle in a shop , that she suddenly became very quiet and thoughtful . She touched the tiny cradle with trembling fingers and ran her hand over the smooth wood . As her teeth tugged at her bottom lip her eyes raised slowly to his . She was again uncertain . Brandon came to her side and studied the crib as if considering its purchase . He tested it for sturdiness . " There is a finer one in my home , " he said at last , still inspecting it . " It was mine but it is yet strong and capable of supporting a child . Hatti has been wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hatti ? " she inquired  | " She 's the Negress in charge of my home , " he answered . " She was there before I was born . " He turned and walked slowly from the shop , and Heather followed and came to his side as he motioned for a livery . His voice was gruff when he spoke again . " Hatti has been waiting impatiently at least fifteen years for me to wed and sire children . " He peered at her obliquely . " I 'm sure she 'll be overjoyed to see you on first sight considering you 'll be quite rounded when we arrive home . " Self-consciously Heather overlapped the cloak in front of her . " You were to be married when you returned . What is to happen ? Hatti will surely resent me for taking your fiancee 's place . " " No , she wo n't , " he replied brusquely and glanced toward the approachingcarriage . His manner did n't allow further questions and Heather was left wondering why he was so positive the Negress would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The livery stopped before them and Brandon gave the name of their inn to the driver , then tossed the packages in and handed her up . Heather sank wearily to the seat , feeling suddenly very tired and exhausted . The shopping had sapped her strength and now she longed to crawl into bed and drift into restful slumber . Brandon studied the small , dark head on his shoulder a long time before he slipped his arm around his wife and eased her head to his chest . She sighed contentedly in her sleep as her hand moved to his lap . The breath caught in Brandon 's throat . He went pale and suddenlybegan to shake . He cursed himself for letting a mere girl affect him this way . She played havoc with his insides . He felt as if he were again a virgin , about to experience his first woman . He was hot and sweating one moment , cold and shaking another , a sensation not normalfor him , a man who had always enjoyed a woman casually , had her at his whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this girl needed to be taught a lesson and he could hardly keep his hands off her . Where was his cold , logical wit , his easy self-control ? Had it all flown out the window when he swore to her never to treat her as his wife , then knowing that he must n't touch her , she had suddenly becomethe one thing he must have ? But he had desired her all along , even when he thought she would never be seen again . What , pray , was the matter with him ? She was barely a woman , hardly old enough to be carrying his child . She should have beenp127somewhere safe with someone mothering her , instead of being here with him and soon to become a mother herself . But the fact was undeniable . He wanted to make love to her . He wanted to take her immediately , did not want to keep himself in restraintanother moment . How much more could he endure of having her near and seeing her in various stages of undress without throwing her down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself make love to her , no matter how much he wanted to . He could n't let his threats slide . He swore she would pay for intimidating him and , by damned , she would ! No one could blackmail him , then be happy and content after doing so . It was the devil in him that would n't let him be bested , and pride was the devil 's name . She was just a woman and women were all alike . She could be forced from his mind . He had never known one who could n't be . But Heather was different and it was n't fair for him to say that she was n't . The others had all been willing and eager partners in the games of love , knowing well what they were about . This girl was an innocent whose virginity he had taken by force and who knew nothing of men and romance . Now she was his wife , and pregnant with his child . That alone made her different . How was he to forget his own wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left him . If she were homely , perhaps it could be possible to push her from his mind . But how could he when she was so beautiful , so completely desirable , and now always so close under his hand ? Before he could answer his own question , the carriage drew up in front of the inn . It was night now and gay laughter and singing could be heard from within , and in his arms his wife still slept . " Heather , " he murmured quietly with his lips against her hair . " Do you wish me to carry you to our room ? " Her head moved on his chest . " What ? " she asked in her sleep . " Do you want to be carried through the inn ? " Her eyelids fluttered open slowly , but she was drugged with drowsiness . " No , " she replied sleepily . She made no effort to rise . He laughed softly as he reached down to cover her hand with his . " If you insist , my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a strangled cry Heather came awake instantly and snatched her hand from him , jerking upright . His leering grin sent the color burning deeper into her face and made her want to die . She stumbledp128over him to get out of the carriage and almost fell out head first as she flung open the door . It was only his quick action that saved her when he saw her begin to tumble . With a cry he caught her and swooped his arm around in front of her and hauled her back into the carriage and onto his lap . " What were you trying to do ? " he barked . " Kill yourself ? " She flung an arm over her face . " Oh , leave me be ! " she cried . " Leave me be ! I hate you ! I hate you ! " Brandon 's face went rigid . " I 'm sure that you do , my dear , " he sneered . " After all , if you had n't met me , you 'd still be living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to hide your nakedness with gowns twelve times your size , scrubbing and scouring until your back broke , taking what bit of food she threw at you , content to hovel in your corner and grow old with your maidenhood still intact , never knowing what it means to be a mother ! Yes , I have been cruel to take you from that pleasant life . You were happy there and I should be damned for forcing you from it . " He paused only a second before he went on more brutally . " You do n't know how sorely I regret letting myself be tempted by your woman 's body without first learning that you were still a child . Now I have you slung around my neck for all eternity and it does n't please me one damned bit when I think of it . Oh , but to have been gelded long ago and allowed to live in peace forever ! " Heather 's shoulders slumped forward suddenly and she began to cry as though all the misery in the world was pent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping , and she squalled in her arm as any child would who is lost and forlorn . She did n't want to be a yoke around anybody 's neck . She did n't want to be a burden , a dead weight to be endured , hated and unwanted . She had not meant to be such . Watching her slender body quiver with sobs , Brandon lost all desire to hurt her more . His face was grim and his mouth was drawn downwardat the corners . A great heaviness lay upon his chest as he searched unsuccessfully in his coat for his handkerchief . " Where did you put the kerchief ? " he asked with a heavy sigh . " I ca n't find it . " She shook her head in her arm and caught her breath as she sat upright on his lap . " I do n't know , " she muttered miserably , not able to think clearly . She wiped her tears on the hem of her gown as he searched her dress for pockets . As he did so the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Is there anything I can do for the lady ? " he offered uncertainly . " I heard her crying , and it breaks me heart to hear a woman weep . " Brandon frowned at the man slightly as he continued the search for his handkerchief . " There is no need for your assistance , sir , " he repliedpolitely . " My wife is just a little upset with me because I wo n't let her mother come live with us . She 'll be all right when she learns her tears have n't changed my decision . " The driver grinned . " In that case , sir , I 'll be leaving you to her . I know what it 's like to have your wife 's mother living with you . I should have been as strong as you when I first married my wife . Then I would n't be having the old witch in my house now . " He wandered back to his horses as Brandon finally located his handkerchief between Heather 's breasts . He drew it out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose into it . " Are you feeling better ? " he questioned . " Can we go to our room now ? " A sigh escaped her as she nodded and he stuffed the handkerchief down her dress again and gave her a little pat on the rump . " Let me get up then , and I 'll help you out of the carriage . " The inn was noisy and alive with drunken tars and bawdy women whose shrill laughter rang out over the coarse , ribald humor of the sailors . Holding Heather 's hand behind him and walking just ahead to hide her tear-streaked face from the stares of the curious , Brandon led her through the room . George had been sitting by the fire but jumped up when he saw them and followed behind to their room . As Brandon opened the door for Heather and allowed her to slip in , the servant listened attentively to his orders and went off again to do as bidded when his captain stepped into the bedroom . Brandon closed the door behind him and glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . " George has gone to fetch a tray of food . I wo n't be staying to eat . And I would prefer that you not leave the room while I 'm gone . It would n't be safe for you without my escort . If you want anything , George will be just outside the door . Tell him what you want . " She cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at him . " Thank you , " she murmured . Then he was gone without another word , leaving her to stare dejectedlyat the closed door . The fluttering was like a movement of a butterfly 's wings , seeming unreal because of its faintness . She lay very still under the quilt , afraid to move lest it would go away and never come again that night . Andp130in the dark she smiled a little to herself . Once more it came , this time more insistent . Her hand slid to her belly as if beckoned and her thoughts suddenly cleared . " It does not make it easier knowing he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage unseen , no matter how desperately I planned and hoped . They watched me too closely . I would have spent a lifetime there if he had not already taken me to him and given me his baby . " The stirring was felt beneath her hand . " So now I am to be a mother , and he is to be hated and cursed because he made me so . But must it be this way ? Is it too difficult to show him kindness and gratitude though I know he loathes the ground on which I walk and would prefer to be no man at all than have me chained to him . He has been kind despite his hatred of me . Now I must show him I am not a child and I am thankful . But it will not be easy . He frightens me and I am such a coward . " The sounds of his returning came in the deep darkness of night . He moved quietly about the room as he disrobed and only the lantern outside in the coutryard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , turning on his side to face the door . And again the room was still . There was only the sound of his breathing that came to her ear . Before she opened her eyes the next morning , she heard the rain , a heavy , pouring rain that drove the peasants from the streets and the birds from the air , a clean , drenching rain that washed everything anew . It was the season for rain and sometimes one thought it would never end . The man beside her moved and she opened her eyes as he pushed away the sheet and sat up . She did likewise and slid out of bed , drawinghis attention to her . He frowned heavily . " There 's no need for you to get up now , " he said irritably . " I must see to a few last things about the cargo , and I wo n't be able to take you with me . " " Are you going right away , " she asked uncertainly , fearing his frown . " No . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then if it would not displease you , " she said softly , " I would prefer to rise . " " Do whatever you wish , " he growled low . " It makes no difference to me . " Hot water for his bath was carried in , and he lowered himself into the brass tub when the two of them were alone again in the room . Hep131was in a black , untalkative mood and as Heather came hesitantly to the tub , she was fearful of offering him her services . She was so nervousshe could n't speak , and her hands trembled as she reached out to take the sponge from his hand . He looked up with some surprise when she did . " What is it you want ? " he asked impatiently . " Do you have a tongue in your head ? " She took a deep breath and nodded her head . " I  --  I wish to help you bathe , " she managed . His scowl deepened . " It is not necessary , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , you may breakfast with me downstairs . " She stepped back from the tub nervously and turned away . He wanted nothing to do with her this morning , it was plain to see . To keep from aggravating him more she must stay out of his way and not bother him with her presence . Moving quietly about the room , she gathered the underclothing she had washed after her bath the night before and folded it away , still a little damp . She took off her nightgown in a corner behind him and dressed , putting on the new blue gown he had bought for her . But as the red gown , it fastened down the back , and though she tried she could not manage more than a few of the hooks . " It will just have to go undone , " she decided stubbornly . " I am not going to him . I wo n't be a nuisance . " She was trying to comb the tangles out of her hair with her fingers when he finished his bath and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her direction and began to dress . He only turned her way when he came after a fresh shirt from a table behind her , and with her heart in her throat Heather glided away from him cautiously , fearing he would notice her . The movement , however , brought not only his attention but his anger as well . " Do you have to be so damned skittish ? " he snapped . " I 'm not going to hurt you . " Heather stood trembling before his glare . " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry , " she murmured fearfully . " I just did n't want to get in your way . " He swore under his breath and snatched up his shirt . " I do n't mind you getting in my way nearly as much as I do seeing you scurrying out of it . I assure you I wo n't give you the back of my hand as your aunt was fond of doing . I have yet to hit a woman . " She looked at him uncertainly , not knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was tying his stock , jerking at it in his anger and not doing well in the mood he was in . On an impulse , she went top132him and pushed his hands aside . He stared down at her warily , but she would n't meet his gaze . With nervous fingers she rewrapped the stock about his neck and tied it as she had done many times for her father . When it was neat and in place she picked up his waistcoat from the chair and held it up , while he , still scowling , slid his arms into it . Bravely she went even further and buttoned it for him , though she sensed he was restless and would have preferred doing it himself . When she started to get his coat he waved her away . " Never mind , " he said hoarsely . " I can put it on myself . Get the brush and do your hair . " She obeyed quickly and as she was brushing it he came up behind her and fastened her gown . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed down at her , and both the day and her heart grew considerably lighter . In the several days that followed she spent most of her time in their room , knowing that George was somewhere near . She saw her husband in the mornings when he rose to bathe and dress , and they would descend to breakfast together . He would then leave and be gone until late at night , long after she had retired . He always came in quietly and disrobed in the dark , being careful not to awaken her , but each time she would rouse for a few moments and feel secure in knowing he was back . It was the fifth morning hence and the usual routine had become relaxed , almost second hand . His dour rising temper was softened by the hot bath each morning and he would even sit still for long momentswhile she scrubbed his back , a dear concession indeed . These early interludes were gentle and peaceful for Heather . She enjoyed the almost silent companionship they shared . An occasional spoken word and these small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made them bearable . Even Brandon proved tractable , and on parting after breakfast below he would place a husbandly peck upon her brow and leave about his affairs . This late October morning began the same , and with her hand upon his arm they went down to the common room to have their meal . He seated her at the familiar table in the corner and placed himself beside her . As went the rote , the bovine mistress of the inn yawningly brought them French coffee to sip before their meal . Brandon swallowedhis black while Heather heavily creamed and sugared the vile brew . Soon the morning 's fare was placed before them . A large bowl of cold pork pudding and two ample plates of potatoes hashed with eggs and ham comprised the meal . There was also soft warm breadp133with newly-churned butter and honey , rich and mellow , to spread upon it . Heather faced the pudding and plate and shuddered as she pushed them away . She chose instead a small crust of bread to spread and nibble . The coffee served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drink , and she sipped it slowly . " Your fitting is set for this afternoon , " Brandon said , breaking his bread . " I 'll be here to take you at two hours after noon . Ask George to have a carriage waiting for us . " She murmured an obedient answer as he glanced at her and bent her head over her cup of coffee when his gaze caressed her casually . Her composure always slipped a little when his eyes fell on her , leaving her feverish and awkward under his careless regard . When he was near she usually found her tongue tied and intelligent answers came hard . She sat quietly as he ate , watching him covertly . He was clothed in dark blue , and the high , stiff collar of his coat was embroidered with gold thread . His shirt and stock , almost painfully white , were freshly donned and held only the lightest hint of cologne . He was impeccably groomed , as always , and so handsome he made a woman feel weak just looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unaffected . " I tore the cuff of the shirt I wore yesterday , " he said , pushing his plate from him and wiping his lips . " It would please me if you would mend it . George is not very talented with a needle . " He turned her way with a raised eyebrow . " I assume you are . " She smiled and blushed , pleased that he should need her services . " Needlework is one of the first things every English girls learns . " " All prim and proper , " he muttered , half to himself . " What ? " she asked hesitantly . She feared he was being snide with her again , and she wondered why he should lose patience with her after these days of tranquility . But he laughed softly and reached up to tease one of the curls lying over her shoulder . She had washed her hair the day before and today had pulled it back and caught it with a ribbon , allowing loose ringlets to fall down her back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave untouched . " Nothing , my sweet . I was just thinking how well you are learned in the ways of a woman . " She felt that he was making fun of her , but she was unsure and there was no way of knowing . The front door of the inn opened and a tall , young man in braidedp134tricorn and blue coat entered the inn . His gaze settled on Brandon , and he crossed the room , doffing his hat . As he approached Brandon looked up , then rose from his chair . " Good morn'n , suh , " the young man drawled . He dipped his head slightly to Heather . " Morn'n , ma'am . " Brandon introduced the man as James Boniface , the purser of the Fleetwood . As he presented her , Heather noticed that Mr. Boniface showed not a flicker of surprise when she was identified as his captain'swife . There was no doubt he had already been told of the sudden marriage . In what degree of detail she did not know , but she hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly the date the wedding took place though that indeed would be pleading for a miracle . When she began to show her pregnancy there would be much finger counting and the men of the Fleetwood would wonder if their captain and she had been lovers before their marriage . Mr. Boniface smiled broadly . " It 's a pleasure to make your acquaintance , ma'am . " She acknowledged his greeting , and Brandon motioned him to take a seat . " Is it too much to hope that you bring good news from the docks this morning hour , or is there some matter in dire need of my attention ? " Mr. Boniface shook his head and grinned , settling across the table from them as he accepted the proffered coffee . Brandon resumed his seat and leaned back , propping an arm on the back of Heather 's chair . " You may rest at ease , suh , " Mr. Boniface assured him . " All goes well . A day from the morrow the slip for the Charleston stores will be open for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it 's a heavy rush with winter almost on the northern sea , we 'll be a full six days to lifting iron and setting sail . It 's the best we can expect with a dearth of seasoned hands about the docks . " Brandon breathed a sigh of relief . " I 'd nearly yielded hope at ever leaving this port . The hands must be sought out and we must see to the ship . It 's too long we 've been here . They 'll be ready to go home . " " Yes , suh , " Mr. Boniface eagerly agreed . Heather could not share the young man 's enthusiasm . She experienceddread and uncertainty instead . She thought no more of what the man might know . This was her home . It was not easy leaving it and going to a strange land . But in her husband 's voice she heard a tone that was lighter and warmer than she had ever heard before , and she knew he was more than ready to be going home . The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoursp135her husband was gone . At her request , George fetched her a needle and thread and sewing scissors , then she set about mending her husband'sshirt , a chore she found strangely comforting . With his shirt in her lap and his baby moving within her , she felt a soft contentment and for a few moments very much like a wife . She paused in her task , thoughtful for a moment , and her peace of mind faded . She must soon pack her possessions and leave what had been her home for a perilous voyage to a new land . She faced a great unknown with a man sworn to vengeance on her . She would bear her child among unfamiliar people who might well be resentful at her very presence . She would be like a stripling oak , torn from the forest and planted in a new land . She had no hint of whether she would grow and flourish or wither and die among strangers . Tears threatened to spill , but she wiped them away and raised her eyes to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed out upon the city she had known . She thought of the shame and the grief she would leave behind and her head lifted higher . For so long now , each day presented her with almost insurmountable challenges that seemed to tear her self-confidence to shreds . At least this was a clean unknown and if God gave her courage , which she needed desperately , and strength , she might shape it into something better . She must deal with each day as it came and trust to the future to be kind . She returned to the mending , no longer content , but with a new strength forming in her , just as the child formed . Heather finished the shirt and placed it neatly folded on the bureau . George had brought her a small lunch earlier and afterward she had tidied herself for the outing . She now waited for her husband 's return . George came in briefly to report that the carriage had arrived and was waiting in the courtyard . Somewhere in the city a bell tolled twice and as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street below . Soon she heard his footsteps on the stairs , and the door opened . She smiled as he entered and greeted him warmly . " I see that you 're ready , " he said gruffly , frowning slightly as he gave her a sidelong glance . He was carrying a gray velvet cloak over his arm and he came to her , lifting it from his arm . She shrugged . " There was n't much to delay me , Brandon , " she murmured . " Then here , " he said , handing her the cloak . " The air has a chill today and you 'll need a cloak . I thought this would suit you better than mine . " She took the cloak from him , thinking it a garment of his . But asp136she spread it about her shoulders , she realized it was a woman 's cloak , and very costly . She had never possessed one so fine before , not even when she lived with her father . She touched it , feeling rather in awe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Brandon , " she gasped at last . " It 's so lovely . " Still frowning he reached up to fasten the silken frogs at her throat , but she was most intent upon the garment and would n't stand still in her excitement . She bent from side to side , trying to see it and finally drew an amused chuckle from Brandon . " Hold still , you little squirrel , and let me do these , " he grinned . " It 's harder than trying to harness a bee to get these fastened . " She giggled happily and bent her head to look over his hands at the fine cloak . The top of her head brushed his chest and a sweet fragrance rose from her hair . " And now I ca n't even see what I 'm doing , " he teased softly . A fit of laughter seized her as she tilted her head up . Her gaiety was presented in full countenance , and a smile softened his face as he enjoyed her obvious pleasure with the unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed a hand upon his chest , and the contact was electric . Their eyes met and held and the smiles faded . His hands seemed to finish their task of their own accord , then as if moved by some other force , they slid over her shoulders to her back , almost pressing her to him . Heather suddenly felt very weak . Her legs began to tremble and breathing was almost impossible . But still the green eyes held her prisoner , and in the room time seemed to hang suspended . Then a whinny and a shout from the courtyard shattered the spell . Brandon withdrew his hands and mentally shook himself . He smiled again and taking her hand , placed it within the crook of his arm . " Come , sweet , " he urged softly . " We must hurry . " Turning toward the door , he guided her from the room and down the stairs and out to the waiting carriage . It was a small livery , pulled by only one horse , and as they approached George apologized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems the bigger liveries were taken , cap'n , " he said . Brandon waved his apologies aside and handed Heather in . " There 's no need of a larger one , George . This will suffice . We 'll be gone several hours I would expect , so have a table set in our room for dinner . Also there 's a matter that needs be tended . My wife is in need of a sea chest . Find her an ample one and have it taken upstairs . " Hep137drew a small pouch from his pocket and tossed it to the servant . " A nice one , George . " The man grinned and bobbed his head . " Aye , cap'n . " Brandon climbed in and took his seat as Heather carefully held her cloak aside . With a jerk and a lurch the carriage started off , and the stiff-sprung vehicle jolted its way through the crowded streets . Rather than be thrown about between Brandon and the wall , Heather chose to lean against her husband , and at sight of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed it into place . Brandon accepted her attention passively and for the remainder of the journey sat silent and pensive . He was acutely aware of her presence beside him , the soft curves of her body pressed ever so lightly against him . The fresh clean scent of soap and rose water that clung to her filled his senses and set his mind to spinning . Madame Fontaineau met them at the door of the shop with a gay burst of chatter and led them immediately to the fitting room . " Everything is going well , Captain Birmingham , " she assured him . " Much better than I had expected . There will be no problem finishing the clothes on time . " " It is well then , madame , " Brandon said , sitting in the proffered chair . " We sail a week from today . " The woman laughed . " Do n't worry , monsieur . I do not intend to see you sail without clothes for the madame . " As the woman began sorting through the basted gowns , Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his way so he could unfasten her . A strange expression crossed his face as he lifted his hands to her gown , and his fingers were a little clumsier than usual . She stepped out of the gown , and Madame Fontaineau helped her into the first dress to be fitted . " It is fortunate , " the woman chirped , " that the styles are as they are . You will have no difficulty wearing them for several months with the waistlines high as they are , and we are leaving a good seam in some to allow for your last months . " Brandon 's brows drew downward suddenly , and his eyes fell to his wife 's abdomen . For a few moments today he had forgotten her conditionand the circumstances dealing with their marriage . " Do you think this gown will meet with your approval , monsieur ? " Madame Fontaineau asked of the next dress . " The color is most attractive , eh ? " Brandon moved his eyes down his wife 's slender body and then upp138again , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable answer and looked away . The gown was removed a short time later and Heather spoke with the woman quietly about the fitting as Brandon watched her furtively . The strap of her shift had fallen over her shoulder but she seemed not to have noticed . From under his brow he stared at the full curve of her breast and the smooth skin of her shoulder , and he stirred in his chair , realizing he was becoming physically affected by the sight . " Oh , this black gown is my favorite , monsieur , " the couturiere piped several minutes later as Heather stood bedecked in another basted gown . " Who would have thought black could be so elegant but you , monsieur . The madame looks most radiant , does she not , mon-sieur ? " Brandon grunted a reply and moved in his chair , beginning to perspire . Just a while earlier at the inn he had been precariously close to breaking his promises with no thought whatsoever of them . With little encouragement he would have forgotten his pride , his honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have picked Heather up and carried her to the bed , and no one and nothing would have interfered with his making love to her . Now , sorely aggravated watching her dress and undress , he was about at his limits . He could n't stand much more . His pride and his passions were waging a terrible war , and the outcome was most uncertain . Scowling , he brushed a fleck of lint from his coat and looked about the room . He did not watch when the dress was removed again . If they did n't soon finish he was going to prove himself no better than an animal . He would need nothing more than the partial privacy of the carriage to show Heather that he was . And it would do her little good to protest , the way he was feeling now , so wrought up inside it felt as if his vitals were being wrenched from him ; and she would just hate him that much more . She seemed so damned pleased with the present arrangement , she would probably fight like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him make love to her . After her first experiencewho could blame her ? But he did n't want it to be like that again . He would have to be gentle with her , and show her he could give her pleasure too . Several more gowns were tried on , much to his discomfort , and he cursed himself for buying so many . His scowl grew ominous and his replies to Madame Fontaineau shorter . Heather and the dressmaker both cast wary glances in his direction.  | " Monsieur is perhaps not pleased with the gowns ? " the woman inquired hesitantly . " The work is perfectly satisfactory , madame , " he replied stiffly . " It is the everlasting puttering that sets my nerves on edge . " Madame Fontaineau breathed a little sigh of relief . He was just growing weary of the tedious fittings , as any man would . Brandon looked away again and shifted his position in the chair . At least the gown Heather wore now covered her bosom and he was safe for a while if he chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocently , wondering why he was agitated . Did n't she know what she did to a man ? Could n't she guess ? Just because he had given his word never to touch her , it did n't mean that he was n't affected by the sight of her in a shift that left nothing to the imagination and gapped away from her bosom every time she bent over . Madame helped Heather into another gown and instantly began a stream of rapid French . The gown 's bodice was so tight that Heather 's breasts swelled more than generously over the low neckline and seemed eager to overflow . In his chair Brandon squirmed and swore silently . A cold sweat broke from his brow and the muscle in his jaw began to tic . " Ah-h , that Marie ! " Madame Fontaineau spat angrily . " She will never learn to sew . Or perhaps she thinks all women are flat like she , oui ? Or perhaps la petite madame is a child instead of a woman full grown . She must see her mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tiny room , leaving Heather barely able to breathe in the pin-riddled dress . She moved her arm and winced with pain . " Oh , Brandon , will you see ? " she pleaded miserably , moving to him . " I feel like a pincushion . The girl must have left all her pins in the dress . I ca n't breathe without one sticking me . " She held her arm out of the way , and Brandon paled as she moved guilelessly between his knees . There was an ugly scratch marring the white skin of her underarm , and a long vicious-looking pin protruded from the material at the side of her breast , but the head of the pin was inside her gown and it could n't be freed from without . Most reluctantlyhe reached up and slid two fingers inside her bodice against the soft warm flesh of her breast as she stood obediently motionless and watched him with trusting eyes . His gaze caught hers for a second , and amazingly his face flushed red . " What the hell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an unsullied virgin ! "  |p140Heather  stood bewildered at his brusque manner . His discomfort was obvious as he sat awkwardly ; and avoided her gaze . She moved away hesitantly and was greatly relieved when Madame Fontaineau returned with Marie , a thin , gawky girl of no more than fifteen . " See ! See what you 've done ! " the woman flung at the little girl . " Madame , please , " Heather begged despairingly . " I must get out of this dress . It is full of pins . " " Bon Dieu ! " the couturiere gasped . " Ah , Madame Birmingham , I am so sorry . This Marie is still a child . " She turned to the girl and waved her away . " Shoo ! Shoo ! I will speak with you later . Now I must attend the madame . " At last the dress was unhooked and Heather was grateful . It was the final gown to be fitted , and to Brandon 's intense relief , in just a few moments they were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . On the carriage ride back Brandon was completely uncommunicative . His frown was now a fierce scowl and his cheek twitched spasmodically . When they arrived at the inn it was almost dark , and he swung Heather down rather roughly from the carriage and reached in for the bundles they had collected . He opened the door for her and they entered the inn , noisy as usual with fun-seeking sailors and harlots . As Heather passed through their midst , holding her cloak tightly about her , one brave but drunken soul made to approach her . He retreated rapidly when he saw Brandon and the look on his face . They proceeded without further incident to the room where Brandon threw the packages down on the bed and moved toward the window . A large chest bound with bright brass straps was pushed against the foot of the bed . He frowned down at it as he passed , then scowling over his shoulder at his wife indicated the chest . " This is yours , " he said gruffly . " You might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing anyway in the next few days . " He proceeded to the window as Heather removed her cloak . She lit a squat candle on the commode and noticed a table had been set with linen and service for two . It had been such an active afternoon she had n't realized she had grown so hungry . Now just the thought of food made her mouth water and she looked forward with anticipation to its coming . Her stomach gnawed at her as she hung her cloak beside Brandon 's on a peg near the door . She was straightening the bundles on the bed when a light rap was heard on the door , and at aHe jerked his hand away as if he had been burned . " You 'll have to wait until Madame Fontaineau returns , " he growled . " I ca n't reachp141gruff " Aye " from Brandon , it was pushed open by George . Two boys followed him carrying platters of food and a bottle of wine . They placed them on the table , then departed as George lit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzical glance at his captain 's back and peered at Heather , then took his leave with a perplexed frown . After the door was closed , Heather moved to the table and began serving the plates with the tender roast beef and boiled vegetables . Not aware that Brandon watched her over his shoulder , she struggled for some moments with the wine bottle , trying to get it open . Finally he took it from her and drew the cork with one exasperated movement . He returned the bottle to her and she murmured her thanks and filled the goblets . When he made no move toward the table but stood staring at her instead , she raised dubious eyes to his . " May we eat now , Brandon ? " she pleaded softly . " I fear I 'm starv-ing . " He bowed stiffly and pulled her chair from the table . As she moved into it his gaze ran down her back , the sweet curve of it tempting his hand , and he almost reached out . Then she sat down and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated himself and took a liberal draught of the wine and tasted a small piece of meat . Heather , feeling the drain of two bodies , addressed herself with delicateprecision to the meal . Several times she felt Brandon 's eyes upon her , but when glancing at him found his gaze elsewhere . He picked at his food with preoccupation and ate little , though often he refilled his glass with the heady wine . The dinner was finished and no word spoken though Brandon still struggled with his weighty problem . Not wishing to draw some cruel retort , Heather rose and went to the bed where she began opening the bundles and sorting the contents to put them away in the trunk . She unwrapped a rich fox muff and did not resist the urge to tuck her hands into it . She blew on the fur and rubbed her nose into its softness without knowing that Brandon had drawn near and stood watching her . He stretched out a hand and gently lifted a curl from her shoulder , and she glanced up to find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , half way between pain and pleasure , and he made as if to speak but the words caught in his throat . He gritted his teeth and a scowl darkened his features . Dropping the curl , he spun on his heels and his angry stride took him across the room . He began to pace the floor like a caged cat , and Heather watched him and grew more bewildered . His voice startled her when he spoke and she jumped.  |p142*  " Dammit , Heather , there are some things you must learn about a man . I ca n't  --  " His jaw clamped shut and the small tic showed in his cheek when he turned to face the light . He stopped his pacing before the window and stared once more into the darkness . After she had waited a long while for him to speak again , Heather gathered the things from the bed and packed them carefully ' into the trays of the chest . She puttered about the room for some time , casting occasional apprehensive glances at her husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sampler Madame Fontaineau had given her that afternoon . Brandon turned from thewindow and strode to the table . He picked up his glass and mumbled an oath when he found the bottle empty , then slammed the glass back to the table , causing Heather to start and prick her finger on the needle . He stood by the table a short time , then finally came to her dragging a chair with him . He sat down before her as she put the sampler down in her lap and looked up at him expectantly . He struggledfor a moment with what he wanted to say . His hands moved toher knees and smoothed the velvet fabric over them . " Heather , " he finally murmured . " It 's a long voyage to America . We 'll be together most of the time in a room much smaller than this and sleeping together in a bed half the size of the one that 's here . It will be miserably cold and uncomfortable and it wo n't be pleasant foryou at all , especially since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to wander about freely aboard ship , or leave my side when you 're out of the cabin . It would be dangerous for you to do so . You must understand , Heather  --  sailors long from shore ca n't look at a woman without becoming  --  aroused . If repeatedly aggravated they become desperate . " He studied her closely to see if she understood what he was trying to say . She was gazing at him intently , listening to his every word , but he doubted that she associated any of this with him . He sighed heavily and began again . " Heather , if a man watches a beautiful woman and is around her for a long period of time without reprieve , he gets a strong urge to bed her . If he ca n't it becomes painful for him . He must . .. " He could n't seem to finish the sentence . Her cheeks had grown pink and she picked at the sampler in her lap nervously . " I will stay in the cabin as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " I 'll try not to get in anyone 's way . " Brandon swore silently and the muscle jerked in his cheek . " My God , Heather , " he rasped , rising to his feet . " What I 'm trying to say is  --  it 's going to be a long voyage without  --  without  --  dammit , you 're going to have to let me  --  " He did n't finish . His pride won out , and with a vicious curse he threw the chair out of his way and stormed across the room to the door . " Do n't go downstairs or leave this room , " he snapped over his shoulder . " George will be here to watch after you . " He jerked open the door and strode out swearing , and for a moment Heather sat stunned , unable to comprehend exactly what had happened . He had lost his temper with her so quickly , when all she had been trying to do was understand . She heard him growling orders to George , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as confused as she . He came in with her permission and began clearing the table , and with a small sigh she rose from the chair and went to stand by the window . Brandon 's tricorn lay on the sill and she picked it up and smoothed it tenderly , almost lovingly . She turned , still caressingit . " He forgot his hat , George , " she murmured wistfully , tracing her finger over the braid . " Did he say when he 'd be back ? " The servant glanced up from the dishes and looked at her . " Nay , mum , " he replied almost apologetically . " Not a word . " Then slowly , as if the words came with great difficulty , he added , " Mum , the cap'n sometimes takes with an odd notion , but if you wait a bit he 'll usually straighten himself out . Have a bit of patience with him , mum . He 's a hard man , but a good one . " Shamefaced , as if embarrassed by his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather smiled softly , holding Brandon 's tricorn pressed to her . " Thank you , George , " she murmured . At the door he glanced back at her over his shoulder . " Would you be wanting hot water for your bath as usual , mum ? " She nodded her head slowly , still smiling . " Yes , George . As usual . " Heather roused from sleep slowly . Brandon was in the room again , and she stirred under the downy quilt and smiled a little to herself . She blinked sleepily , moving a hand toward his pillow , then sat up with a start . It was almost dawn . The sky was light and the stars were gone . Her eyes flew to the door and there Brandon stood slumped against the sill , staring at her . His eyes were red and watery , his stock loose and his jacket askew . A drunken grin twisted his lips as if he were amused with himself.  | " Brandon ? " she gasped . " Are you all right ? " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was stinking , reeling drunk . He lurched forward and the reek of issue rum and cheap perfume struck her as if a solid thing . She recoiled slightly and watched him warily . " You privy wench , " he leered . " With your high-curved breasts and your rosy butt , you tempt a man even when you 're asleep . " His arm swept out suddenly to clear the top of the nightstand with an angry swipe , and Heather sidled away cautiously , beginning to feel afraid . " Aaah , damn you precious virgins ! " he snarled . " You 're all alike , every bleeding one . You castrate a man within his own mind and make him unable to bed another . You rake his pride from his heart with careless claws , then primp and prance and strut about like a hen before a rooster and parade your innocence upon the world with your fine noses high in the air . " He stumbled forward unsteadily and locked his arm about the bedpost . He gestured wide as if presenting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queen of virgins , poised upon her throne of ice and surrounded by a moat of purity . And what of me ? I played the game and won the prize , and now I have it home and can not touch the bow . " He grasped the bedpost with both hands and rubbed his brow against it as if rubbing out some pain . " Oh , virgin wife , why were n't you made thin and ugly , then I could ignore you as you wish . But of all the women in London town , my weak-minded self chose you , the finest bit of fluff that ever tempted any man 's eye . And you treat me not like a man but as some old buck , too worn to seek a doe . You play and pose before me and expect my spirits not to rise . You tempt and taunt then deny me husband 's rights . My God , you wench ! Do you think me some safe eunuch ? A shilling buys more kindness than I get from you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I 'll teach you , my lusty vixen , " he ground out , jabbing his finger at her . " I 'll take you when and where my little heart desires . " His eyes raked over her and his voice deepened . " By damned , I 'll take you now . " He lunged across the bed , his hands outstretched , intending to seize her by the waist . Heather squealed in fright and scrambled away from him , leaping to her feet in a flurry of nightgown . There was a rending tear , and Brandon lay sprawled across the bed , staring stupidly at a handful of fabric clenched tightly in his hand . He raised on an elbow and lifted his eyes to her in bewilderment and stared at her nakedness ,  |p145her  flesh gleaming white in dawn 's light . Then slowly he sank to the bed as his alcoholic stupor overcame him . His hand relaxed and the gown fell to the floor . Heather watched him cautiously for a moment , expecting him to rise again and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step closer and peered over his arm at his face half buried in the quilt . His eyes were closed and his breathing regular . " Brandon ? " she said , distrustfully . He did not move . His eyes remained shut . She reached out gingerly and touched his hand , ready to spring away if he made to catch her . It swung limply as his arm dangled over the bed . She came still closer and stared down at him and moved his arm onto the bed , realizing that she was quite safe now . She bent and picked up her gown from the floor and laid it over the end of the bed , then turned again to him and tried to pull off his coat . It was not as simple as it appeared . He was too heavy to be moved by her alone . There was only one thing left to do and that was to get George . She put on her shift and threw her cloak about her and leaving their room , went down the hall a short way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dire mumblings from within , then a stumbling . The door creaked open and George appeared , rubbing his eyes . His great nightshirt almost masked the bandy legs thrusting from the bottom . His toes curled away from the chill floor , and from his head a long knit nightcap dangled . His eyes widened when he saw her through his drowsiness , and he hurriedly placed his lower half behind the door . He cast a jaundiced eye to the dawn streaming through the window , then looked at her again . " Mum ! What be you doing this hour ? " " Will you come , George ? " she asked softly . " The captain has taken ill of spirits and I need your assistance in moving him . " He frowned his confusion at her but replied , " Aye , mum . Be but a moment . " Heather returned to the room and George followed a short time later with his trousers properly in place . He saw Brandon sprawled on the bed and his eyes widened in surprise . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he gasped . He cast a glance awry at his mistress . " It 's not a normal thing for ' im , mum , I assure you . " She did n't reply but turned to Brandon and began easing a shoe from his foot . George 's gaze went past her to the torn gown tossed over the foot of the bed , and he hurriedly attended his captain without another word . He straightened him about and together they removedp146his coat , stock and waistcoat . Except for an occasional groan or sigh , Brandon did not wake from his drunken dreams . Only his breeches remained when Heather 's eyes met George 's in indecision , and they silently agreed to leave him thus . They pulled the sheet over him and before George left he set the night bucket beside the bed , close to Brandon 's head . He paused at the door . " It will be nigh on to noon before he rouses , mum . I 'll bring you a little something to ease his head before then . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murmured , " Good day , mum . " Heather closed the door behind him and returned her cloak to the peg . Dragging a quilt from the bed she went to the large chair in the room and curled into it , tucking her feet under her , and began working on her sampler . Slowly the shock of Brandon 's return wore off and in its stead came rising anger . The sampler no longer was stitched with slow , calm motion . The needle was jabbed in it and jerked through as if in vengeance upon the cloth . " He roams the streets and finds no purchased paramour lively enough to meet his taste , " she hissed to herself , " And then he stumbleshere and seeks to make me again his nanny goat ! " She glared at Brandon as he slept soundly on his pillow , looking as innocent as a well fed baby , and stabbed the needle through the sampleragain . " You horny fool ! " She yanked the thread . " It 's only when you 've sacked the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villain who tempted your soul ! " His lack of response drew her courage further out . It was rare indeedthat she had a chance to display her anger and sarcasm without fear of retribution . She whipped the needle through again . " You curse all virgins now but not so long ago you found it met your mood to take me . " She flew out of the chair , throwing the sampler on the floor and in a highly agitated state began to pace the room . " What does he think me ? That I would wait humbly and when he snaps his fingers , fall into bed like a well-trained bitch ? " Her eyes fell on the coat hanging over the back of a chair , the shoulders broad , the waist narrow . " Does he think I dote upon him and plan to spend my life servinghis whimsy ? " She whirled and strode to the side of the bed to look down at him , still uncommunicative in his dreams.  | " You blithering ninny , I am a woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have chosen and you stripped me of even that . I 'm a living , breathing human being , and I do have some pride . " With an infuriated groan she spun about and stormed to her chair again , flinging the quilt about her as she sat down . A small snide smile twisted her lips as she gazed at his handsome face . Ah , but he was a magnificent man ! It was past ten of the morning when she woke from a nap in the chair . Brandon still slept soundly , and as she rose she gave him a contemptuous sneer before going about the business of getting dressed . George brought her a cup of tea and a muffin , and after she ate she tidied the room and returned to her sampler to wait the waking of her husband . Noon had long since passed when the first groan was heard from the bed , and in a calm way she continued stitching , watching him as he sat up cautiously on the side of the bed . He put his tousled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too burdensome for his shoulders and moaned . Then he caught a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye and he straightened painfully . " Get my robe , " he growled . She put her sampler down and went to the wardrobe . He glared at her as she came to him and took it from her . Refusing her help , he put it on and stood up slowly . In agony he walked toward the door and opened it . " Have my bath ready when I get back , " he snarled . " And it best be hot or I 'll chew your little rump . " After he closed the door behind him she allowed herself a smile of satisfaction at his discomfort , but she hurriedly saw to his bath , knowingit was safer to obey him . When he came back he was paler , but he was walking a little easier as though he thought his head might stay on . He shed his trousers , handed them to her without a glance and stepped carefully into the steamy bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hot water and gave a long sigh when he settled comfortably against the back of the brass tub . He sat quite still for the longest time , his eyes closed , his head resting back on the rim , then there was a knock on the door and his eyes flew open angrily . " Blast it , stop that hammering ! " he bellowed , then he grimaced and in a lower voice continued . " Come in if you must ! " Carrying a small tray bearing a snifter filled with a liberal portion of brandy , George tiptoed gingerly into the room with his head slunk low on his shoulders . He exchanged a hurried glance with Heather to seep148how she was faring and decided she was weathering the storm very well . He handed his captain the drink and beat a hasty retreat . Brandon swallowed half the contents of the glass in one gulp and eased his head back to the tub again , feeling the brandy spread its glow . Heather readied his towel and clothes , then moved to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she stood staring down at him , holding the sponge and soap in her hands . Sweat rolled from him freely as he sat in the hot water , taking the evening 's poisons with it . He had his eyes closed and his arms lay on the rim of the tub , and he looked almost content . Too content . Feeling an urge to interrupt his reverie , she reached out and dropped the soap and sponge into the water . He started slightly as water splattered on his face , and he opened one eye and peered at her . The water trickled down his face and into his beard but he made no move to wipe it away . The eye bore into her as if he contemplated her slow dismemberment , and Heather lost courage when he opened the other . She quickly glided away to a safe distance and busied herself with inconsequential chores as he stared at her . She returned , though somewhat cautiously , to help when he finally sat up to bathe . He saw her reaching for the soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here , you blasted wench ! " he yelled . " Get out of my sight ! I can wash myself . I never could stand a she-cat scratching at my back anyway ! " Heather dropped the soap with a start and hurriedly skittered away . She went to the door and had opened it when he inquired snidely : " And where do you think you 're going like that ? " Her hand went over her shoulder to the back of her dress ; she had forgotten her half-dressed state . She raised her nose into the air . " I 'm going down the hall to have George fasten my gown , " she replied with a stately air . She quickly closed the door before he could comment , but she gatheredfrom the outburst of oaths and curses coming through that he was none too pleased with her . As it happened , a chambermaid passed as she moved down the hall , and Heather requested her assistance in hooking the gown . It was the Sabbath and the inn was quiet , the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at their usual table and spoke casually with the innkeeper 's wife . She had not long to wait before Brandon joined her . He scowled as he came in and took his seat without a word . It was only after the mistress of the inn served themp149their meal and went again about her business that he growled at her in a low voice . " Unless you want me to turn you across my knee , madam , and throw up your skirts to paddle your bare backside , I suggest that you take care with what you do . " She turned round , innocent , blue eyes to his , feigning complete ignoranceto the cause of his anger . " Whatever is it , my love , that makes you want to beat your wife , and she carrying your child ? " His jaw twitched . " Heather , " he ground out . " Do not play coy with me . You would see I am not in a jesting mood . " Heather swallowed hard and turned her attention to her plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissuade her . Again she was completely cowed . It was only when they were retiring for bed that night that he noticed the torn gown hanging in the wardrobe . He fingered it lightly and frowned , then watched Heather climb into bed in her shift . He blew out the candle and undressed in the dark and lay for a long time staring at the ceiling with his hands under his head . There was a slight movement beside him and he glanced Heather 's way . She lay on her side with her back to him as far away as she could manage without falling off the bed . She had pulled the quilt over her shoulders as if it would give her protection against him . With a silent oath he turned from her , deciding that nothing had happened after all because she seemed too well pleased with herself and he did not feel relief within his body . The next morning Brandon hauled his wife out of bed before dawn , giving her no time to protest . " Hurry up , wench , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleetwood in this morning and I must get out to her . " He helped her dress as he threw on his own clothes , then pulled her along with him downstairs and ate a hurried meal as she drank tea and tried not to yawn . Afterward he escorted her outside through the darkness to the convenience behind the inn and waited until she was done . He deposited her safely in their room and gave George his orders . Then he left and did n't return until the wee hours of morning , and as before , he undressed in the dark and crawled into bed beside her , taking care not to wake her . The following days the schedule was the same , and except for those moments in the morning Heather did not speak to Brandon . She stayed in their room while he was gone and occupied her time as best she could . She ate her meals there or , if few sailors were about , in the common room under George 's guard.  |p150It  was the fourth night of the week when Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expecting him at that hour of the evening , and when the door opened she gasped . Brandon hesitated a moment at the door , surveying with pleasure this charmingly domestic and most attractive scene . She sat upright with her arms folded demurely across her , her blue eyes wide and only now recovering from surprise . Her skin glistened wet and shimmered in the soft candlelight , and with her hair piled on her head , a few loose curls dropping coyly to her shoulders , she was a fetching sight , by far the loveliest thing he had seen that day . A small stool stood beside the brass tub to assist in entering and upon it sat a bottle of bath oil and a large bar of scented soap . He smiled tenderly and leaned against the door , closing it . With measured tread he crossed to the tub and placing one hand on the far side , leaned down as if to kiss her . " Good evening , sweet , " he murmured softly . Confused by his gentle manner and feeling trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about her shoulders . She made an attempt to return his smile but her lips were unsteady . He chuckled softly at her effort and straightened and his face was replaced by his hand holding a bar of soap . The soap hit the water in front of her face and the drenching splash left her spluttering and gasping for breath . She opened her eyes to find a towel being held close to her . " Wipe your face , sweet , " he chided . " It 's all wet . " In a rage she snatched the towel and pressed it to her eyes . " Oh , you  --  you  --  " she choked angrily . He laughed softly and walked away , and when she again looked at him he was sitting in a chair with his feet stretched out before him , watching her with a contented smile on his face . She glared at him and his smile only deepened . " Enjoy your bath , love , " he said , then he leaned forward as if to get up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She gritted her teeth in frustration and started to rise from the tub , but he settled back in his chair and waved her back down . " Do relax , Heather , and enjoy it , " he admonished more seriously . " It 's likely to be the last good one you 'll have for some time to come . " She sat back and turned to him with a bewildered look , thinking that he had chosen a new way to discipline her . " Brandon  --  I beg of you . My pleasures are small and this one I particularly cherish . " She looked at him pleadingly . " I beseech your kindness , Brandon , not to take this from me . Oh , please . I do enjoy it so . "  |p151She  bit a quivering bottom lip and dropped her gaze . The grin faded from Brandon 's face and he rose and came to the foot of the tub . He leaned his hands upon it and stood looking at her . She sat with her eyes cast down , dejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke it was most gently . " You do me grave injustice , Heather , to imply that I , in spite , would deny you such joy . I spoke only of this : that tomorrow we go aboard the ship as we will sail some three days hence . " She raised her head to meet his gaze and her breasts caught the glow of the candles and glistened in the light . " Oh , Brandon , I am sorry , " she murmured humbly . " It was shrewishof me to underrate you so . " She paused , noticing that his gaze no longer met hers but was directedlower . His lips were white and the tic returned to his cheek as she watched . She blushed deeply , and with an inarticulate murmur of apology drew the large sponge to her breasts . Brandon turned away abruptly and went to stand before the window . " If you will extract yourself from the tub , madam , " he said gruffly over his shoulder , " we might dine in more civilized circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch a small supper . " Heather complied with considerable haste . It seemed only a few moments after she had gone to sleep that Brandon was shaking her awake . It was still dark outside , but he was already dressed . He pulled her from the bed and handed clothes to her . She slid into her gown and he helped her yank it down into place and began hooking it while she brushed her hair into order . He wrapped her cloak about her and stood by the door as she rubbed the last traces of sleep from her face with a damp cloth . Then they descended to eat a quick meal and a short time later were walking the few blocks to the ship . The crew was already astir , making the ship ready for the day 's loading , and the men paused to watch the captain and his lady board , and their eyes followed them until they disappeared through the door under the quarter-deck . Once in the captain 's cabin , Heather discarded her cloak and curled up in his bunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a quilt over her . After finishing a small lunch which he brought her at noon she climbed up to the deck and stood by the rail to watch the activity of the sailors and the port . Vendors swarmed about the docks selling fresh fruit and vegetables to sailors craving a break inp152their monotonous diet of salt pork , beans and sea biscuits . Rich merchants , dressed nattily in their finery , rubbed shoulders with beggars and thieves who tried to reduce the size of their purses . Sailors strolled along with harlots , caressing them openly , and liveries with their straight-backed drivers were waiting for hire . Vivid colors mixed with the dull to dress the seaport in its every day splendor . Ships were being loaded and unloaded and the sound of sailors ' swearing mingled withpeddlers ' cries and the voices of merchants ' bargaining . Two seamen from the Fleetwood kept the dock area clear where the wagons drew up to unload their supplies . She had never seen a place so bustling with activity , and she watched a little breathlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the things that went on below her . She could hear Brandon 's deep , authoritative voice every now and then , from different parts of the ship , giving orders to his men as they laid cargo aboard . At intervals she would see him talking with Mr. Boniface or the bo'sun or the mate . On other occasions he would be down on the dock speaking with merchants . It was late afternoon when she saw George drive up in a horsedrawncart loaded down with her trunk , Brandon 's duffle bag and , to her surprise , the brass tub from the inn . Confused , she watched him unload the items from the cart and bring them aboard . When he set the tub down , he turned to smile up at her , and then she knew that Brandon had bought the tub for her . Her eyes went past George to her husband who stood beyond him with Mr. Boniface . He had glanced around to watch the servant bring the tub aboard and now his eyes lifted to hers . Their gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly very happy and alive . No gift of greater beauty or fortune could have pleased her so well as this old brass tub . The corners of her mouth lifted and the smile was soft and warm and beautiful , and gazing up at her , Brandon was held for a moment in its spell , then James Boniface cleared his throat and repeated his question . It was evening before Madame Fontaineau and two of her assistants brought Heather 's clothes . After they had found everything satisfactory , Brandon brought an iron strongbox from his sea chest and began counting out the necessary sum . The couturiere sidled around to look over the top of the box at the contents and gasped audibly at the great amount of money which it contained . Brandon raised an eyebrow at the woman , sending her back to her place across the desk , then continuedwith his counting . Madame Fontaineau glanced at Heather , who was kneeling besidep153her trunk packing the gowns and other items away , then turned again to Brandon , smiling with a calculating gleam in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reckless . " Will the madame be returning with you next year , monsieur ? " " No , " Brandon answered . Madame Fontaineau 's smile broadened and she smoothed her hair . " When you return you will of course come to my shop to buy her new clothes , will you not , monsieur ? I will be looking forward to sewing again for her . " And then she cooed . " My talents will be at your disposal , monsieur . " The remark passed Heather 's innocent ears without notice , and she did n't glance up from her task , but Brandon understood clearly the woman 's intent . His eyes raised slowly to Madame Fontaineau and he regarded her for some moments passively , then very coldly his gaze traveled down her as if appraising her for her worth , stopping momentarilyon the somewhat matronly bosom and the broadening hips . His eyes dropped again to the money . " You misunderstand me , madame . I mean that I will not be returning to England again . This is my last voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandon reached across the desk a moment later and handed her the money due in a pouch and Madame Fontaineau did n't stop to count it . She whirled and left withoutanother word . Brandon was preoccupied with other things at the evening meal so that there was hardly a word exchanged between them , and long after Heather retired to the bunk he worked at his desk with ledgers , receiptsand bills . It was past the hour of midnight before he blew out the candles , undressed in the dark and climbed in beside her . Still awake , Heather rolled over to make room for him but there was not much space to spare . Brandon turned on his side away from her and she on hers away from him , and each for different reasons tried not to think of what had taken place when they had last occupied the bunk together . The next two days passed quickly . The loading was finished , the provisioning completed , the last hatch battened down and final farewells spoken . Long boats came to tow the Fleetwood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the evening 's offshorebreeze . All aboard grew quiet and thoughtful , yet the ship seemed to cluck impatiently for that fresh zephyr to set her on the way home . It was a calm evening , the water glassy smooth . The ship sat withp154her topsails and topgallants spread but hanging slack , waiting for the first breath of wind . The sun was half down behind the rooftops of London when a topsail flapped loudly in the quiet . All eyes drew immediately aloft . The sun was gone now , and a chill breeze stirred against Heather 's face as she stood beside Brandon on the quarterdeck . The sails flapped again , and then filled as the breeze strengthenedand Brandon 's voice rang out . " Weigh anchor . Look lively , hearties , we 're sailing home . " The anchor winch began to clank from the forecastle and Brandon 's voice took on an almost gay note . " Ease off those port tacks . Take in the starboard . " The anchor splashed free of the Thames , and the ship began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness and there was a tightness in her throat . It was the wee hours of the morning before Brandon came to the cabin to sleep , and at breakfast he told her what was expected of her on the voyage . " As far as I 'm concerned , Heather , the decks belong to the men until a reasonable hour of the morning . If you venture out too early , you might find yourself blushing . I advise you to stay in the cabin until a late hour . " She murmured an obedient answer , keeping her gaze fixed on her plate , and her cheeks took on a rosy hue . " And below decks is completely off limits to you , " he continued . " The living quarters of the men are there , and you are too tempting a prize for a man on a long voyage . I would n't want to have to kill any of my men because they forgot themselves . Therefore , you will stay from there and out of their way . " He glanced up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own cup of tea and stared down into it , her face still flushed . Her slender hands were wrapped around the cup and the gold wedding band , sliding loose on her finger , caught the light of thmorning the sun . He frowned slightly and his gaze dropped . Late afternoon , shortly after four , Heather heard the lookout call : " Land 's end , ahoy . Fore quarter starboard . " The day was wintry gray with low clouds scudding across the sky . The wind was blowing a brisk nor'easter as she climbed to the quarterdeck . Brandon stood beside the wheel watching the south of England sweeping by and when land 's end stood behind them , he turned to the man at the wheel.  | " Helmsman , bring her about . Steady on due west . " And then he bellowed to the tops . " Watch those gallants , lads , and take another reef in the mainsail . " He stood for some time with his hands behind him and his feet braced apart , feeling the deck beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied his ship stood neatly trimmed with the wind on her heels . The sun sat low and red upon the horizon , painting the clouds a golden hue and splattering the sea in red . Land 's end stood behind them now , all black and gold beyond the mists . With an aching in her chest , Heather watched the last of England fade from view and from her life.  |p156The  sun rose cold and bleak on the fourth day out and the easterly winds began to pick up . The first two days had been relatively mild and with every inch of canvas spread the Fleetwood had plowed along over lightly rolling seas . Now the rigging sang in the wind and the ship strained as it chopped its way through frothy white caps . The ship was heavily laden and rolled low in the water , yet she handled well and responded smoothly to the helm . Brandon cast a weather eye ahead to a low bank of clouds on the horizon , stowed his sextant and folded away his charts . The wind was biting cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled to himself as he went below for they were making good time , almost forty leagues a day . He entered the cabin , put away the charts and sextant and poured himself a mug of coffee from the pot on the small stove . As he sipped the hot brew he looked at Heather still asleep in his bunk . Her hand , partly concealed by the lace on the sleeve of her gown , lay across his pillow and her softly curling hair was caught beneath it . He thought of her warm and soft against him , and he wondered briefly how much of a fight she 'd put up if he tried to take her now . She stirred slightly as if aware that she was being watched , and he forced the thought from his mind . She stretched lazily under the quilts , and her eyes fluttered open slowly . She saw him and smiled a timid morning greeting . At that moment George knocked gently on the door , and she flew out of the bunk , giving Brandon a glimpse of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on a wrapper . At Brandon 's call the servant entered with a tray bearing their morning meal . From his pocket George passed Heather an orange , and she thanked him graciously . Brandon , seeing this movement over hisp157shoulder , raised an eyebrow , wondering if the servant was becoming enamored with his wife 's beguiling innocence . " We 'll be having guests for dinner tonight , George , " he said abruptly , turning round . He felt Heather 's surprise but he did n't look at her . " I have asked Mr. Boniface and the mate , Tory MacTavish , to join us . You will attend to it please . " " Aye , cap'n , " the servant replied as he cast a quick glance at Heather . She had already turned away and seemed intent now on warming her hands above the stove . But there was no mistaking that she was upset , and George shook his head in consternation at the younger man 's boorish manner . The captain could not stubbornly maintain his independent bachelorish ways as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrayed in one of her new gowns with her back to the little stove , waiting for Brandon to finish dressing . She had chosen the gown more for warmth than anything else . It was of a burgundy velvet with long sleeves and a high , close fitting neck and a bodice embellished liberally with black jets and tiny sparkling beads . She had swept her hair into a fashionable coiffure , and she presented now a most enchanting contrast in this otherwisetotally masculine setting . As he gave her a critical appraisal Brandondecided she made a very fetching sea captain 's wife . He smiled with amusement as she sidled closer to the stove and lifted her skirts to let the heat rise under them . " The way you 're hugging that stove , madam , I doubt if you 'll favor the weather that lies ahead . " He glanced down at her slim ankles appearing beneath the lifted hem and thought of the icy winds that would ruffle her skirts and send her shivering to find warmth . Her daintily made chemises would be little protection when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made a mental note to himself that he 'd do something about that later . " Will it be that much colder , Brandon ? " she inquired , a little forlornly . He laughed softly . " Indeed , madam . We are taking the northern route just south of Newfoundland so that we may gather time lost in our delay at leaving England . As it is , I do not expect to be home before the new year , though I have reasons to hope that we might make it before then . " The mate and the purser seemed to enjoy the evening and in particularher presence aboard the ship . If they were aware of her circumstancesthey gave no indication . Upon entering the cabin they hadp158presented her with a tiny replica of the Fleetwood and thanked her graciously for her invitation . Brandon was somewhat taken aback by their assumption that the invitation had come from her and stood aside half mockingly as she accepted the gift , saying that she would cherish it . The evening progressed smoothly as they entertained her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make theevent gay and engaged in light-hearted buffoonery as they made mock battle of retrieving a napkin she had dropped and positioning her chair at the table . Occasionally she felt Brandon 's scowl upon her as she giggled her delight with their humor and sensed his strange possessiveness . Under cover of the meal she glanced often to his face and ponderedon his moods . His rage at a boy in a dressmaker 's shop , his cold anger with two thieves who would steal her from him and with herself when she would have a servant fasten her gown . Yet on every turn of hand he left no doubt that he felt no great love for her . Indeed that he sorely felt the bite of ball and chain . What reason then ? Greed ? Hardly . She had ample proof of his generosity . The lavish wardrobe , the food they dined upon . The best wines graced the table , the best cigars waited to be smoked . No . It was not greed . But some strange anger grew when other men enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was she wed to ? Would life with him ever be a normal thing , or just a game of guess with her always wrong ? The meal was over , the table cleared , the cigars now lit with profuse apologies to her , and the talk turned to business . Mr. Boniface asked if it would not be safer to take a southern route . Brandon sipped his wine thoughtfully for a moment and then replied . " A week before we lifted anchor , " he told the younger man , " two merchant vessels left for Charleston with their holds full . Each took the southern route . If they reach port before us our cargo will be worth half of what it will be if we can beat them . It is my hope that we reach our destination prior to their arrival . This is my last voyage and I plan to make a good profit from it for all concerned . " " That 's fair thinking , captain , " Tory MacTavish grinned , being a man fond of money . Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested heavily in the cargo , " Brandon continued . " I 'd like to see our money doubled . If we make it back in time it willbe . " Mr. MacTavish fingered his heavy , tawny mustache . " Aye , captain.  |p159It  's worth the gamble . My own share will be a lot bonnier if we make it on time . " " As mine will be , " the purser admitted , smiling . " Will Jeffie be settling down now that you 've taken yourself a bride , captain ? " MacTavish inquired with a lively sparkle in his blue eyes . Brandon quickly glanced across the table at Heather before he chuckled and shook his head . " As far as I know , MacTavish , he prefersto lead the bachelor life despite Hatti 's constant nagging for him to do otherwise . " " Seeing that you 've done so well for yourself , captain , " Mr. MacTavish replied , turning a warm , friendly smile upon Heather , " he may be tempted to change his mind . " Her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gaze fall on her and stay as if he were contemplating this statement and studying her for its truth . Her hands began to tremble and finally her eyes raised to his , and their gaze met across the table . Mr. Boniface and Mr. MacTavish exchanged knowing grins . The two men silently agreed not to delay their departure . But when the door was closed behind them , Brandon once more returned to his desk and his books and Heather to her sampler , sitting as close to the heat as she could . The small iron stove was insufficient , and she shifted her position often in an effort to keep all parts at a reasonable temperature . Her movements finally distracted Brandon , and putting away his quill , he turned away from his work . For a while he sat glowering at her with his elbow on the desk and his other hand upon his knee . Finally he rose and came to stand over her , and with his hands folded behind his back , his feet braced apart , he stood for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She laid aside the sampler and looked up at him . " Is there something wrong , Brandon ? " she questioned , no longer able to bear his perusal . He did n't seem to hear her . He turned on his heels and went to his sea chest and raised the lid . He began to remove bundles from within , placing them carelessly on the floor until he came to a small one with which he rose and returned to her . " You may find these uncomfortable at first , madam , but I think their refinements will soon become apparent . " She opened the bundle cautiously and stared in complete confusion at the contents . Grinning at her dumbfoundedness , Brandon reached down and lifted one of the lightly quilted garments from the stack and held the piece up for her inspection.  |p160Totally  bewildered , she asked , " M'lord , you doubt my chastity ? You 'd bind me up in these ? " His shoulders shook with laughter . " They 're like a pair of men 's breeches , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . " She just stared at them . " You do n't know the difficulty I had getting these made for you , " he grinned . " Every tailor thought me mad when I described what I wanted , and no one believed that I desired to put them on a woman . I had to pay a good sum to have them made . " " You say I 'm to wear these under my gowns ? " she inquired incredulously . He nodded , amused at her dismay . " Unless you prefer to feel thecold wind up your skirts , madam . I assure you I had these made with all good intentions in mind . You need not fear that I make sport of you . I wish only to see you warm . " She touched the garment in wonder and finally a timid smile shapedher lips . " Thank you , " she murmured . Another five days went by and as each day passed the weather grew colder . Heather no longer doubted the comfort of the odd garments Brandon had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first day she had worn them she laughed quite hard at herself when she put them on , never having seen anything so strange before . They reached to her ankles and were tightened at the waist with a drawstring . To her they looked quite ridiculous . She had still been laughing when Brandon came down for lunch , and she had lifted her skirts to show him while he admired the sight with glowing eyes . It was only where she was now , in bed , that she did not wear the undergarments , and there was no need with Brandon 's warmth near . His body heat was like a magnet , drawing her close while she slept , and often she found herself snuggled against his back if she woke during the night . Several times she had awakened to find him lying on his back and she with her head on his shoulder or her knee raised and resting across his legs . This caused her some shock and dismay , that she could abandon herself so completely to sleep . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had retired early to combat the coldness in the cabin , finding the bunk a cozy haven they could share when the little stove was not enough to warm them . This night she had told him of her life before they met , though she suspected he had learned a great deal about her from Lord Hampton , but he listenedp161with interest and asked questions now and then to make the story more complete in his own mind . " But how did you come to be in London that night we met ? " he inquired when she had concluded her story . He turned his head on his pillow to gaze at her and lifted a glossy curl from her shoulder to play with it . Heather swallowed hard and averted her eyes . " I came with my aunt 's brother , " she murmured . " He was going to help me get a positionat a school for girls , but I got lost when he took me to see a fair the night we arrived in London . " " What manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " he asked abruptly . She shrugged her shoulders nervously . " A prosperous one , Bran-don . " " Blast it , that 's not what I mean , Heather . Was your uncle the fool to let this man take you with only his word that he would find you work ? Do n't you know he could have sold you to men or even used you himself ? It is perhaps best he lost you . " Heather lay very still beside him , listening to his anger . She began to wonder if he might be the one person to understand about William Court . She was safe from England now and prison . But would he take kindly to the thought that his wife was a murderess ? Fear chased the thought of confiding in him away , and the truth of that awful night stayed within her . What more could one expect of a coward ? " We just put into port that morning , " he murmured softly , winding his finger through a curl . " I might have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling restless so I bade George find me a little sport . His choice has been full of surprises  --  a very fertile virgin with influential friends . " Heather blushed profusely and turned her face from him , and Brandon 's eyes ran to the nape of her neck where the fairness of her skin shone against her dark hair . It was a most tempting spot and one he craved to press his mouth to . It was difficult to think coldly at times and forget that she was his . He owned that soft , delicate spot he wanted very much to caress , to kiss . " Now I will have to explain you to my brother , " he said softly . She turned back to him with the surprise of learning she possessed a brother-in-law . " I did n't know you had a brother , " she said . Brandon raised an eyebrow and regarded her for a few momentsp162impassively . " I 'm quite aware of that , madam . There is yet a lot you have to learn of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seem fond of doing . " Heather did not take kindly to the insult . Letting out an infuriated groan , she snatched her hair from his grasp and rolled from him as far as she could go . She lay seething while he laughed at her , and tears of rage filled her eyes . She cursed him silently . Brandon came awake slowly , as if swimming upward from the bottom of a deep pool . His mind was filled with the feel of Heather warm and soft against him . Those tender breasts seemed to bore holes in his back . Her thighs were snuggled under his buttocks and her silken limbs were bare against him . His manhood rose as he thought of taking her , not with force , but with gentle coercion . Her face swam in a vision before him with eyes dark and sultry , and small tongue dartingabout moist lips . In his half dream her hair seemed to beckon him closer and caress him as he kissed her . Her arms were open and welcomingand her fingers caressed him as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pressed his entryhome and she arched her back and writhed in ecstasy as their fervormounted . His manhood and mind linked to betray him . Honor , pride , vengeancebecame as wisps of grass before the whirlwind of his passions . He started to roll over , determined to relieve his masculine persuasion . His hip pressed against her small , rounding belly and there a faint movement caught his attention . He slid his hand over her abdomenand felt it again , this time stronger . His baby kicked within her as if in protest to his thoughts . The hot blood waned and a cold consciousness replaced it . He recoiled with some distaste at having nearly lost his self-control . He rose from the bunk , taking care not to disturb Heather and donned his robe . The moon was bright and there was no need of a candle to show him his way . He poured himself a brandy and began to pace the room , now wide awake and greatly disturbed . His body commandedhim where his mind did not , and lately these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't careful , he was going to wake one night after the thing was done . He found himself beside the bunk with his elbow braced upon a beam above his head , and gazing down , he saw her innocent and tender , still deep in slumber . He thought of the cruelty and violence that had bred such gentleness , like iron which , when subjected top163extremes , blends and emerges finely-tempered steel . She had withstood the worst he could offer in anger and the abuse of Aunt Fanny , yet there was a naive gentleness that seemed inborn to her . Louisa came to mind , the full-blown woman awaiting his return . She was of a different mold from this slender girl occupying his bunk and not only in physical stature . Having had everything given to her at her asking by doting parents , she had never known cruelty nor violence . Her personality was open and easy , almost nothing could insult her . She was almost bold where men were concerned and enjoyedmost thoroughly the pleasures that could be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at not having to perform the more intimate duties of a wife . And it seemed strange , now that he thought of it , that all the times he had bedded Louisa she had never come with child . The direct opposite had been true here . The first time he had laid hand upon this unwilling creature before him his seed had struck fertile ground . Now here he stood . All his worldly ways and high self-esteem had been set aside , and he was trapped by a guileless virgin like a young farm lad barely old enough to stroll alone from stable to store . And each day her unsought hold upon his very thoughts grew stronger , and he would before long be hard pressed to withhold his more amorous attentions . In the bunk Heather stirred and began to shiver , no longer having his warmth beside her . She wrapped her arms about herself and huddleddeeper under the quilt . Brandon smiled wryly and removed his robe . Taking care not to wake her , he slid under the quilts again and took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he would forget his passions and his vengeance and just think of her as a little girl in need of someone to care for her . He was gone from the cabin when Heather woke the next morning . Another quilt had been drawn over her , and noticing it , she smiled a little to herself , thinking how kind he could be sometimes . He came down for lunch in a quiet , thoughtful mood , and hardly a word was spoken between them as they ate . His face was reddened by the cold wind , and he wore a bulky seaman 's sweater with a rolled collar , dark breeches and polished boots . He had put aside a knit cap on entering and had taken off a heavy wool coat . He was ruggedly dressed but Heather realized suddenly that clothes had little to do with his good looks . He was handsome in anything he wore , be they these or richp164garments , and if anything these rough clothes seemed to accentuate his manliness . Later that afternoon Heather left the cabin with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-deck . He was nowhere to be seen . She moved to the taffrail beside the helmsman , a sturdy youth with a fine fuzz of a youthful beard upon his face . Bashfullythe young man kept his eyes upon the compass and pretended that she was not there . She almost had to shout to be heard above the wind . " I thought the captain was on watch . " The helmsman raised his arm and pointed upward , and following his direction , she saw Brandon straddling the main topyard , closely inspecting the ropes that held it in place . She gasped and stepped backward , frightened at the dizzy height of his perch . To her the high mast appeared spindly , scarcely able to bear his weight . Her heart seemed to rise in her throat as she stood transfixed with sudden fear . She watched , unable to drag her eyes away . A gust of wind caught the sails and made them clap loudly . The ship heeled slightly and Brandon , caught unawares , grabbed for support . She pressed the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bit into a knuckle . Brandon , looking down toward the helmsman with a scowl , spied her and stopped his work immediately . He shinnied down the mast to the crosstree where he seized two back stays and wrapping his legs around them , slid slowly to the rail and then jumped lightly to the main deck . Coming aft , he climbed to the quarter-deck where he spoke rather gruffly to the young sailor at the helm . " Let 's watch those gusts , man . We 'll be putting her through a test soon enough without straining her now . " " Aye , aye , sir , " the seaman mumbled , shamefaced and quite put down . Brandon swung his coat from the taffrail and shrugged it on as Heather found her breath . " Oh , Brandon , what were you doing up there ? " she asked , almost angrily . The scare had brought her near tears . Somewhat surprised at her tone of voice , Brandon glanced at her and saw the distraught face . He stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he chuckled . " Calm your fears , madam , I was in no real danger . I was merely inspecting the rigging . " She frowned in confusion . " Inspecting the rigging ? " " Aye , madam , " he replied . Lifting his head , he squinted at thep165horizon . " Before three days are out we 'll be in a good roaring storm , and I 'd rather not be surprised by a parting cable then . " " But ca n't somebody else do that ? " she quested worriedly . His gaze dropped to her again and he grinned as he reached to snuggle her cloak about her chin . " It 's a captain 's worry , sweet , so therefore it 's a captain 's job . " Heather was n't sure she was satisfied with his answer but she could not plead with him to stay from there . " You will be careful , wo n't you , Brandon ? " His eyes gleamed as he looked down at her . " I intend to , madam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The next day dawned with a blood red sun , an ominous portent of the storm to come . The wind blew brisk but changeable and the men were sent again and again into the rigging to retrim the sails , to reef this one or let out that one . The sea ran choppy and contrary and the heavily ladened ship lurched and bucked . Low clouds boiled and raced . The sun shone through in fitful spurts , lighting the hazy gray sea with spots of translucent green . The night came ebony black and the only light on deck came from a lantern above the helmsman . Heather ventured out once to the main deck . It was pitch black and she could hardly see her hand before her face . She stumbled across the lurching planks to the main mast and clung to it . She looked back toward the quarter-deck and gazed upon an eerie scene . The mate and the helmsman stood beneath the lantern by the wheel , and as the Fleetwood tossed , they seemed to float about against the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried back to the cabin , determined to venture out no more until the storm had passed . Before dawn the winds died and the new day was heralded only by a gradual lightening . Dense black gave way to shades of gray . The sails flapped loosely in the near calm wind , and the sea heaved smooth and glassy as if heavy grease floated upon its surface . No horizon was visible for the sea blended into the clouds , and occasional low layers of mist obscured the topsails . The ship barely made headway and rolled with a sickening motion on the low swells . Night crept in on silent feet and a tense air pervaded the Fleetwood as the men rested for the battle ahead . The wind gained ground as the night grew old . It seemed a long and restless night , and several times as the wind grew stronger , the crew was roused and sent up to take in sail . The ship was tended carefully that she might be kept in the best possible trim as the storm builtp166around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running high and the craft ran gallantly before the ever stronger gusts , clawing through the crest of each wave , then sliding down into the troughs . To Heather the ship became a world unto itself , a small outpost cast adrift in the churning elements of a crashing , surging chaos . The final sails were set and lashed tightly in place , ropes were strung across the decks to provide hand holds for those who must venture upon them . The main topsail only was spread full and the topgallants were taken in to the last reef , a single sprit sail forward to keep her heels to the wind , and thus she would ride out the storm . From now until the gale was spent no man would dare climb therigging . The day wore on and the seas grew higher and the wind raked cruelly everything it could touch . Inside the ship the timbers creaked and moaned as the Fleetwood tossed upon this seething mass betweensea and cloud . Heather ceased to know where day began or darkness reigned . It seemed that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rarely saw Brandon except when he stumbled in shivering and chilled to the marrow of his bones . Getting little sleep , he ate and drank his coffee as if in a stupor . When he entered the cabin she would help him strip away his sodden clothes and wrap him in a blanket that she kept warm before the stove . His eyes grew red with strain and his temper jagged . She quietly did what she could to ease his hardship , and when he dozed she let him rest . Usually he soon roused himself to dress and go again on deck to guide his ship between the crushing blows of the rampant sea . Several days so passed when rising to another angry dawn , she found the deck was thick with slippery slush . The wind blew snow and sleet upon the straining ship and great , long festoons of ice bedecked the rigging . Brandon came below with frost upon his brows . His cheeks were white and stiff and a long time thawing . He sat close to the stove , huddled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rum-laced coffee . The brew was finished before his joints began to soften and it no longer took a great effort to move . Heather was turning the clothes spread to dry before the stove when she was startled by a loud thump and turned to see the mug rolling gently to and fro on the floor . Brandon sat slumped in exhausted slumber . Very carefully she drew another quilt over him , and when MacTavish entered to speak with his captain , she shushed the man and sent him out again . Only the creaking of the ship could be heardp167in the cabin as she sat with her sampler , jealously guarding her husband'ssleep . It was several hours before he stirred and stared blankly about the cabin then finally rose to full awareness . He set himself somewhat refreshed to his duty and his ship , leaving Heather satisfied in knowing that he had rested . Darkness had descended when George came to tell her the storm was finally beginning to abate and they were heading out of the worst of it . Brandon came in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking , she made to rise from the bunk to help him undress , but he told her gruffly to stay where she was . A moment later he slid shivering under the quilts , and she pressed close to help warm him . Gratefully he accepted her efforts , drawing her even nearer as he shook with the cold . Gradually his trembling subsided and he drifted to sleep , too tired even to turn on his side away from her . At dawn he woke and dressed while she still slept and once more returned to his work . Though the storm still raged that afternoon he came down to the cabin and did not hasten back . He sat before the stove , knees spread , coat wide , enjoying the heat , but Heather had sidled closer to the stove and stood now in her favorite stance , the back of her skirts raised high , exposing her pantalets to the warmth . Brandon casually watched her through half-closed eyes , feeling vaguely sorry he had bought her the underwear . At a knock on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brandon called out for admittance and George hurried in with a fresh pot of coffee and several mugs on a tray . He poured his captain a cup and turned to her . " I 'll be brewing you some tea in a moment , mum . " Brandon scowled at the servant , thinking how the man pampered her , and turned the same expression on Heather . She felt his tacit disapproval and hurried to smooth his temper . " I 'll just have coffee this time , George . " The servant poured her a cup , looking at her doubtfully . He knew she did not favor the brew . Conscious of both men 's eyes on her , Heather stirred sugar into the coffee and bravely gulped a mouthful , then fought back the shudder that followed . Unthinkingly she looked at George with a distressed smile and asked : " May I have cream , George ? " Brandon choked and blew a mouthful of coffee back into his mug as he came upright in his chair.  | " What , madam ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herd of cows in the middle of the North Atlantic ? " She started at his brusque manner and turning away , bent her head low over the cup to hide the rush of tears that welled up within her . He had no right to speak to her in that manner , especially before a servant . Brandon drained his cup in one long pull as George glanced from one to the other in confusion , wanting to comfort his mistress , yet not daring to . He decided it was time to beat a tactful retreat and picked up the tray and left . Brandon stood up and slammed his cup down on the table and as he followed his man from the cabin he buttoned his coat and muttered something about women under his breath . When Heather heard the door slam behind him , she sniffed and glared at the offending portal , then snatched up her needlework and began to sew , venting her anger again upon the poor sampler . " He treats me like a child , " she fussed , her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his ships and seas ! He rants and raves at me in front of others as if I were expected not to feel the jibe . " She threw her sampler aside , seeing that she was ruining it and came to her feet angrily , tears almost blinding her . She fought to control herself , realizing this was not the mood to have him find her in . She must learn to think of her child only and bear what hardships she herself might encounter . But it was not easy to play the docile wife when her emotions raged as turbulently as the storm without . When he returned to the cabin late in the day , she was still smarting from the bite of his words . He shed his storm-soaked clothes and donned a robe , stretching himself in a chair before the stove to warm himself , while behind his back Heather glowered at him . Before him her manner was cool and uncommunicative . She hardly spoke to him , only to answer when he asked a direct question . The evening meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , seeing her untouched plate , for the first time in his captain 's service , doubted the wisdom of the man he had so loyally served . The table was cleared away and she sat down again beside the stove and began to undo the havoc she had heaped on the sampler . Brandon contemplated this task with a sidelong gaze , watching her slender fingers pick the threads from the piece and wondered what had brought about this foul mood of hers . Some time later she rose and went to her sea chest when he made no move to dress and go again on deck but sat instead before the stovep169reading a book . Turning away from him , she slid out of her gown and chemise , and Brandon 's eyes lifted from the pages of the book and viewed her disrobing with a slow , unhurried regard . Her slender back was bared to the waist and there was a glimpse of a round breast when she bent to pick up her nightgown , and the flame within his eyes burned still brighter , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantalets fall to the floor , and his eyes went back to the book . She came back to the stove to brush her hair after turning down the covers on the bunk , and Brandon , losing interest in the book , closed it and put it aside . He watched her openly , enjoying this moment when she freed her hair and allowed it to fall in loose curls about her shouldersand down her back . The candles behind her on the desk silhouettedher slender shape as she stood in profile to him , and his attention was drawn to her abdomen , and for the first time he realized she was beginning to show her pregnancy . By the time they arrived home there would be no mistaking her condition , and questions would be aroused in people 's minds , seeing her that far along with child . They would soon decide that he had n't wasted any time getting her that way after reaching the port of London . He could just imagine their startled faces when he presented her to them . But those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of tempting his anger . It was just family and fiancee who would ask , and what would he tell them , considering she had conceived within twenty four hours of his arriving in port ? He chuckled over his thoughts and got up and went to her side , giving her a start . The brushing stopped and she turned wide eyes up to him . He grinned at her and put his hand on her belly , resting it there . " You 're rounding quite well , madam , " he teased . " Charleston will know I wasted no time in mounting you . It will be most difficult explaining you to my fiancee . " Heather gave a quick , infuriated shriek , decidedly miffed at his words , and shoved his hand away angrily . " Oh , you beast ! " she raged . " How dare you speak of explaining me to your fiancee ! Had you a heart you 'd be explaining her to me ! I 'm your wife , mother of your child , and you treat me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but whirled again to face him , her blue eyes flashing . " It matters little to me what you speak of to her . I 'm sure your words will be soft and sweet as you tell how I forced you to wed me , a woman already breeding . You will paint yourself the innocent ,  |p170taken  advantage of by a scheming woman , and you will not care about your child . Be sure to say , too , my love , that you dragged me from the gutters and gave me your name only because you were blackmailed into doing so . Your words will be very convincing , I have no doubt , and before you end , you may have won her virginity too ! " He scowled at her and took a step forward , and Heather quickly skittered about to put a chair safely between her and him . " Do n't you lay a hand on me ! " she cried . " If you do , I swear I will throw myself overboard . " Brandon reached out and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he advanced . She stopped only when she could go no further with the wall to her back . " Please , " she whimpered as he took her by the arms . " Please do n't hurt me , Brandon . You must think of the child . " " I have no intentions of hurting you , madam , " he growled . " But your waspish tongue does sting my anger . Be warned , wife . I have other ways to make you miserable . " Heather swallowed hard . Her eyes were wide and uncertain and her mouth quivered . Seeing her fear , Brandon turned her loose with an oath and went to the bunk . " Come now to bed , madam . I have been too long without sleep , and I intend this night to get my rest . " Heather 's head snapped up as anger replaced her fear . How dare he suggest she lie beside him after all he had said to her that day . She was not without some pride . Though there were tears in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bunk beside him and dragged her pillow and quilt from it . She took them to the stern gallery , and Brandon turned with a raised eyebrow and watched her over his shoulder as she spread them upon the window seat . " Do you intend to sleep there , madam ? " he inquired with disbelief . " Yes , " she murmured , taking her wrapper off . She settled herself down on the cushions and pulled the quilt about her . " It 's not a fit place for you to stay the night , " he informed her quickly . " The storm is not over . The window is damp and cold . You 'll not find comfort there . " " I will manage , " she said . Brandon swore under his breath and shrugged his robe off and threw it down in a chair . He turned and sat down on the edge of the bunk and stared at her . She twitched and turned , trying to get comfortable , and a sudden lurch of the ship almost deposited her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him and snatched the quilt tighter about her . She wedged herself between the beams , bracing against them to hold her precarious perch . She achieved some security , but her position was anything but comfortable . Brandon sat for a long time watching her before he finally turned to lie down . He saw the empty space where she had slept since the start of this voyage home , and he suddenly realized that he was going to miss her beside him . Just the night before she had shared her body 's heat to take the chill from him . He turned again to look at her and his voice was hoarse when he spoke . " Madam , there 's precious little heat to waste aboard this ship . I suggest we combine ours beneath the blankets here . " She lifted her nose primly and settled her shoulders into the corner . " I am so dumb , sir , that I believe there are cows in the middle of the Atlantic and my poor simple brain does not prompt me to rise from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brandon threw the quilts back angrily . " Well then , my fine feathered lass , " he retorted , " I 'm sure you and the icy sea will find ample companionship on that oaken sill . I will not beg you again to join me . Just let me know when you 've had enough of playing games and I will make room for you . You 'll not last long there . " Heather seethed with rage . She would freeze to death before she 'd crawl back to his bed and let him mock her . The night aged and the quilt about Heather slowly soaked in the dampness that seeped in through the window . She began to feel the cold and she huddled deeper in the wet cover to seek warmth . She clenched her teeth to keep them from chattering and every muscle in her body tensed to stop her trembling . She longed for the warmth of the bunk , but her pride whipped anew the memories of his cruelty and would not let her go to its comfort . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plastered to her body . Near dawn she finally dozed fitfully , but only because she was near exhaustion . She roused with a jerk as the cabin door banged shut and through bleary eyes she saw the bunk deserted and her husband gone . She strained to sit up and the cabin rocked and pitched more violently than could be explained by the heavy seas without . She felt no coldness , indeed a dry warmth seemed to enfold her . She sought to fling the sodden quilt aside but it was caught beneath her and her arms began to tremble at the effort . She cleverly changed her tactics and slidp172her feet to the floor and there she sat while the cabin lurched and swung , then finally slowed to a gentle rhythm . She thought she could manage then . She fought to stand up and shrug away from the quilt , but it clung with the determination of a living thing , and she slid to her knees and found herself beneath its weight upon the floor . Breathinghard from the struggle , she lay still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck below and the quilt above and she began to shake and shiver violently . She raised her head wearily and spied the stove and thought of its warmth . There was a chair near it . If she could but stand erect , this icy weight would leave her . She dragged herself across the heaving deck . The chair seemed to swim in a fog and retreat before her . The struggle drained her but she fought on , the quilt still clinging like a frosty mantle upon her back . She reached the chair and grasped its legs and painfully drew herself up until she could rest her head upon the seat , and there she lay panting with exhaustion . The room reeled about her and she saw it as if through a long , dark tunnel . She seemed to fall down that tunnel until only a pinpoint of light remained and then it too vanished with a startling abruptness . Brandon came down from the quarter-deck , somewhat improved in mood . His luck had held and his gamble had paid off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having vented its fury upon the ship , it passed beyond , leaving the weather cold and the seas rough but grudgingly breathing its winds upon their sails to speed them on . Yet for all his good fortune , he remembered the night before and his temper turned . He smiled darkly to himself . He 'd not allow that stubborn twit to vent her wrath upon him and dance away . She had a lesson still to learn if wife to a Birmingham she sought to be . He snapped at George to hurry the meal as he passed the galley , and stalked to the cabin door , determined to set her back upon her heels and lay the law before her . He pushed the door open , his face black with rage , then stopped short , all anger draining away as he saw Heather sitting on the floor with her head and arm lying limply in the seat of a chair , a quilt twisted about her hips and her other hand lying palm up upon the floor . She opened her eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lifted her head and tried to speak , but her shuddering made her speech incoherent . He dragged the heavy quilt from her and picked her up in his arms . Her head rolled listlessly before dropping on his shoulder . She heard him yell for George and then he was placingher in the bunk and drawing quilts over her . The servant came running in and Brandon turned and barked orders to him , but Heath/er 's muddled mind heard only a jumble of words . Again he was bendingover her , this time pushing the covers away . Still shaking violently , she whimpered and fought weakly to keep them over her , thinking he meant to punish her . He was always punishing her . " Let me , Heather , " he said hoarsely . " Your gown is damp . You will be warmer without it . " Her fingers relaxed their grip and she lay unresisting as he unfastenedher gown and slid it from her shoulders and down her body . Then once more she was wrapped in the bedcovers . Heather felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be treasured . She opened her eyes slowly to look at Brandon , but it was not he who stood above her with his hand on her brow . It was her father . " Heather Brianna , " he coaxed . " Finish your broth like a good child or papa will not be pleased . " " But I do not wish it , papa . " " How do you think you will grow into a fine young lady if you do not eat , Heather Brianna ? You are much too thin for a child of six . " The vision blurred and cleared again . " Must you go again , papa ? " He smiled at her . " You 'll be all right here with the servants . This is your tenth birthday . What child that age fears to be left alone ? " She watched his receding back , and her bottom lip quivered and her eyes filled . " I do , papa . I do . Come back , papa . Please . " " Your father is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you remember ? " " Do n't take my mother 's portrait . It 's all I have of her . " " It must go to pay the debts . Your father 's portrait , too . Everything must be taken . " " We 've come for you , Heather . You 're to live with your aunt and me . " " So you 're the girl . ' Tai n't likely you 'll be doin ' your share of work , lookin ' as frail as you do . My dresses will do for you fine . You 'll bear no bastards in my home . I wo n't be letting you out of my sight . You 're a witch , Heather Simmons . " " No . I 'm not a witch ! " " This is my brother , William . He 's come to take you to London . " " How sweet looking you are , child . Meet my assistant , ThomasHint . He 's not the sort who tempts a woman with his beauty . " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I plan to have you , my dear , so there is no reason why you should fight me . " " He fell on the knife . It was an accident . He tried to rape me . Somebody is after me . He does not know I killed a man . He thinks I 'm from the streets . " " Do you think I 'm going to let you sneak away from me ? " " It was the Yankee who took me . It 's his child I carry . No one else has laid hand upon me . He thinks to make me his mistress and have me bear his bastard child while he weds another in his land . He is so pompous . Let it be a girl . I did not mean to cry out . You startled me . Please do n't hurt me . He left his hat , George . Will he be back soon ? " " The captain is a good man . " " Oh Brandon , what were you doing up there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , then talks of his fiancee . " The heat was unbearable . She thrashed about to escape it . Somethingcool and wet slid over her body again and again with slow , unhurried motion . She was turned by strong yet gentle hands and her back exposed to the cooling caresses . " Swallow , " she heard a voice . " Swallow . " She saw her father again holding a cup to her lips as he held her up , and always obeying his slightest wish , she drank the warm broth . Aunt Fanny appeared before her and she screamed as she saw the woman holding her dead brother in her arms , a knife plunged firmly in his chest . She tried to explain that it was an accident , that she really did n't kill him , that he fell on the knife . Thomas Hint came to her aunt 's side and shook his head and pointed a finger at her accusingly . She saw the executioner 's axe and saw his hooded head and his bared chest . He pressed her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . The cooling movements returned and her father brushed her long hair up from the back of her neck . " Swallow . Swallow . " " Is she any better , cap'n ? " She was possessed by shivering . She was cold . Something warm was placed around her , and she was weighted down once more by heavy quilts . " Papa ? Do n't leave me , papa . Henry , I can not marry you . Please do n't ask the reasons . There is so much blood . It was only a small wound . " William Court laughed and leered drunkenly at her . Mr. Hint was by his side and they were coming for her . Their claws reached out top175catch her , and she whirled and ran from them straight into the Yankee 's arms . " Save me , please ! Do n't let them take me ! I 'm your wife ! " " You 're no wife to me . " She tossed about in suffocating heat and the cooling motion began again . She saw Brandon above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet cloth . " Do n't let my baby die , Brandon ! " His large hand slid over her belly and he looked at her . " It lives , my love . " Aunt Fanny laughed behind him . " Do you hear that , missy ? Your bastard still lives . " The faces of William Court , Thomas Hint , Aunt Fanny and Uncle John bore down on her , all laughing loudly with their mouths gaping wide . " Murderess ! Murderess ! Murderess ! " She flung her hands over her ears and thrashed about wildly . " I 'm not ! I 'm not ! I am not ! " " Swallow this . You must . " " Do n't leave me , papa , " she whimpered . The fields were green with spring grass , and she laughed as she ran from the person behind her . She was caught and swung upward in sturdy arms , and laughing gaily she looped her arms about the man 's neck in gleeful abandonment , and his face pressed close as he bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she recognized Thomas Hint . She fought the arms about her waist and turning , saw the figure of a man retreat across the brow of a distant hill . " Do n't leave me ! Do n't leave me here with him ! Do n't leave me ! " She was being drawn down into darkness , peaceful , peaceful darkness . She floated , she glided , she swayed , and a mist rolled upward around her and consumed her . Heather opened her eyes and saw the timbers of the bunk above her and everything was calm and peaceful , only the slight creaking of the ship could be heard . She lay unmoving for a moment , trying to recall what had happened . She had been trying to reach the bunk , but she must have fallen . She moved slightly and winced . She felt bruised , as if every inch of her had been beaten , and she was so weak . She turned her head on the pillow and saw Brandon . He was asleep in a hammock hung between the quarter-deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And he looked so gaunt . Therep176were dark circles under his eyes and his hair was badly mussed and shaggy . Strange , he usually took great pains with them . Her frown deepened as her eyes went about the room . It lay in complete disorder . Clothing was flung over chairs and boots lay askew on the floor . There was a pan of water near the bunk and rags hung on lines above the stove . She mused vaguely at what disaster had swept the place and why George had not tidied up . With a painful effort she rose on an elbow and instantly Brandon 's eyes flew open . He swung himself from the hammock and hurried toward the bunk but slowed when she looked up at him with sanity in her eyes . He smiled broadly and came to sit down on the edge of the bunk . He reached to feel her brow . " The fever is gone , " he said , as if in relief . " What has happened ? " she asked softly . " I feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He smoothed her hair from her face . " You 've been ill , sweet , for several days now . This is the sixth day . " " Sixth day ! " she gasped . Everything was a flurry of confusion withher . Six days had gone by . It seemed but a few hours . Suddenly her eyes widened with fright and she grabbed for the quilt over her belly . " The baby ! I 've lost the baby , have n't I ? " she cried . Frightened tears sprang to her eyes and panic bleached her soul . " Oh , Brandon , tell me true . Oh , Brandon ! " He smiled gently and placed his hand upon hers . " No , " he murmured . " The child is still with us . He moves often . " She choked on tears and would have huggedhim for his answer hadshe not caught herself . She brushed the wetness from her cheeks and smiled at him as she relaxed and lay back in the bunk , feeling relieved but exhausted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam , if you had lost m n after all I 've been through with you , " he teased . I have great my so plans for him . " She searched his face , hardly able to believe what her ears had heard . " You have plans for him ? " she questioned . " You will be proudof him  --  of my child ? " " Of our child , my dear , " he corrected warmly . " Did you think I would not be  --  my own son ? Fie on you , madam , for believing otherwise . I told you once I was fond of children  --  and of my own I will be doubly so . " She continued to stare at him , her eyes wide and uncertain , then for the first time her lips spoke of a matter which had haunted her of late.  | " Brandon , am I the first  --  " she began hesitantly . " Is this your first  - -  I mean , have you ever sired a child before by another woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making her flush ' cadet . She quickly dropped her gaze and murmured an apology . " I 'm sorry , Brandon . I did n't mean to pry . I do n't know why I asked , really I do n't . Please forgive me . " He chuckled suddenly and her eyes met his again as he drew her chin up . " For a man five and thirty years , I ca n't very well say I 've never bedded another woman , can I ? " He grinned . " But with reasonablecertainty I can assure you that no woman before you has ever borne a child of mine . I pay no support for bastard children to any woman . Does that please you , my sweet ? " She smiled brightly . For some strange reason it pleased her very much . " Yes , " she replied happily . Feeling much better now , she struggled to sit up , and he quickly slid his hands behind her back to help her , and she clung to him as he drew her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry ? " he questioned softly , still holding her . The quilt had fallen from her , leaving her bare to the waist with her hair streamingwildly over her shoulders and breasts . He was reluctant to turn her loose . " You should try to eat . You 've lost a little flesh . " Her eyes lifted to his face . " So have you , " she whispered . He chuckled then and helped her back to the pillows as she drew the quilt over her breasts . " I 'll tell George to prepare us both a lunch . He 'll be quite pleased to see that you 're better . He has become quite attached to you , and I 'm afraid you worried ten years off his lifetime . " His eyes sparkled . " Needless to say , my sweet , you wo n't be sleeping in the window again . " She giggled . " I 've never had a more horrible night , " she admitted . " You have a most stubborn nature , madam , " he grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it . " He grew serious again . " From now on I shall allow my better judgment to dictate , and will enforce it accordingly . " She smiled uncertainly , knowing he was not jesting . Another thought crossed her mind as he rose and turned to leave . Halfway to the door she stopped him . " Brandon ? " He turned and waited for her to continue . In confusion she wrung the quilt in her hands , not wishing to broach the subject , fearing his reaction , yet knowing she must . Again she murmured.  | " Brandon  --  I  --  " She summoned her courage and looked straight at him . " Will you tell your family that you were forced to marry me ? " He stared stonily at her for several seconds , then without word or nod , turned on his heels and left . Heather rolled her head to face the wall in embarrassment at having asked the question . He had not answeredher and the reply was now most clear . She wondered if she could bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered herself and had vowed never to reopen the subject . He took one of her nightgowns from her sea chest and brought it with him to the bunk . " Heather , if you will allow me , I 'll help you put this on . " She let him draw it over her head , and as he pulled it together over her breasts and fastened it her eyes moved over his face . He looked so tired and so ill kept . His hair had always been neatly trimmed before , and the dark circles under his eyes were deep . He had n't taken care of himself at all , and now she longed to reach out and touch his face and smooth away the lines of fatigue . " George has n't been taking care of you , " she murmured softly . " I must speak with him about that . " He ducked his head away from her hand , embarrassed by his unsightlystate , and stepped away from the bunk . He turned his back , but his attention returned again when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw her wince . " Ugh , " she grimaced . " This bed has made me sore . " She raised her eyes to his . " May I sit up please , Brandon ? " He took a quilt from the bunk and smoothed it upon a chair by the stove , bringing back her slippers which he placed upon her feet . He gathered her up into his arms , and Heather did not resist this time , looping her arms about his neck . She was rather sorry it was such a short distance to the chair . He was just tucking the quilt about her when George knocked on the door . The servant entered , carrying a tray of food and smiling broadly . " Aye , mum , you had us all frantic , you did , " he said , gently rebukingher . " We thought sure it were the last of you , and the poor cap'n never left your side one moment night or day , mum . He would n't let no other touch you . " Brandon scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George , " he growled . The man grinned at him . " Aye , cap'n , " he replied , not greatly rebuffed , and set about placing the meal before them . Heather felt no urge to eat although the soup sat temptingly beforep179her , but in good manner she took a taste and then another . A gnawing appetite grew within her , and she ate with increasing gusto . She paused and found the eyes of both men quietly upon her and felt daintily disposed at this display of her own hunger . She lowered the spoon and feeling the need to say something , raised an eyebrow to the servant . " By what I can see , George , " she said , nodding to the disheveled room , " you 've not been taking good care of your captain . " Brandon snorted and turned away , and George shuffled his feet and rubbed his hands together . " Aye , mum . ' T was a terrible fit he was in . He would n't even let me past the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again . " ' T was only himself what tended you and brought you through , mum . " A low growl came from Brandon , and he stepped forward as if to seize the grinning man who bobbing , hastily withdrew on a parting co lament . " ' T is good to see you up and about , mum , and I 'll be bringing you some harder vittles later . " Heather tasted the soup and began to eat but kept her smiling eyes upon her discomforted husband . That night he was undressing for bed when she moved over in the bunk and pushed the covers aside for him expectantly . He gave the inviting space a sidelong regard then finally looked away . " I 'd better not sleep in the bunk anymore , " he said . He glanced at her , saw her confused frown and cleared his throat . " It 's warmer weather now and we need not share the heat , and I  --  ah  --  I 've been concerned that I  --  in my sleep  --  might roll upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more room for you without me . " And in clumsy haste , he swung into the hammock and settled himself to take the rest he sorely needed . With lower lip thrust out in a petulant pout , Heather fluffed the quilts , gave him a last sidelong glare , turned her back and pulled the cover close about her neck . The days grew into weeks and after making their turn at Grand Banks the weather began to warm as they sailed further south with the strong northerly breezes behind them hastening their journey . Under the ever warming sun the natural color returned to Heather 's cheeks and all signs of illness faded away . She bloomed more beautiful than any flower , and to look at her one could surmise motherhood definitelyagreed with her . Whenever she was about on quarter-deck , close under Brandon 's hand , every man 's eyes were drawn to her at onep180time or another , and with the wind whipping her cloak about her and11 teasing a stray lock of hair she was something to behold . But never was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anything but the finest of ladies , and her delicate condition brought about many helping hands when she climbed to the quarter-deck . The new sleeping arrangements seemed to agree with Brandon . His eyes dropped the signs of strain . His face no longer appeared gaunt , and the shadows faded from beneath his eyes . His skin darkened underthe sun and wind and turned a deep coppery brown , and Heather , being very much a woman , found herself watching him more and more . They were nearing Bermuda and soon would be expecting to make a landfall on the island when a rain storm drenched them , and Brandon came up to the quarter-deck to find that George had lashed an empty barrel in the corner of the rail and was rigging a large piece of sail to funnel water into it . " George , might you be going mad , man ? " . Brandon quested , shoutingover the pounding of the rain . " What the hell are you doing withthat up here . " Th e servant came to attention and squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , sir . I thought she would be liking a bath what she could enjoy . Fresh rain water will be a relief from the salt , cap'n . " Brandon looked at the barrel with a critical eye and George rubbed his feet together in agony as he waited , hoping his captain would not order it from the quarter-deck . Brandon turned his gaze on the servant , then moved it again to the rain barrel and slowly back to George . His cold scrutiny held his man for several seconds , then aneyebrow raised and a half smile softened his face . " Sometimes , George , you amaze me , " he said , and strode off the quarter-deck . George heaved a sigh of relief and whistling to himself , rechecked the lashing . Heather eased herself into the warm water , taking great delight as the delicious heat crept up her body . Brandon sat at his desk , completelydistracted by her hurried disrobing upon discovering the steaming tub . George had discreetly prepared it while she was on deck taking a breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealed with delight and kissed the old man upon his pate , and the servant had fled from the cabin , blushing in pleased embarrassment.  |p181She  breathed a great sigh and lay her head back against the rim of the tub . She dipped her arms into the water then lifted them up , letting the sweet fluid cascade over her shoulders . Brandon swore beneath his breath as he totaled a column of figures incorrectly for the eighth time . His wife was completely engrossed in her delightful interludeand missed his silently mouthed curse . He thrust the quill into its well as if this might relieve his agitation and closed the ledger . He rose from the desk to pace about the room and gaze out the windows upon the moonlit sea in an effort to redirect his attention to something less frustrating . He failed abjectedly , and found himself gazing down upon his wife , watching her breasts tease the water as she bathed . He ran his finger lightly around her ear and brushed the nape of her neck with his knuckles . She turned liquid eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Brandon groaned and gritted his teeth and withdrew to a safer sector of the cabin . And having grown accustomed to his unreliable moods , Heather ignored his plight and continued with her bath , unconcerned . " Brandon , " she sweetly plied to his ignoring back . " Will you pass that bucket of water from the stove ? " He turned eagerly , relieved to have some task to occupy his mind . He poured the water into the foot of the tub and stood clumsily holding the pail as he watched her luxuriate in this new warmth . She sank her shoulders beneath the water then rose again with rosy breasts agleam as if with a morning dew . Brandon turned abruptly , mumbled something about fetching more water , and retreated from this torture chamber . Heather lay relaxing in the tub , almost purring with her contentment . She dribbled water from the sponge across her knees and splashed it on her face . The water seemed as satin against her skin , and she luxuriated in the feel of it , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above drew her attention and for a long while she listened to the footfalls pacing back and forth across the quarter-deck . She recognized them as Brandon 's and each time his shadow fell upon the small skylight above as he passed in front of a lantern hung alight on the quarter-deck , she wondered if he was impatient to be off the ship and at his home . Her bath concluded and the water emptied from the tub , she sat now before the stove in a nightgown , the quilt she had wrapped about her having fallen away as she brushed her hair . She was still at thisp182task when her husband returned , and she smiled warmly at him as he entered . Seeing her thus Brandon paused at the door in indecision . The dainty night garment was like a hazy cloud over her body , holding little from his regard . Her round breasts swelled generously over the top of the gown , and seeing their softly veiled peaks , he was again at odds with himself , not knowing how to keep himself from staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding its small space even more confining than usual . He ceased his agitated pacing by her sea chest and noticed her robe lying across it . He stared for a moment at its deep red hue and touched the soft velvet fabric , his fingers casually caressing it as if it held her within its folds . Suddenly he realized what he was doing , and stopped , muttering an oath . He took up the garmentand went to her and spread it about her shoulders . She smiled up at him again , murmuring her thanks , but made no move to put her arms through the sleeves or pull it closed . He waited , chafing at her delay at doing so , and finally bent and drew it together himself . " Heather , for God 's sake , " he groaned , " I 'm not a suckling babe to think nothing of your scanty attire . I 'm a man and I can not bear to see you so displayed . " Obediently she slid into her wrapper and fastened it snugly about her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled . As they neared Bermuda , Brandon grew restive and constantly rechecked his navigation . He and MacTavish compared notes and knew approximately when they would arrive , but neither would say a word for fear of being wrong . It was a week into December and the men discussed whether they would make port before Christmas . The two ships that had departed before them were due to dock around the New Year . If the Fleetwood could make Charleston before they did , she 'd be the first ship from England in several months and her cargo would bring a high profit . The crew knew that Bermuda was not more than twelve days out , thus the islands would bring the end of the voyage in sight . It was nearly noon the next day , the eighth of December , when a lookout 's voice rang from the top of the main mast . " Land ho ! Off the port bow . " From the deck nothing could be seen . Brandon glanced at his timepieceand made an entry in the log but held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the long awaited order to bring the ship about on the last leg home . The Fleetwood bucked and heaved to the new course and seemed top183strain forward as the men leaped into the rigging and spread her last inch of sail to catch the gentle southern breezes . One week before Christmas , after more than a month and a half at sea , they entered Charleston Bay . At sight of land they had hoisted signals , giving the word that the Fleetwood was coming into port , and Heather wrapped a cloak about herself and came up to have her first glimpse of this new land . Her first sight of the continent was a blue haze on the horizon and she had to squint to identify it as land at all . As they drew closer and could finally pick out features of the coast , it was apparent that they had made landfall some miles north of Charleston Bay and Brandon brought the ship several points aport to correct . This brought them angling down the coastline to the main channel and Heather viewed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the books she had read and the people she had listened to she had formed a mental picture of a rather dingy settlementsquatting in the midst of a steaming coastal swamp . She stood amazed at the clear blue water curling beneath the bow of the ship and the white sandy beaches stretching for miles . Beyond them stood great forests of mangrove and cypress , cottonwood and live oak , marching for endless leagues into the distance . When they finally rounded the point and entered the bay , she gasped at the sultry beauty of the whitewashedcity sprawling before her like a handful of white pearls on the sunlit beach . A log fort on a small sand island swept by the port beam and sails were taken in and other preparations made to warp the ship into her berth . As the Fleetwood dashed the last mile home , Heather saw that a large crowd had formed on the dock , and almost with a start she realized that in that throng were Brandon 's brother , his friends , and  --  his fiancee . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , and she fled below to make herself as presentable as she thought fitting for a captain 's wife . She dressed carefully , donning a pink wool gown and a highwaisted coat of the same hue , cut on the fashion of the Hussars and trimmed with silk braid and frogs . Her apprehension grew as she worried with her hair and finally coiled it about her head and stuffed it beneath a dark mink hat . At last she was ready , and with nothing else to do she sat in the familiar chair by the now cold stove and stared into the gloom of the cabin , her hands gripped tightly in her fur muff . Fear ran with spiked hooves across her nerves , and her composure became a matter of sheer will . She felt the ship grind against the dock and some moments later started when Brandon opened the door and entered the cabin . His eyes passed over her , **30;14109;TOOLONG the solitude of his hotel . Besides , the distant cries of Harry 's infant twin sons annoyed Joseph . Liza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was interested in her offspring and would interrupt Joseph and Harry , when they were in her house , by triumphantlybringing the squalling little boys into Harry 's " study . " Even Harry , the perpetually good-natured , would have to order her to leave , which made her cry . Joseph liked Liza and remembered her days of brutality in Mr. Healey 's house . But she was now comparatively rich , and had nursemaids , and the intrusion was unpardonable . " Why do n't you get married ? " Harry Zeff asked his friend . The very thought was repugnant to Joseph . His old habit of consideringhis sister and his brother intruded on him . " I have seen no woman as yet , " he said , " that I would want to marry . " He thought of Katherine Hennessey . Then Harry said , watching him , " You are a multimillionaire now , Joe . Who is going to get your money ? Your sister ? She will probably marry , herself . Your brother  --  " And Harry paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard . Then , what would he do ? Would Harvard make a responsible man of him , serious , determined to succeed ? Would it change his character , make it resolute and strong ? Joseph thought , and he was appalled . He knew that men never changed their nature . The three Armaghs moved into their new house , which now containedits full staff of servants , and were accompanied by Regina 's governess , a young lady who had been rigorously convent-trained , and Sean 's tutor . ( The latter had been chosen from applicants in Boston , a young man named Timothy Dineen , whom Joseph had liked for his serious appearance , his maturity , and his firm understanding of what was important in life , such as fortitude , courage , intelligence , learning , and manliness . Joseph hoped that Timothy would impart some of his principles to Sean but so far the result had not been one for enthu-siasm . ) Sister Elizabeth had selected Regina 's governess , a Miss Kathleen Faulk , whose mother was known to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Joseph had told the young woman and Timothy from the start . " Keep your holy water , your medals , your crucifixes , your pious literature and your holy pictures , in your own quarters , and do not intrude them elsewhere . "  |p301Timothy  , who was fearless , and several years younger than Joseph , said , " Mr. Armagh , may I enquire , then , why you chose Catholics for your sister and your brother ? " In spite of himself Joseph gave his hard-lipped smile . " I do n't want them to be out of their element  --  yet . It might confuse them . As for Miss Regina , she is very religious and I never interfere with one 's religion . It would make her unhappy to deprive her of what she has always known . Sean  --  there is muscle in your religion , Mr. Dineen , as well as sentimentality and statues in sickly colors . Endurance . Fearlessness . Respect for authority and education . Masculinity . Awareness of living . Strength . I 've known many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own mouth still . " They had what we call fortitude , and faced a Sassenagh with a gun with nothing but their breviaries in their own hands and shouted him down for the sake of a child or a helpless woman . " Again he paused , remembering , and the dark Celtic gloom deepened on his face and the younger man felt a confused pity . " So , " said Joseph , " try to put some steel into the backbone of your pupil , Mr. Dineen , and make him a little worthy of the brave men who died for him . " Such as yourself , poor devil , thought young Timothy , who had had the good fortune to be born " lace-curtain " Irish , and whose grandfather had come to America long before the Famine and with a sturdy trade in his hands . Miss Kathleen Faulk was a pallid fair young woman , very thin but durable , with a large nose and light eyes and an air of competence . She was very tall , much taller than Timothy Dineen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , obvious muscles and vitality and health , and very deep black eyes and a rolling mass of black hair . He looked like a pugilist , rather than a scholar , and had been taught by the Jesuits and had few illusions left , as he would remark . He wore spectacles on his snubbed nose and his mouth was strong and pink and a little inflexible . Miss Faulk , who earnestly desired to be married , had considered Timothy at once , even though his head did come only to the height of her nostrils , but he continued to show no interest . Now horses were quartered in the stables , and carriages , traps and buggies , all of the best quality , and exotic plants were already blooming , this chill November day , in the glass conservatories , and warm fires burned on brown , blue , white , rose , and purplish marble hearths all over the big bright house . Joseph had ordered that the servants ' quartersunder the eaves be made as comfortable and pleasant as possible , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theyp302marveled and were happy and did all they could to please the somber Master on his return from his affairs in Titusville , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Boston , New York , and in other cities . ' We must have a party ! " said Sean to his sister after they had been installed in their new house for a month and the first snow was falling . " We must ask Joe , " said Regina . " Joe ? " said Sean . " You know what he would say , Ginny . No . " " He knows we ca n't live alone , " said the girl . " He has told me to make friends . I know a lot of the girls in the convent . They would be so pleased to be invited here , with a few of the Sisters . " Sean was aghast . " That ugly mass of tatterdemalions ! Joe would give the back of his hand to them , and so would I. I never want to think of that orphanage again . Ginny , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I never could stand them . Their very presence here would depress me beyond describing . " Regina was horrified . She knew that Sean shrank from the sight of suffering , and everything morbid and wretched and unbeautiful , but she had endured the same deprivations and the same unlovely scenes , and thought of the orphanage , now , with compassion and sadness and a hope that she might be able to persuade Joseph to make life there brighter and more bearable . " They would remind me , " said Sean , with real distress , " of all those terrible years we had to spend there , for no fault of our own . And we waited , and waited , all that time , for Joe to keep his promise . I had just about given up hope  --  He could have done it sooner . " He tossed back his golden hair in a gesture of remembered misery and resentment . " He must have wasted a lot of time . He could have done it sooner . " " He could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you be so cruel , Sean ? Sister Elizabeth has told me what Joe suffered , and how he worked for us  --  " She could not continue for fear of bursting out crying . For one of the rare times in her tranquil life she felt the sharp edge of uncontrollable anger and indignation . " Very well , " said Sean . " I am grateful , and you know it , Ginny , and I do n't like the peculiar way you are staring at me now . It is just that I can not even endure the very thought of those  --  people . The orphanage . Our party must be made up of better specimens . " " Richer , more fortunate , perhaps ? " said Regina and her young voice held its first bitterness , its first contempt , and Sean looked at her uneasilyand wondered what had happened to his benign and thoughtful sister and her understanding . Regina thought : I believed that Sean had the kindest and tenderestp303of hearts , and perhaps he has though I do n't know any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear the sight of ugliness or pain or despair , not out of cruelty or hardness but out of a fear of them and because they offend his eye . Sean said , " Very well , Ginny , I 'm sorry I hurt your feelings . But I ca n't help what I feel , dear . I never want even to think of that orphanageagain , where we were caged like beasts . " His melodious voice rose passionately . " Ca n't you understand , Ginny ? I do n't care about new friends being richer or more fortunate , as you called them . I just want to know people who are different from those we have known . Is that so heartless , so incomprehensible ? " Regina bent her head and a long black curtain of her hair fell over her face and half hid it . " I will ask Joe , " she said . She stood up and left the luxurious breakfast room where she and Sean had been eating , and Sean watched her go , hurt and somewhat perplexed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had always thought of Reginaas a young princess , tall and stately and serene , always ready with a look or touch of sympathy , always gazing at her brother with great dark blue eyes which swam with radiance and affection . Now , he thought , it is always Joe , Joe , Joe , as if he were a member of the Trinity , Itself , instead of a rough brute of a man without any of the amenities and with the face of a boulder that has stared at the sky relentlessly for ages . He always frightened me half to death , even at his best . No finer feelings , no subtleties , no eye except for money , money , money . Sean absently fingered the goldpieces in his own pocket and forgot who had given them to him . Sighing , he went into one of the noble parlors  --  now called the music room  --  and sat down at the piano and played to console himself and ease the misery of his own dejection . Soon the delectable notes of Debussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sparkled in the air and sang like fountains in the sun . Finally , feeling much happier , Sean 's fingers rippled gayly on the board and he threw back his head and sang joyously , hardly conscious of the words but only of the music : " They 're hanging men and women for the wearing of the Green ! " He heard a cough and looked up , smiling , to see Timothy Dineen standing near him . His hands fell from the keys . " Pretty song , is n't it ? " asked Timothy . Sean began to laugh his light laugh but something in Timothy 's face startled him , and again he was baffled . Everyone was very strange this morning.  | " I had two uncles who were hanged , and a young aunt , " said Timothy , " for that very wearing of the green , ' in Ireland . Somehow , I do n't find it very amusing . " " For God 's sake ! " cried Sean . " I was just singing ! Does n't a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the newly falling snow through the velvet-draped windows . " I do n't think your brother would like to hear that song sung so merrily , either , " he said . " But come along . You are already half an hour late for your studies . " His black eyes contemplated Sean without kindness , and then he turned and went out . Katherine Hennessey walked slowly and with considerable feeblenessacross the vast and whitely shining hall of her house . From large arched windows draped in lace and velvet on each side of the huge bronze doors the lucid light of early morning poured into the hall , and there was softer light streaming down the enormous marble stairs which led to upper floors . Sofas and love seats in rose and gold and blue lined the white-paneled walls , which were traced in silver , and upon orange plants and other exotic flora in their Chinese pots . The air was warm and silky , for this was the middle of May , and the scent of flowering gardens and shrubs and red-bud trees had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees lifted their leaves , and they were so young that they appeared wet with gleaming water , and they stirred and glittered in the sun . A profound and tremulous hope had come to Katherine Hennessey recently , for her husband would run for Governor of the Commonwealthin November , and he would be at home more often , perhaps every weekend and at every holiday , and several consecutive weeks in the year . She had hated Washington and its mud and its teeming people and its predatory politicians , and its dank streets ugly to her , for all their width , and the blank Circles and the ostentatiously large governmentbuildings , and the stench of its Negro slums , and its sewers . The climate had made her ill . The Potomac , to her , was a sluggish and filthy and noxious stream , often covered with fog , and now , to her , the city was a tomb for she still mourned Mr. Lincoln . The houses , the majority of them , had seemed crowded and unattractive , and thep305wooden and brick walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimy . She was quite convinced that Washington had put its own disgusting mark on her husband  --  poor Tom  --  and had wearied him to death , and had separated him from his family because of endless and devoted duties . Even in summer , that most awful and impossible summer of Washington , he had had to remain in Washington , toiling for the welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the whole nation , enduring the sodden heat , the stinks , the almost tropical rains and storms , and the pervading mud . Now he would come home . When in Philadelphia  --  she did not doubt that a grateful Commonwealth would elect him  --  he would be very near . Perhaps they could have a small house there where she could be with him . He was not young any longer . He was in his late fifties . Here her sorrowful mind would become darkly shiftingand confused . In Washington , there had been so many Temptationsfrom Unscrupulous Adventuresses , all preying on defenseless politicians so far from home  --  so lonely  --  so homesick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to hold fast and love and understand , and forgive . One must always console herself that she was the Wife , the Chosen , and must think as little as possible no matter when grief assaulted her and shame and humiliation , and not imagine herselfan actual object of contempt , despised , rejected . One must concealTears . Katherine was often stringent and harsh in her thoughts of herself . She had frequently , when her pain was too great , gently upbraidedher husband , and had wept , and had forgotten that Gentlemendetested tears and fled from them , and that they deserved more consideration from their wives . Since Senator Hennessey had announced that he was the candidate of his party for the office of governor in the autumn  --  explaining in luscious tones and with trembling inflections that he wished to be more with his beloved family  --  Katherine had bewitched herself with the delusionthat all she had ever suspected , all she had ever known , of her husband , had been the fantasies of her own hard and obdurate heart , her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dear Tom have given up his labors in Washington as a prominentand popular senator , if not for the desire to return more frequentlyto the bosom of his family ? She had been wrong , wrong , wrong , and wicked and full of evil imaginings , and she spent hours on her knees at home and in church praying for forgiveness and doing penance . She only hoped , humbly , that Tom would forgive her if not soon then before she died . She had appealed to her confessor to inflictp306more penances on her , and he had looked at her with compassion , and very strangely , and had often lifted her when she had thrown herselfat his feet , and had held her shaking gloved hands while thinkingthoughts which were not priestly but very much the anger of a knowledgeable man . What did even a priest say to an innocent woman who confessed sins of which she was not guilty ? How console her , uplifther ? He had finally said , knowing it was the truth but in some way a sophistry on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that no one had any merit of his own but only that given to him by the merciful Father , and that peace lay in the knowledge of forgiveness and confession . Sometimes he thought Katherine excessively scrupulous , and had once chided her on this , but her insistence on her sins silenced him . However he had marveled at the besottedness of a woman 's devotion to a man so unworthy of any devotion at all , so splendidly vicious , so magnificently and triumphantly wicked and exigent . But love , the priest remembered , was greater than faith and hope , and forgave all things , endured all things , excused all things  --  and finally blamed itself for the evil of others . If women , thought the priest , would love God as passionately as they loved their betrayers then indeedsome Grace might come to this terrible world as she walked slowly and with a slight panting difficulty across the marble to the bronze doors , dearest Tom would be home for his darling daughter 's seventeenth birthday celebration . She smiled fondly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Seventeen . She , herself , had been a wife and mother just before her seventeenth birthday , but young ladies these days were more independent and saucy and had strong minds . Darling Bernadette ! She was willful and not always respectful to her elders , but she had such a spirit , such a liveliness , such a way of tossing her long sleek brown curls , such a sparkle of brilliant defiance in her eyes , that one forgave her on the spot . No wonder dear Tom loved his daughter so much . At her age he must have been her masculine replica , and Katherinepondered , with love , on the young Tom she had never known but whom she cherished in Bernadette . I am , thought Katherine , as she pantingly pulled open the bronze door , unworthily blessed . She was amused at her weakness . I am an old woman , she thought . I am going on thirty-four . That is young no longer . I am beginning to feel the infirmities of age . I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sakes . She was going to stroll on the lawns and among the gardens , as herp307doctor had recommended . She had dutifully taken her iron pills this morning . She had forced herself , as her doctor had ordered , " to partake of Sufficient Nourishment to Invigorate the System and the Frame . " But she had become disgustingly and violently ill  --  as usual  --  and this caused her fresh feelings of dismay and guilt . So she had again forced herself to drink some milk , weeping , and eat some toast , and to take her pills . Neither she nor her doctor ever once suspected that her suppressedknowledge of the shame , brutality , betrayal , rejection , contempt , and humiliation she had endured since her marriage , and the endless exploitation , had destroyed her health and endurance for all time . She was at last able to open the heavy door far enough to let her out . She did not know that young Bernadette had come halfway down the stairs to the hall while she had been feebly making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mixture of disdain and cynicismand wondering and contemptuous pity . Mama was such a fool , such an old-fashioned elderly woman , such , really , an imbecile . She knew nothing at all about Papa , whom Bernadette loved very much . ( She had little affection for her mother , who was so weak and soft and stupid , so determinedly deluded , so devoted , so gentle , so forbearing , so spiritless , so anxious to run , at any time of the day or the night , to alleviate someone 's distress or hunger or homelessness  --  even if the person was a stranger . She wasted so much money on that miserable orphanage , and other charities , money which she was spending from what would eventually be her daughter 's estate . Bernadette often felt outrage over this , and indignation . So did her father , who agreed with her . ) Bernadette went to one of the windows beside the doors and watched her mother 's piteously thin and fragile figure moving with slow difficultyacross the lawns . The girl shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light blue silk frock , with the new big bustle behind and the draped front  --  all pearls and embroidery  --  and she looked like a ridiculous skeleton in it , her feet fumbling under the hem for balance . Katherine 's mass of tawny natural waves and ringlets had been caught up in a huge chignon on her delicate head , and Bernadetteagain felt resentment that her own hair was straight and shining brown and lank , and had to be put up in rags every night to achieve the long fall of sleek tubes which hung down her plump back . For Bernadette was plump though " pleasingly so , no mere bag of bones , " as her father frequently assured her , with a glance at Katherine , who was tall and so desperately frail and thin . Certainly Bernadettep308had a rounded and mature figure at seventeen , a full and thrusting breast , wide hips , and glossy dimpled arms and legs . Her skin , unlike Katherine 's , was faintly golden , another exasperation for it suggested a vulgar exposure to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel eyes , always sparkling , with short brown lashes , were still another vexation , for her mother had , Bernadette confessed , the most beautiful and changeful eyes she had ever seen , and her father 's were light and interesting . Bernadette 's face was round  --  " like a bun , " a disrespectful governess had once said  --  and a little flat in profile , with a small tilted nose , lips too large and red , teeth too large and white , and a chin too aggressive for a woman . The girl , clad in a morning frock of yellow linen sprigged with tiny roses , fashionably bustled and draped with a moderate simplicity , gave her an air of sprightliness , lively motion , vitality and exuberance , as she watched her mother 's progress over the lawns . Now the silly thing was talking to a stable boy , with that deep seriousness and that deep kind smile she always wore when speaking to anybody . Could n't she ever see how absurd she was , gazing at people like an illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter and gayer women ! After all , a man can stand so much of a fool , and then he must console himself . Bernadette had not been appalled at the giggling revelations of her schoolmates at St. Amelia 's Female Academy in Philadelphia which concerned her father . In many ways , secretly , she was proud of her father 's virility and manifest masculinity . At least he was a man , and not a caricature of a woman as her mother was . Bernadette was not deceived that her father was seeking the governorship to be " with my beloved family more often . " She knew very well , from reading hints in the newspapers , that Papa was about finished in Washington , and that the State Legislature was no longer in a mood to reappoint him once again . Papa had been entirely too zestful in Washington , though Bernadette never condemned him . She thought him delightful , and justified . She had her father 's own exigency , his expedient way of managing things to his advantage , his own gusto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconcern for others , his own absence of illusion , and his own cynicism . She also had his charm , which she used deliberately , and was usually laughing saucily or uttering an impertinent witticism , and she had such perfect health that that health alone drew people to her , forgiving her sallies , her impudence , her arrogant ways . The Sisters at her school had often deplored " dear Bernadette 's irreverence , " but had loved her , as a whole state had loved her father.  |p309Bernadette  , still watching her mother , impatiently pushed aside a strand of her overly fine hair from her forehead  --  which was too low , too rounded , and freckled . Now what was Mama doing , for Heaven 's sake ? Katherine , just joined by a gardener 's boy , was bending and seriouslyinspecting the early roses in a flower bed , and from her slight gestures and her expression , she was being gently earnest . Her waist is like a stick , thought Bernadette . She has no bosom , no hips . Her complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long abandoned it except for the deep rose of her mouth . Her hair shimmeredlike dark gold in the sun , and she was now absently pushing a curling tendril behind one of her ears as she listened to the boy . HerJ dress was too elaborate for the morning , Bernadette reflected . But she was always dressed as if about to receive guests  --  and at this hour , too ! The light warm breeze was lifting some of the ringlets and waves on Katherine 's head and Bernadette thought , with envy , that she , herself , tried to avoid breezes which could unfurl those careful long tubes of brown hair which hung down her back and make them lank and stringy . Mama never wore snoods . Tomorrow , she , Bernadette , at seventeen , would insist on a snood for herself , which would control her hair and make her a mature lady . And she was damned if she was ever going back to St. Amelia 's Female Academy ! She had had enough of that . She thought of herself , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , at dinners and soirees and balls . Later , she would have a husband . She was old enough for marriage , for God 's sake . She had a man in mind , and all at once her young strong body was hot and trembling . The man she really desperately loved and desired was Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh , the brother of a girl she tolerated and cultivated assiduouslyonly for one reason . Mary Regina was almost as silly as Mama  --  and Bernadette resented and envied the other girl 's beauty . Regina was sent to no female academy . Her brother kept her at home with a governess to teach her graces and manners , and Timothy Dineen to educate her . Bernadette had long ago discerned Joseph 's deep attachmentto his sister , and so Bernadette had pursued that sister relentlessly , with sweetness , sometimes even with fawnings , and always with loudly expressed affection and devotion . Regina , who had no love for lavish parties , always accepted Bemadette 's invitations , and she had made some friends of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as intelligent . It was not Joseph 's wealth alone which had early attracted the nubile Bernadette , but his very appearance , his air of assurance and power andp310distinction , his look of ruthlessness , of cold dominance . Sean was like a waving blossom compared with an oak , and Bernadette despised Sean , who was now in Harvard and not doing excellently . ( Bernadette knew almost to the penny how much money it had cost Joseph to get Sean admitted to Harvard . Her father had chuckled about it . " They never want the Irish , " he had said , " except for  --  " And he had rubbed his fingers knowingly together . " Especially not Irish born in Ireland . " To Bernadette , second generation American-Irish , the Irishbornwere greenhorns and rude and uncouth , except for Joseph Ar-magh . ) Bernadette had hinted of her attachment to Joseph a year ago , and her father had laughed . " You could do worse , my pet , " he had said . " He has even more money than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many companies , and is no fool , and has a lot of pride , and will go very far , and is deeply involved in politics  --  I am relying on his support , I must confess , in his newspaper , the Philadelphia Messenger , which has great influence . He will never run for anything , himself  --  one must remember his  --  er  --  his  --  " Tom had paused . One did n't mention brothels to one 's daughter . He continued , " With his connections . Some of them not quite gentlemanly . Well , we 'll see , later . " It was now " later , " in Bernadette 's opinion . Mama had been a wife and mother at seventeen . Why , thought Bernadette , I am almost an old maid ! I 'm not even remotely bespoken . Who wants callow boys , anyway , instead of a man like Joe , who is just like Papa ? Bernadette remembered , with pleasure , that Papa would be coming home tonight for her party . The servants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering house . The lanterns would be hung in the gardens . If the weather remained fair there would be a wooden platform on the back lawns for the musicians and the dancing . There was already a humming and a stir in the servants ' quarters and in the kitchen . There would be awnings and tents and candlelight and singing . School friends from Philadelphia were due this afternoon with their chaperones or their Mamas , and every girl who was anybody in Winfield and Green Hills had been invited . Bernadette thought of her gown , which she had selected herself  --  one of Worth 's most beautiful  --  in New York . It was white satin of a richness like velvet , with loops of tiny silk red roses over the narrow skirt , and roses gathered under the new bustle in the back , and a bodice voluptuously cut to reveal her full golden breasts , and with diamonte tiny buttons , and little flounced sleeves just covering the shoulders . It had been artfully styled to reveal Bernadette 's attractions and to conceal her plumpness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Her father 's gift would be a necklace of fine matched pearls , and her mother 's a beautiful diamond bracelet . She would wear long white kid gloves , and roses in her hair . She would be irresistible . To Joseph Armagh . Of course , he was the oldest young man to be invited to the party , and he would accompany that foolish Regina . The rest would be " boys , " as Mama thought fitting . Polite , nervous " boys " with clammy gloved hands , and some with pimples . Mama really had no sense . She , herself , had married a man old enough to be her father , and she had murmuredsomething about Joseph 's " age . " Thirteen years difference ! How ridiculous . This was strange , too , for Mama was much attached to Joseph , thank God . Bernadette was the only one who suspected this , for her disillusioned eyes saw almost everything . But they had not detected Joseph 's powerful and unshakable love for her mother . They saw only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a slight overt tenderness . Naturally , he would give all this to a woman of Mama 's age , though Mama was only two or three years or so older than he . But men were different from women . Bernadette had almost persuaded herself that Joseph 's attentions to her mother , so unnaturally gentle , were for her sake . The girl , ardently pursued by young men even from Boston and New York  --  brothers of her schoolmates  --  and young men from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Winfield  --  had no doubt but that she need only lift a finger and Joseph would fall at her feet . She intended to lift that finger tomorrow . She knew that she amused Joseph with her pertness and her witticisms , which sometimes bordered on his own irony , and that he believedshe loved his sister devotedly . She had guessed that at times her effrontery amused him even more , and her liveliness and vitality . With him she was also artless , laughing , coy and flirtatious . She was also , she remembered acutely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father was a senator , and he would be governor , and the family had social power in Washington and all over the Commonwealth , and were established  --  as Joseph 's family was not . " Shanty " Irish , Tom Hennessey had once said with indulgence , not knowing that Joseph had applied that term to him on many occasions . " But a good mind , for all that , and some amenities and manners and conduct . " He would have preferred that Bernadette had desired Sean , nearer her own age , and very Anglo-Saxon in appearance . " One would never guess he was Irish . "  |p312She  would advance an idea to her father tonight : She wanted to be tutored by Timothy Dineen , too . " He has taught Regina twice as much as I have learned in Philadelphia . It is only a step for me to the Armaghs ' house , and you know how dearly I love Regina , and I would be among my closest friends in Green Hills . " She would then encounter Joseph more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed tomorrow . But , how could it fail ? Who was he , compared with Bernadette Hennessey , in establishment ? She loved him , she told herself with virtue , despite what he was . Such pure love must surely be returned . Besides , her house was far more grand , and she had a lady for a mother . It would have amused and amazed Bernadette to know that her mother had guessed , even two years ago , that her daughter was infatuatedwith Joseph Armagh , and that she considered her daughter tender and loving and single-hearted . ( She , like Bernadette , thought all the deference , consideration and courtliness extended to her by Joseph was because of a reserved and growing attachment to Bernadette . ) Once she had said to her daughter , " Joseph is so strong and dependable and such a gentleman , " and she had watched Bernadette 's suddenly flushingface with love and understanding . She also thought Bernadette , the dear child , so shy and so young , in spite of the flippancy and the impertinence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Sisters . Bernadette could be difficult , Katherine admitted , but that was the fault of her youth which time would ameliorate , and in the meantime her mother must exercise restraint and be indulgent . She could conceive of no man more worthy of her darling than Joseph . Now , what the hell is she doing ? thought Bernadette , watching her mother through the window . Oh , how ridiculous ! For the gardener 's boy had picked a white rosebud and was tenderingit to Katherine with an awkward bow . Katherine looked at him , smiling . Then she took the rosebud and tucked it in her bodice and was obviously thanking the bumpkin . She bent her beautiful head and sniffed at the rosebud . I should n't wonder but that there are tears in her silly eyes , thought Bernadette , highly diverted . But what presumptuousness . I must tell Papa tonight , and how he will laugh  --  a greenhornand her old mother , bowing and smiling and scraping to each other . Bernadette was suddenly cross . Had her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always kissing and hugging the ugliest and most snot-nosed brats at the orphanage , and bringing them gifts . She must have some common blood , thought Bernadette.  |p313Then  the girl 's attention was caught by something moving briskly through the gates on the graveled road and towards the house . In a moment or two Bernadette saw that it was one of the better hacks of the depot , and that it contained a young lady . Bernadette thought that the woman was probably the mother or the chaperone of one of her own guests due tonight . But where was the guest ? Bernadette opened the bronze doors and walked out upon the white steps of the pillared portico . The lady , assisted by the driver , alighted on the path and Bernadette saw that she was very beautiful and young , and not more than twentyone , and arrayed lavishly in lavender silk and lace , and that she had marvelous slender ankles and a mass of pale hair under her little tilted hat . Her features , Bernadette could see even from this distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gloves were lavender and so was her silk coat and parasol . She was extremely soignee and stylish and her figure was lovely in all its proportions , and she was tall . Though she had a controlled air , and was apparently of excellent breeding , there was something agitated about her , and the inquisitive Bernadettewas surprised . Katherine , equally surprised , left the flower bed and went to the stranger , making a soft , self-deprecating gesture with her thin hands . She then motioned towards the house , but the lady  --  who was regarding Katherine with earnest attention  --  shook her head slightly . Katherine paused , as if a little baffled . Bernadette could hear their voices , though not their words . Then Katherine was no longer speaking ; the wind caught her blue dress and it was as if it had touched the shroud of a dead woman . Bernadette wanted to run to join them but manners had been literally beaten into her by the Sisters , and so she cautiously advancedonly to the steps of the portico and strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bernadette saw that her mother was very still , only her blue dress and her hair blowing a little , and that she was , suddenly , dwindled and shrunken in appearance . The young lady 's voice rose desperately . " I implore you , Mrs. Hennessey , to be merciful and kind ! To understand , to remember that I am a sister-woman in a terrible situation . Not to judge me , or your husband , but only to be kind and compassionate . It was probablymost wrong of us  --  I know it was , and we are guilty , and from my heart I ask your pardon , and even your pity , for one so much younger than yourself . You have a daughter . Consider me as a daughter , too , who comes to you in wretchedness not only pleading for forgiveness , but asking your help . "  |p314Then  Katherine spoke in a dry and almost inaudible voice : " But  --  what did he tell you , about me , about himself ? " She put her hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was running with tears as she leaned towards Katherine . " Only what you know yourself , Mrs. Hennessey , that he intends to leave you when he is elected governor , and that he has asked you for a divorce and you have refused , in spite of my dire situation and my helpless position . Is it possible that you will continue to deny our child his father 's name , you who are a mother , yourself ? Could any human being be so cruel ? I do n't believe it , your face is so gentle , so  --  tender . Tom must have been mistaken . He has told me that you will not let him go , because you want his money , and that you never loved each other , and it was a marriage of convenience , which he has always regretted . But surely you know this , yourself ! He prefers , as he has told you , that you sue for the divorce , but , if not , he will be forced to do so , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unborn child to consider . Mrs. Hennessey , I appeal to your womanly heart , your pity , to let him go at once ! He does not know I have come to you , but I was driven  --  I wanted to appeal  --  " Katherine rocked vaguely on her heels . She put her hand to her face , as if in bemused wonder , a dream , in incredulity . Her fragile body swayed . Bernadette started down the stairs , only half comprehending . Then Katherine turned , very , very slowly , her hands fumbling helplesslyin the air , and she faced the house and took two uncertain steps towards it , her white face blank and without any expression at all . She staggered . She threw up her arms as if drowning , and then she dropped to the shining green grass and lay there , tossed and thrown , a bundle of bodiless blue . The gardener 's boy ran to her , and Bernadette began to run . She reached her mother and stood beside her but did not bend or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady who was staring at Katherine , aghast , her hand to her lips . ' Who are you ? " she asked of the stranger , and the woman , still lookingonly at Katherine , said faintly , " I  --  I am a friend of the senator 's  --  a friend . He wants to leave his wife but she will not let him go . " She became aware of the young girl . She looked at Bernadette with stretched green eyes . " Who are you ? " she whispered . " I am the senator 's daughter , " said Bernadette . " And you are a liar . " When Joseph Armagh entered the great hall of the Hennessey house he saw that Bernadette , disheveled and weeping and swollen of face , was the only one there . The hall had been partially decorated , and thenp315deserted . There was utter silence in the enormous mansion , a sensation that death was already present . Bernadette , crying wildly , ran to Joseph and flung herself on his chest . His arms rose automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries with a stunned expression . He listened to her words , finally , with suddenly sharp attention . " She lied , she lied ! " Bernadette half-screamed . " She is an adventuress  --  my father  --  she lied . She killed my mother . I heard it all  --  " " Your mother sent for me , " said Joseph , still holding the girl , whose morning dress was crumpled and stained . Bernadette clung to him . " She lied ! My father would never do a thing like that  --  " Her voice became furious , then pleading , as she kept her head rigidly against Joseph 's chest . Joseph listened , and as he listenedhis Gaelic face darkened to bleakness and savagery . He stared over the girl 's head as if seeing something unpardonable , something too terrible to be true . The girl continued to pour out her desperate words , her gasping accusations , her defense of her father , her anguish over her mother , and Joseph , all at once , was aware of her youth , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the head that lay on his chest , and his face blackened more and more . " Hush , hush , " he said . " Where is your father ? " Bernadette shrieked , " She wo n't see him ! he does n't dare go into her room ! The priest is here  --  Extreme Unction  --  and the doctor 's with her ! To say such things about my father ! To think my mother believed them  --  Oh , my poor mother ! " The long tube-like curls had long ago lost their roundness . Bernadette 's fine lank hair swathed her like a brown veil , and numerous tendrils on her cheeks and forehead were wet with sweat and tears . Her face was not only swollen , but blotched with red , and she seemed almost beside herself with frenzy , rage and grief and hate . She took Joseph by the arms and shook him and looked at him with starting hazel eyes veined heavily with scarlet , and almost mad in appearance , and dripping . " My mother does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have him in her room . He wanted to go in , and she screamed  --  It was terrible . My poor father ! So many enemies  --  it is n't fair  --  you 've got to tell her  --  the doctor wo n't let him in . Oh , my God , Joseph , help me , help me , I do n't know what to do ! I  --  I went in , and she wanted to kiss and hold me  --  I could n't , I could n't  --  I was so afraid  --  " Joseph took his own handkerchief and wiped the girl 's streaming face and eyes and she sobbed brokenly and clutched him again and convulsively clung to him . He looked about for servants , for someonep316who would take this weeping child away and comfort her , but every door was shut . The gas chandelier had been lit . Its stark light shone down on the cold white marble of the hall . The stairs were empty . There was no sound . The pictures on the walls gazed at him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pots of little trees and plants seemed wilted . Joseph began to stroke Bernadette 's tangled hair gently and absently , and after a while Bernadette stopped screaming and only sobbed , huddling herself tightly against him . He had seen two carriages outside , but it was as if no one was here but himself and Bernadette . Then a discreet maid 's head slyly popped from behind a distant door and Joseph said , " Damn you ! Come here and help Miss Bernadette , you slut ! " The woman emerged , her eyes sliding , her tongue licking the corners of her lips . She touched her dry eyelids with her white apron . " I did n't want to intrude , sir , " she whined . Her face was full of that evil enjoyment which the inferior feel when the superior are in distress . She glanced at Bernadette without favor , and then she assumed a compassionateexpression and put her hand on the girl 's shoulder . " Come with me , Miss Bernadette , dear , do , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph and shook the woman 's hand from her and showed her teeth like a wolf . " Get away from me ! " she cried . " Get away ! " She seized Joseph again , looking up at him , frantic and distraught . " Do n't leave me , Joe , do n't leave me ! " Where was that bastard of a father of hers , that he was not with her to comfort and help her ? " I wo n't leave you , " he said . " But your mother sent for me , an hour ago . Where is your father ? " " In his room . I do n't know  --  in his room . 1lc ca n't stand it  --  he does n't know what to do  --  " I bet , thought Joseph , and he felt again that powerful urge to kill . He took Bernadette to a sofa and forced her to sit upon it . She dropped her head to her knees and her arms swung helplessly beside her head . He looked at the avidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Do n't leave her for a moment . " He paused . " Which is Mrs. Hennessey 's bedroom upstairs ? " With pity he looked down at Bernadette , so agonized , so broken , her arms swinging close to the floor , her long hair hanging about her , her face hidden , her voice keening lamentations and despair . " Second door to your left , on the floor above , " said the maid , and she approached Bernadette cautiously , as if fearing the girl would leap atp317her throat . She sat down on the edge of the sofa beside the girl and folded her hands in her apron and looked up at Joseph with total emptiness . Her face assumed a hypocritical expression and she sighed . The gaslight glared down pitilessly , and there was still no sound . Yet here was a house which had begun to prepare for a party . Who had sent the guests away ? How could there be such abandonment here ? Bernadette 's wailing sobs echoed through the vast hall . The rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does ? Joseph went to the wide marble staircase with its gilded bannister and it wound above him . He reached another wide long hall , the white floor partially covered with an Oriental runner ; landscapes , excellently painted , hung on the walls . Sofas lined one side . Heavy carved doors of polished wood stood shut before Joseph . At first he did not see Tom Hennessey sitting with his head in his hands on a love seat , the very portrait of despair , nor the priest beside him who looked only ahead as if the other man was not there at all . Here the light of the chandelier was not so vivid , and the hall wavered in half-shadow . When he finally saw the two men Joseph stopped and he looked at Tom Hennessey and a ball of fire and acid stuck in his throat and his vision jerked with the intensity of his hatred . The priest saw him and rose , a strong middle-aged man recently come to Winfield to the new St. Leo 's Church . He held out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are Mr. Armagh for whom Mrs. Hennessey is asking ? " " Yes , " said Joseph and shook hands with the priest . " How is Mrs. Hennessey ? " The priest glanced at the senator who cowered lower on his seat , and he said , " She has received the Last Rites . " His grave calm eyes studied Joseph . " It is not expected that she will  --  live . " He went before Joseph and opened a door and then stood aside . He had seen Joseph 's expression when he had looked at the senator and he had sighed inwardly . Joseph entered a dimly lit bedroom large and wide , with three arched windows draped in golden silk and with a white marblefireplace in which a small fire burned . It was a beautiful room , spaciousand silent , with only one gaslight burning on one wall , and turned low , and Joseph was aware of muted colors , green and rose and gray . In the center of the room stood a richly canopied bed , and in that bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat beside her and held his hand on her pulse . Her tawny hair was spread out on her white silken pillows like a glowing wave , and her white face was absolutely still , and she ap/peared already dead to Joseph as he slowly approached her . But she felt his presence . Her eyes , dulled now and empty , faintly brightened , and she whispered his name . He bent over her in silence and with a sick and ferocious sorrow , and she moved her free hand and he took it . It was as cold as death . He said , " I came , Katherine , " and it was the first time he had ever used her name and he said it not with restraint now but with all the power of his love for her . The faint brightness in her eyes increased . She turned her head to the doctor and whispered , " Alone , please . " The satin coverlet covered her to her throat , but she shivered in the warm air , her slight body hardly lifting the quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Joseph , and he murmured , " Only a minute or two . " There was a smell in the room of flowers and spirits of ammonia and some other acrid odor of useless medicines . The doctor left and Joseph knelt beside the bed , and Katherineheld his hand as if only he could keep her alive , and the iciness of her fingers recalled the touch of his dying mother . The little fire hissed and sparked and threw up reddish lights onto the hearth , and a summer wind hummed softly against the closed windows . Katherine 's dying face was the face of a girl , a suffering and tortured girl , and her lips were gray and her nose was pinched and the nostrils moved in and out as she tried for her last breaths . She did not look away from Joseph , whose head was so near hers , but her eyes probed into his earnestly , hopefully , pleadingly . " Yes ? " said Joseph . " Yes , dear . What is it ? " " Bernadette , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She loves you , Joseph , and I know you love her and that you have just been waiting to speak  --  " Her throat almost closed , and she panted and struggled , her chin jutting out . Joseph knelt very still beside the bed and looked at her and his hand tightened about hers to give her strength , to keep her for a while . Her words entered his mind slowly , and with only a dull astonishment . " Take her , keep her , " said the expiring woman . " She will be  --  safewithyou , my dear . Take her away  --  so innocent  --  so young  --  Joseph ? Promise me ? " " Yes , Katherine , " he said . The gaslight rose and fell in a slight draft of air . The pallor of Katherine 's face shone in it like marble , itself . " I promise . She sighed deeply . Her eyes still held his in that pathetic hope and certitude , and she tried to smile . Then she sighed again , and closed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and he did not seep319the doctor return with the priest and did not hear the beginning of the Litany for the Dying . He did not see Tom Hennessey standing in the doorway , shrinking , not daring to enter . He saw only Katherine 's face , becoming smaller and smaller , but quiet now and with growing peace . He did not see the great golden Crucifix that stood over the bed . Nothingexisted , had being , but Katherine Hennessey . Only he heard her final faint breath . He still knelt , not moving . Her hand was flaccid in his . Then he dropped his head so it lay beside Katherine 's and he closed his eyes and the awful ripping of grief tore him apart , and he felt that he , too , had died . His cheek touched hers and slowly he turned his head and touched her fallen flesh with his lips . " Go forth , Christian soul , " the priest intoned , and Joseph was again on the ship beside his mother , and there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , when he went slowly down the stairs to the hall , feeling his way with his feet like an old man , he found Tom Hennessey sitting beside his daughter and holding her in his arms and comforting her , and Bernadette had clenched her young arms about her father 's neck and she was sobbing against his chest . " It is n't true , my darling , " said the senator . " It was all lies . The woman tried to make me leave your mother  --  she was mad and infatuated  --  Itried to drive her away  --  I wrote her a foolish letter because I pitied her  --  I confess I was a little drunk  --  My darling , your blessed mother had always been delicate , her heart , but she understood  --  She understood . You must n't grieve . It is for the best  --  an end to her suffering  --  " His voice had never been so deep and so resonant and so rich , and Bernadette 's sobs lessened . Then the senator saw Joseph near him , silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither spoke . For a long time their eyes held each other . At last Joseph , hardly making a sound , left the hall , opened the door and went out into the warm summer night and closed the door after him . But the senator stared at the door for a considerable space , for never had a man ever looked at him like that before . Mr. James Spaulding was old but his avidly sympathetic eyes under their heavy lids were as bright and malignant and smiling as ever , and his hair as flagrantly dyed . The rubbery texture of his features  --  nowp320wrinkled and somewhat collapsed  --  had become even more mobile and seemed almost in constant motion , with the pursing and pushing out of lips , with the wrinkling of forehead and heavy cheeks and the sniffing and twitching of nose . His ears were larger and pushed out his hair which was now poetically near his shoulders . He affected the long soberly rich coat of Prince Albert , and the striped trousers and the subdued cravat and the big pearl pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very rich , for he not only received a handsome " stipend " from the estate of Mr. Healey , as had been designated in the will , but Joseph was careful to give him gifts also , for , as Mr. Healey had jovially warned him , " You 've got to keep on buying your friends , Joe , no matter how loyal and true they seem to be . You can buy them with services , but there 's no substitute for cash . There 's one thing sure : You ca n't buy them with protestations of love and appreciation and sweet words . No nourishment in them . " So Joseph continued to buy Mr. Spaulding and had had no reason to complain of the return in faithfulnessand attention to his interests . They did not trust nor like each other , for Mr. Spaulding had also detected the peculiar probity that lay below the immense large rascalities of Joseph 's manipulations , and Mr. Spaulding never trusted anyone who was not as great a scoundrel as he was , himself . Joseph had doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to tripling it . " Midas touch , " said Mr. Spaulding with admiration . " Luck of the Irish , as Ed used to say . But you 've got to have no conscience , " he would add with virtue . He now feared Joseph , he who had never feared a man before and this increased both his respect and his dislike . He could not understand why Joseph had not joined the company of voracious and malevolent men who had looted the prostrate South . He also could not understand the hatred Joseph felt for Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania , ruler of the Republican House of Representatives , and once a vicious enemy of the conciliatory and grief-stricken Abraham Lincoln who had only desired the healing of fratricidal wounds . It was Stevens who had proclaimed , concerning the beleaguered South : " I have never desired bloody punishment to any great extent , but there are punishments quite as appalling and longer remembered than death ! They are more advisable , because they will reach a greater number . Strip a proud people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain Republicans , send them forth to slave labor and teach their children to enter the workshops  --  and you will thus humble thep321proud traitors . " He advocated that Congress carve up " the damned rebel provinces , " and fill them with settlers from the North  --  " as though , " Joseph said , thinking of Ireland , " the whole South were a conquered foreign land . " Stevens tried to force Congress to divide up into tiny thirty-five acre farms , the great plantations of the South , and sell them to freedmen at ten dollars an acre . " I should like to see the Southern whites , " said Stevens , " be forced to return to their origins in the British Isles ! Or perhaps to France . " Joseph said to Mr. Spaulding , " He is a low-born dog , and he is full of secret hatred of himself , which is to be expected . " But Joseph was also thinking of the Irish estates which had been seized by the English and sold to Scots and Englishmen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onto the highways and byways with their wives and children and old parents . Mr. Spaulding confessed , himself , that he could not understand the virulence of Stevens , who was one of the foremost in the persecution and attempted impeachment of President Andrew Johnson , who had mildly attempted to carry out the merciful plans of the murdered Lincoln . " I can , " said Joseph , who had read Das Kapital , by Karl Marx , and who remembered his conversations with Mr. Montrose . " He hates himself , for he knows what he is , and to escape the effects of this hatred he hates others , particularly those of finer parentageand tradition . " He found little to choose between the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx of x848 and Thaddeus Stevens 's convictions . " Though Marx , " he would reflect , " came of better blood and breeding . " Thaddeus Stevens , in his blood lust , longed for vengeful power over the helpless . Mr. Spaulding remembered that Joseph had come to him and had said , " Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden background , his earlier life , any congress with women , his ambitions , his private affairs . " For Stevens , to Joseph , had become the epitome of the English conqueror , without mercy or justice or compassion . Mr. Spaulding had sedulously carried out his mission . No one knew exactly what had happened  --  not even Joseph himself knew completely  --  but Stevens , on the very crest of his triumphant hatred , died suddenly on a sweltering August day in 1868 in Washington , and to the last he was voracious and brutal of lip , and Napoleonic in posture . Yet the evil that had lived in him lived after him , and the Radical Acts set up by Radical Republicans in the North almost destroyed the fallen South , and almost mortally divided a precariously united nation . It was not the last time that Joseph had put his power for or against a politician . The time had now come , he had decided , to destroy the man he most despised in the world , a man who , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported him with a view to loot in the South and had voted with him to impeach President Johnson . Joseph , to increase his power , had become an American citizen . He had arranged a meeting with Mr. Spaulding this warm August day , and he would soon arrive at Mr. Spaulding 's offices with his secretary , Timothy Dineen . Mr. Spaulding had often complained to himself that Joseph was " secretive , " and did not often ask the advice of wiser and older heads  --  like Mr. Spaulding 's  --  and bought and manipulated without apparently consulting anyone . So Mr. Spaulding did not know that Joseph had bought vast acreages in Virginia , at a very low price , and had sold them to Mr. Montrose  --  Clair Devereaux  --  for an even lower price . There was just a simple notation in Joseph 's personal books : Investment in Virginia  --  large loss . Mr. Spaulding wondered at this , for Joseph was probably the only man who had sustained losses in the South . It was dangerous now , in the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , and when Mr. Spaulding had incredulously protested Josephhad said , " I despise Whigs . " To Joseph the whole tragedy of the country had become a conflict between England and Ireland . Had this been pointed out to him by an astute philosopher he would have jeered with derisive laughter , for , as he frequently said , he had no allegiances , no country he loved , and all nations were for exploitation . Only Mr. Healey would have known and understood . Mr. Spaulding knew all the villainies of men , but little of the deep and passionate and subterranean origin of their motives . So , as Mr. Spaulding awaited the arrival of his client , he read last night 's editions of the Philadelphia Messenger , the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania . The Philadelphia Messenger pointed out , with pride , that it was Mr. Joseph Armagh who had investigated young Jay Gould  --  " the audacious Wall Street financier "  --  and had brought to the attention of President Grant that Mr. Gould had " cornered the fifteen milliondollars in gold in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . " Mr. Armagh had also informed the President that it was the President 's own brother-in-law who had been the Spy in the White House , and in Washington , and had so conspired with Mr. Gould . As a result of this manipulation the whole country 's currency had been shaken , and the whole financial structure . " But Mr. Armagh 's enlightenmentof the President caused the Treasury to move in and sell government gold , thus saving the country , which might have been ruined . " Unfortunately , the paper continued , Mr. Gould 's government contacts informed him in time , and he sold at once  --  at an enormousp323profit . Other plotters , less in touch with Washington , fell into bankruptcy . " Are the bankers our rulers , or are our elected officials ? " demanded the newspaper in wrath . Joseph , on reading this , had laughed out loud and with contempt at such naivete . His banker friends , whom he frequently met in New York , and who came from other countries to meet with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For , " as they said , " America is not prosperous enough for looting as yet . That will come later  --  we do not know how much later  --  with the establishmentof a private banking institute in America , which will have the power to coin money , and not Congress : a Federal Reserve System . This can come only in the form of an amendment to your Constitution . " It was only in New York City , these past few years , and in some other Northern cities of the New England States  --  notably Massachusetts  --  where it was completely safe to be a Democrat . And the Democrats , being only human , found looting quite easy for men of no conscience and inspired only by greed and the lust for power . In theft and rapacity they made even the Radical Republicans look like country shopkeepers . In two years alone the organization of William M. Tweed and a few others of his Tammany conspirators stole seventy-five million dollars from the depressed city of New York , and their total thievery from 1865 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of two hundred millions . Tweed threatened contractors doing business with New York so efficiently that they added one hundred percent to their bills to the city , and returned the overcharge to the Tweed Ring . As a result , in one case alone , New York paid nearly two million dollars for plastering one lone city building , and over a million and a half for some thirty-five tables and chairs . Tweed , of course , was a director of the Erie Railroad , together with one Fisk and Jay Gould , and suborned politicians and judges and even many in the legislature . This was done with such aplomb , such grace and geniality , such lovinglaughter , that the miserable inhabitants of New York felt only love for their exploiters , and even adoration , for did these not , close to Election Day , supply them with bread and food and money and beer and whiskey and coal and other gifts for their votes ? The fact that if the Tweed Ring had not robbed them in the first place they could have bought these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simpleminds , or , if some man pointed this fact out to them they became infuriated . Once Joseph had read , " If the people are robbed , oppressed and exploited , if they are driven to wars and calamities and panics andp324destitution , they , themselves , are the guilty , for they are stupid beyond imagining and look no further than their voracious bellies . " An informed electorate , who would elect only just men no matter their financial power or lack of it , was an impossible dream . Mankind adores its betrayers , and murders its saviors . Joseph did not intend to be a savior of America , and he often found himself thinking , " The lumpen proletariat , which has no reason for existing at all ! " It was with a sort of brutal vengeance , then , that he had , as director of two railroads , approved the most appalling retaliations on the Molly Maguires , the desperate and striking Irish railroad workers in Pennsylvania . If the Molly Maguires did not murder and fight as violently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succumbed merely for food , then they deserved what they received . I found a way , thought Joseph . Let them find a way , too . For this reason he had not entirely detested the Tweed Ring . They were Irish who had refused to remain despised and destitute , and had looted as they had been looted . He had informed on Jay Gould and his fellow conspirators not because he , himself , found them reprehensible but because they had threatened his own profits . But the Philadelphia Messenger and the Pittsburgh newspapers fawned on Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh , and imputed to him the most immaculate motives and patriotism  --  " though he had been born in Ireland "  --  and wondered aloud why he had not sought public office for himself , " for the sake of his adopted country . " ( The newspapers quoted a member of the President 's Cabinet who had said , with rage , " You ca n't use tact with a congressman ! They are all thieves and open to bribery , as we all know . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The people , of course , had not listened . ) Joseph had smiled darkly when he had read these effusions the night before he came for consultation with Mr. Spaulding . He , himself , had been among the bribers of eager congressmen for the sake of his railroads . ( A railroad construction company , Credit Mobilier , had stolen twenty-four million dollars from the U. S. Treasury , and this had been accomplished with the aid of a congressman . The congressman had suborned his own colleagues in Congress by giving them free stock in several railroads , which paid over six hundred percent in dividends a year . ) Public office was not for Joseph Armagh . It was more profitable to manipulate the government from outside rather than from within . He was to teach his son , Rory , this most salient fact . " The American people beg to be seduced , " he told Rory . " Why should we refuse their love ? This is as true in your day as it was in mine . " When Rory mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tweed Ring 's secret accounts to the New York Times , which published them in 1871 , it was the end of the Ring . The Ring , Rory reminded his father , had tried to bribe the intrepid newspaper with five million dollars not to publish the accounts , but had failed . The newspaper had aroused the desperate New Yorkers and Tweed was put in prison . ( Tweed later escaped to Spain , in the guise of a sailor , but even there the newspaper followed him and this resulted in his identification and arrest . He died in a New York prison in 1878 . ) Joseph then said to his son , Rory : ' We must , of course , always remember the Fourth Estate , as Edmund Burke called the press . I admit that if they , together , ever exposed the government and its thieves  --  and us  --  that would be the end . But we have ways of suborning and buying the press , too . Not all of them , certainly , but a number . For we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed and said , " Rory , you have probably observed that the newspapers often speak of a changingworld . ' But the world never changes . It is always the same  --  the eater and the eaten . As your Church told you when you were a child , it is Original Sin , and thank God for it . It has made us rich and powerful . " He thought of the Panic of 1873  --  76 , which had , by forcing out small railroaders , made vast fortunes for the Vanderbilts  --  and himself . On this hot and golden , dry and rustling August day , Mr. Spaulding read the laudatory effusions of the newspapers concerning Joseph Armagh , and smiled downwards and rubbed his oily and elastic nose , and waited for his client . He wondered how much Joseph would give him this time , and for what . Joseph arrived with Timothy Dineen before noon , for he had been out in the oil fields since early morning accompanied by his manager , Harry Zeff . ( The Armagh Enterprises now had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's headquarters , and his assistants were the younger men who had been Mr. Healey 's " associates , " plus clerks and lawyers to the number of over two hundred . ) Mr. Spaulding was all love and heartiness on greeting the young man , and full of solicitude and little tender cries and congratulations . He patted and plucked , though he knew very well that Joseph detested intimacies or even the touch of others . " Sit down , dear boy , do ! " exclaimed Mr. Spaulding . He ignored Timothywho abhorred him . Joseph sat down in a deep red leather chair and Timothy stood near him as though guarding him , his black eyes studying Mr. Spaulding as if he expected him to produce a knife orp326another lethal instrument . " Brandy , Joe ? Whiskey ? Wine ? I have them all ! " " Nothing , " said Joseph . He looked worn yet more potent than ever , and his leanness had increased rather than diminished with his prosperity . He had learned not to despise fine clothing , and his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not magnificent , and his vest was not embroidered and his linen was plain white . His black cravat was thin and tied in a bow rather than folded , and a black pearl held its knot . His boots were elegant , though now dusty from the fields . His russet hair was still thick and vital but it had faded , here and there , to shadows of incipient gray . He was cleanshavenas always , and was not following the fashion for mustaches and beards and heavy sideburns . His face was still bony and taut , almostfleshless , his arched nose thinner than ever , his mouth still a closed blade . But his small blue eyes had gained in fixed power over the years and sometimes glittered between his auburn lashes when he was angry or annoyed . There were only a few men who admired the appearance of Joseph Armagh , but women found him fascinating and his cold indifference to the majority only increased their infatuation . Mr. Spaulding cleared his throat and glanced at Timothy . " Mr. Dineen ? " " Whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad now with good living , but his muscles were firm and active and his black hair was abundant and carefully waved . " Whiskey it is ! " cried Mr. Spaulding in delight , as if Timothy had given him extraordinary pleasure . " What a warm day it is , to be sure . Yes , indeedy . We expect cooler days at this time in August . " He smiled expansively and lovingly as he poured whiskey and soda into a tall glass for Timothy , and extended it to him , making a leg , thought Timothy who took the glass without an expression of thanks . Mr. Spaulding sat down and beamed at Joseph . " I have been reading all about you in the papers , dear boy ! Amazing entrepreneur ! Associate of the great New York Wall Street Financier , Mr. Jay Regan  --  the Goulds  --  the Fisks ! Proud that he is a citizen of this mighty Commonwealth ! Railroads , mining , oil , milling , building , financial baron ! " " Not to mention my brothels , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my Northern distilleries . " Mr. Spaulding held up tender palms . " They are services deeply appreciatedif not publicly approved , " he chuckled . " Do you not serve humanityintimately as well as industrially and financially ? This is not to be deplored , no matter the blue noses . "  | " Nor my gun-running here and there , in Mexico and abroad , " said Joseph , as if Mr. Spaulding had not spoken . The older man chuckled again , but now his eyes were wary . Joseph was baiting him . He said , " We must make a living at anything that comes to our hands . " " Such as looting the South of its cotton , " said Joseph . " Well , I was not guilty of that . " Mr. Spaulding sighed . " I did n't make an enormous profit , Joseph , though others did . It was enough , but not enormous . Besides , had I anything to do with Reconstruction ? No . " Joseph said , " Harry Zeff tells me your recent reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time . I am taking the two o'clock to Winfield . I have a mission for you . " He paused . He did not move even a finger , yet he gave the appearance of ruthless quickening . " I want you to send me , post haste , a full report on Governor Tom Hennessey . Everything you have , know of accurately , and from your files , which Mr. Healey began and enlarged . No matter how small  --  I want it . I should like a brief sketch of his father , too . " A hot and brilliant silence fell in the large offices , which smelled of warm leather and wax and lemon oil . Mr. Spaulding had folded his hands on his desk . He regarded Joseph intently . His smile had disappearedbut his eyes were brighter and the heavy lids lower . Then Mr. Spaulding said  --  Joseph 's eyes had suddenly frightened him  --  " Your father-in-law . " His voice , usually so fruity and full of tremolos , was fiat and expressionless . " My father-in-law . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grandfather of my two children . " Timothy shifted on his neat feet and drank deeply of his whiskey . There was a sudden shrill singing of cicadas soaring through the open windows . The hills beyond , though still green , showed a tarnishing here and there where hot yellow dust had settled on them , and all at once the traffic on the street was very imminent in the room . " The governor is running again for office this autumn , " said Mr. Spaulding , who was becoming unnerved . " Has what you desire anything to do with that ? " " Yes , " said Joseph . His quiet hands , clasped on his knee  --  long and thin and well-shaped  --  did not stir . " But , " suggested Mr. Spaulding , and now he licked a corner of his lips with a wet and darting tongue , " more than that ? " " More than that . " Then the laconic Joseph said , " I want him absolutelyruined . Stripped . Dishonored . Prison , if possible , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has had too much help to cover up . " Mr. Spaulding leaned back in his chair . He was never shocked at anything , and even this did not startle him . But he was curious . " It might rebound on you , Joe , " he said . " Your father-in-law . " " How can it ? " said Joseph . " I control quite a number of newspapers , especially those in Pennsylvania . I have influence in New York , too . But even if some muckraking sheet blares it out , how can it hurt me ? " He gave a faint smile . " I am not running for public office . I am not a politician who can be hurt by public opinion , or votes . There is nothing anyone can do to me , either the people or the government . I am entirely too rich . My affairs are  --  respectable . I am a director of the big Handell Oil Company , and director of many other companies . I am invulnerable . A word or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think we could even keep it out of the newspapers entirely . We will give him a chance to submit or be publicly crucified . He has only to renounce any desire to be governor again  --  and accede to the loss of his fortune , to the extentwe can manage . I will be the one to give him that advice . " " He will never know who did it , " said Mr. Spaulding . " I intend to inform him , when it is done , " said Joseph . Mr. Spaulding caught his breath . He had guessed long ago that Joseph hated his father-in-law , but he had thought it a conflict of temperament . Governor Hennessey had been overwhelmingly pleased by his daughter 's choice of a husband . Her wedding had drawn dignitaries from all over the Commonwealth , and Washington , and two foreign ambassadors had been present . The wedding had taken place in Philadelphia in the governor 's house  --  his own , not the Commonwealth 's  --  andit was still mentioned frequently among society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so ostentatious , that one or two small newspapers had protested " this extravagance in the midst of a Panic  --  people starving  --  strikers being murdered by the railroaders  --  miners being shot down in their own little shacks before their wives and children . The display must invite the anger of Providence . " Mr. Jay Regan , Mr. Fisk , and Mr. Gould had been there , with their resplendent wives and the ladies ' jewels . The little daring newspapers had mentioned Mr. Gould in particular , and his cornering of the gold currency , but it had not known of Joseph 's part in the defeat of the larger conspiracy to ruin the country . " You will inform him , " said Mr. Spaulding in a thoughtful tone , rememberingeverything . " Of course , Joseph , it is not my affair , but wep329have been friends since you were a youth and I first taught you law at our dear Ed Healey 's behest . May I ask why ? " " No , " said Joseph , and saw Katherine Hennessey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk . His eyelidsblinked rapidly . He said , in a subdued voice , " Mrs. Armagh  --  even if she never guesses the  --  the  --  diablo ex machina , as it were  --  will be very hurt , for she was always devoted to her father , and he to her . " Joseph smiled with grimness . " Mr. Spaulding , " he said , " you feel no commiseration for Mrs. Armagh , though you have known her from childhood . You are merely curious . I do n't intend to satisfy your curiosity . As for Mrs. Armagh being distressed , I doubt it . She has never been pleased that her father saw fit to marry a girl not much older than herself , a few months after we were married . A girl , I might recall to you , who already had an ambiguous child less than a year old . " " There was no scandal , Joseph . " " Of course not . I saw to that , and so did Hennessey . He adopted the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought of the day Katherine Hennessey had died , and the young woman who had come to her with her pleas . The young lady , it was later discovered  --  but not publicly  --  had been the daughter of a congressman , and a powerful one also . On her marriage to Tom Hennessey the newspapers had declared that she was " a young widow , relict of one of our heroic officers who later died as a result of his wounds and left her with an afflicted little boy . " ( The affliction was the fact that he " had never seen his young father . " ) Joseph felt no hatred for Elizabeth Hennessey , the new young wife . She , too , had been a victim of the senator 's lies , cruelties , seductions , and betrayal . Her father must have had considerable power in the White House , Joseph had thought when the marriage had taken place . He later discovered that the congressman had been a relative of the President , and one much favored by him . Bernadette had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " a dishonor to my mother , " for she had recognized the newspaper photograph of the young lady immediately when the engagement was announced . She remembered that her father had stigmatized the girl as a trollop , a strumpet of the streets , an adventuress , but Elizabeth was none of these things . She was the daughter of a notable congressman , and Bernadette , always conscious of class , had found that unpardonable . This , and the fact that her adored father had displaced her in his affections , was the real reason for her outrage . The " dishonor " to her mother meant nothing at all , for Mama had been a fool , though a sweet and tender one , but Bernadette , to her utmost surprise , discov/ered that she had loved her mother a little and she was desolate for months . ( There was also the reality of the little boy , named Courtney , the name of Tom 's father . Bernadette had hoped to have that name for her own son . ) Her father , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before her mother had died of her grief and shock , and had loved someone else more than he had loved his daughter , and he had lied to her , vilifying the girl he later married . " One of these days ! " Bernadette had sobbed to her husband , " I will tell Lizzie exactly what my father said about her , to me ! " " She probably knows what your father is , my love , " Joseph had replied . This remark had precipitated Bernadette 's quick and flaming anger in defense of her father , who had had the ill luck to marry two stupid women . However , her defense did not decrease her wrath against Tom Hennessey . Joseph had not cared enough to wonder at this or talk to his wife concerning her inconsistencies . He did not care enough for Bernadette to console or soothe her , either . The emotions of women were of no interest to him , and if they displayed them in his presence he was bored and vexed , as one is annoyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet . He found no intellectual satisfaction in conversing with women  --  he was almost convinced they had no intellects  --  except for Regina , his sister . A silence had again fallen in Mr. Spaulding 's office . He was still avid with curiosity . He felt no commiseration for Governor Hennessey and what this would all mean to him . Joseph Armagh was stronger than the governor . Joseph Armagh would destroy the governor , for his own reasons , which were not known to Mr. Spaulding . The weaker , as usual , would go down . That was the law of nature and why should man quarrel with it ? It was not even a matter of morality , or , coming down to it , legality . " It may take time , Joseph , " said Mr. Spaulding . " Time is money , " said Joseph . " The more time the less money . Paradox , is n't it ? " Mr. Spaulding understood . " Say , about six weeks before the elec-tions ? " " No . He must withdraw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . " He made a motion as if to rise , and Mr. Spaulding said with haste , " I will attend to it as soon as possible . The information goes , as usual , to your house in Green Hills , and not your office ? " " Yes , " said Joseph , and stood up and Timothy put down his empty glass . Mr. Spaulding rose and the two men looked at each other over thep331desk . " Jim , " said Joseph , " you have been loyal and most helpful to me through these years since Mr. Healey died . In appreciation  --  your birthday is next week , is n't it ?  --  you will receive a small token from me . This will not be part of the payment upon receipt of the evidence I have requested . " His voice was a rich parody of Mr. Spaulding 's but the latter did not notice . " Joseph , " said Mr. Spaulding , with real emotion , " you are too kind . " The astute and intellectual Timothy Dineen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that he had Joseph Armagh 's full and unrestrained confidence . In the matter of business , it was true , Joseph trusted him and never questioned him . But he never spoke of his own feelings or his own reasons for doing anything , nor approached Timothy beyond the ordinary hedges of friendship and mutual respect . Timothy often guessed a number of things , intuitive as all the Irish , but he was never really positive . Joseph came as close as possible to regarding any other human being as a confidant when with Harry Zeff , but even here there was some reservation of self , some refusalof commitment , some detachment , some restraint . Never was there true bonhomie , total relaxation , positive warmth , towards even Harry , yet Timothy understood that both men would have risked their lives for each other and that Harry would not only have risked his life but would have given it without a thought , and that he loved Joseph more than he did even his Liza and his children . " The trouble with poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he believes no one honestly and completely cares about him , except his sister Regina , and I think he has his doubts there , too . He was so broken about Mr. Healey 's death because it came to him that Mr. Healey had greatly cared for him . I think he felt a little appalled at that , " and Harry had smiled wryly . " It disarranged his conclusions about people for a time , and Joe does n't like his neat conclusions getting untidy , or disordered . It takes too much time to resettle them . I think he finally decided , in the interests of neatness and reason , that Mr. Healey had some affection for him , and he had no other heirs , and so  --  " Harry had spread out his dusky hands expressively . " I often wonder why he married Mrs. Armagh , " Timothy had said . " He certainly has no sound attachment to her . That 's obvious to any-body . " " I 've wondered , too , " said Harry . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying kind . I do n't think he ever cared about a woman in his life , except as a frequent necessity . Yes , there is his sister , of course , butp332she 's hardly a woman to him . " Harry had given Timothy a quick and covert glance , but Timothy had only nodded . " Sometimes I 'm sorry for Mrs. Armagh , " said Timothy , " though she 's a lady hard to be sorry for , with that temper and that cynicism of hers , and her skeptical outlook and her  --  well , her real malice for people . Yet , she loves him to distraction . In comparison , her children are nothing to her . " " Well , " said Harry , " he 's rich and strong , and women love that , and he 's handsome in a hard sort of way . Must appeal to women . I 'm sorry for Mrs. Joe , too . " Timothy , this hot August afternoon , after leaving Mr. Spaulding , was riding back to Winfield in Joseph 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healey . He sat at a table going over his papers . Joseph sat in a chair near the large windows and looked out through them , but Timothy knew he was not seeing anything of the hot landscape , all gold and green and russet and purple and blue , which was moving rapidly beyond them . What did men like Joseph Armagh think , when they were alone , or when they forgot their companions ? Timothy was not so stupid as to believe that Joseph thought exclusively of money and power , as other people averred with malignance and envy . Mr. Armagh was a man , and in spite of himself he had a man 's emotionsand a man 's blood and a man 's thoughts . He was not a machine , not an abstraction . The life force of humanity could burst through rock . Even when held down it seethed underneath in the darkness , waiting the day of explosion . Did Joseph think of his brother , Sean ? Timothy remembered the day when Joseph had received a letter from Sean , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedless and finally rebellious young man . Sean had left Harvard without even a farewell to his teachers or fellow students . Sean had not cared in the least for them , or for dull disciplined learning , or the law Joseph had insisted he study . Sean wanted to sing , to laugh with joyous companions , to drink until he fell unconscious  --  but still singing  --  to play happy music , and beautifulmusic , and , as he had told Joseph , to live . Timothy had once heard them raging at each other . " You are a gray stone ! " Sean had shouted . " You are n't a man , a human being at all ! What do you know of life and loving , of pain  --  lovely deep pain down in your heart  --  of turmoil in your soul , if you have one ? What do you know of deprivation and grief and hunger and anguish ? You know nothing , nothing , but your damned money , and making more of it , no matter how , and the hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild passion and his sense of personal injury , had not noticed the sudden terribleness of Joseph 's face , and the clenching of his lips . He had cried on : " What do you know of loneliness , and loss of hope ? You rarely if ever came to see me in the orphanage ! Yes , I was told you were ' working , ' for God 's sake , and had no money to visit me ! That 's a lie ! You could have spared some of your money to come , and tell me that you thought about me and cared about me . But , you did n't . There I was , stuck in the mud of that damned orphanage , among sniveling nuns and dirty brats , with no beauty and no pleasure and no anticipations  --  and there you were off , forgetting me , and Regina , and not giving us a thought  --  just making your damned money ! And what has it done for you , pray ? Nothing . You ca n't even enjoy it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible , and Sean became even more frantic about his " wrongs . " " You must have hated us ! Yes , you 've provided for us , and it must have killed you , almost . You deserted us when we needed you most , as little children . And for what ? Just for money . Once , when I was nine I had the pneumonia . You never came . It was nothing to you . You probablyhoped I 'd die . " Joseph had stood up then , and Timothy had seen a long and awful trembling along his body . Joseph had lifted his hand and had struck Sean wordlessly but savagely across the face , and then had left the room . Sean had whimpered . Then , holding his flaming cheek , he had collapsedinto a chair and had wailed aloud in self-pity , and then noticingthe quiet Timothy had pleaded with him for compassion . Timothy listened , and then he had said almost gently , " You are a dog , a selfish swine , and you do n't deserve one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is about all you are worth , and at your age , too , for Christ 's sake ! " That was the last time Timothy saw Sean Armagh . Sean returned to Harvard the next day , after the Christmas holidays . It was the final year at Harvard , and Sean had left the university in the spring , and had disappeared . Only Timothy , sent there to investigate , noticed that Sean had been careful to take with him everything of value in his handsomeroom , which Joseph had bought for him , and his best clothing and his fine luggage . It took several months to find Sean , and Timothy led the search . He was finally discovered , gloriously disheveled , golden-haired , drunk and soiled , laughing and drinking and joking and singing in the saloons of Boston . Sometimes he was accompanied by a fiddler . Sometimes therep334was an ancient piano which he could make thunder and ring and clamor and dance at will . He played and he sang for a handful of pennies , for beer and whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spurious friendship of the saloons , the spurious warmth and companionship and admiration . In a few months he was penniless and ragged . " We ca n't let him starve , " said Joseph , with that terrible look on his face when his brother was mentioned . " We ca n't give him any money in any amount , either . He would just throw it away on his fellow ruffians , and drunkards and ne'er-do-wells . " " Let him starve , " Timothy had said with unusual feeling and Joseph had glanced up at him sharply , had studied him , and then had slightly smiled . " No , " he said . " We ca n't let him starve . I do n't know why , but we ca n't . Perhaps it is because his sister would n't like it . Does he have a rooming house ? Well , see that he gets ten dollars a week . Tell one of my boys in Boston to give it to him , Tim . " But two years ago Sean had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , or professed not to know . He might have been murdered , been injured or died and buried in potter 's field . The hospitals were canvassed , the poor houses , the refuges for such as Sean . He was not there . At each disappointment , at each ending of hope , Regina said nothing though her face became more and more translucent and lovely and ethereal , and she was more attentive to Joseph . " He is like my father , " said Joseph . Regina bent and pressed her cheek to her brother 's , and Joseph had taken her hand like a child and Timothy had marveled again . He had known then , without any doubt , that Regina Armagh had her brother 's complete love and confidence and absolute trust , and that she knew the import of his thoughts if not the thoughts themselves , and that for him she had the tenderest love and an almost saintlike compassion , and knew all about him and sorrowedover him . Joseph never spoke now of his brother . He never searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forgiveness , Joseph would have helped him . But he would never forgive Sean . Sean was as dead to him as if he had seen him in his grave . He would never forget . Regina must have guessed this for she did not speak of Sean to Joseph , but only to Timothy , and sometimes she would put her hands over her face and cry . Was Joseph , today , as the train roared in its passage , thinking of any of this ? Timothy asked himself . He did not know . Joseph 's harsh profilep335was illuminated by the falling sun . He neither smoked nor drank . He rarely attended social events in Green Hills or Philadelphia or New York or Boston , or in other cities , unless they were connected with business . He had a wife he did not love but who occasionally amused or beguiledhim a little , and sometimes even made him laugh when she teased him or cajoled him . Perhaps he had some fondness for her . She was not pretty , but she was charming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp and diverting tongue . She filled the house with her loud Irish voice , her laughter and her gusto , and her admonitions to servants and to children . Rory and Ann Marie , the twins , were nearly five years old . Did Joseph love his children ? He was sedulous about them and often spoke to his wife about her carelessness concerning them . They were denied nothing , and Timothy thought this unfortunate . The young should be deprived frequently , as a matter of discipline . Perhaps Joseph was fond of them , but would give them nothing more than fondness . He was , perhaps , as Harry Zeff had said , afraid to love , suspicious of love , and cynical above all things . And , thought Timothy , who can blame him , remembering Sean ? Love betrayed , if it did not descend into hatred , became wariness and indifference and doubt , fearful of fresh hurt . Exceptfor his sister , Joseph Armagh was joyless . Timothy suspected that there had been little joy in his life at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent man , this man who had nothing , with the exception of his sister , to live for . Perhaps he had once had something for which to live but it was now gone . Yet , he was driven . That was obvious . It is inertia , thought Timothy . But Timothy did not know that it was a vengeance on a world which had denied to Joseph Armagh the ornaments that make life , and had brutalized and had rejected him , and had taken from him the only valuablethings in existence : faith , hope , and love . Governor Hennessey had given half his interest in his house to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Joseph Armagh . ( " It was his wife 's , not his , anyway , " Joseph had remarked . ) When she was twenty-one she inherited half of her mother 's estate . The other half had gone to Tom , who was already married to the congressman 's daughter . So Joseph now lived in the great and beautiful mansion at which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . The gov/ernor rarely visited that house . He and Joseph had nothing to say to each other , though Tom chatted heartily in the presence of his son-inlaw , to cover Joseph 's silences . He told his daughter that he " adored " his grandchildren , though they somewhat subdued his picture of himself  --  intheir presence  --  as an ageless gallant . He was now in his sixties , and as vain and sensual and ambitious as always . His young wife came with him on his visits to Green Hills , but it was most evident that she and Bernadette would never be friends and would only tolerate each other . Elizabeth was , intrinsically , a kind and composed young woman , and very intelligent , and she had long forgiven  --  though not forgotten  --  her husband 's betrayal of her . But more than anything else he loved his little son , Courtney , whom he had " adopted " as the orphaned child of a dead hero . This further inflamed Bernadette 's jealousy , and when the child was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered him to behave himself . She was not so stringent with her own children , and forgave them their selfishness and their tendency to quarrel loudly with each other , and to answer her insolently . " This is a new day for children , " she would tell Joseph . " We give them more liberties now , and more freedom , and understand them better , and do not constrain them so much as our parents did us-you and me , Joseph . " Joseph would think of his laughing and singing father , who had been like a child to him , and he would think of his mother , who had died in such agony and fear for her children , and with such desperate love . He said to his wife , " You are quite right , my love . " Bernadette , who had heard an ambiguous note in her husband 's voice , had looked at him piercingly . " Well , " she said , " you must surely remember how your father punished you severely for the slightest thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always correcting you . " Joseph never told her . It would be beyond her comprehension . To Bernadette , Joseph had been a " poor Irish lad , " who had come to Americawith his mother and his brother and sister , and had made a fortune by his own efforts , and also by the will of Mr. Healey . She was never curious about Joseph 's dead parents . She was never curious about his past life , for Bernadette lived in the present . But she was desperately jealous of Regina , who lived in this house , and hated her and longed for her to marry and go away " and leave me in peace with my darling , " she would think . She had been complacent about Sean . She had never liked him though handsome men usually attracted her . When she looked at the regal Regina she would say in herself , " Shanty Irish ! " andp337it would console her . Once Regina was out of this house that would be the end of the " other Armaghs . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who became infatuated with her at first sight  --  and with her brother 's money . She forced Regina to go with her to Joseph 's new house in Philadelphia , where he often stayed for weeks now , and there she would have balls and dinners and soirees for Regina . She , herself , had once been pursued by young men . Regina was endlessly pursued . But Regina smilingly rejected all ardent overtures , though with kindness . Her dark beauty was a radiance with attracted both men and women , young and old . She had but to put on a gown and it was a glowing robe on her lovely figure . Joseph had given her a magnificent sapphire necklace , bracelets and ring , and pins for her black hair , but they were no more brilliant and shining than her blue eyes between those odd golden lashes . Her arms were long and white and round . She was overly tall for a woman , Bernadette would think , but she had a grace that no other woman seemed to possess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities ! " Bernadette would con , jlain to Joseph . " I am afraid poor Regina is very stupid . She hardly ever speaks , and if she does she is so grave it makes me ill . Does n't she ever intend to marry ? How dreadful , if true , " but Bernadette did not believe that Regina would not marry . Joseph said , " Let the girl alone , for God 's sake , Bernadette . You are a shrew sometimes , I 'm thinking . " " She is no girl ! " Bernadette snapped , her hazel eyes flashing with jealousy . " She is twenty-three years old , the same age I am ! " When Joseph did not answer , Bernadette threw up her  --  arms and round eyes in elaborate despair . " Why do n't you help me to get Regina married ? Have you no affection for your sister ? Do you want to see her dry up in old maidhood , and sit by the chimney corner ? " " Regina prefers her life as it is , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighteen and had told him she loved him but now must go away . He tried to forget that day , and there had been no more said about it , but fear lived in him like a brazen snake , tense and coiled . When Bernadette spoke of Regina marrying it was not an annoyance to him . Even marriage , and the separation which marriage would bring between brother and sister , was preferable to  --  that . Anything under God 's evil sun was preferable to  --  that . He thereforebegan to be somewhat of an ally of Bernadette 's , to her comfort.  |p338He  , too , began to look for a husband for Regina . But Regina did not marry . Bernadette , who was as cynical about religion as she was about everything else with the exception of Joseph , made Novenas earnestly for the marriage of Regina . If Regina would marry , she would pray , she would learn to love her . Surely the Blessed Mother did not like it that she hated Regina , though it was not , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints and God and His Blessed Mother , to get Regina out of her house . " ' What have you got against marriage ? " she once asked Regina . " Why , nothing at all , dear Bernadette , " said Regina , surprised , her sweet clear voice amused . " I think it is a holy estate , as the Church teaches . " " Why do n't you enter it then ? " demanded Bernadette . " Everybody thinks it so odd that you are still unmarried , at your age . Why ca n't you fall in love ? " But I am in love , thought Regina , and tears filled her eyes . My heart is dying with love . My spirit is filled with love . I think of nothing  --  but my love . She said , and her voice was low and searching , " You do love Joseph , do n't you , Bernadette ? Truly and eternally love him ? " " Can you ask that ? Dare you ask that ! " cried Bernadette , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love him more than anything in the world . Everything else in the world is nothing to me , compared with Joseph . " " I know , " said Regina , and knew that the time had finally come and she could go in peace . " Always remember that , dear Bernadette . Hold fast to my brother . He needs love more than anything in this world , and he has had so little . Help him . Comfort him . " This was very strange to the vociferous Bernadette , and she actually became unusually still and stared at Regina . " What are you talking about ? Comfort , help him . ' Do I do anything else , by the Saints ? He is my life . There 's nothing else . Why should he need comfort or help ? I 'm here , am I not ? " " Yes , dear , " said Regina , and bent her head and kissed Bernadette on that round , low , and freckled forehead , and Bernadette was freshly startled . She put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , wondering . Her figure was quite matronly now , but still pleasing , and she wore elaborately draped skirts to give her height , and was always scintillating with bracelets and earrings and jeweled combs , and she was always moving with verve . She thought Regina a poorp339thing in her simple frocks and her simple way of dressing all that splendid , glossy black hair . Regina had no more life than a wax doll . She had a thin aquiline nose , too , and not a charming tilted one like Bernadette 's , Why , thought Bernadette in exasperation , does everyone think she is so beautiful ? She does have a presence , and a wonderful complexion , but no spirit . Two days after Joseph had returned to Green Hills from Titusville , Regina went to her brother 's rooms in the great and echoing mansion , the rooms which had once been Governor Hennessey 's . He had had the ornate and baroque furniture removed , and the embroidered draperies and the lace , and had replaced them with fine utilitarian tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the windows , and no gimcracks or ornaments except for several valuablepaintings which hung on dimly painted walls . Bernadette rarely went into those rooms , for they depressed her . All those books , that big mahogany desk , that stark narrow bed  --  it was like the den of a poor man . She , herself , occupied her mother 's rooms , and had embellished them to her own filigreed taste , which leaned towards gilt and velvet and silk and strong color . Her mother 's canopied bed was a fountain of Venetian lace , all falls and swoops and rufflings , over bright pink , and the subdued rugs had been removed for Chinese rugs in the most vehement shades . Every corner was crowded with whatnots heaped with figurines and other trifles , and every spindly table overflowed with them . I have always been a stranger in this house , thought Regina , as she climbed the stairs to her brother 's rooms . I have never had a home exceptin the orphanage . She was whitely resolute tonight , but her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed under her breath , and it seemed to her that her lungs were locked and she could not breathe . A cool sweat had broken out over her face and her body , and she could feel the dampness in her armpits and over her neck and back and in her palms . Her heart was beating with tremendous force , and she gasped as she climbed those wide marble stairs and the lighted chandelier burned her eyes . She prayed , " Oh , dear Lord , help me , help me . " But there was no response and she felt a dragging coldness in her middle and a weakening of her legs under her brown linen frock with its high neck and long sleeves . Her wonderful hair fell down her back in waves and billows and flowed with her movements . " Help me to make Joe understand , dear Blessed Mother , " Regina prayed . " Help him to know that I must go to my Love , to the only marriage I desire and have ever desired , since I was a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she paused at the top of the stairs , and struggled for breath . She thought of her brother and the pain she was about to inflict upon him , and she cringed at the thought , and put her hands over her face , shaking her head slowly from side to side . She was trembling so strongly that she had to brace her hand , finally , against the wall to keep from falling . Of what was she afraid ? Her brother 's sorrow , and only she knew how violent his sorrow could be though it was silent . She thought of Sean , and cringed again . Sean had left him and now she must leave him , never to see him again exceptas a shadow , a formless image . She would hear his voice , but she would not see the years gray and shrink him . Her most pressing misery was that it was very probable that Joseph 's voice would never again be heard by her , and that she would not even see his shadow . Joseph 's angerwas total , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she prayed aloud . " I must do this thing , and he must know . Help him . " Regina had never known fear before , and it had the taste of cold iron in her mouth . She had never known such grief and it was overwhelming . She had endured the destitution of her earlier life with tranquillity and without complaint , for it had seemed a life of the utmost richness to her and not deprivation and hunger . She had never fully understood Sean 's revolt , nor his rebellions and impatience . Grief and fear were not familiars of hers , and she felt terror at their presence now in her mind and spirit . They were shattering . They assaultedher , and almost turned her away . Then , after a while , she felt new strength and resolution and went to Joseph 's door and knocked at it . Dinner was long over . Rory and his twin , Ann Marie , were in their nursery . The servants had gone to their quarters . Where was Bernadette ? No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her round somewhat flat young face , or brushing that long fall of straight brown hair , or trying on some new gowns . Joseph never spent his evenings in companionship with his wife . Regina hesitated . She had a new thought . Surely Joseph loved his wife or he would never have married her . Joseph was not easily moved nor persuaded . He did everything with cold deliberation . He had wanted to marry Bernadette , and he had married her . There was nothing else . Surely he loves her , thought Regina and heard her brother calling to her to enter . Joseph knew her knock and so he was putting aside his book when she entered and his saturnine face showed a lightening and a pleasure no other person ever evoked . It was almost a lover 's smile , with a farp341blue glinting under his auburn brows . He stood up to greet his sister , tall and concave of body , and severely dressed even in the privacy of his own rooms . No one had ever seen him disheveled , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appearance , with the wiry strength of his countrymen . " Regina , " he said , and took her by the hand and sat her down in a dark leather chair near his . He turned down his reading lamp a little so it would not shine in her eyes . Regina dreaded to begin what she must say , so she said , instead , " What are you reading , Joe ? " " Law , " he said . " I 'm always reading law . " He thought of what Cicero had said : " Politicians are not born . They are excreted . " It was hardly a quotation to mention to a young lady , but he smiled again . " I find it invaluablein politics . How do you know what law it is profitable to break unless you know there is such a law ? " She did not smile , as he had expected . He sat down opposite her . " Joe , " she said , " I wish you were not always trying to give the impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He liked to joke with Regina . However , he saw that she was serious and distressed . " I 'm glad you have a good opinion of me , Regina . " She looked down at the hands she had folded in her lap . " Joe , dear , to the end of my life I will always have a good opinion of you , no matter  --  " He was instantly alert . " No matter  --  what ? " She bent her head a little and so he could only see her white foreheadand the arch of her nose , and he wondered , with sudden alarm , if this immured girl had the slightest idea of what he was . She was more his hostess than was the somewhat rowdy Bernadette , for she had more poise and graciousness and natural good breeding , and so she had met scores of his acquaintances , among them some of the most vicious and expedient of politicians and entrepreneurs . She had met the men who worked for him and who managed his countless enterprises and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulations he undertook to have certain politicians brought to public attention , nominated and then elected , though he had been careful not to let her know the cynicism of those manipulations and why he supported those men with money and publicity in his newspapers . He had thought that she believed that this was the way of politics and that the " best men " were always chosen . She had met all these not only in the house in Green Hills but in Philadelphia and in his town house in New York , and in Boston . Yet he had been convinced that the very innocence ofp342his sister prevented her from knowing the truth , and guessing what rascals bowed over her hand . He suddenly thought of Tom Hennessey , and he stared at Regina sharply and repeated , " No matter  --  what ? " " I meant to say , " the girl answered very quietly , " even if you stopped loving me , as your sister . " He was relieved , yet he had the feeling that she had been evasive . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were tears in her eyes . " For God 's sake , Regina ! " he said . " Why should I ever stop loving you ? " " Promise ? " she said , like a child , and tried to smile . " I promise . " But his uneasiness increased . " Even if I leave you , Joe ? " He did not answer her immediately . His eyes fixed themselves upon her intently and for the first time she saw something in them that frightened her . But he spoke calmly enough . " Why should you leave me ? Are you thinking of marrying , Regina ? " " In a way , " she replied , and he could hardly hear her , for she had averted her head again . " The only marriage I ever wanted . " He stood up as if goaded to his feet , but he said nothing , and only watched her . She put out her hand to him but he would not see it . " Oh , Joe , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I promised you that I would n't speak of it again  --  when I was about eighteen . I have tried , Joe , I have tried with all my strength , to put it  --  aside . But it has grown stronger and more demanding all through these years , and now I ca n't resist it any longer . I must go . To the Carmelite Order , in Maryland . I must go at once . Oh , Joe , do n't look at me like that ! I ca n't bear it . You must know that I 've wanted this all my life , ever since I could remember , even as a very young child in the orphanage . When I first spoke of it to you you said I was too young to know my own mind , and that I must see the world , and , Joe "  --  the tears were heavier in her eyes than before  --  " I ca n't bear this world . I ca n't bear it . Once you said to me , A sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and it 's quite true . I do n't want to be part of it , Joe . I ca n't be part of it any longer . " She stood up in agitation and stood before him and he looked down at her with an expression that terrified her . But she swallowed her risingfear , and clasped her hands tightly before her and her face implored him to understand . " What do you know of living ? " he asked in a voice of such immensep343disgust that she took a step backwards . " A convent girl . You may be twenty-three , but you are like a schoolgirl still . I 've taken you to Europe , and to dozens of cities here , but they made no impression on you . You never saw them , did you ? " " Yes , I saw them , Joe . " " If you had seen them you 'd have wanted them . But the nuns blinded you , made a fool and a dolt out of you , deceived you , seduced you into nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiotic dreams and visions and myths . Destroyed you , my sister . " But she was shaking her beautiful head slowly . " No , that is not true . No one even suggested to me that I had a vocation  --  " But Joseph had burst into harsh and raucous laughter . " A vocation , by God ! A vocation for what ? Prison ? Isolation ? Endless witless prayers ? Sacrifices ? For what ? For whom ? To what end ? What purpose ? " She had the wild thought , even in the midst of her fear , that he was like a man desperately and agonizingly fighting for his life , his very life . He was even gasping in quick pants , and clenching and unclenchinghis hands . She could hardly recognize his face . He went on in the most cruel voice she had ever heard : " It was all wasted on you , all that I  --  You know nothing at all . You never had to struggle for anything , or work for anything . You 've lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I provided for you . It probably has palled on you , so you turn to mysteries and occult imaginings , out of sheer idleness ! What have I denied you ? I gave you and  --  " He stopped a moment and his gasping was louder than ever . " I gave you my life , and all there was in it . I thought I also gave you reality , the enlightenment , the education , which a sensible woman should have . I gave you the world I fought for , and now you come to me with vaporingsand girlish simperings and little coynesses and tell me that it was all for nothing , that you do n't want what I have given you . You want , you say , stone cold floors on which to kneel and pray your stupid vain prayers , and confess sins that you never committed , and hide behind screens so that no one will ever see you . You want to hide . Yes , you want to hide ! " " Joe , " she said , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you hiding , Regina ? The world , you will say . But the world has never abused you as it abused me . It never showed you its real face , as it showed me . You know nothing , you fool , you know nothing ! And in your stupidity you indulge yourself in romantic illusionsof a cloistered life , where all is white lilies and incense , andp344pretty statues and imbecile serenity and pious music  --  and those doltish prayers ! You are bored . Why do n't you many , as all women marry , and have children and live the life other women live with contentment ? " Regina 's chin dropped to her chest and Joseph , in his furious rage , hated her as one hates a betrayer . The crown of her black head shimmeredin the lamplight . She was very still , standing there in her brown linen frock which , all at once , looked like a habit to him , loathsome and ugly beyond anything he had ever seen . He wanted to hit Regina , to strike her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also felt a squeezing of intolerable anguish in himself , a disintegrating grief . It was also familiar , and because it brought memories of two other women he stammered roughly , " I 'd rather see you in your coffin ! I 'd rather see you dead ! " She heard the torment in his voice , the despair , the frantic suffering , and she looked up and her face was full of compassion and love as well as fear . " Joe , you do n't understand . I love  --  I want to serve , if only with prayers . I love  --  Joe . " " Love what ? " he exclaimed , with another ruthless gesture . " What God ? What witlessness is that ? There is no God , you damned fool of a maudlin woman ! There is nothing to serve , nothing to pray to , nothing that hears , nothing that has mercy . I know . My father lies in potter 's field , in an unmarked grave , and my mother 's bones be in the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their charity . I saw hundreds die of the Famine , men , women , children , infants , old grandmothers  --  lying in the ditches of the roadways , biting their hands in their last convulsions of hunger . Did your God hear , or care , or send His angels to feed those innocents ? Those of us who survived were turned away from the ports of this country , either to return to Ireland to starve to death or wander like vagabonds on vagabond ships hoping for harbor , for a crust of bread  --  literally , a crust of bread . " Oh , you irrational fool ! You do n't know anything of this world ! Where do you suppose a lot of my money comes from ? From conspiratorialwars , from planned wars . Have you ever been in a hospital for wounded or dying soldiers , younger than yourself ? Have you tended them and bound up their wounds ? What do you know of this accursed world ? I tell you it is hell , and the slaughter of the innocents goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God cares , no God helps , no God hears . And that , by Christ , is what you want to serve  --  a lie , a superstition , a myth , a monumental hoax and fraud , something that never existedand does not exist ! "  |p345Then  Regina said , in that brownly gleaming room which echoed with shouting , " It is for such a world that I must pray , and serve with my prayers . Why do you execrate God for the wickedness of man ? Man has his choices . If he chooses evil that is free will and not even God will , or can , interfere . I know you have no faith , dear Joe . It would be uselessfor me to try to convince you  --  for who can speak of the knowledge of the heart and the soul ? It is only there . I have pity for this world . You think I know nothing . " Her mouth trembled but her eyes held his resolutely . " But I know too much , Joe . Who am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ? I do n't think even God reproaches you  --  too much . In a way , Joe , your whole life has been a prayer  --  for those who did not deserve such a sacrifice  --  Sean and me . No , no . We did not deserve it . I doubt anyone deserves such selflessness . " Joseph was taken aback , even in his fury and contempt and rage . He forced himself to stop panting . He could not stop the hard roar of his heart , but he spoke with reasonable quiet , " If you think and believe that , how can you bring yourself to want to leave me , desert me , betrayme , for a nothingness , for a lie , for emptiness ? " " I 'm not really leaving you , Joe , nor deserting nor betraying you . You will never be outside my prayers , my love . I will only love you more deeply , and be even more grateful to you . You will always be in my thoughts , for , in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stood before him , tall and slender and lovely , her face very pale , her beautiful eyes shining and now unafraid , and he had a sudden abhorrentvision of all that glory immured behind stone walls , and that voice raised only mutedly in prayer , and that soft flesh lying on stone in an ecstatic prostration before  --  insanity . He felt an almost voluptuous sense of horror and revulsion , and it showed in his expression and again Regina took a step backward with renewed fear . " I will not let you go . I wo n't let you destroy yourself , " he said . " I will not be destroying myself . I will be saving myself , Joe . " But now she could only helplessly shake her head , over and over , as if she had no control of her own movements . He watched her and he wanted to take her in his arms and hold her savagely and he also wanted to kill her . She finally said , " I wanted you to understand how I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief and make you angry . But I thought you 'd understand , a little , about my own happiness , for there is no happiness for me in this world and never will be . I must go where there is peace and prayer and penance . It is all I want ; there is nothing else . If youp346understood , even that little , you would say , Go , my sister . Everyone must find happiness , or at least peace , in his own way . " " Happiness ! " he exclaimed , with new and overpowering disgust . " What fool talks of happiness ? There never was such a thing except for hypocrites and liars and the mad . There never was any peace , and never will there be in this world , and this world is all we know and all we 'll ever know . We must make our own compromises with it , and acceptit . But you want to run from it ! If that is n't weakness and cowardiceI 'd like to know what it is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the great love in her soul , her great and humble acceptance and joy in that acceptance , for it would only infuriate her brother more . She said at last , " I must go , dearest Joe . I have already made the arrangements . I leave tomorrow night . I did not tell you before , because I was afraid  --  afraid of my own vacillation  --  that you would persuade me  --  But nothingcan turn me aside , now . Nothing . Not even you , Joe . " She looked at him but he only stared at her with raw hate , a man betrayed and , he thought , betrayed with malice and smug satisfaction . He thought of Sean who had accused him with a cruelty surpassing his own , and had deserted him . So he said in so quiet a voice that Reginacould hardly hear him , " Go , and go to hell , you slut . Go , the both of you . You were n't worth a year of my life . You were n't worth even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Only I know , Joe , " said Regina , and walked silently from the room . He watched her go . He had thought he had known all the desolation it was possible for a man to endure , but this was the worst of all . Now he would not put out his hand to stop his sister , even if he could have stopped her . She had become as dead to him as his brother , and as hateful . Regina went to her own room and knelt on her prie-dieu before the Crucifix on the wall , and she cried silently and tried to pray but there was only pain in her now and a last remembrance of her brother 's face . Bernadette had been aroused in her room by the loud exclamations and shouts of her husband and had tiptoed into the long warm hall to listen . She had heard most of the conversation between Joseph and Regina , and she had felt a huge leap of exultation . Now she would be rid of that simpleton , Regina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world but his wife , faithful , devoted , endlessly loving . Joseph did not appear the next day at all . When Regina , weeping , confided in Bernadette that she must go , and why , Bernadette madep347large dry eyes of sympathy and uttered the most tender words of encouragementand gave Regina the warmest embraces . " Of course I understand , love ! " she cried . " I never knew anyone who had a vocation before , but I understand ! You ca n't resist it . It would be a sin to resist . Do n't worry about Joe . I will console him , and he 'll come to accept it all , himself . " So Regina was comforted and never knew she had been comforted by a young woman who despised her and was glad to see the last of her , and that her consolations had been false and hypocritical . The girl left in more peace than she had believed possible , clinging for a last moment to Bernadette , who accompanied her to the depot with her small luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Bernadette , as she murmured against Regina 's cheek and uttered the most extravagant promises , with elation in her heart and the deepest relief . When Joseph finally appeared the day after Regina had left Bernadettewas all indignation against Regina , and sympathy , but he looked at her and said , " We will not speak of her again , if you please . " Joseph received an interesting letter from Mr. Spaulding one cool September day , addressed to the house in Green Hills . After its effusionsof friendship and attachment , it said , with the utmost delicacy : Our friends accepted the contribution to the Party with grateful astonishmentfor your unequaled generosity , which , they declared , demonstratesyour concern for the Commonwealth and her weal . They will at once attend to the other matters which I earnestly brought to their attention , and trust you will be gratified at the result . After loving inquiries concerning Joseph 's family , Mr. Spaulding added the following : I should not be surprised if a mutual friend visited you almost immediately . If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the letter . But he sat and considered the import with black and vengeful satisfaction . He needed that satisfactionfor his life had become barely tolerable since Regina 's " desertion , " which was now but one piece with Sean 's cruel accusations and flight . He felt alone as he had never felt alone in all his life before , and had some sentimentalist archly pointed out to him his wealth , his wife and his children , he would have burst out laughing and the sound would not have been pleasant . He had never before thought of usingp348his family as a source of revenge , but in these days he thought of it constantly . Often , in the past , he had contemplated suicide , but only as a random if acute and very brief impulse . Now it intruded several times a day , and with it a passing but enticing sense of relief . He knew at last that a man should find his motivation for living in himself and not for others who could and would betray without any hesitation at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country , some for some incredible God , some for their families . But Joseph had come to realize that all these were externals , and had no identity with a man 's own identity , except , possibly , he would think with wryness , that God who had  --  or the myth of Him  --  seduced his sister from her brother 's house . That , to Joseph , was the utmost madness and the utmost secret betrayal of one 's integrity . No abstract had verity in man 's immediacy of needs and hungers and survival . Call this animalism , if you wish , Joseph would think . But what is there in man 's history  --  except for a few demented saints who never knew the world anyway  --  but animalism ? He had come to hate himself in that he had deprived his own youth of any joy or adventure or investigation into available pleasures , for his family . He wondered , sometimes , if he had not been a little mad , himself , in regardinghis own existence as valuable only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his personal individual self it was worthless . He would often think of Mr. Healey , who had lived only for himself and so had found life interesting , exciting , and rewarding , and had died in bliss . Mr. Healey had not died in sorrow , and not with black vengeancein his soul . Mr. Healey had never dedicated his life and his labor to others , had never considered others more meritorious than himself or more deserving , or that they should be served first before he was served . Consequently he had never been betrayed  --  he had never given others an advantage over him  --  and had never found a need to hate nor been provoked to hatred . So , by first thinking of himself and serving himself , he could be kind and often just and solicitous to others . In short , Mr. Healey had had self-esteem , which was an entirely different thing from pride , for which Joseph had never wanted . A man who lived for " others " killed the only thing which was valid in a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Selfobliterationwas a crime against life . Joseph now held Sean and Regina as adversaries who had destroyed him , one with selfish cruelty , the other by finding Someone who needed her more than had her brother . " I do not understand you these days , " Bernadette complained . " You were never a fatuous husband or father at any time , nor attentive to mep349as are other husbands to their wives . Do you not know that I love you dearly , and need you and your strength and comfort ? You avoid me ; you rarely speak , never smile . Who else do I have but you ? " For an instant this shook Joseph out of his black thoughts and meditations . It was with harsh pity that he said to Bernadette : " Do n't be a fool ! Live for yourself , not for me or anyone else ! You have  --  yourself . That is more important than your husband or your children . Never be dependent on anyone for anything . That is disastrous . " Bernadette was taken aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What does a woman have but her family  --  her husband ? " Joseph had made a short but distracted gesture . " Think what that did to your mother , " he said , and left his wife , who , for the first time in her , young life felt the coldness of desolation , the terrible bleakness of it . Not even her father 's " defection , " as she called it , had stricken her like this . Her emotions , except for her passion for Joseph , were more or less superficial and explosive and short-lived , and could easily be placated or deflected . Now she wept as a woman and not as a child . Governor Tom Hennessey sent a brief telegram to his son-in-law . EXPECT ME IN GREEN BILLS ON THURSDAY INST FOR BUSINESS CONSULTATION . On reading this telegram Joseph smiled a little in exultation . He informed Bernadette who was aroused out of her own doldrums since that last conversation with her husband . ' We shall have a party ! " she exclaimed . But Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how long your father can remain with us . He may have to leave for Philadelphia almost at once . " A carriage was sent to the depot for the governor , and Bernadette was in it . She would talk to Papa privately before arriving back home , and he would , no doubt , explain to her exactly what Joseph had meant and how she could overcome it . But the governor was unusually taciturn with his daughter . He seemed pale and preoccupied , and there were deep clefts in his usually robust and florid face , and his eyes appeared turned inwards and haunted . He mumbled , " My darling , your husband is not a leisurely gallant nor dilettante nor idler . He has problems , like myself . Like myself , " he added , and looked at Bernadette impatiently , willing her to stop her chatter . " Did you think he has nothing to do but dance attendanceon you and play with your children ? A man 's life is apart from these , and greater than these , though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernadette 's small gloved hands , for she was about tocry . " Surely you remember what Byron said : Man 's love is of his lifep350apart . ' T is woman 's whole existence . ' It is quite true , and women should remember that and not prattle and complain . " " I only want him to love me , " Bernadette said , gulping down a sob . " I am sure he does , " said her father , and hoped to God that was somewhattrue . " Why else would he have married you ? He was rich in his own right , richer than I ever dreamed . He did not marry you for money . " ( What the hell had he married the girl for ? the governor asked himself , who had never been deceived that Joseph had felt any grand passion for Bernadette . ) He went immediately to Joseph 's rooms , and into the large room which Joseph now used as a study and which had once been the governor 's flamboyant bedroom . Joseph met him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , which the governor acceptedwith gratitude . " A large whiskey , " he said . " Perhaps you 'd better have one , too . I have bad news . " Joseph had never been an accomplished actor at any time . He thought , How did a man arrange his face so that it expressed apprehension  --  even if no apprehension was felt  --  and what did he put in his voice ? Joseph saw Mr. Montrose 's expressive countenance , and so made his own a passable facsimile of concern and attentive solicitude . He tried for Mr. Montrose 's flexibility of voice , and said , " Have you , then ? Then we must talk about it . Now . I hope it does not concern any punitive coming legislation against the alleged atrocities of the railroaders ? Do n't they understand that men do not run railroads so that the Molly Maguires and their fellow strikers and anarchists may live luxuriously , with no profits to the men who have risked everything ? And who had the brains to create railroads in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he smiled cynically , " Have n't I , at your suggestion , Joe , expressed my solicitude many times for those wretches ' and so got their votes  --  and managed to defeat any legislation which would help them ? " " So you have , " said Joseph . " What it is to be a politician ! I am glad I am not one . Lying is not exactly my forte . " The governor , sitting in the only comfortable chair in the stark study , narrowed his eyes at Joseph . Tom Hennessey was no fool . He had never liked Joseph , and had always suspected him without the slightest reason  --  objectively . All Joseph 's later politeness and political help had not overcome Tom 's memory of that night when Joseph had looked at him in the hall of this house after Katherine had died . Bernadette had told her father that Katherine had asked for Joseph . Tom always wondered why . Had it been something about Bernadette ? Had Joseph alreadyp351hinted so much to Katherine ? Yet he had looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and with such hatred , too . Of course , Katherine could have babbled to Joseph before she died  --  Tom had come to that conclusion . Katherine had always been a dim-witted fool . Tonight , Tom dismissed the unlamented Katherine from his thoughts . " I 'll make it brief , " he said , and his voice was rough with renewed agitation and now with open anger and despair . " I was informed , yesterday , by our Party that I would not receive the nomination this year . Yet , only a month ago I was assured of it by the State Chairman , himself . Who else ? " Joseph had seated himself nearby in the growing dusk of the room . The early autumn gardens outside sent up a poignant strong scent of mowed grass , chrysanthemums , late lilies and roses and crisping leaves . It was still falling daylight outside . Here it was becoming dim and shadowy , for great trees loomed outside and their tops brushed against the windows . Joseph , unusual for him , had mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it and looked at the floor , as if pondering . He said , " Now , why should they do that ? What do they have against you ? " Tom put down his glass with a thump on a nearby table . " Nothing ! " he shouted . " Have n't I done everything they suggested ? Have n't I followedall their directives ? I 've served the Party well , by God ! Now they turn on me . " He breathed heavily . " I 've even done some things  --  well , they were profitable for all concerned , but I took on the possible danger , myself . They profited more than I did . " Joseph shook his head . " I 'm not a politician , Tom . I do n't know the ways and the reasons of politicians . " Tom laughed cynically . " Oh , Joe . Do n't be so humble . You know damned well you are one of the big political powers in this Commonwealth . Just tell those bastards to change their minds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simple as that . They would n't dare cross you . " " I have heard hints , " said Joseph , " that they 'd prefer a younger man . Hancock , for one . After all , you are n't young any longer , Tom . And , you 've made your fortune . They take all that into consideration . " Tom studied him . Joseph 's air was entirely too disinterested . He had never been one to shilly-shally like this , to Tom 's knowledge . It was not in character . " Joe , " said the governor quietly . He 's an astute bastard , thought Joseph , and I am no actor . I am not even a good liar . He thought . Then he looked at Tom with an expres/sion he hoped was concerned and disarming . " All right , Tom . What do you want me to do ? " " I 've told you . Tell them to change their minds  --  or no more funds , no more bribery . " " I do n't bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts of appreciation . No one has any evidence of me bribing anyone . " " You took care of that , you and your Philadelphia lawyers , " said Tom , with mounting anger . He saw Joseph shrug his thin shoulders . He saw Joseph smile at him faintly . " Very well , " said Joseph . " I will write to them tonight . I hope it will help to change their minds . " " Telegraph , " said Tom Hennessey . " I hear they intend to nominate Hancock on Monday . There 's no time for writing . " " Very well , " Joseph repeated . He went to his desk and wrote for a few moments in his angular tight script . He brought the paper to Tom , who put on spectacles to read it . ALL CONTRIBUTIONS RECENTLY MADE ARE TO BE USED AS PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED IN BEHALF OF THE CANDIDATE HERETOFORE CHOSEN . JOSEPHARMAGH . Tom Hennessey scrutinized it . He wished it could have been warmer , more explicit , and that it had mentioned his name or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be prudent . He said , with some surprise , " I see you have already made a large contribution . " " Yes , very large . In August . After all , are you not the perennial candidate ? " " When you made that contribution you had no idea about  --  Han-cock ? " Joseph stood up . He looked at Tom with glittering blue eyes full of cold umbrage , and Tom was so frightened that he sat up in his chair and stared . Joseph said , " When did they mention Hancock to you ? " Tom 's full face , so sensual and brutal , trembled . " Monday , Joe . " When Joseph did not speak he cried , " Joe , I 'm sorry ! I am almost out of my mind . I see bogies everywhere . When will you send that telegram ? " His hands had become wet and cold . " At once , " said Joseph , and went to the bell rope . His whole attitude expressed rigid offense , and Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armagh , to whom he greatly owed his past elections . Tom said , with an attempt at a placating smile , rueful and affectionate , " Yes , I see bogies everywhere . Probably in Bernadette and your children , too , and Elizabeth ! " He tried to laugh . Then as relief flowedp353through him he laughed again , with real heartiness , and took up his drink . " That telegram will settle it , " he said . " I hope so , " said Joseph . A maid came into the room and Joseph directedthat she give the telegraph message to a groom , who was to take it to the depot at once . When the maid had left Tom said , his voice breaking , " I ca n't tell you what this means to me , Joe , and how grateful I am . I tell you , I 've been on the verge of apoplexy since Monday . I have scarcely slept or eaten . " Joseph considered him with those small hidden eyes which were so inexplicable . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the Bosom of your Family . " Joseph was unusually pleasant and amiable to Tom Hennessey at the dinner table that night , and Bernadette marveled , for she had never seen her husband so kind to her father before , nor so  --  almost  --  intimate . There had always been a reserve in Joseph towards Tom Hennessey , but now it appeared to have disappeared . She begged her father to remain " for a little festivity . " Tom , enormously relieved , flushed with wine and food , consented . Bernadette immediately began plans for a dinner party and a ball . " Very sudden , " she said . " But everybody will come . I will have the invitationsdelivered by hand tomorrow . Everybody will be so pleased . " Her round hazel eyes danced at Joseph with infinite love . Whatever her father 's hasty visit had portended Joseph had settled it , and dear Papa was so relaxed now , so comforted . He sat there as if this house still belonged to him , and in a way , reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of Elizabeth and that brat , and Mama 's last instructions . Joseph thought , Let the swine enjoy himself now and in the next days . It will be the last time . The condemned man 's final meal . He smiled at Tom and directed a maid to give his father-in-law more wine . Tom 's light eyes sparkled with satisfaction . Joseph waited . One week . Two weeks . As he waited he inwardly grew colder , and felt his own impatient exultation . He was not surprisedthat on the morning of the fifteenth day he received a telegramfrom his father-in-law : WILL ARRIVE TONIGHT AT FIVE . MUST SEE YOU ALONE , AT ONCE . Joseph crushed the telegram in his hand and smiled . He went to see Bernadette who was having her breakfast , as usual , in bed , her coverlet covered with jars of cosmetics , and perfumes , combs and brushes , mir/rors , crumbs and lace handkerchiefs . It was not often that Joseph came here during the day , and hardly more often at night , and Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her maid was laying out her morning attire , and a small fire burned to offset the early chill , though the day was brilliantly blue and sparkling outside . Bernadette 's curling rags were concealed by a lace cap with ribbons and she wore a bed jacket of blue silk and lace , and her plump arms lifted themselves eagerly to Joseph for a kiss . He was not sorry for his wife and what she would soon know . Bernadette , in her way , was as pragmatic as he and much more earthy and very practical . She loved her father still , and she would be greatly grieved , and I , thought Joseph , do n't care a damn . He stood by the bedsideand one of his hands was held by Bernadette and she was chattering , her hazel eyes darting and flashing with life and laughter , and Joseph thought how immediate she was and how her plans rarely ran beyond the day and the pleasures of it . He gathered she was going to tea with some friends in Green Hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wits , the motives , and the lives of all her friends apart , and with the utmost gaiety . Joseph found himself listening . She could make him laugh with her jokes and sallies and her witticisms , for none of them were kind and all of them struck very accurately on their intended targets . He could not remember Bernadettespeaking gently and kindly of anyone , except her father . She found her own children boring and annoying and had , thought Joseph , a hard hand on her in spite of her prattle about " the modern method of bringing up Our Precious Little Angels . " He neither loved her nor hated her . He did not like nor dislike her . Therefore he could almost always be temperate and detached with her , with no emotion whatsoever except occasional tedium . She might have been , to him , a dog of the household of which he was not fond and yet did not resent . Occasionally he found her body enticing , but he wanted no more children . He cared for Rory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since Regina 's desertion he had begun to consider Rory and even to listen to the childish remarks of Rory 's twin sister , Ann Marie . Joseph 's aloofness increased rather than decreased Bernadette 's devouringpassion for him . She thought it genteel and aristocratic , unlike her life-loving and very coarse father . He rarely kissed her and then only when in bed with her , and then he would not remain in her arms to sleep but left her in silence . She could not quarrel with him because of his indifference to her , which she had persuaded herself was mascu/line strength . ( " Dear Joseph is too deep for facile expressions and protestations and all the other trivialities . " ) Because he was too uninterestedin women , Bernadette would think , she had no occasion for jealousy when he was often away for weeks at a time , and even when in Green Hills he usually remained only two days out of a week . She never knew that he preferred the expensive trollops of Philadelphia and New York to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beauty , a successful young actress in the latter city , an Irish girl with a delectableface and figure and a glorious singing voice . Joseph took no effort to conceal his adulteries from his wife nor did he flaunt them . He did not care if she guessed . It was nothing to him , as Bernadette was nothing to him . Once he had felt a faint compassion for her on the night of her mother 's death , because she was young and abandoned and wet with tears and sweat , and frantic , but he felt no pity for her now , and never the slightest tenderness . Had she discovered any of his affairs and if she had reproached him he would not have been angered or ashamed . He would have said to her , " What is it to you ? What are you to me ? " She was aware of Joseph as she had never been aware of anyone before , and she had noticed how even more gaunt he had become since " that horrible Regina left here like a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taut , his eyes more secret , and the shadow of gray more pronounced in his thick russet hair . The planes of his face were sharp and angular , the hollows under his cheekbones deeper , his complexion paler . But he never spoke of Regina as he never spoke of Sean . It was as if they had not lived at all. - He said to her when her chatter slowed a little , " I have a telegram from your father , Bernadette . He is making an unexpected visit to me , tonight , on business . He will arrive at five . " Bernadette 's face gleamed with delight , and her white teeth flared . " Oh , how wonderful , and he was only here a short time ago ! I must send my regrets to Bertha Holleye , about the tea  --  " " No , " said Joseph . " That would be rude , would n't it ? " He looked about the crowded gaudy room which had once been Katherine 's , and he remembered the night of her death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here only an hour or so before you return . I think he has some very important news for me . " Bernadette flapped a little fat hand . " Oh , he wants to tell you he has been nominated again ! Is that such news ? But , I suppose it will call for a party for our friends , to celebrate , as usual . " She looked up at Joseph and there was something about him which vaguely disturbed her . " There 's nothing wrong with Papa , is there , Joe ? "  |p356Jose|ph  said , " Why should there be anything wrong ? " " Well , then , is it about your business  --  all your business matters ? " Joseph looked down into her adoring eyes . " I would n't be surprised in the least , " he said . " I am pretty sure it is my business . " " There 's nothing wrong with that , either , is there , Joe ? " Like all the rich who had never known destitution or privation money was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard with all the resources of one 's mind and vigilance against anything or anyone which could diminish it by a penny . So Bernadette stared at Joseph with those round and somewhat bulging eyes and she no longer smiled . " Not a thing wrong with my business , my pet , " said Joseph . He looked at her curiously . " You are a very rich woman yourself , Bernadette , in your own right . And you are getting richer . Why should you worry about my affairs ? " " No one is ever rich enough ! " she said , with passionate emphasis , and slapped her breakfast tray so all the china jumped . " Papa once said you were the richest man in Pennsylvania . That is n't enough . I want you to be the richest man in the country ! " Then she laughed . " Rich as Mr. Gould , Mr. Fisk and Mr. Vanderbilt and Mr. Morgan and Mr. Regan , and all the rest . Richer . " Joseph 's eyes narrowed so that there was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy you ? " he asked , with greater curiosity . " More jewels , more Worth gowns , more journeys to Europe , more horses , carriages , houses , servants ? " " Just to have it , " said Bernadette . " That 's all . Just to have it . " " But why ? " She was fondly exasperated and took his hand again . " Joe , why do you keep on making money ? " " Just to have it , " he mimicked her , and then when she laughed he did not smile but left the room . She lay back on her pillows , oddly and namelessly dismayed . He had looked at her as at an enemy , or as if he had hated her or thought her ridiculous . Bernadette was not very subtle , though she was acute . She chewed thoughtfully on a little jam-covered biscuit . Then she said to herself : Do n't be absurd . Joe loves me . But he is very strange . I do n't always understand him . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new thought came to Bernadette and she sat up quickly . Would Joseph have cared that much if it had been herself who had left , she , the mother of his children ? She saw Joseph 's face again . Her love tried to blind and dazzle her.  |p357But  she rarely lied to herself as she lied to others . She said aloud , " No , he would n't have cared that much . " Again she felt that bleak desolationwhich had wounded her before . When the maid came to take away the tray Bernadette slapped her smartly on the cheek then burst into tears . All the household knew Joseph 's moods , though he invariably seemed restrained , silent , never raising his voice , never speaking roughly or too quickly , never complaining . But the strength of his personality was such that he projected his mental climate without a word or a glance . So the great house was unusually quiet this day . The children stayed with their governess , the aging Miss Faulk , and Timothy Dineen found it necessary to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in a trap , and the servants moved softly and spoke in subdued voices . The white mansion stood in the crisp bright air of autumn under its fading trees and every window was bright , but it seemed to be abandoned . The red calla lilies , the chrysanthemums in their beds , the very late roses , bent in the shining wind , but there was no other movement outside , and no sign of any groom or gardener 's boy . The only sound was the dry crackling of dying leaves and then the sudden screech of a bluejay or the shattering sound of a delayed woodpecker against a trunk , or the distant stamping of a horse in its stall . Bernadette , looking dejected , had gone to her tea . Joseph waited in his rooms . Never had time crept so slowly on sluggishfeet . He kept glancing at his watch . Twenty after five . Twentyfiveafter . Half-past five . He heard hoofs and wheels and he stood up and looked through the window and saw the glittering black family victoria moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph opened a cabinet , then , and laid out whiskey and glasses and soda and rang the bell for the butler . " Governor Hennessey 's luggageshould be taken to his room but I should like to confer with him as soon as possible , in my study . " He rearranged the neatness of his plain white cuffs , and then his cravat , and rubbed his hands over his thick hair . He looked tall and black and deadly in the quiet room . There was an ice-cold exultation in him . He had destroyed worthier men than Governor Hennessey in his surge to power and money , but he had done it with no animosity at all , no feeling of vengeance or triumph . It was only business . But this was vengeance indeed , a personal vendetta , a focusing of loathing and enmity and hate long in the gestation , long in the gathering . The arrogantand swaggering governor , seemingly invulnerable , had become vulnerable and had been destroyed.  |p358Jose|ph  made himself sit down and open a book . He heard the butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he who never mumbled  --  and then heard the quick but stumbling footsteps up the stairs and down the long hall to Joseph 's rooms . The governor appeared on the threshold and Joseph rose , his face shut and without expression . Tom Hennessey , large , overfleshed , flamboyant and impressive , now appeared disheveled and soiled , hasty and sweaty . All his color was gone . His face was like cracked plaster , quivering , his sensual mouth hanging loose , his chin uncertain , his forehead glazed and wet . Always immaculate , " the glass of fashion , " he seemed unbuttoned and roughenednow . There was a wild agitation about him , a trembling uncertainty , a desperate upheaval . His light eyes , always cynical and domineering , now had a distraught and leaping shine . His longish brown and gray hair , usually carefully combed and cajoled into waves , hung over his cheeks and neck and forehead , tangled and ungroomed . Joseph said , " How are you , Tom ? Was your train late ? " The governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he had never seen this room or this man before , and did not know where he was . He took an aimless step or two , towards the windows , back again , then to one side . He stood at last behind a chair and gripped its back and looked at Joseph , and his breath was grating and noisy in the sunlit room . " They have ruined me , " he said , and his voice was thick and unsure . Joseph saw that his eyes were deeply bloodshot as if he had been drinking . His cheeks puffed out and in as he breathed . He did not look away from Joseph . He repeated , " They have ruined me . " " Who ? " said Joseph and came closer to his father-in-law . The governor raised one formidable forefinger , and then it wobbled and drooped and his hand fell to his side . " I will find out , and I will cut their throats , " he said with the utmost malignancy . His eyes jumped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please sit down , Tom , " said Joseph and hoped that he was conveyingsolicitude . He took his father-in-law 's shivering big arm and forced him into the chair he had been clutching . " Let me get you a drink . Then you must tell me about it . " " A drink , " said the governor , and he croaked as if choking . " That 's all I have been doing for two days and two nights . But give me a drink , and a large one , " and he coughed , strangling . He tried to drop his exhausted head against the back of the chair but he was so distracted that it immediately bounced forward and he clenched his fists on thep359arms of the chair and his breathing was very loud and audible . " God damn them , " he said . " Oh , my God , curse them ! But I 'm not finished with them yet ! No one ever got the better of Tom Hennessey ! " Joseph put a glass half full of whiskey into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom drank deeply , gluttonously , as if the glass held the elixir of life and strength . He inhaled raucously . His heavy shoulders visibly shook . He looked at the glass . Then he glanced up at Joseph with his reddened eyes , like the eyes of a tormented bull , and he said , " You have n't heard ? " " No , " said Joseph . " I have n't even seen any newspapers this past week . I 've had too much work here in Green Hills . But , what is wrong ? Who has ruined you ? " The governor became still . He looked up at Joseph and those eyes fixed themselves on the younger man as if he had suddenly sensed somethingdireful , something not quite in focus or apparent . He watched Joseph as he said , " You must know that though the Party gave out the idea that they were going to nominate me after all , they did n't . Day beforeyesterday they told me finally it was going to be Hancock . " Joseph frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered his boots . He compressed his lips , slightly shook his head . He said , " They did not tell me . " " Not you ? Not the biggest contributor to the Party ? Not you who named the five state senators last year , and got them elected ? They never told you , wrote you , telegraphed you ? " The governor sat upright in his chair , and panted , but did not look away . " No , " said Joseph , " they never told me . " Now he turned his face to Tom and Tom saw his fierce concentrated eyes , his implacable face , the blade of his mouth and the white tension of his nose , and he misinterpreted them . He said , " I do n't understand it . You , of all people . " His voice was broken and rusty . " My son-in-law . " He drank again , took the glass from his thick mouth and groaned . " But , you can do something , even now . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't too late . " Then his face sagged . " Yes , it is too late . " He put down his glass with a crash on the desk and rubbed his hands over and over his shaken face as if he were washing it . " It 's too late . I forgot . There 's worse . " His shoulders heaved under his creased fawn coat . He bent his face in his rubbing hands and Joseph thought he was weeping . All the strong muscles and the fat of the great body visibly shrank , as though disintegrating . Now he was no longer the buoyant and commanding  |p360governor  of the Commonwealth , the former colorful senator of the United States of America , the owner of enormous wealth and power . He was a shattered old man , wrecked , thrown down , dismantled , full of bewilderment and despair and an agony he had never known before in his life , and a sense of demented incredulity . He felt another glass being pressed against the back of one of the massaging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass and fumbled it to his lips and the liquid went partly into his mouth and partly down his chin , dribbling . Joseph watched him and the quiet ferocity of his face deepened . He said , " You have n't told me . What is worse ' ? " The awful eyes , robbed of all humanity by anguish , disbelief , and torture , glared at Joseph . The large features were convulsed , misshapen . " Worse ! " he said . " They  --  know everything . It is n't just Washington , though that 's bad enough in their hypocritical eyes . Oh , God help me , God help me ! Since I was governor  --  Joe , you know yourself . You profited . The state contracts , roads , bridges , right of ways , government buildings . All of it . Yes , I profited , too . But they did , more than I. More than even you . I did what they told me to . I obeyed every suggestion . I never objected . I was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Joseph , blood flecked , mad . " Do you know what they told me yesterday ? That I was , in my way , the head of a Tweed Ring , here in this Commonwealth ! They dared to tell me that ! Who profited most ? They did ! Do you hear me , they did ! " " Yes , " said Joseph . " But , can you prove it ? " " Prove it ! " shouted the governor in a roaring voice . " Of course I canHe stared at Joseph . " Can you ? How ? " " The contractors  --  " " The contractors are men making a living , and they can be intimidatedby politicians as you know only too well , Tom . Do you think they will confess to the influence and the threats and the promises that were brought to bear on them ? And so hang themselves , or at least be forced into bankruptcy and litigation and prosecution ? And , perhaps , even be murdered ? We all know what politicians are , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gravity . " But I 'm sure our friends told you that , yesterday , did n't they ? " Tom 's big fingers smoothed themselves over and over the empty glass . He licked the drops of whiskey on his mouth . He was shakingp361as if struck by a powerful wind . " Yes , " he whispered , " they did , that . But I thought you would help me . " Joseph sighed . " I 'm no Samson , Tom , and neither are you . We can make an effort to show who really profited . I have a battery of lawyers in Philadelphia and they are ferrets . They could find out  --  though they 'd put themselves into physical peril , as they 'd know . We can appeal to the Attorney General , himself . We can appeal to muckrakers and zealous reformers in the Commonwealth . I can print accusations in my newspapers , and screaming editorials . And , what will it amount to ? If your  --  friends  --  are indicted , so will you be , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , robbing the people . That 's what they 'd call it , would n't they ? And it would be the truth . " He smiled a little . " The other Party would be out of its mind with delight  --  if we told them . We could testify under promised immunity . State 's evidence . Corruption , malfeasance , theft , graft , spoils , intimidationof contractors to the state , looting , exploitation of labor , inferior materials at the highest prices , subornation , perjury . Everything . Of course , we could plead , ourselves , that we were intimidated , threatened . Do you think the people would believe it ? You , the rich governor , I , the financier and what not ? Come , Tom . " " I do n't care  --  " whispered the desperate governor . " I see . Something like from Macbeth : ' I am one , my liege , ' who am so incensed  --  or something  --  concerning the world that ' I am reckless what I do to spite the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail ? Or , at the very least , to be dishonored and outcast , forever ? Do you think the other Party will take you to its bosom in gratitude ? We all know the worth of politicians ' gratitude , do n't we ? " The blood-hazed eyes did not leave him . But a maddened speculation had begun to gleam in them . Tom said in a clearer voice , " You do not know it all , Joe . They have told me I have to make ' recompense . ' That I must return ' the money ' to the Commonwealth . With interest , with ' judicial and righteous penalties . ' They told me . It will take almost all the money I have , all my investments . Everything . They have even shown me documents from Washington  --  They have even  --  forgeddocumentsshowing the source of the Hennessey money . Blackbirding . Things like that . Only part of the money , they told me , will be returned to the Commonwealth . The rest  --  " " Is for them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " But Tom Hennessey did not reply . He was studying Joseph as he hadp362never studied friend nor enemy before , with all the concentration and power of his intellect , which was not small , and all his intuition , all his Irish subtlety . Still watching with the complete focusing of his mind he said , " Yes , Joe . That bold . Something , somebody , is behind it . They would n't be that bold without orders . " Joseph looked deeply into the eyes below him . He said , " They ca n't take everything . They wo n't take everything . You still have Katherine 's money . You still have your wife 's money . It is enough to keep you in modest circumstances , in your house in Philadelphia . Anything is preferable to scandal , exposure , indictment , prosecution , jail . Is n't it ? Anything is preferable to living in fear , is n't it ? In the end you 'd be better off financially by not fighting these  --  atrocious  --  demands . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to poverty , Tom . I know lawyers . " " You are asking me to do nothing at all ? " Tom was slowly rising from his chair , clutching the arms and back . " You are asking me to do that ? " " I am advising you , " said Joseph . " And  --  you will do nothing  --  to help me ? " Neither of the two men saw Bernadette , all black velvet and lace and bangles and veiled hat and gloves , on the threshold . She had just appeared . She had run happily up the stairs to greet her father , and her face still held the fading remnants of a smile , the mouth half-open and upturned , the eyes flashing , the hand outheld . But she had come upon her husband and her father , confronting each other , and the sharp Bernadette had suddenly known that here was not a friendly family discussion but two adversaries . She felt the hatred in the room , the feral smell of deadly enmity . She had known instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other was the maddener , ruthless and terrible . She had heard their last words . Her hand slowly fell to her side and she had a sensation of giddiness and terror . She could hardly recognize her father in this broken man , whose potencywas dwindling before her eyes , whose hair was disheveled , whose clothes were soiled and untidy , whose head was bent like the head of a dying bull stopped in his charge . She could not recognize her husband in this lean stiff man with the vindictive smile , the narrowed eyes , the contracted muscles held as if about to strike . She put her hand to her mouth , an unusually feeble gesture for Bernadette . " I will do nothing to help you , " said Joseph in the softest voice . " Not even if your life depended on it . " Tom Hennessey pondered on that . He looked about him vaguely ,  |p363and  now Bernadette could see his inflamed and bloody eyes which did not see her at all . Tom put his hand to his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " he muttered . " Nothing to help you . Not to save your life , Tom . " Tom put his hands to his throat and moved his big head . He gasped . He did not look away from Joseph . There was now a deep crimson flush on his forehead , a rising of thickened veins in his neck . " Why ? " he asked . " Katherine , " said Joseph . " Katherine , " Tom repeated , in a dull low tone . " Katherine . What had she to do with you ? " " Nothing . It was what you did to Katherine . " Tom 's gaze fixed itself with renewed intensity on Joseph . The crimsonflush was deepening . He slowly raised his right hand and pointed at Joseph . " Now I remember , " he said , and his voice was very choked . " You were a lad . You  --  you had been looking at this house . I knew I 'd remember sometime . A dirty shanty Irisher . That 's all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shanty Irish . A beggar . You plotted it all . From the beginning . You  --  took my daughter . It was all part of it . All part of it . Dirty shanty Irish . " He stopped and groaned and panted . He said , " Katherine . Yes , I remember . You were always  --  It was Katherine . You waited a long time , Irish . " " I waited a long time , " said Joseph . " But Katherine never knew . On the night she died she asked me to marry your daughter . It was her wish . And so I did . " Tom saw his face and for the first time in his life he shuddered beforeanother man . He lifted his arms and clenched his fists . He staggeredtowards Joseph beating his hands impotently , blindly , in the air . He fell forward , stumbling , reeling . Bernadette uttered a thin shriek . Tom fell upon Joseph , still flailing . Then , instinctively , for he felt the older man sagging and collapsing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then held Tom Hennessey , fallen against his chest , arms hanging . It was then that Joseph saw Bernadette . He did not care what she had heard or what she had seen . He said to her , " Help me to put your father in a chair . " But Tom was unconscious now . He slipped out of the chair in which they put him , Bernadette all the while crying and half-screaming and slapping her gloved hands together in distraction . Tom lay on the floorp364between them with a suffused face , breathing stertorously , his eyes half open . " You killed my father ! " Bernadette shrieked . " What did you do to my father ? " " Ring for someone , " said Joseph . " Send for a doctor , and some of the grooms and we 'll put your father to bed . " His voice was cold and neutral . Bernadette stopped her crying . Shestared at her husband , blinking , big tears on her smooth golden cheeks . " I heard , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " said Joseph , though he again felt a dim pity for her , " I neverdid . But there is nothing we can do about it now , is there ? " The doctor , and other doctors summoned from Philadelphia and even Pittsburgh , said that the governor had had a stroke , that his whole left side was paralyzed , that he would probably never speak again nor leave his bed . It was possible that he would not be fully aware or conscious of his surroundings from this time on , and must have constant nursing . He could not be moved . His life depended on it . Bernadette , pale and quiet , said , " This is my father 's house . He will stay in it as long as he lives , and I will never leave him . Send for his wife  --  and her child . " So Toni Hennessey had returned to his house and would remain there until he died . Joseph found a profound irony in this . He could even laugh quietly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grief-stricken Elizabeth , whom Bernadette hated . Elizabeth 's little boy , Courtney , joined Rory and Ann Marie in the nursery . Bernadette wanted to say to Elizabeth , to wound her , " My husband killed your husband , " but her helpless and now devastated love for Joseph prevented her . No matter what Joseph did , to her , to anyone else , her besottedness was not shaken though she now feared him . Her mother : Had Joseph really loved her mother ? Yes , it was so . She , Bernadette , must live with that all her life . Joseph 's newspaper in Philadelphia expressed its sorrow for " the stricken governor , " and prayed for his recovery . When Tom Hessessey died two years later  --  after an existence which had held no awareness of love or hatred or money or influence or power or even living  --  he was eulogized in the press as " the greatest and most humane Governor this Commonwealth has ever known . The defenderof the weak , the upholder of the workingman , the staunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption and exploitation , the patriot , the farsighted politician who had Dreams of a noblerp365America  --  this was Governor Thomas Hennessey , who was stricken down at the height of his struggle for the Nation . We grieve with his family . We pray for his soul . " Tom was buried beside his wife , who had loved him . While in New York Joseph 's friends said to him during a discreet meeting : " It would be impolitic for any of us , except you , Mr. Armagh , to approach Senator Enfield Bassett personally . The cartoonists are too favorable to him and he has only to lift a finger for them to lampoon anyone who tries  --  er  --  to talk reasonably to him . He did it with the more obstreperous of the Greenbackers , though they had to be careful there , considering that both the conservative Democrats and the more moderateRepublicans opposed them . " " I remember , " said Joseph . " The radical Republicans joined with the Greenbackers , but we soon eliminated them from politics . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria-Hungary , smiling . " We were entirely against the gold standard for America , and helped your innocent President Lincoln to issue greenbacks to pay for his war , though there was no solid currency behind them . We had our hopes , then , that your government would continue to issue fiat money instead of gold currency  --  for that is the sure way to  --  reorganize  --  a country . " " Make it available for loot , " said Joseph , who was not always deferentialto his colleagues . " Money by government fiat , not ' backed by gold and silver , inevitably bankrupts a country , does n't it ? But I thought you gentlemen were in accord that America was not yet ripe for total looting and for the introduction of Marxist Socialistic principles . " He smiled at them with what they had long ago called his " tiger smile . " " I am afraid , " he said , " that you will have to wait a considerable time beforeAmerica goes off the gold standard again , becomes Socialistic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by arms then by bankers . Yes  --  a considerable time before America becomes the slave of the Elite . Perhaps , however , your sons  --  " " We have no time limits , " said another gentleman . ' We are patient . " Another gentleman said , " Republics never survive , for their people do not like freedom but prefer to be led and guided and flattered and seduced into slavery by a benevolent , or not so benevolent , despot . They want to worship Caesar . So , American republicanism will inevi/tably die and become a democracy , and then decline , as Aristotle said , into a despotism . We can only work quietly and diligently for that day , for it is our nature , " and he laughed a little . " No sensible man can endureto see fools voting in a free election , and deciding a nation 's destiny for themselves . It goes against reason and right government . It is the highest and most distorted absurdity . " " Still , " said Joseph , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third term , and called him Caesar . " " We have said , " said a gentleman from Russia , " that America is not ripe at this time either for democracy and her child , despotism . But the time will come . We will succeed in persuading your government to go off the gold standard and issue greenbacks by fiat . One way is through wars , but we have other methods , as you know , Mr. Armagh . Revolution , for instance , persuading the people that they are oppressed , and inciting incendiarism . " " Catilina did that , " said Joseph . " It seems to me that he was slaughtered . " " He was before his time , " said a gentleman from England . " Forty years later he would have succeeded . Now , in your country , we have only to turn your conservative Democrats into radicals , a hard task , but we may succeed . In defense , your radical Republican Party will have to become more conservative . This will confuse the people . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of Senator Bassett now confronts us . " Joseph thought of the time , only four years ago , when the strikers against the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad in Maryland had desperately rebelledagainst a reduction in their miserable pay of ten percent . On July zo , 1877 , the governor had called out the 6th Maryland Militia , who marched to the railroad station , fired on the strikers and their wives and children and killed twelve people . But the strike had spread to Pittsburgh , where the Pennsylvania Railroad had also cut wages . GovernorHessessey had ordered out the militia and there fifty-eight strikers , and soldiers , had died in furious pitched battles , and millions of dollars ' worth of railroad property had been destroyed . But the Great Strike , born of the terrible depression of 1877 , and nourished by starvation and wretchedly small wages , spread all over the country . President Rutherford Hayes had finally halted it , but not until the railroad barons had been forced to concede a little and had reduced a working day from fourteen hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford enough bread for their children , and meat once or twice a month . Joseph remembered that a large number of the strikers had been Irish/men , the Molly Maguires , fresh from the " ould sod , " who had found the railroaders little different from their English landlords . However , they had been seduced by the slogan that in America there was no differencebetween races and religions , and that a man could practice his faith in peace . Perhaps their disillusion had fired their desperate rioting and not only the incredibly low wages . Joseph smiled grimly , and his colleagues , who thought him a capricious man and not entirely " solid , " saw that smile though they were unaware of the reason . Joseph thought : There are other ways of revenge than rioting and striking . He said , " Our new President , Mr. James Garfield , has said that he will institute new reforms in this country . " The others exchanged discreet glances . Mr. Jay Regan , the New York financier , said gently , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Or , if not , he can be assassinated , " said Joseph , and laughed his disagreeablelaugh . " Like Mr. Lincoln . " He saw their coldly affronted faces , and laughed again . " Gentlemen , " he said , " I am not against judiciousmurder , as you know . But we were speaking of Senator Bassett . He is a Republican , but not a radical like our Reconstruction fanatics and our shouting congressmen and senators , therefore the conservative Democrats also voted with him in considerable numbers . The President likes him , and consults him . They may be hatching schemes deleterious to us . That is what you fear , is n't it ? " " True , " said Mr. Regan , and shifted his heavy belly in his chair and lit a cigar . " Gentlemen , " he said to the others , " Mr. Armagh and I are Americans , and so we are blunt and prefer to nail a subject down and not dance a minuet or a waltz about it . " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , at this point , Mr. Regan . But we do know that Senator Bassett is leading the coalition against foreign contract labor , and trying to force through an Alien Contract Labor bill , which will prohibit the importation of cheap labor from Europe to work in your mills and mines and factories . The senator is listening too much to the criminal unions in America , and to sobbing sympathizers , and to reformers . ' And other senators , and congressmen , too , are listening to Senator Bassett and his mobs . We all know that if alien labor is halted American labor will become arrogant and overweeningand demand impossible wages and conditions , and that will be the end of American progress and wealth . You will not be able to compete in foreign markets . Our own profits will be fearfully diminished . Besides "  --  and he looked at the Americans  --  " does not America need more and more immigrants ? Think of your vast Territories to thep368West , lacking cities and factories and industry . Must they be deprived of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Joseph . This was the sort of remark , uttered with quiet irony , that disturbed his colleagues , even Mr. Regan , who had a great affection for him . " It has been the experience of America , " said Joseph , " that alien labor does not move West in any quantity , but huddles in the warrens of the Eastern cities . Which , of course , is our plan in any event . If they moved West to open the Territories , who would work in our mills , mines , and factories ? Gentlemen , let us be rough and honest , and not use sanctimoniouswords . We want alien labor because , it is very cheap , and becauseAmerican labor is demanding the right to live , too . That is intolerable to us . Let us proceed from that honest premise . " He saw secret cold eyes , calculating , but he knew he was safe from them . His knowledge made him invulnerable . Besides , Mr. Regan , the Morgans , the Fisks , the Belmonts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villains but they had an American sense of humor also , and not an overpowering affection for their European colleagues . They would plot with them , but they would always have some peculiar sardonic reservation . They would plan to destroy American freedom and establish themselves as the Elite  --  as the others planned for their own countries  --  but they would do it with urbanity and self-mocking hypocrisy . It would all be the same in the end , but the means were gayer and not icily cynical and bloodless . The words of Mr. Vanderbilt , " The hell with the public , " would prevail , but the public would well know the sentiments of their coming rulers , and their presentones , and might even smile at their raucous effrontery . It was the deadly men , who spoke in low tones of " human rights " and " **27;14141;TOOLONG "  --  while they methodically looted , and endlessly plotted against human freedom and human dignity  --  who were execrable . But , thought Joseph , would a nation prefer a jovial executioner to a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His experience with politicians had so convinced him . Well , America chose her own politicians , not on the basis of worth and honor and manliness and probity , but on their smiles , their public good-nature , their appearance , the people 's own emotionalism , their own excited delusions . Joseph thought of his son , Rory , handsome , enchanting , humorous , gay , and witty  --  a born equivocator and , of course , a politician . " Always lie , always be charming , " Joseph had told his son . " Americans adore delightfulpitchmen . " Rory was not quite nine , but he was extremelyp369intelligent , an attribute Joseph was later to tell him not to display before the American electorate . " Americans suspect too much intellect , " he would say . " They prefer a glittering clown . You must learn to kiss babies and have a throb in your throat , and if you can have tears in your eyes and a smile on your lips simultaneously the public will go mad over you . " " If Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Regan , " it will be the end of American expansion , and the end of profits . Labor , if in short supply , can enforce impossible demands . It is as simple as that . So , Senator Bassett must be  --  persuaded . Other senators hold him in the highest regard . " " So Senator Bassett must lose that regard , " said Joseph . " What skeletondoes he have in his closet ? " " None that we can find , and we have sought , " said Mr. Regan . " He has led a life of the utmost virtue . " The others smiled bleakly . " He has never taken graft . He has never had a mistress . When he was congressmanhe refused the spoils . He is not a rich man . He owns farms and pays his workers high wages , incredible wages . His wife is a Southern lady  --  " " That ought to be enough to swing the radical Republicans away from him , " said Joseph . ( That was another sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't we bring it up that due to his wife the senator never helped loot the South the way the Reconstruction boys did ? " Mr. Regan coughed a little , but his eyes , ambushed under his thick brown brows , twinkled . " Unfortunately , the conservative Democrats and the conservative Republicans have noted that fact with approval . " Joseph said with politeness , " Has anyone considered murdering him ? " Mr. Regan laughed . " That would only inflame those who are with him , Joseph . Well , it seems in your pocket , my boy . We have decided that you , who have never been conspicuous , should try to persuade the senator . You have shown more discretion than others of us . " " I gather , " said Joseph , " that Senator Bassett is well informed about the labor situation in America . He cried for the impeachment of the Governors of Maryland and Pennsylvania , who brought out the militia against the railroad workers . He is no tyro , no radical . We ca n't bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Or , " he added in a meditativevoice , " can we ? " " I think we have told you that there is nothing . He is a mountain of the Christian virtues . "  | " There is always something , " said Joseph . " I will set my men to work at once . " He looked at the men around the great oval table and saw their intent eyes . " There is no man alive , gentlemen , who does not have something to conceal , large or small . If small , then it can be blown up to gigantic proportions . It is easy to make even a saint into a mountebank , a deceiver , a betrayer of the people , if one is clever enough . I think my men are very clever . " Four weeks later Joseph went to Washington , which he called " a white ship on a sea of mud and fog . " He hated its smells of sewers , its heat , its spiritual atmosphere of corruption and slyness and expediency and spoils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that similar avenues in France had led to the easy looting and insurrectionsand assassinations by the Parisian mobs , for no walls or turnings had impeded them , nor had soldiers any means of ambush . We do n't , thought Joseph , as yet have a Rousseau or a Mirabeau or a Robespierre , nor are we as yet infected by communes as were the French revolutionariesand their rich leaders . But , thanks to my friends , we will most likely have them in the future , in the lifetime of my sons or my sons ' sons . Joseph detested Washington , which amused his friends , for was he not part of its corruption , venality , and spoils ? Had he not used senators and congressmen with cynicism ? They did not know of his ambiguous probity , for he was hardly aware of it , himself . For instance , he had not rushed eagerly to invest heavily in munitions during the FrancoPrussianWar , in which his friends had made combined billions . He had liked neither combatants , though at one time he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , were not his friends plotting to infuse Marxism into all nations for their destruction and bankruptcy , so that they could be silently conquered and ruled by the Elite ? When something could not be reconciled in his mind he suppressedit as irrelevant . He had rooms in the Lafayette Hotel , a modest hostelry , for at all times , unlike some of the more flamboyant entrepreneurs , he avoided ostentation and the public eye . His tastes were austere . He did not like gleaming carriages and fine horses . So his invisibility was not strategy but nature . That it immeasurably helped him did not occur to him , though it did to his colleagues . However , politicians usually knew when he was in town , and some were anticipatory and some were uneasy . Senator Bassett was a resolute man , but he was disturbed at the news . When Joseph Armagh appeared hides had a habit of becomingp371raw  --  or were groomed to glossiness . Senator Bassett doubted that if he should encounter Joseph he would be groomed , though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , was ominous , as the senator'sfriends had informed him . " He is one of the prime movers against the Alien Contract Labor bill , " the senator was told . " He moves quietly and without overt noise , but he is there just the same . " " I will wait , " said the senator . " My God , how I hate these **27;14170;TOOLONG ! They are worse than the elected ones , for they controltoo many of us . I thank God that senators are appointed by State Legislatures and so never have to run for office like the unfortunate congressmen . I hope senators are never elected by direct vote of the people , for the people are volatile and can easily be misled by a smile or a wink or a few coppers in their hands , and , above all , by grandiose promises . " " Joe Armagh is one of the chief promoters of a Constitutional Amendmentto elect senators by direct vote of the people , and to stop their appointment by State Legislators only . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator , in a stern voice . ' We 'd be redundant , then , which is probably the whole plot anyway . And we 'd be the creatures of the politicians just as the congressmen are . " Senator Enfield Bassett was from Massachusetts . He was a small but compact man with a great head , too large for his frame . He gave the impression , in spite of his stature , of considerable strength of body and mind . He had a big and vital face , kind and very intelligent and eloquent , and was forty-five years old . He did not wear a beard but only a very curly mustache which he vainly tried to straighten with wax . His hair , somewhat short , had that tendency also , and he lavishly used oil on it . His eyes were beautiful , large , black , and expressive , with long silken lashes . There was something about them , however , which disturbedhis friends . They were never known to harden or grow too intentor piercing , but always shone with humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually generous , and he had fine white teeth . If there was a slight inclination to the rococo in his attire his friends loved him for it . They knew that this did not extend to rococo judgments , but that always he was balanced , thoughtful , sincereand moderate . Above all things he was adamant against the exploitationof American labor , its agonies , its unjust oppression and misery  --  and against the importation of alien labor which was willing to work for almost nothing in its wretchedness and so cripple American labor.  | " I am not against Europeans , " he would say , " for are we not all Europeans ? But I am against the importation of foreign labor which is brought here in cattle boats , sick and starving and diseased , not to be succored and helped by compassionate ' owners  --  and do they not act like owners ?  --  but to be driven into our mills and factories and mines like beasts , there to work until they die on their feet  --  and then are buried in unknown graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world outside those stockades . Their wives and their children are pressed into service . Their lot is terrible , unconscionable , not to be endured in any Christian nation . Their fate is far worse here than in their native countries . At least there they had a little land . What have they here ? Nothing but servitude . They never see a copper of their earnings . It goes to company stores for their meager needs . " The time has come , my friends , when we must practice what we preach . We say we are a free nation . But , are those who are imported here like cattle free ? We must stop such importation . Henceforth those who come to our shores must be free men , willing to assume the responsibilitiesof freedom , proud men with trades and with skills , and not mute creatures willing to work to their deaths for a little bread and unmarked graves . Thank God we have abolished open slavery . Let us now abolish covert slavery . No entrepreneur must henceforth be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detriment of our own people , who demand a decent wage and a decent shelter . " " Progress , " said his opponents . " Shall we close the doors to our country to the wretched , the serfs , the meek ? " Senator Bassett knew who " owned " those politicians . No man owned him . It had been , in its way , a miracle that he had been selected by his State Legislature for his office . " An oversight , " he would say wryly . " They must have just come from church . " This was the man of integrity that Joseph Armagh had arrived to suborn . He did nothing overt . He asked two senators to extend an invitation to Senator Bassett to meet him , " in the interests of mutual concern . " The invitation was extended . Senator Bassett believed in the aphorism that a man should know his enemy , the better to judge him and to overcomehim . So he agreed to have dinner with Joseph in the privacy of the latter 's rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1881 , tropical , dripping with moisture though the sun shone and there had been no rain ; fetid , stinking of sewage , fouled dust , horse droppings , stagnant water , and rotting vegetation , and other smells which could not be definedbut were rank . The hotel was not situated in a fashionablep373quarter and the bricked street was narrow and , as usual in Washington , blowing with scattered filth in a hot wind . Across the street stood endlessrows of what Joseph called " terrace houses , " from his memory of the towns in Ireland , that is , attached houses of a dull reddish stone with tiny smeared windows and painted doorways on flagged or wooden walks . The windows of Joseph 's rooms were open and the curtains blew in and out and the velvet draperies were dusty . There was constant traffic ; the rattle of steel-rimmed wheels invaded the rooms and the clopping of horses and the barking of stray dogs . The rooms were small , plushy and very hot , and some of the crowded furniture was of horsehair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some surprise . This hotel seemed hardly the place for one like Joseph Armagh and for a moment the senator thought that this must be secretiveness . Then he studied his host and saw his good but austere clothing and decided that this atmosphere was more to Joseph'staste than grandeur , and for some reason he was more alarmed than before . Ascetics were not as easily moved as grandiloquent men ; they tended to fanaticism and were often less than human in their emotions . Too , they frequently lacked conscience , could not be bribed easily , and , if they had humor it was usually wry and acrid , and without pity . Yet when Joseph turned to him with a formal greeting and an expression of gratitude that the senator had kindly vouchsafed to accept his invitation , Senator Bassett saw something in his fleshless face that touched him . Here was a man who had known infinite pain and sorrowand cruelty and rejection , and as the senator had suffered these himself he recognized them . He also remembered that a French poet had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stone . " Joseph'shad probably turned to stone , and now the senator felt oppressed and despondent . There was nothing so relentless as a man who had endured all the evil that the world can inflict , and who had turned against that world . " I have ordered ham and a bird for you , Senator , " said Joseph , " and beer and plum pudding . I hope it is all to your taste . " " You are very kind , " said the senator with new surprise . " They are my favorite victuals . " He was about to ask how Joseph knew that , and then he remembered , with a fresh rise of alarm , that Joseph had probablylearned a great deal about him and such minute inspection was not flattering and could be dangerous . It had also had a purpose . The senator well understood that Joseph was here to try to persuadep374him to retract on his support of the Alien Contract Labor bill , for the withdrawal of such support would endanger its passage . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal tone he had used since the senator had arrived . " I , myself , eat sparingly , and this heat ruins any appetite at all . I wonder why you senators remain here in the summer , and especially as a holiday is almost at hand . " " We have work to do , very pressing work , " said the senator . He sat down at the laid round table with its clean but cheap linen and tarnished silver . " I do n't like Washington , myself , but I am here to serve my country . " The old and pompous words sounded , in the senator 's strong yet musical voice , not hypocritical but sincere . " Against its enemies internal and external . " Joseph could study a man without giving any indication of such acute study and he soon knew that the senator was a man of absolute rectitude and not a political liar , and therefore he was out of place in this city and an anomaly . He also knew that the senator knew why he was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his power alone but for his own judgment of Joseph 's formidable weapons . Joseph 's hidden scrutiny scanned the senator 's face , lingered on the mouth and the large soft eyes of a deep liquid black and on the determinedly curly hair and mustache which were , in this heat , rebellingagainst oil and wax . He felt the faintest qualm , something he had not felt for years , and he crushed it . He had nothing against the senator personally . He knew that this man had been very poor , almost as poor as himself , and that what he had  --  mortgaged though it was  --  had been bought with earned money and not through loot and bribes . Joseph 's own dinner consisted of a dish of thin broth and a slice of cold meat and bread , and tea . He ate absently . The senator , though becoming more wary every moment , ate with heartiness and commented on his colleagues with kind amusement and did not name them . He was witty . When he laughed his laugh was higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of a cry at the end . The beer refreshedhim and he drank it copiously . " I heard , " said Joseph , " that you are really a farmer . I , myself , was born in the country . In Ireland . " " Ah , we have a number of congressmen who are Irish , " said the senator . " Yes , I am a farmer , born on a farm . I own four hundred acres of land in Massachusetts and another five hundred in New York State . Four tenant farmers . Now , " he added , with a sparkle of those unusually fine black eyes , " when I say I own ' those acres I mean I have title to them but the banks really own them . I am paying them off , with highp375interest . I was born in Massachusetts , but my wife was born in Georgia . I met her here in Washington when I was a congressman , and her father a senator . He felt she was stooping pretty low to marry me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued with pride , " a very pretty daughter who is marrying into a fine family in Boston . A very fine family . In September . " It suddenly occurred to Joseph that the senator 's artless recital was very like the very young Harry Zeff 's recital on the platform of the depot in Wheatfield so long ago . Again that sick qualm came to him , and again he crushed it down . " So your wife is a Southern belle , " said Joseph , with an attempt at jocosity . The senator laid down his fork and looked at him . " Yes , " he said . " A beautiful lady still . " His heart had begun a curious sharp beating . His judgment of men was very astute and he knew that such men as JosephArmagh are not given to jocoseness or pleasantries . Yet Joseph 's face was unreadable . He had hardly touched his meal . The senator said , and he was somewhat breathless , " I know you are here on business , Mr. Armagh . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator , " said Joseph , with much courtesy , " but you indeed can help me . I am a direct man . You probably know that I am here to discuss the Alien Contract Labor bill which you instigated and are now trying to push through the Senate . And I know that you have a number of your colleagues with you , for they highly respect you and would oblige you , even if they have , perhaps , some reservations about that bill . " The senator said , " Yes , they had reservations in the beginning . They do not have them now . They will vote with me out of conviction and not out of personal respect or friendship for me . I would not have it otherwise . " " Spoken like a man of integrity , " said Joseph . " I prefer to deal with honest men  --  who are usually reasonable into the bargain . " The senator struck a lucifer on the sole of his shoe and lit his cigar with hands that visibly trembled . " Mr. Armagh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arguments against that bill . I have considered them all . This is not a whim on my part , an emotional excitement . I have studied foreign contract labor for a long time , and have been outraged at the treatment accorded those poor creatures who , because they are forced to accept abominably low wages , keep American labor out of work . Did you know that some of your  --  friends  --  hired Chinese laborers to work on the railroads for twenty-four dollars a month , and then charged them forp376clothing and boots so that they had nothing left to feed or shelter themselves , except for barely enough to keep them alive ? And a kennel in which to sleep ? We have Hungarians , Bulgarians , Austrians , Poles , Germans , and God knows what else constantly being imported to replacewhat is alleged to be high cost American labor , ' and to subdue the struggling unions , and these poor souls hardly fare better than the unfortunate Chinese , who died to the man . " There is no use to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that these desperate men , and their families , are better off in America than in their own countries . They know it is a lie . Those men are lured here with promises which are never fulfilled , of course . We treat mongrel dogs better than these , Mr. Armagh , and I am sure that you know it . We have ostensibly outlawed slavery for black men . We now have slavery for white men . At least most of the owners of black men regarded them as valuable property , and fed and clothed and sheltered them with some adequacy , and had physicians for them . But these white slaves do not have these . Ah ! " exclaimed the senator with passion , " I do not know how those friends of yours can sleep of a night , Mr. Armagh , or how they can compose their immortal souls when they die ! " Joseph stared at him and smiled grimly . " I have never known anyone'ssleep to be disturbed , Senator , or their immortal souls either , if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spoken of the wretchedness of the foreign labor we have brought here . At least these people have their passage paid . " His hollow face had begun to darken and the senator watched him . " They had not had to watch their countrymen die in ditches from hunger , or their families . There was always some bread , some cheese , some cabbage , some shelter , no matter how sparse , no matter how poor . They never knew real Famine . I , Senator , did . I arrived here as a lad of thirteen with a young brother and a newborn sister to care for , and for what I receivedI paid for , with my own earnings . I had no job to go to , no shelter prepared . I was not a man . I was a child . And I was turned away from your free ports , Senator , until by some compassionate interventionI was allowed to enter , with my family . " I have worked all my life , at any work I could find to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . I starved , Senator , starved more painfully than do your foreign labor , for which you have so much pity . And I never grumbled . There were no senators to succor me , to plead the cause of the desperate and starving Irish who wanted to come here just to work . We were despised and rejected , everywhere we went.  |p377We  were refused work , until we had to lie and say we were not Irish , not Romans . ' No one cared that we suffered the consumption in this brave free land of yours , Senator , and died in our own blood , and wanted for bread and clothing . We were not permitted to work ! We were not permitted to live . Yet , somehow we lived . Somehow tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of us , fought our way out of the trap of our existence with our own hands and brains and courage . We asked no quarter ; we were given none . " Now , Senator , were we more fortunate in the beginning than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , thought the senator with a great inner bond of understanding and compassion . He will take revenge on the world that did that to him . " This world killed my parents , " said Joseph . " They were murdered just as surely as if they had been shot . Well , it is not important , is it ? The fact remains that alien contract labor , brought here on free passage  --  aswe were not  --  has the same opportunities , or lack of them , which I had . Most of them are men , but I was a child . You will say they have families with them . So did I. Let them do as I did . Let them work as I did . They are not feebler than I was . Eventually , if they are determined , they will break free  --  as I did . " The senator said , in the gentlest voice , " In other words , you want them to suffer as you did . Knowing the bitterness of hunger and exploitation  --  youwould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are they better than I ? " He made an abrupt gesture . " But I am afraid that we are digressing . Foreign labor is necessary for the expansion of America , so we must have it . " " I agree , " said the senator . " But let us pay them decent wages and give them a decent opportunity . Let us help the unions to succeed in demanding adequate money for our American labor , too . The whole point is that foreign labor , willing to work for almost nothing , is deprivingAmerican labor of work and starving it to death . Do I need to remind you of the railroad strikes and the murder of the strikers , and even of their wives ? If that is necessary for the expansion of America ' then I say  --  let us not expand ! " " It is said , " Joseph remarked , " that you can not bake bread without killing the yeast . " The senator pushed his'chair from the table with a gesture of despair . " I love epigrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful . We are talking of men , Mr. Armagh , not of yeast . Until more labor isp378needed we must not have foreign labor brought here in cattle boats . When it is needed , they must be paid a decent wage . " He added , " You speak of prejudice , Mr , Armagh , against the Irish . There is prejudice against these poor people also . Because they are what they are they are treated as less than human by our own citizens . That , too , must be rectified . There is no room among honorable men for prejudiceagainst other men for the fault  --  if you want to call it that  --  of their birth . Prejudice would be laughable if it were not so heinous , so evil . You , above all , should understand that . " But Joseph said , " We are not men who ask without rewarding . I suppose you know that ? " The senator had become pale , and now all the kind humor had left his face . He said , " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If my colleaguesshowed any signs of shame they could be forgiven , perhaps , for human failings and human greed . But they are not ashamed . They will vote against the best interests of their country  --  for money  --  and smugly swagger over it , and look for more . They are hired whores , Mr. Armagh . They are worse than whores . " Joseph could not help smiling . " But , like whores , they receive their pay . Come now , Senator . We are not offering bribes or anything so vulgaras that . We should be just grateful to buy what you could offer , for an excellent price . " " To withdraw my support from the Alien Contract Labor bill  --  which I instigated  --  and take my colleagues with me ? " " Exactly . It is a small matter . " " The answer , of course , is no , sir . " " There is no argument that can persuade you even to consider the matter ? " " No . I have heard all the arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am truly astonished that your friends should try again , for they have approached me before . " he stared intensely at Joseph . " Do you not know that what you have said , what you have offered , is a criminal offense against the dignity of the Senate , that you have attempted to bribe me and so have opened yourself to prosecution ? " " I know that , Senator . But you have no proof . " " And besides , " said the senator with immense bitterness , " it would only amuse some number of my colleagues , honorable men all ! " He added , " But I have hope that this bill will pass . The President is with me . We have a seemingly quiet and amiable Chief Executive , but he is a man of principle and has plans which he has confided but to a few , and I am proud that I am one of them . "  | " I have heard of President Garfield 's convictions , " said Joseph . " I think he is ill-advised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiated the raw and burning sunlight . Dust swirled on the windowsills in little dust devils . The sound of the traffic was louder in this room as the two men regarded each other in a pregnant silence . Then the senator said , " What do your people want ? " Joseph smiled his tight and bitter smile . " What does any man , in his heart , really want ? Power . Hypocrites scream ideologies and slogans to gain it over the gullible and what I like to call the pure-in-hearts . ' But my  --  friends  --  have no ideologies though they will solemnly use those of others if it serves them . They are men of many interests , politicians , merchant chiefs , mineowners , industrialists , bankers , railroaders , oilmen , shipbuilders and owners , munitions makers , men of inherited wealth , men of illustrious family both here and abroad , princes , if you will . Landowners . They have several things in common : None is devoted to his particular country . None cares about the people 's welfare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public to comprehend . All are sublime egotists . All are enemies of what you would call freedom , Senator . They want to rule , each in his own sphere , cooperating with the others . They want to be the Elite , with absoluteauthority over the lives and deaths and destinies of the world . At heart , they are all Robespierres , Dantons , Mirabeaus . Jacobins . " The senator stared at him fixedly , for he had heard the irony and contempt under Joseph 's words . He thought for a few moments and then said , " Jacobins . Yes . Revolutions never rise from the working people , the farmers , the petty shopkeepers . They rise from the bored and overfed bourgeoisie , the men who already rule , the so-called intellectuals , the affluent restless whose souls are empty of any spiritual value but lust for cold violence . In all history no despot ever rose from what is called the people . ' Despots rise from the depraved radicals , who hate their fellowman though they soothe him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see , Mr. Armagh , I know my history , too . " Then , " said Joseph , " you also know , as the Renaissance Italians knew , that politics and moral ethics never mix . Politics and ethics are a contradiction in terms . An honest politician is either a hypocrite  --  or he is doomed . " The senator stood up . He reached to a chair and picked up his tall silk black hat . He held it in his hands and studied it , and his expression was both grave and suffering . He said , almost inaudibly , " I still havep380hope that my countrymen will elect good men and not thieves and liars and exigent rascals and soft flatterers and potential looters . " He looked at Joseph . " I think I have said all that needs to be said . I will not abandon my position . I can not , in conscience . " Joseph stood up also . Now he held a sheaf of papers in his hand . " Then , Senator , I trust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please read them . " The senator took the papers . He began to read them , still standing . His face slowly grayed , became ghastly , though no feature moved . But drops of sweat appeared on his forehead and rolled down his cheeks like tears . Joseph watched him . Finally he could watch him no longer and he went to a window with a taste like dead dust in his mouth . He clenched his hands on the gritty sills and stared down sightlessly at the traffic . The silence behind him became weighted , as if inhabited by a corpse . He at last heard a rustling and knew that the papers had been replaced on the table . Still , he could not turn . The senator said in a dry whisper , " Who knows of this besides you ? " " Only one other , Senator . In full . The information was gathered separately by a dozen trained men who have no interest in you , and do not know the whole story . I have not shown these papers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " " What do you intend to do with that information , Mr. Armagh ? " Joseph slowly turned from the windows . His eyes felt scorched . He saw that the senator appeared to have dwindled , shrunk , and that he had the aspect of a man already dead . " Senator , " said Joseph , " if you do not withdraw your influence from the Alien Contract Labor bill I intend to give that information to the newspapers  --  and to several of your colleagues . I am sorry . You know there is no libel involved . You know the facts in these papers are true . " The senator fumbled for the chair he had left and now he fell in it . His head drooped . He said , hardly above a whisper , " We are in new days . It is no longer heinous  --  or repulsive  --  to have had a mulatto grandmother , who was a slave in South Carolina . She was a gracious lady , and was educated by her mistress , and tutors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had freed her . At last her mistress gave her a large sum of money and helped her to come North , to Canada . But , you know all that . She married a Canadian farmer of some substance  --  it is related here , why do I repeat it ? They moved to Massachusetts . I knew her well . She was until her death the dearest thing in my life . " He looked up at Joseph now with eyes wide and haggard . " Shep381taught me that nothing is so important as liberty , and that even liberty is not valuable unless it is accompanied by honor and responsibility . She taught me that no man worthy of the name can call himself a man unless he has integrity . " Joseph looked aside . " Then it does not matter if the news comes out that you had a grandmother of so many virtues , does it ? " The senator said , " We have quite a number of Negro congressmen in Washington these days , Mr. Armagh . No one despises them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator had not heard his remark . He said , " But your wife , the lovely Southern belle from Georgia  --  she does not know , does she ? And your daughter , who is to marry the Boston scion of a fine family  --  Mr. Gray Arbuthnot , is n't it ?  --  he does not know ? Perhaps they will not be so broad-minded as your senatorial colleagues , Senator , and I am afraid that they , too , will suddenly lose their tolerance , and not support you . I have noticed that tolerance ' has a way of vanishing when a man 's own future is at stake if he pursuesit . There is something else , also . Your enemies will conclude that your passion for the welfare of the American workingman , and your opposition to the importation of foreign labor , rises from the fact that you are the descendant of a slave , and so have a slave 's sensitivity to the enslavement ' of others . Do not think men are kind , Senator . They are devils . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eyes shimmered as if with tears . " My colleagues , in the Senate , are conservative Democrats and the more moderate of Republicans . They will not turn from me . " " They will . When did a man ever support anyone held up to public aversion or ridicule , no matter how innocent or good ? None , to my knowledge . Each of your friends will think of his own political future . He will not jeopardize it for you , my dear sir . Certainly , we all palpitatein the North now about the rise of the Negro . ' It is fashionable . But it is abstract . Coming down to facts is quite another thing , as the liberals well know , and the Whigs . Many of your conservative Democraticfriends are from the South , you will recall , and so are your more moderate ' Republicans . Publicly , they will utter soft words , but in reality they will run from you . " He added , " And what will your wife think ? How will she endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl descendedfrom a Negro slave ? Think on it , Senator . For , it is stated here , your wife does not know your history , nor your daughter . "  |p382The  senator 's head fell on his chest . He said in a broken voice , " You have said it . Men are devils . " " True , Senator . You have only to tell your colleagues that on further reflection you are not supporting the Alien Contract Labor bill any longer , and all this information will be destroyed . No one will ever know . I give you my word of honor . " The senator gave a groan of anguished laughter . " I have only to abandon my principles , desert my convictions , give up all that makes life endurable to a man ! " " Think of it as protecting your wife and your daughter , Senator . " The senator , a very sensitive and subtle man , heard something strange in Joseph 's voice , and he looked up quickly . " Ah , so you gave up much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others you loved ? " For an instant  --  so fleeting that the senator thought he had not seen correctly  --  Joseph 's face was formidable . But Joseph 's voice was reasonable and easy when he spoke . " Perhaps , Senator . I can tell you this : No one is worth a man 's life , a man 's sacrifice . " The senator stood up . He looked down at the papers . He wet his gray lips with the tip of his tongue . After several long moments he said , " It is possible that you are right , sir . I am coming to the conclusion that this world is really hell . " He put his hat above a face that had shriveled and become old and sunken . " I will think on all this , " he said . " You have to six o'clock tomorrow night , Senator . Send me word . If I do not hear from you  --  " The senator nodded . An unfathomable look of resolution filled his eyes . " I have until tomorrow night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw  --  ordo not withdraw . Yes . You will hear from me . " He turned towards the door , and his step was slow and feeble . Josephwent quickly to the door and opened it . The senator stood on the threshold . He turned his head with what appeared to be a heavy effort and looked Joseph in the face . " Mr. Armagh , " he said , " may God have mercy on you , for you are not a bad man . No , you are not a bad man . So , it is all the worse for you . " Joseph 's eyelids almost covered his small blue eyes . " I am what this world made of me , Senator . But is that not true of everyone ? " " No , " said the senator . " No . That is not true . We have our choices . " Joseph watched him walk uncertainly , as if drunk , down the long , hot and narrow hall with its shut doors and smells . Then the senator , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph shut the door.  |p383He  stood for a long time in the middle of his dusty blowing room . He looked at the fragments of the dinner he had eaten with the senator , at the dirty dishes and the soiled glasses . His eye touched the empty hearth . Suddenly he shivered , as if cold . He took the sheaf of papers and dropped them into the fireplace . He knelt and struck a lucifer . He set fire to the papers . They were thick and resistant . He lit more lucifers . The room filled with a smell of smoke and sulphur . The papers caught more freely . Now they burned as if with jubilation , and pieces of black paper flew up the chimney . Those in the fireplace curled into long black worms , then disintegrated . Joseph took a poker and demolishedwhat was left . As always , he had not been able to resist innocence . He sat on his narrow heels and said to himself , You are a fool , of course . You do n't even know why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man to me ? One politician more or less . I acted in my own worst interests . How am I going to explain this thing to my associates ? I dare not tell them what I 've done . They 'd laugh me out of existence , and then move to destroy me . This is a fine situation ! He looked at the black ashes and all at once something tight in him loosened . No one knew he had had this information except Timothy Dineen , who had gathered the reports of other investigators and had drawn them into one concise report . Joseph had only told his colleagues that he had " some information which might persuade Senator Bassett . I can try , at the very least . I think he will listen to reason . " He would have to tell them that the senator , at the last , had not listened to reason at all . Joseph shrugged . The rest lay with their new plots , which he doubted would be efficacious with a man like the senator . He already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not withdraw , for then he could not live with himself . Joseph stood up , restlessly . There was no train out of Washington tonight , or he would have left . He would have to stay in this abominable white and corrupt city , full of stenches and evil , until tomorrow , Joseph went to a Brahms concert that night but the music could not distract him as usual . He saw Senator Bassett 's face everywhere in the orchestra seats and in the boxes . Once he thought , If I knew where he lived I 'd go to see him tonight and tell him  --  Tell him what ? Of the destruction of the " information " ? Would that console a man so wounded now ? Would he be reassured that no other enemy would unearth the story sometime in the future ? Could he live with that knowledge , the fear , the haunting dread ? He did not fear for himself.  |p384He  had the most appalling fear of all  --  that the truth would destroy those he loved . Love , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a delusion , a crippling and a betrayal . No wonder it was so celebrated : It was so rare , so beyond the nature of man that it struck him into marveling as would a miracle . Only those were safe who never loved and did not love . They were safe from the world of men . He walked back to his hotel in the midnight heat of the city . The bricked or cobbled or muddy streets were crowded with vehicles , loud with laughter and the steel rattle of wheels and the clomping of horses ' hoofs . He saw the faces of politicians , rotund , flushed , jovial  --  he had met them often and knew them . They waved at friends from rich victoriasand coaches , and smiled and smiled and smiled . They never stop working , thought Joseph . They are sleepless predators . The fetid tropical heat did not lessen . It was worse in Joseph 's rooms . He tossed and dozed and had nightmares . Once he dreamt that he was on a little skiff and he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . But when he reached for it it sank again , and he heard a moaning . He awoke , sweating , just as the blue-green light of the predawnappeared . Then he got up and washed . When he was listlessly eating a meager breakfast a messenger arrived at his door with a letter . He opened it and saw it was from SenatorBassett . For a moment or two he squeezed his dry and scalded eyes together before he read . Then he stiffened . The senator had written : You have asked me to withdraw at the price of not destroying those who are dearest to me . There is but one way I can withdraw that will not lacerate my conscience so that I can not rest in peace . When you have received this I will have gone the way of all flesh . But with my dying breath I can only say this to you : I have laid a curse on you and none of those you cherish will ever prosper or fulfil your dreams and your hopes . It was not signed beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought he was smothering . There was an enormous chill all through his body , and an awful sickening . Everythingbecame cloudy about him . The walls and the ceilings of the room became mist , ruffling and flowing , dissolving . He felt faint . He had to reach for a chair , and he fell into it , the paper falling from his hands . He put his hands over his face and shuddered . It was not the dreadful curse of the self-immolated man which disturbedhim , for he was not superstitious . He believed neither in curses nor in blessings . It was something else . He had killed a phenomenon :  |p385an  honest man . After a long while he thought , But then , an honest man is ludicrous . He has no place in this world , and never had such a place . In a way , if all honest men died this would be a peaceful world , for there would be no transient disturbances and agitations , no foolish hopes , no dedicated and fruitless efforts doomed from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence . He was in the railroad station among the seething throngs when President Garfield was shot , not thirty feet from him . A few months later the Alien Contract Labor bill was passed by both the Senate and the House . " We owe this , " said one senator , " to the labors of our beloved Senator Enfield Bassett , who gave all his selfless energies to the passing of this bill . He died as an overladen horse dies , harnessed and pulling with all his strength , and it was an honorable death . The burdens of Public Office often kill . We consider Senator Bassett as much a martyr to his country 's weal as President Garfield who died on September 19th , after a desperate fight for his life over many weeks . " Joseph Armagh did not believe political assassinations were " random things , brewed up from insane minds and disordered intellects , " as some newspapers averred concerning President Garfield . The hand on the trigger might have been " random , " and the mind and intellect " insaneand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not randomor insane or disordered . They knew why and what they did . Joseph Armagh said to his son , Rory : " You are not doing exceptionallywell in mathematics , at your school . But I notice that you excel in history and English and German and French , Latin and literature . " He smiled at the boy . " So , I am pleased with you . However , you will have to be more proficient in mathematics to get into Harvard . " He laughed . " For an intellectual you are singularly healthy and sane and pragmatic . " " I know enough about mathematics to think I should get an increase in my allowance , " said Rory with his beguiling and impudent smile . " I get only two dollars more than does Kevin . " " A dollar is a dollar , and it is a lot of money . Three dollars a weekfor a lad of fifteen is sufficient . Kevin buys his own pets out of his onedollar a week , and is very serious for a spalpeen only nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved lithely and quickly , with hisp386grandfather , Daniel Armagh 's , grace but with his father 's strength and economy of movement . He was exceedingly handsome , with a buoyant and energetic air , which he had inherited from his mother . He was also courtly and gallant , even at his young age , and was always ready with a pungent joke . He had Joseph 's once-russet hair , but his curled , endearingly  --  to the ladies and young girls  --  over his forehead , about his ears and almost down to his nape . But the russet was brighter than Joseph 's had ever been , with a more pronounced reddish tinge , and was vital and coarse . He had a big well-shaped nose with a slight tilt at the tip , and a smiling mouth , also well-shaped , and large white teeth . His eyes , under red-gold brows , were light blue and mocking and usually mirthful , though frequently touched with good-humored cynicism . Like Joseph 's , his cheekbones were broad , his chin determined . He gave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life , and exceptional intelligence . His pink lower lip had a sensual thicknessto it . He was also exigent , in a charming and coaxing way , though he could also be brutal when necessary . He appeared more mature than his age . Unlike other very handsome youths he was always curious , always searching for new knowledge , new insights , and he found humanityuproariously funny . Except for his father . He knew , even at fifteen , almost all there was to know about Joseph and had acquired his knowledge in many avid and devious ways and from scores of other men and from the newspapers , and from his mother , and he found his father endlessly fascinating . Joseph was the only creature Rory feared , and perhaps loved . Young as he was , he was not a virgin , nor had been since he was fourteen . Girls , and even older women , were as attracted to him as he was attracted to them , and even from his earliest youth he was gayly licentious and did not care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unlike Joseph he loved danger and the excitement of it . He would be , many said with conviction , an extraordinary man , not only because of his appearance and his ability to fascinate men as well as women , but because of his intellectual qualities , his eloquent and manly speaking voice , and his flair for smiling sarcasm . He was already a politician in the small world he still occupied . Though he was sometimes suspected by his school fellows to be " bookish , " he led them . He rode a horse like a centaur , played tennis magnificently , and could climb like a monkey , for he was fearless . At times he was even rowdy . His twin sister , Ann Marie , did not resemble him in the slightest . She was a slender , rather thin , and quiet girl , somewhat tall and ofp387so flat a figure that her mother constantly wailed over it . Once as noisy as her brother , she was now inclined to silence , probably , Joseph thought , because her mother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light brown hair , which she dressed simply as befitting a schoolgirl of fifteen , an oval face with a clear pale complexion , large sherry-brown eyes , a small nose and a controlled mouth resembling her father 's . Her mother had convinced her , when she had been still very young , that she possessed no beauty but was " very plain , " so the girl wore clothes without distinction and which were often drab . But Joseph , once becoming aware of her , saw that she had the austere eleganceso much admired by the Irish , and it startled him , for his children were fourteen years old before he was actually conscious of their being and their identities . For , to him , Rory and Ann Marie had been " Bernadette 's children , " or the grandchildren of the loathed Tom Hennessey . As such he had little interest in them and less affection , beyond an indulgent vague fondness when he saw them playing or listened to their arguments . He had often forgotten their existence , and sometimes , hearing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paid their bills at preparatory ( boarding ) schools in Boston and Philadelphia , but as Timothy Dineen wrote out the cheques for all expenses and Joseph merely signed them , he was hardly aware even of this . To JosephArmagh , his " family " had meant his parents , and then his brother and sister . Bernadette 's " family " was something else again and not part of himself as Sean and Regina had been . On more than one occasion , when someone queried about the welfare of his family , he had absently but sincerely seemed surprised and had replied , " I have no family . " He finally discovered that others looked at him , then , in a sidelong and speculative fashion , which was more than a little unpleasant , and so he was careful now in his answers and , while he never demonstrated enthusiasm , he would say , " My family is well , thank you , " and change the subject impatiently . He never visited his children at their schools , nor had he shown any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in Green Hills it would sometimes be months before he saw his children . He did see them at Christmas and Easter , and found their presence boring and avoided them . It was as if his profound devotion to his brother and sister , his total engrossment with them , had depleted the vital reserves of love in himself and had drained him dusty . There was nothing left to give to others , and since Sean and Regina had " deserted " him hep388was more than ever detached from other human beings , and absolutely indifferent . The spring of his affections was filled with stones . Bernadette 's adoration and love for him had become fanatically obsessivesince she had learned that he cared nothing for her and had married her only at her dying mother 's deluded request . She had her father 's tenacity of purpose : she would win Joseph 's love no matter how long it would take , and she dedicated herself to his interest and his well-being and served him with a slavishness that everyone knew , and even pitied , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knew that Bernadette was no longer insistent with him or demanding . He was not grateful for this blessing , nor did he care . The less he saw of his wife the more contented he was . He appreciated her as a fine housekeeper and an excellent hostess , and that was all he desired of her . He had not approached her sexually since his younger son , Kevin , had been born . He had not wanted another child ; he held Bernadetteto blame for Kevin , and so he had avoided her since that time . He was not cruel nor harsh with her . She simply was absent from his mind , and when he was away from Green Hills he never thought of her at all . Had she died he would have felt no regret . He rarely conversedwith her , and since Kevin 's birth she could no longer amuse him or make him give his grudging laugh . Sometimes he appeared startled , as if wondering who she was , when she entered a room . Bernadette , though not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninterest in her . She had the romantic notion that selfless and passionate love would eventually reach him , and as she was optimisticby nature she was infrequently discouraged . On those rare occasionsshe would ask herself in despair : What do I see in him ? Why do I love him with all my heart and soul ? He is not handsome in the accepted fashion . His voice is cold and short . He is not suave nor considerate . He shows me no tenderness . He looks at me blankly . Yet , how I love him , how I adore him ! I would die for him . The mystery of love never occurred to her , and so she suffered deeply and intensely because her love was not requited . However , she never gave up hope . There was much that was superficial in her and so she did not know that it was sufficient for love to serve , however despised or unnoticed . But Joseph 's mere presence in her house was enough to give her a piteous joy . When he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she was ecstatic . Her adoration surrounded him like a bubble . His indifference to her children did not disturb her as once it had done in a faint fashion . The fewer those whom Joseph cared about the more she was pleased . She was jealous of Timothy Dineen , and wasp389elated when James Spaulding died and Timothy had been dispatched to take his place in Titusville and in Joseph 's interests in the northwest section of the Commonwealth and in Ohio and in Chicago . ( There were eight lawyers working under Timothy in Titusville , and a very large office force . ) Joseph had a new and handsome secretary , one Charles Devereaux , a brilliant lawyer , a man of his own age who , Bernadette dimly knew , was from " somewhere in Virginia . " Charles had enormous responsibilities , of which Bernadette did not even try to guess . She was passionately jealous of him , for he accompanied Joseph everywhere and lived in this house when Joseph was in Green Hills , and there seemed , to Bernadette , too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when Charles was present that Joseph really laughed or exhibited the slightest animation . Sometimes she complained petulantly to Joseph about this , saying that he preferred the company of his secretary-associate to the presence of his wife and children , but Joseph never answered , and so Bernadette came to hate Charles . His exceptional and almost beautiful appearance would have attracted her under other circumstances , but now she thought of him as an enemy who had " stolen " affection rightfully belonging to " the family . " As for Harry Zeff and his Liza , they never came to Green Hills . Bernadette had made it very obvious that she despised the presence of " that Arab " and " his servant girl , " and found them offensive and an insult to herself . " One of these days , " she said significantly to Joseph , nodding her head wisely as if she had secret information , " that Harry will betray you . But you never listen to me . " It gave her enormous satisfaction when her children were old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals were eliminated . She would effusively declare her love for them , and how she missed them , to sympathetic friends , but she was happy they were gone and was even happier when they visited friends during the summer holidays . In short , if she could have imprisoned Joseph in the great white mansion in Green Hills she would have been overjoyed , and would have been content not to have seen anyone else herself , for all her gregarious disposition . She had made herself so cutting and vicious to Elizabeth Hennessey that Elizabeth had bought the house that Joseph had built for his family and had removed herself and her son . Sometimes Bernadette wondered why Elizabeth remained in Green Hills at all . Of course , Joseph " managed " Mrs. Hennessey 's affairs , as a kindness to the widow whose husband he had destroyed , Bernadette conceded . But he could have done that as well if she had gone back to her native Philadelphia.  |p390Elizabeth  was rarely invited to the Hennessey house except at Christmasand on New Year 's Day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston as did Rory . Bernadette did not see her half brother more than once a year and had no interest in him . He was , in her opinion , a " poor thing " contrasted with the resplendent Rory . Bernadette had lost the charm of youth , and was now a very plump matron heavily encased in restraining whalebone , with a large bosom and larger hips , but always extremely fashionable and overdressed . Never very pretty , her round flattish face had acquired a double chin and her original golden tint of complexion had become engorged . She had nothing left now but her fine and sparkling hazel eyes . She wore her thin brown hair , which was modishly cut short in the latest fashion , elaborately and painfully curled all over her blunt head . She also dipped into the paint pots and not always discreetly . But her vivacity and energy , if sometimes a little forced now , still pleased her many friends if her growing overbearing manner and autocratic and maliciousjudgments did not . She was the leader of society in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinguished and dangerous a husband , and was also feared in Philadelphia and other cities . Now , as she would contentedly and proudly assert , she could " mingle " at ease with the Belmonts , the Goulds , the Fisks , the Regans and Morgans and others in New York , and there was none who could belittle or snub her . Her jewels rivaled the jewels of any other woman . She favored Worth as her dressmaker , and her millinery was superb . When , once a year or so , she insisted on accompanying Joseph to Europe  --  her only insistence these days  --  she had a French maid with her and so many trunks and bags that an extra stateroom had to he engaged besides the one she occupiedand the one Joseph used . Joseph became reconciled to her presence . As always , she was a perfect hostess to his colleagues . Once she had said to Joseph , " No one now ever seems to care we are Irish . " She had said this with smugness and with a triumphant toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph had given her his fierce and concentrated look which lasted several minutes , and why she had felt so abashed and so bewildered . She had not detected the rage and contempt in his eyes , nor the hatred that had caused a blue fire under his brows . She only knew that in some fashion she had offended him , and so had fawned humbly upon him . He had not spoken to her for several days after that . Then when her children were fifteen years old she received the most wounding and most crushing experience of her life.  |p391In  1875 Joseph had visited Mr. Montrose  --  whom he now knew as Clair Devereaux  --  in Virginia . The beautiful new plantation house had impressed Joseph and so had the flourishing fields of cotton and the herds of cattle and the fine horses . " Without your help in the purchase of the adjoining property I 'd now be the usual bankrupt Southern plantation owner  --  thanks to Yankee carpetbaggers and sundry other scalawags , " Clair had said , shaking Joseph 's hand warmly and with deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear wife , Luane , whom I married in Pittsburgh two years ago . " Joseph thought that Luane Devereaux was one of the most beautiful women he had ever met . He saw her wonderful gray eyes , her masses of black hair , her full rosy mouth and her lovely body . He knew , now , the history of the Devereaux 's . Ostensibly , in Virginia , she was Clair 's concubine and servant . Later he met their son , Charles , who had been wounded in the war which had killed his grandfather . Joseph was astonished at his resemblance to his father , for he had Clair 's curling yellow hair and subtle face and height , though he had inherited his mother 's eyes . Charles , at that time , had been graduated from Harvard Law School and was practicing in Boston . He had married a Boston girl of good family . Charles had given Joseph a challenging look on the first meeting , but Joseph had ignored it and had thought Charles somewhat of a fool . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , and slowly Charles came to trust him and no longer challenged him with his cold gray eyes . Charles became very successful , and a partner in his firm in Boston . When Mr. Spaulding had died of old age and infirmities Joseph had offered Charles his place , at a very large salary . Charles had hesitated , and then had said to Joseph bluntly , " I assume my  --  history  --  wo n't be broadcast in Titusville ? " Joseph said , " Do n't be a damned idiot . I am not offering you this becauseI have had long association with your father , and admire him . I am offering it because I think you are competent . If I 've been mistaken I 'll boot you out without any ceremony at all . " Charles had understood that Joseph had deliberately misunderstood him . He also knew that his " history " was meaningless to Joseph , though he did not discount the fact that Joseph could be very dangerous indeed if necessary . So Charles , who had inherited his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Joseph , had accepted the offer . He had an impressive house in Titusville where he lived with his wife and consulted with Timothy Dineen , but he traveled with Joseph and was his " confidential legal adviser " and associate . He was a fanaticalp392Southerner and often amused Joseph with his derision for Northerners and " Yankee expediency . " He was exigent , himself , and lacked all scruples when it came to Joseph 's interests . In i 88o Clair and Luane Devereaux had died of the flux and Joseph had attended their funeral . He had said nothing when Clair had been buried in the Devereaux family plot and Luane had been buried among former slaves . But he saw Charles 's face . He said to Charles : " What does it matter where a man 's bones are buried ? My father 's grave is unknown . My mother 's bones lie in the sea . At least your mother has a resting place and a tombstone . Who is more fortunate , you or I ? " From that time on Charles gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , and said nothing in the years he served Joseph Armagh . Sometimes Joseph 's ambiguous probityamused him . He knew about Senator Bassett . He had helped to gather the information about the unfortunate man . Like his father , Charles was indifferent to the sources of income or how that income was obtained . Still , it wryly touched him that Joseph had destroyed all evidence against the senator . It was a never-ending source of cynical and inner hilarity to Joseph that Charles had a slight aversion for Harry Zeff , and sometimes , like Bernadette , referred to him as " the Arab , " though he truly admired Harry 's genius for organization and management , and learned from him and was politely deferential to him . To Joseph , the spectacle of humanitywas absurd and its pretensions laughable . When Harry said of Charles , with some admiration , " That 's a mean Southern bastard , " Harry did not understand why Joseph 's small eyes glittered with merriment . " You 'd think , " Harry said , " that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call himself human . Or claim to be an intelligent gentleman . " Joseph had replied , " If the history of every man in this world were known , back to our forefathers , none of us would have reason for any pride at all . " Harry had smiled and had not answered this . He knew too well the pride of Joseph Armagh , and so Harry had his own source of secret laughter . It was on one warm June day , brilliant with sun and suffused with the fragrance of roses , that Joseph became really aware of his children . He and Charles were in Green Hills for a few days . Joseph was at his desk in his rooms and Charles was standing by a window looking over the glistening green grass and the flowers and the long lawns and trees . He suddenly said , " They are fine young people . I wish I had childrenof my own . " Joseph had looked up impatiently . " What ? " he said.  | " Your children , " said Charles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and the girl is delicate and graceful . A lady . " Joseph stood up and went to the window and looked out . Anything that caught the attention of Charles Devereaux must be remarkable , for Charles , like himself , was usually uninterested in others and consideredfew worthy enough to deserve a remark . Rory and Ann Marie were walking side by side over the long lawns in the sun . There was a deep affection between them . They were holdinghands like very young lovers , and their heads were bent and they were evidently talking seriously . Rory 's reddish head was bright in the sunlight , and seemed haloed with color , and he walked like a dancer with poise and economy and ease . His handsome boy 's face was absorbed and attentive . He was somewhat of a dandy and wore the latestfashions , which became him . Ann Marie walked beside him , with a faintly timid air and lightness , her blue dress clinging to her slight but proud figure , her brown hair shining , her pale face gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly , and occasionally she nodded . For the first time Joseph was thoroughly and completely aware of them , and that they were his children , and that they were personable and human and had a poignant air of youth and identity . They were also beautiful and in some way moving . Joseph leaned on the marble windowsill and stared at his children and then said to himself , in reluctantand even angry wonder : My children ! Suddenly they were no longer Bernadette 's , but his own . They were not the grandchildren of Tom Hennessey , but the grandchildren of Daniel and Moira Armagh , and they had their blood and their flesh . I know nothing about them , thought Joseph , with renewed wonder though without regret . They were like a revelation to him , for they had destiny also . At some distance behind them Kevin ambled , his stocky child 's body , broad and strong , possessed of the awkwardness of childhood . He had a dark square face with hard facial bones , very resolute and grave . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep brown hair was a mass of curls . His dark brown eyes were examining something he held in his hands , and he was intent upon it . Joseph had never noticed it before : Kevin resembled Moira Armagh 's father , a sturdy and compact Irishman who would never compromise with anything , not even with his God , a quietly belligerent man of daunting pride and self-respect . Joseph , at the window today , did not know he was smiling as he looked down at his children . He did not know , until somewhat later ,  |p394that  love for them had come to him on that June day and that finally they were his own and part of himself , and that he had acquired anotherfamily . On Rory 's fifteenth birthday Joseph said to him , trying to smile , " I am going to make you President of the United States of America . " Rory looked at his father with impudent thoughtfulness and said , " You 'll try damned hard anyway , Pa . And I 'll try with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please him , and he had felt sharp pain and a sudden blank confusion . Rory asked , " Why should that be important to you , Pa ? " Joseph had considered , and Rory watched him and saw the darkeningof his face and the tightening of his mouth . Joseph said , " I could never explain it to you , I am afraid . I have too many memories . " Rory had nodded , as if he understood in entirety . For Ann Marie Joseph had acquired a special tenderness . She had a simplicity of character which both frightened and touched him . It was not Regina 's simplicity , which had been full of knowledge , but a limpid simplicity that knew nothing of evil and so denied it . For Kevin Joseph now had a rough and rollicking affection , and he sometimes called Kevin " you old man . I think you were born with a beard . " Rory acquired learning with ease and insouciance , but Kevin labored earnestlyand grubbily . When Joseph learned that his children had always loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulous . But , there it was . He had done nothing to gain their love , and yet they had given it to him as they had not given it to their mother who had indulged them and then had pettishly resented them because they had not lived up to the " new theories " she had acquired from reading HoraceMann 's effusions . They did not respond as Horace Mann had alleged children would respond to certain methods . It finally came to Bernadette that they thought their mother somewhat silly , and as Bernadette was not silly in the least she had been outraged . She had always been glad when they were absent , so she could think of no one but Joseph . A year after the day Joseph had secretly acknowledgedhis children as his own she had learned that he loved them . For that she never forgave them . Her jealousy crushed and almost demolishedher . It wounded her in her deepest places . Without an effort they had gained Joseph 's love , and she , who gave her life to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever given birth to them . They were her rivals , her enemies . To please Joseph shep395pretended solicitude and affection for them . They had stolen from her , she believed , what was rightfully hers . To Bernadette the most grievous day of her life occurred when she had complained to Joseph of Ann Marie 's " ugliness , " and had said , " I doubt the girl will ever make a good marriage , with her lack of beauty and presence . Dear me , she is not in the least charming . She has no style at all . " Joseph had turned on her with so vindictive a face and with such a savage look that she had recoiled . He said , " Let my children alone . I warn you , let my children alone . " Bernadette , abandoned , felt the first profound prostration she had ever experienced . She had been forced to take to her bed , she who was never ill . For days she lay in her darkened room , unable to weep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not even speak . She felt that she was dying , and actually longed for death . When she recovered a little she had aged . Her grief was more endurablebut heavy with sorrow . However , she had courage . It is just a matter of time , she would tell herself . They will soon be married and gone , and I will be alone with Joseph , and he will finally know that he has no one but me . We are not getting younger . Some day he will understand and love me , and I can only wait for that . She knew , by now , his many infidelities . She knew of the woman he loved . But , she was his wife , and a wife 's position was impregnable , upheld by God and society and all legal sanctions . Even Joseph Armagh could not forever ignore these . Now there remained to her , in her clutching despair , only her husband and herself . One of his classmates said to Rory Armagh : " Your father is only an Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pious Puritan blackbirder , who baptised miserable savages and blessed them then spirited them into slavery , though it was against the law . Nothing like a few prayers on the way to the bank ! " " Hah ! " said the other youth . " At least my father does n't sleep with his mother-in-law . " Rory , the good-tempered and genial , had then almost beaten his opponentto death with a wild savagery he had never displayed before in all his vigorous life . He was immediately expelled , and returned top396Green Hills , and his father , in Philadelphia , received a formal letter from the schoolmaster : I regret to inform you , sir , that your son , Rory Daniel Armagh , has been expelled from this school because of a violent and unprovoked attackhe made on young Mr. Anthony Masters during recess on April 12 inst. , in the Yard . Mr. Masters had been confined to the infirmary with sundry lacerations and bruises and a broken arm and a Concussion , and his condition is serious . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several weeks . Mr. Burney Masters , of Boston , who is a revered and distinguished member of Boston Society , is much incensed over this brutal punishment inflicted on his son and is consideringlegal action . It is only due to my importunities and beseechings that he is delaying such action and has it under advisement with his lawyers , of the notable concern of McDermott , Lindsay , Horace and Witherspoon . I have the good repute of Our School to consider , and this dastardly attack will hardly enhance the Reputation of our Institution , and there will be Discussions among Parents which will rebound upon the School . This is sad because so many of our graduates have gone on to careers of distinction in Public Affairs and business , and never before has there been such an Incident . It is unfortunate that young Mr. Armagh has been expelled only two months prior to his graduation from the School , but he invoked this disastrouscontretemps and no one else . I regret that we can not recommendhim , as projected , to Harvard University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repute and learning , despite Mr. Armagh 's scholastic record which heretofore led all others . No one deploresthis Event more than do I , Your ob'ent Servant , Geoffrey L. D. Armstead . Joseph returned at once to Green Hills with Charles Devereaux in a cold fury both against his son and Mr. Armstead , who was no favorite of his . Joseph said , on the train , " That damned supercilious old bastard ! Prim-lipped Puritan and pecksniffer ! I had to pay twice the fee to get that damned Rory enrolled at that school , among the Genteel Scions of Boston and New York and Philadelphia , to quote Armstead , and now see what he does ! Ruins and disgraces himself , and humiliates me . " Charles said , " Let us hear Rory 's story from himself . I know of Armstead . He would appear at Harvard when I was there , at teas and such , with his wife , who is a mean little brown hen of a woman , though of such Noble Ancestry , as she would confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , I know that Rory is a favorite of yours , " said Joseph , withp397an angry glance at his secretary . " If he had murdered young Masters you 'd find some excuse for him . " He ran his lean fingers through his thick russet and white hair , and the implacable expression which everyonefeared settled on his face . " What can we do to ruin Armstead ? " Charles gave this long consideration . " He is not a businessman . Inheritedwealth , old family , sound investments , married into a rich family of the same caliber . No political background , and does n't mingle with politicians . Of course , there is always something , as we 've found out in the past . But that would take time , and Rory is only seven weeks away from graduation , so we must get to work at once to have him reinstated . The only thing we can do  --  if it is at all possible  --  is to put pressure on Mr. Burney Masters , the father , to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges , and get Rory reinstated at once . Armsteadcould never refuse Mr. Masters . Masters is an alumnus of that school and has a large scholarship running . " " Burney Masters , " said Joseph , frowning . " Did n't he run against the Irish Mayor of Boston and lose ? " Charles smiled . He took out his notebook and pencil . " So he did . And is n't the mayor a friend of yours ? Did n't you contribute to his campaign ? It seems , if I remember correctly , that Mr. Masters ran on a Reform Platform and said some unkind things about the Boston Irish during the campaign . Not that that will do us any good , however . It was a miracle that the present mayor was elected under the circumstances . The mayor is hardly one who can put pressure on Mr. Armstead , who despises him . I believe the feeling is mutual . " Charles leaned back in his comfortable chair in Joseph 's private coach and closed his clever gray eyes and thought for a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " in a deep and contented voice . " Mr. Armagh , I do believe there is something . You will remember that all odds were with Mr. Masters for his election over the present mayor . Mr. Masters conducted a strong and determined campaign , and is an eloquent speaker , and put a lot of money of his own into that campaign , and had the backing of all the Beacon Street el.egantes and gentry . The present mayor was too florid  --  and too Irish  --  to be very effective , except among his own , and his way of dancing a little jig and singing an Irish ballad or two on the platform did not enhance his reputeamong the Proper Bostonians , though his own enthusiastically applauded him . Mr. Masters not only led , according to the Boston newspapers , but his dignity and presence , as they called it , boded well for an administration which would not be soiled and corrupt as the pre/vious one was , but one of which Bostonians could be proud and vindicatedas citizens of an honorable city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened during the last three weeks of the campaign . Mr. Masters made fewer and fewer publicappearances . His speeches were weaker and more restrained , and less pejorative . He seemed to have lost steam . He made no appearance at all during the last week , and refused newspaper interviews except for one mild plea for his election . His posters disappeared . His people made no more house-to-house calls . There were no more bulletins on Major Issues . Now , that is very interesting . I wonder what happened to Mr. Masters ? " " I wondered at the time , myself , " said Joseph , sitting up and looking at Charles with interest . " I asked Old Syrup , as we called him , and he only smiled that peculiar Sphinx-like smile the Irish can assume when they have something under their nose ' which they prefer not to make public . So , he had something on Masters , something lethal . It must have been very good . Charles , send him a telegram in my name tonight and take a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wily character , " said Charles . " He wants to be governor , and he wo n't do anything , even for you , which will jeopardize that . " " But I know something very lethal , myself , about Old Syrup , " said Joseph , with great satisfaction . " If he wants to be governor he had betternot antagonize me . I think we have concluded the problem . In the meantime I will deal with Rory . " " With fairness and restraint , I hope , " said Charles . This time Joseph smiled a little . The two men were met by a wailing Bernadette who exclaimed at once , " Your son ! He has disgraced us forever ! And I was such friends with Emma Masters , who leads Boston society , and we were received almost everywhere in Boston ! The Armsteads were gracious to us , too , on more than one occasion , and were most civil . Now , we will be outcastsin Boston , humiliated and ignored and snubbed , all due to your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinedyoung gentleman like young Masters ! " Only Charles saw that she felt considerable secret elation over this episode , for she believed that Rory would no longer be so loved by his father , and therefore would no longer be her rival . Joseph glared at her and said , " Refined young gentlemen do not provoke attacks . I will be in my study . Send Rory to me at once . " " If you do not punish him severely you will be lacking in your Duty , Joe , " said Bernadette , a little dismayed at Joseph 's reception of her coin/plaint . " To think he would have been graduated from that distinguishedschool in June , with honors , and now he will not graduate , he will be accepted only in the lowest establishments and will not be admitted to Harvard , and he has ruined his future ! " " Send Rory to me , " said Joseph , and left her abruptly . Charles accompaniedhim . By the time they had reached Joseph 's rooms Joseph was again in an icy rage against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in Philadelphia . Joseph did not like intrigues for intrigue 's sake , and only indulged in them when absolutely necessary . Rory , immaculately dressed as always , and resplendently handsome in spite of an impressive black eye , came at once to the study . His high color was a little subdued . He wore a curious expression of reserve and tightness , like his father 's , but Charles had never seen this before on the lad 's face , usually so open and twinkling and mirthful . Joseph let him stand before him like a penitent . " So , " he said , " my son is a boisterous and murderous hooligan , is he ? Without any thought at all he tries to destroy his own future , which has already cost his father a pretty penny , sir . What have you to say for yourself ? " Rory said , and his cynical blue eyes were averted , " He insulted  --  you  --  Pa . " Charles stood behind Joseph 's chair , and he tried to catch the seventeen-year-old youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullennesson Rory 's usually merry mouth , and a secretiveness . " Now , " said Joseph , " that 's a very fine sentiment , I am thinking , protectingyour father 's honor . Look here , Rory , I have never concealed my activities from you . I have told you many times that businessmen are not concerned with legal or illegal activities , so long as they do n't engagethe attention  --  too keenly  --  of the law , and even then that can be surmounted . Business is business , as it has been said over and over . It has no particular ethics . It has only one standard : Will something succeedor not ? We are not the Salvation Army or Morality Troops . We deal with a hard and exigent world , and so have to be hard and exigent too , if we are not to be bankrupts . I 've told you this often , and I thought you understood . " He paused and looked at Rory . But Rory , with rare stubbornness , was staring at his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rebelliousas many youths appear when castigated by a father . He had the appearance of someone who is protecting something , or someone . However , only Charles noticed this , and not Joseph , who was growing coldly angry again . Rory said , " He called you  --  names . "  |p400Jose|ph  's thin mouth tightened even more . " Rory , I have been called every name you can imagine , and many more . Some I have deserved ; some I have not . It is of no importance to me and should not be of importance to you . I thought you understood that . You will be called names , too , in the future . If you are sensitive to name-calling then you had better settle for a clerkship in one of my offices , or teach in some obscure little school , or open a shop . Now , Rory , let us put this nonsenseaside . I will do what I can to get you reinstated . I think it is possible . " " My marks , " said Rory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I do n't need to return to that school . I excelled in all the curriculum . I did n't even have to take the last examination ; my record stood for itself . Old Armstead knows that . He is only being malicious , because he hates you , Pa , and me  --  because we are Irish . He 'd do anything to frustrate you . You will remember how he opposed my entry into his damned stupid school . " Now the boy flushed and he looked at his father with an anger equaling Joseph 's own . " I resent it that you had to pay double to get me enrolled there ! " " Who told you that ? " asked Joseph sharply . " Old Armstead , himself , with that spittle-satisfaction of his , four days ago . " Joseph and Charles exchanged a glance . " If I ca n't make my way with my own endowments in any damned school or college I do n't want it ! " exclaimed Rory , his face deepening in color . " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gentler when he spoke . " You have to face the facts of life , Rory , and I do n't like it that you are beginning to sound Noble . Endure humiliations , but bide your time for your revenge , and never forget . The day will always come when you can repay . I know . But once a man begins to feel Noble he is already defeated . If he wo n't fight , then he 'd better tuck his tail between his legs and slink away . That 's the law of life , and who are you to defy it ? " Charles said , " Every man has to endure belittlement for one thing or another , Rory . He has to make his compromises , though without weakness . If he can conceal something about himself which is injurious , then he should do so . If he has nothing really deadly to be ashamed of , but it is said that he has , then he should fight . " Rory was extremely fond of Charles , but now he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for you , Charles , but you are a Devereauxof Virginia and no one could ever unjustly point a finger at your parents , or yourself . "  |p401There  was a sudden long silence . Charles looked again at Joseph who shook his head peremptorily . But Charles drew a deep breath and said , " You are wrong , Rory . I am a Negro . " Rory flung up his head and gaped at Charles , his mouth opening . " What ! " he cried incredulously . Charles nodded , with a beautiful and amiable smile . " My mother was also a Devereaux , by blood , but she was born a slave , and she bore me , an illegitimate darkie , to my father . " Rory stared wide-eyed at Charles 's yellow hair , sharp features and gray eyes . He looked stunned . " Rory , " said Charles , " if someone asked me if I were a Negro I would say yes . I feel no disgrace , no inferiority . But it is my affair , my secret if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anyone else 's . Before , say  --  Divinity  --  there is no color , no race . There are only Men . But the world does n't know that , and so a man often has to protect himself from undeservedmalice and cruelty . He keeps any harmful secret to himself . " Joseph was moved as he had rarely been moved before . That the proud Charles Devereaux should risk telling a seventeen-year-old youth such a dangerous secret told Joseph more than anything else of Charles 's loyalty to him and his attachment to his family . Joseph was not a man for gestures , but he put his hand briefly on Charles 's arm . Rory was still staring at Charles , and now the stony hardness of his young and vital face softened . " By golly , " he said , almost in a whisper . He thought . Then he said , " I guess I 'm not the man you are , Charles . " However , the secretiveness had returned to his eyes , and Charles saw it . " I reckon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only call your father an Irish something-or-other , but said something else about him . " " Yes , " said Rory , after a long pause . " It ca n't be very important , " said Joseph , still touched . " What was it , Rory ? " Rory was silent . He was staring at his boots again and the heavy flush had come back to his face . " Well ? " demanded Joseph with impatience . " I ca n't tell you , Pa . " " Is it that disgraceful ? " Joseph was smiling again . " To me , it is , " said Rory . " My God , lad , do n't be a fool . You know what I am . I 've never pretended to be anything different from what I am . I never hide anything , though I do n't shout it to the skies . I 'm not concerned with people 's opinion of me , nor should you be . "  | " Suppose , Mr. Armagh , " Charles intervened , " that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll laugh at it . Every man is entitled to one little secret of his own , is n't that so , Rory ? " " Maybe Pa does n't want this to be known , or talked about , " said Rory and he looked at his father with such poignant love that Charles was shaken . But Joseph was curious and did not notice the emotion in his son 's eyes . " If young Masters knew it , then everybody knows it , " said Joseph . " But , it is a lie ! " Rory cried out . " A dirty lie ! I could n't let a lie like that pass , before the whole school ! " Something dangerous flickered between Joseph 's eyelashes . He considered his son . The truth did not occur to him . He had been most careful , most discreet , in one single area of his life , more completely secretive than ever before , and he did not think of that one area now for he believed that only he and one other knew about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning into a dainty milksop , Rory . Lies are told by the thousands about me . It does n't matter ; I do n't care . But what was this particular lie that so inflames you ? We can settle it betweenourselves . " A look of complete despair , but of increased stubbornness , fell over Rory 's face . He shook his head . " I ca n't , I wo n't , tell you , Pa . " Joseph stood up so suddenly , and with so ferocious a face , that even Charles fell back . Joseph said in a quiet but terrible voice , " Do n't defy me , you young jackanapes . Do n't tell me you ca n't ' or wo n't . ' I 'll not have that impudence from you , that lack of respect , that insult . Out with it ! " Charles had recovered himself . He said , " Mr. Armagh , suppose you let Rory tell me what it is , between us two , and let me be the judge ? Would that satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I 'd never repeat it to anyone ! " Joseph hit his son fiercely across the face , the way he had hit his brother , Sean . But , unlike Sean , Rory did not collapse , did not burst into tears , did not turn away . He rocked on his heels for a moment , then straightened himself , and looked at his father steadily , almostexpressionless . The mark of Joseph 's hand flared out on his cheek . Regret was not a common emotion for Joseph , but all at once , as he stared at his son he felt regret and a kind of deep shame . The boy was fearlessly confronting him in silence . He would endure any punishment to protect his father , and Joseph suddenly understood that and his regret deepened to remorse . Charles stood in silence , a little aghast.  |p403But  Joseph said , in his grudging tone , " All right , then , you wretched young spalpeen , you can keep your damned silly secret , and be damned to you , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you had more sense , and more manhood , than to be affected by lies . I never was . I have accepted humiliations you have n't heard of yet  --  and bided my time . There was only one thing I could never have accepted , and that would have been a filthiness against my parents , my father or my mother . " Rory looked aside . He did not speak . Charles saw that his cheek was quivering . Joseph tried to smile . " There is very little , my son , that would be a real calumny against me . So , take it with more ease than you did this time . Very well . You may go . " Rory bowed shortly to his father and then to Charles . It was at Charles that he looked directly , and it was with great respect and a glint of admiration . Then he left the room , walking stiffly , his head held high , his shoulders squared . When he had gone Joseph shook his head and laughed his grating laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , and let him know , about myself , he still is squeamish . I do n't like that , Charles . " " He has courage , and that is a rare virtue , " said Charles . " He is like a rock . He wo n't give way ; he wo n't crumble . It 's not so much a matter of rectitude , but of honor . " Joseph was pleased . But he shrugged . " There 's no place for honor in this world , " he said . " My father never understood that , and so he perished . Well , then . Let us get on with the matter of the Honorable Mr. Masters . " He looked at Charles . " Yes , the lad has courage , has n't he ? I hope it is the right kind . What do you think young Masters said about me , Charles ? " But Charles did not know . However , he wondered how Anthony Masters had come by his knowledge . Someone had been indiscreet . Charles did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " dear friend , Emma Masters , " in a moment of wine-induced lachrymose confidence , and the meek pious Emma , always avid for tidbits which could injure others , had told her husband , and her son had overheard . Like all well-kept secrets , it had been simple to discover . Bernadette did not even remember that hazy evening and the false sympathy of which she had been the victim . Had she remembered she would have been terrified of Joseph 's knowing , but that was the only thing that was importantabout the matter . Besides , she would have thought , Joseph 's infidelities were well known . One more was insignificant , though thisp404was the most unbearable of all . She had discovered it when she was the least aware of discovering anything . The affair of Mr. Burney Masters was absurdly easy for Charles to conclude , far easier than many others he had concluded . He did it with almost immediate dispatch . " Old Syrup , " the Mayor of Boston , was happy to receive a communicationfrom his dear friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , us Irish , for damn me if anyone else will ever stick with us "  --  which implied that if it was his Honor 's desire to be governor Mr. Armagh would oblige him with a breath-taking campaign contribution , or , betterstill , if he desired to be a senator Mr. Armagh was on the most amiable terms with many of the Massachusetts members of the legislature . In fact , Mr. Armagh 's influence in Washington , itself , was stupendous . " Old Syrup " enthusiastically hated the Brahmins of Boston who had tried to defeat him , had humiliated him and despised him during his struggling and desperate political career , and had exploited him and starved him in their manufactories and mills in his earliest youth . He gave Charles Devereaux a quick and friendly vignette of those days , as they sat together drinking brandy and smoking cigars in the mayor 's lavish offices in City Hall . His first young wife had died of " the consumption " for lack of food and warmth and adequate shelter . During her funeral Mass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their masters  --  and her very poor wooden coffin had been befouled , as well as the Host . The priest had been beaten unconscious , and the mourners scattered with blows . " Even the little colleens . " " I tell you , sir , " said the mayor to Charles Devereaux , " not even the darkies in the South was ever treated the way us Irish was treated in this country , I am thinking . You 're a Southerner , sir ? I heard it in your voice . Slaveowners , eh ? But you took care of them . You 've got to be oppressed , Mr. Devereaux sir , or your people oppressed , to know what it 's like . " He looked at Charles 's patrician face and fine clothing with a sort of belligerence . " But , you do n't know , do you ? " " I have some imagination , your Honor , " said Charles , with a smile . " Well , your Dada and your Mum was probably rich plantation owners . Do n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , anyway . We Irish got long memories . We do n't forget easy . Well . So Joe wants to put a hard hand on Burney Masters , does he ? " Charles had laid a thick sheaf of gold banknotes on the desk at the very beginning , and in some admirable fashion they had disappearedp405as if into blank air . Nothing was said about them , out of respect , not even a word of thanks . Mr. Burney Masters , about four years ago , had been caught in flagrante delicto with a pretty young shoeshine lad only twelve years old . " Right there , in his own garden , on Beacon Hill , " said the fat mayor , with glowing satisfaction and many chuckles . " I 'd bin havin ' him watched for a long time . He had that sweet pursy look that men like him have , that lovin ' look . I 'd met his kind before . You would n't think it now , sir , but I was a good-lookin ' lad , meself , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mills . They got the certain look : Anxious . Tender . Lookin ' out for your interests . Always talkin ' concern , and the like , and helpin ' a lad out , advance himself . Soft gentle hands . Writin ' letters to the newspapers , deplorin ' - like exploited labor . ' Gettin ' themselves a reputation for Good Deeds . Sufferin ' for The People . Good causes . Whigs . Busy like bees , protestin ' . Now , I do n't say every man like that is what Masters is , but a hell of a lot of them are . They do n't care much for the wimmin , and the girls . Just lads . " The mayor shook his huge head deploringly . " Scholars , a lot of them . Some of them write books , exposin ' one thing or another . Gives me pleasure , sometimes , to expose ' ern , too . " It seems that the shoeshine lad was not the only one . There was also a very young handyman in the Masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable data concerning himself and other boys and Mr. Burney Masters . " So , " said the mayor , leaning back in his chair , " we had him . A word or two . And that 's how he lost the election . Well , glad to mention it to Mr. Masters , in Joe 's behalf , and that Rory of his . Consider it settled . " It was . Within a few days Rory was back at his school . Young AnthonyMasters , from his infirmary bed , confessed he had " unbearably provoked " Rory by " defaming his father . " " Something , " Mr. Armstead said virtuously , " no manly youth could endure , and certainly no gentleman . We are sad that it led to bad temper and violence , but One can Understand . The Age of Chivalry and Honor has not yet departed . " Rory , resentful inwardly but smiling outwardly , was graduated with honors in June . He did not know how it had all come about but he knew his father was potent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again , but , because of Joseph , Rory restrained himself and kept his eyes fixed ahead , though Anthony stood beside him . Rory was valedictorian of his class , something he had earned himself , and something he did not owe his father . He and Joseph werep406both proud and even Bernadette shed a few public tears and almost forgave Rory for his father 's love . In September Rory entered Harvard . He was to graduate four years later summa cum laude . Joseph Armagh never knew exactly when he had become conscious of Elizabeth Hennessey as a desirable woman . He did not ask himself , for he was no tyro at physical attraction , nor did women as people ever occur to him , except for his mother and Regina , and , perhaps , Sister Elizabeth , long since dead . When he became aware of Elizabeth his own daughter , Ann Marie , was only six years old and Kevin had just been born . Elizabeth , four years older than Bernadette , had come to live in the Hennessey house with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke . Though Bernadette had constantly maligned her and her " poor thing " of a son , and had resented her presence , Joseph was indifferently aware that Elizabeth was a reserved woman with beautifulmanners . She was also very pretty in a cool aristocratic way which did not particularly appeal to him . He preferred stupid romping women of zest and laughter and animal ebullience who made no demands on him and who were easily forgotten . In any event he would not have , deliberately , noticed the widow of Tom Hennessey . Anyone connected with the senator held only aversion for him , including Bernadette , and , at that time , his own children . He had offered to manage Elizabeth 's affairs from his own office . That had been a matter of courtesy . He had expected her to refuse . But she had accepted . She had a rather cold face , somewhat neutral , with a slight thin nose that occasionally had a pinched expression , a still and dimly colored mouth , and large greenish eyes flecked with gold . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be striking . She was too slender , as well as tall , to be in fashion , yet she dressed with rich and quiet style , hardly noticeable . Her slender hands were always ringless except for her wedding ring , which she had removed lately . She looked at the world with unruffled interest and acceptance , and apparently had no attachment to anyone except her son , Courtney , and even with him she was aloof . Her son was very like her in appearance , manner , and silent movement . It was not for many years that Joseph learned that Courtney and Rory were deeply fond of each other , and that there was between themp407a sort of David and Jonathan affection . Certainly no two youths were ever so dissimilar in temperament , outlook , and ambitions , for Courtney , though intelligent , according to Rory , was a poor scholar and rather languid and inactive . Joseph did not notice , for a long while , that Courtney and his mother had a strange way of communicating without language . A mere exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , the slightest gesture of a hand , and they understoodeach other perfectly . But before Joseph saw this he had thought Elizabeth and her son to be strangers , uninterested in each other , and only elaborately polite when together . Courtney , according to the disdainful Bernadette , was not only a " poor thing , " because he was so pallid in contrast to Rory , but he " ailed , " she would say with contempt . Certainly Joseph vaguely noticed that the boy appeared to be at home too often when he , himself , arrived in Green Hills , and there had to be a tutor during the summer months for him if he were to advance in his classes in the school in Boston which Rory attended . Rory , himself , often tutored Courtney , and would sometimes mockinglycall him " Uncle Courtney , " which , for some peculiar reason was a source of mild hilarity to the boys . It was the only time Joseph ever heard the older boy laugh outright , and the only time he would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bony fist , and calling Rory " you fat Irish hooligan . " Courtney , himself , was thin almost to emaciation , and Bernadette scornfully reportedhim as " playing with his food , and we have the best cooks in town . " The presence of Elizabeth and her son in this house finally hotly infuriated Bernadette , who found Elizabeth 's calm and lack of responsiveness " unnatural . " Though Courtney was her half brother she could not endure him . When she learned that he wrote " poems , " she nodded her head and said sagely , " Well , that 's to be expected , is n't it ? " as if the writing of poems was somehow unmanly and depraved . She never learned that Rory also wrote poetry , though not with the fineness and delicacy of Courtney 's . It was when Courtney was about seven years old that Joseph became aware of Elizabeth Hennessey for the first time , beyond the mere fact of her quiet presence at the dining table or in passing her in the wide marble halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in her passage , but she rarely spoke . She was apparently as indifferent to him as he was to her and noticed him about as much . There were very large and elaborate and expensive conservatories in the rear of the Hennessey house , and attached to it , so thatp408one walked down a short hall into boskiness and fragrance and exotic foliage and flowers at any time of the year . It was the one spot in the mansion that really attracted Joseph , and he often spent time in the conservatories , silently watching the assiduous gardeners or sitting in a corner content to breathe in the humid and perfumed air . Sometimes he did ask the name of a flower or a particularly spectacular plant . It never failed to interest him that when the winter snows lay heavily on the grounds and on the roofs the flowers bloomed in their tropical splendor as if eternal summer lay about them , and volcanic lakes . One day before the Christmas holidays Joseph strolled into the conservatories . It was a gloomy day of thick gray snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chimneys , and dark . The conservatories were particularly fragrant just now with the scent of roses and lilies in forced bloom , and there was also a fugitive scent of almond from somewhere and a breathing of warm fecund earth . Gaslightsflickered and illuminated the broad glass windows against which the snow hissed and the wind battered . Joseph thought himself alone , for this was the dinner hour of the gardeners and their day 's work was done . He saw before him the long aisles between the plants and the rainbow colors of flowers , and prepared to wander among them . Then he heard another door open from another section of the house , a rapid tattoo of footsteps , and then Bernadette'sloud , and now somewhat shrill voice railing in outraged anger . " Elizabeth ! How dare you cut my white rosebuds ! You know very well that they are for our Christmas Day dinner ! Such effrontery , not even to ask me ! Such  --  such impudence ! " It was the voice she used to servants . Joseph stopped , half-hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joseph heard a rustle of silk and then he saw Elizabeth 's pale blond head rising between two aisles at his left , and at some distance . The gaslight fluttered on her white face . She said in a voice that was particularlylovely yet without real intonation , and certainly without emotion , " I am sorry , Bernadette . I wanted to ask you but you were upstairs with a headache and I did n't want to disturb you . I 've only cut half a dozen , and there are so many dozens left . Courtney is in bed with that awful cold of his , and he does like white roses so , and I thought I 'd cut these few for him . " Bernadette never learned that a restrained voice meant dignity and control of strong feeling or good manners , especially in women . She thought such a voice was servile , fit only for servants , and that the possessorwas timid , humble , inferior , and worthy only of abuse and per/emptory correction . Or worse still , afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not learned to the contrary . " Oh , you wanted them for that sickly , miserable son of yours , did you ? " Bernadette shouted with coarse derision . Now Joseph could see her , in her scarlet velvet dress which was too small for her slightly obese figure , her curled head bobbing with hateful emphasis , her plump flat face distorted with contempt and ridicule . " He 's always abed like a consumptive girl in a decline ! Now , let me tell you something , ElizabethHennessey ! This is ' my house , and I am mistress here , and you and your son are here only by my sufferance and good nature and regardfor my father , and from this time hence you are to ask me for any favor , for any flowers , for any decisions , and not have the impertinence to do what you will without regard for my station ! " She snorted . " And yours . If you have any , which you do not . " She had never spoken so to Elizabeth like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , if not polite or considerate , or least a little courteous though forced . Her spiteful remarks about Courtney and Elizabeth had never been in their presence , but only to Joseph and her friends . Elizabeth stood there in silence before this virago whose dislike and hatred and resentment had suddenly broken forth from any controls she had heretofore kept over them for the sake of vague decency in the presence of others . " I want to tell you something else too , my woman ! " Bernadette continued to shout . " I 've wanted to tell you this for a long time and only refrained out of respect for my father . He never could endure you . " Her face was gloating with elation and joy that she could finally vent her stifled loathing on Elizabeth . It actually shone in the gaslight . Her mouth spread in a grin of delight and her eyes glittered with glee at the thought that she was wounding and injuring Elizabeth . " He was forced to marry you and adopt your brat , because your father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know that no one really believed you were the widow of a war hero , and that Courtney is his son , miss ! You were probably a wanton woman and do n't even know the paternity of your son . You , with your namby-pamby ways and graces and pretensions of being a lady  --  you who cohabited with a man to whom you were not married and God knows how many other men ! Do n't you know you are the laughingstock of half a dozen cities , not to mention Green Hills ? You are absolutely shameless . You go among respectable people of propriety and reputation as if you deservedto be in their company , and not on the streets where you reallyp410belong , and only the fact that you are my father 's widow prevents my friends from drawing aside their skirts when you appear . You are hardly more than a strumpet , and everybody knows it ! " Elizabeth 's face had changed . It had become rigid and immobile . She said , in her chilly voice , " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and your mother left you her share . I pay my portionhere , and my son 's expenses . " She fixed the panting Bernadette with her great green eyes . " I will not reply to your filthy insinuations , which are worthy of you , Bernadette , for you are a vulgar and cruel woman . You are without sensibilities or ordinary decency , and if you are avoided by your family it is your own fault . " " What ! " screamed Bernadette , advancing a few more paces towards Elizabeth . " Do n't come any nearer me , " said Elizabeth , and now her face and voice were charged with passion . " I warn you . Do n't come nearer . " Joseph , to his amused amazement , saw the desire to kill on Elizabeth 's face , and with it her desperate fight for control over her unbelievable rage . " I want you out of this house , my house , tomorrow ! " shrieked Bernadette . " Bag and baggage , out of my house ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave it when I desire , and not before . " Elizabeth 's voice was louder but still under control . She held the roses tightly . " These , too , are my flowers , as well as yours , and I will cut them when I will , and not defer to you at any time , from this day forward . " Bernadette raised her arm , her fist clenched , and she advanced directly in front of Elizabeth , and her face was evil with rage . But Elizabethcaught that arm in mid-air , as the fist was descending on her , and with a gesture of full loathing and disgust she flung Bernadette from her with such strength that Bernadette staggered , tried to get her balance , fell against the plants near her , then fell heavily to the floor . Instantlyshe yelled like a banshee , and she uttered imprecations that Joseph had not believed she knew . They were full of foul words and gaspings . Elizabeth looked down at her , then turned with dignity and scorn and moved up the aisles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stopped abruptly , and scarlet waves ran over her white face . Her green eyes were blazing with an ardor and anger he never guessed she was capable of , and her mouth was parted . Bernadette was still howling threats on the floor , and struggling to rise . Joseph smiled at Elizabeth . " I am glad you said that , and did that , "
