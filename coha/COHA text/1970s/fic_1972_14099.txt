Tira picks off a piece and examines it . ) Ham and cheese roll . ( She eats it . ) With mustard . ( Brute laughs . She sits on his lap , faces close . She pecks at his chewing mouth . He kisses her roughly . They roll on to the stage , in an embrace . Brute holds his sandwich out , trying to rescue it from ruin . ) BRUTE Hey , my ham ' nd cheese . ( Tira shriekes with laughter . ) TIRA With mustard ! ( Brute , broody , sits back on the block and resumes his eating . ) Oh , me , oh my , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blubber-guts , what else can you show me ? Besides chewing , I mean . p. 30 BRUTE I 'm eating . TIRA You 're a slob . ( Brute gulps and belches . ) And a poet . Smashing . Terrific . What do you know that rhymes with belch , slob ? Blubber-guts . ( Brute belches again . ) Bravo . That 's right . Uninspired , but spot on , spot on . BRUTE Hey , I 'm getting mighty sick of you . TIRA They all do . Tell me something poetic , slob . Beautiful . ( She laughs . ) Oh God . Well , he ai n't much , but he 's all mine . BRUTE I 'm trying to eat . TIRA I know that . BRUTE Lay off , huh ? TIRA No . I 'm enjoying this . BRUTE Look , it ai n't gon na work again . TIRA I 'm Tira . BRUTE I 'm eating . ( Brute roars with laughter . Tira slaps the sandwich from his hand . ) TIRA ( Nasty . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandwich ! You got no right . Pick it up . TIRA Talk to me of daffodils . p. 31 BRUTE Pick up my fucking sandwich . TIRA Go on , hit me . BRUTE Jesus , you 're nuts , kid . TIRA Take me . ( Brute takes up the sandwich and grinds it in Tira 's face . He then sits and polishes an apple from his lunchpail . Tira cleans her face . ) Hey , I did n't like that . I did n't enjoy it . You know what I think , fatso ? I think that deep down inside you there is a delicate soul longing to burst forth . ( Tira becomes a flower in growth . ) Hey , look at me . BRUTE What 's that all about ? TIRA Tell me what I am . BRUTE Hey , you better not be a witch . If you 're doing like a witch , I wan na know , ' cause I do n't go in for that . TIRA I 'm being something . Tell me what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing . See ? An Iris . I 'm an Iris . BRUTE What ? TIRA I 'm being an iris growing . Do n't you think I look like an iris ? It 's a flower . An iris is a flower . BRUTE You 're a flower , huh ? ( Brute roars with laughter. ) p. 32 TIRA ( Angry . ) O.K. , fatty-fatso , let 's see what you can do . ( Brute stands , strikes a pose and belches . ) Bravo ! BRUTE That was nice . I liked that . How 'd you like being a flower ? ( Brute laughs . ) TIRA Oh clever . Clever-clever . Clever-Charlie . Clever-head . Smarty pants . ( Tira tickles him . ) BRUTE Cut it out . TIRA I like it . BRUTE Stop doing that . It aggravates me . ( Brute throws Tira aside . She sprawls , laughing . ) God damn it . God damn you . ( Brute cries . ) Shit , tickling . Son of a bitch , I 'm crying in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pail . Tira stops and turns away from Brute . She looks at the audience as if she 's afraid to turn and see what Brute is doing . ) TIRA He is n't going away , is he ? No , he 's sneaking up behind me . He 's sneaking up and he 's going to put his hands over my eyes and say , " Guess who ? " No , he 's going . I did n't mean to make him go . I swear I did n't . ( Pause . ) He 's pissed off , has n't he ? Pity , that . Those kind make the best husbands , according to Woman 's Weekly . I mean , you always know where you are with them , do n't you ? ( Brute has gone . Tira examines the empty block . ) Took his lunch . Just as well . I do n't fancy mustard with ham and cheese . God damn it , what 's wrong with me ? They all go away . I just want to know , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry about all this . There 's only one more bit to go . It 's short . I wrote home once . I said , " Dear Mum . Dear Dad . Love Tira . " It was a busy week , you see . Lots of news . Christ , have you ever seen such bloody self-pity ? ( Enter Tib . He is lean and stringy . Shy . Broody . He sits on the block with his head between his legs . ) Yes , that 's right . There was this boy on the bus one day . He was just sitting there . Our eyes met . He did n't say a thing , but his eyes told the whole story . They said he 'd been dreaming of a girl like me all his life and and ( Pause . ) I warned you I read Woman 's Weekly . ( Pause . ) I 'm not moving because if I do , he might go away . I might try talking to him , but I ca n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let me stay with you and if I do say something , ignore it because everything I say is stupid and ignorant , like me , but I 'd like you to like me and and ( Pause . ) Oh , hell , I 'll take a step . ( Tira takes one step towards Tib . ) So far so good . He did n't move . I seem to be handling this with uncommon tact , do n't you think ? Try another . ( She takes another step . ) Perhaps he does n't know I 'm here . It was the other end of the bus . I forgot to tell you . I only saw him get on . There were a lot of other people sitting between us . ( Pause . ) Ahem . ( Pause . ) Ahem . ( Tib looks up . ) He 's looking up . ( Tib looks back down . ) The point is , he did look up . He did . He must have seen me . Yes , he saw me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad . He did n't go away . Ahem . May I ? Hey ? You ? Ahem . May I ? ( Tib looks up . ) Please ? ( Tib looks down . ) He seems a bit shy . Perhaps he 's a mute . I 'm not complaining . A mute will do . Would do . If . Then again , I would n't complain if it turned out he could talk . Hey , I 'm coming over , O.K. ? Hey , is that all right ? Here I come . Sneak-sneak . Hey ? ( She tiptoes over . ) May I sit next to you ? I 'm sitting . Yoo-hoo . Look at me . Sit-sit . ( She sits . ) Here I am . Hey , can you talk ? ( Tib rises . ) Please do n't go . Please stay . You 're nice . I like you . Not too much . I mean , not yet . I 'm trying not to be overbearing . I hope you appreciate that . ( Tib sits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tib . ) Can you talk ? p. 33 TIB Yes . TIRA Thank God for that . My name 's Tira . What 's yours ? Am I going too fast ? Please talk to me . If you say something , I 'll lick you behind the ears . Not sexually . I 'm not sexually dominant . You do n't fancy sexually dominant women , I can tell . You do n't , do you ? Do you ? I mean , if you do , I am sexually dominant . But I do n't think you do . I 'm doing most of the talking . This is looking like a very one-sided relationship . I 'll give you a " **27;545;TOOLONG " type lick . But wet . Move your hand . ( Tib shakes his head " no " . ) You would n't like a nice , moist , friendly lick behind the ear ? ( Tib starts to rise again . ) No , stay . I 'll be quiet . Wo n't say a word . ( Tib sits . Long pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gets pretty boring , does n't it ? TIB ( Long pause . ) Please . TIRA ( Quickly . ) Yes ? What ? TIB Lick . TIRA You want me to lick you ? TIB Please . TIRA Sexually , or otherwise ? ( Pause . ) Not saying . Right . Guess . ( Pause . ) Otherwise . ( Tira starts to lick . She stops . ) Look , do something for me . Anything . Just something I can repay you for . I ca n't give you an otherwise lick behind the ear if it is n't to thank you for something you 've done for me . Does that make sense ? Try moving your hand . ( Tib moves his hand to her face and touches it . ) Yes , very good . Like that . Now I can thank you . ( Tira licks him behind the ear . He does n't smile . ) Was that nice ? Did you like that ? ( Tib nods . ) I like you . Very much . Please . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Lovely , you know , but weird . It 's exotic . TIB So is Tira . TIRA You remembered . Yes . Two weird names . Just like in the magazines . Are you frightened of me ? No , you do n't have to answer that . I 'm pushing . TIB ( Slowly . ) Am I TIRA What ? Handsome ? ( Tib nods . ) Handsome , yes . Talkative , no . Ca n't you think of a single thing to say ? TIB What ? TIRA I do n't know . Anything that comes to mind . Ramble . TIB I ca n't . TIRA Poor Tib . Poor Tib . Ca n't even ramble . ( Tib rises . ) No , I was n't making fun , honestly . Please do n't listen to what I say . Ignore me . Just be with me , but ignore me . I know . I 'll give you something , then you can thank me for it . Thanking is legitmate talk . I 'll give you a strand of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn . Here . ( Tib refuses it . ) What 's wrong with my hair ? I hurt myself pulling it out . I 'm making sacrifices . TIB It 's dead . Hair is dead . Like fingernails and teeth . p. 35 TIRA How about a cuticle ? TIB That 's dead . TIRA You 're a vicious little fellow on the quiet . ( Tib starts to leave . ) Blood ! How about some blood ? That has cells in it . Cells are alive . I can prick my finger . TIB All right . ( Sits . ) TIRA Do you have a penknife ? TIB No . TIRA Anything sharp ? I ca n't prick myself without something sharp . TIB Use your teeth . Bite . TIRA That 's masochism . ( Pause . ) Yes , well , it 's only blood , after all . Lucky thing my blood clots quickly . Would n't settle for a cuticle . Naturally not . ( Tira bites herself , drawing blood . Tib watches . ) TIB Bite hard with the incisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood vessel and you 'll get a nice , clean wound . TIRA That hurt , damn it . TIB I 'm sorry . TIRA I 'll bet you are . All right , my blood . Now what ? ( Tib licks the finger clean. ) p. 36 TIB Now we 're like brother and sister . TIRA Oh , no , I 've heard about that . You 're supposed to mingle blood . Yours and mine . You 'll have to cut yourself first , and you 'd better do it quickly because I 'm starting to clot and I 'm buggered if I 'm going to do it again . TIB I would , Tira , but I saw how much pain it caused you . The world is already too full of pain . TIRA A moralist , no less . TIB You may kiss me . You 'll get some blood back mixed with my saliva . TIRA You 're certainly talking a lot all of a sudden . TIB You do n't have to kiss me . TIRA Oh hell , here I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TIRA It was all right . TIB I mean , how did I kiss ? TIRA What am I supposed to say ? It was fine . Just fine . TIB You know something ? TIRA I know my finger hurts . TIB You kiss very nicely , too . TIRA Thank you , Tib . You 're very sweet . p. 37 TIB Almost as well as me . TIRA What ? TIB It 's a question of experience . You 're still very young . But still , for your age , you kiss quite nicely . TIRA Hey , I thought you were all modest and shy ? TIB I am , Tira , but I kiss fantastically well . TIRA Well , I mean , it was a fair kiss , certainly TIB No , it was a kiss like no other you 've ever tasted . TIRA It was all right . So-so . I enjoyed it . Nothing special , technically speaking . TIB Tira , I know Edward and Poof and Lucio and Brute and I know they do n't kiss as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIRA Look , if you 're going to be like that , it was a bloody awful kiss . Awful . Any one of the others could have kissed you off the street . I made you kiss like that . It was probably the best kiss you ever kissed , come to that , and even so it was n't all that hot , nothing to write home about . You could n't tie your shoes without me ! ( Tib rises to go . ) No , no , I did n't mean it . I warned you not to listen to me . Yes , yes , of course it was the best kiss ever . Tib , I love you , please stay with me . I 'll leave you alone . I 'll ask nothing of you . I 'll give and give and ask nothing in return . I 'll cook and clean and scrub and wait for you every night and never ask where you 've been or whom you 've seen , I swear . Do what you will , I 'm yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . TIB And lie about you to friends ? TIRA Yes , yes . TIB And bring the others back home ? TIRA Yes , oh yes . TIB And you 'll cook for them and offer them your bed and bring up the children I have by them ? TIRA My God , all this on that little bit of blood ? TIB Will you ? TIRA Yes . TIB Debase yourself before my eyes ? TIRA Yes , yes , anything and everything , yes , now and for evermore . TIB No one with an ounce of self-respect would go near you . ( Tib spins on his heels and walks off . ) TIRA Tib ! ! ! ( Tira moans and sobs throughout this speech . ) Yes , I know I know I know . I said I would n't . I 'm trying very hard to stop . It 's not easy . Keeps burbling up . Disgusting thing , tears . Mucks up the complexion . Causes pimples . ( She stops crying . ) There . I think we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause . Thinks . ) That 's about all there is to it . I mean , if you see me on the street , say hello . " Hello , Tira , I know all about you . " You do n't , of course . It 's my fault . Left school at fifteen . Never learned to express myself properly . There 's just one more thing . I 'm about to commit suicide . Hang on for a minute and you 'll see it . I 've thought it over . I mean , why should you have to listen to all this drivel about me if I just up and walk away ? At least if I commit suicide you 'll read about it in the papers and you 'll be able to say oh , terrible thing , such a pity , she had a hard time . ( She giggles to herself . ) The trouble is sorry , this is quite funny you see , I 'm going to commit suicide by holding my breath . Have you ever heard of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure it wo n't work . Poor people , having to watch all this . At least I get to do it . O.K. Ready ? Tira , having told everything there is to know about herself , which is nothing , now commits suicide . ( Tira braces herself and holds her breath . A drum roll starts offstage . The Man enters and stands behind Tira miming a drum and pretending to make the noise with his mouth . ) Oh , yes , drums . Very dramatic . ( She holds her breath again . For an entire fifteen seconds she crumbles to the floor in slow motion while the Man continues to play more and more frantically behind . With a final burst of the drum Tira dies . The man sprinkles flower petals or confetti over Tira and exits . Pause . Tira opens her eyes , feels herself and sits . To audience . ) Woops . Well , anyway , that 's one thing about me . I 'm consistent . ( Tira freezes in the middle of an awkward gesture timed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she utters her last word . BLACKOUT. )
