txt The major New York City banks have informally submitted stringent new proposals for an independent agency to control city budgets , but City Hall aides said the proposals were " stiffer " than what had been offered so far and were very likely " unacceptable " to Mayor Beame . As a result , city officials said yesterday that , for the first time , aides to Mr. Beanie and City Compttoller Harrison J. Goldin had begun exploring alternative means of redeeming the city 's $1 billion in moratorium debts  --  without reliance on the banks or , necessarily , the need to agree to their terms . " The city and all the parties are exploring all options , " said one senior official at City Hall , declining to comment further on what they might be . Tighter Pursestrings Suggested Among the suggestions by the banks , it was learned , were proposals to give a new outside review agency power to approve all city borrowings , to approve city budgets even before they were adopt ed officially and to " cost out " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knowledgeable official said , was for the city to retain a much larger budgetary cushion for spending overruns and revenue shortfalls than had been proposed by the city . The suggestion was that this reserve be put into place on a faster timetable than the city had said was practical . Several City Hall aides declined to comment on reports of the bank proposals . // One official who had been in on some negotiations said lie had understood them to have been advanced , although he said they had not been stated formally . Banking officials were unavailable for comment . All the proposals were not simply encountering resistance at City Hall ; they were also seen as likely to incur the anger of municipal labor unions , which fear that any new control mechanism would permanently undermine collective bargaining in the city as well as increased wages and benefits . The banks  --  led by Chase Manhattan , Citibank , the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bankers Trust  --  are scheduled to make a formal presentation of their proposals on Friday at City Hall . although sonic effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ideas into Writing today . Mr. Beame charged ' earlier this week that the banks were holding " a gun at our heads " by delaying their first formal response on an outside control agency until Friday , which is only a week away freim the time that fiscal officials have said tile city is due to run out of cash . The pressure has been on the city because its normal sources of cash  --  the municipal employee-pension funds and the ' Federal Government  --  have withdra , : vn , pending resolution of the city 's moratorium crisis . The pension systems said they could not make their loans because the SI billionjudgment hanging over the city ? created after the Senate Court of Appeals struck down the city 's debt moratorium ? posed a danger of municipal insolvency . The Federal Government , echoing this argument and concluding that it . might not he repaid , denied the city a 5255 million short-term loan . At the same time both these parties have been privately mindful of the increasing pressure that their refusals were putting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case of the pension systems , the municipal labor trustees are counting on such a settlement to be on their terms ,  --  a s that is , without the use and without the outside controls a city bond would likely require . The alternatives before the city , in light of the banks ' new suggestions , were said to have been discussed at an unusual meeting in Washington Tuesday night with First Deputy Mayor John E. Zuccotti : David W. Burke , secretary to Governor Carey ; Felix G. Rohatyn , chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation , Kenneth S. Axelson , Under Secretary of the Treasury-designate and former Deputy Mayor for Finance of New York City . 1i the city turns away from the banks , and tries to find the money elsewhere , it was reported to have few options . Nonetheless city officials were said to be exploring the following : ( A new issue of so-called " second resolution " M.A.C , bonds , which are backed by state aid and not the stock-transfer and sales taxes that support other M.A.C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : r o : ' housing mortgages in tile Mitchell-Lama program . ( . ; . -% so-called M.A.C . " stretch " ? that is , a deferral of principal payments on M.A.C . bonds by the pension funds , but not the banks , which have refused to go along with the " stretch " unless their fears over legal challenges to the M.A.C . are resolved . Also being explored was the possibility of another so-called " exchange offer " for the city 's creditors  --  in other words , offering the holders of city short-term notes , now under the moratorium , the same chance to exchange their notes for M.A.C . bonds that they were offered earlier this year , without much result . An exchange might be attractive , one official said , if there is no long-term solution to the city 's crisis situation . " You take it as a given that if you have a negotiation that seems to be headed for possible failure , you 're going to scrape around to see if there are any alternatives to failure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind of things we 've done before . But it 's better than going into the tank . "
