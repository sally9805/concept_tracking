VETERANS in the congressional press gallery could scarcely remember when the House of Representatives had ever acquiesced so easily and completely to a far-ranging piece of legislation . Last week President Nixon 's proposal to reduce federal taxes for both corporations and individuals-the other major part of his domestic economic program besides Phase II-slid through the lower house without even a roll-call vote . Its quick passage was evidence of just how commandingly the President has seized the economic issue , and how willing Congress had been to let him have his way . <P> In part , that is because Nixon has adopted many of the ideas long urged on him by Democrats , including one of the most powerful of them , Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills . Last week Mills acknowledged the President 's ability now to get the tax legislation that he wants from Congress . Just before the tax-bill vote , Mills said : " It 's all cut and dried . " <P> Certainly the Administration faces harder going in the Senate than in the House . Almost all the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their personal stamp on the bill . They will likely concentrate on giving more tax breaks to individuals , a job that Finance Committee Chairman Russell Long last week said the upper house is " in the mood " to perform . As passed by the House , the Nixon measure already provides some tax reduction for individuals . A family of four with an income of $15,000 would save about $22 on its income tax bill for this year and $44 next year . Long expects final passage of a more generous tax-relief bill by this month 's end . <P> The bill 's progress through the legislative gauntlet , where several of the President 's key programs have previously been whipped to the sidelines , has been enormously helped by the Capitol Hill diplomacy of Treasury Secretary John Connally . Last week , while testifying before the Senate Finance Committee , Connally cannily gave his blessing to several " reasonable " changes drafted by the House , including more tax relief for low-income families . He also accepted a House measure raising the standard rate of proposed investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the economy a greater initial spurt , however , he asked the Senate to restore a House-cut premium rate of 10% for capital goods bought during the first year covered by the bill . <P> Whatever level it finally sets , the Senate would be well advised to eliminate right now the provision of the new investment credit that bans foreign-made machinery from qualifying for the tax break . That rule is supposed to be dropped when Nixon removes the 10% surtax on all imported goods . But the protectionist rule , which has the effect of adding to the price of non-American capital goods above and beyond the increases brought about by the surcharge and monetary changes , is already fiercely resented abroad and with good reason . In the past , U.S. trade officials have registered strong opposition when foreign governments adopted similar measures that might impede American exports .
