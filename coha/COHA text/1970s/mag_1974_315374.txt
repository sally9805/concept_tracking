THE OUTFIT <P> Directed and Written by <P> JOHN FLYNN <P> Any humble hopes for this poorhouse thriller evaporate in the opening sequence . Two mob gunmen arrive at a back-country farm to make a hit . Their quarry is doing some chores . Without a word , they confront him , pull their weapons , shoot him twice in the heart , and go away . Around his still body his pet dog capers and moans . Over in the corral a horse paces desperately . And the screen door on the porch bangs open and closed in the wind . Cliches are not the exclusive province of dialogue . <P> The Outfit is the sort of yarn ( ex-con goes up against the Mob biggies for revenge ) that needs to have every moment blasted by visual invention . Director Flynn makes a movie that has been seen before , without either the skill or spirit that distinguished such excellent predecessors as Point Blank and Get Carter . <P> Robert Duvall , a fine actor shipwrecked here , plays the same part that Lee Marvin played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Richard Stark thrillers . The supporting cast is spiked with faces familiar from other criminal excursions ( Elisha Cook , Marie Windsor , Emile Meyer , Sheree North ) . Their presence was probably intended to be an affectionate homage , but just increases the enervating familiarity of the entire enterprise . Robert Ryan , looking worn ( this was one of his last roles ) , appears as Mr. Big , who is constantly being irritated by his young wife , the egregious Joanna Cassidy . <P> Duvall is a professional criminal , already at odds with the straight world . Now he must also stand against the criminal world as he wages a bloody vendetta against the Mob that had his brother killed . He gets to them by busting up some of their more successful undertakings ( a casino , a bookie parlor ) and turning the profits over to his sister-in-law . He himself waits for a clear shot at Mr. Big , a long and weary wait .                  @ @ @
