Over the throbbing beat of John Lennon 's Give Peace a Chance , the mellifluous voice of a onetime hamburger impresario wafts daily across the Middle East air waves : " This is the voice of peace , broadcasting on 1,542 kilocycles from somewhere in the Mediterranean . <P> This is the voice of love . " For the next nine hours , there is a mixture of music , news and cheerful chatter . The music is often hard : lots of rock interspersed with golden oldies sung in Arabic , Hebrew and English . But the main pitch is soft : " We will sell peace with music , for everyone with music has a right to love . " <P> The purveyor of harmony in a region of no war , no peace is Iranian-born Abraham ( " Abie " ) Nathan , a former Israeli air force pilot . After making a financial killing with an American-style restaurant in Tel Aviv , in the late 1960s Nathan developed an insatiable hunger for peace . Three times he flew to Egypt , unsuccessfully trying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe promoting peace . <P> Last month he set up his love-oriented radio station aboard a former Dutch coastal vessel , which roams 15 miles off the coasts of Israel and Lebanon . He has pledged not to leave the ship until it can sail through the Suez Canal and dock at Eilat . <P> Nathan is not exactly entering a vacuum with his seductive propaganda for peace .

The Israelis also offer a regular schedule of telecasts in Arabic . <P> Cairo Radio aims at Israel twelve hours of daily broadcasting in Hebrew , English and French .

Particularly in Arab countries , where illiteracy rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of both entertainment and information . Almost every family can afford a cheap transistor , which is able to pick up most of the high-powered stations-including special services of the Voice of America , the BBC , Radio Moscow and Albania 's Radio Tirana-as well as local broadcasts . On the night of a speech by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , Cairo streets echo with the sound of his harsh voice . <P> By far the most inflammatory of the propaganda programs are those by the Palestinian guerrilla movement . After the Israeli commando raid on Beirut in April , a Voice of Palestine broadcast from Algiers called on Arabs to " kill everyone who is American because all of them work for American intelligence .
