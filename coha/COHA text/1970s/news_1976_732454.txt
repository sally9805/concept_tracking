txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Port Authority : Toward a New Compact To the Editor : The public deserves a better understanding of the Port of New York-New Jersey Authority than is possible from newspaper editorials , blasts by politicians like Mr. Kheet and Governor Byrne and even from the defensive efforts of Mr. Ronan , its board chairman , who was formerly a critic of the Authority , expounding the same critical theme as Mr. Kheel . In a recent letter to The Times , Mr. Kheel says that Governor Rockefeller advised him by letter of August 7 , 1973 , that the authority was created exclusively as an agency of transportation in the port district . Mr. Kheel says that Mr. Ronan , not then chairman of the authority , drafted the Governor 's letter . As full-time chairman of the authority , Mr. Ronan has learned that the authority 's legal responsibilities extend beyond planning and developing a coordinated system of transportation , to promoting the commerce of the port , protecting the port area from discriminatory transportation charges , petitioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of commerce in the port district and purchasing , building , leasing and operating transportation or terminal and other facilities of commerce within the port district . Withal , the AuThe New York Times/April 12 , 1976 Costly Subway Power To the Editor : With the 50-cent subway fare in jeopardy and New York City and New York State in desperate financial straits , it seems incredible that the Power Authority of the State of New York should be about to add a needless $30 million  --  a-year burden to transit costs through a blunder in the location of an atomic power plant . I refer to the proposed nuclear generating station at Cementon in Greene County . In its application to go ahead with the plant , which purportedly will he used to air-condition New York City subways , the Power Authority totally ignores the cost of moving power to the city from Greene County . Not that they are n't aware of the cost of power loss in transmission over such a great distance . A Power Authority spokesman has admitted at a public meeting that transmission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost about $30 million more per year than from a similar plant in or close to the metropolitan area . It seems reasonable to suppose these costs would be the same for any electric power , including that from a nuclear generator , Thus the poor straphanger can anticipate paying a billion dollars or To the Editor : We of the American Jewish community view with alarm the dangerous new American policy toward Israel and the Middle East which has emerged with the lifting of the arms embargo to Egypt and a radical shift of our stated position in the United Nations . The combined force of these moves has seriously undermined Israel 's military and diplomatic position in her fight for survival , and has damaged the prospects for a permanent , negotiated peace in the Middle East . Ambassador Scranton , by his recent questioning of the current status of Jerusalem and criticism of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories utterly ignores the true obstacle to peace  --  the steadfast refusal of the Arab states to acknowledge Israel 's right to exist with secure and recognized boundaries under U.N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council ignores 3,000 years of Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the West Bank , and the fact that an undivided Jerusalem must remain thority must he self-supporting and in no way dependent on taxes . Over the years , the authority has followed through on these responsibilities . It has constructed , purchased and operated well over $3 billion worth of rail , marine , air and other transportation facilities . Each - dollar spent by the authority has made a major contribution to the commerce of the region . All of this has been done without tax money and without the kind of corruption found in government on both sides of the Hudson . For over six years , under political pressure , the authority has had its technical staff tied up on an $800 million rail package which the Federal Government indicates as being excessive in cost for the benefit received and hence not . fundable . The political atmosphere is so charged with respect to the authority that it would be well for the Governors to appoint a committee to review the original port compact and the needs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation for a new compact between the states .

Even a cooler subway car wo n't keep him from getting hot under the collar over needless additional fare increases . Ironically , the Power Authority has stated that it is locating the nuclear plant in Greene County in part because only thousands of lives would be jeopardized by nuclear accident there , as contrasted with millions of lives closer to New York City . How many New Yorkers realize that only a few miles away is the Ashokan reservoir , which is a major supplier of the city 's drinking water ? R. S. MACKELLAR New York , April 6 , 1976 ? Senior Citizen 's Dilemma To the Editor : I am a widowed senior citizen who has lived alone in a rent-controlled building , on a fixed income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent has risen $153 per month , which puts it well over the $300 level , about $100 more than my Social Security check . Should controls be abolished at the $300 level , it would be severe hardship to me and I am sure to countless others in a similar situation . Why not allow a senior citizen 's rent to he frozen until such person 's death or until he or she is forced to move due to ill health or is incapable of living alone ? Meanwhile , the prospect of invading a slender capital looms . I have to hope that it lasts longer than I do . CATHERINE P. MASBACK New York , March 28 , 1976 ? To Sell a Book To the Editor : The advertisement for " Alger Hiss , The True Story " by John Chabot Smith , published by Holt , Rinehart &; Winston , which appeared in The Times on April Fools ' Day , used my name without my consent and without any consultation . I have not seen the hook , and am therefore unfamiliar with its contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 an integral part of the State of Israel . Mr. Scranton 's words only add a false legitimacy to the barrage of twisted Arab propaganda which has already isolated Israel diplomatically . By lifting the arms embargo against Egypt , the United States merely accelerates the arms race in the Middle East , and further tilts the already lopsided balance of arms in favor of the Arabs against Israel . We are only the newest of a long list of arms suppliers to the Arabs , including Russia , England and France , whereas Israel must rely almost solely on the United States for sophisticated military equipment . It is not possible to impose meaningful restrictions on the use of American arms once they are in Arab hands , for , as we have nessed in previous Arab-Israeli wars , the Arab states jointly share their arms . We urge the Congress and the Administration to desist. from this catastrophic new policy before it is too late . HAROLD M. JACOBS President , Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America New York , March 29 , 1976 Of Sex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Right , to Privacy " frightened me considerably . Particularly alarming was your assumption that a recent Supreme Court decision legitimizing an " ancient Virginia statute on private sexual practices " has set a judicial antihomosexuality trend . Since the Court chose not to write an opinion while upholding a lower court 's , the ruling may be of much less consequence than you have sug7 : gested . Besides the theory that stateshave the power to legislate acceptable , sexual mores , there are two other. : reasonings which may have been - foie ? lowed by the Court . The first is that the Court believed ' the plaintiffs , two fictitiously named homosexuals , lacked standing , the right to bring a case to a court . Since : /he plaintiffs ' complaint was that - the , statute inhibited them from exercising what they believed was a constitu- , tional right , they could not clairn ' , tohave been prosecuted by an unconsti : tutfonal law . Therefore , they " act , received no direct injury , only . a speculative one . Speculative injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory was first - ex-  , pounded by Justice Brandeis . Another line of reasoning possibly --  ; used by the Court is much more corn. ; plex , and I confess it still confuses , me even after having studied it . - The-  , case at hand involves a statute which , has produced no prosecutions in cent times and is in that respect similar to a law whose constitutionality was questioned in 1961 . In Poe v. Ullman , a doctor and his patients challenged an 1879 anti-birth : control bill which had been tacitly ; unenforced for decades . Justice Frankfurter , in refusing to rule on " the ' statute , stated that laws such as these , , fall within the concept of desuetude . The The Supreme Court should not inviihie , itself in a matter which a legislature , could not resolve itself  --  the Court must never attempt to relieve : the ' people from the burden of self-* , , government . I hope that it was by one or the above reasonings that the Supreme Court ruled as it did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your editorial . The ' Court may instead he waiting for- amore judiciably ripe case thrqugh which it will expound a liberal philosophy concerning homosexuality . RICHARD CANTOR ? Medford , Mass. , March 31 , 1976 ? ? The Quinlan Precedent To the Editor : The hard-fought Quinlan case may result in landmark decisions that will ' fore er change the nature of our society . It may institutionalize death . Of course , the Quinlans could have ' ? rented a respirator , brought their child ? home , and then done what they felt had to he done . They have asked not only their physician , but the judiciaryand the public to share a difficult burden . There are certain deeds you . ' should not ask your doctor to perform if you would be unwilling to do them - yourself . CHARLES HARRIS , 11CD . Toms River , N. J. , April 2 , 1976 ? ? ? ? Democratic Colombia To the Editor : We should like to rectify the comments of Timothy Ross in the March ' 28 Week in Review article " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colombia is a democracy of long ' standing which has always been able to overcome the economic , fiscal and international problems that beser ' every nation from time to time . What-ever unsafe atmosphere there is milk in Colombia , it is not any greater than ? ' ? what can frequently he found in-the United States , nor does it have ' the importance given by Mr. Ross when ' he states that our democratic systemis at stake . There exists in Colombia a strang , ' ? independent public opinion , as strong as any in the United States , which ' actively participates in the democra- " ' tic process and freely expresses itself . ' on all issues without any distortionof the democratic system . The state - of siege , now temporarily in force . in , ? . Colombia , is governed by legal norms : and does not . represent a threat to . the ' interests of the citizens , but is an  --  effeclive method of preserving public order in situations of emergency . Even within the difficulties of world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been able to curb its rate of inflation . The International Monetary Fund , the World ? ? Bank , the Interamerican DevelopmentBank , the Paris Consultative Graufi ? and in general all the international financial institutions have the highest opinion of the way Colombia has been managing its economic , fiscal and fi- ' ? nancial policy . The United States Treasury itself listed Colombia among ' the group of six developing noticing , nonexporters of nil in the world , that show the best economic situation .

Mr , Ross ? is simply not aware of the strength ? of our democratic institutions , Tile Government , the national majority ' ? and the armed forces , all united , keep watch on our republican institutions , ? There are terrorists , some guerrilla activity and some drug traffickers who in connection with the United States Mafia work against the law , hut Colombia is fighting them , and democracy in our country is in nn way threatened .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
