Making that Rx just right <P> Nothing has done as much to revolutionize treatment of serious mental illness as the development of drugs like Thorazine . Since their introduction about a generation ago , these powerful antipsychotics have freed tens of thousands of patients from the despair of mental institutions . Some patients have even resumed normal , useful lives . Yet as important as the miracle drugs have been , they are not without serious drawbacks . <P> Because the antipsychotics affect different patients in different ways , doctors can never be sure just how effective a particular agent or dosage will be ; they simply prescribe by trial and error . The medication may not work at all or , if the dose is too high , it may produce annoying , even dangerous , side effects . <P> So far , doctors have had little help out of this bind , since few precise tests have been generally available to tell them if and how well the body will respond to a prescribed drug . But aid may now finally be on the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his colleagues , Ian Creese and Dr. Larry Tune , have developed a simple blood test that should be especially useful in treating the nation 's estimated 2 million to 5 million schizophrenics . Already tested on 30 patients , it is based on pioneering studies of the brain 's receptors , or molecular sites to which its own drug-like chemicals bind-almost as if they were keys in a lock . A blood sample from a patient is added to a tube containing animal brain tissue and a radioactively tagged chemical known to bind to particular receptors . Whatever drug is in the patient 's blood displaces the test chemical at these sites , and the radioactive tracer left behind can easily be measured , giving doctors a precise indication of the levels of the prescribed drug in the blood-and thus a firm indication of how the body is utilizing it . <P> &gt; At Harvard , Dr. Joseph Schildkraut and his colleagues have devised a urine test that can distinguish types of depressive disorders and hence indicate the best available drug for treatment . <P> The trick : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain chemical . <P> By comparing results from more than 30 patients suffering varying degrees of depression , they were able to establish two groups : those below a certain urine level responded to relatively low dosages of a test drug ; those above either did not respond or had to be given stiff dosages . <P> Both tests are clearly still in the preliminary stage of development and may not be generally available for several years . For doctors and patients , that will be none too soon .
