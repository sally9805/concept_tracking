It has been two years since the disaster at Consol No. 9 trapped 78 men in a trembling , burning tomb beneath Marion County , W. Va . Consol No. 9 was one of the worst tragedies in the history of an industry that has seen tens of thousands of tragedies , and for the families the end of it has not yet been reached . TIME Correspondent Arthur White visited the small communities near Farmington. where the wives , children and parents of Consol No. 9 's victims - 222 dependents in all-search to honor the dead . His report : <P> THE timbered , rolling hills of Marion County have seen death , and the markers dot the landscape . Here 361 perished at Monongah in 1907 . There is Mount Calvary Cemetery where hundreds of them were buried in mass graves . In Farmington , there is a monument to 16 men killed in Consol No. 9 in 1954 . Up the street races a boy whose father died in those same shafts two years ago . Out at the entrance to the Llewellyn Portal-the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame holds a dozen bouquets put there on the second anniversary of the most recent Marion County mining disaster . The wreaths bear the phrases : " In loving memory , " " Sadly missed . " <P> There is a tradition in mining communities as old as grief , but layered over with the special stresses of men who go into mines : the dead must have a decent burial ; the bodies must be recovered . Since the 1968 disaster , only five of the bodies have been brought out of the mine ( three of them last week , the first to be found since October 1969 ) , and returned to their families for burial . For the rest , there is division over what should be done . <P> <P> As recovery operations stretched to 15 months-the longest and costliest in mining history-some of the widows sought an end to the strain of wondering " when the phone will ring to say they 've found him . " Worried that their husbands ' bodies had been incinerated in the intense fires of the explosions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stretch over years , they agreed to a plan that would seal off from commercial production the portion of the mine containing the most inaccessible bodies . That area would become a cemetery , and a monument to the miners would be erected on the surface . <P> The plan was originated by The Rev Everett Briggs of St. Stanislaus Catholic Church in Monongah . " They 've been living under a pall of death , " The Rev. Briggs said . " There was this fantasy that widows could n't remarry because their husbands were n't buried . They could n't reorganize their lives . " <P> The proposal was submitted to Consolidation 's officers and quickly approved , with a $10,000 payment going to each of the families . Under the plan , Consolidation could resume commercial operation of the still accessible portion of the mine . An agreement , contingent upon approval of United Mine Workers , the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the West Virginia Department of Mines , was drawn up and signed by 70 widows . <P>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
