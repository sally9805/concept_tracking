The rain falls softly at first , its sound amplified by the trailers ' metal roofs . A child begins to cry . A miner dressed for the second shift steps from the door and trudges toward the creek . The rain continues through the night and he remains there , missing work for a compulsive vigil at the creek bank . Car after car filled with families and belongings rolls from the trailer park in search of higher ground . Those who do not leave listen to the rain and remember . Their tears are the sorrow of Buffalo Creek . A SULLEN GRAY CEILING presses down across Buffalo Creek hollow , from hilltop to hilltop and as far up and down the winding valley as you can see , clamped on like a lid .

There is a brisk , cool wind stirring , unusual here , cleansing but eerie . Mare often the valley is still , clogged with dust kicked up by cars and pickup trucks traveling the crumbling road , and with black grit from the tipples where coal is loaded into boxcars . And , under skies such as these , a fine dulling mist . At this particular hour in midafternoon. the long lines of C &; 0 ears arc full but not moving . The upper end of the seventeen-mile-long valley is a pretty place . Horses are tethered in thick pastures on choice bottom land . The trees are full , riffled by the wind , and the creek is clear . But something is wrong . It is Lou quiet , curiously empty , too clean .

And then it is empty . Where are they , the people ? The people : the old couples sitting on front porches , men tinkering with gaping cars , children scattered among the houses , the young girls walking in pairs , long hair stringing down their backs and hips swaying in tight jeans , the boys in worked-over Chevys and Fords , honking as they roar by , screeching to a stop to yell , " Where y'all goire ?

T IIREE MOUNTAIN STREAMS come together to form Buffalo Creek , and the small town farthest up the hollow was called Three Forks , or sometimes Saunders , as it is on maps outdated by the flood . The houses , formerly owned by a coal company , had been purchased by miners in the late ' 50s for several thousand dollars . Over the years people ? most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siding , rooms , porches , and garages , installed new heating systems and appliances . It was a clean , well-kept corm/ un ity . In 1953 , the state of West Virginia brought under its water pollution control program what people call " black water " ? the discharge from preparation plants where coal is washed before shipping . Seeking the least expensive way to treat the waste water and sludge that until then had gone directly into the nearest stream , coal companies hit on the idea of using mine wastes ? slag . " gob , " or slate ? to build dams , then pumping the " black water " behind them . There the sludge could settle and the water would be clarified as it seeped through . On one side of Middle Fork was an ugly burning gob pile like the hundreds that have sputtered for decades on West Virginia hillsides . the still highly combustible material emitting sulfurous fumes that wither surrounding trees . It was a simple matter for Lorado Mining Company , which had begun dumping gob there in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a dam . By 1966 , the structure was 500 feet thick and twenty feet high , a stinking , smoking hill locked between the mountains . Because the impoundment was filled with sludge , the new owner , Buffalo Mining Company , started a second dam farther up Middle Fork . In October 1966 a large hillside coal-refuse bank in Wales buried the Aherfam schoolhouse , killing 144 children and adults . That December the U.S. Geological Survey dispatched geologist William Davies to examine thirty-eight banks in West Virginia . One was the first dam on Middle Fork , which Davies noted " could be overtopped and breached . " In March 1967 Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall wrote the governor , the state 's Congressional delegation , and county officials , calling attention to hazards in thirty banks . Only the four considered most dangerous , however , were mentioned by name . The darn on Middle Fork was among the remaining twenty-six . Udall pledged continuing observation of mine dumps " for possible critical conditions . " Only a few months later , Davies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams on Middle Fork , flooding yards and causing minor property damage in Saunders . Residents recall a similar break the year before in a slag pile in Proctor Hollow , another offshoot of Buffalo Creek . In 1968 , Governor Hulett Smith 's office received a second letter , this one attacking the darn in no uncertain terms . An elderly Saunders woman named Pearl Woodrum wrote : " Dear Sir , I live 3 miles above Lorado . I 'm writing you about a big dam of water above us . The coal co. has dumped a big pile of slate about 4 or 5 hundred feet high . The water behind it is about 400 feet deep and it is like a river . It is endangering our homes and lives . There are over 20 families here and they own their homes . Please send someone here to see the water and see how dangerous it is . Everytime it rains it scares everyone to death . We are all afraid we will he washed away and drowned . They just keep dumping slate and slush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please let me hear from you at once and please for God 's sake have the dump and water destroyed . Our lives are in danger . " The letter was routinely forwarded to the state 's water pollution control agency and also to the West Virginia Public Service Commission , which is required to license dams for construction after a thorough review of their design . Representatives of each agency looked over the darn with Buffalo Mining Co. vice-president Steve Dasovich . Later , they acknowledged in interagency letters and memoranda that the darn might slip and that the company had never sought the required license . However , the agency officials interpreted the law to mean that no license could be required retroactively . " They told me they 'd been up there and looked at the dam and it was dangerous and they 'd see what they could do about it , " Mrs. Woodrum recalls . " And that was all that come of it . I never did hear of it anymore , and then I had planned to write Governor Arch Moore who succeeded Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too late . " Widowed before the flood , she lives now with her daughter and a small nasty dog in one of 600 emergency trailers provided by the government . Over the years , the Woodrums had left their home a half-dozen times during heavy rains , the last the night before the flood that destroyed it . By 1968 , the pool behind the second dam was full , and work began on a third , again without a state license . ( In testimony Dasovich said he did not know that a license was required.iThe sludge in the second pool served as the new dam 's foundation . Like the first and second dams , it was a loose mixture of shale and low-grade coal , irregularly compacted by a bulldozer . In June 1970 , when the darn was about half its eventual size , Buffalo Mining was sold to the Pittston Co. , the fourth largest coal producer in the United States . A conglomerate concentrated in coal mining and oil distribution , Pittston also owns 80 percent of Brinks , Inc. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , and claims to own more warehouse space than any other company in the world . Among the more notable members of its eleven-man hoard of directors are ex-heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney and former Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton . In 1971 the company was operating seventy-six mines ? the majority in southwestern Virginia , eastern Kentucky , and West Virginia ? through its Clinchfield coal division and ten wholly owned subsidiaries , among them Buffalo Mining Co . In February 1971 , a front portion of the third dam sloughed off . Nevertheless , the company continued to dump refuse , widening and heightening the structure . During that year , a water inspector habitually noted in written reports to the company that the dam lacked an emergency spillway . His warnings had as much effect as the previous letters , reports , and cave-ins . In May 1971 , nine months before the disaster , the U.S. Bureau of Mines promulgated regulations effective July 1 under the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act . " Refuse piles shall not be constructed so as to impede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If failure of a water or silt retaining dam will create a hazard , it shall be of substantial construction and shall be inspected at least once a week . " Inspection , however , was left up to the company , not entrusted to federal personnel , and , in fact , there were no adequate engineering inspections . On Buffalo Creek the dam appeared so massive ? an 80.000-ton dump , 550 feet wide and 480 feet thick ? that no one dreamed it could go : it might overflow , but not crumble like a sand castle , which is what happened to it that Saturday morning . r HAD BEEN RAINING off and on since Thursday , I but the precipitation was n't that unusual : 3.7 inches in three days , which might be expected on an average of every two or three years . February had been a warm month , and there was little snow . Had the flood come earlier , even more people would have died . But most were awake , and many saw the huge wave laboring toward them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly around Saunders and Lundale , had been warned by men who had been up on the dam the night before , watching the water creep to within a foot of the top . They had gone door to door , pleading with friends and neighbors to leave . But there had been other warnings , in other years ; and some people heard only what seemed to be another cry of wolf . Two deputy sheriffs , Max Doty and Otto Mutters , were among those who urged people to get out . They halted their warnings after they met Buffalo Mining 's Steve Dasovich on the road about 6:30 A.M. According to Deputy Doty 's testimony before Governor Arch Moore 's investigative committee , Dasovich , who had just returned from the clam , stated , " Well , Sheriff , you can quit worrying now . We have channeled around this thing and released some of the pressure off of it , and I think it is going to be all right . " Dasovich maintained afterward that he had merely announced plans to ditch around the darn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutters ' testimony before a Senate labor subcommittee . Whatever was said , Mutters was left with the impression that the dam was all right , as were a group of other people on the road who heard Dasovich at about the same time . Had they not been reassured , Mutters told the subcommittee . " I think myself and the other deputy and people there could have got everybody out . " When the darn went , Dasovich himself narrowly escaped . Subsequent engineering studies have shown that during the night the clam became saturated and the particles of gob buoyant as the water climbed up its slope . The dam quite literally turned to slush and began to ooze forward , allowing 132 million gallons of water to surge over the top , mingling with the sludge . The liquid mass swept through the two lower dams , causing explosions in the smoldering bottom one , and crashed down on Saunders , destroying every dwelling . It picked up cars , trees , people , and even homes with whole families clinging to them , calling for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillsides to safety . Careening from side to side through the zigzag valley , the black mass skirted whole communities and leveled others . In the three hours it took the wave to travel the seventeen miles to Man , 125 men , women , and children died ; 1,000 others were injured , 551 homes were demolished and another 936 extensively damaged , leaving 4,000 people homeless . Property damage was estimated at more than $50 million . Only two homeowners , it turned out , carried flood insurance . ( I was then a reporter for the Charleston Gazette , in the state capital . While my colleagues were having no luck finding company officials on the scene , I called the New York headquarters where an executive vice-president remarked that the flood was , " of course , an act of God . " How , I wondered ? He explained : The impoundment " was incapable of holding the water God poured into it . " 1 The homeless survivors were housed temporarily in the Man high school , with the grade school nearby serving as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris looking for bodies . The weather was unseasonably warm , and the stench of death hung in the air . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers moved in construction crews to raze houses damaged beyond saving , bulldozing the remains into huge piles for burning . Thirteen sites were leveled and equipped with water and sewage facilities and electricity to accommodate the emergency trailers ordered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . Interior Secretary Rogers Morton , brother of Pittston director Thruston , issued a press release saying that his department , which includes the Bureau of Mines , lacked the authority " to order the elimination of dangers to public health and safety " posed by coal-refuse piles . The state investigative committee , however , would later conclude : " The U.S. Bureau of Mines indirectly has authority to prevent dams to be constructed from refuse piles . " BOLT A MONTH AFTER THE FLOOD . Pittston , carefully denying liability for flood damages , nonetheless opened up two claims offices and announced plans to settle with survivors . The company assured stockholders that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the company 's consolidated financial position . " It was yet another ordeal for the flood victims . Fur weeks they had queued up at various offices to get emergency loans , housing , unemployment benefits , medical help , welfare assistance . legal advice , and charity . Now they began shuffling from store to store . seeking the receipts that Pittston insisted must accompany each claim . ( One man presented a laboriously acquired list of a dozen lost items . Ile was sent back for proof of the dates of the purchases . For Pittston , immediate settlement had obvious advantages . Dazed by their losses and eager for compensation , many filed claims without a thorough accounting of all that was gone . Unschooled in the law , many did n't place claims for all of their losses , including physical and mental injuries . Totally without resources , most could n't afford the two or three years it would take to sue , did n't trust local lawyers , many of whom work for coal companies , and did n't want to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frequently arduous . It was n't " unusual for people to make three or four trips to the claims office to argue the worth of a house , a living-room suite , a son 's life . On May 2 , as Pittston executives and directors journeyed to Richmond , Virginia . for the annual shareholders ' meeting . forty-five bitter Buffalo Creek survivors boarded a chartered bus to take their grievances about claims handling before the meeting personally . They arrived the next morning , weary and disheveled from the long ride over the mountains , only to confront several off-duty policemen charged with keeping order . Pittston broke precedent to admit newsmen to the meeting , but the band of West Virginians was barred . IOnly the day before , Continental Oil Company , faced with a similar if lesser challenge , had opened its stockholders ' meeting to a delegation of miners and widows concerned with the policies of its subsidiary , Consolidation Coal Company . ) Still , Pittston could n't insulate the meeting from the events at Buffalo Creek . In April , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wide range of social projects . among them the Voter Education project in Atlanta and the National Indian Youth Council in Albuquerque and several in Appalachia , had discovered among its holdings some shares of Pittston stock . As the group from Buffalo Creek waited outside the carpeted boardroom , three Foundation representatives were inside , urging Pittston to deal with specific problems raised by the disaster . Field president Morris Abram explained : " As a participant in the total society , the Foundation does not want to receive income from its investments only to spend the same income in allocating grants to redress the social distress attributable to that business investment . Moreover , the Field Foundation firmly believes that , in the long run , the safety of its investment in Pittston or any other company depends on the compatibility of that company 's operation with the welfare of its workers and the conservation of the environment . " Abram proposed resolutions requiring Pittston to report to stockholders in six weeks on the kinds and amounts of claims and compensation arising out of the Buffalo Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for similar disasters arising from company operations , and to explore alternative mining methods , complete with cost analyses , for disposal of coal wastes . The resolutions were defeated by a vote of 12,000.000 shares to 1,171 . With a half-dozen reporters present , clearly the waiting West Virginians could n't be ignored . After the meeting , Pittston president Nicholas T. Camicia met with a delegation of seven . This time the press was not admitted . Candela , the son of a coal miner , is a short , agreeable man who was raised in McDowell County , one county below Buffalo Creek . During the session with the seven men , Camicia apparently soothed their doubts . One leader murmured , " I 'm satisfied Nick is going to do what he said . We have faith in the company . " To reporters Camicia remarked , " I was born and raised in this Very area . ... These are my people . I assured them that our policy is to make restitution and to expedite the claims as rapidly as possible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received settlements or were dissatisfied with Pittston offers . Miners also resented the loss of six to twelve weeks ' pay while the mines along the creek were closed by flood damage . Employing the only weapon they knew short of violence , 3,000 men staged a week-long strike for back wages , vowing to shut down all of the company 's mining subsidiaries . Failing , they returned to work poorer for the protest . S INCE FEBRUARY 26 , 1972 , Pittston executives have maintained a distinctly low profile except for a flurry of appearances before state and Congressional investigating committees where , for the most part , they were treated courteously , even gingerly . But at a hearing last May , while Camicia was on the stand , New Jersey 's Harrison Williams . Jr. , chairman of a Senate labor subcommittee , pointedly observed that Pittston had been cited 5,000 times for alleged violations ( carrying possible penalties of $1.1 million ) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act ? more than any other company . " I was not aware of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , he believed certain of the citations were either not justified or excessive , and thus were being appealed . In a subsequent letter Camicia explained additionally that the appeals were being filed in order to test the constitutionality of the Safety Act . At the hearing before the state investigative committee , Camicia essentially argued the position that Pittston adopted shortly after the flood , that the disaster " was not foreseen and was not reasonably foreseeable . " But , identifying Francis J. Palamara as the source of the " act of God " quote , he observed . " I would never call it an act of God .... Certainly I 'm not blaming God for it . " With the deity absolved , Camicia further maintained that the impoundment was n't a dam . " It was a slag heap used for filtration of water from a cleaning plant . " Finally , he begged for " some help and not a lot of rules and regulations that wo n't do us any good , as we now have . " The governor 's committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pittston Company , through its officials , has shown flagrant disregard for the safety of residents of Buffalo Creek and other persons who live near coal-refuse impoundments . This attitude appears to be prevalent throughout much of the coal industry . " Camicia now turns aside interview requests . He explains that his lawyers have advised him to keep silent about a $52 million lawsuit brought by nearly 500 families and individuals . He calls the suit " a nuisance " that will " take a lot of my time . " ( In response to my own request for an interview , Camicia suggested that a written list of questions be submitted through Pittston 's public relations firm , Albert Frank-Guenther Law of New York . This was done , and the immediate response was a telephone call from a man named Gilbert Busch , who described himself as a " special public relations consultant . " Busch asked for a copy of a draft of this article to provide " a frame of reference . " Turned down , he declined to answer questions that involved , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lost production , claims settlements , flood damage , and lawyers ' fees , as well as what action Pittston has taken to eliminate its other slag dams . ) The Pittston hoard of directors seems preoccupied with the company 's economic prospects . Quite apart from the flood , 1972 was a bad year : by October , net income was only $18.2 million , compared with $34.9 million for the same period in 1971 . Camicia and board chairman Joseph Routh blame surface ( strip ) mining restrictions and costly health and safety regulations , not the Buffalo Creek claims against which the company is insured . Still , some of the directors display a startling viewpoint toward the Buffalo Creek disaster . Samuel Pryor of Greenwich , Connecticut , a for- ! i mer Pan Am vice-president , observed that Pittston was no more responsible for the Buffalo Creek flood than the one last summer in Scranton , Pennsylvania . " It was an act of nature .... The rains came and the dam would n't take it . " Vigorous despite his seventy-two years ? at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was built by the government and inspected and inspected and inspected . " To the incredulous response , " By the government ? Buffalo Mining Co. built the dam , " Pryor replied , " Just read the reports . Do n't be satisfied with what the minority say . " Thruston Morton , the affable ex-Senator and former GOP national chairman , sighs : " It was a terrible tragedy , of course . No question about it . Well , it happened to us in 1937 in Louisville . .. " " A dam broke ? " " No , forty days and forty nights of rain . " " But it only rained three days on Buffalo Creek . " " No , no . Check your weather . " There is a grain of truth in Morton 's statement . In January and February , rainfall averaged 2.5 inches above normal , leaving the ground saturated . But , in the words of West Virginia state climatologist Robert Weedfall , " If there 'd been no dam , there 'd have been no flood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dozens of slag dams in southern West Virginia , including others on Buffalo Creek , the only one to fail during the rainstorm belonged to Pittston Co . A FINAL DRIVE through the valley , today under sunny skies . There 's a chill in the air and the same eerie wind persists . At the head of the creek the remains of the first gob pile are sliced by a V-shaped gash where the water surged through . One hundred thirty-two million gallons of liquid failed to extinguish the internal fires , and flames still lick at its slope . Several hundred yards away , a clamshell is scooping the cleaning-plant sludge from the new , shallow settling pond . Trucks haul it away to a distant hollow . The system is a substitute for the dams ? no less unsightly . but one that at least poses no threat to human life . For a brief time , there was anger on Buffalo Creek . Now you find only depression and uncertainty . Not surprisingly , Dr. Albert Redo , a psychiatrist with the county mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delusion of fear every time it begins to rain , especially in the children . " There are also guilt feelings among those who lived while so many died . Cases of extreme headaches , body aches , and hypochondria are common . A dozen elderly people , in whom the symptoms constituted acute neurosis , have been sent to a state mental hospital . Recio , a Cuban refugee not unacquainted with dislocation , is nonetheless surprised that " amazingly enough , they all want togo back to the same place . " To their gardens , their land , their neighbors . The doctor believes it would be the best thing for them now . But no one can begin rebuilding until water and sewage facilities are installed , and work has barely begun . It was held up for months by controversy over plans for a highway through the hollow and into the next county , plans formulated ten years ago and dusted off when the flood made possible 100 percent federal disaster funding .

So , now , months after the flood on Buffalo Creek , there is only grass . K ENNY OSBORNE , thirty-six , sits uncomfortably in the easy chair that came with his three-bedroom mobile home in " Green Valley , " a trailer site on Huff Creek a mile from Man . He has spent the day in bed , his back laced with pain from an injury in the mines last year . Periodically he draws workmen 's compensation , then returns to the mines when the pain eases , refusing to do the light work ordered by the doctor because " I ai n't going to ask no boss to let me go outside and work .

For the house , furniture , clothing , a car , and a jeep , and nineteen stands of bees , he received from Pittston ? and he tells you to the penny-813,588.76 . He now calculates a true loss of $27,000 , but in the haste to file he forgot much of what he lost . " I just asked for $16,000 . " Unlike some , " I tried to be honest about it .
