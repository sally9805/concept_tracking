txt More than $6 million in federal funds could be lost because of the apparent financial mismanagement of two Chicago projects in which 700 low income apartments were rehabilitated , federal officials have told THE TRIBUNE . A third project , the 549-unit Woodlawn Gardens on the South Side , is in jeopardy , and the $9.3 million federal investment for this building project may also be lost because of serious questions raised by the Federal Housing Administration about the project 's financial management over the last year , officials indicated . Managed by Foundation All three projects were directed by officials of the multimillion-dollar Kate Maremont Foundation , using special provisions of the National Housing Act which permit the use of FHA 100 per cent guaranteed loans . Projects coordinator was Victor de Grazia , former executive vice president of the foundation , president of the Chicago Rehabilitation Management Foundation , which managed the projects financially , and also campaign manager for Daniel Walker , an independent seeking the Democratic Party nomination for governor . Walker was not implicated in any way .

For example , it was found that administrative fees , including an unexplained management fee , ran as high as 24 per cent  --  the single greatest expense in running a North Side building for a year . FHA permits only a 5 per cent administrative fee . THE TRIBUNE also was informed that a top level Chicago FHA official is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for suspect deals that occurred at the same time the Maremont Foundation projects were approved . The Chicago FHA office has been under Director John L. Waner only since October . The Maremont Foundation set up a not-for-profit management corporation and allied itself with several community groups for some projects in order to qualify for the special low income housing programs . The projects were supposed to be a charitable contribution from Arnold H. Maremont , socially prominent Chicago industrialist , who established the foundation .

The problem may be an unexpected rise in property taxes , but FHA says it has ' had trouble getting its full accounting of the project from Maremont management employes despite repeated requests . If the project goes under , it would mean that the nation 's largest private low income housing project was a dismal I failure . It could frighten builders and bring the end of privately developed low income housing projects , a FHA official said . ' The two rehabilitation projects , one consisting of 13 buildings scattered t hruout the North Side and another with six buildings in the Lawndale District on the West Side , failed for reasons that are still somewhat unclear to the FHA . Most of the buildings are expected to be taken over soon by the FHA .

One former FHA administrator , who was put under heavy pressure because he disapproved of the Maremont projects , said : " I refused to sign any of the commitments for those projects because I knew what was going on and I felt that some day there would be a there Investigation . I did n't want my name involver wife mem . " Many of the projects were destined for failure from the beginning , I thought , and so did others around me , but we could n't stop them . There were flagrant violations of the rules and regulations and the hopes of the poor , " he said . " I thought it was all a gimmick . These are strong charges , but I can back them up .

THE TRIBUNE was told that , despite the continuous failures , the Maremont interests were always granted 100 per cent FHA mortgage guarantees even tho no one waited to see whether this corporation , new to the building industry , was capable of success . Refused Local Control Chicago FHA officials also say they were often unable to exert any control over the Maremont projects because their orders and demands were often countermanded by highranking Washington FHA administrators . All of the projects were arranged in Washington between 1963 and 1968 and not thru the local FHA office , as is the usual procedure . During that time , the FHA was under control of Democratic Party appointees . Maremont was appointed chairman of the old Public Aid Commission and served until a rift with then Gov . Otto Kerner . De Grazia , who had been Kerner 's director of economic development , left the Kerner administration to go with Maremont . The first Chicago project was the 13-building one . These buildings became ready for occupancy between 1965 and 1968 . They are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1972 and the mortgages , too . Michael Maremont said these buildings got into trouble because of increased property taxes and maintenance costs not included in the early projections . Figures Withheld However , the FHA said the high administrative costs , averaging 17 per cent , and sometimes as high as 24 per cent for one building , were " exorbitant " and in violation of standard FHA allotments . In addition , FHA officials said they were unable to learn the exact cause of the project 's failure because they could never get a proper financial audit from the foundation , as required by FHA . One Is Joint Venture The second rehabilitation project on the West Side was a joint venture of the foundation and the Lawndale Freedom Movement , a community group . Three buildings were refurbished , one burned , and two are under Housing Court demolition decrees  --  yet more than $600,000 was spent . The foundation and the community group began quarreling , De Grazia said , and the Me ? tion led to harassment of the , construction workers and resistance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would not leave the buildings , delaying t h e project for months , he said . Michael Maremont said the real problem came when the rehabilitation allotment ran out and the community group refused to ask the FHA for more money to complete the job . Many subcontractors on the job have not been paid , altho some bills are two years old . There was a completion bond for the project , but FHA officials do not know why this was not enforced to complete the work . The community group charged that the construction costs were inflated and caused the project to fail . An FHA audit in 1970 showed sloppy accounting procedures wer e used for the construction funds . FHA officials have not given a specific reason for the failure and want a full accounting of all expenses before making a decision . " The reports were always delayed six or seven months , and even then there was no certification by the auditor .
