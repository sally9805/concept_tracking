txt The pattern of adoptions In the United States Is changing so fast that new national guidelines are needed . This is agreed by most experts in the field contacted for a current Monitor series , and the experts spotlight two areas as needing the most urgent attention : ? Federal help in finding homes for more than 100,000 youngsters now considered unadoptable because of age , race , or physical or mental handicaps . ? Early clarification of a 1972 Supreme Court ruling requiring thatunmarried fathers be given some voice in the fate of their children . The ruling ( Stanley v. Illinois ) is affecting adoption procedures In every state . Up to now , adoption problems that have Involved more than one Jurisdiction have been solved through Interstate agreements or individual court rulings . Many states have resisted federal legislation , fearing that uniform adoption practices might In some way hinder state operations . However , there is growing feeling that the broad interests of children would best be served by federal action . // *Child adoption : federal guidelines needed // Before the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D ) of California . The " opportunities for adoption act of 1974 " would , among other things ( 1 ) establish a national office of adoption information within the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare ; and ( 2 ) set up national guidelines to eliminate legal and jurisdictional adoption obstacles between the states . The bill would also encourage states to undertake adoption subsidy programs ? specifically to increase the number of placements of minority and so-called hard-to-place youngsters in permanent homes . This legislation , which is generally supported by child welfare officials and family court judges , has been referred to a subcommittee on children and youth ( of the Senate 's Labor and public Wc I fare Committee ; for hearings Interpretations differ As to the Stanley ruling that affords legal standing to putative or unwed fathers , state adoption officials see It as a source of confusion and concern . States have been forced to draw up guidelines regarding the rights of natural fathers , yet there Is widespread difference of opinion regarding what the Stanley case really means On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring that consent of a natural father must In all circumstances be obtained before a child may be placed for adoption Previously , agencies and courts only sought the legal release of the natural mother . On the other hand , officials of other states frankly admit that they generally circumvent the Stanley ruling by giving token notice of birth . This forces the putative father to take the initiative and come forth ? if he has an interest in the child . It also , by inference , places fiscal " responsibility " on him Compromise sought Many states ? among them Iowa , Wisconsin , Michigan , Illinois , New York , and California ? are working toward compromise solutions . Michigan , for example , has developed a prenatal " registration " system under which a natural father must file a statement of " interest " in a particular birth . Other states , including California , lean toward the " registration " system . But observers say this still could leave unanswered problems , such as how to notify the father who is unaware of his paternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to placement of a child . Some , such as Illinois , allow him 30 days to answer such notice . But here again , some adoption officials point out , there are serious drawbacks . Many unmarried mothers are extremely reluctant to name the father . Others say embarrassment and stigma are attached to such publication . Petitions are rare Although adoption officials say there are instances of natural fathers admitting paternity and legal responsibility ? and even rare occurrences where they petition for custody ? It is not widespread Lawyers , some of whom say the rights of natural fathers should be constitutionally considered , nonetheless generally hold that the Stanley case is a poor legal yardstick . In this situation , a common-law husband , who had fathered three Illegitimate children during an 18- year relationship with their mother , was deprived of their custody when she passed away . Under Illinois law , the youngsters were made wards of the court . In striking down this state statute , the U.S. Supreme Court held that the failure of a state to grant the father a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due process and the equal protection clauses of the Constitution .
