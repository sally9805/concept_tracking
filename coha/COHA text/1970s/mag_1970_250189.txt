The packers make money out of everything but the pig 's squeal . <P> - Old Stockyards Saying <P> When Ling-Temco-Vought took over Chicago 's Wilson &; Co. in 1967 , James J. Ling showed the finesse of a butcher slicing a juicy porterhouse . He carved the company into three parts-meat packing , sporting goods and drugs-and sold pieces of each part to the public . The three parts , and their stocks , were quickly nicknamed " meatball , " " golf ball " and " goofball . " Now Ling is cutting his meatball into hamburger . Five companies will be chopped out of Wilson 's meat operations : Wilson Certified Foods , Wilson Beef &; Lamb , Wilson Laurel Farms , Wilson-Sinclair and Wilson Agri-Business Enterprises . <P> Until this week , Wilson meat stockholders could either retain their shares in the parent company or exchange them for a complex package of cash and stock in each of the first four new companies ; the fifth will be wholly owned by Wilson &; Co . If shareholders accept this offer . Jim Ling will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase his holdings in the parent Wilson company from 82% to 90% . <P> The split-up is supposed to provide " flexibility for growth , " but , most important , it will provide financially pressed Jim Ling with another means of raising cash . Ling , who needs millions this year to pay off loans and to service his debt , can sell off or borrow against the subdivided parts of Wilson meat more easily than the whole company . He may well be in a selling mood at a time when LTV stock is down to only 40% of its price two years ago and other LTV holdings are also depressed . Until recently , LTV officials had been negotiating to sell the company 's 55% interest in Braniff Airways to Norton Simon Inc. , but they ended the talks , presumably because terms could not be agreed upon .
