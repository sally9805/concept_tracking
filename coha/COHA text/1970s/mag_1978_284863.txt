France 's leading anchor out-Cronkites Cronkite <P> One evening a few years ago , several agents of the French government slipped unobtrusively into the U.S. on one of the most daring assignments in the annals of international skulduggery . They checked into a midtown Manhattan hotel , spent much of the next few days watching the CBS Evening News in their rooms , and then fled the country as quietly as they had come , their mission accomplished . The mission ? Figurez vous ! To capture Walter Cronkite . <P> Not in the flesh , of course . But in spirit , nuance , mannerism , inflection and any other ephemeral component of credibility that might explain the graying CBS anchorman 's enormous popularity . A faction in the state television monopoly wanted to replace the reigning crew of bland newsreaders with a single , reassuringly credible , American-style anchorman-en effet , a French Walter Cronkite . In 1974 French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing made that scheme possible by splitting the monopoly into three parts . Officials of Tlvision Franaise I , one of the new state-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a suitable anchor , so they took a long shot : Roger Gicquel , a relatively obscure former airline steward , failed actor and radio-station executive who had never been in front of a TV camera . <P> For the first six months on the job , Gicquel recalls , he was only an actor playing the role of anchorman . " I must have seemed a bit awkward , " he admits , " like I was wearing my Sunday suit . " But , " little by little , I began to understand that it was necessary only to be like I really was . " Much of Gicquel 's appeal seems to lie in a kind of Gallic avuncular gloom , and an ability to register an appropriate flicker of sorrow , anger , levity or weariness in reaction to whatever news he is reading-the same reactions that viewers presumably are having . As Gicquel puts it , " I try to consider myself the recipient of the news just as the public will be , and to re-create before the public my reaction as I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carnal , physical style of communication than an analysis in words . " According to the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur , Gicquel , " carrying the burden of all the distress , loneliness and violence , grimaces painfully over all the international tensions and unemployment . " <P> Whatever the source of his chagrin , Gicquel was soon out-Cronkiting Cronkite . The somber , chain-smoking Frenchman has brought an unprecedented measure of subtle and sometimes anti-government editorializing to French TV news-to the chagrin of about 75 viewers each week who write him to protest . He delivers himself of stronger opinions off-camera . Last year he produced a serious book about the impact of TV on French society . Called Violence and Fear , it has become a bestseller.
