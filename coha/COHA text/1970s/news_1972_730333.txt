txt Progress , as city planners define it , was about to make itself manifest on Chicago 's lakefront south of the Loop when Mayor Daley suddenly blew the whistle and temporarily called a , halt to the Whole thing . Responding to the public 's emotional concern about the fate of the Lake Michigan shoreline , the Mayor on May 10 disavowed any intentions by the city to build an airport on the lake . Special Aide Intervenes " It is time we eliminate the emotionalism and controversy about this issue , " Daley said . " The facts are that with the expansion of O'Hare Field and the full utilization of Midway , there is no need for a third major airport , " On the same day , the Mayor announced the appointment of Louis B. Wetmore , a professor of planning at the University of Illinois , as his special assistant to update the Chicago plan for Lake Michigan shoreline , development , The latter move tossed a monkey wrench , at least temporarily , into plans by the city and Illinois Central Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air rights between 11th Place and 31st Street along the lake . Preparation of the plans and guidelines  --  designed to transform 172 acres of railroad yards into a complex of low and high-rise office and apartment buildings  --  were ordered " held up " by the Mayor until Wetmore and the newly formed Lakefront Policy Committee complete their study . They 're expected to present their comprehensive development plan to Daley in August . Project to be Massive Officially known as the Illinois Central Air Rights Development South , the project south of Grant Park could become the largest real-estate enterprise in the city , surpassing the 511/4-billion I. C. development rising on 83 acres east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and the Chicago River . The raw market value of an acre of land in the proposed development ranges from $500,000 to $1.5 million , The development may well become one of the most controversial . Criticism already abounds , oven tho the city has yet to release its guidelines for the project . Except for the 640-room , 25 story McCormick Inn convention hotel , under construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 600-loot wide strip of I.

Critics Assail " Minicity " Critics of the proposed development object to it on the same grounds they oppose the I. C. development north of Randolph Street . Among their complaints is that the land will turn into a high-rise city within a city , open only to those who can afford it . They fear that Chicagoans will be cut off from their lakefront by a solid wall of buildings stretching from the Chicago River to McCormick Place . The development will generate so much traffic , they say , that thorofares like Lake Shore Drive will no longer function as public ways . Idealists among them want to see the whole site developed into a park . The Illinois Central Railroad acquired the property in 1852 from the city in return for creating a landfill along Michigan Avenue , Legal efforts by the city in 1965 to obtain title to the air rights over the land , failed .

C. Industries . Four Areas Are Charted For purposes of development , the 172 acres have been divided into four subdevelopment area , The Tribune learned . First to be developed will be the area from 11th Place to 14th Street . Because it is the closest area to the Loop , it will be the most densely developed of the four zones , Jensen said . Nine to 10 buildings are contemplated for the area , including four million square feet of office space in three or four buildings , and a 1,200-room hotel with the balance being apartment structures . One office building will be the new headquarters for I. C. Industries , currently in the old I , C. terminal building on 11th Place . The proposed new L C. terminal probably will be located underneath one of the new office buildings , Jensen said . At the present time , no construction is contemplated north of Roosevelt Road , he said , Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I , C. land stretching south of the Stevenson Expressway to 31st Street . Building construction in the area will be primarily residential and Institutional , along with some commercial development to support the area 's residential fabric . Development in the area , which may include a 500-room hotel-motel complex at 31st Street , will complement Michael Reese Hospital 's plans to expand its outpatient treatment facilities , Jensen said . He forsees , for example , much of the 500,000 to one-million square feet of office space in the area occupied by doctors . Height of the buildings will be about 15 to 20 stories , Next would be the area from 20th to 25th Streets , The density of buildings here , altho not as great as In the subdevelopment between 11th Place and 14th Street , will be greater than in the zones south and north of the area , Jensen said .

Altho I long-range plans mark this site primarily for housing , the exact use of the land and the number and types of buildings has yet to be determined , Jensen said . Periodically , the site has been suggested as a possible location for anew stadium complex replacing Soldier Field , 3 . C. Industries , parent company of the I. C. railroad , will be involved in one way or another in all of the subdevelopments . C. Industries and Ogden Development Corp. , a New York-based industrial ? management firm , will jointly develop the area between 11th Place and 14th Street , Martin Gecht and Eugene Heytow of Aristocrat Inns of America and Arthur Knelber , of Bacon Whipple &; Co , , are the developers of the $30-million McCormick Inn across Lake Shore Drive from McCormick Place , The hotel developers have long-range plans for developing a total of 12 acres across from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and office buildings . As development of the entire 172 acres progresses , other developers undoubtedly will participate . Still to be decided is how much the developers and how much the city will pay for the cost of street , sewer , and water system construction , as well as how much land required for street construction will be donated to the city , by the railroad . ? Of the 172:acres involved , less than 25 per cent will be used for buildings , Jensen said . Two-thirds of the developed land will be for housing . The structures will be about 30 stories high , except for one or two buildings that might go as high as 50 stories , Jensen said . The office buildings are expected to be located in the west end of the ? development area and the residential structures near the lake .
