THE IDES OF AUGUST by Curtis Cate ; Evans ; 534 pages ; $15 <P> The villain of a book is seldom an inanimate object . But in this case , the Berlin Wall qualifies for the role . If Curtis Cate 's richly detailed , gripping history has a villain , however , it lacks a hero . For the author , a longtime commentator on European affairs and a biographer of George Sand and Antoine de Saint-Exupry , strongly implies that the Wall would never have been built if the Western Allies had shown a little more sophistication and a little less fear . <P> The Ides of August is a kind of upstairs-downstairs drama . On the upper level , in full view , are the national leaders fitfully attempting to deal with the crisis of 1961 . Obscured from public sight are the embattled East Berliners making a last attempt to escape before the Wall is completed . The contrast is sometimes too theatrical and may do less than justice to statesmen who must always improvise , but Cate sharply points up the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> He includes many poignant vignettes of Germans running , swimming , crawling to freedom or to death . Construction Worker Emil Goltz darts under a railway car , hanging between the wheels for miles . Two lovers appear to be ardently embracing by the Wall , but under cover of the clinch , the man is hastily snipping the wire . When the gap is large enough , the lovers rush through followed by a group of friends who were hiding near by . Others , in scenes reminiscent of The Spy Who Came In from the Cold , perish within a few feet of the West , or are arrested and imprisoned because they seek to be reunited with their families . <P> The story of the Wall has been told before , but not with such cold fury . Cate paints an unflattering picture of President <P> John F. Kennedy and his advisers . They were , he claims , intimidated by Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev , who had been making grim references to a nuclear holocaust if the West did not get out of Berlin , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beneath the bluster , however , Khrushchev was behaving cautiously . At first , he resisted East German Party Boss Walter Ulbricht 's request to build the Wall . When the barrier was erected , Western leaders reacted with relief . They had been expecting much worse . <P> They maintained an air of indifference , acting as though the crisis might go away if they ignored it . " When I go to bed at night , I try not to think about Berlin , " confessed Secretary of State Dean Rusk . A few Administration officials dissented . <P> They warned that letting Khrushchev get away with the Wall would only encourage further Soviet adventurism . James O'Donnell , who worked in the State Department 's economic division , exploded at a meeting : " You and your crowd of mandarin idiots are trying to put a fourth color into the American flag ! "
