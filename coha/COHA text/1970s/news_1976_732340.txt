txt President Ford scooped his own budget Monday night , by revealing , ahead of time plans to spend $394.2 billion in fiscal 1977 while reducing the federal government 's role in paying for the health care , education , and school lunches of Americans . In his State of the Union Message , the President only touched on details of the budget he 'll send to Congress Wednesday , but a separate White House fact sheet disclosed most of the details , with the exception of defense expenditures . Ford 's new budget will call for an increase of $21 billion in spending over fiscal 1976 , with a deficit of $43 billion ? $33 billion less than the current financial year . HE AGAIN renewed his call for a $10 billion cut in federal income taxes , buthe also urged a 0.3 per cent increase in Social Security taxes effective Jan. 1 , 1977 , to restore the federal pension system to financial stability . In a move that may provoke widespread criticism , Ford proposed consolidating 59 federal social programs into 4. major " block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and aid for the blind and disabled . The funds would flow to the states without any requirement that they be matched with state money , as under current law . States could reduce the amount of money they now spend for these programs . FORD PROPOSED putting the Medicaid program into the health-care block grant scheme , which would result in $10 billion going to the states in fiscal 1977 . That means for the first time a ceiling would be put on Medicaid , now an open-ended program . The child nutrition plan would consolidate all the school-lunch programs , with federal spending of $2.2 billion-4600 million less than in fiscal 1976 . If Ford has his way , only children from families living in official poverty about $4,000 a year for a family of four would be eligible for federal subsidies for school lunches . The resclt would be that the price of school lunches would go up for most children , except those living below the poverty line . THE PRESIDENT proposed spending S2.5 billion as a block grant to the states for social services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant to the states . He also asked for sweeping new revisions in the federal Medicare program , including a plan that would force the elderly to share more of the costs of hospitalization and physician care . But the President put a maximum on these charges , saying it would provide the aged protection against catastrophic illnesses for the first time . An elderly person would have to pay for the first day of a hospital stay and 10 per cent of additional charges up to an annual maximum of $500 . FOR DOCTOR 'S care . an elderly person would have to pay the first $77 bill annually , plus 20 per cent of doctor 's bill up to a maximum $250 . Ford 's budget would limit hospitals ' to a 7 per cent increase in costs and physicians to a 4 per cent increase in fees under the Medicare program . If hospitals and doctors charged more than this , the elderly person would have to pick up the extra cost . If Ford 's Medicare proposals are adopted , federal spending for fiscal 1977 will decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn in a solid performance in calendar 1976 , growing by an estimated 6.2 per cent , followed by 5.7 per cent growth in 1977 . He predicted the rate of inflation will decline to 5.9 per cent . RENEWING HIS call for a $28 billion tax cut ? $10 billion more than the one now in effect  --  Ford also proposed three other tax revisions he said would help spur employment , but by bow much , he did n't say . One revision , costing the Treasury an estimated $300 million in fiscal 1977 , calls for increased tax writeoffs for plants and equipment expansion or construction in high unemployment areas . In order to qualify for the tax break , the facility must be in an area with average unemployment over 7 per cent . Chicago ' is in that category . The construction must begin within one year in order to be eligible for the faster tax writeoff for depreciation . A building with-a 30-year useful life would be eligible for a 33 per cent depreciation tax writeoff within five years , against today 's 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even greater break , with the entire cost eligible for tax writeoff over five years , against 69 per cent now . The result , according to Ford , would be a new incentive for the construction industry to start building  --  something they have n't been doing because , of the recession , high interest rates , and inflation . Ford also proposed a plan to broaden stock ownership by low- and middle-income Americans by allowing them to delay paying their taxes on invested funds until they withdraw them . But the money would have to be kept in the stock market for seven years . THE STOCK ownership plan is similar to other Ford proposals previously sent to congress . which were designed to foster savings by Americans and increase the amount of capital that businesses have to invest . Ford 's budget repeated his calls to cut the corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 per cent , to eliminate the double taxation of dividends , and to stimulate the construction of electric utilities . He also proposed a new plan of tax relief for financial institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed housing industry .
