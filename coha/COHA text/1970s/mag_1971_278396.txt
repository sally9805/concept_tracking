Queen Elizabeth II surprised Parliament last May by sending a " gracious message " to Westminster asking for a raise in her allowance . In an age when most of her subjects take an annual wage increase for granted , the Queen was struggling to run the royal household on a budget of $1,187,500 that had not been increased since she succeeded to the throne in 1952 . During that time , wages in Britain had increased 126% and prices by 74% ; last year , expenditures for the royal household exceeded the allowance by $675,000. which Her Majesty had to make up from other sources of income . <P> Financial Plight . In response to the plea , Commons established a select committee , headed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber , to examine the royal family 's financial plight . Its report provided Britons with a rare glimpse of budgetary problems at Buckingham Palace . Since 1952 , the Queen 's food costs have risen from $72,175 a year to $110,000 , upkeep of the royal carriage horses from $11,103 to $28,770 , and newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising costs , the Queen has dropped 70 people from her domestic staff , leaving only 46 to run Buckingham Palace . The job of winding and cleaning palace clocks has been contracted to a private firm . Even the royal gardens are now expected to pay their way ; in a good year , sale of their flowers , mushrooms and vegetables returns a small profit . <P> Last week , following a brisk debate on the costs and benefits of the monarchy , the Commons voted 300 to 27 to raise the Queen 's allowance by 106% , to $2,450,000 . That cleared the way for a less controversial government proposal-to increase M.P.s ' pay by a relatively modest 38% , to $11,250 a year , a measure that is expected to pass easily this week . <P> What galled some opposition M.P.s about the raise was that the Queen 's allowance , which is paid from the " civil list " and is intended to defray her official expenditures , represents only a small portion of her total income , none of which is taxed . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " privy purse , " about $750,000 a year in revenues from the Duchy of Lancaster , lands that Henry III seized from two rebellious barons in 1265 . This revenue pays for the Queen 's personal expenditures as head of state , including clothing ( about $75,000 worth a year ) and upkeep of Sandringham and Balmoral castles , which she owns outright . <P> Furthermore , various government departments spend $7,500,000 yearly on such queenly perquisites as the royal yacht ( $2,097,500 ) , air travel ( $1,750,000 ) and stationery ( $115,000 ) . Beyond that , the Queen-clearly one of the world 's wealthiest women-has a vast inherited private income .
