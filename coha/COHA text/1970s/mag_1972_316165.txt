The movies ' legendary comic genius was playing his greatest reconciliation scene . Charlie Chaplin and America were kissing and making up-and loving every minute of it . <P> Charlie was edgy on the plane from Bermuda , where he had been resting for a few days before setting foot in the U.S. for the first time in 20 years . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had invited him to receive a special award at Hollywood 's Oscar ceremonies , and the Film Society of New York City 's Lincoln Center was throwing a big party for him at Philharmonic Hall . But what about the audiences ? Would they respond again to the comic humanity of his Little Tramp ? Would they resurrect the old resentments at the leftish leanings and marital tangles that had led Attorney General James P. McGranery in 1952 to order him detained if he tried to re-enter the U.S. ? Or would they merely show indifference at the appearance of another octogenarian has-been ? <P> <P> The reception at Kennedy Airport was not particularly promising . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transients at the terminal windows watched the fleshy-faced , white-haired old man , just short of 83 , blow a few kisses for the cameras , then ease himself slowly down the airplane steps and shuffle over to a waiting limousine . <P> That evening New York 's welcome began to warm up . Gloria Vanderbiit Cooper , who has known Charlie 's wife Oona since they were both 14 ( and who also once married a famous oldster , Conductor Leopold Stokowski ) , gave a dinner party for the Chaplins in her town house and invited 66 of the Manhattanites who matter . Among them were Theatricals ( like perennial Film Star Lillian Gish ) , Actresses ( Geraldine Fitzgerald and Kitty Carlisle ) , Politicals ( Senator and Mrs. Jacob Javits ) , and Literary-Socials ( Truman Capote and George Plimpton ) . Winsomely self-deprecating , perched on his chair rather than sitting in it , the guest of honor basked in so much high-powered appreciation-humming delightedly along with Showman Adolph Green 's near total recall of the themes from Chaplin 's film scores . It was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nervous again about the public reception that awaited him at Lincoln Center ; he was too tense to attend a preliminary screening of two 1921 Chaplin films : The Idle Class and The Kid . At a cocktail party for about 50 notables at a suite in his hotel , Charlie and Oona came late , sat down , and limited their conversation pretty much to how-do-you-dos . <P> <P> Charlie need not have worried . At Philharmonic Hall , the 1,500 who had paid $10 and $25 admission , plus the 1,200 who had paid $100 and $250 apiece for a black-tie champagne reception after the films , cheered him to the echo when he appeared with Oona in the first tier , and they watched the Little Tramp on-screen with such delighted empathy that the big concert hall all but glowed in the dark . When the movies were over , the audience turned in sudden , shouting ovation toward the dignified old man looking down on them , whose spry shadow had just been cavorting on the screen . <P> Norman Mailer had tears in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
