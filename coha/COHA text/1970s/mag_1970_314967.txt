LETTER TO THE ALUMNI by John Hersey. 145 pages . Knopf. $4.95 . <P> Author-Reporter John Hersey ( A Bell for Adano , Hiroshima , The Algiers Motel Incident ) got out of Yale with the class of 1936 . The subject of his book is Yale during last spring 's May Day demonstrations , when undergraduates supported eight Black Panthers accused of murder , kidnaping or conspiracy in New Haven . Hersey was no blimpish Old Blue come back for the weekend to gnash his teeth . <P> Five years ago , Yale President Kingman Brewster invited Hersey to join the Yale staff as a sort of nonprofessorial gadfly-in-residence . He accepted and became " master " of Pierson College . He watched sympathetically as national events and the evolving youthful counterculture led Yale to the brink of what he regretfully came to call " confrontational hysteria . " <P> Letter is addressed to Hersey 's fellow alumni , whom he upbraids for the " disturbing . . . gap in understanding between you and your Blue Mother . " Upon a clear and reasonable narrative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneven but perceptive observations about young people . He finds them thirsty for moral leadership , not totally liberated about sex , " hyper-energetic , " and capable of astonishing maturity when given enough trust . <P> The book 's most interesting parts are insider 's reports . One reason that a tense faculty voted to make academic work voluntary during the crisis weekend was the startling speech of Kurt Schmoke , the normally fire-breathing black secretary of the senior class . Instead of spouting abusive rhetoric , Schmoke spoke " only five or six brief sentences , to this effect : The students on this campus are confused , they 're frightened . They do n't know what to think . You are older than we are , and more experienced . We want guidance from you , moral leadership . On behalf of my fellow students , I beg you to give it to us . ' " <P> Hersey is at his best in his human vignettes , as when he describes Mike , a dedicated radical , during an intramural baseball game , " running to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds , beard flying in the April wind , an outsized cap cupping his flowing hair-and then the thud of the ball in his glove and the companionable cheers of men who did n't agree with Mike on one damn thing . " <P> After the flood of " **36;2344;TOOLONG " memoirs , Mersey 's common humanity is a welcome relief . Christopher T. Cory
