The toy shelves of any large department store these days are stacked high with tactical games of war , sports and business , all with complex rules designed to reduce the element of chance and create opportunities for individual strategy . The latest additions to the list are three new political games with definite election-year appeal . In some ways , their verisimilitude to the realities of real life politics is downright cynical . The best candidate is not always the winner ; sometimes it is the candidate with the most money . <P> WHO CAN BEAT NIXON ? ( Harrison-Blaine ; $7 ) bears a certain resemblance to that perennial family favorite , Monopoly . Up to seven players choose the names of real candidates , including McGovern , Muskie and Lindsay , and set out to defeat another player , who is Nixon . They throw dice to advance their candidates around the board from Alaska to Florida in pursuit of electoral votes , which are won with money and something called media points . Although the game is deliberately weighted in Nixon 's favor - he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others-the contest can be equalized if he lands on a square that requires him to draw special cards , one of which might send him to the laryngitis ward , similar to Monopoly 's jail . Other cards may trigger Cabinet shakeups or a kickback scandal . Play continues until one candidate collects 270 electoral votes . MR . PRESIDENT ( 3M Co. ; $8.95 ) is a game for two to four players who campaign for popular or electoral votes . According to the directions , each party fields a candidate for President and Vice President and " attempts to win the election by campaigning , advertising and debating throughout the nation . " Fictitious names are used . For example , a player might choose Republican Hoyt ( " Red " ) Meredith , a New Hampshire Senator , to run for President against Georgia 's Democratic Congressman Frank O'Brien . Each candidate has preassigned numerical ratings for his campaign ability , financial support , fund-raising potential and press backing . Cards provide bonuses or setbacks . By the final tally , players will have suffered-on paper , anyway-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure . <P> THE NEXT PRESIDENT ( Esoterica ; $10 ) is the most complex of the three and can take anywhere from two hours to three days to finish . It has three separate phases . In the nomination phase , the players - as make-believe campaign managers - are issued strategy sheets , candidate-profile charts and a convention-vote score card . Each must decide which of the 22 state presidential-preference primaries to enter and how much to spend out of a set budget in order to win . At the convention , players jockey for state votes by offering ambassadorships , Cabinet posts or even money to rivals , then ballot to select a candidate . Next comes the election and finally , for advanced players , there are a whole new set of rules that allow them to toy with hypothetical scenarios that can pit Abraham Lincoln , for instance , against George Wallace . Another one : what if Nixon were to decline renomination and the Republicans , with a dark-horse candidate , had to enter the campaign against a Democratic party united behind Teddy Kennedy ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
