With a courtly yet uncompromising style , Senator Howard Henry Baker Jr. , 47 , has emerged as one of the Watergate committee 's toughest examiners . <P> Sometimes the Tennessee Republican belabors witnesses with rapid-fire questions . More often , however , the Senator cajoles the witnesses with sympathy and understanding , as he did last week to elicit more details about John W. <P> Dean III 's meetings with President Nixon . Indeed , Baker 's style as committee vice chairman has so impressed his colleagues that he has become one of the Republicans ' new luminaries looking to 1976-and one of the few to benefit from the Watergate scandal . <P> More than any other committee member , Baker has probed for the motives of those involved in Watergate . <P> Of Convicted Conspirator Bernard Barker , the Senator demanded : " What on earth would motivate you at your station in life to do something that surely you knew was illegal ? " Then , as Barker cited his own brand of blind patriotism as explanation , Baker exclaimed before the hushed committee : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Later Baker said : " I 'm not trying to establish the moral culpability but trying to find out what causes a man to do this , so that we can write legislation to keep it from happening again . " <P> Much to nearly everyone 's surprise . <P> Baker himself became a figure in the testimony last week . Dean recalled that White House staffers looked on the Senator as a potential friend . They asked him for a voice in the selection of the committee 's minority counsel but were rebuffed . Later , on Feb. 22 , he advised Nixon privately to abandon his stand on Executive privilege , at least for the Watergate hearings . On several occasions , Baker had flatly denied that there were any Watergate-related contacts between himself and the President since Feb. 7 , when the committee was formed . Later he admitted that he had indeed met with the President and explained that he had kept it secret for fear that publicity might diminish the chances of getting the President to change his stand on Executive privilege . Asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who could be influenced , the Senator replied : " It does n't bother me one damn bit because it did n't happen . " <P> That incident aside . Baker 's performance has drawn praise from Democrats as well as Republicans . He has been careful not to leak any secret testimony , and has stoutly maintained the rights of the three-man Republican minority . He comes to each session thoroughly briefed - by two of his own staff whom he assigned to the Watergate affair and by the committee 's minority counsel , Fred Thompson . Explains Baker : " I try to get a picture of who the man is , how he relates and what I 'd like to inquire about . "
