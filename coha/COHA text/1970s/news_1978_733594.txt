txt A SWEEPING PLAN to change the way jurors are selected and used , designed to eliminate many days of needless waiting for potential jurors , was announced Wednesday by Chief Judge John Boyle of Circuit Court . The plan , which could save the county government $1 million , will allow many persons selected for jury duty to finish their obligations in a single day . Others will be able to pick up the telephone the night before possible jury duty and find out whether they will be needed . " THIS WILL MEAN we wo n't have a bunch of jurors sitting around all week , " said Chief Criminal Court Judge Richard Fitzgerald , a strong backer of the plan . " We hope it also will mean that people will be more receptive to jury duty , and we 'll get a better quality juror , " be said . Under the present system , about 50,000 gooit County residents are . called annually to serve on , juries , each for a two-week stint . They are paid $15 a day , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such payments exceeds $5,5 million . Many who are called , however , find themselves with ? nothing to , do but talk or read while waiting for a court call that never materializes . LAWYERS ALSO COMPLAIN that after a week or more of such boredom , those who are called become unwilling to devote more time to jury duty . Court observers assert that jurors suffer from a " second-week syndrome , " in which they become cross and uncooperative , Donald O'Connell , administrative . director of the court system , said the plan is modeled after successful procedures already being used in Detroit and Houston . He said a pilot program will begin within several months at the Maybrook court complex in Maywood . If no hitches develop at Maybrook , the changes will be extended throughout the . county courts within a year ,
