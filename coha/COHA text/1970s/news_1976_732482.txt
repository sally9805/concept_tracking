txt New York City 's white population declined by more than 600,000 between 1970 and 1975 , according to an analysis of United States Census figures . During that period the Bronx became the first borough in the city 's history with a majority black and Puerto Rican population , the figures showed . At the same time , the city 's black population increased by only 29,000 . According to population experts , this means that the number of blacks leaving New York now exceeds the number of blacks moving into the city . The increase is attributable to more black births than deaths in the last five years . These were among dozens of findings of an analysis by The New York Times of a 1975 United States Census Bureau survey that was conducted on behalf of the city 's Housing and Development Administration . Based on data from 17,000 " housing units , " the survey indicated that the city 's total population had declined by more than 900,000 , to about 7.5 million . " We 're losing the white middle class , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " said Dr. Frank S. Kristof , director of economics and housing finance for the New York State Urban Development Corporation . " That makes losing the white middle class not quite as noticeable as it otherwise would be . " However , Dr. Kristof added that the increase in the size of the black middle class had been temporarily interrupted by the recession . Louis Winnick , director of urban and metropolitan development at the Ford Foundation , predicted that in the next 10 years the city would " keep breaking up into a network of strong pockets , " with whites remaining in areas like Greenwich Village , the Upper West Side , and Brooklyn Heights . " Virtually every other borough except Manhattan will become more Spanish , but enclaves ; will remain , " Mr. Winnick said . Causes Listed The loss of more than 600,000 whites-.between 1970 and 1975 was nearly as large as the decline in white population in the previous 10 years , indicating a sharply ? increased rate of " white flight " during the most recent period . Dr. Kristot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to the suburbs , ' partly because of the city 's deteriorating schools . This trend has been apparent since World War II , and now appears to he declining in intensity , because of the rising costs Or suburban homes . Young people moving out of the region . This trend has accelerated in the entire Northeast because of the loss of job opportunities . Elderly people , of whom a much larger proportion are now able to retire , moving to the suburbs and out of the region . The 1975 survey was broken down by borough into four different categories : white nonPuerto Rican , Negro non-Puerto Rican , Puerto Rican , and " other races . " such as Orientals and American Indians . The Puerto Rican and " other races " categories were the only ones to show substantial increases , each of about 100,000 people . Nevertheless , the Puerto Rican rate of increase is sharply reduced in comparison with the 1960 's . Between 1960 and 1970 , the Puerto Rican population increased by an average of 3.2 percent a year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2.5 percent a year . The city as a whole is now approximately 62 percent white 22 percent black , 12 percent Puerto Rican and 4 percent other races . The comparable figures in 1970 were 67 percent , 21 percent , 10 percent , and 2 percent . In 1960 , the city was 78 percent white , 13 percent black , 8 percent Puerto Rican , and 1 percent other races . " It 's what you would expect in the case of the blacks , because we do know that black migration from the South has been decreasing fairly rapidly , " said Larry Long , who is chief of the population-analysis staff of the Census Burean . " For the South as a whole ? from Maryland to Texas  --  there are about as many blacks moving to the region as moving from the region , " Mr. Long said . " That 's been the case only since 1970 . " He added that the reduction in the rate , of increase in the city 's Puerto Rican population was consistent with the Census Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving back to Puerto Rico than were leaving the island . Representative Herman Badillo , Democrat of the Bronx , attacked the 1975 figures as the latest example of what he said he believed was a consistent undercount of Puerto Ricans and other Spanish-speaking people in New York . " It 's way too low , " Mr. Badillo said of estimates for Puerto Ricans . He said there were 1.5 million Spanish-speaking residents in New York , including illegal aliens , compared with the 912.000 Puerto Ricans esti ? mated by the Census Bureau The Congressman cited a City University study saying that the official 1970 figures might have undercounted Puerto Ri. cans by as much as 25 percent . Queens Areas Cited Several population experts were skeptical about the latest figures for Queens , which indicated an increase of only 20 , - 000 Puerto Ricans in the borough , or a total of 16 percent of its population . Dr. Kristof said there had been a rapid increase in the number of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic residents in the last five years in the Jackson Heights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx experienced a net decline of more than 170,000 whites in the last five years , leaving it with a 44 percent white population , Brooklyn experienced the single largest decline in whites , nearly 240,000 . Mr. Winnick said there was no longer any questions that Brooklyn , which is currently 58 percent white , would eventually become predominantly black and Spanish-speaking . " But will it become middleclass black and Spanish ? " he asked . The city can live " very well " with a middle-class minority - group population , Mr. Winnick said . Similar Pattern City officials pointed out that even as Brooklyn was losing a large number of whites , the opposite trend was still discernible an the brownstone neighborhoods of Fort Greene , Park Slope , Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill , where the white populations were increasing . " The same thing is happening in other cities with a " rowhouse ' stock , " said one housing official . " People have been looking at all of the negative things going on , but very few people have been looking at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125,000 , whites between 1970 and 1975 , ' it was the only borough to experience a net decline in black population  --  nearly 90 , - , 000 . As a result , there were only small changes in the proportions of different races by-I ing in Manhattan , which now stand at 58 percent white , 21 percent black , 14 percent Puerto Rican and 7 percent other races . Dr. George Sternlieb , a professor at Rutgers University who has analyzed the latest data , said the question was " whether the city has the political courage to realize you wo n't be able to Supparc. the poor unless Manhattan is a refuge for the rich . " " You ca n't support the poor without the rich , " he added , " and every time someone rich stays in Manhattan it 's a triumph for the poor ? but that 's very hard to sell in New York . " " I wish I could say ' fortress Manhattan , ' but I do n't think I can , " Dr. Sternlieb said . Staten Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white population and total population . The borough 's white population increased by 18,000 , and its total population rose by 26,000.
