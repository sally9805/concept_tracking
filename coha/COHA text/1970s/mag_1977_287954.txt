A tale of roughriding diplomacy and engineering miracles <P> One Panamanian diplomat was said to be so upset when he learned of the original U.S. canal treaty that he punched his country 's envoy to Washington , Philippe Bunau-Varilla , in the face . Secretary of State John Hay wrote to a U.S. Senator : " You and I know very well how many points there are in this treaty to which a Panamanian patriot could object . " <P> could - and did . The treaty was pushed along by the big stick of Teddy Roosevelt , whose roughriding diplomacy virtually ensured long-smoldering resentment . As noted only last year in a Panamanian-made documentary film , The Treaty No Panamanian Signed , Roosevelt 's Administration received inside help from Envoy Bunau-Varilla , who was not a Panamanian but a Frenchman . Bunau-Varilla , it turned out , was less interested in the well-being of the newborn country than in the realization of his years-old dream : completion of the canal . <P> During the 1880s , Bunau-Varilla worked for a private French company that attempted to dig a canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a province of Colombia . Any canal across Central America would have eliminated the 7,000-mile journey around Cape Horn for ships navigating between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . At the time , most U.S. engineers favored a canal at sunny Nicaragua . The crossing there would have been 131 miles longer than at the 50-mile Isthmus of Panama . But almost all of the extra miles would have required no digging , since a Nicaraguan canal would feed into Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River . <P> The organizer of the French company was Ferdinand de Lesseps , who had built the Suez Canal , completed in 1869 , and who preferred the Panama site because he believed ( incorrectly , as it turned out ) that a Suez-style sea-level canal without locks could be built there . <P> But a sea-level canal required far more voluminous and difficult digging in mountainous Panama than had been necessary in the Middle Eastern sands . Few of the celebrated French engineers De Lesseps invited to inspect his plan approved it ( among the doubters : Gustave Eiffel , the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1889 , De Lesseps ' company went bankrupt . By that time , the French had moved 50 million cubic meters of earth-two-thirds of the amount moved at Suez . In the process , some 20,000 workers died of malaria and yellow fever ( whose causes were thought to be noxious jungle vapors and immoral living rather than bacteria-carrying mosquitoes ) . Originally known as " the Great Frenchman , " De Lesseps came to be called " the Great Undertaker . " <P> All the sacrifice notwithstanding , steam shovels , dredges and swarms of black West Indian laborers wielding picks and shovels scarcely scratched Culebra , an eight-mile stretch where the lowest mountain pass was 275 ft. above sea level . The main hope of the company 's creditors was that the U.S. would buy the French rights to the Panama project . Bunau-Varilla , at one time the company 's acting director-general , began to lobby the U.S. government to do precisely that .
