DEAR SIRS : As I interpret his article ? " Watershed of the American Economy " ( The Nation , Sept. 13 ) ? David Deitch makes three main points : ( 1 ) The inflation plaguing the United States  --  and the rest of the capitalist world  --  since , 1965 is the result of increasing loads of corporate and public debt , and the in  --  ability to service this debt without inflationary price in  --  creases . ( 2 ) The ' working class of the United ' States is in the , way of being " milked " by the corporate community and the economic technocrats in order to provide working capi  --  tal for a future business expansion . ( 3 ) A cabal of corporate managers and economic tech  --  nocrats . . . h'as consciously evolved an economic policy guaranteed to siphon off existing consumer savings , fore  --  stall wage increases of the working class not justified by increased productivity , co-opt labor , and garrison the United States against the rapacity of the world trading , community . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of inflation , Mr. Deitch has selected one= the increase in corporate and public debt  --  as the primary culprit . I think Mr. Deitch has confused cause and effect . I suspect corporate debt was incurred to finance expansion  --  which conceivably could have led to increased output and stable prices  --  and to cover the increased costs of doing busi  --  ness . I further suspect that the demand for labor back in 1965 and 1966 to provide both guns and butter during the Viet  --  namese War was a prime factor underlying the rise in both wages and prices . Also , " cost-push " elements involved in agreements of powerful labor unions in the past several , years have contributed to the ' " high fixed-cost structure " of the business community , as welLas the assumption of debt , . , . In any case , two indexes give pretty conclusive evidence that Mr. Deitch 's premise is on thin ground : ( a ) Wages and salaries vis- ? - vis profits as a percentage of GNP have maintained a stable relationship for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unit labor cost in recent years has gone down , not up . Second , the working class of the United States is made up of diverse elements , some of which have " milked " the rest of us quite handily . A labor union which extracts wage increases exceeding its productivity contributions takes it out of the hides of other members of the working class . . . . Third , I have reservations about the existence of the cabal so vividly portrayed by Mr. Deitch . . . restructuring the American economy . I had the idea that there were at least three publicly visible schools of economic thought extant in the United States , namely , neo-Keynesian , mon  --  etarist , and Galbraithian , and that Mr. Nixon 's Administra  --  tion has shifted from monetarist to neo-Keynesian , ( diluted ) to Galbraithian ( diluted ) , in the hope of finding some  --  thing to halt the continuing erosion of economic perform  --  ance . Mr. Deitch avers that Mr. Nixon and his economic technocrats planned it that way , and now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " The tone of - Mr . Deitch 's article implies that he con  --  siders the restraint of the prevailing economic anarchy to be relatively undesirable , but I am unable to perceive from the content of his article what form of economic or  --  ganization he aspires to . However , I infer , perhaps unfairly , that Mr. Deitch has an ideological bent that finds any form of capitalism distasteful . . . . John Yuccas Boston , Mass , DEAR SIRS : Mr. Yuccas ' tiresome tirade is , I hope , among the last of the Neanderthal attacks on " labor " as the culprit for what ails the economy . Some of the most conservative ( Continued on page 404 ) EDITORIALS Spotlight on the FBI In the February 8 issue of The Nation , we ran an articlel by H. H. Wilson of the Department of Politics at Princes , -e , .. ton , titled " The FBI Today : The Case for Effective Con-f trol . " Wilson called for public discussion of the problem o the FBI in the broadest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confines of the job which has been entrusted to it , how to prevent it from engaging in ideo-n , logical forays , violation of the privacy of law-abiding citizens , and other political mischief . A Once in a while a good idea catches on . This one did. , 1 As a direct result of Wilson 's article , " A Conference on the FBI " will be held on the campus of Princeton Univer sity , Corwin Hall , October 29-30 , sponsored by the Wood row Wilson School at Princeton and the Committee for ' Public Justice . The co-chairmen of the conference area Duane Lockhard , head of the Princeton Politics Depart ment ; Norman Dorsen , professor of law at New York 44 , University Law School , and Burke Marshall , deputy dean of the Yale Law School . Details may be obtained from 1 Stephen Gillers , the Committee for Public Justice , 23 West , - . 9th Street , New York 10011 ; telephone ( 212 ) 260-4545 . The papers already scheduled make up a brilliant4 J agenda : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selling of the FBI " ; " The FBI and the Bill of Rights " ; " An Insider 's View " ; " Scope and Basis for Data Collection " ; " The Ac  --  quisition , Maintenance and Dissemination of Derogatory Information by the FBI " ; " The FBI and the Use of In  --  formers " ; " A History of the FBI " ; " The FBI as a Political Police " ; " The FBI and Electronic Surveillance " ; " The FBI and Organized Crime " ; " The British Analogy " ; " The FBI and the Budget . " The authors are as informed and distinguished a group as can be imagined . Incidentally , 41 Doubleday will be publishing the papers in book form . In addition , there will be four panels of individuals who have experienced the Bureau in different ways . The panels in  --  clude former Justice Department personnel , former FBI agents , former informers , and specialists on federal-local 1- relations in police work . Nothing could be more timely than this conference and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . , It will be interesting to ' see whether the newspapers , TV and radio give it the coverage it obviously deserves . What t is not in doubt is that it will get intense attention in thew. echelons , high and low , of the FBI itself . The organization is in a bad way . The overlong tenure of J. Edgar Hoover has had somewhat the same effect on the Bureau as the Vietnamese War has had on the Army . Recent revelations in The New York Times ( October 10 ) of the discord be  --  tween the FBI and the CIA are only one indication . Of course the problem of the FBI is much larger than the problem of J. Edgar Hoover . At this stage , Mr. Hoo  --  ver 's principal importance is that nothing of consequence can be done about the FBI as long as he remains its direc  --  tor . For reasons of their own , the President and Attorney General Mitchell would welcome the opportunity to de liver encomiums on Mr. Hoover 's retirement . They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is a safe assumption that they do . Similarly , a good many of the Bureau 's officials would like nothing better than to see him go . ps Who can feel safe , much less appreciated , when a re  --  spected top man like William C. Sullivan is locked out of ' . his office and forced to resign ? The impression that Sul  --  livan and Hoover came into conflict over ideological issues is off the mark . Hoover did resent Sullivan 's declaration ' ghat the Communist Party , U.S.A. has nothing to do with leftist terrorism ; norwas he enchanted by Sullivan 's in- ' 4'idiscreet statement on organized crime see W. H. Ferry 's i. profit by the revelations , which in any case have been only letter , The Nation , April 26 , p. 514 . However , Hoover 's continued harping on the Red bogey is only one aspect of 9whis vocational senescence . The basic grieyance of the ini siders is that , what with Hoover 's increasingly tyrannical ? disposition and inability to keep up with changing condi- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its work . Some of its defects have been publicized , but Hoover is so intolerant of criticism that he has failed to " fragmentary . The discussions at the Princeton conference ion the FBI will give a comprehensive picture of the Bureau 's past and present deficiencies , as well as those ) ? of its 76-year-old director . It should attract national attention . ' ituffion : How Vulnerable ? Now is a good time to throw out a warning to the pi ' Democrats that President Nixon may not prove to be as vulnerable as the party 's leaders have imagined . In a re- ( vious  --  that the President has outflanked the Democrats cent Chicago speech , J. K. Galbraith points to the obon both foreign and domestic policy . On the economy , " the Democrats can no longer propose a policy different from his " ; all they can do is argue about implementation and criticize him for having failed for nearly three years 1 --  to come up with a relevant game plan . On the inter  --  national scene , the Administration has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tension . More to the point , the projected visits to Peking and Moscow are , n , almost certain to yield political dividends for the Presi  --  dent . Even if nothing much happens . at either summit , , the communiqu  --  s will make it appear that the talks have 01 been " fruitful " and the stage set for significant improve  --  ments in relations . The inherent news interest in both meetings will enable the President to dominate the head f lines immediately before , during , and for a time , after I , , both visits . . " ' On , returning from each visit , he will be hailed as a Lc peacemaker by his entourage . While the concrete ac complishments may be slight , neither the Russians nor the Chinese can afford to let Mr. Nixon return empty 0 , handed . i The war in Vietnam is still the major issue and here the President is indeed vulnerable , but the Democrats have not handled the issue astutely . They have let the President create the illusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nixon remains vulnerable. , He is not liked and never will be . His " image " is repulsive . He is , as the VISTA volunteers pointed out recently , , " the active enemy of the poor and the underemployed and the unemployed . " ' ' On racial issues he has been a total failure . And a strong case can be made against him on many issues and numer  --  ous counts . But still he will not be easily defeated , . What is most distressing about the Democrats at the moment  --  with exceptions  --  is that they continue to be bemused by so-called " consensus politics . " The " middle " has become an obsession ; most of the contenders are politically more cautious than the President . What they do not seem to grasp  --  again except for moments of illumi  --  nation  --  is that rank-and-file enthusiasm is not essential for the Republicans but is the indispensable ingredient in a Democratic campaign . Democratic Party leaders operate on the premise that young activists , since they con  --  stitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored . But enthusiasts iri politics  --  at least in Democratic politics  --  are worth many times their actual numerical strength , if only because they generate interest . It is difficult to get excited about any of the Democratic contenders , McGovern included , however much one may admire them as individual politicians . As a Vice Presiden  --  tial nominee  --  it is perhaps unrealistic to think that he might win the Presidential nomination ? John Lindsay would be of enormous value to the party because he does attract interest . As of this moment , then , the Democrats should force themselves to look at the emerging political realities . It is true , as Galbraith notes , that Nixon is " a loser who happened to win " in 1968 ; but the loser may again just happen to win , unless the Democrats can offer nominees and a program that will arouse the voter 's imag  --  ination and hopes . The President and the Court As this is written , it would appear that the President seriously considers designating Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court . His name , along with those of five con  --  servative jurists of small attainments , has been submitted ' to the American Bar Association . These proposals are still at the trial balloon stage , and if the reaction is sharp enough Mr. Nixon may not go through with his sardonic comedy of elevating Senator Byrd . But the fact that the Senator is high-on the list of those being discussed is a measure of the President 's political cynicism and lack of respect for the Court . It is a cynical business because the President knows that the nomination would acutely embarrass the Demo  --  crats and that in the end Byrd would probably be con  --  firmed . This would provide Nixon with sweet revenge for the rejection of the Haynsworth and Carswell nomi  --  nations . It would also , at least temporarily , shift a Demo  --  cratic Senate vote to the Republican column , since West Virginia has a Republican governor . And it would redeem the President 's promise to his right-wing constituency to put a " strict constructionist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might object that Byrd was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan , there could be the malicious retort that so too was Justice Black . But Black was a lawyer with an excellent record in the Senate . Senator Byrd was a one-time organizer for the Klan and , as late as 1946 , after he had ceased to be a member ( or so he says ) , he wrote the Imperial Wizard urging an expansionof the Klan in " every state of the union " and inquiring about the possibility of " rebuilding the Klan " in West Virginia . His record in the Senate suggests little more than a wealth of political cunning and diligence in the pursuit of unworthy objectives . But more important , Mr .. Nixon has made much in the past of judicial experience as a prerequisite for Supreme Court nominees . Senator Byrd. acquired a law school degree after moving to Washing  --  ton , but he has never practiced law , is not a member of* ( the bar , and has never had judicial experience . Hayns  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would , of course , be futile to appeal to the dent on any ground other than political expediency , but one wonders if it has ever occurred to him that the bestk politics might sometimes be to do the right thing . The nation is indebted to Republican Presidents for some ex  --  cellent appointments to the Court : to President Coolidge for Harlan Fiske Stone ; to Hoover for Benjamin Cardozo , Charles Evans Hughes and Owen Roberts ; to Eisen-4 ' hower for Warren , Brennan , Harlan and Stewart . 1 ' 144 retrospect it is obvious that from a political point of view these were wise appointments , in the sense that 4 they reflected credit on the judgments of the Presidents who made them . If President Nixon wants to remove some of the soot that darkens his image , he should giveee the nation two judicial appointments that measure up to those of Coolidge , Hoover and Eisenhower . Or to narrow-4i the range , he should not aim lower than Burger and Blackmun . If he should insist on Byrd , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court at a critical juncture in the Court and the nation 's history . And he ca n't fail to diminish his own stature still further . Natural History7 the monthly magazine of the Ameri can Museum of Natural History , contains an article by Ira J. Winn , ironically titled " Greetings from Los An- ' 11 geles . " It is abOut smog which , despite some countermeas ures , continues to plague the West Coast and to threaten a 4t catastrophe like the one that cost thousands of lives in London in 1952 , and on a smaller scale , in Donora , Pa. , and elsewhere . Los Angeles may be worse hit because , lying in a basin between the deserts and mountains to the east and the sea to the west , the megalopolis is subject to 1 blankets of hot air which , trapping the exhaust fumes from millions of automobile and truck engines , may form a 1. - lethal atmosphere . . , . , In Los Angeles industrial air pollution is a minor fac , 1 tor ; 85 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines of vehicles . The citizens are annoyed but , as always , complacent . Each neighborhood claims that it is relatively smog-free , although things are pretty I bad " over there ! " Smog is not an accepted topic of polite conversation ; one coughs , but does n't talk about it . One /00 reason for this taboo is that effective anti-smog measures would be bad for business . The automobile is to Los An  --  geles , as the ballistic missile is to the Pentagon  --  you ca n't get too much of it . The automobile of course requires the freeway , and more automobiles require still more freeway mileage . As Winn remarks , " Surely , the path to heaven from Los Angeles must be made of concrete , twelve lanes wide . " i Public transportation like those old Pacific Electric trolley cars  --  only now something on the order of San ' ' ' Francisco 's BART system would be needed  --  would mean fewer car sales agencies , lower consumption of gasoline and oil through service stations , fewer highway contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot that would have *I allowed  --  only allowed  --  local governments to allocate a fixed percentage of gasoline tax revenues for research , and , ? . , for a pilot study of alternatives to the automobile , includ  --  ing mass transit . A " highly financed " propaganda cam  --  paign was launched by the Southern California Auto Club , in league with oil , concrete and highway interests , and the 1 ) tcoerce keeps plugging for more population , , more , water proposal was soundly defeated . And the Chambelr of Corn- from the north , and more cars . , Even now , according to Winn 's figures , with only about 8 million population , on an average day some 26 million pounds ( 13,000 tons ) of smoke and soot are pumped into I. , . the Los Angeles air . Imagine what it will be like when , in ? 1975 , the population is expected to total 10 million . The rcr region is not entirely populated by madmen and produc --  tion of smog has been reduced since 1955 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical reduction will yi , be required if population and automobile ' registrations , ' i continue to rise . Or even if they remain where they are . all 1 Winn has some good ideas for averting catastrophe , as well as some , like the steam engine in place of the internal , combustion engine , that may not turn out to be practical . ' What could be done relatively fast would be to limit the size of cars and engines . Acceleration from standstill on an upgrade would be slower . So what ? There would be less smog , in Los Angeles and everywhere else . , Radioactive Tailings Tailings are the residue of an industrial process , as in mining , where huge piles of debris accumulate near the mine head . Usually these are more a nuisance than a menace , but the mounds accumulated in uranium opera  --  tions are radioactive . Neglect of their inherent dangers may turn out to be a deadly blunder on the part of the Atomic Energy Commission . Although the hazard was recognized as early as 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first , rivers were occasionally polluted and dust storms carrying radio  --  activity occurred . These " accidents " were bad enough , but worse was to come . The uranium tailings form a fine gray sand , and sand is valuable to builders for cement and mortar . Since the processing mills were glad to get rid of the stuff , they offered it free , and the builders came with their trucks and carted away thousands of tons . Thus , according to a roundup piece in The New York Times ( October 3 ) , in the city of Grand Junction , Colo. ( population 20,000 ; with suburbs , 40,000 ) almost 5,000 locations contain uranium tailings . The mill operators and the AEC saw no problem in thus disposing of the tailings because the radiation in the sand is at a low level  --  though persistent . But then , although the radiation level in a uranium mine is low and miners are allowed to work underground only forty hours a week , after fifteen or twenty years they display an abnormally high incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a decay product of radium . Cancer is the long-term danger ; there may also be chromo  --  some damage leading to genetically defective offspring , although the latter has been proved so far only in animal experimentation . Colorado is not the only state affected ; there are nine uranium-mining states in all . Colorado holds the AEC completely responsible . The AEC may have a legal de  --  fense : one of its regulations , later incorporated in a fed  --  eral code , limits its responsibility to " source materials " containing 0.05 per cent concentrations of uranium ( and thorium ) in ore . The tailings fall below that level , but they are not a source material . All this gives little comfort to the homeowner who is sitting on a concrete slab , or living above a concrete cellar and foundation , with radon seeping through the walls and floors . Numerous school buildings and other buildings are also involved . In the case of a residence , the average cost of jacking. up the building , digging out the basement area , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may rim as ' high as $15,000 . In addition , there is the possibility of damage suits by people who have been exposed to the radioactive tailings for years . All in all , it would seem that the AEC faces some highly " radioactive " consequences . Champions of Conservation When Portland General Electric Co. announced two years ago that it would build a nuclear power plant on the Columbia River near Portland , it ran into strong protests from conservationists and environmentalists , radiation scientists and seismologists ( the site is on a very pro  --  nounced fault ) . Despite the objections , PGE started con  --  struction of its Trojan plant . When a campaign to smear its critics proved unproductive , PGE hoisted itself on , the bandwagon , employing a much fattened advertising budget to proclaim itself a champion of environmental purity . A recent ( and typical ) ad , with a photo of snowy Mt . Hood , Oregon 's tallest peak , reads : " Oregonians still have one of the country 's most livable and enjoyable environments . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . To keep our rivers running clear and dean . . . . To allow Mt . Hood to stand free and un shrouded by man-made fog and smog . . . . To get rid of the rubble , trash , garbage , and junk . " And so on , and so on . Early in October the veil was stripped from PGE 's long-suspected hypocrisy . The district attorney of Clacka  --  mas County , the county contiguous to Portland in the south , filed a $28.5 million action at law against Portland General Electric Co. , and another firm , Crown Zellerbach Co. , charging them with killing millions of migrating fish at their West Linn facilities on the Willamette River . PGE operates a hydro plant at historic Willamette Falls , 13 miles south of Portland . Crown Zellerbach has a paper mill there . Roger Rook , the Clackamas district attorney , who asked the court to award the damages to the state of Oregon , was aided in his long investigation by members of the environmental law section of the Multnomah County ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that PGE and Crown Zellerbach have diverted , and are continuing to divert , a large portion ofthe Willamette River flow through man-made channels to provide energy to hydroturbines . During peak migration periods " large numbers of juvenile silver salmon , chinook salmon and steelhead trout under 15 inches in length en  --  ter industrial water intakes and are destroyed , " the com  --  plaint contends . It goes on to state that PGE and Crown Zellerbach knowingly and unlawfully have killed at least 5.707 million small salmon and steelhead since January 1 , 1966 . Remedial steps are available to both firms , as fishermen and conservationists have pointed out for several years , but , so Rook declared , the firms have refused to take ad  --  vantage of them . One wonders what Portland General Electric will say now in its ads , but it is a safe wager that it will continue to pose as a champion of conservation , All it need do is boost its advertising-PR budget once again , hire a few more writers of vivid prose , and keep warning Oregonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they must " get rid of the rubble , trash , garbage , and junk . " Charleston , W.Va , John Davison Rockefeller IV , West Virginia 's Secretary of State arid a Democrat , has n't announced formally that he will seek to be the twenty-ninth governor of his adopted state . But he has said repeatedly that , were he leaning any further in that direction , he would be lying on the ground . And several weeks ago he declared that under no circum  --  stances would he try for the seat of his fellow Democrat , Jennings Randolph , in the U.S. Senate . Whether or not the state 's senior Senator runs for re  --  election will affect the plans of Arch A. Moore , , Jr. , the second Republican to occupy the Governor 's office since . 1932 . The Governor , West Virginia 's Mr. Republican , enjoys anecdotes about his ability to walk on water . Capable , cunning , cocky , charming when he wants to be , unscrupulous , a speaker whose thunderous , machine-gun delivery camouflages paucity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to place the kindest interpretation upon his more outrageous contentions ) , Governor Moore is prob  --  ably the hardest working head of a state in the nation . That may be one reason why his fellow executives last month elected him chairman of the 1972 National Gover  --  nOrs ' Conference . A single example should suffice to show how Moore operates : the back end of Charleston , state capital , was doomed to be torn apart for urban renewal , a water treat  --  ment plant and an interstate highway . The ' natives had long been restless . Governor Moore arrived with aides , plus his highway commissioner , marched through the dis  --  trict , shaking hands , answering questions , offering advice , extending promises , and snapping off orders to assistants . He ordered the road commissioner to move in seventy-five trailers , by nightfall if possible , to reduce relocation dis  --  tress . That was in August of 1969 . The trailers , never materialized . Indeed , nothing resulted from the great man 's visit , but as an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , A foriner member of the House of Representatives  --  the lone Republican in a Democratic delegation ? Governor Moore prefers Washington to Charleston . Months before announcing for governor , , he told ex-reporter Harry Ernst of the Charleston Gazette that what he really coveted was a Senatorial toga , but to realize that'objective he had to be governor first . At that time West Virginia governors could n't succeed themselves ; thanks to a constitutional amendment , they now can . Nevertheless , it 's unlikely that Moore wants another forty years of parochial headaches , coupled with two opposition party legislative bodies  --  even assuming that he could trounce Rockefeller , whom he de  --  lights in criticizing . No other Republican has a prayer against Rockefeller . If Moore ducks that challenge to combat Randolph , he wo n't endear himself to party stalwarts . If he goes for a vacated U.S. Senate seat , however , although he thereby bequeaths the governorship to Rockefeller , he will be attempting to diminish the majority party 's power in Washington  --  an endeavor ' acceptable to party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel . He probably does n't know which office he 'll , file for and wo n't know until Randolph decides . And there is now the possibility that Mr. Nixon will appoint West Virginia 's other Sena  --  tor , Robert Byrd , to the Supreme Court , which would also open the road to Washington for Moore . If that happens , America 's embarrassment will be West Virginia 's gain , for it would almost certainly assure Rockefeller 's election as governor .
