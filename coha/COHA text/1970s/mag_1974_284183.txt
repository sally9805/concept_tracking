In February 1942 , two months after Pearl Harbor , Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order No. 9066 , a proclamation that ultimately consigned 110,000 Japanese Americans to ten internment camps . Though more than two-thirds of them were U.S. citizens , they were presumed to be security risks . The largest of the " relocation centers " was Tule Lake , a 26,000-acre dry lake bed 290 miles north of San Francisco . Last week a group of 200-wartime residents , their children and friends-visited the camp . TIME Correspondent Joe Boyce joined the pilgrimage . His report : <P> Tule Lake as the wartime internees knew it is gone . Only vestiges survive . To the west , there is Castle Rock , a jagged mountain of sand and stone upon whose crest is a cross , a more permanent version of the one Japanese Christians had placed there Easter morning 1943 . But the barracks that were frigid in winter , broiling in summer , and crowded always are gone . What remains now are concrete foundations and a few scattered sections of chain-link fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search their hearts and memories to evoke what it once was . <P> Thirty years ago , the interned Japanese-most of them U.S.-born or relatively assimilated-tried to turn Tule Lake into an American small town . Boy Scout troops and English classes sprang up , as well as softball and basketball leagues . Christian and Buddhist churches were formed and young people danced the jitterbug and the foxtrot under the eyes of watchful parents . <P> Christmas and Thanksgiving were celebrated , marriage and funeral rites were performed , and cultural traditions were renewed . But it was a bleak existence for the prisoners , many of whom had previously enjoyed middle-class comfort . Professionals , such as doctors and lawyers , were paid $19 a month for serving fellow inmates ; laborers received $12 to do menial work . Some residents took up sewing , flower arranging , making jewelry from sea shells-all to ward off the feeling of confinement . It was hardly a Nazi-style concentration camp , but armed guards and barbed wire were continual reminders of freedom denied . <P> Last week people in four buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Motives were mixed . " It was something my parents did n't talk a lot about , " said Kouji Nakutu , 30 , who was born in Tule Lake and left as a toddler . For the first 25 years of his life , he " went around denying that I was a Japanese American . " He returned to Tule Lake because " I want to trace my roots . " <P> One woman on the pilgrimage grasped the chain-link fence and recalled with tears in her eyes how she had done the same thing as a girl 30 years before , wishing she were on the other side . Another woman , Nancy Shibata , 43 , was a teen-ager at Tule Lake , where she met her future husband . " I was young enough so that I did n't feel bitter , " she remembers . Today the barbed wire causes more wonder than woe . " To look at it after you 're out-I said , ' Gee , we stayed in a place like that . ' It 's amazing that we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
