I was raised on country sunshine , I am happy with the simple things . <P> Millions of TV viewers would recognize this bouncy ballad , sung in the buttercup-bright tones of Nashville 's Dottie West , as the music for the current Coca-Cola commercial . A month ago , with a few alterations in the lyric , it also was released as Dottie West 's latest RCA recording . As such , it is a sign of a growing trend in the country music field to convert jingles into singles . Country music is not only becoming unabashedly commercial , as purists frequently complain ; now commercials are becoming country music . <P> The song from the Miller beer commercial , If You 've Got the Time , has been adapted as a single by Red Steagall . Sammi Smith has recorded the Bell System 's Call Me . Inspired by the Mazda car commercial , the Hummers have done Old Betsy Goes Boing , Boing . <P> Much of the credit , if that is the word , for the trend belongs to Songwriter Billy Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and record executive ( Chess Records ) who is now a vice president and music director of Manhattan 's McCann-Erickson advertising agency . Davis collaborated on the 1971 Coca-Cola commercial , which as a single , I 'd Like to Teach the World to Sing , sold over a million records . He and Dottie West wrote the current Coca-Cola hit , and he and McCann-Erickson Creative Director William Backer wrote the lyrics for the Miller beer single . There is some talk of dusting off Paint the World a Rainbow , the recent Coca-Cola radio jingle he produced , as a pop entry by the Spinners . <P> Meanwhile , advertisers are finding that such conversions can work two ways . Country Composer Tom T. Hall 's Me and Jesus has recently been revised as a sales promotion song for a chemical weed preventive . The title : Me and Treflan.
