ERTRUDE STEIN , the mortal center of Alice B. Toklas 's exist- ence for the thirty-eight years that the two women lived together in concentrated amity in Paris , died on July 27 , 1946 , leaving Alice companioned by two dominant preoccupations . One was vast in its scope , encompassing the New Testament belief in life after death , by which , in her interpretation , she and Gertrude were to he united again in Heaven for eternity . The other preoccupation was merely mundane , and thus much more bothersome . It was to prepare literary immortality for Gertrude by seeing that all her unpublished manuscripts were printed ; this project would require considerable cash , while the first would require only faith , which cost nothing . Four days after Gertnide 's death , Alice was writing from the apartment they had shared , at 5 Rue Christine , to their friends Carl and Fania Van Vechten , in New York : " I 'm here alone . And nothing more  --  only what was . " Two days later , on August 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso portrait to the Metropolitan the rest to inc - and then to Allan 's children -- so I definitell stay on . " On August 5th , to another pair of old New York friends , W. G. and Mildred Rogers : " I went to the country and got Basket her and Gertrude 's white poodle Sunday , and he and I will stay on here . " And to Bennett Cerf , Gertrude 's publisher , thirteen days after that : " And now Basket and I arc in the flat alone , where we definitely stay on . " " Staying on alone " ? Alice 's description of the twenty-one remaining years of her life without Gertrude  --  is both the heart-catching theme and the title of a book subtitled " Letters of Alice B , Toklas " ( Liveright , edited by Edward Burns ) . It is a rich , emotional volume . The broad sweep of information derived from family and household letters , from letters to prospective publishers of Gertrude 's work , and to biographers of Gertrude and to old and new friends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture not only of the major items in Gertrude 's and Alice 's lives together , viewed retrospectively , but also of what would likely he the items of prime importance in Alice 's future . " I wish to God we had gone together as I always so fatuousls thought we would  --  a bomb  --  a shipwreck  --  just anything but this , " she wrote sombrely to one intimate New York friend Memory Is All a little more than a year after Gertrude 's death . But though she had been left bereft , she was not left without occupation . Gertrude had willed her manuscripts and papers to Yale Uniersitv , and Alice obediently sorted and packed these and shipped them off . " When I 've finished sending things to Yale and done some typing and cleaned the fiat and caught up with darning and patching , " she wrote another old friend , early in her bereavement , " well , then it will be spring , and Basket and I will take walks and be in excellent form . " Yale held an exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curator of the university 's collection of American literature , " I am so thrilled with your description of the exhibition of the letters . What a variety there is of human nature in them . And your including the rejections the refusals  --  how Ger-trude would have appreciated that . You must know how those refusals hurt at the time they were received , but one day Blanche Knopf outdid even all Knopf 's Knopfishness , and then Gertrude forgot our hopes and hitter disappointment and burst into that loud laughter . " Another bequest  --  the 1905-06 Picasso portrait of Gertrude , which was given to the Metropolitan Museum  --  elicited from Alice , " They took the Picasso portrait for the Metropolitan ten days ago . It was another parting and completely undid me . Picasso came over to say good bye to it and said sadly vow n ; me , Er re-terra jamens neither you nor I will ever see it again . It was all there was left of their youth . " Whether dead or alive , Gertrude always had a domesticating influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the Stein-Toklas parties , the gentlemen would congregate loyally around Gertrude , while we ladies would be grouped around the tea table presided over by Alice , so we could get the gossip . Alice was a very entertaining purveyor of news . She gave it to you adding item to item , as if she were detailing the recipe for a fruitcake . You always knew where Gertrude was in the room , because she would let out her whoops of laughter ; curiously , I do n't remember ever hearing Alice laugh , although she had an acute and sharp sense of humor , which , since it was bordered with wit , was quiet in tone . Her conversation had its own pattern  --  she obtained a variety of effects by setting forth the opposite of what anyone else might have said . Her voice was soft , her California accent agreeable , her vocabulary precise , rhythmic , and possessed of its own sense of speed , with allegro touches . A great deal of this personality , this domestic intimacy , comes through in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Woojums for Carl Van Vechten , which thereafter figures in their correspondence . The very first letter in the book begins , " Dearest Fania and dearest Papa Woojums , " and is signed " Mama Woojums . " In subsequent examples , Fania an Vechten is Madame W. , and sometimes the Empress . Gertrude , whenever mentioned to the Van Vechtens , is Baby Woojums , or Baby for short . Other close friends have their own cozy sobriquets : Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Rogers are the Kiddies  --  Rogers was one of the first doughboys she and Gertrude had met during the First World War , and to show their familiarity with American slang they called him the Kiddie , which afterward was extended to " Dearest Kiddies , " or " Dear Mrs. Kiddie " when Alice is writing only to Mrs. Rogers , thanking her for a gift and , in return , presenting her with a recipe for an " old old French pastry called Massillon . . . They should he frosted all over with a white rum frosting with chopped pistachio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . " Gertrude was likely to plunge into intimacies like a bear cub , but with new acquaintances Alice observed the formalities until the friendship had ripened to a first-name basis . Thus , Mina Curtiss , who had been introduced to her in 1948 , after Gertrude 's death , as a friend of Virgil Thomson and Carl Van Vechten , progressed gradually from " Dear Mrs. Curtiss " to " Dear Mina dear . " Referring to Gertrude by her first name was more easily achieved . " Oh but you must say Gertrude  --  it would n't he friendly ' to do otherwise , " Alice wrote Mrs. Curtiss . " You know , it was the very young who explained that , when they started the habit twenty-five years ago . It was quite shocking at first , but they finally convinced me , and in no time it was accepted  --  historical and no further trouble . It was contagious , so that the G.I.s spoke not of but to her not as Gertrude but Gertie  --  those at the station when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here in the flat she was very ceremoniously Miss Stein . Afterwards on the stairway ... " Like Gertrude , however , Alice could be ambivalent about friends old and new . To one of the latter  --  an Italian translator of " The Making of Americans , " who had graduated from " Miss Pivano " to " Nanda dear , " she wrote in 1950 , " Paris has been full of Americans  --  two million  --  at least have conic to see me  --  they bore and exhaust me though I only see those who were friends of Gertrude whom she would have wanted to see ... but then in spite of wanting to see them all  --  some of them used to bore her . Did I ever tell you she once said she was going to put an advertisement in the New York Herald Tribune saying Miss Gertrude Stein does not desire to see any friend she has not seen for fifteen years ? " Alice also had a gift for keeping the heat on under smoldering vendettas . Qne was against the Museum of Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Metropolitan , in an arbitrary private transaction , agreed to " deposit " the Picasso portrait of Gertrude with the Modern for a period of ten years , Alice coldly informed the Metropolitan that Miss Stein had very deliberately chosen it to receive the portrait , and , had there been any other choice , " the Museum of Modern Art would not have been an alternative ... indeed Miss Stein thoroughly disapproved of its policy and aims . " Alice kept up such a vigorous campaign , through lawyers and friends , that the Metropolitan was finally goaded into reclaiming the picture . Having won her victory , Alice yet continued her gibes . To a casual acquaintance , she wrote , some years later , " Please do not ask me to chide your wife about the Metropolitan 's giving the portrait to that frightful Museum of Modern Art for ten years  --  since it got back to where it belongs much more quickly than one had reason to hope for .... Is your wife possibly connected with the Museum of Modern Art ? If she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after that , in another letter  --  Alice could he really hard  --  she reports that three people from the Museum of Modern Art were brought to see the pictures in her apartment , and said of the Picassos that " they had never seen such fine Braque painting . " She goes on , " 1 held my tongue  --  that was in the other room . Then they came in here and repeated their error . Silence de ma tart . They appealed to me was it not ? pointing to the big picture over the fireplace . It would he if it were  --  I permitted myself to answer . And I plied them with sherry  --  pn'ti brioche ' and my best little cakes  --  allowing myself to tell the story  --  sans discrection to anyone who will listen . " Early on , Gertrude , and therefore Alice , had taken an aesthetic stand favoring Picasso 's work against that of Matisse , which the latter , not unnaturally , had resented . When Gertrude , in " The Autobiography of Alice B , Toklas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a horse  --  meaning it as a compliment  --  the comparison was misunderstood . Then the Paris newspapers aggravated the issue , the fat was in the fire , and " there was no further acquaintance " with Matisse . However , with Alice , to be out of sight was not necessarily to be out of mind . In 1950 , some seventeen years after the malentendu , she was still sniping away , writing to Donald Gallup that Matisse was " amongst the majority the common-place majority as Gertrude called him  --  of the sad and mistaken . " Even when she is quoting for her own advantage something the painter had said , - she can not resist a sneer : " It 's as true and trite as most of Matisse 's reflections . " About Ernest Hemingway , another of Alice 's objects of ill will , she was also implacable : " Did you see The Yorker 's profile of Hemingway ? l Nothing he has said since  --  not even his novel  --  will be as complete an exposure of all he has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he taking so much pleasure in destroying the legend he worked so patiently to construct . Someone ... sent an A.P . man to see me , and I gilt into a frightful row with him about Picasso 's painting and Hemingway 's new book ( as if they could be mentioned in one sentence ) ? he the A.P . man said he thought Picasso was painting carelessly and Hem was writing carelessly ! ... I liked defending Hemingway  --  it was the first opportunity I 've ever been offered -- it will no doubt remain a unique experience . " And a few days later , after she had been sent some uncomplimentary reviews of Hemingway 's new novel , " Across the River and Into the Trees , " she wrote , " People seemed to think they would please me . Far from it  --  the whole Hemingway legend  --  which we saw him create and soigne , - going to pieces as it is under one 's eyes is the most pitiable embarrassing thing imaginable . The present Hemingway crack up one must borrow from the vocabulary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned biblical punishments and rewards for comfort to those living in the present . But of course that is just what he does n't do ,  - -  . ? he is hopelessly 1890 and one can damn him no further . He wears like the New Look but he is in the tradition of Kipling . " Interspersed with Alice 's malice is Alice the dedicated housewife . " Amateur art is n't satisfactory  --  is it ? " she inquired rhetorically of one correspondent . " When I used to hake a cake for Gertrude I never asked is it good , I always said does it look like one that came from the baker 's  --  it should have tasted better because the material it was made of was of a superior quality to what the baker used but was n't mixed and baked in a professional way , which was what would make it look like the baker 's . Well it was often that Gertrude thought it did . Finally some one said one looked as if it had come from a Women 's Exchange and Gertrude said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , postwar indifference in Paris to giving or receiving small change , so an pical of the French : " Having learned the value of petiirs t'cononnes in ' 15 , it leaves me flabbergasted  --  how can one save sous ( that is present francs ) if they are n't returned to one  --  it 's very confusing if not immoral . " Unavoidably , since la Nen-ainzr is never far from her thoughts , Alice reveals certain of Gertrude 's personal , eccentric preferences . For instance , Gertrude could not hear having anyone read aloud to her  --  a habit French authors were addicted to . " I read with my eyes , not my ears , " she told Picasso . " Ears are inside me . " To which Picasso , who could he as elfin as Gertrude , said , " Of course writers write with their eyes , painters paint with their cars . And further neither painters nor writets have ever been painted with their mouths open . " We learn that " Gertrude would n't have heen amused with the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? she thought that he was being grossly overrated . He was not one of the writers whom she chose as examples of expressing our sense of abstraction . " or did the Joyce novel " Ulysses " please Gertrude : " She once said it was rather more than she could manage of the Irish fairies that Irish fairies were even less palatable than German fairies . " Gertrude did , however , have an " unfailing appreciation " of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's work . Ulysses S. Grant she considered our greatest eminence ? " not second to Lincoln but first . " Picasso she thought of as a younger brother . " They understood each other in spite of saving dreadful things when they were irritated , " Alice writes . And , least surprising in this List , it was , Gertrude felt , unfamiliarity that bred contempt .

Toklas ... to her use for life " and , " insofar as it may become necessary for her proper maintenance and support , " the executors were authorized " to reduce to cash " any of the paintings in the Stein collection , which , at the time the will was drawn , in July , 1946 , included twenty-eight Picasso paintings and a portfolio of his drawings , as well as seven Juan Gris canvases . Permission for the sale of any of these art works was to be obtained from a **25;5101;TOOLONG estate administrator . Upon Alice 's death , the remainder of the estate was to go to Allan Stein , only child of Gertrude 's oldest brother , Michael , and , after him , to his three children . Gertrude had told Alice that she wanted everything every manuscript of hers  --  published , and Alice quickly set out to implement her desire . Although diminutive in size and rather bent , Alice had the strength of a giant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had already made it her function to coordinate the conveniences of daily living to accommodate Gertrude 's hours of writing , even when they took place at night . Five weeks after Gertnide 's death , Alice informed Carl Van Vechten that the first publication , by the Yale University Press , would be " Four in America , " one of the " difficult " Stein manuscripts ( the four subjects were George Washington , Ulysses S. Grant , Wilbur Wright , and Henry James ) , for which Thornton Wilder had offered to write a long introduction . The book appeared in the fall of 1947 . " Is n't ' Four in America ' perfect ? " Alice wrote to Dearest Kiddie . " Is n't Gertrude the essence of U.S. ? How I wish she could have seen the book  --  it was always the happiest day of the year ( way back it was of the decade ) when a new hook of hers came in the post and she spent the morning or the whole day reading it . And then when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eventually , through her penury and self-denial , plus her driving determination , Alice saw eight volumes of the unpublished . works printed by the Yale University Press . She also helped support herself during some trying times by writing an idiosyncratic , chatty cookbook , which sold well , and " What Is Remembered , " a less successful volume of memoirs but , in my estimation , he most entertaining book . The Baltimore court had appointed an elderly lawyer , Edgar Allan Poe  --  the poet 's great-nephew  --  as istrator of Gertrude 's estate . Gertrude ' had been precise about how her funds were to be spent , but , unaccountabh , Poe proved to be an obstructionist and parsimonious in fulfilling her wishes , of which he seemed to disapprove , although it was none of his business . Alice cajoled and threatened , Poe sent money in driblets , and in 1954 Alice , who was desperate , finally sold about forty Picasso drawings without informing Poe  --  and , upon what now seems the poor advice of Daniel-Hcnr ) Kahnweiler , Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plot machinations that followed would have done credit to a Victorian novel . In Alice 's order ) existence with Gertrude , there had never hen any-melodramatic or violent eruptions . But with Gertrude gone , the difficulties so often attendant upon the inheritance of property and interpretation of testa ments were inflicted upon her relict , Alice . Allan Stein 's wife , Rouhina ( referred to scornfully in these letters as the Armenian , although she was in fact Rumanian ) , kept a beady eye upon the pictures in the interests of her minor children . In 1951 , Allan Stein died , and the children were in line to inherit after Alice died . In 1961 , while the increasingly infirm Alice was absent in Acqui , Italy , taking a mud-bath cure for her arthritis , Mrs. Stein procured a court order to have the pictures removed from the Rue Christine apartment to a Paris hank vault , on the ground that their security was endangered by Miss Toklas 's absence . When Alice returned from Acqui she found the walls hare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend pathetically . " My dim sight could nut sec them now . Happily a vivid memory does .... Do n't worry about me I am 84 years old . All old people fall  --  an aunt skating on the ice  --  a granduncle jumping off a streetcar . " ( Alice 's imagination was always lively . ) In going over an inventory of the pictures , Roubina Stein had discovered the Picasso drawings missing . She accused Alice of illegal behavior , which was true enough , since she had not sought Poe 's permission before she sold them . Alice , on her side , ins ; sted , with equal truth , that she had been within her rights , according to Gertrude 's will . To aggravate the tension , Poe was inexplicably three months behind in Alice 's monthly allowance . " My eves are a great trouble , " she informed Russell Porter , the Paris lawyer she had engaged to protect her  --  and little enough help he was able to be . " I can write only by holding the paper within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... It is urgent that he Poe sends me the money by wire at once for I am down to bedrock ....

" Her financial situation was so precarious that some of us among her old friends raised a fund for her maintenance . Alice was hospitable ; she took to inviting us in turn to Gee-fen restaurants for lunch , after which , in settling the bill , she was inclined to leave the equivalent of twenty dollars as a tip , in addition to the regular service charge . We also discovered that she would send her servant to Fauchon 's fancy shop to buy her weekly groceries . ( She thought the best was none too good and , as a matter of fact , sometimes not good enough .

The building at No. 5 Rue Christine was sold , and each occupant was offered the opportunity to buy his apartment . Alice ignored this opportunity , being of the optimistic opinion that she would not be evicted , because of her advanced age . While she was in Italy for her annual arthritis cure , the new owner of her flat sued for possession and won the case . Although powerful friends intervened  --  even Andr6 Malraux , then Minister of Culture , for Gertrude Stein 's name was still potent , and Alice was regarded as her official survivor  --  the French law was adamant . To rehouse her , the musician Doda Conrad and I , after a fruitless search for the kind of old-fashioned Left Bank quarters she was accustomed to , finally had to settle for a comfortable and modern , if unpicturesque , apartment at 16 Rue de la Convention  --  a noisy commercial street , several miles from the Rue Christine flat , which had been so perfectly peopled with her recollections of Gertrude . Alice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially deaf , and almost blind . From her pillow in the new apartment , the only view she had was , ironically , that of the local parish church from which she was to be buried three years later . As a little girl in San Francisco , she had been created a Christian in the most casual way by a Catholic friend of her unorthodox Jewish parents ; the friend , Alice once told rne , had sprinkled he with holy water , which , with childish faith , she had regarded as a valid baptism . In late 1957 , after receiving instruction from a very obliging English priest , who supplied her with a missal and a rosary ( which she thereafter wore looped around her left wrist ) , she was officially admitted into the Church and received Holy Communion . She was now ready to meet Gertrude in " the peopled heaven .

" Dead is dead but that is why memory is all and all the immortality there is , " Gertrude had written years earlier in " The Making of Americans . " It is a quotation not often mentioned , and surely it would not have been Alice 's choice as the epitaph for their mutual earthly devotion .
