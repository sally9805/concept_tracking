We must realize that we have a choice : we are responsible for our own good time ... <P> When you do something you are proud of , dwell on it a little , praise yourself for it , relish the experience , take it in . <P> Homilies like these , delivered by two little-known Manhattan psychoanalysts , fill a 54-page book that is selling at the rate of 10,000 a week . How to Be Your Own Best Friend ( Random House ; $4.95 ) is indeed heralded by some of its 250,000 readers as this year 's Jonathan Livingston Seagull , promising yet another flight to happiness . <P> The book has been touted by showbiz types like Actor Anthony Perkins , Columnist Rex Reed and Playwright Neil Simon ( if he 's gloomy , he says , he downs it twice a day like a pill , with a glass of water ) . To be sure , some of these enthusiasts whose advertised endorsements boosted the book 's sales happen to be patients of Mildred Newman and Bernard Berkowitz-the husband-and-wife team who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen . But the bestseller obviously has other less prejudiced fans as well . " It seems like something a good friend would say to you , " explains Bonny Simmons , a California real estate broker . Another reader credits How to Be Your Own Best Friend with enabling her to pass her driver 's test after having flunked it seven times . <P> As its title suggests , the book is a psychiatric pep talk in the long tradition of self-help books that provide what Psychiatrist Karl Menninger once called " bibliotherapy . " Children used to learn how to live from their parents , notes Herbert C. Kelman , professor of social ethics at Harvard . But now " every generation is on its own and often seeks a packaged way of acquiring wisdom . " <P> Gentle Persuasion . The Berkowitz-Newman brand of wisdom is vaguely Adlerian ( Berkowitz attended the Alfred Adler Institute after taking his Ph.D . at New York University ) . Adler invented the term inferiority complex , and the book is aimed at people with shaky selfesteem . As Adler did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least . Actually the authors want to have it both ways : " When you try to do it all out of will power , you are not treating yourself with respect . You are making the assumption that change has to be imposed from above , that your self does n't have its own impulse to do better . " But they add : " You need to learn to work with yourself , to use your will power on the side of yourself . Of course , that does n't mean you ca n't use some gentle persuasion . " <P> Manhattan Psychiatrist James Baxter argues that such roundabout reasoning is contradictory . Nevertheless , he says , the book is appealing because " a bedrock of respect for oneself is essential , and today we are rampant with self-recrimination . The U.S. is having a crisis of conscience unparalleled since the Civil War . " <P> Gary Schwartz , assistant professor of psychology at Harvard , agrees that the tenor of the times makes people long for " more control over their own lives . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . " Adds Mildred Lerner , past president of the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis : " In today 's alienated society , nobody 's got a best friend . People want a way to nurture themselves . "
