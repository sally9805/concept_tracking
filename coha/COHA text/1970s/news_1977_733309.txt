txt The Soviet Union is more interested in putting mechanical puppets than men on the moon at this juncture . Indeed , there is as yet no sign that the Russians are planning to send humans to follow up past American landings on the moon . " I see no reason for a prolonged stay by men on the moon , " Soviet space scientist Georgy Petrov declared recently in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda . But puppets or robots ? that is another story , according to Mr. Petrov , who heads the Moscow Institute of Space Research . He foresees " a manned circumlunar'orbital station with a set of automatic devices ? ' mechanical puppets ' ? capable of descending to the lunar surface to conduct suitable investigations there and come back . " This also would allow robot inspection of the side of the moon which is permanently hidden from the earth . The next few years , therefore , may see more Lunokhods ( radio-controlled wheeled robots ) running over the surface of the moon to bring back soil samples for study ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life on that planet . The Soviet Union remains keenly interested in Mars , despite a long series of space probe failures aimed at the so-called " red planet . " // From page 1 Post-Sputnik era " Sooner or later , " says Mr. Petrov , - man will set foot on that planet . But first we should answer the question of whether there is life on Mars . I believe that delivery of soil from the planet is the way forward here . " These statements , says a Soviet commentator , are fully in accord with Soviet space policy , which always has maintained that more information can be obtained for less effort by using automatic vehicles than by landing men . Another Soviet target for an automatic explorer , the commentator said , was the giant planet Jupiter . Such subjects were matters for comment as Western space scientists visited Moscow for celebrations marking the 29th anniversary of Sputnik I , which heralded the dawn of the space age on Oct. 4 , 1957 . The Russians , meanwhile , have fallen behind in their plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28th Congress of the International Astronautical Federation , which opened in Prague , Czechoslovakia , on Sept. 26 , believe the cause is related to new research equipment being prepared for long-duration missions aboard Salyut space stations . Earlier this year , cosmonaut Pavel Popovich was predicting a long-duration space mission beginning this summer , but the launch window came and went without result . Instead , Salyut 5 , which had been visited by two teams of Soyuz cosmonauts , w44 made to re-enter the atmosphere . It burned up over the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 8 . In the meantime , it has been confirmed by Western tracking stations that the " mystery " spacecraft Cosmos 929 , launched from the Tyuratam cosmodrome in Central Asia on July 17 , is probably an unmanned test of a new vehicle related to the Salyut program . It appears to have been launched by the big Proton booster . The Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough , England , says the vehicle has been maneuvered several times by Soviet mission control . On Aug. 26 it was swinging round the Earth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strong signals have been picked up similar to those of the Soyuz and Salyut spacecraft , according to the Space Observation Group at Kettering , England . These developments apart , there is much talk in Prague of the coming utility of space stations for industrial purposes .
