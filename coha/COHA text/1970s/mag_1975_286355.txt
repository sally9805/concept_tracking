When Sarah Caldwell was a child in Maryville , Mo. , her favorite day of the year was the Fourth of July . She loved to stage elaborate backyard fireworks . As would happen later on , Sarah 's creativity was challenged . " I was not allowed to bring them home until the night before , " she recalls , " but I had them put aside for me in stores all over town . I would set them all out on the table and look them over : sparklers , snakes , cherry bombs , Roman candles , firecrackers . Then I 'd make my plans . " Sarah 's displays were a hit in Maryville . She says with satisfaction : " I was a specialist in nighttime fireworks . " <P> Today the stick that Sarah uses in her shows is a baton instead of a punk . As for the fuses , they are infinitely more elaborate connections . But at Boston 's Orpheum theater , or wherever her Opera Company of Boston is playing , she lights up music , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> She is justly called the first lady of American opera , but there is no one man in the U.S. who can match her versatility , resourcefulness and sheer talent . In just a few years , all by herself , she built a great opera company in Boston , a city that did not really want one . Operating in what a colleague describes as " a wilderness of gymnasiums , hockey rinks , old movie houses , an indoor track and a converted flower stall , " Caldwell produced operas , including difficult ones that no one else would touch , and staged them ingeniously ( she had to , given her cramped quarters ) . Working day and night as her own conductor , administrative boss , stage director , talent hunter , principal researcher and fund raiser , she has become a symbol of the vigorous growth of opera in dozens of cities around the U.S. She is also one of the great impresarios in all the American performing arts . <P> Boston has known and enjoyed this for years . From now on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss elsewhere around the U.S. , and not just because she carries close to 300 Ibs. on a 5-ft. 3-in. frame . Next week she will become the second woman to mount the podium at the New York Philharmonic ( the famed French pianist and teacher Nadia Boulanger was the first , in 1939 ) . The program , co-sponsored by Ms magazine , will be entirely devoted to the works of women composers ( see box page 59 ) . In January she will become the first woman ever to conduct at New York 's Metropolitan Opera , leading Verdi 's La Traviata , starring Beverly Sills . In addition to all this , she is conducting the Pittsburgh , Detroit , New Orleans and San Antonio symphonies this season . <P> It was Dr. Samuel Johnson who described opera as " an exotic and irrational entertainment . " No one exemplifies that early diagnosis more than Caldwell . Her success story is anything but logical or coherent . Her energy would be impressive for a basketball star ; for a beach ball of a woman , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Ezio Pinza imitating a woman , " but she can sweet-talk almost anybody out of , and into , anything .
