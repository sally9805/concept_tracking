Generally , the Libyans are quick to back any anti-American movement , and there have been statements of support for Ayatollah Khomeini . But two weeks ago the Libyan Government issued a . statement urging that the American hostages in Teheran be released . Today , in a published interview with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci , Colonel Qaddafi said that he had tried to persuade Ayatollah Khomeini to release the hostages , but he repeated that the . whole world hated the Americans and would soon enough turn against them .

When asked about that , the spokesman said that " Libya is not a country in which demonstrations and other public mani , festations happen in the same way in which they happen in this country . " He said it was clear that there had been no sign of any official resistance to the attack , adding that this was what had prompted the protest . Some officials said it was possible that Libyan authorities had approved or even organized the rally , but that the demonstrators had gone further than planned in attacking the embassy . Washington 's protest was lodged in Tripoli by William L. Eagleton , the embassy 's charg ? d'affaires .
