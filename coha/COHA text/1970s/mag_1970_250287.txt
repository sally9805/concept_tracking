Why was Princess Anne 's mood in the U.S. as blue as her royal blood ? London 's Sunday Mirror last week blamed " the witches of Washington . " Wrote Mirrorwoman Paula James : " Everywhere that Anne went , the witches went too-pushing and shoving the Princess and asking questions . " In remarkably similar language , another London Sunday paper hissed that Washington 's " ladies of the broomstick " harassed Anne . And who are the witches ? The unsigned piece in The People meowed : " The group of ill-mannered ragbags who call themselves social columnists . " <P> Washington 's female press corps reacted by baring its own claws . The real reason for Anne 's sulk , said Lynn Lang-way of the Chicago Daily News , was that " she just found out who won the Revolution and she 's a sore loser . " Other reporters complained that when they tried to get close enough to the Princess to hear her quotes , they were elbowed out by Miss James . One remembered the way she dealt with a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an " American pig . " <P> The flying feline fur blurred a few facts . Far from being harassed by hordes of U.S. newswomen , the Princess was regularly accompanied by a pool of only six reporters , two of them British . True , the U.S. pool members included U.P.I. 's Helen Thomas and A.P . ' s Frances Lewine , among the fiercest rivals in the entire Washington press corps . But both , by their normal standards , were considerably subdued in the royal presence . Miss Thomas asked Anne only one question : how she liked the view at the Washington Monument . When the Princess frostily replied , " I do not give interviews , " Miss Thomas uncharacteristically gave up . <P> As for pushing and shoving , Miss James should have seen the two wire-service combatants when they accompanied President Nixon on a yacht ride in California last summer . Finding only one ship-to-shore phone available , they almost came to blows as they wrestled to make the first call . That sight might have made even Princess Anne smile .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
