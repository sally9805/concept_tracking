The boss runs from home to the office almost every day , his hair flopping in the Tennessee breeze , his loping strides covering ten miles between 6:30 and 8 a.m . He confesses an addiction to LSD-long , slow distances . It began during the Viet Nam War , when Air Force brass threatened to dump him as flight surgeon because he weighed a puffy 220 . Now he is down to 168 . He is 41 years old , and he ran the Boston Marathon for the first time last year , then repeated this year . He wants to do all the big marathons . Last month it was London , this month it will be New York , next Hawaii . Health is his business , and , if they meet set minimums , he pays his employees an extra 4 for every mile that they ride on a bike , 16 for every mile they run , 64 for every mile they swim . The boss gets a special bonus . Says Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. : " Every time I run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The idea that has made Frist many millions was to bring modern management to hospitals/Only eleven years ago , he joined with his physician father and a local venture capitalist to take over a hospital back home in Nashville . They standardized procedures in what was a cottage industry , benefited from mass buying , brought in everything from simple cost controls to sophisticated equipment . Today the Hospital Corporation of America , of which Frist is president , owns or manages 130 hospitals in the U.S. plus eleven others in Saudi Arabia , Panama and Australia . Revenues this year will exceed $1 billion . <P> On this run to riches , Tom Frist has also acquired a lot of ideas for reducing inflation in medical costs . Perhaps , he says , the Government should cut back its funding for educating doctors . The U.S. is training too many of them , and the oversupply leads to too much unnecessary testing and surgery . On the other hand , tae trend to concentrating all medical specialties in just one hospital in a region is unwise because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-heart surgery , for example , doctors practicing there can earn $500,000 , $600,000 , even $700,000 a year . " <P> Yet it is also unwise to set federal ceilings on medical costs because hospitals will compensate by skimping . " The first year , they tighten up on small expenses ; the second year , they cut some educational programs ; the third and fourth years , they do away with certain services , like ambulatory care and obstetrics ; the fifth and sixth years , they start trimming quality , maybe buying lesser brands of equipment . " The same downward spiral afflicts countries that adopt national medical insurance , Frist believes . " Hospitals and doctors have to compete against other popular programs for Government money&gt; and they often lose out . So medical care deteriorates , as it has in Britain , Canada and other countries . "
