txt THE PUBLIC housing of CabriniGreen is not more than a mile from the Gold Coast 's plush condominiums , but it might as well be in a different world . The Near North Side , like other parts of the city , has boundaries that separate different kinds of people . In some places urban renewal bulldozers have created a kind ? of neutral middle ground . In others , certain streets have served as less obvious borders between neighborhoods ; an old house is advertised as " Victorian " while a. block away a similar structure is called a slum . This year , the doors will open on several new housing developments designed to cross these boundaries . Some hope to succeed by drawing middle-income people to areas previously populated by the poor . The developments will change , the Near North Side geography because both the affluent and the underprivileged will be offered homes under one roof . THE LARGEST and perhaps boldest of the new developments , Atrium Village at Division and Wells streets , once was promoted as an effort to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . by creating a bridge for living between the two communities . " By erecting 307 luxury apartments on a site surrounded by vacant lots , the old Cooley Vocational High School , and dilapidated rooming houses , this project effectively will change the boundaries that separate rich and poor on the Near North Side . Although only a few thousand people will inhabit Atrium Village , and other similar developments , the projects are being watched closely by other realtors who say success might signal an opportunity for much more extensive construction in the territory that lies south of the Lincoln Park neighborhood and is wedged between Cabrini-Green on the west and Old . Town on the east . " OF COURSE Atrium is important , " said Daniel Levin of Associates , a major Chicago developer . " It is a cignifiranr addition to the area because of the quality of the development and because of the location . " Kenneth B. Marshall Jr . of the Illinois Housing Development Authority DMA ) also considers the location important because of what it reveals about housing in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation about an apartment building at Division and Wells would have ended with a big question mark . That obviously is n't true today . " Marshall pointed to two important changes : improvements in the quality of life at Cabrini-Green and a " tremendous " growth in the demand for Near North Side housing . WHILE CABRINI-Green retains " stigma , " its " negative impact " on the area has been lessened , Marshall said . An estimated $10 to $15 million has been invested in social services and security measures , and the project houses fewer of the most unstable kinds of tenants , large families with only one parent . The number of people looking for Near North Side housing parallels the growth of North Michigan Avenue and P.ush Street as shopping and entertaina cat centers . A recent lull in construction and the rapid conversion of many rental buildings to condominiums has realtors describing the housing demand , with terms like " limitless , " " unending , " and " insatiable .

ATRIUM VILLAGE A PREsTIGE NEW RENTAL COMMUNITY ut1S , . OR : : ; CinAGOO5LEANS K ? J:SING CO.PORAT : ON ? 1 . , ** C. , 04tICL ?

That 's no problem at all . From now on it is strictly a question of economics . " However , future development into new areas will be " very slow , " Rubloff said , unless the government offers inducements to offset high construction costs . FOR ATRIUM VILLAGE the " inducements " came in the form of a joint state-federal program , administered locally by IHDA , that offers developers loans at below market rates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 per cent of the apartments to low and moderate-income tenants . Rent for these subsidized units is tied to family income . The government makes up the difference between what the subsidized family pays and what the landlord charges other tenants . For most projects , an upper limit is also set for the number of units that will be subsidized . Nearly 10,000 units , most in the suburbs , have been built under this program in the Chicago area since 1968 , according to J. S. Fuerst , assistant director of urban studies at Loyola University . Atrium Village is being put up by a nonprofit organization formed by four churches . The subsidy program is more than an economic necessity for these developers . It is " a chance to do something very positive but very complicated , " according to Lucille Wallace , who is in charge of marketing for the project . " Our goal , " she said , " is to offer the option of quality urban living to a variety of people of different races and incomes . " TILE COMPLICATHONS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to persons of less income " in an area not known for luxury living . These obstacles will be overcome , she said , through the sheer quality of housing . A nine-story building with 205 apartments is being constructed around two skylight-covered courtyards or atriums . Another 102 units will be contained in three-story clusters on the same sevenacre lot . Middle income tenants will be lured by a swimming pool , tennis courts , and parking spaces . Each unit will have a balcony or a terrace , dishwasher , airconditioning , and a disposal unit . Al ! this bait will be offered at " substantially lower " rents than for similar apartments on the Near North Side , according to IHDA . ALTHOUGH THE development authority 's feasibility study for Atrium Village noted that the project could he filled quickest if a majority of the units were rented to subsidized tenants , no ratios have been set for the number of subsidized and nonsubsidized tenants . " The kind of development is important because it offers good housing to that great mass of people who earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " Fuerst said , " but if the subsidized tenants are dominant , the place could be doomed because it will take on the image of a public housing project and the middleclass tenants will leave . " John Cordwell , an architect and urban planner . expressed a different kind of worry about Atrium Village . " When you 're redeveloping a poverty area , you ca n't nibble away at it . " Cordwell , who designed the Carl Sandburg apartment complex , said that in that project " we went in with strength , like in a military operation . Some 1.100 apartments went up the first year . You just ca n't drop a few middle-income people in by parachute .. . . The question for Atrium . I guess , is whether it can fight its way back to the main bridge . head on the Gold Coast . " WHETHER A HOUSING project leads to the redevelopment of an entire neighborhood is not , however , the only measure of success . Consider the case of Dick Brown , the man primarily responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townhouses , at North Avenue and Vine Street . Through most of the early 1960s , Brown was an angry activist in the Near North Side 's black community . In 1966 , he organized Neighborhood Commons Inc. as a nonprofit operation to provide housing for the low income people being displaced by the Lincoln Park neighborhood 's rapid expansion . This winter the development will be complete . In order to pay the bills , Brown expects to offer only 35 to 184 units to subsidized tenants . All but eight of the 30 townhouses have been sold for $76,500 to $90,000 . Only a fraction of Brown 's tenants will be the kind of people he set out to build housing for . " TIME BEAT US. " he said . " Every year for 10 years the construction costs have been going up past what our people could pay off in rents . Then we just got too far along to ' turn back . " He paused . " The important thing is we did the job . We did the job and no one thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get better homes than they ever expected . " A DECADE AGO , Bill Moorehead was an activist involved in many of the same causes that concerned Brown . This winter he , too , opened a housing project , the Evergreen-Sedgwick Apartments . Though Brown 's development lies on the dividing line between prosperity and poverty , North Avenue , Moorehead 's apartments are deep in the rundown neighborhood that lies east of CabriniGreen . The land was cheaper and the apartments are far more modest , so according to Moorehead 's arrangement with the federal government all 84 units will go to people receiving some kind of subsidy . Though Moorehead met the goal of providing housing for the poor , he , too , has a feeling of limited success . More than 500 persons ' applied for the apartments . and Moorehead said it was painful to turn away so many . " We 're going to build some more apartments , but I know we just do n't have the resources to save this neighborhood for all the people who live here now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's not a matter of race . It 's just economics that count . Poor people . by definition , do n't have resources , and we know the people with resources will come here eventually , probably pretty soon . " The absentee landlords will realize they can rehabilitate and then triple the rents . The speculators are already coming around and they 're going to start making offers that our homeowners ca n't refuse . There are people who 've lived here for 30 years and they 've got no security . " RUBLOFF SAID Chicago needs " 40,000 to 50,000 residential units around the downtown to give the downtown a solid backup and to bring middle-income families back into the city . " But if this happens , some foresee new and different problems . " Where are all the poor people from the North Side going to go when this redevelopment takes place ? " asked Ben Finley , director of Afro-American Family and Community Services . He argued that the kind of building Rubloff and others envision will not help the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finley 's agency has headquarters just a block from the site of Atrium Village . Though that kind of subsidized housing " appears to be the wave of the future , " he said , it does not provide the answer because it does not cater to those who need housing the most , " the poorest of poor , the kind of people that are n't appealing to the folks who pay for tennis courts and air conditioning . " THE POOR DISPLACED from the Near North Side will be forced into the ghettos of the South and West sides , Finley said . " This will just create added pressures in those parts of the city where crime is the highest and the school system and all other services are already overtaxed . That ca n't be good for the city . " Finally , Finley turned to the subject that seems to end every conversation about new construction on the Near North Side . ' " What 's going to happen to Cabrini ?
