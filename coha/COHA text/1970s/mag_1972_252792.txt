&gt; The West Point cadet 's path to graduation is studded with booby traps . He can be " skinned " for a dirty uniform , shaggy hair , a dusty room and a host of other minor offenses . Cadet Joachim Hagopian , 22 , of East Longmeadow , Mass. , collected 107 demerits for the first half of this year , five more than the maximum permitted , and was therefore dismissed . He decided to appeal to the courts . In New York , Federal Judge Charles L. Brieant Jr . granted a preliminary injunction , ordering the academy to reinstate Hagopian pending a trial . In his 18-page decision , Brieant noted that almost half of Hagopian 's demerits were reported by his company 's tactical officer , who then awarded the demerits and finally determined whether the demerits were correct , without Hagopian ever receiving a fair hearing . " Such merger of prosecutorial and judicial function in a case leading to expulsion , " Brieant said , " does not satisfy due process or the simple needs of natural justice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ever-increasing number of waterfront suburbs are trying to keep outsiders from their beaches by making them pay stiff fees . The New Jersey Supreme Court took a stand against that trend by ruling that Avon-by-the-Sea must stop charging nonresidents a $2.50 beach-use fee when residents pay only $1.25 a day . Writing the majority decision , Justice Frederick W. Hall said : " The public trust doctrine dictates that the beach and the ocean waters must be open to all on equal terms . " <P> &gt; When Mrs. Fannie Jefferies quit her $125-a-week typing job in New York , she decided to begin training as a teacher at Queensborough Community College , and to go on welfare as a needy mother . Three months later , city welfare officials decided that she was not eligible for benefits because her college was not a vocational school . Besides , she could already support herself as a typist . Mrs. Jefferies brought suit , and was joined by three other women in similar circumstances . Federal Judge Charles H. Tenney ruled that " the crucial issue " was whether the federally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college programs , as well as those attending vocational schools . " He said that the federal statute permitted welfare recipients to get " institutional training , " and therefore the states could not deny them benefits while they pursue a " specific vocational objective " in college . <P> &gt; " At what point , " asked Queens County Civil Court Judge Leonard Finz , " does a jury 's reasonability end and a judge 's reason begin ? " At issue was a hospital bill of $8,999.45 charged to Mrs. Elena Bubliatis . She and her husband had been severely injured in an auto accident , and the husband later died . Because their medical insurance was deemed insufficient to pay all the expenses , the hospital got Mrs. Bubliatis to sign a guarantee-of-payment form for her husband 's bills while she was still under , as Finz put it , " extreme physical and emotional stress . " When the hospital sued to collect , the jury found in its favor , but Finz set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial . Said he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing , an unconscionable result would remain that would be offensive to the professional sensitivities of the court . "
