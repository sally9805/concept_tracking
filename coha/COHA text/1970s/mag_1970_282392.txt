The workers in the nation 's proud and powerful building trades unions are among the highest paid in the land . For the most part , their jobs have been passed down , generally to friends or relatives , though nepotism is on the wane today . The building unionists have kept the door closed to most of the blacks who would like to join . Of the U.S. 's 1,300,000 card-carrying construction workers , only about 106,000 are black - and four-fifths of them are laborers , the lowest paid of the lot . <P> In an effort to pry open the closed doors , the Nixon Administration last year sponsored a plan that would force contractors bidding on big federal projects to recruit blacks . After consulting contractors , union chiefs and black leaders in a city , Labor Department officials would determine the number of jobs to be made available in each building trade . The plan was first tried in Philadelphia , where contractors were supposed to raise the number of blacks among new workers from about 5% to 25% by 1975 . Today this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Government aimed at 1,000 more construction jobs for blacks , but Philadelphia contractors so far this year have hired and trained only 60 . The greatest barrier appears to be a legal one . Opponents of the plan are testing it in the courts , ironically arguing that it violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which prohibits racial quotas in hiring . A federal district court in Philadelphia recently ruled that the plan 's goals do not amount to illegal quotas ; the decision is being appealed . Until the legal uncertainties are resolved , contractors and Government agencies are unlikely to pay much attention to the plan . <P> Escape Clause . To get around the Philadelphia Plan 's mandatory federal guidelines , union and black leaders in several cities have adopted alternate " hometown " plans , which call for voluntary quotas . These plans are generally not faring well . In Pittsburgh , negotiations between union and black leaders dragged on for months . Finally a compromise was struck : 1,250 new jobs for blacks by 1974 . In Chicago last summer , union and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 blacks into building trades unions . Although the Labor Department has granted $498,000 for training , only 75 blacks have been recruited-and the peak construction season is more than half over . The agreement has an " escape clause " that ties the unions ' recruiting efforts to the state of the local economy . Since construction activity is slack , the unions do not want to train blacks for jobs that even whites can not get . Moreover , Chicago blacks have been slow in pressing for more jobs . <P> St. Louis ' experience with its hometown plan reveals another pitfall . Seven of 18 unions , accounting for just over half of the city 's 45,000 building trades membership , have committed themselves to hiring blacks . The plan was held up until $524,500 in federal training funds came through last month . Within a week , 25 blacks were being trained , but not in highly paid unions like the electricians ' , plumbers ' and steam fitters ' . Arthur Fletcher , Assistant Secretary of Labor , sums up the situation : " Neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darn thing yet . "
