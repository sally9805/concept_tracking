It was Gerald Ford 's week , and he made the most of it . Projecting a fresh sense of confidence in himself , his policies and his political future , the President used the power of his office to take attention away from Ronald Reagan , his Republican rival , and from a crowded field of Democratic candidates . Ford used the State of the Union address and the budget message not only to lay out his programs but to launch in earnest his campaign for election in November . <P> Shaping the theme of his budget and his campaign , Ford relied on his instincts-and the findings of pollsters . Both told him the nation was fed up with what he called " bigger and bigger Government . " Declared the President : " The American people know that promises that the Federal Government will do more for them every year have not been kept . I make no such promises . I offer no such illusion . " Ford urged the nation to practice the " common sense " once preached by Tom Paine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " restraint " and " self-reliance . " The President said , " The time has now come for a fundamentally different approach to Government , for a new realism that is true to the great principles upon which this nation was founded . " <P> Popular Idea . In the abstract , the notion of restraining-or at least reshaping-the Government is a popular idea these days even with many liberal Democrats , who have scented the same political winds as Ford . What is more , the President 's conservative budget will certainly help him against the conservative Reagan . But it is also certain to embroil him in sharp battles with Congress . <P> In terms of specific issues , Ford took the calculated gamble that while jobs are a burning concern , most Americans are even more worried about reducing the rate of inflation . But Ford had to do more than settle on a budget that was austere enough to fight inflation , which he predicted would drop from an average of 9.1% in 1975 to 6.3% in 1976 . He had to make sure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery . The President settled on a total of $394.2 billion for fiscal 1977 , up only 5.5% , compared with the jump of 15% this year . Ford 's budget would produce a deficit of $43 billion , compared with this year 's figure of $76 billion . <P> Economists clashed over whether Ford 's budget was too restrictive ( see following story ) . Actually , the budget was up $21 billion from the current year 's record total . Yet inflation and the natural momentum of existing programs would have sent it soaring by $50 billion if Ford had not proposed reducing the growth of a number of Government activities .
