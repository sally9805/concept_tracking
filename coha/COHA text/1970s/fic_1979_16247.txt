1 INT . VAN DORN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY Four generations of the Van Dorn family have gathered at the family home . A long kitchen leads to the dining area , then to the spacious living room .  --  3  --  The house is perhaps one hundred years old ; deeply varnished woodwork and patterned yellow wallpaper section off the walls . Apart from several recent tasteless acquisitions ( an E-Z Boy lounge chair to replace the old Queen Anne which broke two Easters ago ) , the house remains furnished in the style of the previous century . The old dining room table , which Grandfather Van Dorn built because he was too cheap to buy one , has now become a priceless antique . The rooms are littered with religious calendars , Bibles and plaster-of-Paris plaques bearing such sentiments as " As For Me and My House , We Will Serve the Lord . " The oak buffet is laden with similar religious knickknacks and chintz . Framed , tinted photographs of the family patriarchs are indiscriminately mixed with newer snapshots of proud fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continuity . Generations come and go ; the family remains . All of life 's " old home scenes " have been played out here : births , deaths , romances , blasphemies , betrayals . And now the air is again alive with the sounds of playing children , busy housewives and bickering uncles . The kitchen is crowded with mothers , daughters and aunts . Each has brought a special dish . ANNE DE JONG ( nee Van Dorn ) , thirty-five , supervises the final preparations . One aunt shows another snapshots of her new grandchild . JAKE VAN DORN , forty , and his brother JOE , fifty , sit at the table watching the kitchen activity . The house echoes with small talk : &nbsp; AUNT . . . He got accepted at Grand Valley , but he 'd rather go to Michigan . . . &nbsp; NEPHEW #1 . . . Get that pink rot . . . &nbsp; NEPHEW #2 . . . No way Uncle Joe talk me into cutting celery again this summer . Rather work in the car wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , it passes a cluster of men standing near the buffet . WES DE JONG and JOHN VAN DORN , both about forty , casually discuss a theological point with GRANDFATHER VAN DORN . Across the table , a young boy , about eleven , listens with rapt awe . These are men of the soil . Their faces are sun-blotched and weather-beaten . Wes has rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt ; John has switched to a more comfortable plaid . &nbsp; JOHN . . . I still say that if a man has committed the unpardonable sin , he knows he has . Grandfather nods head approvingly . &nbsp; WESI do n't know about that , John . It do n't seem to account much for God 's grace . &nbsp; JOHNWhat kind of grace do you mean , universal or specific . . . ? DISSOLVE TO : 2 INT .

" KRISTEN VAN DORN , fourteen , and MARSHA DE JONG , fifteen , are scrunched onto the sofa . Kristen has long blonde hair , a clean Dutch complexion and an unaffected beauty . The girls ' legs are innocently wrapped around each other's.  --  5  --  JOE , forty-five , another of the Van Dorn brothers , and a male cousin about nineteen , are also squeezed on the sofa . Young children squat on the floor in front of them . All are watching some inane Christmas variety show . Joe , bored of this tripe , gets up and turns off the set . The children wail in unison . " Aw , c'm on , Uncle Joe . " &nbsp; JOEI 'm sick of watching this television stuff . You know who makes it ? All the kids who could n't get along here . They go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' em when they were here , and I do n't like ' em out there . One of the youngsters reaches over and snaps the set back on as Joe leaves the room . CUT TO : 4 INT . LIVING ROOM - DAY As Joe leaves the den , he passes Jake Van Dorn and Wes De Jong . Unlike his older brother , Jake is not a man of the soil . He has been to college and runs his own business . He looks well-groomed and comfortable in his navy suit , white shirt and striped tie . Wes is Jake 's brother-in-law and friend . They get along well enough . &nbsp; JOE ( to Jake and Wes ) Television . If you do n't buy one yourself , the kids go someplace else and watch . And what do they sell on television ?

We need him to play the Christ-child . &nbsp; RUTHBut Timmy 's only six months old . &nbsp; BILLWe wo n't hurt him . I 'm going to be Joseph , Jane 's Mary and Lenard will be one of the shepherds . Bill looks at blanket-headed Lenard , who has no idea of what 's going on . &nbsp; RUTHI do n't think so . . . &nbsp; NADINEYou ca n't do that . That 's blasphemy .

In another part of the factory , laborers assemble chair frames . Jake walks along the assembly line with MARY , a well-dressed , attractive employee about twenty-five . They turn a corner and step into a display area where a set features the Van Dorn Co. ' s new modular office designs . Mary shows Jake the set for his approval . &nbsp; JAKEIs this all the display space we can get ? &nbsp; MARYI tried to get more , but this is the limit . The De Vries line has the same area .

Perhaps a stripe across the back wall .  --  11  --  He gestures . Gently , relentlessly , Jake manipulates Mary . He does not wish to impose his taste on her but , through calculated argument , will get her to accept his views . It 's only a matter of time before he wears her down . &nbsp; MARYNo , that would be much too overpowering . &nbsp; JAKEYeah , overpowering . That was the word I was looking for . &nbsp; MARY ( sensing his ploy ) Mr. Van Dorn , I 've worked on the color scheme for weeks .

DOWNTOWN GRAND RAPIDS - DAY Jake and Mast walk out of the Pantlind and walk up Monroe Avenue . The heart of Grand Rapids , like that of many Mid-western cities , is a ghost town . The major businesses have one by one gone broke or moved out to the suburban malls , leaving the core of the city to cut-rate stores , parking lots and federally-subsidized government buildings . &nbsp; MASTThis used to be a real city .

Another young man , wearing only pink elastic shorts , steps into the frame and takes Kristen into his arms . The quality of the action is quite low ; the young men posture and overact in the manner of high school dramatics . Occasionally , the action stops while the actors receive cues from an off-screen director . Grunts and groans are dubbed into the screen action . Only Kristen 's performance lends a note of credibility to the proceedings . She is genuinely disoriented or fright ened --  or both . She 's not play acting . For one frightening moment , Kristen , regaining full consciousness , fights back , but the youth in pink shorts slaps her into submission . Her eyes turn pleadingly toward the camera . The first youth laughs and takes Kristen into his arms . The youth in the pink shorts kneels on the edge of the bed and instructs Kristen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the first youth fucks her from the rear . As the film ends , Jake sinks his head into his hands , speaking to himself . It 's almost as if we 're hearing his thoughts : &nbsp; JAKEIt ca n't be . Why me ? What have I done ? Looking up , he says softly , then louder : &nbsp; JAKE ( continuing ) Turn it off . ( a beat ) Turn it off . ( a beat ) Turn it off !
