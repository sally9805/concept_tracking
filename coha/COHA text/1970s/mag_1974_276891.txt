Determined voters braved heavy rain to get to the polls in Oklahoma last week . The main attraction was the contest for Governor in the Democratic primary , and the result of the record turn out was a resounding defeat for incumbent David Hall , 44 . The Governor , who won only 27% of the votes , will not even get a chance to compete in the mid-September runoff . That opportunity now goes to first-term Congressman Clem McSpadden , 48 , a pop ular singing cowboy and rodeo announcer , and Baptist University Professor David Boren , 33 , a Rhodes scholar whose unexpected political ascent is being compared to a prairie fire . <P> Hall won high marks for upgrading education and improving prison care and health services , but they were erased in the electorate 's view by the still unproved charges of the misuse of campaign funds and the receipt of kickbacks that have dogged his administration . <P> Both McSpadden and Boren stressed reform , McSpadden with the slogan " Honestly , there is a difference , " and Boren by dubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean sweep in November .                     @x Determined voters braved heavy rain to get to the polls in Oklahoma last week .
