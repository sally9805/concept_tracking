txt The ' case of . Attorney General-designate Richard Kleindienst , the lady lobbyist for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation , and the huge sum which ITT offered to contribute to the next Republican National Convention while its antitrust suit was being settled , grows ever more complicated and disturbing . When a corporation with monopoly ambitions gets in trouble with the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division , it has long been a routine  --  if deplorable  --  practice for the corporation 's officials and lawyers to lean on anyone in the ' Government who could conceivably be helpful . It is the obvious duty of responsible public officials to stand firm against such pressures . Fortunately the career attorneys in the Antitrust Division have a ' tradition of impartiality and of devotion to the spirit of the laws which they , administer . But they can not serve not public interest if their political superiors do not back them or , even worse , if their superiors tamper with cases ' and override professional judgments . Against this pragmatic background , the attitude and actions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging in this ITT case look increasingly unsatisfactory ..

The participation Of White House aide Peter M. Flanigan in shaping the frt. settlement is  --  or ought'to be ? ' highly irregular : The work of the Antitrust Division will collapse if , politically well-connected companies can go over Its head and ' cook up deals at the White House . Mr. Flanigan has no statutory authority to deal with antitrust matters . Yet it was he who recruited a young Wall Street broker to prepare an economic analysis of the issues in the ITT case . To no one 's surprise , ' this analysis was markedly sympathetic to ' Since the Federal Government has many qualified economists , why was not one of them asked to prepare this analysis ? ? Mr. Flanigan 's fishy activities in this case ? need to be fully explored . So does that $100,000 ? or was ' it $400,000 ? ? which an ITT subsidiary offered to subsidize the G.O.P. convention . in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
