txt The problem of the so-called boarder babies  --  children stuck in hospitals for months and sometimes years after the medical reasons for their hospitalization have disappeared ? is said by municipal administrators to have resulted from a " bureaucratic morass . " Even a superficial penetration of that morass provides an Instructive lesson into how and why governments so often work badly or fail to work at all . Boarder babies are children who have been kept in a hospital for medical treatment and for whom parental custody has been interrupted by city officials or forfeited by parents . A good example of a boarder baby would be a child born addicted to drugs as a result of his or her mother 's addiction . Because such children often suffer from retardation or physical handicaps of varying degrees of severity , their in-hospital stay can result in further debilitation . According to a study done by the State Assembly 's Select Committee on Child Abuse , at least 87 and perhaps as many as 200 children who should not be in hospitals in New York City have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with their problems and because of lack of badly needed stimulation . The situation is multi-faceted ; but the crux of the matter is that the child care system in the State of New York does not function for a portion of these children . As a consequence , appropriate alternatives to vegetating in hospitals are not available to them . Among such alternatives would be placement in institutions designed to deal with their problems , foster care or even adoption . ' Some of these children do receive appropriate treatment . Others do not . * City officials charge that state agencies are sometimes reluctant to carry out their responsibilities . They allege that the Department of Mental Hygiene , which by law is responsible for care of the retarded , is not taking in new patients because it is overwhelmed by the task of solving questions resulting from the Willowbrook lawsuit . They also assert that the State Health Department will not set the standards of care or Medicaid rates for treatment of children who are not acutely ill , but who am so handicapped that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the state level , according to city officials , alternatives that ought to be available are in fact not available . But , because of the way the child care system in New York works , alternatives are less unavailable to some groups of children than to others . There are some facilities which , though clearly insufficient for the numbers in need , do provide appropriate care . They are run by private agencies that provide services financed with public funds ; yet as in other aspects of the child care system , sectarian preferences have tended to influence placement choices , to the detriment of black and Puerto Rican children . Thus , while one private , publicly supported agency for retarded and emotionally disturbed children had only 18 black children out of a population of 68 in 1973 , 46 out of the 57 boarder babies known to city officials last August were black . No matter how complicated its sources , the result of the morass is the bitterly cruel and gradual destruction of the least and most helpless of individuals the state and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental problem and human decency demands that it be solved .
