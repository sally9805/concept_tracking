than the light in the office , since we have to work tomorrowand Sunday anyway . And Melanie 's ecstatic with the thought of cooking for both of us , she says I wo n't have to lift a finger , you know how she loves to pamper . " Still numb . What else was she trying to apologize for ? More hesitant . " Do n't be angry , love . I would n't have been worth much this weekend anyway , running up to the office every spare minute . And you do n't have to worry about the shopping , either . I 'll do it all Monday afternoon when I get home . " And a pause . " It 's just that we have to get this job finished and it 'll be so much easier at Harrison 's . " " Well , " he said , furry tongue slow in a dry mouth .

You think I 'm too sleepy to see that roll of flesh you pinch in the mirror after you snap your bra closed . You come back from Melanie 's cooking with more than an extra pound or two on you and I 'll kick your ass ! " Swallow , hoping she would n't say , I wish you would . " I am not getting fat ! " Mock outrage only . " Well , you ask Harrison . He ought to know . He sees you more than I do . " He yawned again . " Look , try not to work too hard .

Ellen still owes me money from that World Series bet , I 'll take my payment in kind . " Not the kind I 'd prefer , but probably all I 'll get . " In kindness . I 'll just call up and claim my winnings . And Sunday night I 'll get Harriet and Tim to take me uptown to that Indian place .

" He let her wait for an answer . " I 'll miss you . " Bullshit . But he did n't even snort . Twitches of contempt and shame chased themselves down his spine . " I 'll miss you . Kiss Melanie for me , but tell her I 've still got bones to pick . Maybe another time I can manage not to lose my temper at her table . Goodbye . " He guessed her brisk whirl to Harrison , elated , another successful maneuver to escape his office . But her image faded after her receiver clicked . He set the phone down and his apartment expanded before him , fresh , for an instant a stranger 's home , artifact of unfamiliar taste . He stumbled , bare-2Ifoot , into the living room , struck by its comfortable white severity  --  low , rough pine wall benches Laurie had insisted on broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , rows of bookshelves he 'd clumsily hung bearing wares that carefully defined a pair of sensibilities contemporary , if not catholic . " This is yours , you live here ? " the little girl he 'd picked up at The Tattoo had exclaimed . He realized what she 'd seen . LAURIE He waited a week to tell me about her , and then insisted it did n't mean anything . Which was much , much worse . But I let myself be persuaded . Rainy October in a fall she ruined for him , forcing arguments about her operation . " It does n't make sense to postpone it any longer . My periods are n't getting any easier , and none of the doctors we saw had any hopes they would . If anything , they 're getting more painful ! And whenever we finally do decide to have a child , I 'll have to get it done anyway , and the more I wait , the harder it 'll be , recuperating . I 'm not getting any younger . I want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all . " Glowered at her , sullen , incapable of discovering whatever logic might dissuade her . Knife-happy doctors convincedher , New York 's a surgeon 's paradise . " You do n't know anything about it . You think you 're brave , but even a headacheknocks you out . This 'll flatten you for months , it 's not like tonsils , you do n't walk out the next day with a sore throat . I know , I watched my uncle go through three operations , you 'll feel like you 're renting somebody else 's body . For months afterwards you 'll ache , you 'll wake up with your scar throbbing or run short of breath coming home from the supermarket and22have to rest on somebody 's stoop wondering if you 'll ever get your energy back . Any operation upsets your equilibrium , and messing with tubes is not minor , no matter what those doctors said . " He stared at the clenched line of her jaw as she shook her head . " You 're wrong to try to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convinced not to attempt . It 's got to happen , you ca n't keep putting it off just because I take pain badly . You 're only thinking about yourself , you 're worried I 'll be impossible to live with until I heal , you might even have to minister to me ! I 'll go to Sharon 's till I 'm well enough to fend for myself , for god 's sake , the last thing I 'd do is let something as minor as an operation interfere with your comfort . It 's taken me two months to convince myself to go through something we knew was inevitable all along , why are you trying to stop me ? " No answer but moroseness . Sulk . She did n't instinctively hate all doctors , bloodsuckers and hypocrites , did n't feel debased by their cold hands and calculating grins , who should she trust ? And in theory , of course , he was committed to the idea of children , once the time was clearly right . She wore him down by repeating herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argumentand swore she 'd pay . " It 's not you who has to put up with the pain every month . Even the damn Darvon does n't help that much  --  when I do conk out for a couple of hours I wake up feeling seasick . Or stoned . " " I have to put up with its effects , I never imagined it was pleasant ! But we get through it . And there 's other drugs you have n't tried yet ! If you think the pain balances what you 'll go through just on the chance that they can straighten it out , 23then go ahead . But do n't think it 's just a week in the hospital . It 's three months , four months out of your life , how the hell do you measure that one ? " " I 'll find out , " she said . She did . The nurses let him stay twenty minutes after visiting hours ended , until they produced the pill that would grant a fuddled but syrupy doze . " I 'm afraid we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurie goodbye , containinghis rage till he reached the hallway and then stomped down the corridor , aching to arc fat gobs of phlegm over the thin white curtains of each ward doorway , fuck asepsis ! They beat me , he kept whispering , they beat me good , expertise again . They made up their minds first time they saw her , another candidate , another guinea pig , and tomorrow morning they 'll cut her . Fucking butchers ! They 'll wheel her in , knocked out , ashen , transfusions and intravenous ready on those goddammetal trees they hook to the bed , spinal she wo n't even feel paralyzing her , ready for dissection . Another lab animal ! Bastards . Nursing his third whisky at The Tattoo 's bar he caught her eyes , masked by too much shadow under an elfin haircut , watching him in the huge mirror . Lifted his shotglass in what he hoped was wry salute and downed it , managing to swallow without grimacing . And held her stare , without winking back , till the liquor settled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow with a flourish intended as debonair . " If a girl like you knows what she 's doing in a place like this , you 'll come home with me . If you survey judiciously what 's left of the clientele , I 'm by far the best bet , given the hour and the possibilities . " He bowed again , grinninguntil he realized how muddled it 'd come out , afterwards he forgot to ask just what she 'd heard . But he stood his ground24as she stared at him , neither evaluative nor hostile . Barely curious . He was certain he was n't blushing . She was built pretty small . If she did n't decide soon , he would n't buy her the drink he 'd intended . His credits ledgered , he yawned . " You just do n't fit , " she said , " I bet you never come here . I bet this is the first time you ever came here and now you 're afraid you 'll wake up . Poom ! " She jabbed through an enormous balloon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghoulish pout as it deflated . Curiously long fingernails for such shaggy hair , he thought . " I 'm not afraid . If you think you can wake me up why do n't you try ? " She turned to stare at him but he watched her eyes slip off . He waited till he was sure she 'd forgotten , then tapped her knobby elbow . " I guess I 'm not interested , " she said . " I 'm not selling anything . And certain people spend enough time telling me I do n't have anything anybody wants . " As she sucked her fingernail he wanted to urge her to bite it , clean . " Okay , I 'll come . Promise you wo n't talk too much if I ask you not to . But on the other hand , " and her tongue probed the scaly underside of her nail again , " promiseme you 'll talk all night if I want you to . Or at least put a record on . I 've been getting confused lately . Well , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her drink . " Lead me the way out of here . " Reached for her shoulder bag and slipped off her stool . In the street he asked her name , amazed it was happening so easily . Jessie , for Jessica , which was , nowadays , old-fashioned . " Jessie 's a boy 's name too and that 's why I like it ! " And grinned up at him , thin lips and a tipped nose , quick wrinkle , warm throb in his tight crotch reminded him he 'd forgotten to worry about how well he 'd manage with her , clearly been around. 25A genuine waif , and Laurie gone for a week . Possibilities ? Which did n't emerge . " My first real night downtown , I only just split . Spade cat who fed me out of his own pocket , claimed it was the first time for him it was n't the other way around . If I had any bread he coulda used it , that 's not why he kicked me out . He kicked me out because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him I was colorblind and I showed him , too , all I could , but they just put him too uptight . " " I know the daytime side of that a little bit . I work for the Welfare . The State . " She whistled , then sucked on a loose strand of her shoulder strap as they walked south . " The man with the black book . I seen you all over , uptown . Nobody likes your goodies much . " " Nobody should . " Climbing his stairs he considered how to tell her about Laurie so she 'd have to listen , curious about whatever judgment she 'd make . But he forgot as soon as she dumped her coat on Laurie 's stool . " Is all this really yours ? It 's really  --  and all these books ? And you made the benches ? " He did n't deny it . " And all those paintings ? " " Friends . " Feeling by now it was almost a lie . " All this . So much room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody can get to you . Come here , " she whispered , and after he crossed his room to sit before her on the rocker so she could cradle his head and lose her small fingers in his tangled hair , she rocked and rocked and matched the rhythms of her talk to the chair 's creak . " I never stayed with anybody who had a home before , never . Can you imagine that ? My26stepdaddy kicked me out of Grand Rapids , Michigan , when I was fourteen , and my own kid 's in a home up near Syracuse somewhere . " He let her talk , calculating her changes , desperate to take her . But finally under him , thin bundle , feverish but slippery , eluding his rhythms , he caught a thin hum , monotonic , behind her tight lips as she squirmed . Afterwards she edged onto her side and buried her face in his shoulder . " Keep me covered , " she whispered . " I 'm hell on blankets , I squirm them off and then I wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spasms which hinted at ritual , he kneaded her spiky shoulders and murmured shah shah into her hair , remembered nuzzling into the soft folds of his grandmother 's neck . In the moments she stopped , exhausted , to catch her breath , he mopped her face with the same damp corner of the bedsheet , bullied her into blowing her nose , lit cigarettes for both of them and then finished hers as sobbing took her again , her knees arrowing into his thighs , her back muscles knotted under his fingers . When he guessed she was finally spent he wiped her face dry and kissed the tip of her nose . " I 'm sorry , I know it 's terrible . " " Be quiet . " Gruffly , his fingers working to ease the strained muscles hunching her shoulders . " I just ca n't tell , sometimes when I 'm lucky I get through a whole week of nights but other times  --  " she shrugged . " This week it 's every night so far . " His hands never stopped . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick pain which shifted as he whispered her name , he moved inside her gently , then less gently , his hands digging to reach her through her spare flesh . And took , instead , only her keen , high-pitched hum vibrating like some unmodulatedfrequency in his forehead . He clamped his teeth27closed behind lips pressed into the tiny hollow of her shoulder blade and worked her , doggedly , insistent , finally with abandon , riding a rhythm threatening to split his eardrums . Provoked , her energy rose , sealed him , both sweaty , and rode down with him till his head split and he opened his mouth to gasp and moaned instead . His ears told him he was unrecognizableas his head slumped onto the pillow . He waited till his blood slowed , a long time , before he dared to look at her . She was staring through the curtain at some dim light source , the moon or Anne-Marie 's window where the light was always on . " Hey . " And stroked her arm . She did n't turn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuggled down again : " Do n't forget to cover me up or I 'll freeze you in the morning , my toes go actually blue . " And just before she fell asleep : " I 'll be all right now , I really will , you do n't have to worry . " She woke him again just after dawn . She was n't crying but he took her anyway . Phone jarred him . Stumbled into the kitchen , stubbed his toe on Laurie 's stool and knocked it over , then flinched for the grandmother downstairs , pounding at the pipes . " I promised I 'd call , I did n't mean to wake you . Everything was perfect , your wife 'll be in the Recovery Room for about forty minutes . " He mumbled apologies at the crisp voice , unable to complete a sentence . " Well , I think if you hurried you might make it up here before they bring her back to her room . I 've left word for you to be admitted , you could even see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . I 'm sorry I woke you , but I 've still got my gown on . " Mumbled his thanks . " Everything did go well , as well as we expected . Better . She wo n't have much difficulty healing . But you 'll see28for yourself . " " Thanks , " he managed finally , and groped the receiver back onto its cradle . Three miles uptown swaddled in bandages , flat on a rolling stretcher down a flatly lit hallway , tube beside her dripping liquid into her veins . Thick colorless liquid . Below her stomach , under layers of jellied padding , an angry red gash was trickling blood , held together by clamps which forced a ridgeline of raw flesh . He stumbled back to bed wanting only an hour 's dumb sleep and encounteredher thin warmth , solicitous . Surprisingly they found more than a respite , he smiled at her , tentatively , as they finisheda cigarette . " You 've got to go somewhere . " And kissed his shoulder , quick child 's peck . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And at his wrinkle of surprise : " It 's never hard to guess things like that . Go look at your face in the mirror . " And with her icy feet she pushed him out of bed . " I look like that every morning , " he shouted from the kitchen , " just let me shower and then I 'll buy you breakfast . " Caught himself singing under the spray . Hospital odors would cover any scent on his flesh and besides , Laurie was in no condition to sniff after him . Exactly , he grinned , and so could n't decide why , as he watched her chew soggy forkfuls of scrambled egg , he would n't ask her to stay on . For a few days , at least , she could use the footing . " Where will you go ? " Shrugged , sipping lukewarm coffee , staring past him at the empty counter . " Uptown . Left my clothes with a friend . " " And then ? " " Oh , I du n no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , there 's plenty of floors around . I 'll think about it later . " Implyinghe was a nuisance , put up or shut up . But staring at her vacant frown he decided she 'd intended nothing , had already consigned him . He kissed her forehead for goodbye on the subway steps and watched her wander up the avenue , school-29girl ankles . Only two stops uptown he was regretting letting her go , twisting her under him as the car lurched and bucked , why sleep alone ? Sallow in coarse cotton , her hand limp in his , he watched Laurie 's eyelids quiver . " She 'll be coming round soon , " the nurse whispered . " It all went very well . She came out of it once when they transferred her and she called for you , but it was only for a second and then she dropped right off again . " You make sure everybody pays , do n't you ? Nodded his thanks , never antagonize nurses . When Laurie started to whimper he murmured her name ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to smile and her dry lips cracked as they parted , so he sponged first her lips and then her forehead with square gauze pads soaking in an aluminumtray whose kidney shape offended him . " It hurts ! Oh god it hurts so much ! " Hours she whimpered and sobbed , drifting toward consciousness where the pain was too searing to be borne . They let him stay till late into the evening , most of her normal color had returned but the anesthetic had ebbed , leaving her defenseless . She soaked his handkerchief . He remembered that the bedsheet corner might still be damp . " I 'm such a coward , I know , but I just ca n't stand it ! " Helpless , he finally shuffled out to beg . " Ca n't you give her something ? " Watched the needlepoint plunge into her thigh , shivered as the plunger jammed some ten hours ' sleep into her . When she went under , old lady 's wheeze like his grandmother 's , he kissed her glassy cheek and tiptoed away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , in case Laurie 's pain made her short-tempered . Walked all the way home to numb himself , his mind closed to everything except traffic sounds and the first six bars of " Bye Bye Blackbird , " he kept whistling variations as he trudged downtown . By morning her smells30were faint on his sheets , only the kitten he rescued , cringing in an overcrowded cage , preserved her . He swore to one of the hags who ran the shop that he 'd have it altered as soon as it reached its doubtful maturity , a promise he figured he 'd enjoy breaking , and then fed it and soothed its wobblings through the ten days Laurie took to learn the limits of her wound . When he finally brought Laurie home , the kitten had mastered its box , could locate its food and hide successfully in all their cupboards and closets . Vulnerable tortoise-shell , uncertain markings , spontaneous legs and tail , bizarre navigationand a consistently cold nose which homed on sensitive flesh . It mewed plaintively as he set Laurie down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He cupped a hand under its thin belly and plopped it , trembling , into Laurie 's lap . She cried as she cuddled it . Tunneling back into bed after Laurie 's phone call , he wondered why they had n't considered it more of an evil omen when Tattoo died . Maybe Laurie never realized how much I meant her for exorcism . Laurie was so positive the old hag downstairs had poisoned her , but that 's crazy , she 'd have had to sneak up here to feed her and we always keep the door locked . Maybe Laurie thinks she lured Tattoo down by the fire escape ? You do n't have to imagine conspiracies , he chided Laurie , there 's enough real ones going on in this building . He fell asleep worrying whether Sal was working day shift again . SAL Evans was on the desk when Jones and Dolan brought him in . " Hello , Dutch , " I says . I decided to book him myself as soon as I seen his face . Every cop knows the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough front knowing that their31fancy lawyer , the one who they pay a fat monthly retainer , is due any minute to bail them out and put together a story that 'll stand up in court . We 're too busy to be perfect , if you got enough money you can probably beat us . But nobody showed up to bail him out , you might buy him a drink at Tony 's or a cup of coffee at the club , but that do n't make him part of the neighborhood when it comes to bail . Which woulda been steep , anyway , I could n't list him for less than manslaughter and even then I was taking a chance . Angie thinks I always figure the percentages before I stick my neck out , but how often does one of your own wind up on the wrong side of the cage ? The Lieutenant would n't pass it , worried we 'd get accused of playing soft with our own . " We 'll have a goddam delegation sitting in on our steps as soon as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I growled but it would n't wash . " List him for second degree , till we see what turns up , " the Lieutenant said , he 's a political appointment with ambitions , plays everything tight and keeps his fingers crossed . So I listed him for second degree , but nothing turned up , nothing connected the two of them except the fact that she lived upstairs , he did n't even know her name ! Lissen , if I found something I sure as hell mighta salted it away , difference of six to ten years , depending on probation , which he wo n't get , he coulda been out of the state before we found her but he never tried to get away . Those kids of hers woulda sat there all day , too dumb to cry . Of all the goddam people to pick ! You 're gon na knock one of them off at least pick somebody useful . We got plenty down here could stand getting rid of , each cop has his own list . But a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the point , even if she was a nigger ? " Now look , Dutch , " I told him , I hadda steady his elbow to guide him into the back room , " the main thing you got ta understand is that you got a long pull ahead of you , lotta orders to take , lotta places to go , lotta people taking your picture and your fingerprints and your32blood , it makes for confusion . You 're gon na be in a long time and rule number one is that nobody 's in a hurry , just relax every chance you get . " Kept staring at his hands . I asked if he was hungry but he did n't answer . I spoon-fed him some soup anyway , after he wiped his chin he kept opening his mouth like a fish . He already had that smell they get . " You wan na see a priest , Dutch ? We can get Father Angelo down here inside a half hour . Or anybody else you want . " Hadda shut the cage on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench , nodding his head . An hour later he was asleep in the same position , his chin wedged into his chest . So when I finally got some free time to see the Counselor , I guess I poured it on a little . " Look , with all due respect for the fact that it ai n't my business and I 'm taking a chance just to mention it to you , I would n't leave a guy like that for Legal Aid to represent . " " We 'll take up a collection , " the Counselor rumbled . " I 'm sure he was known and loved throughout the neighborhood . " " For Chrissake , " I mumbled , I 'd never had much respect for the Counselor 's shrewdness , " I 'm not talking about charity . I 'm trying to imagine what a guy like that knows . He 's already half outa his head , suppose he gets resentful and his tongue works loose , who shuts him up ? I ca n't guarantee it , totally depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some job he was used on , uptown or downtown , if the wrong sergeant 's on the desk the newspapers got another story . Now I 'll admit I do n't keep my ear so close to the ground any more , but even I know that Parisi used him on some uptown runs , and Freddie and the Duke picked him up for lots of small jobs . If I know that much , he must be a gold mine . And you 're letting him sit there , maybe he 's stewing because nobody cares whether he 's still alive , and he 's got enough information floating around in his head to convict half the neighborhood . Suppose he makes a deal ? We do n't really want him , we 'll probably let him plead to manslaughter to33save us a trial , if he starts feeding us information we might drop all his charges . Why take the chance ? Send one of your new college boys to bail him out , prepare a decent case . The DA do n't have a scrap of motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counselor 's a cornball , rotates his White Owl like it was Havana , stares at the ash like he was judging pearls till it falls off the tip from its own weight . " Sal , you 're right , it makes sense . I 'll look into it . And I want you to know I appreciate a man on the force who still cares about the old neighborhood . And keeps his eyes open . " " Think nothing of it , Counselor , " I said , " but I got ta be going , I 'm overdue on the desk and I never signed out . " And got the hell outa his office before he tried to hand me a couple of bills he looked ready to peel off Just a token of my esteem , he 'd probably say . If I depended on guys like the Counselor I 'd be pounding pavements out in Queens . When they brought Dutch into the precinct , I knew it was up to me to help him out , he could n't do nothing for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture somebody dug up outa some city file , he did n't even recognize her . Dolan questioned her kids , only thing he got outa them was they thought Dutch was the exterminator ! The goddam exterminator comes twice a year to buildings like that , three times if they 're really lucky . But you know how it is , the exterminator 's white , and Dutch 's white , we all look alike to them. 34Io:3o-12:oo Disturbance at the nurses ' desk spilled him up out of the chopapril 7 , 1965 of the Chesapeake Bay . Squat Puerto Rican woman , plaits looped and pinned into coils at the nape of her neck , screamed as she battled a trio of nurses wedging her away from the elevators . Two orderlies raced across the cracked concrete floor , pinned her arms , then frog-marched her down a hallway . Matto yawned into the back of his hand , his canvas deck chair creaking , its cloth bleached white from sun and salt spray , stitching already powder in half the tucks . Everything 's rotting , Balzano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good woman on board for a month of mending . Or a weary sailor with a nimble thimble . The girl straddled Balzano , stomach and hips pumping against the bright blue of his saddle-stitched trousers . His thick fingers squeezed her buttocks , each cheek firmly gripped and then sponged , creased , kneaded , drawn taut and released . Wind stirred her short blond hair . The cone of her right breast squashed against Balzano 's checked sportshirt as her narrowed eyes stared at Matto . Who had come up from the cabin to find them , balanced on the stern swivel chair , the girl 's head draped over Balzano 's left shoulder , her eyes slitted and her tongue 's tip sliding across her protruding front teeth as she breathed in slow , sucking gasps . He watched until her eyes widened . In a flat , casual tone : " Hey , who 's that ? " Balzano twisted , spilling her sideways but pinning her left leg and thigh and steadying her ass with his big hands so he stayed inside her . Matto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing .

" " So stay down below . " A satisfied grunt and Matto , as he turned , saw hairy hands twisting the girl back over him , breasts swaying as she reared , suspended , then wriggled and sank down . Matto , straining to see , caught her eyes slit and unfocus , tongue beginning to squirm across her outcrop of teeth , then he was too far down the hatchway , ridge of deck floor cut off his view . He shuffled across the damp cabin floor to the engine hatch , watched the generator throwing sparks without worrying any more whether the main lines would short before they reached the coast , and jerked off , letting his jit spatter the water-soaked walls and join the brine in the washways . As he got close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and worked his tongue over the cutting edges of his teeth , hearing her flat voice call him sugar like the girls in Luzon . Balzano let him alone till evening . Balzano threw private parties maybe four times a season . After the ' 48 summer he always took Matto , the girls cooked and Balzano mixed his own drinks , with no fish to prepare for market it was always an easy weekend . Two girls , usually ; Balzano could afford to pamper himself , and for the girls it was almost a vacation , two nights on the open sea , $50 a weekend plus eats and drinks and a good sunburn . They teetered on board in white slacks and heavy gray sweatshirts , 36slept on deck unless the Carolina squalls caught them , and changed into bikinis after Saturday morning breakfast . Matto stayed below deck , washed the dishes , nursed the engine , and made the same slow run through the channel and out to weigh anchor some thirty miles northeast of the Cape , the fishing fleets headed south and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windburned and parched by Saturday sunset , so Matto served as a stolid fourth for rummy ; never mix women and poker , Balzano had warned him on Luzon . Drugged by the sun and the salt which caked their lips and the fading lines of their eye makeup , their skins burning under heavy sweatshirts and coarse blankets , the girls yawned over their highballs , blinked in the flickering light of the Coleman lantern , smiled hazily at Matto , called him sweetie and lamb , patted his forearm and shoulder and dropped swiftly into sleep . Balzano snored , his massive head propped against the liquor cabinet . Once , although Matto never remembered , Balzano sent him a girl who slipped down the narrow hatchway ladder to Matto 's post at the wheel . " Gus says I should talk to you . " Matto grunted , hands clenched on the spokes though her anchor was forty feet down , dragging rock . Beneath her top the girl was built small , Matto watched them quiver as she smoothed the wet lengths of her hair into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairs of his right forearm . " So ? " she said . " Gus is a good guy . I 'm working for him . " Matto 's left hand slid off the wheel , thinking he heard Gus 's bulk squeaking the springs of his swivel chair . Elastic webbing molding her suit37taut across her hips was beginning to dry but her flanks were still wet . Matto traced the line of her thigh to the curls of hair escaping from the damp V her suit pressed into her crotch . Sea spray , still moist on her knees and calves , blotted his fresh white ducks as she leaned closer to him . " Sure Uncle Gus is a good guy . That 's why he sent me down here . He do n't feel good about you being left out of the party . Tell him he can afford to relax a little , Uncle Gus says . Tell him he 's off duty from now on , his working day 's over .

I am so fed up with war stories , I swear to God if I hear another one I 'll jump overboard and swim back to shore . " Matto could 've kept his mouth shut . The girl did n't require conversation , and Uncle Gus had slipped her an extra $20 hinting that Matto might still be virgin . But instead he shook his head . " I do n't talk about the war . Ever . I do n't talk about nothing . They just want me to stand around and do things for them . " The girl stopped laughing when she saw his face and for more than ten minutes she watched his Adam 's apple bob as he swallowed phlegm . Her fault , she decided . Some guys had memories they still could n't deal with . Balzano decided she actually fell for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue , bashful face as he stared at the sea . " C'm on , " she whispered finally and slipped her arm around his waist . " I 'm getting cold , and afterwards for dinner I 'll make you some38of my special fish soup , you 'll feel a whole lot better . " But afterwards they fell asleep beneath heavy wool blankets . The girl forgot her soup because Matto handled her too roughly , and Matto snored through sunset . Sprawled flat on the bow , toes of his sneakers wedged under a coil of flaking rope , Matto lets the sun bake him , dozes . Beneath his stomach he can feel the whunk as the bow takes the chop . " Matto . " The vaulted ceiling echoes it . " Matto ! " Peremptory . Matto almost wakes , rush of dirty light which crumbles sea and horizon , spirals his stomach upward . But twisting his shoulder into the slatted wooden bench he grunts , finds the boat again , skims at water level , spray blinding him , pressure constricting his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind roars in his ears , his hair is plastered to his forehead , the clot in his chest stirs , unknots , and dissolves through his stomach , down into his bowels coarses a hot flow that warms his thighs and calves before streaming into the coil of rope . A gull eases onto a whitecap , wings braked like flaps , claws extended to rinse beneath the chop . Somersaults , and its head and neck plunge , reappear , no fish wriggling in its beak . The gull wheels upward , folding its leg to its slicked white breast , shrill hoarse cries . " Matto . " Crisp , angry . " Matto ! " Matto wakes . His temples throb . Dirty light-globes sway on quivering chains from the vaulted ceiling , and stretched into rows of benches , too many bent yellow necks. 39 " Matto ! Last call ! " " Yes . Here . Here . " His hands lock , brace against bench back . His good leg slides , stiffens , and straightens to jack up the other . As his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right toe and half shuffles , half drags , into the aisle . Waiting rows blur as he edges past , wobbly on sloping floor to the white-coated black orderly at the barrier . " You Matto ? " " Yeah . " " You deaf ? Called your name seven times ! " " I fell asleep . I got up at six  --  to come here . " " Yeah ? Well I got up at five , buddy , same as every morning , and I 'll be here long after you 're gone , so do n't sweat it . This is people 's medicine , buddy , be thankful it 's here at all ! " Bloodshot behind his owlish horn rims , his eyes already registered Matto 's limp and the dark stain spreading from Matto 's crotch across his right pants leg . Matto traced the slants and curls of writing he thought spelled his name on the manila folder . " They fix up my knee today ? " Through the barrier gate into the chair , witness chair , orderly filling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother to nod . " Roll up your right pants leg . How come you wet yourself ? " Matto 's cuff catches on a roll of flesh , a flicker of pain jabs into his bulbous knee . He forces the fraying trouser edges over the hump of swollen knee and up his thigh , then stares at the40stain matting his right leg , trousers clammy , soggy underwear sticking to his balls . " I was asleep . " And tries to shrug . " You just could n't hold it . Maybe you had a nice dream . " Orderly 's eyes catch the flush creeping up Matto 's neck . " Forget it . They 'll clean you up , upstairs . Let 's see that knee . " Matto looked , too . White crown of flesh , impacted mass of fluid shifting beneath taut skin . Angry flush . Matto braced the cap with his thumbs and flexed the lower leg . The cap 's slide was barely visible , a crease beneath thick fluids . The orderly nodded as Matto eased his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his folder . " Looks bad . " A grudged respect . " How 'd you do it ? " Hesitated , licked his lips . " Bus door  --  close on me . I run for the bus , see it halfway down the block . Driver do n't see me . One foot on the step , door close  --  whoosh ! " Collapsing motion with both hands , concertina pushed inwards . " I fall backwards . Catch this one , " tapping the thigh of his bad leg , " underneath me . " Just make up a story , tell them anything , they 're too busy to give a damn , the doctor said . Freddie and Morello took him to somebody who would n't ask questions , not that they had any real worries . Surplus ammo , cartridge cases , packed in regulation U.S. Army boxes . Besides he could n't read . " Hey Dutch , you wan na make ten bucks , we need a hand shifting some stuff tomorrow . " Rented truck in a Queens driveway , those black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Case of grenades balanced on his shoulder , packed in straw like tropical fruit , pins securely scaled , he twists his ankle on a loose slab of paving that Freddie is always promising to fix41because his wife hates the lurch when she 's backing her Pontiac out of the garage , she 's always certain she 's got another flat . Matto lost his balance but fell shielding the case , which slid off his right shoulder and crushed the knee already bent beneath him . " He should 've dropped the case , " Freddie said afterwards , " he did n't have a clue what was inside , what 'd he think he was saving ? We never told him he was carrying perfume . Or eggs . Worst thing coulda happened , the case would split and he 'd see a coupla grenades . Big deal . " They figured he was okay till they watched him limp to the truck , he could n't sit with his knee bent , they moved over to give him leg room . Doctor shook his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These should bring it down a little . But I think you shattered part of the kneecap . Stay off it . When the swelling goes down , go to the clinic and get it X-rayed . They 'll do it for nothing . I 'd have to charge you . " By rights they should 've put him into a hospital , Freddie knew what clinics are like . A week in semi-private , three meals a day , clean sheets , not to mention the nurses , would 've given Matto his first real vacation , not counting the Army . But he was always banging himself up , Freddie figured , never seen him when he was n't limping . If he'da just let the case drop instead of trying to play hero , he 'd be okay . Or at least , no worse than usual . Which , Freddie figured , was n't worth that much , certainly not two weeks in a hospital . So Freddie forced an extra $ro on Matto before they dropped him off , Morello scowled as he watched Matto drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think there 's a chance he 'll open his mouth ? " Freddie laughed , stuffing his billfold back into his42wallet pocket . " Who 's he gon na talk to ? Nobody knows he 's alive . " The orderly stares . Matto decides he 's said enough but still stares at his folder . " What does it say there , for my birthday ? " " August 28 , 1914. " " 1914 . " Matto mumbles the year again , pretending to subtract . " So if I was born in 1914  --  " " That makes you fifty-one . Next August you 'll be fifty-two . " The orderly waited , without fidgeting , Matto 's file open beneath his knuckles , watching Matto trying to count to fifty-one on his fingers . Thinking a pile of toothpicks might be more useful , he actually reached into his desk drawer to see how full his toothpick box was . " Leroy . " His hand hesitated , caressed the cold drawer knob . His name in her mouth always demanded more than apology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't trust them alone for one minute ! More controlled than the face from whose cheeks powder never quite concealed the flush , her voice pursued its advantage . " After six months in this department , you 're still not aware that the information recorded in in-take files is never divulged to clients ? " Reluctantly he granted her a marginal withdrawal , fractional nod of his set jaw and chin . " I 'm aware . " " Well ? " Adamant . Pulse in the ridge of skin covering her high cheekbones registered her tension . Was n't she destined for more than this interminable squabbling with the colored help ? She forced herself to hold his look . He 's got such hate for me , he 'd like to kill me . Or worse . Whenever you catch them , they defend43themselves with insolence . " It does n't matter , " he said finally , flat tone , no hint of mollification . " He ca n't read . " " Then why is his file displayed so conveniently in front of him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week . When I wangled that pass which got me into the Tombs , the only thing he wanted to know was : " Did they find out ? " I did n't have to lie , then . As far as I knew they hadn't. re Alonzo Cobb  --  Probation Dept forwarded a copy of their report and recommendations . Looks bad . Too many convictions , he was still on probation from the last one . I spotted him the first time I visited their apartment , asked him to walk me to the corner just as I was leaving , casually , but in front of the mother so he could n't refuse . " You 're on the needle , are n't you ? " He was sixteen then , he glowered at me . " It 's that plain ? You do n't look like you been around much . " I wanted him to talk so I swallowed my morsel of pride and nodded . " You gon na tell my folks ? " He was waiting at home my next two visits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him when I 'd come . By not betraying him I got sucked in . His next arrest I lived on the phone ; to the family , the precinct , Legal Aid , I abandoned the rest of my caseload . " It 'll kill my old man , it 'll just finish him off for good . " From Probation Dept 's report on Alonzo Cobb  --  Family seems a cut above average for that neighborhood , but father 's disability has limited family 's income , means , mobility , and contacts . Father seems to have been a preacher of some considerable reputation in neighborhood , is still an impressivefigure in spite of his paralysis , which is severe . Mother says he is occasionally transported to his old church to give a guest sermon . Seems the nature of those type of churches45not to make any arrangements for their pastors . Mother said they took up a collection which only paid his hospital bill . The first time I met the father I almost bowed , he seemed regal in his wheelchair , African blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble you , sir , " I said , wishing I could disappear . " You 've got a job to do , young man , " he rumbled , " get on with it . Pride 's a luxury for a man in my position . I 'm thankful to the good Lord my head 's still clear and my voice 's still strong . " His youngest son was his most bitter affliction ; they dropped their voices as if softness excluded him , impassive , rocking on the radiator , while they begged me to concoct an administrative solution  --  a change of schools , a job-training program , anything that would set him back on the right path . " I suppose in your line of work you hear too many parents saying this , but I just ca n't believe I 've brought my son up to be a common thief . " Alonzo rode the radiator , bobbing his head . " He 's not a common thief , he 's just a kid with two busts for stealing . Every kid steals , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole plenty when I was a kid . " And tried to grin . " How much harder you think it would be , " I asked Alonzo once , " if they knew you were a junkie and had to think about you as a junkie instead of a thief , like your father says ? You really think it 'd be that much harder for them ? " Alonzo did n't react , hands shoved deep into his slash pockets , waited a half block before answering . I knew he 'd heard . " I went to one of my daddy 's sermons about three years ago . The last sermon I ever heard . Naturally he was talking about the needle . Know what he called us ? Vermin . Said we was46worse than the rats whose bites killed little thumb-sucking babies . Said we was the worst of the plagues which the Lord Almighty had sent down to cleanse the black community , worse than locusts , worse than boils , worse even than the destruction of all the first-born because we were already zombies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just how do you think he 's gon na take the good news that one of them vermin been living in his house the past sixteen years ? " From Probation Dept 's report on Alonzo Cobb  --  Accused is sullen , noncommunicative , often hostile in direct examinationand conversation . Volunteers nothing , often seeks to evade even sympathetic questioning . Present attitude and past record seem to indicate a chronic recidivist , a pattern which school records , attempts at vocational guidance , and previous probationary experience seem to bear out . Accused has never evidenced a coherent and lasting interest in anything , has never held a job , has no career goals , no longstandingfriends or older acquaintances he respects in the community . I finally spotted the lawyer I 'd spent those two days on the phone with , kid just out of Brooklyn Law , younger than his voice , an accountant 's son with a thin-lapeled continental-style suit which hung , on him , as if it were waiting for his confidence to expand in order to inhabit it . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blinked , nervously shuffling a scrambled sheaf of arrest sheets . " So you 're the one 's been breaking my ear for two days ! Boy , I could n't get any other work done , my supervisor said to tell you Legal Aid is not DW 's law service . When you want individual attention you got ta hire somebody . " Said with no passion , already47blinking at the overhead lights , the rows of uniformed and plainclothes cops , the trio of Assistant DA 's . I was temptedto grab his thin lapels and shove my chin into his face . " You can tell your supervisor to shove it up his ass , " I growled . " And I 'll put that in writing , on whatever forms he wants . Now look , concentrate for a minute . They got Alonzo on Assault on a Police Officer , Possession and Use of heroin , Breaking and Entering , Possession of Stolen Property . The only charge they can actually prove is the last one , the other three are bullshit , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip when he came through the door , no warrant was ever issued , the whole bust was illegal . All they found was a rusty needle and an empty cartridge , they never even got it lab-tested , for all they knew he was diabetic and the kit was . for insulin . " He rolled his eyes . " Oh , come on , " he said . " We know the kid 's an addict . " I grabbed his shoulder and shook him , hard , wanting to rant my fist through his teeth , cause him expensive bridgework take him years to pay off ashamed to open his mouth even to grin at superiors . " You come on , you chicken-shit son of a bitch . This is an adversary proceeding and you are the fucking defense lawyer , not the goddam prosecution . You sound like the DA , buddy , he assumes guilt , you assume innocence . You read his record , legally he is not an addict , if there was a lawyer defending Alonzo instead of a clay pigeon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuff in the cartridge was smack ! And they ca n't do it . They ca n't prove use , either ; all they got is a small collection of old hash marks on his right arm . And for the Assault charge they 'll have to stick the cop on the stand , DA 's office does n't like convictions on one cop 's testimony . All you have to do is open your mouth and pretend you're48about to make a fight and they 'll drop those charges before you finish your first sentence . It wo n't cost you anything to act like a lawyer for a change , instead of a eunuch ! " Just kept blinking at me , smoothed his lapel after I let go his jacket . At least he understood I was desperate . I never saw him in conference with the Assistant DA , but when he waggled me over he seemed almost pleased . " Okay , we got a deal . But it 's not on the property rap , DA would n't settle for that . Wants another Breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also some question of insurance . Most he 'll do is drop the other three for Breaking and Entering . " From Probation Dept 's report on Alonzo Cobb  --  Parents professed ignorance as to Accused 's status as addict . Mother in particular swore her son " never touched the needle . " Father kept issuing flat denials , implied either worker or record was mistaken . Both parents admitted knowledge of their son 's record of theft , etc. , but both denied any knowledge of what the thefts might have been for . Both denied Accused spent any time in Rhb Ward , though Accused 's record shows three two-week periods spent specifically in Rehabilitation . Worker tried to convince both parents that it was to their advantage , as well as their son 's , to cooperate , since the final Probation Report , which would affect the sentencing , would reflect their attitudes . Neither parent changed their story . They both insisted , throughout the interview , that their son could not possibly be an addict . " What do you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on our asses , our backs propped up against a concrete playground wall . Alonzo was waiting out a fouron-fourgame , the losers would drop a man , and me  --  I was49taking my ease . A hot Thursday in July , asphalt spongy underfoot , only in uptown is basketball played in 9o  --  weather . I 'd sprung Alonzo from home and I was n't in any hurry to get to my next visit . " Whatta you mean ? " he said finally . " What I said . You ever think about getting clear of all this and doing something  --  something that 's maybe very different but something you really want to do ? " He snickered . I did n't blame him . " You mean , like rob a bank , get enough to livethe rest of my life on ? " Igrinned . " Yeah , something like that . " We both watched a rebound clear and the ball passed out and then in to the big center , who faked left , faked right , started a dribble off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faked a jumper , then took it . The ball bounced high off the front rim , fell away . We 'd both been certain he 'd miss it . " You know what I 'd really like to do ? " He was mumbling , I had to strain to hear him . " I 'd like to get the hell outa here , get to one of the islands , St. Kitts or St. Thomas , get me something good going there and never have to think about this place again . " I waited through three quick baskets . " By this place you mean this country ? " Snorted . " I ai n't even seen this country . I ai n't even seen this city , ' cept for a little bit of the Bronx and uptown and the East River Drive when they took me to Rehab . I do n't expect to see much more , either , ' less they send me upstate to the big pen . Most of my traveling the next dozen years or so be on the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bailiff called his case in a jumble of words which somehow both the cop next to Alonzo and the Legal Aid lawyer deciphered , the cop shoved Alonzo onto his feet and pointed him in the direction of the bench and the lawyer , semaphoring his arrest sheets . Before50Alonzo had reached the stand the lawyer was already explaining his guilty plea ; in the pause after the Judge asked the DA " whether the People found that plea acceptable " I held my breath , expecting a double-cross . " Stand up straight there , you ! " the Judge barked at Alonzo . " And get your hands out of your pockets , nobody slouches in my courtroom ! " Once the Assistant DA accepted the plea it was all over , the Judge set May 2 for sentencing . I watched Alonzo stumble back through the pen to disappear behind the wood paneled doors which led to the temporary cages and finally to the Tombs . He did n't turn around . The most I could do now was send his mother a note listing visiting hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside my responsibility . I sent the whole file in for transfer to another section without checking with Carson. 51relay morning In the A &; P to do Laurie 's shopping , he realized he 'd madeJuly 10 , 1965 no list , bumped into Angie 's cart in the cereal aisle , dazed at his possibilities . Have you been watching me bumbling through this maze ? " Good morning . " And grinned . " You know you look just as good in the daylight . In fact better . More tempting . " She poked a stubby finger at him . " You watch your mouth or I 'll report you to the manager . " He looks youngest in the mornings , lean , unbutton his shirt to make him shiver under my fingers . I went up on the roof with a robe loose over my nightgown and he was over by the chimneys , gloomy , waiting for sunrise but he could hardly keep his eyes open . When he cupped his hands to light my cigarette I smelled his skin and knew I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't sleep I blamed myself . I never imagined he went looking for it like some alleycat , sniffing . He walked the streets trying to tell himself how important it was to be alive , collecting his little nighttime vignettes for buttress . When he jarred me awake , deliberately as often as not , climbing into bed sometimeslong after dawn , I could always feel his contempt . While the real world uncoiled before him , all I chose was my sleep . " I do n't like leaving Nikky alone , she wakes up so scared sometimes she 'd scream herself into hysterics if I was n't there . But it 's so goddam hot in my place ! Even with those two window fans Sal rigged up . At least you 're in the front of the building , you get the breeze off the river . " " When it comes . " Watching the flimsy collar of her nightgownride up to brush her neck as she turned from the parapet to grind out her cigarette . " Even then it 's just as hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh as she brushed past him on the stairs , nothing he remembered about the building 's judgments of her added up to prohibition . " Sometimes when it 's hot like this I walk all night , down to the Battery , past the ferry slips to the docks , up to the Fish Market , then through the projects and Chinatown . Sometimes I play a game , I count everybody I meet and once I pass twenty-five I can go home . Except I never count cops . Does n't seem fair . " Hesitant to risk touch , but not apprehensive , certain he sniffed her heat . " How 'd you meet Sal ? " ANGIE I almost laughed . Everybody knew Sal stayed with me , but he had to whisper , confidential , like he 'd already told me the story of his life . So I said , " He picked me up for soliciting and after I gave him a free sample he decided it 'd be cheaper in the long run not to turn me in . " He yawned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you expect , the story of my life at four in the morning ? " " Why not ? " he said . " You know a better time ? " His shirt was open enough to see there was n't any hair on his chest , no bush like Sal 's . But lean , the skin stretched tight so you could see the outlines of bone . I shrugged my shoulders and moved closer , he had enough reasons to be shy and I was n't in any hurry , Nikky never wakes up till eight . " It 's sure as hell a long story , " I said , just to warn him -- you only moved in here two , three years ago , you do n't know the neighborhood . I grew up here and moved away and came back with a kid and no marriage certificate , they 're still scared of me so they only call Nikky a bastard behind my back . And her back . It was only after the attacks started I realized how much they freeze me out . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third girl he got to . I never go to the laundromat that late but Nikky needed54a uniform I was too lazy to wash by hand so I figured what the hell , get a whole load done . It was pretty clear she needed to talk , she could n't stop crying . After I loaded up three machines and put my bleach in I sat down beside her , she was n't more than twenty-five . She always let her kid downstairs to play on the sidewalk in front of the building , hanging halfway out her window like I watch Nikky . What happened to her was a friend called up so she spent twenty minutes gabbing . As soon as she put the phone down she had a premonition , craned her head out the window and could n't find her so she raced downstairs and there was her little girl whimpering on the first floor landing , her panties off and her dress stained . Six and a half , a year older than Nikky was then , the cops said he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just coaxed them into a corner , got their panties off and came between their legs ; he got into a couple of the older ones enough to make them bleed . I went crazy . Nikky was five minutes late coming home from school I was already on the phone to the precinct , once she forgot to walk home with Toni and Sandra and I grabbed her wrists so hard to shake her my fingers left deep red gouges in her skin . The old people tried to shush me , clucking like chickens , why could n't I keep my mouth shut ? " Do n't worry , Gina , the police 'll get him . " Three quiet weeks and then three more attacks in the same block , one in Blumenthal 's building with those big fluorescent lights . Everywhere I went people tried to shut me up . " What can we do ? " they wanted to know . He hadda be from the neighborhood . Little girls all over the city , why else come back to the same three blocks ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a stupid detective to butter me up , fat pig of an Irishman thought he was hot shit with women , would n't keep his hands off me till I slapped him . Then he pretended to take down everything I said , gave me his personal phone number , just what I wanted . I stewed for two days , called the precinct back and55told them they did n't come up with the guy in a week I 'd talk to the papers about the kind of detectives they sent out to molest defenseless mothers . That 's when they sent Sal . He did n't take any notes and he let me talk and he kept his hands on the table , but I was n't very impressed . First thing he tells me after I 've shot my mouth off is they 've known for weeks it 's some guy from the neighborhood but they ca n't find him . I laughed in his face . " Bullshit , Sergeant , I been around too long to believe you guys could n't get him if you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his time , I remembernoticing right away how carefully he follows your talk , you can watch him listening . But I did n't believe him . " Lissen , " he said finally , " we want that guy inside , one of these days he 's gon na pick on the wrong little girl and I 'm out on Flushing Bay . We ca n't find him . Everybody 's clammed up on us . " He was right . " Gina , " they told me , " how can we say anything , he 's one of ours ! " The same rules they 'd always understood . And what about the little girls he gets in the hallways , I screamed , they 're not ours ? They 're orphans ? " It 's a sickness , Gina , a sickness . It 's not his fault . " Like cancer . They could n't say the name . Whisper a prayer on Sunday and maybe it 'll go away , maybe everything bad will go away , hold your breath and cross yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? If he 's sick the cops 'll get him committed , I shouted , some kind of mental hospital 's what he needs . You 're protecting a monster , I yelled at them . Nobody 's safe , how do you know he wo n't try to shove it into your granddaughter ? " He wo n't touch her , he promised ! " Covered her mouth with her hand but not quick enough . If he ever gets to my daughter , I told her , you better watch your kid like a hawk because I 'll get to her , I 'll fix her face so good you 'll have to make her a nun because no man 'll look at her without shivering . After the last attack I marched down to Tony 's on a Friday afternoon , Sal told me that 's when the Counselor 's boys56give out the payroll . Lissen , I told them , if all the mothers in this neighborhood were crazy enough to let it get this far , I ai n't crazy enough to let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't gon na be ruined on account of you . If I do n't find out in two days who he is , me and however many mothers I can find who care more about their kids than about this fucking neighborhood are gon na parade up and down Grand Street with signs saying STOP PROTECTING SEX PERVERTS ! LET OUR DAUGHTERS GROW UP NORMAL ! Even if I 'm the only one picketing , the papers will still show up , and I 'll give them the names of everybody in this goddam neighborhood who wo n't open their mouths  --  including the Counselor . I'l1 bust this neighborhood wide open ! You take your choice ! Tony told me months later that I was screaming . All I rememberis the hum from a bad neon connection over Tony 's mirror when Ifinished , and a hand catching my elbow to steady me , gently , when I tripped over somebody 's big feet on my way out . Three hours later I found a note in my mailbox . Just his name . Typewritten . When I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else a way to shut me up for a while . But they put a tail on him anyway , and four days later they caught him trying to get a little girl into Bernardi 's alley behind the bakery . A couple mothers thanked me , that 's all . The rest of the neighborhood hated my guts . I even got those chickenshit phone calls that wake you up in the middle of the night , they let you hear their breathing but they 're too scared to say anything . Sal told me a long time later he put a twenty-four-hour watch on me , the word around the neighborhood was I hadda be taught a lesson . He even told the Counselor to lay off me , the Counselorkidded him for falling in love at his age and Sal said he just stuck his lower lip out , trying to play tough , while all the time he could feel the back of his neck burning under his heavy collar . He 'd been around plenty after his wife ran off but he never tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed bumping into his big coat swinging in the hallway , he wrapped his fingers clear around his coffee cup . So one morning after I got Nikky off to school I leaned over his shoulder to pour his second cup of coffee like I always did , but when I set the pot down I put my hand on his neck . He was n't slow . They caught the guy four years ago this JuneLater the kid would acquire , untransformed , Sal 's habit of nodding comprehension . Now as Angelina rambled he stared carefully at her eyes , avoiding her body , frowned at the roof 's crumpling tar covering when he guessed his attention imposing on her narrative . As her eyes fixed and then unfocused he imagined them rolling up toward her drooping lids as she squirmed beneath him . Steamy bedroom , too many drapes and curtains , they never open their windows . Sal 's lair ? Maybe the kid pads in to punch two lumps under the blankets , giggle good morning . He grinned , unexpected benefit from Laurie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building 's gossipy women . " It 's late . Nikky 'll be up soon . " She sounded tired , was it dismissal or a search for a cigarette that sent her right hand probing her robe pocket ? " Want one of mine ? They 're French , they 're very strong . They 're not really French , but they taste like the French ones . Try one . " As she hesitated , he wedged the pack out of his shirt pocket , brushed her arm in offer , surprised at the fatigue in his tone . She let herself momentarily encircle his fingers , deciding he was n't so scrawny after all . " Strong ? Jesus , they 're worse than cigars ! " Fit of coughing exaggerated long after the tickle in her throat had subsided , she flicked the cigarette over the parapet , shower of sparks they both traced , cradled his forearm to steady herself . " Thanks . " Her hair grazed his cheek , her58weight into the arc his arms completed when they took her shoulders . Held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , but staring down into her face he saw nothing to make him hesitate . Perhaps he felt slightly cheated . " We should go downstairs , " she whispered into his neck . They disengaged , walked to the stairwell , she did n't trouble to take his hand . " I got neighbors so nosy they even stop watching television when I have visitors . No use giving them more ammunition . " Downstairs he followed her through a hallway cluttered with coats and Nikky 's toys and tricycle to her bedroom , where she grinned up at him , accomplices . " I never thought , all the times I seen you on the stoop or down at Rocco 's , that we 'd wind up in here . Did you ? Ever ? " He admitted both that he had n't and that their pairing was , in some unspecifiable way , funny ; chuckling , he stripped off his clothes , realizing he 'd had no time to worry himself about whether he 'd fail her and now he was already aroused , her plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rumpled sheets . Afterwards , staring , shallow breaths barely stirring the stray hairs he thought should tickle her nose , he wondered why she never mentioned Laurie . Angelina  --  odd old-fashioned name , he whispered it and the bedroom swallowed it , he winked at his shadow slatted onto her ribbed bedspread and fell asleep . " Lissen , Laurie 's away for the whole weekend , okay if I come down tonight ? " Watching her hesitate he reconsidered indirection , a principle he 'd abandoned , temporarily . " Excuse me for asking , I 'll go home and write you a letter . " She was still frowning as she rummaged through the packaged soups. 59 " They always have a shitload of onion and mushroom but never the ones I want . Who buys up all the spring vegetable and the garden vegetable ? It 's those fucking health freaks ! " And turning back to face him : " Sal 's not working tonight , he pulled day shift for himself the rest of this month . " And maybe because he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down anyway and have some coffee with us , maybe there 's a good movie on , you can hold Nikky 's hand on the couch . " Why did she enjoy needling him ? From the security of his own stoop , resting his groceries , he offered Carbone a cigarette and asked him point-blank . " Yeah , I seen him around . Some . Kinda guy you 'd always bump into , so I never paid no attention to him . His clothes always looked like he slept in them . " Watching Carbone 's lip curl , the kid decided his risk was small . " Did anybody ever get close with him  --  I mean , hang around with him , know him real well ? " Carbone scraped at a stain the kid could n't see , then traced the knife crease in his cord pants with his thumbnail and forefinger . " Who you working for ? " His grin , to deprecate , did n't reassure the kid . " She was on my caseload , the one he killed . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I skipped her , she did n't need checking up on . Though usually she was my first stop , she made good coffee . " Actually she always made instant coffee , very weak . " So I 've been thinking about writing something about it  --  about her  --  and about him . It 's the first public thing that ever happened I feel close to . " 6oLAURIE Sometimes I say : " Well , maybe he 'll make supervisor if he stays on another two years , or even another year now , the way they 're losing people . But he 's not the career type . " Sometimes I just shrug : " Well , I would n't say he likes it , but he 's learning a lot . But it 's wearing , it drains him , sometimes he comes home so beat he ca n't even talk about what he 's seen . " It depends on who 's asking . Why should I have to defend him , nobody expects anything from him any more ! Sometimes Iget exasperated and snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit dictionaries ? Go back to grad school ? Or teach ? More real problems cross his desk in a day than you see in a year ! And besides he does n't talk to me about what he 's really into , for all I know he 's writing the great American novel . " When they do n't laugh I realize they 're actually worried he might outflank them . Would he be flattered ? They saw none of his friends , who stopped being curious soon after he stopped phoning ; it takes barely six months to forget a phone number and he was never the kind you called up casually , to chat with . It 's a big city , he whistled , savoring the sense of his demise , sinking into the street world . But avoided the uptown cinemas and the few bars he guessed they still patronized . Laurie 's crowd did n't count , he sniffed at their expensive linen , leched after their women , luckily there 'd never been overlaps . Of course he would n't tell her , tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recopied his notes , added descriptions of all the children . And Thomas . Stole her folder , those originals he could risk keeping and Xeroxes of records he stamped CLOSED and shipped upstairs . He wanted photographs , not necessarily her wedding picture taped onto the oval mirror of her dresser , but at least one with some of the children , snap-6ishots . " Just some background stuff , " he mumbled to Laurie once , she 'd surprised him shuffling his index cards , the few clippings neatly pasted . Locked them into his desk drawer . LAURIE I always have this same dream about reading how my mother died in a plane crash , even after I wake up it never surprises me , I guess way inside I think that 's what newspapers are for . Three winters ago I saw this squib about a Cape patrolman drowned trying to rescue a capsized fisherman , stared at his name in the smudgy print till the letters blurred and I could n't focus . We rented the beach cottage beside his saltbox for five straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy nibbled my breasts under my wet suit when we sand  --  wrestled , he was too short for me but accidentally I 'd run my fingers over the smooth olive skin of his thighs . His father had blond tangled curls matting his chest ; bowlegged he 'd shout his kids in to dinner from his back steps like a tribal chief his little girl squalled when he tossed her . Naturally she played tomboy , pummeledhis broad back and practiced spitting through her front teeth at the rest of us . He gave me rides into town in his police car so I could parade the beach in my tight white jeans . " Now do n't you be causing no trouble with all them hot bloods ! " he 'd shout after me , and I 'd turn to wave goodbye , flushed but pleased , I knew what he was seeing . Or thought I did . And if he 'd moved , once , touched my hand before I could open my door or fingered my hair with his huge callused fingers ? I cried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I thought I 'd finished , and yet I never heard his name , only read it in the paper , we always called him Mister . Almost closing time , watching the old man wind up his awning , gnarled hands spinning his oiled crank in a hesitant circle , he sucked his finger , waiting . The old man hobbled62back into his store and arrested , one by one , the three **29;12304;TOOLONG the kid had spun into motion , then edged behind the counter to wipe the already clean marble top with a damp dishcloth . " Lissen I 'm gon na close up soon . " So the kid ordered another lemon ice , his third . " But everybody says you knew him better than anybody else . Certainly enough to talk to . " Resigned shrug but a hint of anger , tamping the ice with his scoop , honest value , hands no longer aware of their motions overfill the cup . Could just as well pass off a false bottom on me , he knows he does n't have to bother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . I 'd lay something on him if I knew the right way . " He 's always come in here . Sometimesa candy bar , sometimes a Coke , once in a while maybe a pack cigars . What 's he gon na say ? I say hello , he says hello . Maybe it 's a hot day I say it 's hot he says yeah , it 's hot . Same thing in winter . He 's not the kinda guy shoots his mouth off . Maybe once or twice he complains about his leg . Otherwise he keep his mouth shut , he do n't push himself on people . Besides which we were n't related . " So the kid avoids the hand extending his cup of lemon ice , but the old man sets the cup on the counter and turns away to replace the cover of the lemon ice carton , pounds its edges closed and lowers it into its freezer well . " Look I 'm sorry I got ta close up now . " His wife does n't trouble to dissemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " It 's already twenty past and we got ta eat quick , we got a meeting at the church to go to . " Apologetic mumble , actually it was Bingo and just last week he was three cards away from Giordano 's motherin-lawwho keeled over and passed away right there on the63floor , she needed only one more number to fill her bottom line . Drained but hospitable , twenty years behind his own counter , the secret of Manhattan 's finest Italian ice would die with him , lately his wife had begun to fear they 'd never see Florida although he 'd made all the deposits . The kid sucked noisily at his ice . " You were in the club when he finally got back from the war . De Marco told me you were the only one who remembered what his girl looked like . And you were there the day he fell off the ladder and ruined his knee . " Successive blinks seemed to tug his eyes back at the corners , chasing a shadow through torn pages , fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen cents , get the hell outa here now and let us close up . " Wife pushed an angry broom across worn floorboards , menacing the kid 's sandals with a thin wedge of dust ; suddenly he was ashamed of his filthy toenails . " You 're working for some crummy paper , you just want dirt . We told the police all anybody 's gon na know , and we do n't owe you nothing . And anyway you 're wasting your time . He was only a drunk that killed a nigger . " SAL One time I thought he was gon na call me by name . Two of the boys was taking him downtown for his arraignment , I let them into the cage . " Why they lock me up ? " " Lock you up ? " I thought maybe he meant in the van , the way they brought him in . " You go down in a regular police car , they wo n't lock you up . " Kept staring at me till I began to feel I 'd let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but I do n't know what you mean . " Jangled his cuffs at me , shook his clamped wrists . " These . " " Oh , that ! Does n't mean anything , Dutch . Just a formality . They64put the cuffs on everybody who goes downtown . " Which was n't strictly true , we put them on anybody we think needs them . Manslaughterand up we put them on without thinking , but it ai n't an ironclad requirement . I woulda skipped it with Dutch but they 'd already cuffed him , I did n't like contradicting the boys . " It do n't mean anything . " " Where they take me ? " " To court . For your arraignment . " Like telling him for his Bar Mitzvah . " A lawyer 'll be there standing up for you , the Counselor got you one . It 's just a formality  --  they 'll read the charges against you , and ask you how you plead . The lawyer 'll handle the whole thing . " Maybe Hanratty was wrong , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guys like him take a long time working something outa their system , and it ai n't that easy killing anybody , even a nigger . The boys could see he still had something to say so they did n't rush him , nobody pushed him around the whole time he was at the precinct . " In front of the Judge , I have to wear these ? " Farillo beat me to it . " We 'll make an exception , " he says , unlocks the cuffs and slips them off Dutch 's wrists . He nodded , closest I ever seen him get to saying thank you. 6S1:40-2:25 Aluminum of the examining table cold on his bare ass , Matto , april 7 , 1965 his soggy pants rolled over his swollen knee and then tugged off by a disdainful nurse , waits . Needle , when it finally plunged , seared him : " Ai ! Aii ! " His fists clamped the thin table edge so tightly his knuckles showed white , but still his right leg bucked as his knee locked , straining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and the needle slipped through the younger doctor 's tentative fingers , slid down the puffy mound of kneecap and dropped to the floor . Matto was relieved it had n't shattered . His blood followed it . " Nurse ! " Older doctor , harsh , impatient . Another needle quickly sterilized . " And the knee , please . " He did n't feel the blood ooze , matting his knee , staining ( he discovered that evening ) his socks after trickling through the thick hair of his lower leg , thin red paste clotted with eggwhitepulp . His knee was burning . " Ice , ice ! " he begged . Nurse 's cotton pads soaked as she sopped , soft pats , skin subsiding like dough under her practiced fingers only to puff and bulge again as she discarded her stained pads . Matto could n't see her wrinkle her nose . " Better try it again ! " from the older doctor . " I 've had the same trouble with those knees . Tricky business . Too deep and you 're through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue lodgment to withstand the drainage pressure . Maybe , " shuffle of footsteps across the shiny floor , " if you just try it on the slant , like that  --  there , that 's it ! Just at the base of that protrusion . There ! Good ! That looks like it . Just bunch that flesh a little  --  nurse ! Hold his leg steady ! Now jab ! " 67Matto 's teeth locked , clamping his lower lip , but he could n't choke off his whimpers . " Quiet ! " " I  --  I think it 's lodged now , " the younger doctor whispered . " Can we get the clamp on ? Ah  --  good . Good work . Thank you , nurse . Now if you could just keep an eye on the drainage ? " First trickles of pus oozed into the pan , but Matto could n't open his eyes to see both doctors straighten , square their shoulders as the yellowish-white fluid , intestine color , flowed through colorless tubing to spill into the nurse 's enameled tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip out the bad pieces and sew me a new knee , pins and wire , like Dominic 's jaw . Sew it up , patch a new net with fisherman 's cord , throw any crab overboard smaller than five fingers , even when they crack their claws on your pole . " Bend it . " A pause . " Bend that knee ! " Matto 's eyelids waver , he fights for focus , wheels dizzily back from the Jersey beach where he and Joey and Mike raced three girls in one-piece bathing suits across wet sand to the water 's edge , green and orange beach ball contriving to elude them , out into deeper water , over his head , fear cramping his stomach as he dog-paddled toward the ball . Bottom of the boat they rented crawling with crabs , stalks and claws pawing their legs as the crabs slid , clinking , as waves rocked them , bushel barrels overflowing with blue-black shells and gesticulating feelers till they felt trapped in an ark of crabs and still kept pulling up more . Two baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their extra bait , they balanced on the crossboards to preserve their legs from nips and bites already beginning to swell . Finally they jumped into the choppy sea and swam to shore , abandoning the boat , derelict graveyard for hundreds of crabs unable to crawl up its wet sloping sides to flop back into the sea " Bend that knee . Bend it ! Wake up , you ! " His cheekbone swollen , distorting the right side of his face and twisting his gray scrubby mustache , the older doctor glares at Matto . " Bend it , dammit , ca n't you hear ? " Flush mottling his forehead , splotched skin . Patchy . " Nurse , bend that knee . Either he ca n't understand English or he 's an idiot . " " Fuck you , " Matto grunts . " Goddam butcher . " Sharp sucking intake of breath and diffident , crisp footsteps as the nurse edges between Matto and the stooping younger doctor . A gentle pressure down and reluctantly , the knee flexes , Matto whimpers as the needle rips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward as his muscles strain to articulate the cap , sag and then expand . " Again ! " And again Matto whimpers , stares at the vibrating plunger , wills to eject it , force its point up through the layers of tissue to clatter into the tray already stained with his blood and pus . " Again , nurse . Articulate it . " Bent so her reddish curls under her starched cap are level with Matto 's crotch , the nurse works his leg like a pump handle , forcing out the thick fluid . Matto 's mumble a counterpoint . " Fucking butcher . Butcher . Butcher . " " Ignore it . Just ignore it . " Perhaps because the younger doctor glanced up , licked his lips , considered a tentative69protest ? Or disclaimer ? Stiff , shoulders forced back , the older doctor continued his inspection of the trickle of yellow fluid . The younger doctor wriggles his foot and then taps his toe repeatedly against the cross-brace of the examining table . " It looks as if it 's  --  is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First real flow of blood will clear it . That 's fine , nurse . That 's very good . Just a little more now . " " Aah . " Shivers . His leg dangles , no longer flexed . " Whew ! That 's better . Angry-looking knee . " Younger doctor wiped his brow and then his lower lip , ran his fingers over his stubbled chin , remembering he 'd forgotten to shave and wondered whether the older man had noticed . And minded . " Caught it earlier , might 've brought it down with Cortisone , I guess . Certainly a good chance . But now that tissue 's so inflamed  --  " " Neglected it . Ignored it till he could n't move , hoping if he let it alone it might get better . Either they come running in here every time they get a twinge or they do n't come in till it 's too late . When did you first hurt that knee ? " " It 's all right now , " the nurse was whispering , light fingertaps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all over , all I have to do is bandage it up and that wo n't hurt , you can open your eyes now . " Matto opened his eyes . The older doctor , leaning against the file cabinet . " How long ago did you first hurt that knee ? " 70 " First ? " Matto stared at the floor and then his toes . " Long time ago . " Plank borrowed from Nick 's brother-in-law stretched between two ladders , Maria 's rickety old wooden stepladder and the new metal one Herman contributed to the club . Matto pushing dust off the ceiling with rollers , splotting and covering the dust he ca n't dislodge with a thick coating of white paint which clotted his hair , speckled his forehead , even his eyelids were coated . " Why do n't you wear a cap , you donkey ? I 'll need a whole bottle of turpentine just for your hair , I 'll get sick from the smell of it . " Turning to smile at Maria he heard fibers snap , lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a white spiral which coated counter and window , his right arm grabbed for the can 's sturdy handle , dubious anchor , as he fell . " His chart shows treatment going back to 1957 . For that knee . " The nurse , hesitantly , crouching to ease a gauze pad onto the knee and then wind a bandage round . " Mostly for the cartilage . " " Yes . Well , we 'll have to X-ray that , I 'm afraid . " Younger doctor blinking at Matto as the nurse secured the gauze wrapping , criss-crossing the tape which would anchor the bandage and steady the knee . " When the inflammation 's down a bit more . Might be some of the cap damaged , as well as all that tissue bruised . And the cartilage is probably torn . Ca n't tell without an X-ray . You 'll have to make another appointment . " Over her shoulder , quick glance at the older doctor who sniffed , contemptuous . " We do n't work on appointments here , " the nurse mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Out-Patients , they 'll send him for his X-ray . As long as it 's marked on his chart . " Resting his palms against the damp table , back crooked forward , Matto scraped the tip of his tongue across the back of his teeth as his knee began to throb again . " Oh , I  --  I was n't told that , " the younger doctor muttered . " Well , in that case , we 'll need to see you in  --  I guess , about a week , a week should do it . A week seem about right to you , for that inflammation to go down ? " Evasive glance at the older doctor , pretending absorption in Matto 's chart . " And you 'd better stay off that  --  keep off your fret as much as possible . In bed most of the day , do n't walk until there 's no pain left . Are you off work ? Or can you take sick leave ? " " No . " " You ca n't take sick leave ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Well at least stay off your feet . Rest that leg as much as you can . It 'll be dangerous to put any strain on that knee . What kind of work do you do ? " " Load trucks . " " Oh . I see . " Again the younger doctor peeked over his shoulder . " Well , ah , I guess in that line of work you  --  could n't you collect unemployment ? Just for a couple of weeks ? Or call in sick , tell them what happened to you ? We can give you a certificate if you want one . " " No unemployment . No disability . No sick leave . Dollar an hour , no insurance . " Matto lifted his head , his knee throbbed. 72 " Day labor . Donkey work . Get to agency eight thirty every morning , stand in line for work . Ten per cent commission . Once in a while free coffee . I stay home , nobody cares . Hospital pay me to stay home ? " The nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over his knee , swathed now in a massive white guard , measured the older doctor 's snort and waited through the pause which meant he was forming , word by word , a devastatingretort as he tapped Matto 's chart . Renowned throughout Orthopedics for his wit , he was reputed to have driven at least two clumsy nurses to tears . The younger doctor fumbled his jacket buttons and then stared down at his fingers as if he 'd expected a more elegant interlacing . But the older doctor found , after consideration , nothing satisfying to say , set Matto 's folder on the nurse 's table and turned to the door . " Well , if you really have to work , you 'll need some support for that knee . It 's still risky to use it at all , but at least you should have a pair of crutches . You might even be able to prop yourself up , once in a while , as you 're working . Nurse , how do we get him a pair of crutches ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the door , before the nurse could begin to explain requisition procedure . " But  --  I mean  --  with that degree of inflammation , especially if he ca n't afford to take off work , I 'd have thought that at least  --  " The older doctor never bothered to glance at Matto . " He 's had two pairs of crutches and three canes allocated since 1957 . Check his records . Nurse , requisition him a cane to borrow , so he can get home . Make sure it 's marked on loan . Explain to him that if he does n't return it when he comes back73next week , he wo n't get his knee X-rayed . That Irish woman with the bursitis in her shoulder 's already been sent in ? " He pushed through the cubicle 's swinging door . Younger doctor , still wagging his head , turned to Matto . " Well , make sure and take care of that leg . Do n't work any harder than you have to . And I 'll see you next week . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger doctor pushed through the door , hurrying after the taller figure disappearing into another cubicle . " You can get into these yourself , ca n't you ? " Nurse handed Matto his damp bunched trousers , retreated to her charts to write and tear off a requisition slip . " You do n't have those canes any more , do you ? " As Matto shook his head , trying to grope his left foot into its trouser leg , crouching to dangle the trousers to save bending his knee , she decided she could n't risk ordering crutches , no way to alter what Supply would stamp in his records , she could brazen it past the younger one but if the other one ever checked out her records there 'd be hell to pay . And he just might , she thought , he 's the type who remembers . " You just take this downstairs , third window on the left of the elevators , it says Supplies over the window . You hand it to the girl there , she 'll give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to bring it back . And do n't mind what that doctor says , " she whispered . " He 's a sour man , he takes it out on everybody , nobody likes him . He 's leaving soon . " She smiled as she handed the slip over , but both Matto 's hands were suspending his trousers , so she set the slip beside him , thinking that canes cost maybe forty-five cents apiece the way the hospital bought them , thousands at a time . In the cubicle across the hall , empty because a student nurse had misdirected the Irish woman with74bursitis in her shoulder , the older doctor yawned , elaborately . " They sell everything they can get their hands on . You 'd have been requisitioning those crutches straight to a pawnshop . " Later that night , after discussing the incident in bed with his wife , the younger doctor decided what he should have said. 75april 9 , 1965 Carson left the clipping on my desk , outlined in red . How the hell does she remember all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my desk . Two cops on duty , stopping everybody going into the building , one of them told me the kids had disappeared . When I finally got back to the office I called the precinct . " Missing without a trace . " I scrawled it across the kids ' pages , wrote CASE CLOSED on the lip of her folder . My first entry was late October 1963 , I 'd seen her five times. 10/22/63Mrs . Eliza Wilson called , ADC1471-837 . OAA refuses to answer queries about her mother 's whereabouts , last records at nursing home two years old . Carson tossed the note on my desk . " Tell her we 're not running a Missing Persons bureau . " Curious , I climbed her stairs , only a month short of my required statutory visit , my grandfather died in a nursing home where embittered men locked themselves in the toilets on visiting days . " Come on in , " she shouted from the kitchen , sorting Corinna 's baby clothes still stiff from the clothesline , " door 's open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . " I could smell the bleach on her hands . " I used to visit her every Sunday , right after church I 'd take the bus , but then I got sick and after that Thomas started coming by , and with one thing after another , time went by . Now when I call they tell me they got no records on her . And here I visited her in the same place every Sunday for three years and they got no records ? But I ca n't get nothing outa them , every time they told me they couldn't77help I 'd ask them , well what should I do ? They 'd wait for a long time and then they hang up . " When I promised her I 'd find out , she nodded . " You probably will . I guess I 'm lucky I 'm on the State , otherwise I would n't have nobody white to turn to . " Only apartment on my whole caseload I could relax in . " How many investigators you had ? " I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted . First one was one too many . Couple were real bastards , hated my guts and said so . And a couple more never showed up , never could find them when you needed something . So you ai n't bad . You do n't know much , and it seems like you learn slow , but you do n't mind talking , and you ai n't asked for more than coffee . Yet . " Not that I had principled objections . Just felt inept , too much to handle . Her slow body heaving up off her chair to scoop Claudie into the bathroom . Stared at her mountainous breasts , placid beneath her housecoat while I sipped her coffee , thinking I 'd probably smother . So I guess Thomas bothered me . He was just there too often . One morning I wanted a cup of her coffee and some easy chatter to put the best possible face on the rest of my day . Thomas was in his shorts , I snapped before I thought . " What the hell are you doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped his bare feet on her rickety table . " Now why the hell should I care whether you get fired or not ? " He was right , in retrospect I decided , but then I wanted to kick his chair out from under him . " Look , if I get fired on account of you , you might not wind up in jail but she 'd damn sure lose her grant . I 've seen you here three times now and covered for you each time , there 's a state law not only makes you liable for the kids but says you can be78arrested just for sitting here . You probably did n't even watch out for yourself when you came in , the whole building might know you 're here . " " You just worry ' bout what you write in that little black book , I 'll worry about the neighbors . She ever gets cut off I 'll know how to say thanks . " " Thomas , hush up . Just you hush up . " And turned to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to do a little checking up on your own ? " I shook my head . " No , I was n't trying to check up . Today 's my day in the field . I decided to start here . " " Your day in the what ? " she said . Thomas just snorted . Memo to DW : In response to your form 82Y of 10/22 . Mrs. A. Saunders deceased 8/15/62 , Mendelsohn Branch , NY State OA Shelter . Interred in state grounds , LI Cemetery by State Order #44H-517 . No marker . I kept it for eight days , debated mailing it to her . Guilt finally forced me up her stairs . I set it on her table and just shook my head when she asked me , she set her iron to rest on her radiator and walked over to read it . " I 'm sorry . " She tapped the memo with a discolored nail . " Momma was a proud woman , and yet she always said they 'd bury her in the Potter 's Field . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bought because Jews always get their money's79worth , wiped them slowly on a faded dishtowel , smoothed out the letter 's creases and folded it into Linda 's Bible . Then she eased herself into her kitchen chair and rocked on its hind legs , nodding . I coughed and cleared my throat , wanting to go . " After my daddy went up North he sent back money every month so my momma could board us while she cooked for my aunt in her restaurant . When she had enough money saved up she carted us all North , only to find my daddy shacked up with another woman . And moved right in . After a month the other woman left and after six months my daddy left . You can get out now , " she said . " You did what you said . I 'm ' bout to cry , there ai n't nothing you can do about it , and no need to be watching . " After I cleared up her records and buried her file I roamed her streets . Stray details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must 've used for her heavy loads . Attendant shook his head , ancient machines grinding . " Nobody leaves their name here , just their wash . " The guy in the pocket bodega winked at me . " Big woman with good boobs , no ? Very touchy ! She stopped her kids coming in here because she thought I padded the tab . Maybe once or twice , but when I realized she was particular I treated her right . She just never realized how much candy those kids could eat . " I walked past the beauty parlor but did n't have the guts , and the other stores she might 've used seemed too peripheral . The kids were gone , one of a hundred possible relatives had spirited them uptown or across the river , over to Jersey , down to Philadelphia or Baltimore , west as far as Chicago . " Look , wait a second , I was Mrs. Wilson 's investigator , the man from the Welfare , from the State , " I shouted . She did n't want8oto stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me but wanted to forget me now , pressing against her stomach something tightly wrapped in thick brown paper and heavy gray twine . " All I 'm trying to do is find out what happened to the kids  --  they still got money due to them from the State . " Reluctantly she set her parcel on a garbage-can lid . " Everybodywants to know . What makes them kids so damn important all of a sudden ? Police wants to know , Child Care wants to know , now you want to know . I 'll tell you what I told them , sister-in-law took those kids up to the Bronx . If I knew her name I would n't tell you . " That left Thomas . This morning I told Carson : " You 'd only laugh at me . " " Probably , " Carson nodded , " but if you 're already prepared , it wo n't hurt so bad . Sit down and tell me about it . " " I need a couple of days . Two at the most . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's case . Nothing specific . And on my own time . If you cover for me for two days , I 'll do my reports at home . " " Forget it . Just catch up by the end of the week . If you 're headed uptown , stay away from the Center , they 'll think you 're part of some special investigative unit . See you . " Prophetic as usual . I hated uptown . I had one address for Thomas , phone number really , bar and pool hall he gave me " in case something happens to the kids . " Claudie and Corinne were his . I hated uptown . Nobody I know even goes to the8iApollo any more . Naturally the bar was a mile from the subway , I 'd taken the wrong line . Zigzagged through tenement blocks , my eyes fixed on the next few squares of sidewalk , side-stepping the hordes of kids scampering through the streets but prickling under the stares their elders gave me as they sat fanning themselves on wooden folding chairs on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill its congregation into the street so I circled it , then past another storefront stained like a frosted Victorian bathroom window , I did n't stop to read which brotherhood sang . Finally I reached the Avenue . I knew if I started to hesitate I 'd never go on , so I shoved the door open but it banged too loudly behind me , everybody looked up . Or seemed to . " What you want ? " I heard , but could n't locate the speaker , besides I had no answer . He sat in the back , at a table by himself in the shadows without a drink , watching a bald man with massively hunched shoulders circle his table with a short but fluid stroke . " Thomas , " I said . He nodded , motioned me to the seat beside him . I sat down and then pushed my chair back , banging my shin on the table 's crosspiece . " I 'll buy you a drink . " Two bourbons , a good strong Kentucky . I knew what he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought him a cigar just to be allowed to sit but he might 've asked what I thought I was celebrating . He sipped at the thick rim . So I sipped at mine . " I was gon na call you for money for the undertaker . But her brother kept claiming he 'd cover it all . He 's high-handed , ca n't stomach me , thinks I 'm trash , thinks I held Liza down . We 've tangled before . That 's why I never showed up at the funeral . " 82We sat . I toyed with my drink , sipping as slowly as I could , but I was still finished long before he took his second sip . I wondered if he 'd ever known her age . " I checked back in her records  --  she was only thirty-seven . I never realized she was that young . " Some moments later he shifted his weight and his chair creaked . " I started remembering how long we 'd been seeing each other . I actually ran into her in the old emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one of her kids wrapped up in a blanket , some damn fool had just split the side of my head open with a chair . One of them doctors tried to give her a hard time and she just lit out after him , followed him right through the doors into his ward , yelling she 'd take the place apart until they tended to her daughter . They did . Some kind of fever . I made my mind up right then I wanted to see that woman , got one of the brothers on the ward to find out her address for me . That was four , maybe even five years ago . " " She told me the story once . It was Melinda and she was coming down with some kind of septic fever , she thought Melinda was dying . And then the doctor tried to tell her it was n't really an emergency and she should come back in the morning or go to a private doctor , at two o'clock after she 'd already woken Mrs. Turner to watch the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck down to the Slip . " " You got a good memory , " Thomas said , " and I 'm grateful for the bourbon , but why do n't you get the hell outa here ? There 's all kinda ways of doing the man 's work " ' 83Saturday evening Angie had Lawrence Welk on when he knocked , he could hearjuly 10 , 1965 the wheezy accordian spilling polka music through her hollow door . She slid the safety latch back , why bother to double-lock your door with a cop in your kitchen ? " You 're just in time , " she grinned up at him , housecoat open on a pale blue slip , " we 're still working on our second cup of coffee . " Nikky was jabbing a pair of Angie 's old shoes with a broken scissors and the screen was bellying Welk 's grin at the bulge of the tube and then tumbling it in a slow floating motion , just as the top of Welk 's head disappeared his torso would drift into view . " Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hot . " A nod toward Sal , and an answering glower . I would n't be gracious either , in your shoes , the kid thought . " You back on day shift again ? " Only a grunt for response . " Sit down , " Angie said . " We were just talking about Markowitz , the stingy bastard , trying to figure out how we could maneuver him into air-conditioning the whole building . " " Momma , I wan na change it , can I change it ? " Nikky hollered . Eased into his seat , vinyl chair covering already sticky against his jeans . " I walked down by the river today , see if I could get away from the heat a little . Your people really cruise those piers . Seemed like every time I stopped near a row of trailer trucks there was a squad car slowing down to watch me . Those trucks get boosted a lot ? " Another shrug . And reluctantly : " I du n no . It ai n't my division . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security squad , it mighta been their cars . And most of the shipping companies pay for their own private patrols , they got radio hook-ups from inside . " 85 " Nope . These were straight squad cars . Fourth Precinct , not Safety Division . " A decent response , given Sal 's standards , why push it ? " Couple of them who stopped to watch me looked just about ready to call me over . Guess if I 'd been black they would n't have hesitated . " " They 're just doing their job . " Sal set his cup down and tipped his stool back . " Besides if you was colored you probably would n't be down there in the first place , you might have something better to do . It 's small pickings down there unless you 're organized . Happens at night , whole trailers through the tunnel to Jersey where they get unloaded , the stuff they 're carrying gets split up . They mighta thought you were a spotter , trying to figure out what 's inside each trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use people spottingthe loads , figuring out which trailers are heavy and what they 're carrying . " " I thought it was n't your division . " " Now look , do n't start that shit again . The two of you do n't spend five minutes together without looking for a fight , you 're worse than a coupla women ! We were spending a quiet Saturdaynight before you came in ; if you ca n't sit and talk decent , go in and watch TV with Nikky . " Noticing she did n't suggest getting out , the kid was reassured . " You 're right . I always come in with a chip on my shoulder , whenever Sal 's around . But it 's not my imagination that I see more cops every day . Makes me jumpy . " " Momma I wan na change it , I do n't like that silly man and the picture wo n't hold still ! " 86 " Well , " Sal said reluctantly , stretching to scratch the back of his neck , " you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jumpy . After last summer you ca n't tell what 's gon na happen , the least little spark and we got people in the streets which is what we got the strictest orders to prevent . By any means necessary . The boys at City Hall have been very clear , we get through this summer without any incidents uptownor across the river and we just might have pretty smooth sailing , come bargaining time in October . But anything breaks out and the shit hits the fan for us . " " This city 'll never survive a policemen 's strike , " Angie said . " You ca n't stop a riot with heavier surveillance , " the kid said . " You 're just helping to heat things up . " I do n't give a fuck if a goddam riot breaks out in five or six spots all over the city , all they 'll do is burn down some buildingshoulda been torn down years ago , wipe out some crummy Jew stores been stealing nickels and dimes outa their crummy neighborhoods . Who gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give them half the city and never send a cruiser in . They could hustle all the dope they wanted and bump each other off in broad daylight . " " I wan na change it , I wan na change it ! " Nikky screamed . " Momma , momma , I wan na change it , I wan na change it now ! " Angie scraped the kid 's fly with her hand and then her thigh as she edged around the kitchen table only because the kitchen was so cramped since she 'd moved the refrigerator . Nikky87would begin to pound the floor with her fists and then her feet and finally with the already scarred ridge of her forehead , the last bout with Angie cost three stitches and an injection before she stopped screaming . " It 'll come to that , " the kid said withoutconviction from somewhere behind her housecoat as she squirmed past him ; he debated snaking a careful hand under her slip . " One of these days you 'll find yourself behind a barricadewith your pistol cocked , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And when that fine day comes , " Sal said , " I 'll take my chances with the rest of the boys on the force . But just where will you be ? " ANGIE I walked out on them , switched the goddam set to another channel and stroked Nikky 's head and played with her curls and the tickly spots behind her ears till I had her giggling . Sometimes I just wanted Sal to smash the kid 's head through the kitchen cabinet . But it was me after all invited him down , and if I was n't going to kick him out I could n't just sit there and let them argue , neither one was having much fun . So I shoved myself up off my ass and marched back in . " Lissen , " I said to the kid . " Sal says you been scouting the neighborhood trying to pick up more tidbits on Matto . How come you never asked me ? I went with Al the grocery manager during the whole winter Matto was working nights at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she could n't remember what she 'd never been told . Al was one of the few who never talked , even afterwards . The rest of the crew swore they kept their mouths shut but actually boasted all over the neighborhood , flashed their money and spread it around , the only time they were careful was when they broke in somebody new . They88worked Matto 's ass off for months , barely talking to him , isolating him in the coffee breaks but checking his order sheets and prices like they had shares in the company . Matto tried to please but could n't crack their reserve ; bewildered , he fumbled out a plea for explanation . " We 're watching you , that 's all you need to know . This here 's an elite crew , nobody in the city works as tight as we do . " When one of their regulars got transferred uptown they had to decideovernight whether to take him in or cut their take . They took him in , congratulated him on having survived his probation , pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painless transition . But they watched every flicker of his eyelids as Al explained how their system worked . The take was worth $200 a night per person easy , if Matto had pleaded cold feet they 'd have considered getting rid of him . But Matto never even measured the risk , whatever they did was fine with him , and if he came home every Friday with triple his paycheck in his pocket ? Aunt Carrie could always use a little extra . They had it easy . Night shift started at ten p.m. ; by one , after the cigarette breaks , several cups of coffee , and finally a huge meal  --  frozen steaks from the griddle , fried onions , melted cheese , torpedo rolls , gallons of Coke  --  they had already finished most of their eighthourquota . After another round of coffee with maybe a beer or a nip from a flask somebody remembered to bring in , they settled down for a nap ; nobody else would sleep in the produce warehouse but Matto was used to dampness , shipboard molded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato sacks into a dusty quilting and squirmed into a lumpy sleep . Between two thirty and three o'clock Voto 's unmarked pick-up pulled up to the loading platform and beeped , softly , before parking next to one of the loaded trailers , Al stayed awake to guide him in . Nobody bothered to tell Matto how89much of his night 's work went into the Teamster treasury , not that he would 've begrudged it . But Al must 've known their time was limited , yearly inventory would show so big a gap between total intakeand volume , ten trailer trucks would n't restore the balance , what was he figuring on ? Every night after three trips in Voto 's pick-up had unloaded a couple thousand dollars worth of name-brand canned goods at Voto 's warehouse , they divided up the same way , one share for everybody . Voto paid al/at 40 per cent off current store prices , and Al stood with the regulation warehouse list , checking off each carton , he even gave Voto reductions on damaged cartons and dented cans , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money at stake . Voto added another 40 per cent for himself when he sold off the cartons to dozens of neighborhood merchants who charged their customers a penny or two more per can than the supermarket price and pocketed a handsome 20 per cent instead of their usual 4 per cent , which barely covered overhead . Top speed two or three nights a week , they put maybe $350 to $500 extra in their pockets , tax-free . During those six months of night work Matto banked over $5,000 . Until the Polack squealed . Next to Al , he 'd worked the warehouse the longest , but he never complained , often volunteered to cook the steaks and always remembered that Matto liked his medium , with the fat burned . His cans always displayed the store 's neatest prices , stamped square into the center and never smudged ; cashiers always knew the aisles he 'd worked the night before . Al guessed it was some whim of his wife 's he 'd forgotten about till punch-out time . Maybe she was pregnant , maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring home and then forgot and this time he decidedhe would n't come home empty-handed . How much difference could three little cans of mushrooms shoved into his coat sleeves make , 90after hundreds of thousands of dollars already untrucked and sold oft ? A small fortune , as it turned out , shot , for the whole crew . Matto was fumbling with the oversize top button of his new mackinaw as the Polack ambled out of the aisles and headed for the door and the parkinglot . " Hold it a minute , buddy . " Store detective , shorter than Matto . " New policy , we 're checking all the staff this week . Mind if I pat you down ? It 's only routine . " Al figured afterwards the detective probably spotted the Polack , nobodyknew he was in the store so the Polack would n't have bothered to be careful . " Okay , buddy , " the store detective said , he 'd reached up into the Polack 's armpits to extract the three tiny cans of mushrooms . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us should 've stopped him , Al said afterwards , but I never imagined he 'd panic . The worst he 'd have gotten was a week in the manager 's doghouse and we 'd still be working . The night crew gradually drifted together to stare through the frosted glass at the indistinct blur of the manager 's face as he listened to the Polack . Al said he wanted to run but the cruiser from the precinct had already showed up to wait for the bank to deliver the sacks of coins and bills for the cashiers ' tills . The manager kept clearinghis throat . " Publicity 's what we do n't want , otherwise you boys would already be down at the precinct . But this kind of thing always pushes sales down , once it gets out ; somehow people decide there 's something fishy going on and feel more comfortable shopping elsewhere . So I think we 'll probably decide to keep this one quiet , at least until I check with the head office . But do n't think you 're getting a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . And I would n't try working for anybody 's grocery department or warehouseagain . I 'll make sure the word gets around . " It did . After Al 's convertible was impounded , and Matto 's and Jeffs bank accounts frozen and seized , and the lump payment received from Voto after9 1his lawyers read the night crew 's signed statements which the managerand the police had demanded , the manager recouped enough of his loss to bring his yearly gross figures under the 5 per cent margin allowed him on the books for losses through theft and accidental destruction . SAL I knew the kid was bad news first morning I met him , sipping Angie 's coffee . Nobody had to draw me a map . Angie grinned and pointed a finger at his mop of hair , it was so matted he could n't stand to put a comb through it until after his coffee . Sensitive kid . After he went downstairs once he was sure his wife was gone , Angie tried to explain but I cut her off We were n't kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what trouble looks like when it 's sitting in your kitchen . When I got back to the precinct I looked him up , but we did n't have anything on him except one complaint from his downstairs neighbors about a noisy party . At least he kept his nose clean . He got on my ass . Any kid with a college degree could walk into Welfare and knock down an investigator 's job at a hundred a week , Department was dying for staff , but he hadda pretend he was on a mission ! He started lecturing me one morning and I got pissed off , I been in and out of tenements for forty-five years . " Lissen , how you gon na change anything when it 's twenty-five to ten and you 're still sitting on your ass in your underwear ? Welfare opens at nine sharp , same as every other city department . " Every investigator cuts corners , if they covered their caseload official , followed the department 's book , they 'd work an eighty-hour week and wind up in Bellevue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but instead of admitting he was just lazy , he winks at me like we was playing the same game . " Today 's my morning in the field . " " Yeah , " I says , " plowing. " 92Which brought Angie 's eyebrows up and got me more disgusted , he was such a snot nose ! Angie wanted something young she coulda picked a kid from the neighborhood who knew how to keep his mouth shut . I went into the bedroom to catch some sleep , when Angie came in for his clothes she bent down to kiss me but I shoved her off After he finally got dressed and dragged himself off to work she came back to bed . " Maybe you 're right , " she says , " I know how you feel but there 's something about him that gets to me . He keeps noticing all kinds of things , last night he hadda get up and tiptoe into Nikky 's room to see if she sucks her thumb when she 's asleep . And he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's weird in a way , but it 's different . " I did n't feel like saying anything , I rolled over onto my stomach . " I think he 's a fake , " I mumbled , " I think he 's a fake and the kind of guy never knows what he wants , I think you 're asking for trouble . " She poked me in the ribs with her forefinger , she was n't being playful . " I 'm old enough , " she said . " I can handle whatever kinda trouble he makes . " 932:45-2:50 Quickly turning to rain. april 7 , 1965 So what if he ripped up their requisition slip , he would'vegot just as wet with a cane . Or crutches . He limped faster than some people his age walked , could have shielded his scalpfrom the water which soaked his hair and edged down his neck to dampen his already soggy collar . But he was too stubborn to wear a hat . And he got splattered because he was trying to count forward from 1914 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hooves . He never even heard those horses . Sixteen , prancing in formation , matched pairs , only a fraction have thoroughbred blood but they look good , they 're supposed to , Department always hires top trainers to do their purchasing . NEIGHBORHOOD Some Russian count trains them . Used to command the Cossacks LEGEND who guarded the Czar . Hope he 's learned something since then . Urban cavalry for the uptown show routes . Mostly ceremonial , occasionally dragooned into pesky bureaucratic duties , it demeans a slick-brushed , shiny-maned horse to carry a thigh-booted cop writing a parking ticket . Save them for the ticker-tape parades , the big politicians ' escorts , they 're too high-spirited to squander on administration . Let the computers handle the traffic , half those tickets never get paid anyway . Lissen , the stable boys wink at each other , if thesehorses could talk they 'd run the Department . Gelded stallions , sorrel , chestnut , and bay , stable-freeafter a damp morning , snorting curls of white vapor which95slowly condense in crisp air . Toss mane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firmly held reins before polished leather boots dig stirrups into their flanks . Three quick whistles and a casually up-raised arm move the column off to reassure rather than conquer , a reminder , for uptown matrons , of commitments to stability their grandmothers took for granted . Neat manure pads on watered uptown streets whet the lunch-leaning appetites of impatient businessmen , while delicate little girls in white leotards and ballet slippers tiptoe across a polished studio floor to sway at French windows , noting the troop 's graceless carriage . Grandchildren of flat-milers , steeplechase , call-to-hounds , point-to-point , great-grandchildren of the desperate Crimean cavalry chargers and the spirited mounts of the Honor Guard of the Hohenzollerns , what egalitarian perversions conspired to force these ovcrbred relics to prance past idling autos , snorting in nervous disgust at exhaust fumes , doomed to bear until pastured the trained but pedestrian bulks of sons of the old sod whose fathers traditionally doffed their caps to everyone mounted ? And downtown ? Downtown-east , where he got splashed ? No percentage in patrolling those streets . Kids roll marbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harass nervous horseflesh . Patrol heading back to the stables , cops slumped , rolling , in their saddles , none of them yelled at him to step back . Matto stared , as they pounded past , at the mud splotching his already filthy pants and jacket . I lost my best black shooter in the mud . On tiptoe , trying tobalance , we threw penknives and carved the mud into pie slices . Hide96and seek in the long summer evenings , they said Cora would hide in the alley with anybody but she never hid with me . Onlyonce . She went first , she thought I was Vince . Soft whisper as I tiptoed through puddles : " Vince , Vince , hurry , they 'll find us . " She only let me feel her breasts under her sailor blouse ; her nipples were damp , her upper lip was sweaty when I tried to kiss her . " You do n't even know how to kiss , you ninny ! " Vince had a long thin one , afterwards he swore to her he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape when she snuck him into her room , but she never talked to him again . At first she only let him feel her up and finger her through her panties , but then Benny said she was getting hot , she squirmed on her bed till her boobs were hanging over the edge and when he finally took it out she grabbed for it and got it into her mouth . I knocked over the lamp because Benny shoved me trying to lean farther out the window , but nobody heard Benny 's father till he pushed the door open . When the fire escape stuck I was afraid to jump but Benny 's father was after us , only two landings away . I let go . The others knew how to land , but my knee went out as soon as I hit the sidewalk . The hospital gave me a brace and said it would heal without an operation . Afterward when we yelled at her in the street she just stuck her nose in the air . Once we made her cry , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell am I supposed to do , Sarge , ask him whatapril 7 , 1965 he did with the camera ? " Cinelli waved Matto to his customary seat and swore into the mouthpiece , so Matto eased into the spindly ladder-backed chair Cinelli set out for the boys and stared at the grillwork patterning Cinelli 's face . " Now look , Sarge , you got no right saying that about me , not after all the times I stuck my neck out for you . I 'm the one who 's taking the risk ! What happens if one of them figures it 's me who 's putting the finger on them ? I would n't stand a chance ! Yeah , I can really rely on the kinda protection you guys would give me , I seen what happened to Calio 's old man . So lay off me , Sarge , I told you I did n't see no camera . Sarge , you 're holding me up ! Sarge , Essen , we wo n't argue , for old times ' sake I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push me , Sarge , I 'm a poor man . That camera ai n't worth fifty bucks to its mother ! I do n't get no guaranteed pension outa this place , Sarge , and I do n't get no paid holidays , either . Thirty bucks , Sarge , that 's as high as I go , I got ta clear fifty on the camera just to break even , who 's gon na give me eighty bucks for it ? Thirty bucks , and you can check the sales slip . Okay ? Awright . Yeah , I got his address , but you got ta do me a favor . He 's gon na use that money to score , he 'll be there when you want him . So wait a day , two days , it do n't hurt you none . Otherwise I ca n't stay in business , it 's too risky , you show up on his doorstep twenty minutes after he walks outa here and if he do n't figure it out , the next guy will . And then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . That 's not a threat , Sarge , it 's a prediction . Yeah , awright , I 'll wait for you . With the address . And your thirty bucks , if somebody 's stupid enough to give me eighty for the camera . Do n't break your neck . " Cinelli slams the phone down and shakes his head99at Matto , dozing in his tilted chair . " Sometimes it 's hard to figure out who squeezes worse . " Some nerve threshold below the surface of Matto 's doze warned him he was being addressed . He slid up to waking , nodded agreement into the tail of Cinelli 's sentence . Cinelli sniffed at the accumulation of a day 's Out-Patient odors on Matto , his jacket honeycombed with patches and moth holes , trap for bad air . His knee , moreover , still leaked pus ; when he shifted , his bandage reminded him , constriction like a damp sponge . The camphor smell Matto catches in his nostrils is actually menthol , constituent of the thick cream Cinelli massages into his scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaky patches of dead skin drift down to coat his merchandise . " I think I 'm gon na close up and go home , Dutch . It 's shitty outside and nobody 's gon na miss me . Let that fat cop sweat a little when he sees my grating locked . " Matto nods , swallows , rubs at an itch in his shoulder and pushes himself up before he remembers to prop . His knee locks , a tumbling half-pivot and hopping , he reaches Cinelli 's window ledge to brace , panting at the pain . " Goddam knee , " he mumbles at Cinelli . " Hospital fixed me . Needle . Bastards . " Cinelli considered getting him to a doctor , that knee did n't look too good . But another half-hour would bring him dangerously close to rush-hour traffic . He watched Matto catch his breath , clamping his lower lip in a stubborn grimace against the pain , but Matto 's bandage was hidden by the bulges of his baggy trousers . Cinelli could n't guess how ugly the knee would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alwaysToolimp ? You feel all your scars in the rain . And it was n't pity . Who 'll miss one cane ? I 'll never get rid of all this junk . Cinelli 's sour hatred for the accumulation which kept him in bondage never interfered with his meticulous storage . He chose one of twenty similar curved yellow woods , rubber-tipped , and carried it out to Matto . " Here . It 's slippery out there . You 'll get along better with this . " Matto nodded at Cinelli and then at the cane cradled in his right hand , let himself lean on it , testing , before he limped into the wet street . Cinelli switched off his lights , set the alaii buzzer , and decided , while locking the grate , against entering the gift of the cane in his voluminous ledger . When they auction off all this junk , it wo n't even cover a year 's rent on my plot . Who 'll miss one cane ? ioi3:22-3:30 Three-legged now , limping through intermittent drizzle , april 7 , 1965 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stiffening against their raucous voices he shuts his nose to their smell , his clenched right hand on his cane forces passage through the crowd 's center . Usually he was shy of contact , but today he barged through , knocking raincoats , slippery cord jackets , once a fragment of jutting tit , did he aim high ? " Watch it , old man ! " But he would n't waste words , burst through the crowd 's rim before he realized they were all grouped around Furco , cowering against the shoemaker 's window . His lower jaw limp , hands scrabbling in his pockets , shoulders so slumped his suede jacket collar rode high over his D.A . Two of them his challengers , the shorter one very light-skinned but neither as tall as Furco . On the fringe of the crowd , tense white faces , he recognized Furco 's friends . Why the hell did n't they help him out ? NEIGHBORHOOD Whenever you need a couple of yards you give the ball to Furco . LEGENDHe led our gang as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those Spics from the Strip came over he busted at least three arms . It 's not just his looks , he 's got a reputation to maintain . Any girl he takes out knows she 's got a white name in the neighborhood : We could never persuade him to sing in the choir . But he 's always conducted himself like a gentleman . " Call two against one fair ? " Matto mumbled , itching to swing his cane against black heads . Furco 's eyes were shifting constantly to avoid the stares of the sullen crowd . Too quiet . " You should 've kept your mouth shut , " one of the two103crowding Furco said . " Nobody was pressuring you , you could 've kept your mouth shut . " Furco shook his head . " I did n't say anything . " Somebody snickered . Shuffling feet scraping damp pavement , rustle of rainclothes , they edged forward , squeezing him , what the hell was he doing there , a workingman with a bum knee ? " Gim me some room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took refuge in the milliner 's doorway . Rows of narrowed eyes in set faces , scowling , examined him briefly before turning back to Furco . Who was sweating now , pinned against the window , the smaller one shaking his head as he slapped his fist into his palm . " They should cut your tongue outa your mouth , Furco ! Hurley 's gon na get at least two years on account of you . " A girl 's voice , scorn for Furco , another useless target , meanwhileHurley was out of circulation , Hurley was n't her man but another one sent up , locked away , come back two years later looking ten years older and for what ? The same load of crap ! And all we got is another white boy crawling in the gutter , swearing his hands are clean . " Look , you got me wrong ! I did n't do it . Hurley was my friend too , I did n't want him to get sent up . I did n't do it . I never said a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , I did n't say anything . May God strike me dead if I 'm lying  --  I did n't do it ! " Matto watched his suede jacket soak up puddle water as he groveled . " Sounds like a sick dog . " Girl clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth and Matto realized that Furco had saved himself . " Get up , goddam you ! Get up , you yellow bastard ! " 104They could n't stoke their anger . Trying to glare at him , begging , on his knees . Shrugged their shoulders . Furco 's arms shielded his face , quivered from kicks he expected momentarily , too stricken to realize his fear had pulled him through . " I did n't say anything , I did n't , you got ta believe me , guys , I swear to God I never said anything ! " The same girl released them into embarrassed clumps , turning their backs and shaking their heads as they edged away from the shoemaker 's window . " Let him crawl . No point stomping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Furco still on his knees , a steadying hand to hoist him up and wipe off the mud that coated him . Instead he knocked a smashed cardboard milk carton over the crumbling lip of curb into the gutter with the rubber tip of Cinelli 's cane before limping across the street . Even their blood stinks . Louie 's brother could n't get the smell off his jacket , I threw my pants away . As soon as we turned into his block all their radios started playing , they were waiting for us . But it did n't do him no good , we hadda go over the roofs but we caught him , Louie 's gun in his neck while we broke his arms . Jesus rot your soul in hell , he kept screaming , until we bashed in his nose and his blood choked him . He was supposed to be tough . Slipping some tramp our money for her kids . Probably his kids . Next time you wan na play Santa Claus , use your ou'n money , Louie said , he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't stand the smell . " Get outa my way ! " Matto mumbles , brushing a slight Chinese boy and then recoiling off a covey of Negro girls ; 105surly , they ignored him , tossing kerchiefed heads as he shifted behind them . " Goddammit , you let me through ! " " Take it easy , mister , who you pushing ? " Nostrils flaring she turns on him , high cheekbones , high arching breasts . " Push you right on your fucking black ass , " he mumbles , lower than she can hear , a twitch in his forearm almost sends his hand jamming into her tits , but as the other girls bunch behind her , he slides past her shoulder into the street , a truck squeals to a stop but the driver , seeing his cane , checks his curses . " Ah , forget it , Dolores , the guy 's crippled . " " Oh yeah ? Well he still got no right to push me like that ! " When the Durwent , off Curacao , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she ? Why did they pick me , I was n't the only one had the keys . The milk I brought she used for her baby , I saw her . Holding her breasts with her fingers for me . " No , not beautiful , bad , like snakes , dry , no milk for my baby . " Nigger baby , so black against her , crying until she opened one of the cans I brought , a whole crateful , and got my milk into a bottle . Then he came in . I did n't understand . Even after he said he knew I carried a key to the stockroom , I did n't believe it . She could do that ? His baby ? She called me Angel , when she had me inside her she made such sounds , I felt like a king ! She could do that ? None of the others could make such sounds . But they did it , the two of them , they made the trap for me . He knew what taverns I always went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Any man would fall for her . For her . They did it for her . For her baby . His baby . Their baby . They told me not to fight him but I knew I had to kill him . They told me he was good with a knife but I thought the Lord would help me kill him , after what they did to me . But they said he could 've killed me , after thero6second cut I could n't see , on my knees with fire burning my ribs , they said he spit on his knife and threw it overboard . They kicked him off the ship but she was back there waiting for him. 1073:30-6:10 " My daughter-in-law called up the other day , she says myapril 7 , 1965 grandson do n't wan na go to school any more , just sits home and plays his drums all day long . You ever hear anything so crazy ? " And as Matto shook his head , toying with his last few swallows of the coffee they always served him for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they told him , after all , you 're practically a charter member ) . " You sure you do n't wan na try a game or two ? " Nobody remembered he did n't play dominoes . He shook his head , watching Caruso 's stubby fingers fondle the white-dotted rectangles , arranging patterns to outwit himself , nobody to accommodate him . " I ca n't play . Never learned how . " Once the Vitello Social and Athletic Club had fielded a touch-football team , complete with substitutes , and playeda basketball league every Wednesday evening where uniforms were compulsory . As well as dances most Saturday nights of the season , and a semi-formal in St. Aloysius 's Hall every three months . Matto had once been nominated for assistant sergeant-at-arms ; his pulse raced during the balloting , dreaming of standing , sentinel-stiff at the door , decorated with the crimson and white ribbon of office . But Parisi 's brother-in-law won , they did n't announce the tallies because they were embarrassed nobody else voted for Matto . Now only the domino players remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt photo-portrait in its tarnished gilt frame , only Kennedy stared from the peeling walls , black borders wreathing his square jawed intensity . Matto , glancing now at the small dead eyes below the boyish lock of hair , wondered , as always , whether it was somebody 's son killed in the war . " You hear what they 're trying to pull now ? " Caruso shook109his head . " Wan na take over a school uptown . Run it themselves . So they can teach all the little monkeys breaking and entering . I met Louisa in Rocky 's the other day , she says she 's trying to pull some strings to get into the new projects near First Avenue , the Counselor promised to help . Everybody 's fed up in her building , they got storm windows and police locks and iron bars on all the windows and still five people were broken into , last month alone . And they do n't just take what they want any more , either . They tear up the whole apartment . For spite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired out of the club 's diminishing treasury clumped paston floppy felt slippers , lugging her bucket and rags to the front window . Matto smelled the thin ammonia mixture as some of the bluish liquid sloshed over the bucket 's side and trickled along the floorboards ; when Caruso turned back to his table to nurse his dominoes , Matto closed his eyes . His Aunt Carrie used ammonia to scrub her windows without arope looping her thick waist securely to Geracimo 's iron bedsteadand her kitchen table . Clean white kerchief , once her grandmother 's dishtowel , knotted at the base of her thick bun of gray hair , lower window wedged firmly down on her thick knees , she straddled the narrow ledge and wiped , methodically . " I do n't look down and I do n't think about it , " she explained to Matto , bunching the flesh of the back of his neck to squeeze , like a kitten 's . " Anybody could keep their balance , it 's all in the head . " After she gave the front window a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lone neon display'Tobulb before she switched on the club 's interior lights . Matto blinked in the sudden yellow haze while Caruso stared glumly at the light above their table , tatters of festive shade scorched as the bulb swung feebly on the end of its cord . " Never have any dances any more , like we used to in the old days . Dutch , you used to dance , you came here all the time with a goodlookingyoung one on your arm , you used to tear up the dance floor . " Matto lets Caruso thump his shoulder , watches Caruso 's phlegm coat the table top as he wheezes noiseless laughter and nods agreement , although he never learned to dance , the one girl he brought to the club was too shy to teach him . If she knew . They sat at the most secluded table , shaded in half-light , far from the crowded dance floor , each time he glanced at her she smiled , tremulously . Nobody had ever taken her to the club before , almost no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother and flowers for , her wrapped proudly in a green swirl of crinkly paper . The night crew quit teasing him , Matto ready to tie the knot and why not , he was certainly taking home enough and the girl was innocent , docile , pathetically eager to please . " You do whatever he wants , " her mother warned her . " Even if he talks about you to the whole neighborhood , it 's better than being an old maid . Besides he 's the kind that keeps his mouth shut . " Her mother also guessed he was incapable of taking advantage so they ceded him the front parlor , took to bed after dinner every Saturday night prepared to shut their cars to whatever squeaking menaced the worn springs of the horsehair sofa . Matto barely touched her . Money constantly in pocket , he bought himself his first new suit and a pair of blue suede shoes , pointy toes but no alligator trim , he 'd consulted with JeffIIIwho 'd advised against flashiness . Savored his stomach 's jitters as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot the fat V of his tie and anchor it securely beneath his bobbing Adam 's apple with the trim point of a gold collar pin , enjoying the luxurious slip of the white-on-white shirt against his scarred forearms . Hair cream and after-shave lotion and approval from the boys at Tony 's , a quick beer before picking her up , he 'd sworn off hard liquor and smelled like a youngish man with prospects who 'd sampled the world before deciding to settle down . Nobody deciphered her name from his mumbled introductions , but they all decided she adored him , her timidity passed for affection . When he bent to kiss her she closed her eyes and submitted ; though his hands could gentle quivering small animals he could never stop the shivers which furrowed her back till he released her , granting the warmth of his companionable arm wherein she snuggled , relieved . She was afraid to fail hint , nobody had ever taught her how to kiss and he had known so many girls , would he laugh if she confessed ? She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked him cookies and brought him sandwiches for his long night 's work which he accepted without trying to describe the feasts Al cooked for them . Once he started to tell her just how different she was from the other women he 'd known but he stammered , stared at his carefully brushed suede shoes and finally suggested they go uptown , she 'd never been to Radio City . ( Afterwards she told her mother he had almost proposed . ) Once at the circus she clapped her hands and squealed with delight as the spotlights circled the bareback team , girls in sequined tights , twinkling bells on prancing white horses . Pressure mounted on him , motherII2constantly extolling the girl 's domestic accomplishments , with more experience Matto would 've recognized the father 's beleaguered countenance as warning that he was being prodded to deliver the coup de grace . " When 's the wedding bells , Dutch ? " the crew always asked , usually he blushed . Nights he worked he considered whether he wanted a woman to live through years with , someone you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could show her how . Iron his shirts and dust her mother 's furniture which had already , tactfully , been offered ; fry his eggs every morning and confess , tearfully , that she 'd lost one of his new green socks in the wash . A hint of mustache spoiled her lip line but her mother brushed a hundred strokes into her hair every evening , Matto daydreamedof nuzzling through that thickness to lick the taut skin of her back and gently ease her over as her tentative hands wandered through his hair and finally passionate , guided him . But he never told her . Or touched her . And after the Polack squealed he was too ashamed to explain . Her mother guessed a man like him would never leave the neighborhood , the girl could 've found him and explained that it did n't matter . He would 've kissed her tiny feet and married her as fast as St. Aloysius 's could 've arranged it . Maybe . But her mother decided he was no longer suitable , an old maid was preferable to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble life under Matto 's gentle hands was extinguished . She let them consign him . And her . They all forgot Matto 's girl , he always mumbled her name and her face was too plain . Matto avoided the block she lived on and the tiny park where she sat with the neighborhood mothers , plagued by a nagging conviction that he was her last chance. 113Heavy scrape of his chair as Caruso pushed himself up after jumbling all the dominoes into their worn cheesebox holder . " I 'm going , Dutch . Got ta feed the dog and catch up on the paper . Take it easy . " Matto nodded , wondering where he fed to keep that stomach . No one else would come in till after dinner . He dozed for another half-hour , shook himself awake , pushed out of his chair and limped across the street toward Tony's. 114saturday night Shoved at cold hands kneading his side , then squirmed acrossjuly io , 1965 cushions , his toenails catching and scratching snags of worn brocade . Burrowing into an unfamiliar pillow Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some objection to the dishes which meant they were still stacked into the sink , to be washed before shaving in the morning . Or no hot water . " Fuck it , " he mumbled and rolled over again . " Hey , c'm on , move over ! Let me in . You were hot enough to get me into bed a couple of hours ago ! " Slippery muslim or gauze over warm flesh but cold hands prodded him , rolled him over , pinned against fabric , what the hell happened to the bed ? What 're you doing home so early , he thought to ask , though Laurie never wore nightgowns and there was a taste of somethinggummy in his mouth that he could sniff on whoever was squirming next to him . " I ca n't make my tongue work , how the hell did my mouth get so gummed up ? What time is it ? " She giggled and he heard Nikky 's laugh caught in her throatiness . " Must be four . At least . I hadda wait to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes to work up his big bubbly snore but once he starts hitting those long Z 's you could bite his ear off and he would n't wake up . " So only a thickness of wall away , in Angie 's musty bedroom , Sal was wrapped in flowered sheets next to a tangle of bedclothes . Maybe his arm nuzzled a pillow for companionship ? The kid shivered . " You really take some chances . You 're lucky Sal do n't drink that sweet stuff , he gets a hell of a lot meaner than you when he 's really pissed . " Warm breath into the folds of his neck , almost absently she licked at his ear but already her hands were busy . " That 's why I told you to buy it . You always11ssaid you liked Marsala and I figured he would n't touch it . " Sal had actually dozed off halfway through her story , when she finished she kicked him awake . " Before we hit the sack I think I would like a little nightcap , for a celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I think if one of you gets up off his ass you could make Nino 's before he closes , I 'll even lay out the money . Make sure it 's something sweet , " she shouted , the kid was already bouncing down the steps , humming ; if whatever she had in mind needed stimulus then he was pleased to supply it . They started by drinking it on the rocks , both of them grinning at Sal 's grumpy refusal . " Look at him already taking his shoes and socks off , that 's really getting domestic . " Sal , head lolling , stretched the weight of his bunched shoulder muscles and glanced sheepishly down at his shoes ; the kid watched his face ease into weariness and , ashamed , decided to lay off . But Angie had a scene she was trying to provoke . " Why do n't you curl up on the couch and watch some television ? Nikky 's not ready for bed yet . " They drank too quickly after Sal padded across to flop on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet and tumbled across him as they weaved through furniture . Angie tried to lead him in a parody of a tango ended by his stumble over Nikky 's medicine chest . He wrestled Angie down as he sprawled , bedroom curtains blocking Sal 's view from the couch as Nikky howled for her toys . " Ca n't you get rid of him somehow ? Just for tonight ? " Handful of ample tit but his other hand , fumbling for her crotch , deflected ; warm furry tongue in his ear for reward . " Behave yourself . " Whispered . And then shouted : Jesus Christ , you goddam clumsy bastard , you almost ripped my housecoat ! Nikky shut up , for Chrissake , your116doctor 's cabinet 's made of iron , he could n't break it if he ran over it with a garbage truck ! " " It 's not iron it 's only made of tin ! And he 's already made a great big dent in it ! " Sobbing , she consented to be gathered to Angelina 's breast to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the kid lurched into the living room to collapse into an armchair . Sal bulked a dull menace from the couch , somebody had shut the sound off but the tube still flickered , a much bluer light than usual but the kid could n't focus the image . " Such an interesting picture . What did people use to get themselves to sleep before the late-night movies ? " " Why do n't you go home ? You 're a pain in the ass sober and a pain in the ass drunk . It looks like you ca n't even hold your wine , let alone your liquor . Nikky 's asleep and Angie wants some sleep . Why do n't you go upstairs where you belong ? " " You wan na go to bed you go to bed , but do n't you decide when I 'm ready for bed , " Angie shouted at Sal . " I make up my own mind in this apartment , who the hell are you to throw your weight around ? You do n't own me and you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I did n't put in a sixteenhourshift just to take his lip ! I 'm tired ! I think he 's a pain in the ass , I need to ask your permission before I kick him out ? " " You got the right to use your gun , off duty as well as on , as long as you show your badge first or in some way identify yourself . If the suspect is fleeing , order him to halt in a commandingvoice and identify yourself as an officer of the law. 117was already moist , her soft hair matted . " He was so pissed off he could hardly talk , " she whispered into his ear , shivers down his half-drugged nerves toward the small of his back as she worked him , fingers nibbling his nipples , his ribs , down the slope of his stomach to his thighs . Somewhere a reflex reminded him she liked him passive , small choice at this hour . " I never seen him like that before , I got into bed and he stood by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window . I let him wait , I could almost hear him trying to figure out what to say . Finally I gave up waiting for him to decide . You 're not a horse , ' I said to him , you never learned to sleep on your feet , for Chrissake get into bed and stop brooding . I 'm just disgusted with both of you , that 's all . ' When he finally climbed in he turned his face to the wall like he did n't intend to have anything to do with me . I changed his mind fast enough . " Triumphant , she giggled . The best of both worlds , he thought , took his time . She stayed on the couch with him till dawn for reward , finally kissed his forehead and rearranged his blanket , tucking him in , ridges of frayed cushion creasing his stomach , before tiptoeing back to Sal 's snores . What penance , he thought , and yawned , careful not to cramp his neck muscles till they locked . This ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I can manage to pick up the pieces . " Who 's Nikky ? " Maybe she even prodded my ribs with a precise forefinger , I woke up like a shot , tremors in my neck sounding alarms , I faked grogginess . " Huh ? " Do even my dreams turn traitor ? " You were mumbling something about Nikky when I came in . " Squinting at the light she finally switches on , little-girl dress I hate slips over her shoulders , always relieved to see her " 9flat stomach appear beneath it , they ever ask you at work how many months ? " Nikky ? Nikky who ? " " I do n't know Nikky who , that 's why I asked . You were mumbling Nikky , like a curse , just as I started to switch the light on , you were so clear I thought you were talking to me and then I listened but it was just Nikky Nikky Nikky . You were very angry at her . " Angelina talking through my dreams , scolding ? But I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carefully shrugging her spiky shoulders . " Should I be ? " Touche for you , my love , you found the right counter and turned away to lay out your morning clothes , another of my suggestions you fought till I was forced to convince you it was eminently sensible . Drifting toward his threshold he watched her scrabble awake , blinded chick , soap tearing her eyes , botched makeup , at least lay your clothes out the night before so the subway people do n't discover you 're wearing my socks ! Only Harrison 's filter-paper coffee finally woke her . He reminded himself to stay awake , attentive , stifle his weariness enough to grant her due with his flesh in order to settle any hovering suspicions ; luckily , he thought , why bother to stifle the ripple of pride which swelled him momentarily , I can always manage . Dawn was staining Angie 's curtains . He yawned . She pecked me so softly before she padded in to Sal maybe she 'll fix me breakfast before I climb upstairs . No hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . What haunts Laurie ? She still lets me get away with every little game I play . I wait for her to sink her nails into my shoulders , turn me around to face her anguished stare . " Just what do you think you 're trying to do to me ? " Dozing now , he barely registered first bird cries . " Hey . Wake up . C'm on , wake up ! " 120Dirty light under his eyelids . " Go away . Go away and let me sleep . My head hurts . " " C'm on , c'm on wake up . " Shaking him roughly , nails into his shoulders . " It 's still early , hurry up , let 's get back into bed . Sal 's gone . I guess I woke him up climbing back in , or maybe he never really went to sleep , maybe he faked all that snoring to find out what we were up to . I yawned and pretended I was dead tired but I could feel him rigid beside me , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of a thing to say . Finally he got up and put his clothes on and did n't even look at me , he tiptoed out so he would n't wake Nikky . He did n't even slam the door . " Later , joints screaming after another bout he swore he could n't complete and completed anyway , through her ministrations and an edge of something close to panic which made her desperate , he locked his fingers under the crown of his head and watched her body barely stirring in sleep . Only an hour or two till Nikky wakes up , and Angie already thinking she 'd made a mistake to let Sal go . Nothing to look forward to , he considered gathering up his clothes and heading upstairs , at least he 'd be guaranteed uninterrupted sleep . Could n't have two men walking out on her in one night . He yawned and turned away , Carson was right to chew my ass out . My work is falling apart , I ca n't even keep my Residuals filed . And while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention my hours . Erratic . Would n't dispute that , Carson . So I mumbled about strain , home pressures , hardly getting any sleep at night , keepingmy eyes on the scuffed tips of my working shoes , do n't enjoy airing my dirty linen . You never used to mumble , sheI2Isnapped at me , now you sneak around this place like you got acne , what 's happening to you ? Carson , I 'll send you a memo . Just the usual kinds of troubles . She sniffed , not convinced . Usual troubles do n't affect you like they do most people , I suppose . You 're really coming apart at the seams . Listen , you want a couple of days ' sick leave ? Get broiled on some beach , give your head a rest ? I could even cover for you at home if it 's necessary , you figure out how to explain your tan when you get back . I 'd thought about it before . Nah , it 's not worth it , Carson , I 'd peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instead of trying to think my way out of this I 'd probably spend all my time trying to bed somebody I 'd hate as soon as I 'd had her . I do n't know how to get out of this . And then , carefully : Maybe you could figure out where I could get some free therapy ? It might help . She nodded , measuring me . Sure . I could probably chisel my therapist to give you a reduction . Like ten bucks an hour . That 's half what I pay , you 'd have to guarantee to be twice as interesting . No problem , he 'd said immediately , and then , realizing the judgment , tried to backtrack . I mean , the content 's a lot more sordid . She only laughed at him , he could never guess what would cause offense . You take care of yourself . She waved a finger at him as he nodded out her office door . I mean it , I worry about you . She does mean it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she sees . What do I look like to Carson ? Would it help me to know ? And woke with a jolt , tumbling off some bridge again , stomach grounding him . It ca n't last . Even if Sal keeps his mouth shut , half the neighborhood must be wise , Angie 's got girlfriends she . spends hours with in the beauty parlor . And Nikky ? Does Nikky babble to her play-122mates about the men she discovers sharing her mother 's bed ? Why do I bother to propitiate her , I ca n't stand the way she minces . Angie 's made her into a little bitch and then she turns on me when I play up to her . Cute ? You give me a pain in the ass . Whatta you know about it , you look at her ass in that little red sunsuit and all you can think of is whether she 'll have hot pants for you by the time she 's thirteen . You tease her like she already knows what she 's got , and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special because she plays up to you now , a month after you move outa the neighborhood she wo n't even remember your name . A threat or a promise ? Probably neither . Moreover she was accurate , something about the wiggle of Nikky 's buttocks when she squirmed over me aroused me to visions of tasting her tiny but damp slit and then corkscrewing my tongue up her dainty anus . But other times I was convinced it was her need for me or somebody whose shoes I barely filled to which I responded ; what about those nights when , too prickly to sleep , I watched by Nikky 's cot to catch her dreams before they tumbled her up and woke her , sobbing for Angie ? Having despaired of Laurie 's complications , was I choosing a hand-me-down , a bastard through whom to play out my fantasiesof fatherhood ? Whatever I was doing , she always responded , cradled her head on my shoulder and nuzzled her damp cheeks against my neck , even murmured my name as I eased her into bed without waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and let me stroke her till her sobbing ceased , before her head burrowed into the warm hollowsof Angelina 's body ? If , in her rootings , her tiny ass occasionallygrazed my swelling , can I really be blamed ? Men commit unthinkable acts with far less provocation , but night123after night I played the gray foster father , anonymous comforter , I did my duty without caring whether Nikky realized whose neck she nuzzled on her easy passage to motherflesh . How many nights did Sal get seduced by sudden intimations of parentage ? Maybe Nikky 's sobbing never woke him , chainsaw sleeper , Angelina awake and squirming out of her stripy sheets to pad across her linoleum , scoop Nikky up and bundle her into bed before he ever fought clear of the weariness blanketing him . In the morning he found himself part of a trio , how the hell did Nikky wind up in bed with us ? Did Angie play her cat 's games with Sal , or was it only in me she sensed how much the child excited ? Cuddling Nikky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow signaled her safely dreaming , Angelina 's small but cunning hand crept down to me and stroked , teased , cupped and molded till I was taut and throbbing , locked against the innocent restraint of Nikky 's midget rump and thighs . I never reached out to touch her face but I could sense her grin as she savored my helplessness  --  did Sal also honor Nikky 's sleep ? Some nights she worked so zealously to rouse me she also stirred herself ; then she 'd ease over Nikky to yield me a back entrance . But the sigh as I finally slipped myself in was shared , for when my hands , bored with the soft ridges of her shoulder muscles or the birthmarks dotting her back , reached round to cup and fondle her breasts , they found either a tell-tale wet on distended nipples or Nikky 's head still fastened , her lips sucking in time to my strokes . Often two pairs of hands traced Nikky 's frail shoulders or caressed the soft tangles of her curls , our fingers joined in her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and armpits , the tiny bumps of her spine . What legacy , for Nikky , some124shrink may someday reveal , but what harvest for me , never gathered with Laurie ? Waiting for Nikky 's awakening whimper he finally fell asleep . Below him in the streets another Matto limps home , unde-tected-SAL Fifty men was on duty downtown-east that night , same 's any other . On the streets , slapping their hands together , cruising in squad cars , not to mention the all-night guys at the precincts or staffing Control at Headquarters . Fifty guys out on the street , any hour of the morning , whatta they see ? Evil incarnate ? Nah , mostly drunks . Call ' em in , mark ' em on the chart , seven o'clock milkman 's run will sweep them all in , a shower and a meal . Department 's catering service , sleep it off Mac , get sobered up for thirty days in the workhouse . Somebody calls in a silhouette in a warehouse window . But it turns out to be the night watchman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared shitless . Maybe three , maybe four murders a night . And a thousand guys exactly like him walking the streets , suppose we stop each one and shake him down , whatta we learn ? We ai n't mindreadersand we do n't play our hunches . We let him go . We let almost everybody go. and the kid tiptoes into the bathroom , dried sperm flaking off as he guides his piss . Do n't flush the toilet ! Water pipes rise through three more apartments to the roof , a latticework of pipes and joints honeycombing the building : Serafina kneeling by her bed fumbling over her beads , Rosie knitting under an unshaded lampbulb , Angelo shivering in his top bunk with his blankets tangled in the railings . The kid tapped himself dry thinking Matto 's building was noisier , steam clanged through125his busted pipes , and his knee might 've throbbed so bad he could n't sleep nights . ANGELINA Plenty of people ca n't sleep nights , he do n't deserve special consideration . He was a loser , buster , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at Tony 's , in her black belted raincoat she always turned heads when she pushed through the door , chorus of , " Angie , baby ! " but only a cool nod for answer . " The girl 's got guts , you got ta hand it to her . " " I 'd like to hand it to her , right on the counter , sling her ass up , prop her back against those hogsheads , wrap those legs around me and whale it into her . " " Uh-uh , buddy , that 's only for New York 's finest , you got ta be wearing a badge . " Knowing what they saw and sniggered after , but satisfied as long as they granted her quick passage to the bar , no fat hands snaking out to graze a tit or fondle a buttock , she sips her gin-and-tonic , Sal 's influence , used to chug down straight Scotch until he told her the least she could do was to drink like a lady . I seen him plenty of times down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve of the bar closest to the door , and he always huddled into himself like a turtle , his elbows cradling his head . We called him Dutch because he 'd fight like hell before he 'd let you buy him anything , one beer was his limit . I tried to make him memorize the roads down to Baltimore once , he was thinking of hitch-hiking but he could n't remember the route numbers . I only found out the following Christmas he actually made it down there . Say more than hello and he 'd blush , you could paralyze him by touching his shoulder , he could n't look a woman in the face withoutstammering . LAURIE ( Staring out the window as the train plods south from Harrison 's place outside New Rochelle , water tanks and frame houses slipping126past ) From what the papers said he seemed like such a dismal sort of man . ANGELINA He was always skinny , always . You know what he eats ? C'mere , I 'll show you . ( In front of Joe 's , her raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she beckons through the grimy , steamcoatedwindow . ) Coffee . That 's what he lives on . Coffee and a roll for breakfast , coffee and a ham sandwich for lunch , soup and coffee for dinner . He 'll nurse that coffee for hours , does he ever talk to you ? JOE I would n't exactly call it talk . We do a routine that 's a little better than grunting at each other , I would say occasionally words get exchanged . But he ai n't messy , though , he 's a careful eater , never spills nothing , hands me his dishes over the counter and wipes up his place which I always tell him not to bother with , I think he feels bad he ca n't leave me no tip . The times when he ai n't working he avoids my place , I have to catch him on the street and force him inside to eat a meal on the cuff One winter he ate off me for three weeks while he was n't working and soon 's he 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rings torn like some kid ripped it out of his notebook , with all the meals he ate every day for three weeks written down with the prices besides them . " The only thing I did n't know , " he says , " one Friday morning you made me French toast , it 's not listed on the menu . " LAURIE I thought he could n't read . SAL The boys always took care of him , he should 've known he 'd never starve . As soon as he banged up his knee they put him on the Express crew at the warehouse. 127CARBONE Not because we felt sorry for him . He tried harder to keep his mind on what he was doing he woulda saved himself a lotta misery . ( Peak tilted on his red hunting cap , flannel shirt soaked with sweat as he slaps a gloved hand on the worn ridge of the concrete loading platform . ) We were just protecting ourselves . Wherever he thought that goddam liquor came from , he saw damn well it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He keeps wandering around the neighborhoodwith that bum knee and he gets hungry , anybody who wants some cheap information can buy him right off the sidewalk . Even the fuzz . Especially the fuzz . Not that he 'd open his mouth so easy , especially for the kind of dough the fuzz shell out , but if he ai n't working he 's got ta buy his eats somehow . SAL ( Out of uniform in a housing project playground ) We never shell out a penny more than we have to , you 'd be surprised how much informationwe get for nothing . Most people like to talk , especially to us , and we got our ways of encouraging the ones who do n't . We run a heavier payroll than in the old days , but that 's because there 's so many new types to keep tabs on . ( Prods a little man in a zipped-up windbreaker . ) What do you know about Matto ? MAN ( Shrugging ) Who watches a guy like him ? LAURIE ( On her roof shaking damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines where they billow and flap ) You always think we do n't appreciate you , but when it comes down to it , you do n't know very much . SAL Lady , whatta you know about anything ? We 're holding the city together ! 128LAURIE Not for me ! ANGELINA Bullshit ! How come you always take cabs after midnight ? SAL Lissen , you seen his picture maybe three times in the paper You wan na tell me which one of these three guys is him ? men , two holding hats in their hands , stare dumbly out tl circle of lights . They try not to blink . ) Stand up straight then ber Two ! Well ? You wan na see profile ? LAURIE ( Over the phone , nervously ) This is so silly , they plaster t ber all over New York and the one time I have to dial it remember .

We got our ways . Eventually we 'll have something on everybody , the city 'll move or stop because we tell it to . You worry a lot in cabs ? ( Laurie gropes her way out of the deserted skeleton of Penn Station , past the wrecking crew 's scaffolding , her heels skidding over the temporary planking covering the sidewalk . She whirls her white plastic rainhat at an off-duty cab streaking south for Brooklyn . His brakes squeal . " I 'm going downtown . Downtown ! " she screeches . He looks her over while she stammers her address . ) NA Big surly buck . Not bad looking , as they come .

But you do n't even know enough to do that , so just sit there biting your nails , hoping he does n't realize how nervous you are . What are you gon na be able to tell us if he do n't kill you ? tIE I knew something was wrong when he kept turning right , toward the130river . When he pulled up at the warehouse I wanted to scream at him THIS IS N'T MY BUILDING ! But my throat was so dry ! I thought about yanking the door handle open and running , but then he said he just wanted to check a tire , so I swallowed and waited . When he climbed into the back seat I tried to scream but there was no one around and he got his hand over my mouth so quickly ! I could smell cigarettes on his fingers . I scratched him and scratched him and then he hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my head . I could n't see . I gave up . I kept trying not to think . He was so big . I could n't move . After he was still I opened my eyes , he wanted me to see the knife before he used it . He must 've stabbed me about twenty times , I was dead before he pushed me out of the cab . ANGELINA How come you let your wife come home so late by herself ? In the old country men looked after their women . The worst thing is , I 'll bet she enjoyed it . And besides , she says as the kid begins to drift upwards , layers of landscape dissolve beneath him , it 's your dream . Momentarily he reaches up toward wakefulness and groggy , tries to cry out , but before he can open his mouth he is dozing again. 1316:25-8:10 A quiet night at Tony 's means only half the Counselor 's boysapril 7 , 1965 at the polished bar , amateurs ringing the pool table holler for more chalk , couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club sandwiches because the boys at the bar always buy them beer and even a few hard ones which never quite kill the smell off their uniforms . Four up-to-date licenses taped to his fogged mirror . " Hey , Dutch ! How'sa boy ? " NEIGHBORHOOD Nobody owns Tony . If he likes you , he 'll carry you for a month , LEGEND maybe longer ; you 'll never find out why . You need bail money he do n't charge you to per cent , and he 's got his own lines to the precinct . But do n't ever try to cross him . He ran an open house straight through the thirties , Parisi 's boys and the Glasser mob made a deal at his back tables , but lots of little guys after a fast buck are pushing concrete at the bottom of the river . Tony 's a survivor . Off-nights he occasionally occupies a tiny back table with only one chair , nobody offends by trying to join him . Nods affably to new and older customers alike , fifteen years ago he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass , guaranteed sanitary , without paying for it , and Anselmo 's brother handles his tax returns from an uptown office . Chin resting on his crossed elbows Matto sniffed , swallowed , lump compressing a tickle in his throat . No perfume . Parisi 's blonde only showed up three nights a week , he could never remember which . " I 'll buy you a beer , " he managed once . " Sure , " she grinned , she could buy him and half the bar , but accepted , clinked his glass and granted him a demure but conspiratorial wink . A real lady . When she smiled and nodded to him , because she could never remember what the boysX3 ' 3called him , he nodded back gravely while his groin throbbed . Once at the rim of a crowd watching the pro finals he grazed her tit with his elbow , but she did n't notice . He thought . Spongy , resilient , the Swede girl had younger breasts easily as big and never wore a bra ; in the humid stable mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and callused hands fumbled under her heavy sweater . Or her father 's lumberjacket she took for a cloak when she crept barefoot across the yard to his cabin . Father met Matto market day in Pendleton and stared at his hands while Matto stammered an explanation of where he 'd worked , hired him as soon as Matto dried up , no questions asked . Matto had learned another trade , one-family setups where he hand-milked twenty cows twice a day and ranches where with a dozen other hands he shepherded whole herds through the milking machines . Bought grain , stored feed , shifted straw , tended cracked hooves , assisted at calf births , trucked giant milk jugs to market , spooned down thick bubblingoatmeal in white-washed bunkhouses . Winter the smell from a wood fire curing bacon in a smokehouse carries miles over snow , air so clear you can write your name with your breath . Deep drifts marooned herds , blocked roads for the season , every farm family did their snow-shopping early in September , huge tins of vegetables , fifty-pound slabs of butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze their milk and lived off the storehouse , pancakes every morning , a thousand eggs and five hundred pounds of flour , maybe it 's monotonous but we sure as hell wo n't starve , boys . Thick columns of smoke from the lower ridges signaled giant steam plows chugging through drifts , they padded over134crusted surfaces to the boundary fence , only its tips showing , to watch the plows churn up the hills , stripping mountains of snow off the ribbon of black asphalt and slamming it into ridged barriers that imprisoned the road . Orange triangular pennant replaced the red flag flapping over the main barn as the big trucks revved up , ready to grind down-ridge to market again , fresh vegetables and a month 's worth of mail and newspapers . Matto was always chagrined when a siege ended . Spent thirty months working that spare terrain , longest stretch on the Swede 's farm , wife and one sleepy daughter . Flat-fisted thud in the gray morning light on the slatted door of the shed they fixed up for the help , they offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut it off , jangling reminded him of air-raid sirens over Luzon , he hated to remember how much money he 'd lost . Grunting , he shucked off the eiderdown and three khaki blankets , forced himself up into a shivering crouch , goatish in long underwear , groping for his clothes on the stove rack , ash still smoldering ; on a really cold morning , twenty below , fire never lasted till morning . " Coffee 's on , bub . " When water froze overnight in the pipes , chunks of ice which he splintered into his washing-pan scraped his cheeks as he rubbed , crystals trapped in his beard dripped onto her oilcloth-covered kitchen table as he sipped her steaming coffee . They never expected him to shave , beards lasted all winter . Her kitchen was always warm , and she did all the toting , never asked for help with the coal and wood , even the morning he drove her down-ridge to hospital she had their coffee steaming on the hob . Neuralgia , they told her , but she knew better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase was a speech , they left him alone but he never felt lonely . " More biscuits , son ? " He put on weight , his shoulders straightened , gradually his body toughened until he could heave a fifteen-gallon jug onto a truck bed without straining to protect the scar tissue over his right ribs . He had a knack for gentling cows the Swede sensed in his hands the moment he saw him , could n't raise his wages but offered him all the extras he could squeeze out of his own tight margins ; a second day off every other month , a radio , curtains he did n't need for his shed 's windows , the second-best cuts of meat and once a week his favorite pie for dinner and a whole extra one to take to his room . For once he stammered his thanks . The Swede wanted him to stay , his wife understood Matto was the best hand they were ever likely to find . Matto wondered , afterwards , whether the Swede had prompted his daughter but decided he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broad and big-muscled . Matto kept out of her way , no whores for hundreds of miles but he felt contained , clear mountain air . Work-weary , his flesh wanted only undisturbed sleep , his war years dropped away . " Why you always keep away from me ? " she demanded . They occasionally rubbed shoulders as they cleaned the strawmattedaisles steamy with manure and animal heat . His muscles twitched at her touch . Her father called him a good man , deep , much gentleness , but Matto saw tall blond boys ride the school bus with her every morning , watched one of them jump off and , taking her hand , stray down the path along the south ridge which crosses the creek and skirts the old hay wagon . " I 'm not your people , " he mumbled . She stared at him , wordless , light off whitewashed walls glinting pale blue136in her eyes . Two mornings later , cows shifting stolidly in fresh hay , she bit the loose skin of her wrist and seized his hand , drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the knuckles . " My teeth leave the same marks in your skin as in mine . " He tried to explain , excited but too fearful . She was too good for him , her father paid his wages , all he knew about were paid-for women . She stared at him fumbling for words . That night she creaked open the door to his shed , her father 's lumberjacket slung like a cape over her coarse flannel nightgown , knelt beside his bed so her face was level with his own on his pillow . She folded his hand in hers and kissed his knuckles , then sucked the tips of his fingers , he felt the hard biting edge of her teeth just grazing his nails . " I am a bad man for you . No good at all . I know only bad women . You must go . What can I tell your father ? " He promised himself to make her go but just to touch her hair he reached out for her . She came almost every night , waiting at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle and pulled the heavy comforter over their mammoth double bed before climbing out her bedroom window , she never dared the doors which always creaked . She lay with him till the false dawn , an hour before the first rooster crowed , then tiptoed back on bare feet across the frozen mud of the yard . He was her first , dark and lean while the others were fair-haired , blockish ; subtle curves to his limbs , scars he described in whispers , fierce passion which exulted her whenever she provokedhim , she was content . In the daytime she managed not to touch him , they guarded themselves so carefully they seemed , to the parents , hostile . Sullen and secretive . At meals the mother served , the father said grace , Matto and the girl mumbled hesitant amens . He stumbled like a sleepwalker into137i sudden riotous spring . Everything dripped , water poured Sown the upper slopes , mud caked his boots and denims , the lower paths flooded , they tended a harvest of wet-nosed , shaky calves . One night during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl carries your child ? " His mouth dry , wind caught in the double windows roaring in his ears , Matto nodded ; she 'd already told him . His ears turned red until he dropped his glance , across the table a slow flush stained her cheeks but she stared proudly at him . " You can marry in the church by the end of the month , no one will talk . You move into the guest room , there is already a double bed . " Matto was incapable of shaking his head , he stared at his hands . " The farm can be yours , after us . After we go . No one else to keep it . You know how to take care of it , it would stay in good hands , for your children to belong to after you . " That night he sweated in the cold spring air , pounded his knotted fist into his mattress , trying to find words . She understood only that he would n't stay and cried till morning , mopping her swollen face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shed as he stumbled down the pitted path to the road , a new duffle bag slung over his shoulder , he was afraid to turn and wave a final goodbye because she might burst into tears again and wake her father . " That one must be stale by now , Dutch . Try another one . " Slopping stein shoved across the bar . And at Matto 's disclaimer : " Do n't worry about it , Dutch . It 's on the house . " Pursed lips , beer already swirling in his empty stomach , Matto nodded , a sandwich or one of Tony 's quick steaks , thin shavings of meat with gristle to chew , but he would n't ask. 138Needed to piss . Usually he forgot to pull the chain . Sweating pipes , moisture on peeling walls , shaky hand on cold radiator flanges propped him as he swayed . Somebody spat a soft curse from the pool table as a shot clinked home , sharp tap of impact and metallic slide as the ball slid through netting down the chute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were about to bust the door in when somebodytried the knob which he never remembered to lock . " It 's only Dutch . " Reprieved , he shook his head , opened the door and limped into the corridor , watched Mauro bust his run with a carom which skittered off the bank and stopped three inches too short , somebody snorted as the tip of his stick tore felt . " You left your cane , Dutch . " And a fresh stein waiting for him . Swallowed more of his pride , his stomach swilling . " You got some potato chips , Eddie ? " Quick assessing glance . " Sure , Dutch . Lissen , I got something better , I got almost a whole cheese sandwich I been saving ' cause it 's a shame to throw it out , Frankie 's girl came in about five but all she could do was look at it after she ordered it , she did n't take more than a bite , she says she 's definitely going to the hospital ' cause her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you some pickle to go with it .
