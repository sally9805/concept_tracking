// Synopsis of Preceding Installment The death of Mme. Giselle took place aboard the airliner Prometheus midway between Paris and London . Suddenly she had slumped forward in her seat . She had been killed , apparently , by a poison dart shot from a blowpipe . The blowpipe was found wedged behind a seat ; the dart , after puncturing Mme. Giselle 's neck , had dropped to the floor . There could be no doubt it was murder . Investigation proved that any of half a dozen passengers might have wished Mme. Giselle out of the way . The notorious French moneylender to society , and occasional blackmailer , had few friends and many enemies . Of all the passengers , indeed , only Hercule Poirot , famous detective , could be considered as completely above suspicion . And by the time the plane had landed in London he had begun the hunt for the murderer . V As Jane left the court after the verdict , she found Norman Gale beside her . He said : " I wonder what was on that paper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can tell you , I think , " said a voice behind him . The couple turned , to look into the twinkling eyes of M. Hercule Poirot . " It was a verdict , " said the little man , " of willful murder against me . " " Oh , surely ? " cried Jane . Poirot nodded happily . " Mais oui . As I came out I heard one man say to the other : That little foreigner-mark my words  --  he done it ! ' The jury thought the same . " Jane was uncertain whether to condole or to laugh . She decided on the latter . Poirot laughed in sympathy . " But , see you , " he said , " definitely I must set to work and clear my character . " With a smile and a bow , he moved away . " Look here , " said Gale . A slight flush rose in his cheeks and he spoke rather fast : " Would you mind  --  I mean , it would be frightfully nice of you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tea with me ? I feel  --  comrades in misfortune and ? " He stopped . To himself he said : " What is the matter with you , you fool ? Ca n't you ask a girl to have a cup of tea without stammering and blushing and making an utter ass of yourself ? What will the girl think of you ? " Gale 's confusion served to accentuate Jane 's coolness and self-r ) possession " Thank you very much , " she said . " I would like some tea . " The tea shop was nearly empty . Its emptiness served to emphasize the intimacy of tea drinking together . Jane peeled off her gloves and looked across the table at her companion . He was attractive  --  those blue eyes and that smile . And he was nice too . " It 's a queer show , this murder business , " said Gale , plunging hastily into talk . He was still not quite free from an absurd feeling of embarrassment . " I know , " said Jane . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , I mean . I do n't know how they 'll take it . " " Ye-es . I had n't thought of that . " " Antoine 's may n't like to employ a girl who 's been mixed up in a murder case and had to give evidence , and all that . " " People are queer , " said Norman Gale thoughtfully . " Life 's so  --  so unfair . A thing like this that is n't your fault at all . " He frowned angrily . " It 's damnable ! " " Well , it has n't happened yet , " Jane reminded him . " No good getting hot and bothered about something that has n't happened . After all , I suppose there is some point in it ; I might be the person who murdered her ! And when you 've murdered one person , they say you usually murder a lot more ; and it would n't be very comfortable having your hair done by a person of that kind . " " Anyone 's only got to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Norman , gazing at her earnestly . 250thGAnniversar c erial Continuing one of Hercule Poirot 's most baffling challenges in this little known mystery gem by the twentieth century 's greatest practitioner of the art of deceiving and delighting  --  a Post 250th anniversary salute to Agatha Christie and her millions of fans . by Agatha Chriatfie Illustrated by Frederic Mizen " I represent the Weekly Howl , and I wondered if you 'd care to do a short article ... point of view of one of the passengers . " // - " **33;4048;TOOLONG hal " I 'm not so sure about that , " said Jane . " I 'd like to murder some of my ladies sometimes  --  if I could be sure I 'd get away with it ! There 's one in particular  --  she 's got a voice like a corn crake and she grumbles at everything . I really think sometimes that murdering her would be a good deed and not a crime at all . So you see I 'm quite criminally minded . " " Well , you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can swear to that . " " And I can swear you did n't do it , " said Jane . " But that wo n't help you if your patients think you have . " " My patients , yes . " Norman Gale looked rather thoughtful . " I suppose you 're right ; I had n't really thought about my patients ' feelings . A dentist who might be a homicidal maniac  --  no , it 's not a very alluring prospect . " He added suddenly and impulsively : " I say , you do n't mind my being a dentist , do you ? " Jane raised her eyebrows . " I ? Mind ? " " What I mean is , people seem to think there 's something rather  --  well , comic about a dentist . Somehow , it 's not a romantic profession . Now , a doctor everyone takes seriously . " " Cheer up , " said Jane . " A dentist is decidedly a cut above a hairdresser 's assistant . " They laughed and Gale said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you ? " " Yes . I think I do . " " Perhaps you 'll dine with me one night and we might do a show ? " " Thank you . " There was a pause , and then Gale said : " How did you like Le Pinet ? " " It was great fun . " " Had you ever been there before ? " " No , you see ? " Jane , suddenly confidential , came out with the story of the winning sweep ticket . They agreed together on the general romance and desirability of sweeps and deplored the attitude of an unsympathetic English government . Their conversation was interrupted by a young man in a brown suit who had been hovering uncertainly near by for some minutes before they noticed him . Now , however , he lifted his hat and addressed Jane with a certain glib assurance . " Miss Jane Grey ? " he said . " Yes . " " I represent the Weekly Howl , Miss Grey . I wondered if you would care to do us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of one of the passengers . " " I think I 'd rather not , thanks . " " Oh , come now , Miss Grey . We 'd pay well for it . " " So you may as well clear out , " said Norman Gale . " Miss Grey does n't want to be worried . " " Nothing to get annoyed about , " said the young man . " Ring me up at the office if you change your mind . Here 's my card with my telephone number . " When the young man had departed , Jane said : " I wonder why he did n't go for the more important people . " " Leaves that to his betters , probably , " said Gale grimly . " He 's probably tried there and failed . " He sat frowning for a minute or two . Then he said : " Jane  --  I 'm going to call you Jane , you do n't mind , do you ? ? Jane , who do you think really murdered this Giselle woman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know I did n't do it and I know you did n't do it because  --  well , because I was watching you most of the time . " " Yes , " said Jane . " I know you did n't do it  --  for the same reason . And of course I know I did n't do it myself ! So it must have been one of the others  --  but I do n't know which . I have n't the slightest idea . Have you ? " " No . " Norman Gale looked very thoughtful . He seemed to be puzzling out some train of thought . Jane went on : " I do n't see how we can have the least idea , either . I mean we did n't see anything  --  at least I did n't . Did you ? " Gale shook his head . " It seems so frightfully odd . I dare say you would n't have seen anything . You were n't facing that way . But I was . I was looking right along the middle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flushed . She was remembering that her eyes had been mostly fixed on a periwinkle-blue pullover , and that her mind , far from being receptive to what was going on around her , had been mainly concerned with the personality of the human being inside the periwinkle-blue pullover . Norman Gale thought : " I wonder what makes her blush like that . .. . She 's wonderful . . . . I 'm going to marry her . Yes , I am . . . . But it 's no good looking too far ahead . I 've got to have some good excuse for seeing her often . This murder business will do as well as anything else . . . . " Madame Giselle frequented fashionable French watering spots and gambling casinos , where her rich clients were sure to get into debt and need her services . // Aloud he said : " Let 's think about it now . Who killed her ? Let 's go over all the people . The stewards ? " " No , " said Jane . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't suppose anyone like Lady Horbury would go killing people . And the other one  --  Miss Kerr  --  well , she 's far too county . She would n't kill an old Frenchwoman , I 'm sure . " " Only an unpopular M. F. H. I expect you 're not far wrong , Jane . Then there 's mustachios , but he seems , according to the coroner 's jury , to be the most likely person ; so that washes him out . The doctor ? That does n't seem very likely either . " " If he 'd wanted to kill her , he could have used something quite untraceable and nobody would ever have known . " " Ye-es , " said Norman doubtfully . " These untraceable , tasteless , odorless poisons are very convenient , but I 'm a bit doubtful if they really exist . What about the little man who owned up to having a blowpipe ? " " That 's rather suspicious . But he seemed a very nice little man , and he need n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were all right . " " Then there 's Jameson  --  no , what 's his name ? ? Ryder . " " Yes , it might he him . " " And the two Frenchmen . " " That 's the most likely of all . They 've been to queer places . And of course they may have had some reason we know nothing about . I thought the younger one looked very unhappy and worried . " " You probably would be worried if you 'd committed a murder , " said Norman Gale grimly . " He looked nice , though , " said Jane . " And the old father was rather a dear . I hope it is n't them . " " We do n't seem to be getting on very fast , " said Norman Gale . " I do n't see how we can get on without knowing a lot of things about the old woman who was murdered . Enemies , and who inherits her money , and all that . " Norman Gale said thoughtfully : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolly , " Is n't it ? " " Not quite . " Gale hesitated , then went on slowly , " I have a feeling it may be useful . " Jane looked at him inquiringly . " Murder , " said Norman Gale , " does n't concern the victim and the guilty only . It affects the innocent too . You and I are innocent , but the shadow of murder has touched us . We do n't know how that shadow is going to affect our lives . " Jane was a person of cool common sense , but she shivered suddenly . " Do n't , " she said . " You make me feel afraid . " " I 'm a little afraid myself , " said Gale . VI Hercule Poirot rejoined his friend , Inspector Japp . The latter had a grin on his face . " Hullo , old boy , " he said . " You 've had a pretty near squeak of being locked up in a police cell . " " I fear , " said Poirot gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , " said Japp with a grin , " detectives do turn out to be criminals sometimes  --  in storybooks . " A tall thin man with an intelligent melancholy face joined them , and Japp introduced him . " This is Monsieur Fournier , of the Saret ? . He has come over to collaborate with us about this business . " " I think I have had the pleasure of meeting you once some years ago , M. Poirot , " said Fournier , bowing and shaking hands . " I have also heard of you from M. Giraud . " A very faint smile seemed to hover on his lips . And Poirot , who could well imagine the terms in which Giraud  --  whom he himself had been in the habit of referring to disparagingly as the " human foxhound " ? had spoken of him , permitted himself a small discreet smile in reply . " I suggest , " said Poirot , " that both you gentlemen should dine with me at my rooms . I have already invited Maitre Thibault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not object to mycollaboration with these men who may be able to help us . " " That 's all right , old fellow , " said Japp , slapping him heartily on the back . " You 're in on this on the ground floor . " " We shall be indeed honored , " murmured the Frenchman ceremoniously . " You see , " said Poirot , " as I was saying to a very charming young lady just now , I am anxious to clear my own character . " " That jury certainly did n't like the look of you , " agreed Japp , with a renewal of his grin . " Best joke I 've heard for a long time . " By common consent , no mention of the case was made during the very excellent meal which the little Belgian provided for his friends . " After all , it is possible to eat well in England , " murmured Fournier appreciatively , as he made delicate use of a thoughtfully provided toothpick . " A delicious meal , M. Poirot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " pronounced Japp . " A meal should always lie lightly on the estomac , " said Poirot . " It should not be so heavy as to paralyze thought . " " I ca n't say my stomach ever gives me much trouble , " said Inspector Japp . " But I wo n't argue the point . Well , we 'd better get down to business . I know that M. Thibault has got an appointment this evening , so I suggest that we should start by consulting him on any point that seems likely to be useful . But now let 's hear all you can tell us of this Giselle woman . " " To speak the truth , I know very little . I know her as the world knew her  --  as a public character . Of her private life as an individual I know very little . But I will say to you this : Madame Giselle was what you call in this country ' a character . ' She was unique . Of her antecedents nothing is known . I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that as a result of smallpox she lost her looks . She was  --  I am giving you my impressions  --  a woman who enjoyed power  --  she had power . She was the type of hard-headed Frenchwoman who would never allow sentiment to affect her business interests , but she had the reputation of carrying on her profession with scrupulous honesty . " He looked for assent to Fournier . That gentleman nodded his dark , melancholic head . " Yes , " he said , " she was honest , according to her lights . Yet the law could have called her to account if only evidence had been forthcoming ; but that ? " He shrugged his shoulders despondently . " It is too much to ask  --  with human nature what it is these days . " " You mean ? " " Chantage . " " Blackmail ? " echoed Japp . " Yes , blackmail of a peculiar and specialized kind . It was Madame Giselle 's custom to lend money on what I think you call in this country ' note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sums she lent and the methods of repayment , but I may tell you that she had her own methods of getting paid . " Poirot leaned forward interestedly . " As Maitre Thibault said today , Madame Giselle 's clientele lay amongst the upper and professional classes . Those classes are particularly vulnerable to the force of public opinion . Madame Giselle had her own intelligence service . It was her custom , before lending money  --  that is , in the case of a large sum  --  to collect as many facts as possible about the client in question , and her intelligence system , I may say , was an extraordinarily good one . I will echo what our friend has said  --  according to her lights , Madame Giselle was scrupulously honest . She kept faith with those who kept faith with her . I honestly believe that she has never made use of her secret knowledge to obtain money from anyone , unless that money was already owed to her . " " You mean , " said Poirot , " that this secret knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in using it she was perfectly ruthless and deaf to any finer shades of feeling . And I will tell you this , gentlemen : Her system paid ! Very , very rarely did she have to write off a bad debt . A man or woman in a prominent position would go to desperate lengths to obtain the money which would obviate a public scandal . As I say , we knew of her activities , but as for Continued on page 82 e th M continued from page 35 prosecution " ? he shrugged ? " that is a more difficult matter . Human nature is human nature . " " And supposing , " said Poirot , " that she did , as you say happened occasionally , have to write off a bad debt ? What then ? " " In that case , " said Fournier slowly , " the information she held was published , or was given to the person concerned in the matter . " There was a moment 's silence . Then Poirot said : " Financially , that did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not directly , that is . " " But indirectly ? " " Indirectly , " said Japp , " it made the others pay up , eh ? " " Exactly , " said Fournier . " It was valuable for what you call the moral effect . " " Immoral effect , I should call it , " said Japp . " Well " ? he rubbed his nose thoughtfully ? " it opens up a very pretty line in motives for murder  --  a very pretty line . Then there 's the question of who is going to come into her money . " He appealed to Thibault . " Can you help us there at all ? " " There was a daughter , " said the lawyer . " She did not live with her mother ; indeed , I fancy that her mother has never seen her since she was a tiny child . But she made a will many years ago now , leaving everything , with the exception of a small legacy to her maid , to her daughter , Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made another . " " And her fortune is large ? " asked Poirot . The lawyer shrugged his shoulders . " At a guess , eight or nine million francs . " Poirot pursed his lips to a whistle . Japp said , " Lord , she did n't look it ! Let me see . What 's the exchange ? That 's  --  why , that must be well over a hundred thousand pounds ! Whew ! " " Mademoiselle Anne Morisot will be a very wealthy young woman , " said Poirot . " Just as well she was n't on that plane , " said Japp dryly . " She might have been suspected of bumping off her mother to get the dibs . How old would she be ? " " I really can not say . I should imagine about twenty-four or five . " " Well , there does n't seem anything to connect her with the crime . We 'll have to get down to this blackmailing business . Everyone on that plane denies knowing Madame Giselle . One of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An examination of her private papers might help , eh , Fournier ? " " My friend , " said , the Frenchman , " immediately the news came through , after I had conversed with Scotland Yard on the telephone , I went straight to her house . There was a safe there containing papers . All those papers had been burned . " " Burned ? Who by ? Why ? " " Madame Giselle had a confidential maid , Elise . Elise had instructions , in the event of anything happening to her mistress , to open the safe , the combination of which she knew , and burn the contents . " " What ? But that 's amazing ! " Japp stared . " You see , " said Fournier , " Madame Giselle had her own code . She kept faith with those who kept faith with her . She gave her promise to her clients that she would deal honestly with them . She was ruthless , but she was also a woman of her word . She never broke a promise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , ruminating on the strange character of the dead woman . Maitre Thibault rose . " I must leave you , messieurs . I have an appointment . If there is any further information I can give you at any time , you know my address . " He shook hands with them ceremoniously and left the apartment . VII With the departure of Maitre Thibault , the three men drew their chairs a little closer to the table . " Now then , " said Japp , " let 's get down to it . " He unscrewed the cap of his fountain pen . " There were eleven passengers in that plane  --  inthe rear car , I mean  --  the other does n't come into it  --  eleven passengers and two stewards  --  that 's thirteen people we 've got . One of those thirteen did the old woman in . Some of the passengers were English , some were French . The latter I shall hand over to M. Fournier . The English ones I 'll take on . Then there are inquiries to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fournier . " " And not only in Paris , " said Fournier . " In the summer Giselle did a lot of business at the French watering places  --  Deauville , Le Pinet , Wimereux . She went down south , too , to Antibes and Nice and all those places . " " A good point  --  one or two of the people in the Prometheus mentioned Le Pinet , I remember . Well , that 's one line . Then we 've got to get down to the actual murder itself  --  prove who could possibly be in a position to use that blowpipe . " He unrolled a large sketch plan of the car of the aeroplane and placed it in the center of the table . " Now then , we 're ready for the preliminary work . And to begin with , let 's go through the people one by one , and decide on the probabilities and  --  even more important  --  the possibilities . " To begin with , we can eliminate M. Poirot here . That brings the number down to eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of too trustful a nature , my friend . You should trust nobody  --  nobody at all . " " Well , we 'll leave you in , if you like , " said Japp good-temperedly . " Then there are the stewards . Seems to me very unlikely it should be either of them from the probability point of view . They 're not likely to have borrowed money on a grand scale , and they 've both got a good record  --  decent sober men , both of them . It would surprise me very much if either of them had anything to do with this . On the other hand , from the possibility point of view we 've got to include them . They were up and down the car . They could actually have taken up a position from which they could have used that blowpipe  --  from the right angle , I mean  --  though I do n't believe that a steward could shoot a poisoned dart out of a blowpipe in a car full of people without someone noticing him do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bats , but there are limits . Of course , in a way , the same thing applies to every blessed person . It was madness  --  absolute madness  --  to commit a crime that way . Only about a chance in a hundred that it would come off without being spotted . The fellow that did it must have had the luck of the devil . Of all the damn-fool ways to commit a murder ? " Poirot , who had been sitting with his eyes down , smoking quietly , interposed a question : " You think it was a foolish way of committing a murder , yes ? " " Of course it was . It was absolute madness . " " And yet it succeeded . We sit here , we three , we talk about it , but we have no knowledge of who committed the crime ! That is success ! " " That 's pure luck , " argued Japp . " The murderer ought to have been spotted five or six times over . " Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that is in your mind , M. Poirot ? " " Mon ami , " said Poirot , " my point is this : An affair must be judged by its results . This affair has succeeded . That is my point . " " And yet , " said the Frenchman thoughtfully , " it seems almost a miracle . " " Miracle or no miracle , there it is , " said Japp . " We 've got the medical evidence , we 've got the weapon ? and if anyone had told me a week ago that I should be investigating a crime where a woman was killed with a poisoned dart with snake venam on it  --  well , I 'd have laughed in his face ! It 's an insult  --  that 's what this murder is  --  an insult . " He breathed deeply . Hercule Poirot smiled . " It is , perhaps , a murder committed by a person with a perverted sense of humor , " said Fournier thoughtfully . " It is most important in a crime to get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted slightly at the word " psychology , " which he disliked and mistrusted . // " That 's the sort of stuff M. Poirot likes to hear , " he said . " I am very interested , yes , in what you both say . " " You do n't doubt that she was killed that way , I suppose ? " Japp asked him suspiciously . " I know your tortuous mind . " " No , no , my friend . My mind is quite at ease on that point . The poisoned thorn that I picked up was the cause of death  --  that is quite certain . But , nevertheless , there are points about this case ? " He paused , shaking his head perplexedly . Japp went on : " Well , to get back to our Irish stew , we ca n't wash out the stewards absolutely , but I think myself it 's very unlikely that either of them had anything to do with it . Do you agree , M. Poirot ? " " Oh , you remember what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a term mon Dieu !  - -  anybody at this stage . " " Have it your own way . Now , the passengers . Let 's start up at the end by the stewards ' pantry and the toilets . Seat No. 16 . " He jabbed a pencil on the plan . " That 's the hairdressing girl , Jane Grey . Got a ticket in the Irish Sweep  --  blued it at Le Pinet . That means the girl 's a gambler . She might have been hard up and borrowed from the old dame ; does n't seem likely either that she borrowed a large sum , or that Giselle could have a hold over her . Seems rather too small a fish for what we 're looking for . And I do n't think a hairdresser 's assistant has the remotest chance of laying her hands on snake venom . They do n't use it as a hair dye or for face massage . " In a way , it was rather a mistake to use snake venom ; it narrows things down a lot . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any knowledge of it and be able to lay hands on the stuff . " " Which makes one thing , at least , perfectly clear , " said Poirot . It was Fournier who shot a quick glance of inquiry at him . Japp was busy with his own ideas . " 1 look at it like this , " he said : " The murderer has got to fall into one of two categories . Either he 's a man who 's knocked about the world in queer places  --  a man who knows something of snakes , and of the more deadly varieties , and of the habits of the native tribes who use the venom to dispose of their enemies . That 's Category No.1 . " " And the other ? " " The scientific line . Research . This boomslang stuff is the kind of thing they experiment with in high-class laboratories . I had a talk with Winterspoon . Apparently , snake venom  --  cobra venom , to be exact  --  is sometimes used in medicine . It 's used in the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot being done in the way of scientific investigation into snake bite . " " Interesting and suggestive , " said Fournier thoughtfully . " Yes . But let 's get on . " The three men bent over the plan . " Here 's No. 16 , " said Japp . " And here 's No. 2 where Giselle was sitting , with a lot of people and seats intervening . If the girl did n't move from her seat  --  and everybody says she did n't  --  she could n't possibly have aimed the thorn to catch Giselle on the side of the neck . I think we can take it she 's pretty well out of it . " Now then , No. 12 , opposite . That 's the dentist , Norman Gale . Very much the same applies to him . Small fry . I suppose he 'd have a slightly better chance of getting snake venom . " " It is not an injection usually favored by dentists , " murmured Poirot gently . " It would be a case of kill rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his patients as it is , " said Japp , grinning . " Still , I suppose he might move in circles where you could get access to some funny business in drugs . He might have a scientific friend . But as regards possibility , he 's pretty well out of it . He did leave his seat , but only to go to the washroom  --  that 's in the opposite direction . On his way back to his seat he could n't be farther than the gangway here , and to shoot off a thorn from a blowpipe so as to catch the old lady in the neck , he 'd have to have a kind of pet thorn that would do tricks and make a right-angle turn . So he 's pretty well out of it . " " I agree , " said Fournier . " Let us proceed . " " We 'll cross the gangway now . No. 17 . " " That was my seat originally , " said Poirot . " I yielded it to one of the ladies , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the Honorable Venetia . Well , what about her ? She 's a big bug . She might have borrowed from Giselle . Does n't look as though she had any guilty secrets in her life , but perhaps she pulled a horse in a point to point , or whatever they call it . We 'll have to pay a little attention to her . The position 's possible . If Giselle had got her head turned a little , looking out of the window , the Honorable Venetia could take a sporting shot  --  or do you call it a sporting puff ? ? diagonally across down the car . It would be a bit of a fluke , though . I rather think she 'd have to stand up to do it . She 's the sort of woman who goes out with the guns in the autumn . I do n't know whether shooting with a gun is any help to you with a native blowp ipe . I suppose it 's a question of eye just the same . Eye and practice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been big-game hunting in odd parts of the globe . She might have got hold of some queer native stuff that way . What balderdash it all sounds , though ! It does n't make sense . " " It does indeed seem unlikely , " said Fournier . " Mademoiselle Kerr ? 1 saw her at the inquest today . " He shook his head . " One does not readily connect her with murder . " " Seat 13 , " said Japp . " Lady Horbury . She 's a bit of a dark horse . I know something about her I 'll tell you presently . I should n't be surprised if she had a guilty secret or two . " " I happen to know , " said Fournier , " that the lady in question has been losing very heavily at the baccarat table at Le Pinet . " " That 's smart of you . Yes , she 's the type to be mixed up with Giselle . " " I agree absolutely . " " Very well , then ; so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't leave her seat either , you remember . She 'd have had to kneel up in her seat and lean over the top  --  with eleven people looking at her . Oh , hell , let 's get on . " " Numbers 9 and 10 , " said Fournier , moving his finger on the plan . " M. Hercule Poirot and Doctor Bryant , " said Japp . " What has NI . Poirot to say for himself ? " Poirot shook his head sadly . " Mon estomac , " he said pathetically . " Alas , that the brain should be the servant of the stomach . " " I , too , " said Fournier with sympathy . " In the air , I do not feel well . " He closed his eyes and shook his head expressively . " Now then , Doctor Bryant . What about Doctor Bryant ? Big bug in Harley Street . Not very likely to go to a Frenchwoman moneylender , but you never know . And if any funny business crops up with a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my scientific theory comes in . A man like Bryant , at the top of the tree , is in with all the medical-research people . He could pinch a test tube of snake venom as easy as winking when he happens to be in some swell laboratory . " " They check these things , my friend , " objected Poirot . " It would not be just like plucking a buttercup in a meadow . " " Even if they do check ' em a clever man could substitute something harmless  --  it could be done . Simply because a man like Bryant would be above suspicion . " " There is much in what you say , " agreed Fournier . " The only thing is : Why did he draw attention to the thing ? Why not say the woman died from heart failure  --  natural death ? " Poirot coughed . The other two looked at him inquiringly . " I fancy , " he said , " that that was the doctor 's first  --  well , shall we say , impression ? After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a wasp sting . There was a wasp , remember . " " Not likely to forget that , " put in Japp . " You 're always harping on it . " " However , " continued Poirot , " I happened to notice the fatal thorn on the ground and picked it up . Once we had found that , everything pointed to murder . " " The thorn would be bound to be found anyway , " said Japp . Poirot shook his head . " There is just a chance that the murdered might have been able to pick it up unobserved . " " Bryant ? " " Bryant or another . " " Ii 'm , rather risky . " Fournier disagreed . " You think so now , " he said , " because you know that it is murder . But when a lady dies suddenly of heart failure , if a man is to drop his handkerchief and stoop to pick it up , who will notice the action or think twice about it ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy Bryant is definitely on the list of suspects . He could lean his head round the corner of his seat and do the blowpipe act -- again diagonally across the car . But why nobody saw him  --  However , I wo n't go into that again . Whoever did it was n't seen ! " " And for that , I fancy , there must be a reason , " said Fournier . " A reason that , by all I have heard " ? he smiled ? " will appeal to M. Poirot . I mean a psychological reason . " " Continue , my friend , " said Poirot . " It is interesting , what you say there . " " Supposing , " said Fournier , " that when traveling in a train you were to pass a house in flames . Everyone 's eyes would at once be drawn to the window . Everyone would have his attention fixed on a certain point . A man in such a moment might whip out a dagger and stab a man , and nobody would see him do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poirot . " I remember a case in which I was concerned  --  a case of poison where that very point arose . There was , as you call it , a psychological moment . If we discover that there was such a moment during the journey of the Prometheus ? " " We ought to find that out by questioning the stewards and the passengers , " said Japp . " True . But if there was such a psychological moment , it must follow logically that the cause of that moment must have originated with the murderer . He must have been able to produce the particular effect that caused that moment . " " Perfectly , perfectly , " said the Frenchman . " Well , we 'll note down that as a point for questions , " said Japp . " I 'm coming now to Seat No. 8 ? Daniel Michael Clancy . " Japp spoke the name with a certain amount of relish . " In my opinion , he 's the most likely suspect we 've got . What 's easier than for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get some unsuspecting scientific chemist to let him handle the stuff ? Do n't forget he went down past Giselle 's seat  --  the only one of the passengers who did . " " I assure you , my friend , " said Poirot , " that I have not forgotten that point . " He spoke with emphasis . Japp went on : " He could have used that blowpipe from fairly close quarters without any need of a psychological moment , as you call it . And he stood quite a respectable chance of getting away with it . Remember , he knows all about blowpipes ; he said so . " " Which makes one pause , perhaps . " " Sheer artfulness , " said Japp . " And as to this blowpipe he produced today  --  who is to say that it 's the one he bought two years ago ? The whole thing looks very fishy to me . I do n't think it 's healthy for a man to be always brooding over crime and detective stories . Reading up all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is certainly necessary for a writer to have ideas in his head , " agreed Poirot . Japp returned to his plan of the plane . " No. 4 was Ryder  --  the seat slap in front of the dead woman . Do n't think he did it . But we ca n't leave him out . He went to the washroom ; he could have taken a pot shot on the way back from fairly close quarters . The only thing is , he 'd be right up against the archaeologist fellows when he did so . They 'd notice it  --  could n't help it . " Poirot shook his head thoughtfully . " You are not , perhaps , acquainted with many archaeologists ? If these two were having a really absorbing discussion on some point at issue  --  eh bien , my friend , their concentration would be such that they would be quite blind and deaf to the outside world . They would be existing , you see , in 5000 or so B.C. Nineteen hundred and thirty-four A.D. would have been nonexistent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we 'll pass on to them . What can you tell us about the Duponts , Fournier ? " " M. Armand Dupont is one of the most distinguished archaeologists in France . " " Then that does n't get us anywhere much . Their position in the car is pretty good from my point of view  --  across the gangway , but slightly farther forward than Giselle . And I suppose that they 've knocked about the world and dug things up in a lot of queer places ; they might easily have got hold of some native snake poison . " " It is possible , yes , " said Fournier . " But you do n't believe that it 's likely ? " Fournier shook his head doubtfully . " M. Dupont lives for his profession . He is an enthusiast . He was formerly an antique dealer . He gave up a flourishing business to devote himself to excavation . Both he and his son are devoted heart and soul to their profession . It seems to me unlikely  --  I will not say impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will believe anything ! ? unlikely that they are mixed up in this business . " " All right , " said Japp . He picked up the sheet of paper on which he had been making notes and cleared his throat . " This is where we stand : Jane Grey . Probability , poor . Possibility , practically nil . Gale . Probability , poor . Possibility , again practically nil . Miss Kerr . Very improbable . Possibility , doubtful . Lady Horbury . Probability , good . Possibility , practically nil . M. Poirot , almost certainly the criminal ; the only man on board who could create a psychological moment for all concerned . " Inspector Japp enjoyed a good laugh over his little joke and Poirot smiled indulgently and Fournier a trifle diffidently . Then the detective resumed : " Bryant . Probability and possibility , both good . Clancy . Motive doubtful , probability and possibility very good indeed . Ryder . Probability uncertain , possibility quite fair . The two Duponts . Probability poor as regards motive , good as to means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty fair summary , I think , as far as we can go . We 'll have to do a lot of routine inquiry . I shall take on Clancy and Bryant first ; findout what they 've been up to ; if they 've been hard up at any time in the past ; if they 've seemed worried or upset lately ; their movements in the last year  --  all that sort of stuff . I 'll do the same for Ryder . Then it wo n't do to neglect the others entirely . get Wilson to nose round there . M. Fournier , here , will undertake the Duponts . " The man from the Siireth nodded . " Be well assured , that will be attended to . I shall return to Paris tonight . There may be something to be got out of Elise , Giselle 's maid , now that we know a little more about the case . Also , I will check up Giselle 's movements very carefully . It will be well to know where she has been during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once or twice . We may get information as to her contacts with some of the English people involved . Ah , yes , there is much to do . " They both looked at Poirot , who was absorbed in thought . " You going to take a hand at all , M. Poirot ? " asked Japp . Poirot roused himself . " Yes , I think I should like to accompany M. Fournier to Paris . " " Enchante , " said the Frenchman . " What are you up to , I wonder ? " said Japp . He looked at Poirot curiously . " You 've been very quiet over all this . Got some of your little ideasin your head , eh ? " " One or two  --  one or two  --  but it is very difficult . " " Let 's hear about it . " " One thing that worries me , " said Poirot slowly , " is the place where the blowpipe was found . " " Naturally ! It nearly got you locked up . " Poirot shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not because it was found pushed down beside my seat that it worries me  --  it was its being pushed down behind any seat . " " I do n't see anything in that , " said Japp . " Whoever did it had got to hide the thing somewhere . He could n't risk its being found on him . " " Euidemment . But you may have noticed , my friend , when you examined the plane , that although the windows can not be opened , there is in each of them a ventilator  --  a circle of small round holes in the glass which can be opened or closed by turning a fan of glass . These holes are of a sufficient circumference to admit of the passage of our blowpipe . What could be simpler than to get rid of the blowpipe that way ? It falls to the earth beneath and it is extremely unlikely that it will ever be found . " " I can think of an objection to that  --  the murderer was afraid of being seen . If he pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I see , " said Poirot . " He was not afraid of being seen placing the blowpipe to his lips and dispatching the fatal dart , but he was afraid of being seen trying to push the blowpipe through the window ! " " Sounds absurd , I admit , " said Japp , " but there it is . He did hide the blowpipe behind the cushion of a seat . We ca n't get away from that . " Poirot did not answer , and Fournier asked curiously : " It gives you an idea , that ? " Poirot bowed his head assentingly . " It gives rise to , say , a speculation in my mind . " With absentminded fingers he straightened the unused inkstand that Japp 's impatient hand had seta little askew . Then lifting his head sharply , he asked : " A propos , have you that detailed list of the belongings of the passengers that I asked you to get me ?

The white powder in that bottle was cocaine . " Poirot 's eyes opened a little . He nodded his head slowly . " Nothing much to do with our case , perhaps , " said Japp . " But you do n't need me to tell you that a woman who 's got the cocaine habit has n't got much moral restraint . I 've an idea , anyway , that her ladyship would n't stick at much to get what she wanted , in spite of all that helpless-feminine business . All the same , I doubt if she 'd have the nerve to carry a thing like this through . And frankly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . The whole thing is a bit of a teaser . " Poirot gathered up the loose typewritten sheets and read them through once again . Then he laid them down with a sigh . " On the face of it , " he said , " it seems to point very plainly to one person as having committed the crime . And yet , I can not see why , or even how . " Japp stared at him . " Are you pretending that by reading all this stuff you 've got an idea who did it ? " " I think so . " Japp seized the papers from him and read them through , handing each sheet over to Fournier when he had finished with it . Then he slapped them on the table and stared at Poirot . " Are you pulling my leg , moo-sior ? " " No , no . Quelle idee ! " The Frenchman in his turn laid down the sheets . " What about you , Fournier ? " The Frenchman shook his head . " I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see that this list advances us much . " " Not by itself , " said Poirot , " but taken in conjuncture with certain features of the case .. .. No ? Well , it may be that I am wrong  --  quite wrong . " " Well , come out with your theory , " said Japp . " I 'll be interested to hear it , at all events . " Poirot shook his head . " No , as you say , it is a theory  --  a theory only . I hoped to find a certain object on that list . Eh Bien , I have found it . It is there . But it seems to point in the wrong direction . The right clue on the wrong person . That means there is much work to be done , and truly , there is much that is still obscure to me . I can not see my way . Only , certain facts seem to stand out , to arrange themselves in a significant pattern . You do not find it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , then , each work to his own idea . I have no certainty , I tell you ; only a certain suspicion . " " I believe you 're just talking through your hat , " said Japp . He rose . " Well , let 's call it a day . I work the London end , you return to Paris , Fournier  --  and what about our M. Poirot ? " " I still wish to accompany M. Fournier to Paris  --  more than ever now . " " More than ever ? I 'd like to know just what kind of maggot you 've got in your brain . " " Maggot ? Ce n'est pas : toll , ca ! " Fournier shook hands ceremoniously . " I wish you good evening , with many thanks for your delightful hospitality . We will meet , then , at Croydon tomorrow morning ? " " Exactly . A demain . " " Let us hope , " said Fournier , " that nobody will murder us en route . " The two detectives departed . Poirot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose and cleared away any traces of disorder . He went to a side table and picked up a copy of the Sketch . He turned the pages until he came to the one he sought . " Two Sun Worshipers , " it was headed . " The Countess of Horbury and Mr. Raymond Barraclough at Le Pinet . " He looked at the two laughing figures in bathing suits , their arms entwined . " I wonder , " said Hercule Poirot . " One might do something along those lines . Yes , one might . "
