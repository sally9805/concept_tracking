The National Central is where it all began , the division that is venerated and exalted for its founding of the pro game and feared and admired for its traditional rock-'em-sock-'em , put-it-to-'em style of play . Old-fashioned crunch football . Inflate the ball and they 're ready . Straightforward men playing a brutally direct game . Chicago : George Halas and the Monsters of the Midway . Green Bay : Vince Lombardi and Title-town U.S.A. Detroit : the fierce Lions winning championships under Coach Buddy Parker and Quarterback Bobby Layne. // Those are the glories of the past . It is different now . Asked about his team 's basic strengths and weaknesses , a Chicago man says , " The Bears have no basic strengths . " Fans are restless , players frustrated , coaches suffer from rampant insecurities . At Green Bay , Dan Devine looks nervously over his shoulder at Bart Starr , the Packers ' old hero , waiting in the wings . Chicago 's Abe Gibron almost certainly will get the ax unless the Bears start to win . In Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' owner , Bill Ford , after the sudden death of Coach Don McCafferty . Forzano was Ford 's personal choice for the job , yet it 's likely to be a short romance . Everything is friendly , but there is no long-term contract . Produce immediate results , or else . // For these three coaches it is a fight for survival , and it 's an unfair fight . They are good men , first-rate professionals who deserve better , but the unsettled conditions in professional football this year make their jobs even more difficult . Unrest , strikes , name-calling , WFL raids , the logistics of dealing with unwieldy squads of 60 , 70 or 80 players . " I have n't had a quiet meal since the rookies reported on July 10th , " says Devine , trying to deal with crisis piled on crisis . // The one island of calm and accomplishment is in Minnesota , home of the Vikings , by decades the youngest member of the division . No siege atmosphere here . The Vikings stand alone . With two visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract tucked away in his pocket , Coach Bud Grant is untroubled . Not even a clutch of unsigned players and a powerful Players ' Association lobby can shake the Iceman 's glacial calm . // " The strike will leave no problems , " says Defensive Back Charlie West . " We 're people of the moment , and at this moment it 's all football . " The sentiment is reassuring , but of greater import is West 's return to health from knee surgery . The Vikes need this talented Kamikaze to run back kickoffs and to serve as swing man in the secondary . Minnesota could use better depth throughout the defense , since age is beginning to catch up with those stalwarts , particularly the famous front four . Yet the oldest , 36-year-old End Jim Marshall , never looked better , and the quartet seems ready to swing again . Indeed , the decline of the Viking defense is not so much a result of advancing age as it is of changes in the game . The defensive structure was designed primarily to combat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis in the NFL has veered toward the run . Minnesota 's opponents are doing just that , running by the awesome pass rush . And not only Larry Csonka ; less powerful runners are succeeding against Minnesota . The Vikings hope to correct this by altering priorities , with the line reading on the run and accepting greater responsibilities for its lanes . A very bright secondary plays its part smoothly , filling the holes and stopping the footrace with admirable efficiency . Middle Linebacker Jeff Siemon and Cornerback Bob Bryant are particularly impressive . // If the defense is less effective than it used to be , it is still good enough to win . And the offense is better than ever . At times Fran Tarkenton , the most controversial Georgia Peach since Ty Cobb , is simply astonishing . Last year the notorious scrambler practiced economy , running around and throwing less often but with greater purpose . The Vikes made the Super Bowl as Tarkenton completed 61.7% of his passes , while having only seven interceptions , fewest among starting NFL quarterbacks . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rookie Running Back Chuck Foreman was sensational , gaining 801 yards in his professional debut , and Wide Receiver John Gilliam proved a perfect target for Tarkenton 's tosses . Gilliam developed an uncanny knack for sensing the busted play and coming back upheld to rescue a pass . // Although Tarkenton dismisses the Super Bowl as a circus and a pageant " for the press , " he and the Vikings would like another go at the big game . Minnesota 's chances to visit New Orleans in January depend on Grant 's ability to infuse new blood into an old offensive line and find a receiver good enough to pair with the gifted Gilliam. // At Green Bay , Fuzzy Thurston , an alum from the Lombardi era , was commiserating with the new Packers on their foundering offense . " At the end , we had trouble with the sweep , " said the former left guard with refreshing candor , " and we never could make the screen work . " // " Damn , nothing 's changed , " replied a young Packer cynic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't light a 10-watt bulb . " A less passionate analysis of the situation might blame the quarterbacks instead of the system . Whatever the reason , a relentless diet of line smashes has stacked defenses against Green Bay . As a result , John Brockington and MacArthur Lane , a fine tandem of heavy-duty backs , often ran into as many as six defensive players jammed on the line , with grinning safeties perched at their backs . For want of enough passes , the good Tight End Rich McGeorge angrily classified himself as " the third tackle . " Meanwhile , Dan Devine vigorously , perhaps too vigorously , looked for the solution : the right quarterback . The heir apparent is Jerry Tagge but journeyman Jack Concannon 's savvy and mobility could win the job . Neither Tagge nor Concannon is a long-term answer , but the Packers will settle for short , instant relief . Too bad the game ca n't be played without quarterbacks  --  in that case , Green Bay could once again be selling tickets to the Super Bowl . // The lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . " I believe the defense was on the field too long and just wore out , " says Brockington . And the defensive picture was further clouded by a leg injury to blue-chip Cornerback Willie Buchanon . When it is healthy and not overburdened , the defense is Green Bay 's strength . It is the last team in pro football to use man-for-man pass coverage , and it is probably the only one that has talent enough to handle that demanding assignment . A strong linebacking corps has been bolstered by the acquisition of tall Ted Hendricks from Baltimore in what can be called a short-term lend-lease deal . " Next year , " says Hendricks , " I 'm off to Jacksonville and the WFL . " No matter , the Packers are borrowing time . For the future there is Rookie Steve Odom , a quick , tough little punt returner who lifts Devine 's depressed spirits every time he gets his hands on the ball . Under the new rules this promises to be the season of the long return , which gives Devine hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a team momentum and wins ball games , " he observes , " and we just might come up with more than our share of those important plays . " // In Chicago there does n't even seem to be hope , only grating complaints . Last year Running Back Joe Moore demanded to know why he was being trained for World War III . When dealt to the Bears from St. Louis , Center Wayne Mulligan moaned , " I asked to be traded , traded anywhere , but that did n't mean to the Bears . " Mulligan never reported to Chicago . This year Moore , Carl Garrett and Jim Harrison , the club 's best running backs , all asked to be traded . // Abe Gibron is trying his best to turn the Bears around . And trades arc helping , including one for Philadelphia Defensive End Rich Harris that rounded out a powerful rush line that has Dave Gallagher at the other end , and Wally Chambers and Jim Osborne at tackles . // Furthermore , Gibron has installed a classy passer at quarterback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight end named Jim Kelly , who will curl into the middle , bust the zone and , oh yes , catch the football . Still far from being contenders , the Bears are at least striving , and in Chicago that may be enough to muffle the jeers. // Detroit 's Rick Forzano is a ball-control disciple , the kind who believes in hanging tough , biting the bullet , and grinding it out . With a sloppy defense and the Lions ' penchant for trying the big play , Forzano 's Sundays will be long and grim . They will get even grimmer when Quarterback Bill Munson starts throwing deep to his wide receivers  --  they dropped the ball 36 times last year . The toughest ordeal may be the locker-room harangues by Owner Ford , which may weigh heavier than dropped passes , feckless tackling and all the rest . How 's your stomach , Rick ?
