Cleopatra got decked out in a rug , and Scarlett O'Hara , fresh out of frills , went to town in Tara 's velvet draperies . Contemporary women can now be almost as enterprising . They can pick from Designer Jenny Bell Whyte 's new collection of " Museum Pieces , " which gives proof that some of the best fashion around has for years been underfoot , on walls and over windows . <P> Not just any walls and windows , of course . Jenny Bell 's long skirts , coats and dresses are made from venerable fabrics . Most of them-18th century Russian Orthodox deacons ' vestments , Oriental silk wall hangings , early American quilts-were rescued from museum basements or bargained for at antique auctions . They were cleaned , reworked , cut and designed for contemporary use . <P> The idea for museum fashions occurred to Jenny Bell in January when she heard that the Brooklyn Museum was having a housecleaning and went to have a look . She returned home with a 56-year-old embroidered Egyptian silk scarf and an 81-year-old American patchwork quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet trimming for the quilt , two handsome evening skirts emerged . A few more finds and Jenny Bell had enough to sell to Saks Fifth Avenue . Mindful of her 13 successful years as a Seventh Avenue designer , Saks bought the lot at first sight . Displayed in the store 's windows last month , the first collection ( priced from $95 to $200 ) sold so well that Saks asked for more . <P> Wrinkles and Wisps . The new series of Museum Pieces , due for sale at Saks by the end of May , took even more scouring . One piece , an 1860 Chinese silk wall hanging from Boston 's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum , commemorates the 50th anniversary of a noble marriage ; the figures are complete with embroidered wrinkles and fine wisps of hair . Jenny Bell backed the hanging with two layers of silk and cut it into two skirts ( about $700 each ) . <P> The most prized finds were a group of ornately embroidered bishops ' robes made of brocade , suede and velvet , bought from the Lavrosky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put scissors to the material immediately , " Jenny Bell says , " when I was told they were consecrated . I called the Russian Orthodox Church to have them deconsecrated because I thought people might feel a little strange wearing them . " To play it safe with both God and woman , she has agreed to hand over her favorite piece , an 18th century black brocade deacon 's robe , to Manhattan 's Ukrainian Institute . Explains Jenny Bell : " I gave away my prize piece for absolution. "
