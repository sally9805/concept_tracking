THE PRESIDENCY <P> Some oldtimers say that it has n't been this way since World War II , when shadowy figures moved up and down the Washington avenues , when Presidents and Vice Presidents and generals and diplomats rolled up their collars and scurried off into the night for secret meetings , carrying confidential proposals . <P> Maybe the Bay of Pigs was another such time , or the Cuban missile crisis . But then all of these episodes dealt with the national security and military moves . <P> Now , instead , we have a political crisis that has produced something of the same mood , something of the same kind of clandestine ballet . Baltimore Prosecutor George Beall sneaks over to Washington to confer . Agnew has a late-afternoon meeting with Nixon . There is the offer of a deal by Agnew to his own Government 's Justice Department . Cox flits in and out of meetings with Wright &; Co . <P> If the White House had hired Madison Avenue counsel to devise a script to humiliate Agnew and raise rumors that he might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better . First , give a " No comment " to rumors of resignation . <P> Then take that back but refuse to express total confidence . Then go back to " No comment . " If it was not ineptitude , it was totally diabolical . <P> Up in Port Chester , N.Y. , old John Connally met with the Republican liberal fat cats out in Westchester , listening to Art Buchwald do a commentary on the King-Riggs tennis match . They too seemed to be waiting , licking their chops . <P> Hill committees have begun studies of how to deal with a vice-presidential vacancy and nomination . Former Agnew associates are roaring publicly against the White House . <P> For a moment it does n't seem like the United States of America , defender of the free world and strongest nation in the history of civilization . It becomes plain that Nixon ca n't go to Europe this fall as he wanted to . There are any number of reasons , but surely among them is the fact that his Government might come apart when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a weekly upheaval expected , anticipated and maybe even scheduled . <P> After a couple of weeks of renewed ceremonial prominence , it dawns on a lot of people that Richard Nixon is really not back to being President . Maybe he ca n't be . Maybe he is thinking and husbanding his energy for some new maneuver . But where is the President ? Where is a clear voice , a firm decision on anything ? Elliot Richardson is the steward of the big moral questions on Agnew and Watergate . Melvin Laird is promoting and pushing all the new contacts with the Congress , all the new laundry lists of legislation . And Henry Kissinger is the force in foreign policy , newly confirmed and already letting it be known he will go to work on the Arab-Israeli question . What we have now is not a presidency but a regency .
