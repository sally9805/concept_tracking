Located some 35 miles north of downtown Los Angeles at the edge of the Mojave Desert , Palmdale ( pop . 13,500 ) , Calif. , is a sleepy town where the loudest sounds are usually the whistling of desert winds and the popping noise of exhausts as teen-age dragsters race their cars . But Palmdale has been lifted , quite literally , out of obscurity . Scientists have recently discovered that it is in the center of a 120-mile-long , kidney-shaped area of land that rose as much as ten inches in the early 1960s . The phenomenon has earned the desert town a dubious notoriety . The Palmdale bulge , as the uplift is called , could be an early warning signal of a major-and potentially disastrous-earthquake . <P> Recent studies have shown that the ground rose noticeably before the 1971 San Fernando quake that killed 58 people in California 's last major trembler . Before a 1964 quake that destroyed much of Niigata , Japan , the ground lifted two inches , and the Chinese discovered an elevation of the land in Liaoning province before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Palmdale bulge has added to scientists ' concern . The swelling lies along a stretch of the 600-mile San Andreas Fault , a deep fracture that runs from below the Mexican border to about 100 miles north of San Francisco , where it meets the Pacific Ocean . The fault is actually the boundary of two tectonic plates , huge sections of the earth 's outer layer that are sliding in opposite directions . A western sliver of California , on the Pacific plate , is moving northwest . The remainder of the state is being carried by the North American plate toward the southeast . <P> Sticking Plates . As the two plates grind past each other , friction causes them to stick together briefly at some places . Then , driven by powerful and little-understood forces deep within the earth , they tear apart to resume their journeys , causing minor to moderate tremors . But in the Palmdale region , they have apparently been firmly locked for more than a century , while adjoining parts of the plate have slid as much as 30 ft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to catch up with the main bodies of the plates . Strains are inexorably building up in the crustal rock . When-as it must - the rock finally fractures , the plates will jolt ahead , causing a major earthquake . In fact , the last significant plate movement in the Palmdale vicinity occurred in 1857 , when a huge earthquake jolted the then sparsely populated area . <P> What scientists fear is that the Palmdale bulge could be caused by dilatency , a phenomenon that takes place in rocks before they break under stress . Tiny cracks open in the rock , increasing its volume ; this could account for the uplift of land . Dilatency has already been linked to such quake precursors as unexpected variations in velocities of seismic waves through the earth and changes in local magnetic fields as well as in electrical conductivity of rocks ; all have been used to make successful forecasts in the emerging science of earthquake prediction ( TIME cover , Sept. 1 ) .                @ @ @ @ @
