" My private jet is at the airport . I 'll go to Puerto Rico , or maybe I 'll just fly up to 40,000 feet and cruise around for the rest of the week . " Next to him as he talked and ate , kissing him on the cheek every now and again , was his wife , a slim girl with long brown hair and hazel eyes . She was wearing black pants , a black sweater and a rust-colored , fringed suede vest . Money Is n't Everything " Money has n't made me satisfied , " Mr. Brody went on .

I inherited on my 21st birthday . " The actual status and size of Mr. Brody 's inheritance , however is not clear . The bulk of Mr. Brody 's money apparently came to him on his 21st birthday last October in the form of an inheritance from his maternal grandfather , John F. Jelke , the oleomargarine manufacturer , who died in 1966 . Mr. Jelke 's will , filed for probate in Illinois , showed his total estate to be worth $6,881,000 . About half of this amount left in trust for several beneficiaries ; the amount of Mr. Brody 's share could not be learned . An official of the Continental Bank of Chicago , which has managed Mr. Brody 's trust , refused to say how much money Mr. Brody had , but called the estimates of $23-million to $25-million " gross exaggerations . " However much he may or may not have in the bank . Mr. Brody is short of cash .

A reporter gave him $5 so he could get his red 1969 Mercury Cougar convertible out of the garage for the 25-mile drive to the Westchester airport . Outside his office at 1650 Broadway a line of people was still waiting to seek his help . Speeding much of the time , and getting lost en route , Mr. Brody was in good spirits , laughing about the " joke I 've pulled on the world . " Once he turned to his wife and said , " You know I 'm for real , do n't you , lovey ? You know I can do all sorts of wonderful things . You know I can cure cancer and cure heroin addicts . You know that , do n't you ? " Mrs. Brody smiled and buried her head in her husband 's shoulder . Many of Mr. Brody 's remarks about himself throughout the weekend indicated a similar view of his role . At an impromptu news conference in his Puerto Rico hotel suite he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " people try to kill me by putting acid ( LSD ) in my coffee , but I will never die . " The round-trip flight was made in a sparkling white Falcon fanjet , with a ninepassenger seating capacity , that was waiting for the Brodys at the airport Saturday . Pan Am Makes Going Gratis Inside the plane was Jim Markel , a Pan American World Airways sales representative , who said that his company had agreed to provide the $1.5-million jet for a demonstration flight after Mr. Brody had made a $25,000 down payment on the aircraft by check on Friday . J. Henry Neale , an officer of the Scarsdale bank on which some of Mr. Brody 's checks have been drawn , said that as of Friday there were insufficient funds in his account to cover a $1,000 check . " Everyone should have his own Falcon jet , " Mr. Brody shouted again and again as the plane took off . He bounced up and down in his seat . " It 's the only way to fly , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes . " As the plane winged toward Puerto Rico at 550 miles an hour , the Brodys talked about themselves . Mr. Brody met his wife last Dec. 15 , when she went to his rented $80,000 house in Scarsdale with a friend . Mrs. Brody said that . she " came to Scarsdale to sell Michael and some of his friends some hashish .

At the airport , the group packed into two rented cars and drove to the Condado Beach Hotel , in San Juan , where the management gave them six $40- to $60-a-day rooms . The hotel manager , Marcel Wortman , said he had given the Brody party the rooms because " they explained to me they did n't want to spend money , they just wanted to give it away . ' Mr. Wortman added : " That guy Brody 's got a lot of funny ideas , but there 's something about him which makes you think he knows what he 's up to .

Mr. Brody seemed nervous , running his hands through his hair and repeatedly smacking the back of his neck . But Mr. Brody was still talking expansively about the future . He said that he would invite President Nixon to attend a news conference he planned to hold today at Kennedy International Airport . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Paris peace conference , " he said . " We 'll call up Brezhnev and ask him to come , too , and we 'll solve the world 's problems . " He looked at his wife and added : " When this is all over , we 'll go to Connecticut , buy a chicken farm and have babies . " The Falcon jet landed at the Westchester County Airport about 7:40 P.M. Mr. Brody and his wife immediately took off for the 60th Street heliport in Manhattan via helicopter . Mr. Brody was scheduled to appear on the television show about one hour after landing . In a television news show appearance later last night , Mr. Brody said that he had signed only seven checks , for a total of $48,000 , but that " within one year I should have made at least $100-billion . . .
