As the nation stumbles into a period of shortage and self-restraint , there are some who still insist the energy crisis is a hoax , notwithstand ? ing the oil embargo and the President 's urgent appeals to save fuel . The reason for the prevalent skepticism is not hard to find . Faced with the choice of admitting either that the Nixon administration blundered badly or that it fabricated a crisis , the doubters opt for conspiracy the ? ories , a la Watergate . Distrust of official pronouncements runs deep . And indeed , until a couple of months ago , the energy " crisis " did in ? clude much that was contrived . The present Arab embargo , however , is as real and unrelenting as the winter frost , and now , nearly two months after being hit with it , the government has begun to put into effect the first strong restrictions on the use of oil , gasoline and elec ? tricity , so that a relatively modest cutback in all imports will not wreck the economy and strangle some isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's program depends primarily on its novelty and on the willingness of people to believe there is a shortage and at accordingly . So-far it has been a crisis of statistics and proclamations only . The shortage wori't hit home until the first tanker returns from the Middle East with an empty hold , and that 's not expected until the middle of December . By the end of this year , the experts tell us , we should be feeling the pinch at slightly less than half-strength : they predict a shortfall in petroleum imports of about 1.4 million barrels a day . By midwinter the deficit could rise to 3.5 million barrels a day , creating an overall oil shortage of about 20 percent . These numbers are supplied by the government , but they are only guesses based on unverified statistics drawn up by the petroleum industry itself . This is one of the major follies of our current energy policy , one reason that oil conspiracies are widely suspected , and can not be proved or dis ? proved . There are no independent government figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come from the oil and gas industry . Even data on fuel that lies within the boundaries of federal property ( as described by James Ridgeway , TNR , August 18 &25,; 1973 ) , come from the drillers , pumpers and shippers who lease the land for profit . Figures on imported petroleum are considered more accurate be ? cause importers must buy a license and register each shipment with US Customs . Earlier this year an official of the Federal Trade Commission told a Senate subcommittee that in checking some statistics reported by the American Gas Association , he found that many companies had misreported their gas re ? serves , sometimes by as much as 200 percent . The companies that deal in natural gas are the same ones that we depend on for oil and oil data . Certainly one lesson to be drawn from the current crisis is that the government needs to pay closer attention to energy data , and as soon as possible ought to begin verifying the statistics furnished by corporations . Consider the care the government gives to bank audits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises to three or four million barrels a day , there is a dilemma that ought to be resolved immediately over the proper means of distributing cutbacks . Nixon 's economic advisers have told him , and he agrees , that it is vitally important that factories and large corporations be given the highest priority and the largest share of available energy . Unemployment , even without short ? ages , has been predicted to run as high as 6 percent next year ; factory shut-downs would drive it merci ? lessly higher . In the admixiistration 's scheme , the next in line after industry will be consumers , and last of all , commercial businesses . Thus on November 25 Nixon announced that he would order rationing of distillate fuel ( heating and similar oils ) through distributors , so that industrial users would get 10 percent less than last year , homeowners 15 percent less and commercial users 25 percent less . For months the President opposed any plan to allocate oil , and though Congress has urged him to move since summer , he did n't act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has been even more reluctant to interfere with gasoline , which is less crucial . Distillates are used to power trucks , buses , trains , electric power plants and home furnaces , while gasoline is used primarily in private cars . The distillate shortage has been a certainty since summer , but the President waited until last week to order US refiners to increase production . Because distillate and gasoline are refined from the same crude oil , in order to increase production of one , the other must be dimin ? ished . The effect of the new directive to refiners will be to further reduce gasoline supplies next year , Nixon says , to a level 10 percent below last year . The White House has n't decided yet how it will allocate reduced gas supplies , whether by direct coupon rationing , by price or tax increases or all three . Rationing by coupon is the most equitable way to control gasoline sales , but it would require the largest bureaucratic investment , and nobody wants it as a permanent arrangement . The White House is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , thus the need for policing , by permitting the sale of coupons for cash . Ideally , this would restrict total con ? sumption of fuel and at the same time allow people who want more gas to buy at a specified price from those who are willing to sell , coupons . In effect theblack market would be legalized ; the rich would ride and the poor , who need money more than coupons , would walk . The alternative to rationing is to raise prices . No one knows how high they would have to go before total consumption would taper off . If the government were to impose a heavy excise tax , perhaps raising the price of gas to one dollar a gallon , it would doubtless have a psychologically inhibiting effect on most consumers ( not the rich ) , but then some form of tax rebate would have to be enacted to avoid too great a shrinkage of buying power . William Nordhaus , a Yale economist who has studied the problem , thinks that withdraw ? ing so many billions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the economy , not to mention family budgets . The least attractive of all possibilities would be to allow the oil companies to raise gasoline prices , letting it go at that . The major refineries are sitting on some of the largest profits they 've made in years , and petro ? leum prices are still going up . Wholesale gas prices are up 38 percent since January , kerosene is up 58 percent and distillates are up 55 percent . The shortage will boost them further , unless the government puts a lid on . When the director of the White House energy policy office , John Love , was asked about oil profits last week , he said there was no plan to raise taxes or lower the depletion allowance . Energy companies , he explained , need large amounts of capital to keep them exploring . That may be true , but market incentives have risen sufficiently by now to assure maximum en ? terprise by drillers and producers . Exxon has earned profits of $1.6 billion so far this year ; it needs no fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any new tax credits . Rep. Les Aspin ( D , Wisc. ) is one of several congress ? men who are trying to increase oil corporation taxes , and as part of an amendment to the emergency energy bill in the house he has proposed that an " excess prof ? its tax " be levied on oil companies so ldng as the short ? age persists . Using a principle developed in the Ko ? rean war , he would tax excess profits above a defined base at the rate of 30 percent . Money collected this way would be used to promote research on new energy sources . Sen. Adlai , Stevenson III ( D , Ill. ) would deal with oil profits by setting up a Federal Oil and Gas Corporation to exploit energy on federal lands and set competitive standards for the entire industry . As the dimension of the gasoline shortage come into full view , it becomes clearer every day that rationing is the answer . Large increases in price or larger excise taxes will not assure that needed fuel will get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price they can pay : farmers , drivers of emergency vehicles and commuters who ca n't ride the bus . Yet the President delays , recall ? ing his OPA days and fretting about black markets , the unmanageability of rationirig bureaucracy , the resentment new controls will provoke . DECEMBER 8 , 1973 Labor Power From its newly enlarged headquarters in downtown Washington , several hundred yards from the White House , organized labor is working to put into office a " veto proof 94th Congress . " This means picking up 23 seats in the House , according to calculations of the AFL-CIO 's Committee on Political Education ( COPE ) , and seven seats in the Senate . But first Meany &; Co. is out to persuade the present House to pass a postal card voter registration bill . The measure already has passed the Senate ( where 99 sen ? ators turned out to vote , the only absentee being Sen. John Stennis , then hospitalized , which reflects the im ? portance attached to this legislation by the politicians themselves ) . The bill permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postcard and dropping it in the mail . Al Barkan , who directs COPE , already has visions of foremen passing out these cards on the assembly line . A poll taken by the Yankelovich research firm shows that about 75 percent of persons who did n't vote in 1972 would have gone to the polls if they had been registered ; it is an axiom among political ? cians that a heavy vote helps the Democrats . Many observers have long contended that registration bar ? riers are the main reason . for the low rate of political participation in the country . The proportion of eligible Americans who vote has dropped steadily since 1960 ; last year only 55 percent voted . Getting the House to approve postcard registration wo n't be easy , though the House Administration Committee okayed the legislation 15 to 10 . The AFL-CIO has already put about one million dollars into the campaign , . knowing the idea turns off politicians of both parties who come from " safe " districts where the political balance might be upset by a large influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote late in December or early during the second session of this Congress . And , the outlook is for approval , per ? haps by a slim margin . What Richard Nixon will do if the bill gets to his desk is problematical . If he vetoes it , Meany , Barkan and their lobbyists will fight hard to override . If they lose and they probably would , there 's always next year . Labor begins its 1974 political drives more united than in recent years . The scars of the 1972 presidential battle , which saw Meany neutral to the distress of a number of AFL-CIO unions , are healing , thanks mostly to Nixon , Watergate and the economy . To be sure a couple of unions ? notably the Communications Work ? ers and State , County and Municipal Workers headed by independent-minded Jerry Wurf , still are n't kick ? ing into COPE and are quietly holding their own private caucuses on ' 74 campaign strategy . But unions in New York , those in the garment trades and active for McGovern , have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the Yom Kippur war . Meany 's call for Nixon 's impeachment has helped him with the 7 more liberal federation units . COPE stands to have plenty of money to spend in 1974 and is likely to pour a lot of it into key Senate races . In the back rooms AFL-CIO thinkers consider only one Democrat in trouble in the Senate contests ? Mike Gravel of Alaska . COPE seems ready to help George McGovern in South Da ? kota , if he asks for it . And there 's early optimism that the Democrats can pick up Senate seats in Utah , Colo ? rado , Oklahoma , Kansas , North Dakota and Kentucky . On the Senate side 19 Democrats and 15 Republicans are up for reelection or ready for retirement . In the minds of some AFL-CIO officials , the recent mayoralty election in New York City and guberna ? torial election in New Jersey showed that unglamour ? ous and plodding Democrats can win , and collect the minority vote in the process , if they stick to the middle of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women 's lib and amnesty . There re ? mains within the Democratic Party , of course , a basic struggle between the hard-nosed practicals and idealisls , and in the struggle the AFL-CIO stands foresquare with the practicals . To the men and women around Meany the minimum wage and postcard voter registration issues are far more important than making sure youth , women and minorities are represented in fair share during party debate and conventions . Em ? ploying COPE 's one million dollar computer to recruit election workers and turning out the voters on election day is considered far more important than planning for the Democratic Party 's off-year miniconvention ( perhaps in December 1974 ) or pressing a candidate on how he or she feels about busing . As things stand today the main issues in ' 74 will be Nixon , the scandals that have come to be called Watergate and the economy ? and not necessarily in that order if business turns down as most economists are predicting . On paper the Democrats have a good chance of picking up congres ? sional power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim considerable credit and will soon thereafter begin eyeing 1976 . A visitor wander ? ing through Meany 's expanded and expansive marble-faced headquarters keeps hearing one name men ? tioned : Henry M. ( Scoop ) Jackson . But first there is ' 74 and even before that the postcard registration bill . At the AFL-CIO they take things one at a time .
