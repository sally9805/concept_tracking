And further lessons <P> <P> More than a month after the nation 's worst nuclear accident , at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor , the lessons and the consequences continued to be explored . Items : <P> &gt; Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr . backed away from his original estimate that the Harrisburg nightmare would cause no cancer deaths among the 2 million people living within a 50-mile radius of Three Mile Island . Appearing before Ohio Senator John Glenn 's nuclear proliferation and energy subcommittee , Califano predicted at least one death and acknowledged that some scientific investigators were estimating up to ten deaths . The revision was necessary because it turns out that the initial levels of radiation released in the accident were higher than thought at the time . <P> &gt; The Nuclear Regulatory Commission provided disturbing new details on the initial performance of Metropolitan Edison Co. , the plant 's beleaguered operator . Midway through the first critical day , the hot , uranium-filled core , normally bathed in pressurized cooling water , was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shut off the emergency core cooling system , probably because of ambiguous or misleading instrument readings . It was during this period that much of the damage was done to the fuel rods , causing a release of radiation . <P> On that day there was also a small fire or explosion of hydrogen gas , created when the reactor 's high temperatures disassociated the cooling water 's molecules . But the NRC team did not learn of it until two days later , the investigators disclosed , because of another snafu : harried by what one official called the " hassle factor , " controllers had apparently rolled up a crucial recorder sheet at the height of the accident , thereby inadvertently concealing key information . <P> &gt; The NRC admitted that it may have overestimated the seriousness of the large hydrogen bubble that formed in the reactor vessel . Despite that small explosion , investigators now believe there was never any danger of a bigger blast , which could have ruptured the reactor vessel and containment building , spreading deadly radiation . The false alarm was caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; NRC officials also said that radiation levels inside the containment building are now at least as high as 30,000 rems , enough to kill anyone who enters almost instantly , and possibly as high as 50,000 . The latter reading may be erroneous-possibly due to a " hot " particle on one device . By the NRC 's reckoning , almost all the core 's fuel elements are damaged , and even more radioactive material is exposed . New target date for entering the building : at least a year from now .
