txt Vo Van Duo , a 40-year-old farmer who was abducted with 19 others by the Vietcong last month , tells the story like a man who has memorized a nightmare . " I was sleeping and I grumbled when I was awakened , not knowing who it was , " he said , in Vietnamese . " I was afraid when I saw . It seemed certain I was being led outside to be killed . " His wife , he recalls , could not even speak out or cry out . She could only sit there , mute and wide-eyed as a soldier with a gun told her husband to shut up and keep moving . 20 Men Rounded Up It was June 19 at 3 A.M. in the hamlet of Apdon , in Trunglap village , which is reached by a long streak of dirt road just off Route 1 , South Vietnam 's major highway . The village , which is close to the district town of Cuchi , is about 28 miles northwest of Saigon . A platoon-sized group of armed Vietcong entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no sense of rush , searched the mudwalled little houses to round up 20 men in the People 's Self-Defense Force . This force consists of local , unpaid males who are too old for the army . They arc supposed to gather intelligence on Vietcong activities around the hamlet and give warning in case of attack . All Vietnamese of certain ages are required to belong , but only to guard their own hamlets . On June 17 in another hamlet called Gonoi , the Vietcong walked in , rounded up 21 men in the defense force , marched them out of the village lectured them and released them a few hours later . Mr. Duc knows that each time he is required to tell his story a Vietcong agent or sympathizer is probably present . " Some of them were in black pajamas , others in khalei uniforms had the accent of the North , " Mr. Due said . " They ordered all of us to bring our shirts with us , but not to wear them . We were half dead with fear . The Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where it was . It was raining and dark . " The men of Apdon were then blindfolded with their shirts and for an hour they listened to a speech warning them not to support the Government , the village officials or to take part in the People 's Self-Defense Force . " The Vietcong said to us , ' If we catch you a second time we 'll cut your throats . ' And , before they told us to return to the village , they took off our blindfolds and warned us not to look into their faces , " Mr. Duc said . " I did not dare do it . " Millions of Vietnamese have faced this dilemma in the last decade . They can not get out of serving in the defense force , but to stay in it often means death . " What can I do ? Tell me , " the farmer said . In the village , with its four hamlets , there are 11,000 people , many of them refugees . No South Vietnamese security . An energetic and courageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says that since the departure of American troops in the area , the Vietcong have come back , stronger and bolder than ever . The Americans were troops of the 25th Infantry Division . Its headquarters was at Cu= chi District in Haunghia . Province , long a Communist stronghold . Mr. Minh said that before the Cambodian operation in the spring of 1970 , a Vietcong company would have 10 or 15 men . Now they have 100 , he says . Every Vietcong unit is fortified with North Vietnamese troops , he added . The Communists enter the village from Binhduong Province , bordering to the northeast of Haunghia . Base Camp Nearby There is a regimental base camp of South Vietnamese soldiers in Trunglap village , but they take orders from the district , so the officials here can not ask them for help . There are two companies of Regional Forces  --  an armed , trained , paid militia  --  but their orders come from the district chief in CuchL There are two platoons of Popular Forces  --  also home guards who are paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ambush patrols . The Regional Forces come from the province . The . Popular Forces are recruited from the home village and are under the control of the village chief . Tired farmers such as Mr. Duc do not like being in the People Self-Defense Force , but to rebel would be to side with the Vietcong . The 15-year-olds in the defense force , waiting to be drafted , are thrilled to carry carbines .. They swagger like grown ' men , eager to fight , to prove themselves . But there is not much the village officials can do to ' give courage to Mr. Duc . He knows that if the Vietcong want to kill him , it will be easy to do . " Men like that , well , they have no choice but to stick to us , " Mr. Minh said . officials pretend that Trunglap is an ideal village . They admit that the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese are now coming in to terrorize the villagers .
