But opponents of the treaties still hope for a miracle <P> " Anyone who shifts against the Panama treaties now would look flabby back home , " observed Democratic Senator Alan Cranston of California . Added Majority Leader Robert Byrd : " Now that all the Senators have taken a stand , I believe that they 'll stay there . We might even pick up one or two votes . " <P> Thus , as Congress recessed last week for a ten-day vacation , Democratic leaders were confident that they had no chance of losing their 68-to-32 Senate majority in favor of the Panama Canal treaties . The first treaty , giving the U.S. the right to defend the canal 's neutrality after it is ceded to Panama , was ratified two weeks ago . The second treaty , turning over the canal to Panama by the year 2000 , will be voted on no later than April 26 , and perhaps as early as April 17 . <P> Even most Senators who opposed the treaties had little hope of staging a comeback . Said Michigan Republican Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where the votes would come from . A Senator ca n't afford to flip after his first vote . " <P> Nonetheless , opponents promised to continue fighting . Last week they offered four crippling amendments to the second treaty . Each was knocked down by overwhelming majorities , including an absurd proposal put forth by Wyoming Republican Malcolm Wallop . It called for return of the canal to the U.S. if either country violated the new treaties . New York Democrat Patrick Moynihan angrily called the idea " inane " and " devoid of intellectual content . " Said he : " We are reducing the Senate to a playground of juvenilia , a playpen of prepubescent youth . " After colleagues objected to the unusual personal attack , Moynihan apologized . <P> The incident underscored how frustrating-for both sides-the six-week-old debate has become . To end it , Byrd would prefer to move up the second treaty vote . But if he does , Kansas Republican Robert Dole has promised a filibuster that might prolong the debate for weeks . Worse yet , Massachusetts Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which passed by only one vote more than the required two-thirds majority , has threatened to switch if proponents try any strong-arm tactics . <P> This week treaty opponents , led by Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada , will step up pressure on reluctant supporters of the treaty . The possible wobblers include Brooke , Republican John Heinz of Pennsylvania and Democrats Dennis Deconcini of Arizona and Paul Hatfield of Montana . Laxalt argues that his job was made easier by the first vote . He explained : " Now we 're zeroing in on only a few people . " He has asked their constituents to write protest letters and sponsor antitreaty radio spots . Illinois Congressman Philip Crane , chairman of the American Conservative Union , warned that right-wing Republicans will campaign against the 15 G.O.P. Senators who voted for the first treaty if they support the second pact . Said he : " A candidate who has put himself out in front on support has written off significant constituencies . " Crane added , in a comment directed at Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker Jr. : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Republican Party to be supportive of these treaties . "
