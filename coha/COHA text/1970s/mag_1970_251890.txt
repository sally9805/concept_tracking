The party 's over . Now for that long drive back home to sleep it off . You weave your way to your 1975 Chevrolet , climb in , settle back and turn the ignition key . Five numbers light up in red on your dashboard-and quickly go out . What were they ? You try to repeat that sequence by quickly punching five numbered buttons in the proper order ; in your stupor , you are too slow-or you get one number wrong . Try again . A different sequence of numbers flashes on . Another miss . Better pull yourself together and concentrate . But you fail for the third time and you know that now the car wo n't start at all for another half-hour ; it has sensed that you are not sober enough to drive safely . <P> Science fiction ? Not according to Trevor O. Jones , automotive-safety products director for General Motors ' AC Electronics Division . He has developed and already built a prototype of a physiological tester that , installed in the dashboard , can judge a driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electronic device proves effective in tests this summer with volunteers from Marquette University School of Medicine , it may some day be standard safety equipment in U.S. automobiles . <P> Jones was inspired to invent his tester by highway statistics , which show that half of the drivers involved in fatal accidents have alcohol in their blood . But the device-which is designed to screen drunks by testing judgment , visual acuity , short-term memory and coordinated motor response-will also weed out drug users and those who are mentally or physically deficient . To satisfy the demanding gadget , a driver must be able to read the relatively small lighted numbers , memorize them , recall them , and punch them into the keyboard in a coordinated response within a few seconds . If he can perform these functions he is fit for the road . If he cannot-in three tries-the tester shuts off for a half-hour , giving him time to sober up before another attempt . <P> General Motors is aware that the public will not stampede to buy and install the testers , no matter how inexpensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will curb his own mobility ? " admits Jones . But if the device is perfected , there eventually could be legislation to require its installation in all cars . " That 's what happened with seat belts , " he notes . <P> Before any such laws are passed , Jones must build a few additional safeguards into his brainchild . How , for example , can the tester prevent an inebriated driver from cheating by calling on a friend or parking-lot attendant for help ?
