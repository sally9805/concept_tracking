Lights come up on a standard , dreary laundromat . There are tile floors , - washers , dryers , laundry baskets on wheels , and coin-op vending machines for soaps , soft drinks , and candy bars . There is a bulletin board on which various notices are posted . There is a table for folding clothes , a low table covered with dirty ashtrays and some ugly chairs littered with magazines . A clock on the wall reads three o'clock and should continue to run throughout the show . One side of the laundromat will be used as a window looking out onto the street . The song " Stand By Your Man " is playing over the radio . The door to the attendant 's room is slightly ajar . SHOOTER ( On the radio , over the final chords of the song . ) And that 's all for tonight , night owls . This is your Number One Night Owl saying it 's three o'clock , all right , and time to rock your daddy to dreams of de-light . And mama , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night owls gon na have to make it through the rest of this night by yourself or with the help of your friends , if you know what I mean . And you know what I mean . ( The radio station goes dead , music replaced by an irritating static . Alberta opens the door tentatively , looks around and walks in . She has dressed carefully and her laundry basket exhibits the same care . She checks the top of a washer for dust or water before putting her purse and basket down . She takes off her coat and hat . She walks back to the door marked Attendant , and is startled briefly when she looks in. ) p. 3 ALBERTA Hello ? ( Steps back , seeing that the attendant is asleep . ) Sleep ? Is that how you do your job ? Sleep ? What they pay you to do , sleep ? Listen , it 's fine with me . Better , in fact . I 'm glad , actually . ( She leans in and turns off the radio . She walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want him out here talking to you ? ( Procrastinating . ) You came to do your wash so do your wash . No , first ( She takes an index card out of her purse . She tacks it up on the bulletin board . We must see that it is very important to her . ) There . Good . ( She opens a washer lid and runs her fingers around the soap tray , taking out lint and depositing it in one of the coffee cans . As she does this , she accidentally knocks over her purse . ) It 's okay . Nothing breakable . Clean it up , that 's all . You 've been up this late before . Nothing the matter with you , just nervesand gravity . ( Alberta bends down and begins to put the things back in her purse . She can not see as Deedee backs in the door of the laundromat . Deedee is a wreck . She carries her clothes tied up in a man 's shirt . She trips over a wastebasket and falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DEEDEE Well , poo-rats ! ( Alberta stands up , startled , hesitates , then walks over to where Deedee is still sprawled on the floor. ) p. 4 ALBERTA Are you all right ? ( She is angry that Deedee is there at all , but polite nevertheless . ) DEEDEE ( Grudgingly . ) Cute , huh ? ALBERTA ( Moving the wastebasket out of the way . ) Probably a wet spot on the floor . ( Goes back to her wash . ) DEEDEE I already picked these clothes off the floor once tonight . ( No response from Alberta . ) We been in our apartment two years and Joe still ai n't found the closets . He thinks hangers are for when you lock your keys in your car . ( Still no response , though she is expecting one . ) I mean , he 's got this coat made of sheep 's fur or somethin ' and my mom came over one day and asked where did we get that fuzzy little rug . ( She is increasingly nervous . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they call it that . I said , " How often do you have to water a Ford plant ? " It was just a little joke , but he did n't think it was very funny . ALBERTA ( Her good manners requiring her to say something . ) They probably do have a sprinkler system . DEEDEE Shoulda saved my breath and just tripped over the coffee table . He 'd laughed at that . ( No response . ) Well , ( Brightly . ) I guess it 's just you and me. p. 5 ALBERTA Yes . ( Makes a move to get back to her wash . ) DEEDEE Guess not too many people suds their duds in the middle of the night . ALBERTA Suds their duds ? DEEDEE I do mine at Mom 's . ( She begins to put her clothes in two washers , imitating Alberta . ) I mean , I take our stuff over to Mom 's . She got matching Maytags . She buys giant-size Cheer and we sit around and watch the soaps till the clothes come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Well , more than that . She wrote it on a little card and sent it in to Cheer so they could use it on their TV ads . ALBERTA ( Pleasantly . ) Gives you a chance to talk , I guess . Visit . DEEDEE She says , " Just leave ' em , I 'll do ' em , " but that would n't be right , so I stay . Course she do n't ever say how she likes seeing me , but she holds back , you know . I mean , there 's stuff you do n't have to say when it 's family . ALBERTA Is she out of town tonight ? DEEDEE No , probably just asleep . ( Alberta nods . She reads from the top of the washer . ) Five cycle Turbomatic Deluxe .

DEEDEE We just dump all our stuff in together . ALBERTA That 's nice . DEEDEE Joe can fix just about anything . He 's real good with his hands . ( Relaxing some now . ) I 've been saying that since high school . ( Laughs . ) He makes trucks . God , I 'd hate to see the truck I 'd put together .

The end . ( Shrugs. ) p. 7 ALBERTA Overtime pays well , I imagine . DEEDEE It 's all-the-time , here lately . He says people are buyin ' more trucks ' cause farmers have to raise more cows ' cause we got a population explosion going on . Really crummy , you know ? People I do n't even know having babies means Joe ca n't come home at the right time . Do n't seem fair . ALBERTA Or true . DEEDEE Huh ? ALBERTA The population explosion is over . The birthrate is very stable now . DEEDEE Oh . ALBERTA Still , it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , we live right over there , on top of the Mexican restaurant .

He thinks blue is my favorite color . ALBERTA So the restaurant noise was bothering you . DEEDEE They got this bar that stays open till four . That 's how Joe picked the apartment . He hates to run out for beer late . He do n't mind running down . ( Broadly . ) Old Mexico Taco Tavern . Except Joe says it 's supposed to be Ol Mexico , like what they say in bullfights. p. 8 ALBERTA Bullfights are disgusting . DEEDEE You 've seen a real bullfight ? ALBERTA We used to travel quite a bit . DEEDEE ( Excited , curious , demanding . ) Well , tell me about it . ALBERTA There 's not much to tell . The bull comes out and they kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the washer . ) ALBERTA ( Pleased at the question . ) Fun . Does n't that sound like fun to you ? DEEDEE ( Encouraged . ) Your husband works nights too ? ALBERTA Herb is out of town . Did you mean to put that in there ? DEEDEE ( Peering into her washer . ) Huh ? ALBERTA Your whites will come out green . DEEDEE ( Retrieving the shirt . ) Joe would n't like that . No sir . Be like when Mom 's washer chewed this hole in his bowling shirt . Whoo-ee ! Was he hot . Kicked the chest of drawers , broke his toe . ( No response from Alberta . ) And the chest of drawers too . ( No response . ) Is Herb picky like that ? p. 9 ALBERTA Herb likes to look nice . ( Reaches for her soap . ) DEEDEE Hey ! You forgot one .

DEEDEE Sorry . ALBERTA That 's quite all right . ( Folding the shirt carefully , putting it back in the basket . Wants Deedee to vanish . ) DEEDEE One of those machines give soap ? ( Alberta points to the correct one and Deedee walks over to it. ) p. 10 DEEDEE It takes nickels . I only got quarters . ALBERTA The attendant will give you change . ( Pointing to the open attendant door , putting her own coins in her washers . ) DEEDEE ( Looking in the door . ) He 's asleep . ALBERTA Ah . DEEDEE Be terrible to wake him up just for some old nickels . Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a pocket full of money . Think it would wake him up if I stuck my hand in there ? ( Enjoys this idea . ) ALBERTA ( Feeling bad about not helping and also not wanting the attendant awake . ) Twenty years ago , maybe . ( Deedee laughs . ) Here , I found some . ( Deedee walks back , gives Alberta the quarters ; she counts out the change . ) ALBERTA That 's ten , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty . DEEDEE ( Putting the nickels in the soap machine . ) He should n't be sleeping like that . Somebody could come in here and rob him . You do n't think he 's dead or anything , do you ? I mean , I probably would n't know it if I saw somebody dead . p. 11 ALBERTA You 'd know . ( Starts her washers . ) DEEDEE ( Pushing in the coin trays , starting her washers . ) Okay . Cheer up ! ( Laughs . ) That 's what Mom always says , " Cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name is Deedee . Deedee Johnson . ALBERTA Nice to meet you . DEEDEE What 's yours ? ALBERTA Alberta . DEEDEE Alberta what ? ALBERTA ( Reluctantly . ) Alberta Johnson . DEEDEE Hey ! We might be related . I mean , Herb and Joe could be cousins or something . ALBERTA I do n't think so . DEEDEE Yeah . I guess there 's lots of Johnsons . ALBERTA ( Looking down at the magazine . ) Yes . DEEDEE I 'm botherin ' you , are n't I ? ( Alberta smiles . ) I 'd talk to somebody else , but there ai n't nobody else . ' Cept Sleepy back there . I talk in my sleep sometimes , but him , he looks like he 's lucky to be breathin ' in his . ( Awkward . ) Sleep , I mean . p. 12 ALBERTA Would you like a magazine ? DEEDEE No thanks . I brought a Dr. Pepper . ( Alberta is amazed . ) You can have it if you want . ALBERTA No thank you . DEEDEE Sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name them all . I could n't tell you seven presidents of the United States , but I can say the dwarfs . ( Very proud . ) Sleepy , Grumpy , Sneezy , Dopey , Doc , and Bashful . ( Suddenly very low . ) That 's only six . Who 's the other one ? ALBERTA ( Willing to help . ) You could name seven presidents . DEEDEE Oh no . ALBERTA Try it . DEEDEE Okay . ( Takes a big breath . ) There 's Carter , Nixon , Kennedy , Lincoln , Ben Franklin , George Washingtonuh ALBERTA Eleanor Roosevelt 's husband . DEEDEE Mr. Roosevelt . ALBERTA Mr. Roosevelt . That 's seven . Except Benjamin Franklin was never president . DEEDEE You 're a teacher or something , are n't you ? p. 13 ALBERTA I was . Say Mr. Roosevelt again . DEEDEE Mr. Roosevelt . ALBERTA There . Teddy makes seven . DEEDEE Around here ? ( Alberta looks puzzled . ) Or in the county schools ? ALBERTA Ohio . Columbus . DEEDEE Great ! ALBERTA Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I better be careful . No ain'ts or nuthin ' . ALBERTA You ca n't say anything I have n't heard before . DEEDEE Want me to try ? ALBERTA No . DEEDEE What does Herb do ? ALBERTA ( Too quickly . ) Is Deedee short for something ? Deirdre , Deborah ? DEEDEE No . Just Deedee . The guys in high school always kidded me about my name . ( Affecting a boy 's voice . ) Hey , Deedee , is Deedee your name or your bra size ? ALBERTA That was n't very nice of them . p. 14 DEEDEE That ai n't the worst . Wan na hear the worst ? ( Alberta does n't respond . ) Ricky Baker , Icky Ricky Baker and David Duvall said this one . They 'd come up to the locker bank , David 's locker was right next to mine and Ricky 'd say , " Hey , did you have a good time last night ? " And David would say , " Yes . In Deedee . " Then they 'd slap each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker moved . DEEDEE I guess , but see , the basketball players always came down that hall at the end of school . Going to practice , you know . ALBERTA One of the basketball players I taught ( Begins to chuckle . ) DEEDEE ( Anxious to laugh with her . ) Yeah ? ALBERTA thought Herbert Hoover invented the vacuum cleaner . ( Alberta waits for Deedee to laugh . When she does n't , Alberta steps back a few steps . Deedee is embarrassed . ) DEEDEE Why did you quitteaching . ALBERTA Age . DEEDEE You do n't look old enough to retire . ALBERTA Not my age . Theirs . p. 15 DEEDEE Mine , you mean . ALBERTA Actually , Mother was very sick then . DEEDEE Is she still alive ? ALBERTA No . DEEDEE I 'm sorry . ALBERTA It was a blessing , really . There was quite a lot of pain at the end . DEEDEE For her maybe , but what about you ? ALBERTA She was the one with the pain . DEEDEE Sounds like she was lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALBERTA I read her Wuthering Heights five times that year . I kept checking different ones out of the library , you know , Little Women , Pride and Prejudice , but each time she 'd say . " No , I think I 'd like to hear Wuthering Heights . " Just like she had n't heard it in fifty years . But each time , I 'd read the last page and look up , and she 'd say the same thing . DEEDEE What thing ? ALBERTA She 'd say , " I still do n't see it . They did n't have to have all that trouble . All they had to do was find Heathcliff someplace to go every day . The man just needed a job . ( Pause . ) But maybe I missed something . Read it again . " p. 16 DEEDEE My mom thinks Joe 's a bum . ( Somehow she thinks this is an appropriate response , and Alberta is jolted back to the present . ) DEEDEE No really , she kept paying this guy that worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " Deedee , he 's gon na be manager of that drugstore someday . " Hell , the only reason he worked there was getting a discount on this pimple cream . She thought that would get me off Joe . No way . We 've been married two years last month . Mom says this is the itch year . ALBERTA The itch year ? DEEDEE When guys get the itch , you know , to fool around with other women . Stayin ' out late , comin ' in with stories about goin ' drinkin ' with the boys or workin ' overtime orsomethin ' . Is that clock right ? ALBERTA I think so . DEEDEE Bet Herb never did that , huh ? ALBERTA Be unfaithful , you mean ? ( Deedee nods . ) No . DEEDEE How can you be so sure like that ? You keep him in the refrigerator ? ALBERTA Well , I suppose he could have ( Does n't believe this for a minute . ) DEEDEE Like right now , while he 's up in wherever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to say this . ) DEEDEE Akron , he could be sittin ' at the bar in some all-night bowling alley polishin ' some big blonde 's ball . ALBERTA No . DEEDEE That 's real nice to trust him like that . ALBERTA Are n't you afraid Joe will call you on his break and be worried about where you are ? DEEDEE You got any kids ? ALBERTA No . DEEDEE Did n't you want some ? ALBERTA Oh yes . DEEDEE Me too . Lots of ' em . But Joe says he 's not ready . Wants to be earning lots of money before we start our family . ALBERTA That 's why he works this double shift . DEEDEE Yeah . Only now he 's fixin ' up this ' 64 Chevy he bought to drag race . Then when the race money starts comin ' in , we can have them kids . He 's really lookin ' forward to that  --  winnin ' a big race and havin ' me and the kids run out on the track and him smilin ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us while the crowd is yellin ' and screamin ' ALBERTA So all his money goes into this car . p. 18 DEEDEE Hey . I love it too . Sundays we go to the garage and work on it . ( Gets a picture out of her wallet . ) That devil painted there on the door , that cost two hundred dollars ! ALBERTA You help him ? DEEDEE He says it 's a real big help just havin ' me there watchin ' . ALBERTA I never understood that , men wanting you to watch them do whatever it isI meanWell ( Deciding to tell this story , a surprise both to her and to us. ) every year at Thanksgiving , Herb would watch over me , washing the turkey , making the stuffing , stuffing the turkey . Made me nervous . DEEDEE You coulda told him to get lost . ( Offers fabric softener . ) Downy ? ( Alberta nods yes , accepting Deedee 's help , but is still nervous about it . ) ALBERTA Actually , the last ten years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing . He 'd come in and sit down saying " Mmm boy was this ever going to be the best turkey yet " and rubbing his hands together and I 'd push jars around in the cabinet and look all worried and say " Herb , I do n't think I have enough sage . " And he 'd say , " Well , Bertie , my girl , I 'll just go to the store and get some . " p. 19 DEEDEE ( Jittery when someone else is talking . ) I saw white pepper at the store last week . How do they do that ? ALBERTA I do n't know . DEEDEE Is Dr. Pepper made out of pepper ? ALBERTA I do n't know . DEEDEE And what did Herb do , that you had to watch , I mean . ALBERTA He gardened . I did n't have to watch him plant the seeds or weed the plants or spray for pests or pick okra . But when the day came to turn over the soil , that was the day . Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the garage . He 'd wipe it off and call in the kitchen window , " Alberta , it 's so pleasant out here in the sunshine . " And when he finished , he 'd bring out this little wooden sign and drive it into the ground . DEEDEE What 'd it say ? ALBERTA Herb Garden . ( Pauses . ) He thought that was funny . DEEDEE Did you laugh ? ALBERTA Every year . DEEDEE He 's not doing one anymore ? ( Walking to the window . ) ALBERTA No. p. 20 DEEDEE ( Looks uneasy , still staring out the window . ) Why not ? ALBERTA What 's out there ? DEEDEE Oh nothing . ALBERTA You looked like  --  DEEDEE Joe should be home soon . I turned out all the lights except the blueberries so I could tell if he comes in , you know , when he turns the lights on . ALBERTA When is the shift over ? DEEDEE ( Enforced cheer now . ) Oh , not for a long time yet . I just thoughtHe might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a beer . Course , he might stop off and bowl a few games first .

( Laughs a little . ) It better be cheap . DEEDEE ( Taking some notices down . ) Most of this stuff is over already . Hey ! Here 's one for Herb . " Gardening tools , never used . Rake , hoe , spade and towel . " p. 21 ALBERTA Trowel . DEEDEE ( Aggravated by the correction . ) You got great eyes , Alberta . ( Continues reading. ) " 459-4734 . A. Johnson . " You think this A. Johnson is related to us ? ( Laughs . ) No , that 's right , you said Herb was n't doing a garden anymore . No , I got it ! This A. Johnson is you . And the reason Herb ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rakes . But this says " never used . " Alberta , you should n't try to fool people like that . Washin ' up Herb 's hoe and selling it like it was new . Bad girl . ALBERTA Actually , that is me . I bought Herb some new tools for his birthday and then hegave it upgardening . DEEDEE Before his birthday ? ALBERTA What ? DEEDEE Did you have time to go buy him another present ? ALBERTA Yeswell , no . I mean , he told me before his birthday , but I did n't get a chance to get him anything else . DEEDEE He 's probably got everything anyhow . ALBERTA Just about . DEEDEE Did n't he get his feelings hurt ? ALBERTA No. p. 22 DEEDEE Joe never likes the stuff I give him . ALBERTA Oh , I 'm sure he does . He just does n't know how to tell you . DEEDEE No . He does n't . For our anniversary , I planned real far ahead for this one , I 'm tellin ' you . I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just my face real close up , to this place in Massachusetts , and they painted , well I do n't know if they really painted , but somehow or other they put my face on this doll . It was unbelievable how it really looked like me . ' Bout this tall ( Indicates about two feet. ) with overalls and a checked shirt . I thought it was real cute , and I wrote this card sayin ' " From one livin ' doll to another . Let 's keep playin ' house till the day we die . " ALBERTA And he did n't like it ? DEEDEE He laughed so hard he fell over backward out of the chair and cracked his head open on the radiator . We had to take him to the emergency room . ALBERTA I 'm sorry . DEEDEE We was sittin ' there waitin ' for him to get sewed up and this little kid comes in real sick and Joe he says to me , ( Getting a candy bar out of her purse and taking a big anxious bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see , I do n't know why , anyway Joe says to me " Deedee , that little girl is so much sicker than me . Let 's give her this doll to make her feel better . " And they were takin ' her right on in to the doctor ' cause she looked pretty bad , and Joe rushes up and puts this doll in her arms . p. 23 ALBERTA They let her keep it ? DEEDEE Her mother said , " Thanks a lot . " Real sweet like they did n't have much money to buy the kid dolls or something . It made Joe feel real good . ALBERTA But it was your present to him . It was your face on the doll . DEEDEE Yeah , ( Pause. ) but I figure it was his present as soon as I gave it to him , so if he wanted to give it away , that 's his business . But ( Stops. ) he did n't like it . I could tell . ( Walks to the window again . ) They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herb a fishing pole one year . DEEDEE ( Not interested . ) He fishes . ALBERTA No , but I thought he wanted to . He 'd cut out a picture of this husky man standing in water practically up to his waist , fishing . I thought he left it out so I 'd get the hint . DEEDEE But he did n't ? ALBERTA Oh , it was a hint all right . He wanted the hat . DEEDEE Right . ALBERTA ( Seeing that Deedee is really getting upset . ) Do you like the things Joe gives you ? p. 24 DEEDEE I 'd like it if he came home , that 's what I 'd like . ALBERTA He 'll be back soon . You 'll probably see those lights go on as soon as your clothes are dry . DEEDEE Sure . ALBERTA People just ca n't always be where we want them to be , when we want them to be there . DEEDEE Well , I do n't like it . ALBERTA You do n't have to like it . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't you like for Herb to be home right now ? ALBERTA I certainly would . DEEDEE ' Cause if they were both home where they should be , we would n't have to be here in this crappy laundromat washin ' fuckin ' shirts in the middle of the night ! ( Deedee kicks a dryer . Alberta is alarmed and disturbed at the use of the word " fuckin ' . " ) DEEDEE I 'm sorry . You probably do n't use language like that , well , neither do I , very often , but I 'm ( Now doing it on purpose. ) pissed as hell at that sunuvabitch . ( Alberta picks up a magazine , trying to withdraw completely . She is offended , but does n't want to appear self-righteous . Now , Shooter pushes open the front door .

SHOOTER You come on over , I 'll show you just how it 's done . DEEDEE Pool . SHOOTER Sure . ( Smiles , then turns sharply and walks back to Alberta , depositing an empty soap box in the trash can . ) Willie always keeps hot water . You could have a nice cup of tea . ALBERTA ( A pointed look at Deedee . ) No . DEEDEE Our wash is almost done . We have to  --  SHOOTER We 'll be there quite a while . Gets lonesome this late , you know . DEEDEE We know . ( And suddenly , everybody feels quite uncomfortable . ) SHOOTER ( To Alberta . ) It was nice meeting you . Hope I did n't interrupt your reading or anything . DEEDEE She used to be a teacher . SHOOTER That 's what you said . ( Walking toward the door . ) Right next door , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give you a piece of that fudge cake . DEEDEE Yeah , I 'll bet you would . p. 31 SHOOTER ( Closing the door . ) Big piece . ( Alberta watches Deedee watch to see which direction Shooter takes . ) DEEDEE ( After a moment . ) I thought we 'd had it there for a minute , did n't you ? ( Visibly cheered . ) Coulda been a murderer , or a robber or a rapist , just as easy ! ( Increasingly excited . ) We coulda been hostages by now ! ALBERTA To have hostages you have to commit a hijacking . You do not hijack a laundromat . DEEDEE Depends how bad you need clean clothes . ALBERTA I did n't like the things he said to you . DEEDEE He was just playin ' . ALBERTA He was not playing . DEEDEE Well , what does it hurt ? Just words . ALBERTA Not those words . DEEDEE You do n't miss a thing , do you ? ALBERTA I 'm not deaf . DEEDEE Just prejudiced . ALBERTA That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in here , - you 'd still be talkin ' to him , I bet . Seein ' if he knows your " old " favorites. p. 32 ALBERTA If you do n't want to know what I think , you can stop talking to me . DEEDEE What you think is what 's wrong with the world . People do n't trust each other just because they 're some other color from them . ALBERTA And who was it who said he could be a murderer ? That was you , Deedee . Would you have said that if he 'd been white ? DEEDEE It just makes you sick , does n't it . The thought of me and Shooter over there after you go home . ALBERTA It 's not my business . DEEDEE That 's for sure . ( Alberta goes back to reading her magazine . Deedee wanders around . ) DEEDEE You do n't listen to him on the radio , but I do . And you know what he says after " rock your daddy to dreams of de-light " ? He says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , if he has a " mama " to go home to , what 's he doing washing his own clothes ? So he do n't have a " mama , " and that means lonely . And he 's loaded , too . So if he 's got a wife , she 's got a washer , so do n't say maybe they do n't have a washer . Lonely . ALBERTA All right . He 's a nice young man who washes his own clothes and is " friendly " without regard to race , creed , or national origin . p. 33 DEEDEE I mean , we 're both in here in the middle of the night and it do n't mean we 're on the make , does it ? ALBERTA It 's perfectly respectable . DEEDEE You always do this when Herb is out of town ? ALBERTA No . DEEDEE You do n't even live in this neighborhood , do you ? ALBERTA No . DEEDEE Know how I knew that ? That garden . There ai n't a garden for miles around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEEDEE ( Knows Alberta was insulting her . ) So why did you come over here ? ALBERTA ( Knows she made a mistake . ) I came for the same reason you did . To do my wash . DEEDEE In the middle of the night ? Hah . It 's a big mystery , is n't it ? And you do n't want to tell me . Is some man meetin ' you here ? Yeah , and you ca n't have your meetin ' out where you live ' cause your friends might see you and give the word to old Herb when he gets back . ALBERTA No . ( Pauses . ) I 'm sorry I said what I did . Go on over to the pool hall . I 'll put your clothes in the dryer . p. 34 DEEDEE ( Easily thrown off the track . ) And let him think I 'm all hot for him . No sir . Besides , Joe might come home . ALBERTA That 's right . DEEDEE Might just serve him right , though . Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Willie and Shooter . Joe hates black people . He says even when they 're dancin ' or playin ' ball , they 're thinkin ' about killin ' . Yeah , that would teach him to run out on me . A little dose of his own medicine . Watch him gag on it . ALBERTA So he has run out on you . DEEDEE He 's workin ' the double shift . ALBERTA That 's what you said . DEEDEE And you do n't believe me . You think he just did n't come home , is that it ? You think I was over there waitin ' and waitin ' in my new nightgown and when the late show went off I turned on the radio and ate a whole pint of chocolate ice cream , and when the radio went off I could n't stand it anymore so I grabbed up all these clothes , dirty or not , and got outta there so he would n't come in and find me cryin ' . Well , ( Firmly . ) I was n't cryin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't cried in forty years . p. 35 DEEDEE Just happy I guess . ALBERTA ( With a real desire to help now . ) I had an Aunt Dora , who had a rabbit , Puffer , who died . I cried then . I cried for weeks . DEEDEE And it was n't even your rabbit . ALBERTA I loved Aunt Dora and she loved that rabbit : I 'd go to visit and she 'd tell me what Puffer had done that day . She claimed he told her stories , Goldilocks and the Three Hares , The Rabbit Who Ate New York . Then we 'd go outside and drink lemonade while Puffer are lettuce . She grew lettuce just for him . A whole backyard of it . DEEDEE Little cracked , huh ? ALBERTA I helped her bury him . Tears were streaming down my face . " Bertie , " she said , " stop crying . He did n't mean to go and leave us all alone and he 'd feel bad if he knew he made us so miserable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter and quieter till finally she was n't talking at all and Mother put her in a nursing home . DEEDEE Where she died . ALBERTA Yes . DEEDEE Hey ! Our wash is done . ( Alberta seems not to hear her . ) Look , I 'll do it . You go sit . ALBERTA ( Disoriented . ) No , I p. 36 DEEDEE Let me , really . I know this part . Mom says you ca n't blow this part , so I do it . She still checks , though , finds some reason to go downstairs and check the heat I set . I do n't mind , really . Ca n't be too careful . ( Deedee unloads the washers and carries the clothes to the dryers . Alberta walks to the window , seeming very far away . ) DEEDEE ( Setting the heat . ) Regular for you guys , warm for permos and undies . Now Herb 's shirts and shorts get hot . Pants and socks get ALBERTA Warm . DEEDEE What 's Herb got left to wear anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how positive Alberta is about this . ) What color tie ? ALBERTA Red with a silver stripe through it . DEEDEE ( Still merry . ) Shirt ? ALBERTA White . DEEDEE Shoes ? ALBERTA ( Quiet astonishment . ) I do n't know . DEEDEE Well I 'm glad . Thought you were seeing him all the way to Akron , X-ray eyes or something weird . Alberta p. 37 ALBERTA Yes ? ( Worried , turning around to face her now , afraid Deedee will know her secret . ) DEEDEE You got any dimes ? ALBERTA ( Relieved . ) Sure . ( Walks to her purse . ) How many do we need ? DEEDEE Two each , I guess . Four dryers makes eight . ( As Alberta is getting them out of her wallet . ) DEEDEE I do n't know what I 'd have done if you had n't been here . I did n't thinkbefore I ALBERTA You 'd have done just fine . Do n't forget Sleepy back there . DEEDEE I wish Mom were more like you . ALBERTA Stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALBERTA Thank you , but DEEDEE No , really . You 've been to Mexico and you 've got a good man . ( Alberta takes off her glasses , still very upset . ) DEEDEE Mom 's just got me and gaint-size Cheer . And she do n't say two words while I 'm there . Ever . I do n't blame her I guess . p. 38 ALBERTA Well DEEDEE Yeah . ALBERTA ( Back in balance now . ) But you 're young and pretty . You have a wonderful sense of humor . DEEDEE Uh-huh . ALBERTA And you 'll have those children someday . DEEDEE Yeah , I know . ( Gloomily . ) I have my whole life in front of me . ALBERTA You could get a job . DEEDEE Oh , I got one . This company in New Jersey , they send me envelopes and letters and lists of names and I write on the names and addresses and Dear Mr. Wilson or whatever at the top of the letter . I do have nice handwriting . ALBERTA I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take a fat orange crayon and scribble ( Making letters in the air . ) EAT BEANS , FATSO , and then draw funny faces all over the letter . ALBERTA I 'm sure the extra money comes in handy . DEEDEE Well , Joe do n't know I do it . I hide all the stuff before he comes home . And I keep the money at Mom 's . She borrows from it sometimes . She says that makes us even for the water for the washing machine . See , I ca n't spend it or Joe will know I got it . p. 39 ALBERTA He does n't want you to work . DEEDEE ( Imitating Joe 's voice . ) I 'm the head of this house . ALBERTA He expects you to sit around all day ? DEEDEE I guess . ( With good-humored rage . ) Oh , I can wash the floor if I want . ALBERTA You should tell him how you feel . DEEDEE He 'd leave me . ALBERTA Maybe . DEEDEE ( After a moment . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you give him the chance to understand  --  DEEDEE But what would I say ? ALBERTA You 'd figure something out . I 'm sure . DEEDEE I do n't want to start it . I do n't want to say I want a real job , ' cause then I 'll say the reason I want a real job is I got ta have something to think about besides when are you coming home and how long is it gon na be before you do n't come home at all . And he 'll say what do you mean do n't come home at all and I 'll have to tell him I know what you 're doing , I know you 're lying to me and going out on me and he 'll say what are you gon na do about it . You want a divorce ? And I do n't want him to say that . p. 40 ALBERTA Nowyou do n't know  --  DEEDEE ( Firmly . ) I called the bowling alley and asked for him and the bartender said , " This Patsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope he falls in the sewer . ALBERTA Deedee ! DEEDEE I hope he gets his shirt caught in his zipper . I hope he wore socks with holes in ' em . I hope his Right Guard gives out . I hope his baseball cap falls in the toilet . I hope she kills him . ( Pushing one of the carts , hard . ) ALBERTA Deedee ! DEEDEE I do . Last night , I thought I 'd surprise him and maybe we 'd bowl a few games ? Well , I was gettin ' my shoes and I saw them down at lane twelve , laughin ' and all . He had one of his hands rubbing her hair and the other one rubbing his bowling ball . Boy did I get out of there quick . I 've seen her there before . She teaches at the Weight Control upstairs , so she 's probably not very strong but maybe she could poison him or something . She wears those pink leotards and even her hair looks thin . I hate him . ALBERTA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean and stupid . I thought he 'd get over it , but he did n't . Mean and stupid . And I ai n't all that smart , so if I know he 's dumb , he must really be dumb . I used to think he just acted mean and stupid . Now , I know he really is p. 41 ALBERTA mean and stupid . DEEDEE Why am I telling you this ? You do n't know nuthin ' about bein ' dumped . ALBERTA At least you have some money saved . DEEDEE For what ? ALBERTA And your mother would let you stay with her till you got your own place . DEEDEE She 's the last person I 'm tellin ' . ALBERTA I 'll bet you 'd like being a telephone operator . DEEDEE But how 's he gon na eat ? The only time he ever even fried an egg , he flipped it over and it landed in the sink . It was the last egg , so he grabbed it up and ate it in one bite . ALBERTA One bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Picks me up , swings me around in the air ALBERTA ( Incredulous . ) He stuffed a whole egg in his mouth ? DEEDEE You 're worse than Mom . ( Angrily . ) He 's gon na be a famous race car driver someday and I want to be there . ALBERTA To have him pour beer all over you . DEEDEE Yes , to have him pour beer all over me. p. 42 ALBERTA ( Checking the clothes in one of her dryers , knowing she has said too much . ) He could have come in without turning on the lights . If you want to go check , I 'll watch your things here . DEEDEE You want to get rid of me , do n't you ? ALBERTA I do not want to get rid of you . DEEDEE So why do n't you go home ? Go get the Woolite for that yucky shirt you did n't wash . You not only do n't want to talk to me , you did n't even want me to touch that shirt . Herb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I may be a slob , but I 'm clean . ALBERTA I did n't want to wash it . DEEDEE That ai n't it at all . Herb is so wonderful . You love him so much . You wash his clothes just the right way . I could never drop his shirt in the washer the way you do it . The stain might not come out and he might say what did you do to my shirt and you might fight and that would mess up your little dream world where everything is always sweet and nobody ever gets mad and you just go around gardening and giving each other little pecky kisses all the time . Well , you 're either kidding yourself or lying to me . Nobody is so wonderful that somebody esle ca n't touch their shirt . You act like he 's a saint . Like he 's dead and now you worship the shirts he were . p. 43 ALBERTA What do I have to do to get you to leave me alone ? DEEDEE ( Feeling very bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . DEEDEE I 'm so stupid . ALBERTA You DEEDEE What ? Tell me . Say something horrible . ALBERTA ( Slowly , but not mean . ) You just do n't know when to shut up . DEEDEE Worse than that . I do n't know how . ( Hates what she has done . ) ALBERTA But you are not dumb , child . And do n't let anybody tell you you are , okay ? ( Takes off her glasses and rubs her eyes . ) DEEDEE I 'm sorry , Mrs. Johnson , I really am sorry . You probably been plannin ' this night for a long time . Washin ' his things . And I barged in and spoiled it all . ALBERTA I 've been avoiding it for a long time . ( Deedee feels terrible , she wants to ask questions , but is trying very hard , for once , to control her mouth . ) ALBERTA Herb died last winter , the day before his birthday . p. 44 DEEDEE When you got him the rakes . ALBERTA He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . I was making his cake . So I asked him to take out the garbage . He said , " Ca n't we wait till it 's old enough to walk ? " DEEDEE How ALBERTA I did n't miss him till I put the cake in the oven . Guess I thought he was checking his seedbeds in the garage . I yelled out , " Herb , do you want butter cream or chocolate ? " And then I saw him . Lying in the alley , covered in my cabbage soup . It was his heart . DEEDEE Did you call the ALBERTA I picked up his head in my hand and held it while I cleaned up as much of the stuff as I could . A tuna can , coffee grounds , eggshells DEEDEE ( Carefully . ) You knew he was dead , not just knocked out ? ALBERTA He 'd hit his head when he fell . He was bleeding in my hand . I knew I should get up , but the blood was still so warm . DEEDEE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alone , that 's not what I meant before . DEEDEE Looks like I 'm alone anyway . p. 45 ALBERTA That 's what I meant . DEEDEE Sometimes I bring in a little stand-up mirror to the coffee table while I 'm watching TV . It 's my face over there when I look , but it 's a face just the same . ALBERTA Being alone is n't so awful . I mean , it 's awful , but it 's not that awful . There are hard things . ( The dryers stop . Deedee watches Alberta take a load of clothes from the dryer , holding them up to smell them . ) DEEDEE I 'd probably eat pork and beans for weeks . ALBERTA ( Her back to Deedee . ) I found our beachball when I cleaned out the basement . I ca n't let the air out of it . It 's ( Turning around now. ) his breath in there . ( Sees Deedee is upset . ) Get your clothes out . They 'll wrinkle . That 's amazing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling you what Herb had on ? Gray suit DEEDEE white shirt , red tie with a silver stripe through it ALBERTA I hang onto the shirt he died in , and I do n't even know if he 's got shoes on in his coffin . p. 46 DEEDEE Well , if he 's flyin ' around heaven , he probably do n't need ' em . ( Pauses . ) You bought him all black socks . ALBERTA It was his idea . He thought they 'd be easier to match if they were all the same color . DEEDEE Is it ? ALBERTA No . Now I have to match by length . They may be all black , but they do n't all shrink the same . I guess I do n't really have to match them now , though , do I ? ( Continues to match them . ) DEEDEE I 'd like to lose all Joe 's white ones . ( Holding them up over the trash can , then thinking maybe it 's not such a good idea . ) ALBERTA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the window . ) Deedeeyour lights are on . In your apartment . All the lights are on now . DEEDEE You sure ? ALBERTA Come see . ( Deedee walks over to the window . ) DEEDEE You 're right . ALBERTA Yes . DEEDEE So what do I do now ? ALBERTA I do n't know . p. 47 DEEDEE Should I rush right home ? Ask Joe did he have a good time bowling a few games after his double shift ? Listen to him brag about his score ? His score he did n't make in the games he did n't bowl after the double shift he did n't work ? Well I do n't feel like it . I 'm going next door . Play some pool . Make him miss me . ALBERTA You should go home before you forget how mad you are . You do n't have to put up with what he 's doing . You can if you want to , if you think you ca n't make it without him , but you do n't have to . DEEDEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't stop going out on me , I 'm not ever speaking to you again ? That 's exactly what he wants . ALBERTA What you say is n't that important . But there is something you have to remember while you say it . DEEDEE Which is ? ALBERTA Your own face in the mirror is better company than a man who would eat a whole fried egg in one bite . ( Deedee laughs . ) ALBERTA But it wo n't be easy . DEEDEE ( Cautiously . ) Are you gon na wash that other shirt ever ? ALBERTA The cabbage-soup shirt ? No , I do n't think so . p. 48 DEEDEE Yeah . ALBERTA ( Loading up her basket . ) Maybe , in a few months or next year sometime , I 'll be able to give these away . They 're nice things . DEEDEE People do need them . Hey ! ( Leaving her laundry and going to the bulletin board . ) I told you there ai n't a garden for miles around here . You better hang onto these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the soil , is n't it ? ALBERTA Another two weeks or so , yes it is . Well . ( Taking the card. ) that 's everything . I 'll just get my soap and DEEDEE ( Hesitantly . ) Mrs. Johnson ? ALBERTA Alberta . DEEDEE Alberta . ALBERTA Yes ? DEEDEE I 'm really lonely . ALBERTA I know . DEEDEE How can you stand it ? ALBERTA I ca n't . ( Pauses . ) But I have to , just the same . DEEDEE How do Ihow do you do that ? ALBERTA I do n't know . You call me if you think of something . ( Gives her a small kiss on the forehead. ) p. 49 DEEDEE I do n't have your number . ALBERTA ( Backing away toward the door . ) I really wanted to be alone tonight . DEEDEE I know . ALBERTA I 'm glad you talked me out of it . DEEDEE Boy , you can count on me for that . Hey ! Do n't go yet . I owe you some money . ALBERTA No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then . DEEDEE ( Trying to reach across the space to her . ) Thank you . ALBERTA Now , I suggest you go wake up Sleepy back there and see if there 's something he needs to talk about . DEEDEE Tell you the truth , I 'm ready for a little peace and quiet . ALBERTA Good night . ( Leaves . ) DEEDEE ( Reaching for the Dr. Pepper she put on the washer early on . ) Yeah , peace and quiet . ( Pops the top on the Dr. Pepper . ) Too bad it do n't come in cans . ( Lights go down as she stands there looking out the window. ) @x The pool hall is small and seedy . Plastic beer ads cover the walls . Talc is kept in empty candy-bar boxes along the window sills . There is an old bar with sacks of potato chips and other snacks . Tacky ashtrays and calendars litter the room . There is one television set and one pool table . " The Star-Spangled Banner " is playing on the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar . As the song ends , he turns off the TV-and opens a beer . He pulls out a racing form and sits down . He looks at the clock . Shooter enters , carrying a sack of tacos , his cue case , and a beer . SHOOTER ( In greeting . ) Willie . WILLIE ( Not looking up from the form . ) It 's the man from the radio . SHOOTER How 's it goin ? WILLIE Gets any busier I 'll have to stand up . SHOOTER Or at least look up . WILLIE ( Looking up now . ) Sondra just called . SHOOTER She knows when I get off . WILLIE She sure does . SHOOTER Where else would I be ? p. 51 WILLIE Somethin ' like that . SHOOTER Somebody did one helluva job teaching that girl to tell the time . Tells me the time to come home , tells me the time to eat , tells me the time to go to bed . WILLIE Well , I told her I 'd send you on soon 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Got any winners tomorrow ? WILLIE Till tomorrow , they 're all winners . SHOOTER Still betting those grays ? WILLIE Yeah , the older I get , the more I love them gray horses . SHOOTER Trouble is , most of the ones you pick , gray is n't so much their color as an indication of their age . WILLIE Yeah , that one horse , Dusty Days , he 's still runnin ' from the first time I bet on him . ( Laughs . ) ' Bout eight years now . I sit here and handicap ' em , he always comes out the winner . I ca n't figure it out . SHOOTER It 's some other dude does the handicappin ' , Willie . Back in the stable . Finds out which ones you 're layin ' your money on , then ties lead weights to their legs . That 's handicappin ' , man . WILLIE You 're tellin ' me. p. 52 SHOOTER George go home already ? WILLIE Sick . SHOOTER Bad ? WILLIE You know any that 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his circulation with that wheelchair I gave him . WILLIE Callin ' himself the stick-shift cripple . That was nice , boy . End of the world would n't keep ol ' George from comin ' in here every night , but he sure does like havin ' that motor do the work . Last six months , he gets real tired , real quick . SHOOTER Sondra said he would n't even know it was real leather , but I figured , what the hell , it 's only money . WILLIE Oh he knew . Said , " Willie , cows got it rough , do n't they ? Folks lookin ' at ' em seein ' steak dinners and upholstery . " You shoulda seen him , George doin ' this dumb cow voice , " Hey , man , you do n't love me for what I am . You love me for what I 'm gon na be  --  your suede leather shoes that walk you to get your all-beef cheeseburger which you pay for outta your genuine cowhide wallet . " SHOOTER This dude at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son ? " I started into this whole number like I had to explain , " Well , George , see , he 's Sondra 's father . Sondra , that 's my wife . But George , he 's also , well , my dad and George and this other man Willie , Willie he owns a pool hall , the three of them were real tight , and since Dad 's gone now , one helluva pool player , my dad , anyway , George and Willie are like , well , George is family about five ways , see ? " And on and on like that till finally he was givin ' me this crazy look so I slapped down all those hundreds and said , " Hey , man , just give me the chair , okay ? " p. 53 WILLIE White boy in here the other night would n't let me lift George up to the rail to shoot . Said he had to keep one wheel on the floor . SHOOTER Just letting anybody in here these days . WILLIE Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wanted to talk to the record player . I said it do n't talk , kid . He said , " No , man , you man , the record player . " Over the air he said that .

WILLIE Folks turn on the radio to hear the music , remember ? SHOOTER ( Opening the cue case . ) I 'll try to keep that in mind . WILLIE ( Closing the cue case . ) You 're hidin ' out tonight , are n't you ? Well , you ai n't hidin ' here . SHOOTER ( Getting his cue out of the case . ) What you mean is you do n't want nobody else hidin ' in your hole . Well , the " hole " population looks pretty sparse to me. p. 54 WILLIE Then what are you doin ' here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , man ? WILLIE Go home , boy . Get outta my hall . Go home . See your wife . SHOOTER Ah , now we 're gettin '  --  WILLIE Yeah , we 're gettin ' SHOOTER ( Looking for the felt brush . ) Nowhere , man . I 've had enough of this mother-hen shit . WILLIE Then quit playin ' rooster . ( A big laugh from Shooter . ) SHOOTER Oh I 'm so sorry . Did I interrupt your nap ? Did I disturb your dust ? WILLIE You 're sorry all right . Did I pay for you to be born ? Did I scrape up what was left of your old man when he died ? Now you go home when I tell you . SHOOTER I 'm what 's left of my old man . WILLIE Yeah . ( Unfortunately . ) SHOOTER And I did n't plan to be in Miami Beach when he died , it just happened . So , I 'd have done it . WILLIE But you did n't . I identified him . I carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . I paid for his funeral . p. 55 SHOOTER You got a plot out back for George when he goes ? Way you tell it , those guys ca n't even die without you . WILLIE Man in here the other night said you better not die without payin ' him his six thousand dollars you owe him . Said he 'd come to hell to get it . Left you this note . SHOOTER ( Crumpling up the note . ) Least thanks to me , you wo n't have to carry George . Just dig the hole , then wheel him outta here some night , bury him wheelchair and all . WILLIE You can have your chair back , boy . He do n't need your four-speed charity . SHOOTER Listen to you , giving away the cripple 's chair . And charity , my man , is building a ramp ( Pointing to the door. ) up to a pool hall . WILLIE ( Pointing to the cue . ) What you think you 're doin ' with that ? SHOOTER ( Swinging it around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . WILLIE Might as well , G.W. , ' cause you sure as hell do n't know nothin ' else to do with it . SHOOTER Least I ai n't forgot what it 's for . ( And he sets the cue ball on the head spot , taps it down to the foot rail so it rolls back to hit the tip of the cue in follow-through position. ) p. 56 WILLIE And I ai n't tryin ' to be somethin ' I ai n't . SHOOTER I 'm his kid . WILLIE You got his name . SHOOTER Yes sir . I 've got the prize-winning best of the Three Blind Mice . I 've got ol ' Shooter 's name , I 've got George 's only child , Sondra . And now I 've got my own private pool palace . WILLIE Think so , huh ? SHOOTER But not for long , right , Willie ? You ai n't the only nigger got spies . Man down at the station owns a part of Baskin-Robbins told me the chain needs a downtown shop and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rum Raisin makes a nice offer . WILLIE You heard wrong . I ai n't sellin ' . SHOOTER The hell you ai n't . Come on , Willie , all the old pool players go to Asbury Park to die . Pool player 's paradise . Big tournaments , best players coming through all the time . Then just eight miles up the Jersey coast you got the ponies running at Monmouth Park . And gambling in Atlantic City . Do n't blame you for goin ' , Willie . WILLIE This place is a firetrap . Who 'd want it ? SHOOTER You might as well tell me , Willie , ' cause I got the picture already . Wake up about noon , spend a coupla hours with the racing form , then go for a swim , well , more like a walk in the pool .

" So George says , " Let 's see your green , man . " Well , Shooter did n't have any , of course , so he says , " Bet the boy 's bed , buddy . " Now he goes real good for a while , but then he gets to the seven , and it 's plumb froze to the rail . He looks it over , checks the line , sets him a sweet rail bridge , pulls back to shoot . George waits for just the right moment and says , " Do de name Ruby Begonia ring a bell ? " SHOOTER And Dad miscued . WILLIE Then he hit George upside of the head . SHOOTER Then George went over and got my crib . WILLIE Bet 's a bet , boy . Came draggin ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George I am so tired of seein ' your face carryin ' out my furniture .

WILLIE ( Loving this . ) Yeah ! p. 69 SHOOTER And I pick up the phone and , Lord have mercy , it 's the police and they say they got three beat-up black men , all callin ' my name .

And George , if you do n't stop bleedin ' on my Buick , you gon na walk ! " SHOOTER It 's a wonder she did n't drive him straight to the Red Cross , sayin ' , " George here 's so anxious to give blood , he done started without you . Just catch a coupla pints and send him over to Willie 's when he dries up . " WILLIE ( Beginning to recover from the laughing . ) I 'd like to see your mama again . Maybe she 'll come visit .

WILLIE Says you can expect sixty maybe seventy in five years . SHOOTER And then what ? You ever seen any old DJs man ? You watch those records go around long enough , you start thinkin ' in circles , walkin ' in circles , talkin ' in circles . All I learned in five years is the names of eight hundred and ninety-two singing groups and how many people do n't have anybody to talk to late at night so they call up the " record player . " WILLIE So quit . SHOOTER And do what ? WILLIE You tell me . SHOOTER I do n't know . WILLIE There 's got ta be somethin ' you like to do . SHOOTER I like to play pool .

( Willie backs off stunned , but knows not to wait too long before he starts to talk again . ) WILLIE There 's about a billion jobs in this world . You think there ai n't one or two might make you happy ? SHOOTER ( Angry now . ) How am I supposed to know what makes me happy ? And what difference does it make ? You do n't work to be happy .

SHOOTER Gave the same advice , wore the same clothes , drove the same cars , drank the same beer , ' bout the same age , called themselves the Three Blind Mice . ( Willie does not appreciate Shooter giving away this information .
