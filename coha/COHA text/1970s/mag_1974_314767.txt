The runaway price of staples , a source of anguish to housewives and politicians , has spelled disaster to a considerably less vocal segment of U.S. society : the Southern moonshiner . All the essential ingredients of corn likker have skyrocketed : sugar ( up 300% in a year ) , grain and yeast , as well as the copper used for piping and kettles and the plastic jugs in which illicit hooch is transported and sold . A gallon of moonshine that used to sell for $1 now goes for $6 or more . As a result , the tide of " white whisky " that used to flow from Appalachian hills and hollers is now only a trickle . <P> Another reason for the decline of cottage distilleries is the influx of legitimate industry into the South , offering an economic alternative to young men who might formerly have opted for the still life .

The " revenoo " recently seized 1,146 gallons of ' shine ( worth up to $8,000 untaxed ) in Dawsonville , Ga. - their biggest local haul in four years . However , connoisseurs of corn complain that mass-production methods result in a relatively tasteless brew ( which also tends to lack the dead rats and flies that spiced old-time likker ) . White lightning may yet find its uses . Once , when an agent cleaned off his fingerprinting machine with some confiscated corn , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightning fast .
