part of a novel by James Jones SCENES FROM THE ALMOST REVOLUTION F RIDAY , MAY THE 24TH , HAD BEEN a pretty rough day , according to my transistor radio , a day full of demonstrations in cities all over France . Even the farmers out in the countryside were coming into the towns to demonstrate for more government protection of the small farmer and higher prices for French products . In Nantes , in Brittany , a mob of three thousand farmers and students had attacked a police headquarters with stones and bottles and then had cut down trees around it and tried to burn it down . And in Paris . people were out all over the place , and demonstrations were going on everywhere . After I had had dinner with Louisa Gallagher and Ferenc Hofmann-Beck , I decided to go out into the streets again . I had been going out every night since Monday . I had spent a lot of time with the Students ' Film Committee of the Odeon . It was quite easy to get to the Odeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Lemoine and around the side of the Pantheon . As 1 was leaving the Gallaghers ' apartment , Ferenc asked me to take him with me . He wanted to see it too , he said . I was a little taken aback . I already felt that it was dangerous enough for me myself to go out . I did n't relish having the added responsibility of Ferenc. , who had often confessed himself a physical coward , a hypochondriac , a hater of all forms of violence . Besides . it had finally begun to rain , making everything slipperier and more evil-seeming . The May rains the police officials bad waited for so hopefully in the beginning of the month had finally come  --  much too late to do anything about the Revolution , now , except to make everything worse . So I hesitated . But the crestfallen look on Ferenc 's face was too much for me . " Okay , " I said . " Come on , if you want to . But you have to follow me and follow my lead without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own . " The big grin that came over his large face was almost worth the decision . " I suppose I better take off my monocle ? And put on my glasses ? " he said thoughtfully . " If I were you , I 'd leave the monocle here , " I said . He nodded . " I 'll do just that . " And took it off with its black cord and laid it carefully on top of Louisa 's fireplace mantel . " One must n't go around looking like a bloody executive or aristocrat on a night like this , " he said . " What about me ? " Louisa said . " You 're staying here , " I said positively . " There 's no question about that . " " I think he 's absolutely right , dear Louisa , " Ferenc said gently . " I suppose so , " she said gloomily . When I looked back at her from the door , with Hofmann-Beck close on my heels like an eager mastiff , she looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferenc 's monocle , and smiled and nodded at me . " Well , come on , Ferenc , " I said . " Let 's go . Let 's get with it . " " I 'm right with you , buddy , " Ferenc said , a term he would never have used to anyone before meeting the Gallaghers . I nodded . " Do n't forget your raincoat , now . " " I think I had better leave my bowler here , and take one of Harry 's caps in the entry , " he said . We went out of the apartment and down onto the quay in the drizzle . It looked as though it might be letting up . W ELL , I SURE NEED NOT HAVE WORRIED about Ferenc . Underneath his layers of fat and hypochondria he had a pair of legs at least four times as strong as mine . And when he raised up and showed forth that chest of his , instead of letting it droop on his belly as he usually did , it had a girth half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was as strong as a lion , that young man , and at least as brave as a fighting bull . It appeared the drizzle was stopping . We crossed by the Pont de la Tournelle and started up the rue du Cardinal Lemoine . When we reached the Boulevard St. Germain. we turned up toward the Place Maubert and made our way cautiously past shops and restaurants which were all carefully shuttered and closed , The French know how to take care of their trade goods and property . Things like this have been happening to them since the beginning of the Middle Ages . But the goddamned French have something else about them , too . As we sauntered up the half-dark Boulevard toward the Place . the inhabitants of the apartments of the four- and five-story buildings above the ground-floor shops were out burning their uncollected garbage and trash in the center of the street . By a sort of common consent , nol led by generals or even by civic leaders , they had got together with their brooms and mops and rakes and squeegees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncollected trash out into a row in the middle of the Boulevard and were methodically and carefully burning it up . Somebody had figured out that the center of the Boulevard would be the best place to do it in order to do the least damage to the leafage of the flowering trees that lined the boulevards on both sides and helped to make Paris the Paris they loved and liked to live in . A hundred yards up the way . you could hear the fighting and shouting , but hack here here they were , all out helping to preserve themselves and their health and at the same time not destroy the beauty of their city , Paris . Old Paris . God , the things it had not seen were few . There was not any possibility of traffic now on the boulevards anyway . And all the way up to the Place Mauhert there was a long line of burning crates , cartons . old wet lettuce leaves , rotten tomatoes and fruit rinds and garbage , all of it being tended with old push brooms or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was enough to almost make me weep . For them . For all of us . When we got to the Place Maubert , it did not take long to see that the police had invested it . Beyond the Place , the police were lined up three or four deep in their black fighting raincoats , helmets , goggles , and shields . Somehow they had worked down from the Carrefour St. Michel and established a cutoff line here all across the Boulevard . They were not doing anything at all , just standing there . Some distance away there was a mob of citizens , on our downhill side of the street . They kept a respectful distance , fifty yards , say , and hurled insults at the cops . There were no students , now . Mainly , they were all dark Algerians . There was not one student involved that I could see . Of course , the area between Maubert and the river was all an Algerian quarter ? which had been hurt hard during the time of the Algerian War . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the no-man's-land between the rue Monge , where the mob was , and the police lines beyond the end of the Place . We were practically alone out there in the middle of the Place . " Are n't we rather vulnerable out here ? " Ferenc said from behind me . " I do n't think so , " I said . " Really . I mean , look at them . They 're not trying to hurt anybody . " " But we are very presentable targets , " Ferenc said in his best King 's English accent . " Cut the shit , " I growled , and then something strange happened to me , I discovered I had made up my mind to cross the Place , the no-man's-land , and pass peacefully through the police lines . Was I showing off for Ferenc ? Was I proving that I was an old hand at the Revolution ? Was I testing my own rather doubtful courage in some crazy way ? In any case , I absolutely knew suddenly that those police over there would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanely , clearly not armed with bottles or stones , and said to them , " Excuse me , but I live up there . " I knew they would not touch us . I just knew it , And I kind of wanted to walk up the rest of the poor old torn-up busted Boulevard . Just to see what had happened to it in the last twenty-four hours . I really do not know what came over me . Anyway I forged ahead out into the middle of the deserted Place and past the high stone pedestal from which the Germans had removed the metal statue of some unknown notable during the war to melt it down , and on toward the police line across the Boulevard . Ferenc was right behind me . I could hear his footsteps , and there was not one sign of faltering in them . Then , suddenly , at the sharp corner of the rue Lagrange after the Place , just at the little cafe . tabae there , two young Algerians in dark clothes leaped out straight in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved a paving stone at the police line . Then they leaped back , and ran around the sharp corner onto the rue Lagrange . I did not see where the pave landed . It either fell short or was blocked by a shield . A couple of the policemen shouted something back which 1 did not understand , but the voices had a plaintive note to them , as if they might have been saying in English , " Come on ! What are you doing , dumb-ass ! We 're not bothering you , are we ? " They threw no tear gas , or anything else , in retaliation . But suddenly my whole feeling changed . I could not be sure the police did not think we were friends of the Algerians , and were coming on to attack them . Probably they did n't . In any case , I did an abrupt about-face , with Ferenc right alongside me , and started walking slowly away . " That was rather bad luck , " Ferenc said in an even voice at my side , matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following my lead as I had asked . " Yeah , " I said . " It was . Come on , we 'll go up here . " And when we reached the pedestal , I took off across the empty Place toward the rue de la Montagne Ste.-Genevieve . Nobody contested us or bothered us . The rue de la Montagne Ste.-Genevieve is probably one of the most picturesque streets in all of Paris . It is full of tiny but very good restaurants , and mounts steeply and twisting from the Place Maubert up to the Pantheon on top of the hill . It is the street where Hemingway placed his bat-rnusette in the opening part of The Sun Also Rises , where Brett Ashley is introduced . I loved to walk it and used to eat there a lot . But now the street was so absolutely full of crates and cartons and garbagefrom the restaurants and the apartments above that you could hardly see any of the ground-floor windows or the painted names of the restaurants above them . It looked as though , if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go up in one great whoosh of flames . We came out on the rue des Ecoles halfway up . Now , the rue des Ecoles runs along the front of the Sorbonne itself . When I looked up that way , I could see that the place had been cordoned off by police units , and that the air was full of tear gas and smoke . I had a sudden fatigue reaction . " Let 's go the other way , " I said . But at the rue Monge we had the good fortune to witness how a Paris barricade is constructed , from its very beginning . A T THE CORNER OF THE RUE MONGE and the rue des Ecoles is a lovely little park called the Square Monge , with big trees behind which are visible the handsome old buildings of the Ecole Polytechnique . The park is surrounded by a handsome fence of wrought iron and has concrete benches both inside on the grass and outside on the sidewalk . When we arrived , a mob of people were just beginning to tear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stood back against a building catty-corner across the street , and watched . There was not one student involved in this barricade . These people were all Parisian workers of the lowest class . There were no Algerians among them . About one-sixth of them were women . And almost without exception , they all had such badly rotting , mangled teeth that I felt sorry for them all and wondered how they could ever manage to eat their own fabled Parisian cooking . They had crowbars and sledgehammers with them , and later we saw shovels . They shouted encouragement to each other in shrill voices as they tore up the lovely little park . The women were particularly good at the shouting part . But the women worked hard , too . Whenever someone grinned at me . I grinned back . I advised Ferenc to do the same . Directly in front of us , two men of about twenty-four began attacking the pavement with a crowbar . They were trying to force an initial opening between two paving stones . They kept at it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially bald man in a light beige raincoat walked up to them . Now , I do not know the mechanics of how the eyeball , all unwitting to the conscious mind , trains itself in an intelligent man to recognize a plainclothes cop . My eyeball , all on its own , can recognize an Algerian man or a Chinese man a block away by the back of his head . And my eyeball , again all on its own , can recognize an American in the city of Paris as far away as I can see him or her . It 's something about the stance , the way they walk , as if they felt guilty , and when they come closer , some look on their faces that my eyeball knows , but which I do not , confirms me . They are just American , that 's all . And I 've never been wrong , to my knowledge . And by the same token of eyeball judgment , I knew immediately that the man in the light beige raincoat was a plainclothes cop . Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded back . This was interesting . We strolled slowly over to where the two young men , now joined by a couple of others , were still trying intently to prize a paving stone from the tightly laid pavement . The man in the light raincoat had begun to remonstrate with them about why they wanted to do it . He talked calmly and objectively : there were no police around to fight ; if they prized up the street , it would only bring the police : what was it they were after ? I do not think a soul there except us two knew he was a plainclothesman . But a crowd began to collect . He was certainly a gutsy cop . Slowly the voices got louder . They were talking French so fast , all of them , that I could n't make out what forms the discussion was taking . But several citizens were taking the side of the man in the light raincoat . They did not prevail , however ; crowbars and youthful adrenaline prevailed , and when this became apparent the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman 's shrug , and sauntered away , probably to telephone headquarters about what was happening at the rue Monge and the rue des Ecoles . Ferenc and I backed away and stood again back against the building . It was a fascinating thing to watch . It took them quite a long time to get the first paving stone out . But after that it became easier . And easier and easier the more stones they removed . Once they had a foot or two of the square stones up off their bed of sand , there was a great cheer all across the place and the shovels were brought in . And then it went fast . The men and women formed human chains to pass the stones which the shovelers were now loosening almost faster than they could be passed along . They wanted to make a V-shaped double barricade that would cut off the rue Monge from the Place Maubert downhill toward the river and would also cut off the rue des Ecoles from the west toward the Sorbonne . God knows who they were , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause or gain from it all . They were just there , and they were just doing it . To have stopped them would have taken machine guns . It was amazing how swiftly the barricade rose . The concrete benches from the lovely little park were stuck into it , while the beautiful wrought-iron fence around the park was set in in sections along the face so that they stuck forth like spears in the direction  --  the two directions  --  from which the police , were expected to come . " I think it 's about time we moved on , " I said . I had not forgotten that gray-haired man in the light raincoat . Neither had Ferenc . " I expect so , " he said calmly . Then suddenly he grinned . " Thank you , " he said . " It 's been a great evening . " We sauntered on down the rue des Ecoles to where it crossed the rue du Cardinal Lemoine. not far , and turned back down Cardinal Lemoine toward our sanctuary of the Ile St. Louis . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's amazing , really , is n't it ? " Ferenc said in an odd voice . " Really , it is amazing . " O N SATURDAY MORNING , THE 25TH , Ferenc and I walked Louisa and McKenna , her daughter , up to the Boulevard St. Michel to view the devastation . It was unbelievable . All the way up St. Germain the streets were turn up , the tall gooseneck metal streetlamps were down , and turned-over , burnt-out cars had been dragged to the gutters , sometimes encroaching up onto the sidewalk itself . At the Place Matibert an innocent little newspaper-magazine kiosk had been torn completely apart and dismantled  --  for no apparently good reason , because it clearly had not been strewn on the barricades that had gone up there later in the night . At the rue St. Jacques more tipped-over cars had been dragged to the sidelines . Everywhere , work crews were trying to clean up . They were using bulldozers and those small one-man mobile cup-shovels and other pieces of road-building equipment . But this time there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road rollers were already pouring and tamping their hot , smelly asphalt into the place where the torn-up street had been cleared . People and students sat at the outdoor tables of the cafes having a coffee or an aperitif while the fumes from the asphalt rolled over them . But the worst place of all was the Carrefour , and the Boulevard St. Michel itself where it ran from there up to the Place Edmond Rostand at the corner of the Luxembourg . At the Carrefour itself nothing had been left standing . Nothing . And up the Boulevard at least one-third of the lovely old flowering trees , such a beautiful and distinctive part of Paris and of the Quartier , had been downed during the night and lay out in the street or up on the sidewalk almost to the storefronts . They could asphalt the boulevards , all right , but it would take a long time to replace those trees . Hundreds of people were out strolling to view the destruction . They climbed over the tree butts when they had to , or passed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We joined the parade . It was hard to believe where last night there had been such violence and wild emotion there was now such quiet and amiable calm . At the rue Racine there was a phenomenon I knew about , and 1 took the others to see it . The rue Racine was a short street which ran on an angle from Bour St. Michel to the Odeon and on it was a barricade which the students had come to call the barricade pure , the " pure barricade . " It had been there for at least two weeks and had never been removed . It was made of nothing except paving stones . That w as what made it " pure . " It had become a joke at both the Sorbonne and the Odeon . Nobody was allowed to put any streetlamps , trees , tree grilles , or traffic signs on it . I took a picture of McKenna standing up on top of it , from a squatting position in the street . Then , as an afterthought , I took one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought someday she might like to have it . I thought I could have one of the sides ground down smooth and polished and then engraved with the place and date of the Paris ReYulution for her . But then , after I had taken it , I felt peculiar walking along with it in my hand , as if some the I met might think I meant to heave it at him . So I stuffed it into the pocket of my trench coat , where it hung down so heavily that it made me look like some kind of semi-hunchback . So , in this odd fashion we made our way on up St. Michel to Edmond Rostand and had a coffee there at the big cafe on the corner across from the Luxembourg . Everyone in the cafe certainly seemed happy and cheerful enough . After that we walked over to the rue ' Bonaparte and took it down to the Place St. Germain and had lunch at Lipp 's , where everything was business-asusual . It was funny to note that at every table there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the tiny plastic plug in his ear for the news . A lady painter from our American group who lived near Maubert was with us , too , and we dropped her off at her place and went on home to the Ile . She . though I think not Louisa , was shocked as much as I was about the old trees . Louisa seemed to think it was all part of the revolutionary game . Like the old saw : I/ you wane to make an omelet , you have to break some eggs . A FTER SAYING GOODBYE TO FERENC and going home , I found I was n't able to sleep . After standing at my : windows with a drink for half an hour watching the heated glow in the sky over the Quartier , I got dressed and went out again . This time I went straight up Cardinal Lemoine , around the Pantheon , down through the Place Edmond Rostand , and straight over to the Odeon . It was still the same jammed-up crowding , screeching place it had been on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the excitement was more intense . There were noticeably fewer countesses and baronesses with their tall , black-tied escorts " touristing . " Finally I found Weintraub there in the crowded steaming little offices of the Comith du Citthnta des Etadiants de In Sorbonne . " Hey ! " he said cheerily , and came over to me . " I was wondering if you 'd show up tonight . " " I almost did n't , " I said . " But I could n't stay away . " " That 's the old revolutionary spirit . " Weintraub grinned and slapped me on the back . But for the first time I thought I could detect a haunted look underneath the grin . The usual groups of kids , all familiar faces by now , were all standing around the office . Daniel the chairman with the steel-rimmed glasses was behind his desk . The usual democratic discussion and voting was going on just the same , at full tilt . It had become an almost religious ritual for them by now . " What do the Film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked Weintraub . " Naturally , they think it 's all a deliberate ploy on the part of the government , " he said cheerfully . The government has been holding back , hoping the Revolution would ' rot ' itself out , as they say . When it did n't , they decided to send the police in again against the students , to make it so unpleasant for the people that they will turn against the students , stop all the strikes , and settle down and go back to work . In other words , the new fighting is to try and alienate the working people from the students and destroy the solidarity . " " Urn , " I said . I did not know if I could subscribe to that . " Well , that 's what they believe , " Weintraub said . " Especially now that talks are starting between the government and the unions tomorrow . " He added , " We 've got three crews out shooting the St. Michel fight tonight . " " They do n't really think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " We never talk about that . " He moved . " Let 's go in and have a coffee . " We moved past a democratic discussion of something or other chaired by Daniel , and went through the door into the " kitchen " part of the Film Committee 's " offices , " which by its other door led onto the tiny balcony high above the main amphitheater . The by-now almost goofy twenty-four-hour marathon discussion was still going on down there . But it had lost a lot of its energy , and most of its sense . There was a pot of stew simmering on one burner of the tiny butane hot plate and a pot of coffee on the other . There was one young couple necking on the mat in the corner but not , as far as I could see while trying not to look , doing more than that . Otherwise it was empty . " Did you see the ' hospital ' on your way up ? " Weintraub asked as we shut the door against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I came up the back stairs . " " They 've got over a hundred more in there now than they had on Wednesday , " Weintraub said . He got two grimy-looking cups . " They just wo n't turn themselves in to the regular hospitals because the police keep a check on them all and arrest everybody . " He poured the hot black coffee for us both and then sat down against the wall on a mat at the other end from the necking couple . I got down beside him , nursing the hot cup of horrible coffee . We both sat in silence for a while . Finally , Weintraub said . " There 's been another development . You know they stored all those cans of shot film at my place during that scare about a police raid . Well . they came and took them back after the police-raid scare was over , and all of them were kept out in the office there in those two big refrigerator boxes . There 's no way to get them developed here in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about ten days ago one of the kids on the committee came in here and took almost all of them , more than fifty , maybe sixty , sixty-five cans , that 's a lot of film , saying he had a ride to Italy that night in a private car and he would take the film to Italy with him and have it developed and bring it back . There was only one girl in the office at the time . She had no authority to say yes or no and she let him take them . They 've had no word from him at all since then , and they 've been beginning to get worried about the film . Do you know about all that ? " " No , I do n't , " I said . I had not heard anything about it at all . " Well , now they 've got some garbled message back from Italy saying that he lost them all in Rome . They were ' stolen ' from the back seat of his car during a riot , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a pretty garbled message . The kid who brought it back does n't even know him . And the kid himself who took them has n't come back . He 's still in Rome , trying to get a fix on where they went . " Weintraub smiled a bitter smile . " There seems to be some suspicion among the kids on the committee that he just swiped them and sold them in Rome . " " Jesus ! " I said . " But that 's irreparable . " " One had apple in the barrel , " Weintraub said . " That kind of a story . It sure is irreparable . Almost all the stuff they 've shot from the beginning up to then . All the demonstrations . All the stuff shot inside the Sorbonne . It 's more than irreparable . It 's a catastrophe . " " The idealistic students . " I said . " The idealistic students of the Comite du Cinima de la Sorbonne . " " Yeah , " Weintraub sighed . " The idealistic students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet what really happened . They 're just waiting to hear . " He shoved himself up from against the wall . He had emptied his cup . I got up myself . " Look , " he said , " do you want to go down and take a look at the old Boul ' St. Mich ' ? Have yojj been down there yet tonight ? We can get that boy Raymond to steer us all around . He 's well-known just about everywhere in the uartier now . " " No , I have n't yet , " I sai . " I 've been around other places , but not there . Okay , sure . Why not ? " The boy Raymond was out in the office , where some other heated democratic discussion was going on chaired by the tireless Daniel , the subject changed apparently . Raymond had sort of become my official conductor everywhere since he had first shown me the committee 's offices and the balcony over the theater a week before . He said he would be glad to take us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handkerchief if we get anywhere near to the Carrefour , " he smiled . " Tear gas . " I nodded and said I had one , and then he took us down past the moaning hospital and out through the kids with the chains around heir necks , who were certainly not students . All of them were clearly low-class kids , grammar-school dropouts who had not even made it to lycee , but they were having the time of their lives with their chains and their authority as guardians of the Revolution . Out in the street we made our way across the crowded Place toward the rue Racine and down it past the barricade pure to the Boulevard . There was room to get past it on the sidewalk . At the Odeon there had been gangs of students up on the high roof , armed with garbage-can lids for shields and wearing weird-looking Roman or Gothic or Frankish helmets . They had found stores of these among the theater 's costuming department . They shouted down from the high roof unintelligible comments while brandishing their shields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on St. Michel we found more gangs of similarly uniformed students moving along toward the fight or else away from it . There seemed to be little order to their movement . They all wore handkerchiefs around their necks ready to be pulled up over their noses in the tear gas . Raymond really was quite small . He spoke no English at all and we spoke to him all the time in French . He was considerably older than the others , twenty-five or - six , He seemed to he more reflective , sweeter-looking and more nonviolent-looking than anyone I had seen around . He had been doing graduate studies in Cintota at the Sorbonne before the Revolution . He wanted to be a film director . As we moved along , he was hailed by students from all the groups we passed . " Tell inc , ' I said . " du you think Daniel the chairman could perhaps be a foreign agent ? " We were standing an the corner of the Boulevard now , by the little bookshop there . The wide street was jammed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sides and hoods , driven by shouting students . were honking and trying to get through the press . Some were going toward the fighting and some away from it . " I have thought of that . " Raymond looked at me with smart eyes and smiled his gentle smile . " No , I do not think he is . He has a strange accent . That is all . Well , he is Swiss . " " He also has the look of a dedicated Commissar , " I said . " And those ancient-style steel-rimmed glasses of his . Very Russian . " " That is true , " Raymond smiled . " But no , I do riot think he is . In any case we must use what we have at hand . Shall we go on ? Or stop here ? " " No , let 's go on . " We were able to get down to the Carrefour . It was only a short distance , and the actual fighting at the moment was further down toward the river . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear gas coming up down there nearer to the Place St. Michel , and could hear the shouts and the chanting . Across St. Germain , gangs were ripping up what was left of the street , pulling down traffic signs and streetlamps to make a barricade . Up St. Germain two hundred yards , at the rue Danton , a police cordon blocked that boulevard , but they were not moving . Suddenly , in front of us at the Carrefour , four tough , vicious , ratlike individuals , in their early twenties I guessed , snaked up across the sidewalk and began dismantling with great efficiency the protective pedestrian railings that ran around the corner of the sidewalk . These consisted of eight or ten iron pipes set into the concrete and connected by chains . One individual opened the end links with a large switchblade as a lever , then carefully closed the links and draped the chains around his neck . Two others equipped with hacksaws began sawing off the pipes at the ground to use as clubs . The fourth collected the pipes as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be army fatigues and they wore the round-topped American-style forage caps pulled far down onto their ears with the brims turned flat up . They did not talk and their faces were absolutely cold , concentrated , and expressionless . When they had demolished the pedestrian railing , they snaked back across the sidewalk and disappeared as they had come , down toward the fighting . " Did you see those types ! " I said . Raymond , beside me , made an embarrassed gesture . " It is no longer under our control , you know . It has not been since last night . " " But you have a lot of them working for you at the Odeon . " Again Raymond made an embarrassed smile . " That is true . And not only at the Odeon . " " They gave me a chill up my back , " 1 said . " Me , too , " Weintraub said simply . " I would gladly knock those four young gentlemen off with a machine pistol , and feel no qualms , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they would do the same for you , " Weintraub said . Then he laughed , in his deepest voice . " I am sure they would , " I said . " We no longer have control , " Raymond said apologetically . " It has become completely out of hand . " I was n't angry any longer . Certainly not at small , gentle Raymond . " But when you did have control , you still were hiring types like those , " I said . " Tell me , do you not find a philosophical discrepancy in what you students declare are the aims of your Revolution and in the fact that you hire gutter storm troopers like that to fight for you ? " He smiled ruefully . " Of course , it is there . But the police and the government forced us to it . I could not get out on those barricades and fight like that . would n't have a chance . " " You are small , but you are not smaller than those four boys , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in uniform , either , " Raymond said . " It is not a question of the size . It is a question of the temperament . Of the mentality . I could not do it . " " But lots of the students have . " " Yes , but you do not know that in the fighting , the real fighting , they were fighting always side by side with boys like those four . " " No , I did not know . that , " I said . " The only answer I can give you is that when we have won , when the Gaullist government is toppled and replaced by a truly Socialist government , we will try to rectify all the bad things we had to do to achieve it . " " Yes , " I said . " And the government says that , too . " " T know it , " Raymond said . " I know they do . But it is the only honest answer I can give you . " " And you really think you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out here , " Raymond said . " You see ? " Weintraub said to me . We were still standing near the corner of St. Germain . Behind us a spluttering , chattering noise started up . loud even in the noise of the fighting . We turned around to look . A crowd of people had gathered around one of the huge old flowering trees . It was impossible to see what was going on and we walked back up to look . Two young men had attacked the big old tree with gasoline-driven chain saws . They looked absolutely hysterical . As the saws cut through the tree , the crowd around moved fast suddenly , to get out of the way . " We better get back , " Weintraub shouted to us . We backed off further up the Boulevard , watching . There was a warning shout , and the great tree came down into the Boulevard , where a group of students had cleared a space for it and were holding hands to hold back the crowd . I looked at Raymond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " I said . " Let 's go back to Odeon . " Further up the Boulevard on our way to the rue Racine , two other youths with big double-bitted woodsmen 's axes were attacking another of the big trees . " It will take a long time for your government to rectify that , " I said as we turned into Racine , " do n't you think ? " " I hate to see it as much as you do , " Raymond said . " Believe me , if I were giving the orders , I would not give such an order , or allow it . But now , now nobody is giving orders . It is completely out of hand . " " I do not think you can win , " I said bluntly . " De Gaulle is tough . And the people will get tired of the discomfort and the misery . The workers will take what they can get from the Patronat and give up and go back to work . And they will be worse off than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Revolution is doing to those trees along the Boulevard , it is also doing to the national economy of France . " " At least we will have made an impression , " Raymond said . " Our existence will be proved . " At the corner of the rue Monsieur-le-Prince I left them and cut back up toward the top of the Boulevard and the rue Souffiot . I could not stand the thought of going back to the Odeon with them , or even without them . The narrow old street was filled with a thick mist of tear gas that made my eyes smart badly . I had to pick my way over the remains of barricades and debris , and around the weirdly dressed student fighters who moved along it . At the top of the Boulevard at the Place Edmond Rnstand where the crowds ceased , I stopped just once and looked down the strife-torn Boulevard , then went on home by Cardinal Lemoine feeling very very down . ?                @ @ @ @ @
