The changes in new models should be so novel and attractive as to create dissatisfaction with past models . Automobile design is not , of course , pure fashion , but the laws of Paris dressmakers have come to be a factor in the automobile industry . Woe to the company which ignores them . <P> - Alfred P. Sloan Jr . <P> Ever since 1928 , when General Motors first introduced yearly style changes , Sloan 's Law has been reaffirmed at every annual new model preview . But this year , the tradition of a new style every autumn is being ignored by both the biggest and the smallest of Detroit 's automakers-G.M. and American Motors . They are postponing cosmetics to concentrate on Government demands for safety and engineering improvements , many of which are only in the design stage . Shock-absorbing bumpers , for example , will be required by law in 1973 ; passenger safety restraints that will work automatically in a collision are slated for 1974 ; and in 1975 , emission-control systems will have to cut exhaust pollution almost to zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says a company engineer : " Our styling and design departments are almost nonexistent . All the money is going for emission and safety research . " <P> Rare Test . By contrast , Ford and Chrysler , who must meet the same Government requirements , decided that they had to have styling changes this year as well . The fate of the new models in the showrooms will thus provide a rare test of Sloan 's Law . Chrysler Corp . is promoting style changes in such full-sized models as the Plymouth Fury , Dodge Polara and Monaco , and Chrysler Newport , New Yorker and Imperial . Newly sculpted body and roof lines , and new front and rear styling will be the big difference . Says Elwood P. Engel , Chrysler 's vice president of styling : " Buying a car is like buying a suit . Nobody wants one with narrow lapels . People who buy Valiants and Darts may buy a car just for transportation , but a person who spends $4,000 to $5,000 for a car wants to be different . " Apparently on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bigger than the 1971 model both inside and out , and its V-shaped nose has been slightly blunted . The Ford Torino will have a new oval-shaped grille , and the Continental Mark IV will be 4 in. longer . The Mercury Montego , which has not sold well in 1971 , is being made to look like the better-selling Ford LTD . <P> The six A.M.C. cars unveiled last week were mirror images of their 1971 counterparts on the outside . Inside , though , the sporty Javelin will feature optional trim and upholstery by Fashion Designer Pierre Cardin of Paris ; the Hornet wagon can be had with finishing touches by Aldo Gucci , Italy 's famed designer of leather accessories . Instead of new body styling , or the wide variety of models offered by its competitors , A.M.C. is making its major move in the area of warranties . Starting with the 1972 models , the company will pay for the repair of all defects during the first twelve months or 12,000 miles of use-an improvement on the usual tightly restricted list of warranty-covered parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own autos are being worked on .
