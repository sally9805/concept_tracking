THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment S we read , these days , one sour decade-wrapup after another , we wonder if it is the desperate thirties or the murderous forties that are being comparativel ) cherished , or if the frightened fifties are the focus of to much nostalg ; a . Certainl ) the sixties had their miseries  --  their assassinations and their massacres , their unsolved ( though not unrecognized ) problems of race , pollution , arms , poverty , and power . It was a bad decade for sacred cows , for deans , for policemen , and for the Pentagon ; it was a very bad decade , in America , for the Appalachian poor , the urban blacks , the Indians , the Mexicans , and all the others who found themselves left behind by the boom ; it was a horrendous decade for the Vietnamese , for the Biafrans , and for hundreds of thousands of American servicemen . And this by no means completes the list . Egyptian soldiers , Soviet writers , Rhodesian natives , Calcutta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all suffered , in a world where hunger and homicide , at least , should he anachronisms . No accounting can counterbalance or eradicate these abysmal debits in the human record . Yet this was also a decade in which millions were allowed to die peacefully in their beds , in which millions were born into a world freer of contagious diseases than before , in which billions were allowed to roughhew their professional and erotic destinies under something like stable conditions . The great powers , though they did not sacrifice enough of their pride and private designs , did avoid clashing ; the nuclear dragon slumbered on . Technology continued to roll up its enigmatic triumphs , challenging men to use it wisely . And a number of illusions noisily fell . The last , eroded suspicion that war is glamorous and tolerable may have crumbled during the decade , and the middle-aged white males who run this country found their minority rule interestingly questioned by the young , the black , and the female . Much of the protest , however unseemly in its incidentals , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthily toward revised assumptions and broadened franchises . The American decade most like the nineteen-sixties was perhaps the eighteen-fifties , a strident and polarized period in which extremists , for a fatal interval , seized leadership and made disruption fashionable . President Buchanan used to speak of " the conservative mass , " much as President Nixon speaks of " the silent majority . " The paradox of the eighteen-fifties is that its stresses  --  and its holocaustal denouement of civil war  --  were the outcome of growth ; its miscalculations were the fruit of optimism . Except for one brief panic , the trend was upward : our crops flourished , our industries prospered , our literature came to maturity . Similarly , this past decade saw much positive good , even in the unfashionable areas of congressional legislation and international negotiation . A dinner partner of ours the other night , a woman with some experience of political persecution and exile , ventured the startling thought that our children , or their children , may look back upon this winter of so much discontent as a golden age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plagues upon us than for the plagues we have avoided or forestalled . The sixties should not be allowed to slip into history without some grateful acknowledgment of the new joyousness they brought to the texture of daily life , A new latitude in costume and manners , a new willingness to " dig " instead of judge , a new tenderness , whose symbol everywhere is the flower ; the joyousness of the Beatles and of the slogan " Black Is Beautiful , " of Pop Art and of male hair ; the joyous politics of the tragic Kennedy 's , and the joyous technology of the Apollo moon shots : may these scattered stars light us into the future . Cats WE 'RE happy to report that the First International Cat Film Festival , which we attended the other afternoon , was one heck of a nice film festival . Intercat ' 69 , as the festival was also called ( inevitably ) , took place at the Elgin Theatre , on Eighth Avenue at Nineteenth Street , and it consisted of four solid hours of cat movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sad , ranging in length from ninety seconds to twenty-eight minutes and in style from traditionally cute animation to paw-held an-ten , . cinema . One does n't just walk into an event of this kind without some background information , and before the show we had a word with its organizer , Pola Chapelle . Miss Chapelle , a pretty brunette who used to be a night-club singer , told us she had put the festival together because she loves cats and because she herself had made a cat movie and wanted to show it before an audience capable of appreciating it . " My original idea was that this would separate the real cat lovers from the fair-weather friends , " she said . " After four hours , I figured , there would n't he anybody left but the hard core . But the other day a friend of mine called and said , Pola , how can you do this You know I ca n't leave my cats alone for four hours . ' So now I 'm not sure . " We asked Miss Chapelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Intercat ' 69 is a benefit for needy cats , " she said . " We 're going to give the money to free-lancers , though  --  not to organizations . For instance , there 's a man who lives across from me who must spend ten dollars a week on cat food . He 's an unsentimental-seeming fellow  --  rather gruff , actually  --  but he feeds all the stray cats in the neighborhood . And there 's a lady on a Hundred and Third Street who has something like two dozen formerly homeless cats living in her apartment . If you hear of anybody like that , by the way , let me know . " We said we would , and headed for the balcony , where we sat for the next four hours . ( We 're hard-core , and our cat does n't mind being left alone for a while . ) The theatre was nearly full , and the audience included plenty of old folks and families with small children , in addition to the young and unattached who generally frequent film festivals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reliance that was almost feline , had brought along a thermos of coffee , and two girls on our left seemed continually amazed at how closely this or that cat on the screen resembled their own , We had been foolish enough to imagine that the cat movie , as a genre , would prove to be rather limited . We were soon relieved of this notion . The influence of the great directors was emphatically there . James Langlois 's " Fore-Footage , " for example , depicted a Vermont-bred cat giving himself a bath with unrelenting , Rossellini-like realism . The birth scene in Maya Deren 's and Alexander Hammid 's " The Private Life of a Cat " recalled . Ingmar Bergman 's little-known but excellent " Brink of Life , " and Peter Knuppcl 's " Oma , " in which an old woman plays with her kitten in a cemetery , muttering to herself in German the while , brought to mind the Swedish master 's darker viskins . Joyce Wieland 's " Catfood , " in which a tabby cat eats five large fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sausalito Cat , " by Viva , represented the Warhol school ; it consisted of painfully out-of-focus shots of the Sausalito waterfront interspersed with footage of a black cat standing in a doorway . Miss Cliapelle 's film , dramatically titled " Fishes in Screaming Water , " showed a marmalade-colored cat working to get some r.osehuds out of its water dish with all the oblivious determination of Chaplin 's little tramp . The film 's star , an animal named Mamticat , wrote the music herself by walking around on a piano , and we remembered with approval that Chaplin , too , had scored his own movies . Elsie Esposito 's ' ' Ti my " featured a series of kittens in thirties-style getups performing in Bushy . Berkeley fashion , and IValter Gutman 's " Orpheus and Vikanna , " in which a cat is petted by a scantily clad exotic dancer , owed much to the sensitivity of Russ Meyer . Carroll Ballard 's " The Perils of Priscilla , " a thriller about a Siamese left home alone , makes ample use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hickory Hill , " in which George Plimpton leads the viewer on a tour of a pet show on the grounds of M Ts . Robert F. Kennedy 's home , had the grainy authenticity of a Leacock Pennebaker film . In fact , as we discovered when the credits were shown , it was a Leacock Penni:baker film . Our favorite , though , was a classic ( 1941 ) " instructional film for the primary grades " called " Fluffy the Kitten , " which had been lent by the Museum of Modern Art Film Lihrary . In it a very small kitten goes through its dad ) routine of fun and mischief . Title cards saying things like " I am looking for a little mouse " and " Yum , pan ! " more than made up for the lack of a sound track . When the final title ( " Now I will look pretty to say goodbye . I hope you liked me " ) flashed on the screen , the audience cheered . Even the Supreme Soviet has never applauded more stormily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F , Hyde , due widow the celebrated Johnsonian scholar and collector , and a celebrated Jiihnsonian collector in her own right , Oxford University 's Bodleian Library , founded in 1598 by Sir Thomas Budley , THE NEW YORKER having its first extraterritorial show , at the Grolier Club , of which Mr. Hyde used to he president . There , in the company of Dr. Robert Shackleton , the Bodleian 's present librarian , we inspected an attractive medley of a hundred and fifty-six items , chosen less for rarity and value ( " There seemed no point in sending over a Gutenberg Bible , " Dr. Shackleton said ) than to illustrate the history of the Library and the generosity of its benefactors , many of them American . ( Its new , supplementary building , put up in 1939 , was financed largely by the Rockefeller Foundation , and the great painted ceiling of its old one was restored in 1963 by Mr. Hyde . ) The selections range chronologically from an Aramaic document , written on leather , of the fifth century B.C. to a print-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first exhibit to meet our eyes , a 1566 drawing of the Oxford Divinity School , with Duke Humfrey 's Library above it , shows the Bodleian 's fifteenth-century predecessor , which housed a collection of manuscripts given by Humphrey ( Webster and the Encyclopaedia Britannica favor that spelling , but the Library does n't ) , Duke of Gloucester , a younger brother of Henry V. This collection was dispersed , pre-Bodley , but three of its treasures were returned to Oxford . Two of them are at the Grolier  --  a fifteenth-century Milanese manuscript of the letters of the younger Pliny , and an assemblage of earlier Latin scientific treatises . We went on from the to a black-and-blue miniature of Bodley , a 1579 Chinese medical treatise , a 1675 engraving of the Library ( in which Dr. Shackleton pointed out the windows of his sequestered courtyard office ) , the draft for the Library 's first printed catalogue , and a Bodleian hook chain -- eight metal links fixed to a circular hasp . " All folio hooks in the Library-were chained until 1757 , " Dr. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sometimes think we should put chains on the readers . " We proceeded to " Tom Thumbe , His Life and Death " ( 1630 ) ; a 1641 Milton " Of Reformation Touching Church-Discipline in England , " inscribed by the author ; a Mexican codex , painted in muted reds , tans , and olive greens on deerskin ; a 1663 Indian Bible ( the first Bible to he printed in North America ) , originally presented by the Overseers of Harvard College to a Harvard benefactor ; a letter from Alexander Pope describing the Bodleian as a place " where it is always an Honour to he read ; " a 1613 London ? marine-insurance policv ; and a 1759 historical review of the Constitution and Government of Pennsylvania , printed in London and given to the Library by Benjamin Franklin in 1762 , when Oxford gave him on honorary LL.D . " We 've tried to emphasize in our selection how much the Library has owed to American friends , and how , here and there , it reflects your country , " Dr. Shackleton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Harvard broadside listing 1,193 graduates between 164-2 and 1733 ; " Adventures of Franklin , " an 18 ( 18 juvenile ; first editions of " Robinson Crusoe " and " Pamela " given by Bodley 's American Friends , a hands-across-the-sea group ; and a signed typescript message to Oxford from Franklin D. Roosevelt , delivered in 1941 , when Oxford gave him an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law . In the absence of the Presi- ? dent , the message was read by his envoy , General Edwin M. Watson . " At this point in the proceedings , " a typed parenthesis at its bottom notes , " General Watson will sing Carry me hack to Ole Virginny . ' " Another parenthesis , inserted in black ink in F.D.R. 's handwriting next to his signature , adds , " This is the original Watson baritone score .

" It was interesting to discover that insurance premiums are lower for air travel than for sea travel , by a ratio of three to one . The show will go to the Newberry Library , in Chicago , after New York , and then to the University of California at Los Angeles . " Two items brought out the jotter in us a first edition of Izaak Walton 's " Compkat Angler " and an 1852 " Ballad on the Death of the Duke of Wellington . " The " Angler " was opened to a cut of a pike and a passage that read : His feeding is usually fish or frogs , and sometime a weed of his owne , called Pikrei-weed , of which r told you some think some Pikes are bred ; for they have observed , that where no Pikes have been put into a Pond , yet that there they have been found , and that there has been plenty of that weed in that Pond , and that that weed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred will ever breed by generation as the others do , I shall leave to the disquisitions of men of more curiosity and leisure then Irk I profess my self to have . " The author made substantial changes in the ' Angler ' in later editions , " Dr. Shackleton said . The Ballad started out : o Britons give ear to these lines I relate , There was never a General more bolder The leader in war , the pilot in state , A noble and gallant old soldier . An engraved couple pointing to an engraved urn surmounted this tribute , which , we learned , was from the Bodleian 's John Johnson Collection of Ephemeral Printing . This was additionally represented at the Grolier , whose show is open to the public , by a ticket for Sir Joshua Reynolds ' funeral  --  engraved by Bartolozzi with a tombside woman and child  --  and four 1847 Austrian banknotes . Other exhibition surprises were Percy Bysshe Shelley 's rattle , with a gilt whistle at one end and a coral handle at the other , and an undated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became King George V to Dr. ( later Sir ) Henry Acland , a noted Oxford professor of medicine , to wit : dear doetoraeland I can not write a long letter because I am too young but hope when I get older i shall write well . George " We sometimes show this at the Library , " Dr. S. said . " It 's a very popular item . Our more austere colleagues thoroughly disapproved of putting the rattle in the show . We also have Shelley 's guitar and pocket watch . " We wound up cur tour with an appreciative look at the original manuscript of Kenneth Grahame 's " The Wind in the Willows , " which was opened to the first page of " Toad 's Adventures . " The author 's only son , for whom the hook was written , died while at Oxford , and his father made the Bodleian his ultimate heir . " Our royalties from ' The Wind in the Willows ' come to eight or ten thousand pounds a year , " Dr. Shackleton said .

" Farewell THE Dixie Kitchen , which closed down the other day , was a cafeteria in the basement of an ofEce building on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-eighth Street . It lasted forty-six years , and during all that time it served excellent food and charged very little  --  what its two proprietors , Mrs. Margaret Deane and Miss Ethel Dilman , liked to call " reasonable prices . " The hill of fare featured real American home cooking , with an emphasis on real Southern home cooking . There were dishes like smothered chicken , creamed sweet breads on toast , creamed chipped beef on toast , roast pork with gravy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly , baked eggs with broiled tomatoes , corn fritters with bacon ( seventy cents at lunch ) , fresh string beans , fresh Swiss chard , okra and tomatoes , stewed corn , apple pie , cherry pie , rhubarb-and-strawberry pie , pecan pit , floating island , brown betty , tipsy pudding , Lady Baltimore cake , cornbread , and sweet rolls . Every Friday , there was spoonbread . Usually , there was cider to drink . In the course of a number of years , we ate a great many lunches there , and we will miss the place very much . The Dixie Kitchen never advertised , except in the Christian Scirtace Monitar , and Mrs. Deane once said that it " did n't even have a decent sign " out in front of its only entrance , a door on Forty-eighth Street , But it wits always crowded anyway , and the businesslike hustle of its lunchtime patrons preserved it from ever acquiring any of the mannerisms of a tearoom . The Dixie Kitchen was the kind of place you took friends to , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then took friends to . It was an aunt of ours , a vigorous woman who had a job in midtown , who first took us there . She had been a regular there for years . She introduced us to Mrs. Deane , who usually sat in front of the food counter giving out checks , and thereafter , whenever we came in for lunch , Mrs. Deane would make a point of saying something like " Your aunt was in yesterday , " or " Your aunt just came in , and she 's sitting at a table over in the corner . " Mrs. Deane comes from the South . She grew up in Virginia , and attended the Randolph-Macon Woman 's College , in Lynchburg a college founded in 1891 by the Methodist Church . Miss Dilman is a Northerner , from the Finger Lakes country , north of Ithaca ; she 's a Vassar graduate . Miss Dilman always took on the job of baking the Dixie Kitchen 's pies when the pastry chef did n't come in , and she sometimes used to remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Kitchen . " A man once praised Miss Dilman 's pecan pie . She said later , " He came up to me and said , ' You know how to make it . You put salt in it . ' You do , too . " On one wall of the Dixie Kitchen there was a mural of the American countryside by an artist named Edwin Deming , who also painted murals for hotels in Glacier National Park , Mr. Deming was hired to do the mural for the Dixie Kitchen by the " I 'll grant you it 's got artistic integrity . Rut I 'm not booking you into the Helen Hayes , and that 's final . " ? a Great Northern Railroad , which once had a ticket office above the restaurant , and which fixed up the basement for Mrs. Deane and Miss Dilman when they moved in , in 1926 . The mural got darker and darker over the years ; it got so dark that it was hard to make out just what part of America it depicted . We once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumps represented the Rockies or the Palisades . The best-known work of art in the Dixie Kitchen was a signed reproduction of Edward Hopper 's painting of an all-night lunch counter . Mr. Hopper frequented the Dixie Kitchen , and he modelled the coffee urns in his painting after the coffee urns there . Almost every day except in the dead of winter , there was a vase of fresh tea roses on the cashier 's desk , where Mrs. Deane 's husband , a courtly man , often helped out with the bookkeeping . The roses were brought in by a black counterman named Bert North , who lived in New Rochelle and raised flowers in his garden . Bert North was known for his smile , and he always served very generous portions of meat and vegetables . Last month , Mrs. Deane and Miss Dilman decided that it was time for them to retire , and about two weeks ago they put up a hand-lettered sign on the wall behind the cashier 's desk which read , " We regret to announce that the Dixie Kitchen will close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal customers . Merry Christmas ! " When we heard about it , we went over to say goodbye to the two ladies  --  goodbye and thank you . We found Mrs. Deane and Miss Dilman seated at a table up near the front of the restaurant . Most of the customers had already gone home , and Miss Dilman was eating a bowl of bread and milk . We said what we wanted to say , and Mrs. Deane said , " Thank you very much . It seems as though people had just poured in to say farewell . We have made lots of nice friends , and it 's flattering and comforting to have them all so distressed . " Miss Dili-Ilan said , " It always amuses me that at Vassar I majored in math and German , and I ended up making apple pies . What a career ! " We said that we had always wanted to know what led the two ladies to go into the restaurant business . " Well , I was in Paris after the First World War , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Deane said . " So I came home thinking about it , and in Washington I ran into Ethel in the Allies Inn and got her interested , too . We gave up the idea very soon , however , and decided to open an American restaurant in New York instead . " Miss Ullman said , " I do n't know how we ever had the nerve to start . Now we are going to retire , and maybe we will get around to writing our hook someday . We have always wanted to write one , you know . It will be called Forty Years Under Fifth Avenue .
