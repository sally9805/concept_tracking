Almost from the moment it was born after World War I , the old League of Nations was doomed to failure largely because the U.S. refused to back it . Now the International Labor Organization , a vestige of the same Treaty of Versailles that set up the League , may die for similar reasons . By the end of this week , the Carter Administration will have to decide whether to keep the U.S. in the I.L.O . or withdraw its heavy support-currently a fourth of the 135-member organization 's $80 million annual budget . If the U.S. does withdraw , it would be a severe blow to the Geneva-based I.L.O . and mark the first time that the U.S. has pulled out of any international organization . <P> In its workaday achievements , the I.L.O . has been successful . It won the NObel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1969 for its wide-ranging efforts to upgrade the lot of the world 's workers . It is involved in vocational training in India and Morocco , management development in Pakistan and Tanzania ; it provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack economic expertise . The I.L.O . has made 152 recommendations to set international labor standards for working conditions , hours and vacations , and has begun moving on such newer issues as occupational disease and sex discrimination in jobs . I.L.O . specialists helped set up the U.S. Social Security system in 1934 . <P> But for years the I.L.O . ' s Communist and Arab member nations have used the organization , and particularly its annual meeting , as a forum for attacks against U.S. policy toward the Middle East and elsewhere . That has dismayed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO , both of which send delegates to I.L.O . meetings. - Says AFL-CIO Boss George Meany : " I have had to sit in plenary sessions with the I.L.O . where they compliment the Director General on his wonderful report . Then they would launch an attack on the United States of America/ ' <P> In 1975 the I.L.O. , pressured by its anti-Israel bloc , granted the Palestine Liberation Organization observer status at I.L.O . meetings . That prompted then-U.S . Labor Secretary John Dunlop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Henry Kissinger voiced concern over the " increasing politicization " of the I.L.O . One example : hasty condemnation of Israel for supposedly mistreating Arab workers in occupied territory . Such lack of due process , said Kissinger , is " in utter disregard of the established procedures and machinery , and is gravely damaging the I.L.O . and its capacity to pursue its objectives in the human-rights field . " On Nov. 5 , 1975 , he wrote a letter to Director General Francis Blanchard , giving the required two-year notice for pulling out of the I.L.O . Unless the Carter Administration acts , the withdrawal becomes effective this week .
