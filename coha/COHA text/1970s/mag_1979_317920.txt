JAKE 'S THING by Kings ley Amis Viking ; 276 pages ; $9.95 <P> The hero of Lucky Jim , Kingsley Amis ' first novel , was an exasperated rather than an angry young man . While characters out of John Osborne , Alan Sillitoe and others raged against the ossifying and stultifying British class system , Amis ' feckless young professor did his best to fit in . Unfortunately , or fortunately , Jim 's private loathing for the nest of ninnies that ruled his academic career kept coming to the fore . It was one thing to make secret faces when other backs were turned or to plan baroque revenges against his superiors , but quite another to wind up drunk on public occasions where prudence advised sobriety . Jim was finally booted , but Amis gave him a loud last laugh : he got the girl of his choice and a cushy job in London . <P> All that was 25 years ago . The inspired comedy of Lucky Jim has worn well , and so has Amis the man of letters . His characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown pinched and crabby with age . Jake Richardson , 59 , and his overweight wife Brenda have a problem . " I realized , " Jake explains to his doctor , " something that used to be a big part of my life was n't there any more . " That thing is sex . A brash American who leads an encounter group grudgingly attended by Jake puts the matter succinctly : " What 's with Jake is that he ca n't get it up any more , and what 's with Brenda is she thinks it 's her fault for having gotten middle-aged and fat , so she feels bad . " <P> This semipublic humiliation is only one of the affronts that Jake must bear . His psychiatrist lays out a rigid regimen to revive the patient 's libido . At night , Jake must plug himself into something called a nocturnal mensurator , a machine that registers and records signs of arousal during his sleep . He must buy and study " pictorial pornographic material " and also write out a sexual fantasy of his own imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , Jake conies up 73 words short , despite much padding : " With lazy languorous movements she peels off the dress and reveals herself as completely stark naked and utterly nude . " He and his wife doggedly engage in sessions of " nongenital sensate focusing . " Jake even allows himself to be tested , in a most undignified manner , before a group of attentive medical students . <P> Amis deftly exploits the comic possibilities of Jake 's ordeal , but the author has more on his mind , perhaps too much more , than comedy alone . Jake is a reactionary curmudgeon , and his view rules the novel . He may have a problem , but society is sick . He rejects his psychiatrist 's diagnosis of repressions : " I was doing fine when things really were repressive , if they ever were , it 's only since they 've become , oh , permissive that I 've had trouble . " In the end , Jake issues a jeremiad against his own treatment and therapy in general ; he also has traveled well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
