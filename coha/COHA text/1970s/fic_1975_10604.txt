PREPARATIONSNow the brougham pulled up to the door of the bank , and the driver jumped down to open the door . The president of Huddleston &; Bradford stepped down to the pavement . Mr. Edgar Trent was near sixty , his beard was gray , and he had a considerable paunch ; whether he was balding or not , Pierce could not discern , for a high top hat covered his head . " He 's a fat one , is n't he , " Agar said . " Watch , now , " Pierce said . At the very moment that Mr. Trent stepped to the ground , a well-dressed young man jostled him roughly , muttered a brief apology over his shoulder , and moved on in the rushhourcrowd . Mr. Trent ignored the incident . He walked the few steps forward to the impressive oak doors of the bank . Then he stopped , halting in mid-stride . " He 's realized , " Pierce said . On the street below , Trent looked after the well-dressed young man , and immediately patted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he sought was still in its place ; his shoulders dropped in relief , and he continued on into the bank . The brougham clattered off ; the bank doors swung shut . Pierce grinned and turned to Agar . " Well , " he said , " that 's that . " " That 's what ? " Agar said . " That 's what we need to know . " " What do we need to know , then ? " Agar said . " We need to know , " Pierce said slowly , " that Mr. Trent brought his key with him today , for this is the day of  --  " He broke off abruptly . He had not yet informed Agar of the plan , and he saw no reason to do so until the last minute . A man with a tendency to be a soak , like Agar , could loosen his tongue at an unlikely time . But no drunk could split what he did not know . " The day of what ? " Agar persisted . " The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edgar Trent 41 " You 're a tight one , " Agar said . And then he added , " Was n't that Teddy Burke , trying a pull ? " " Who 's Teddy Burke ? " Pierce said . " A swell , works the Strand . " " I would n't know , " Pierce said , and the two men left the building rooftop . " Cor , you 're a tight one , " Agar said again . " That was Teddy Burke . " Pierce just smiled . In the coming weeks , Pierce learned a great deal about Mr. Edgar Trent and his daily routine . Mr. Trent was a rather severe and devout gentleman ; he rarely drank , never smoked or played at cards . He was the father of five children ; his first wife had died in childbirth some years before and his second wife , Emily , was thirty years his junior and an acknowledged beauty , but she was as severe in disposition as her husband . The Trent family resided at No. 17 Highwater Road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not including servants ' quarters . Altogether , twelve servants were employed : a coach driver , two liverymen , a gardener , a doorman , a butler , a cook and two kitchen assistants , and three maids . There was also a governess for the three youngest children . The children ranged in age from a four-year-old son to a twenty-nine-year-old daughter . All lived in the house . The youngest child had a tendency to ; somnambulation , so that there were often commotions at night  --  hat  --  roused the entire household . Mr. Trent kept two bulldogs , which were walked twice a day , at seven in the morning and at eight-fifteen at night , by the cook 's assistants . The dogs were penned in a run at the back of the house , not far from the tradesmen 's entrance . Mr. Trent himself followed a rigid routine . Each day , he arose at 7 a.m. , breakfasted at 7:30 , and departed for work at42 PREPARATIONS 8 : io , arriving at 8:29 . He invariably lunched at Simpson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank promptly at 7 p.m. , returning home no later than 7:20 . Although he was a member of several clubs in town , he rarely frequented them . Mr. Trent and his wife went out of an evening twice in the course of a week ; they generally gave a dinner once a week and occasionally a large party . On such evenings , an extra maid and manservant would be laid on , but these people were obtained from adjacent households ; they were very reliable and could not be bribed . The tradesmen who came each day to the side entrance of the house worked the entire street , and they were careful never to associate with a potential thief . For a fruit or vege- table hawker , a " polite street " was not easily come by , and they were all a close-mouthed lot . A chimney sweep named Marks worked the same area . He was known to inform the police of any approach by a lurker seeking information . The sweep 's boy was a simpleton ; noth- ing could be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made his rounds once every seventeen minutes . The shift changed at mid- night ; the night man , Howell , made his rounds once every sixteen minutes . Both men were highly reliable , never sick or drunk , and not susceptible to bribes . The servants were content . None had been recently hired , nor had any been recently discharged ; they were all well- treated and loyal to the household , particularly to Mrs. Trent . The coach driver was married to the cook ; one of the livery- men was sleeping with one of the upstairs maids ; the other two maids were comely and did not , apparently , lack for male companionship  --  they had found lovers among the serv- ing staff of nearby households . The Trent family took an annual seaside holiday during the month of August , but they would not do so this year , for Mr. Trent 's business obligations were such that he was re- The Routine of Mr. Edgar Trent 43quired to remain in town the whole of the summer . The family occasionally weekended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , but during these outings most of the servants remained in the mansion . At no time , it seemed , were there fewer than eight people residing in the house . All this information Pierce accumulated slowly and carefully , and often at some risk . Apparently he adopted various disguises when he talked with servants in pubs and on the street ; he must also have loitered in the neighborhood , observingthe patterns of the house , but this was a dangerous practice . He could , of course , hire a number of " crows " to scout the area for him , but the more people he hired , the more likely it was that rumors of an impending burglary of the Trent mansion would get out . In that case , the already formidable problems of cracking the house would be increased . So he did most of the reconnaissance himself , with some help from Agar . According to his own testimony , by the end of August Pierce was no further ahead than he had been a month before . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent . " No vices , no weaknesses , no eccentricities , and a wife straight from the pages of a handbook on dutiful attention to the running of a happy household . " Clearly , there was no point in breaking into a twenty-threeroommansion on the off chance of coming upon the hidden key . Pierce had to have more information , and as he continued his surveillance it became evident that this information could be obtained only from Mr. Trent himself , who alone would know the location of the key . Pierce had failed in every attempt to strike up a personal acquaintance with Mr. Trent . Henry Fowler , who shared with Pierce an occasional gentleman 's evening on the town , had been approached on the subject of Trent , but Fowler had said the man was religious , proper , and rather a bore in conversation ; and he added that his wife , though pretty , 44 PREPARATIONSwas equally tedious . ( These comments , when brought forwardinI tria estlmony , caused Mr. Fowler considerable embarrassment , but then Mr. Fowler was confronted with much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to such an unappetizing couple . Nor could he approach Trent directly , pretending business with the bank ; Henry Fowler would rightly expect that Pierce would bring any business to him . Nor did Pierce know anyone except Fowler who was acquainted with Trent . In short , Pierce had no gammon to play , and by the first of August he was considering several desperate ploys  --  such as staging an accident in which he would be run down by a cab in front of the Trent household , or a similar episode in front of the bank . But these were cheap tricks and , to be effective , they would require some degree of genuine injury to Pierce . Understandably , he was not happy at the prospect , and kept postponing the matter . Then , on the evening of August 3rd , Mr. Trent suddenly changed his established routine . He returned home at his usual time , 7:20 , but he did not go indoors . Instead , he went directly to the dog run at the back of the house , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal elaborately , he climbed back into his waiting carriage and drove off . When Pierce saw that , he knew he had his man . CHAPTER 10A Made DogNot far from Southwark Mint was the livery stable of Jeremy Johnson &; Son . It was a smallish establishment , quartering perhaps two dozen horses in three wooden barns , with hay , saddles , bridles , and other apparatus hanging from rafters . A casual visitor to this stable might be surprised to hear , instead of the whinny of horses , the predominant sound of barking , growling , snarling dogs . But the meaning of those sounds was clear enough to frequenters of the place , and no cause for particular comment . Throughout London , there were many reputable establishments that operated a side business of training fighting dogs . Mr. Jeremy Johnson , Sr. , led his red-bearded customer back through the stables . He was a jovial old man with most of his teeth missing . " Bit of an old gummer myself , " he said , chuckling . " Does n't hurt the drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slapped the hindquarters of a horse to push it out of the way . " Move on , move on , " he said , then looked back at Pierce . " Now what is it you 'll be wanting ? " " Your best , " Pierce said . " That 's what all the gentlemen are wanting , " Mr. Johnson said , with a sigh . " None wants else than the best . " " I am very particular . " " Oh , I can see that , " Johnson said . " I can see that , indeed . You 're seeking a learner , so as to polish him yourself ? " " No , " Pierce said , " I want a fully made dog . " " That 's dear , you know . " 46 PREPARATIONS " I know . " " Very dear , very dear , " Johnson mumbled , moving back through the stable . He pushed open a creaking door , and they came into a small courtyard at the rear . Here were three wood-boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caged dogs on all sides . The dogs yelped and barked as they saw the men . " Very dear , a made dog , " Johnson said . " Takes a proper long training to have a good made dog . Here 's how we do . First we gives the dog to a coster , and he jogs the dog day and day again  --  to toughen him , you know . " " I understand , " Pierce said impatiently , " but I  --  " " Then , " Johnson continued , " then we puts the learner in with an old gummer  --  or a young gummer , as the case is now . Lost our gummer a fortnight past , so we took this one "  --  he pointed to a caged dog  --  " and yanked all the teeth , so he 's the gummer now . Very good gummer he is , too . Knows how to worry a learner  --  very agile , this gummeris . " Pierce looked at the gummer . It was a young and healthy dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continued to snarl and pull back its lips menacingly . The sight made Pierce laugh . " Yes , yes , ' t is a bit of a joke , " Johnson said , moving around the enclosure , " but not when you get to this one here . Not here , there 's no joking . Here 's the finest taste dog in all London , I warrant . " This was a mongrel , larger than a bulldog , ... and parts of its body had been shaved . Pierce knew the routine : a young dog was first trained in sparring bouts with an old and toothlessveteran ; then it was put into the pit with . a " taste dog , " which was expendable but had good spirit . It was in the course of sparring with the taste dog that the learner acquiredthe final skills to go for the kill . The usual practice was to shave the vulnerable parts of the taste dog , encouraging the learner to attack those areas . A Made Dog 47 " This taster , " Johnson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions than you can name . You know Mr. Benderby 's dog , the one that bested the Manchester killer last month ? Well , this taster here trained Mr. Benderby 's dog . And also Mr. Starrett 's dog , and  --  oh , a dozen others , all top fighting dogs . Now Mr. Starrett himself , he comes back to me and wants to buy this very taster . Says he wants to have him to worry a badger or two . You know what he offers me ? Fifty quid , he offers me . And you know what I say ? Not on your life , I say , not fifty quid for this taster . " Johnson shook his head a little sadly . " Not for badgers , anyhow , " he said . " Badgers are no proper worry for any fighting dog . No , no . A proper fightingdog is for your dogs , or , if need be , for your rats . " He squinted at Pierce . " You want your dog for ratting ? We have special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch less dear , is why I mention it . " " I want your very best made dog . " " And you shall have it , I warrant . Here is the devil 's own , right here . " Johnson paused before a cage . Inside , Pierce saw a bulldog that weighed about forty pounds . The dog growled but did not move . " See that ? He 's a confident one . He 's had a good mouthful or two , and he 's well made . Vicious as ever I saw . Some dogs have the instinct , you know  --  ca n't be taught ' em , they just have the instinct to get a good mouthful straightaway . This here one , he 's got the instinct . " " How much ? " Pierce said . " Twenty quid . " Pierce hesitated . " With the studded leash , and the collar and muzzle , all in , " Johnson added . Pierce still waited . " He 'll do you proud , I warrant , very proud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want your best dog . " He pointed to the cage . " This dog has never fought . He has no scars . I want a trained veteran . " 48 PREPARATIONS The Destruction of Vermin 49 " And you shall have him , " Johnson said , not blinking . He moved two cages down . " This one here has the killer instinct , the taste of blood , and quick ? Why , quicker than your eye , he is , this one . Took the neck off old Whitington 's charger a week past , at the pub tourney  --  perhaps you was there and saw him . " Pierce said , " How much ? " " Twenty-five quid , all in . " Pierce stared at the animal for a moment , then said , " I want the best dog you have . " " This is the very same , I swear it  --  the very dog that 's best of the lot . " Pierce crossed his arms over his chest and tapped his foot on the ground . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fancy and most excellent in all respects . " Pierce just stared at him . " Well , then , " Johnson said , looking away as if embarrassed , " there is one more animal , but he 's very special . He has the killer instinct , the taste of blood , the quick move , and a tough hide . This way . " He led Pierce out of the enclosed courtyard to another area , where there were three dogs in somewhat larger pens . They were all heavier than the others ; Pierce guessed they must weigh fifty pounds , perhaps more . Johnson tapped the middle cage . " This'un , " he said . " This'un turned felon on me , " he said . " Thought I 'd have to top him off  --  he was a felon , pure and simple . " Johnson rolled up his sleeve to reveal a set of jagged white scars . " This'un did this to me , " he said , " when he turned felon . But I brought him back , nursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit , see , and the spirit 's everything . " " How much ? " Pierce said . Johnson glanced at the scars on his arm . " This'un I was saving  --  " " How much ? " " Could n't let him go for less'n fifty quid , beg pardon . " " I will give you forty . " " Sold , " Johnson said quickly . " You 'll take ' im now ? " " No , " Pierce said . " I 'll call for him soon . For the moment , hold him . " " Then you 'll be putting a little something down ? " " I will , " Pierce said , and gave the man ten pounds . Then he had him pry open the dog 's jaws , and he checked the teeth ; and then he departed . " Damn me , " Johnson said after he had gone . " Man buys a made dog , then leaves him . What 're we up to today ? " CHAPTER 11The Destruction of VerminCaptain Jimmy Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sporting pubs , the Queen 's Head , off Windmill Street . A visitor to that pub on the evening of August i o , 1854 , would be greeted by a most peculiar spectacle , for althoughthe pub was notably low-ceilinged , dingy , and cheap , it vas filled with all manner of well-dressed gentlemen who rubbed shoulders with hawkers , costers , navvies , and others of the lowest social station . Yet nobody seemed to mind , for everyone shared a state of excited , noisy anticipation . Furthermore , nearly everyone had brought a dog . There were dogs of all sorts : bulldogs , Skye terriers , brown English terriers , and various mongrels . Some nestled in the arms of their owners ; others were tied to the legs of tables or to the footrailof the bar . All were the subject of intense discussion and50 PREPARATIONSscrutiny : they were hefted into the air to gauge their weight , their limbs were felt for the strength of bones , their jaws opened for a look at the teeth . A visitor might then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected this same interest in dogs . Studded leather collars hung from the rafters ; there were stuffed dogs in dirty glass boxes mounted over the bar ; there were prints of dogs by the hearth , including a famous drawing of Tiny , " the wonder dog , " a white bulldog whose legendary exploits were known to every man present . Jimmy Shaw , a burly figure with a broken nose , moved about the room calling , " Give your orders , gentlemen , " in a loud voice . At the Queen 's Head , even the best gentlemen drank hot gin without complaint . Indeed , no one seemed to notice the tawdry surroundings at all . Nor , for that matter , did anyone seem to mind that most of the dogs were heavily scarred on the face , body , and limbs . Above the bar , a soot-covered sign read : EVERY MAN HAS HIS FANCY RA'rI'ING SPORTS IN REALITYAnd if people should be uncertain as to the meaning of that sign , their doubts ended at nine o'clock , when Captain Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the entire assembled company began to file toward the upstairs room , each man carrying his dog , and each man dropping a shilling into the hand of a waiting assistant before ascending the stairs . The second floor of the Queen 's Head was a large room , as low-ceilinged as the ground floor . This room was wholly devoid of furnishings , and dominated by the pit  --  a circular arena six feet in diameter , enclosed by slat boards four feet high . The floor of the pit was whitewashed , freshly applied each evening . As the spectators arrived on the second floor , their dogs immediately came alive , jumping in their owners ' arms , barkTheDestruction of Vermin Sing vigorously , and straining on the leashes . Captain Jimmy said sternly , " Now you gentlemen that have fancies  --  shut ' em up , " and there was some attempt to do this , but it was hardly successful , especially when the first cage of rats was brought forth . At the sight of the rats , the dogs barked and snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , waving it in the air ; it contained perhaps fifty scamperingrats . " Nothing but the finest , gentlemen , " he announced . " Every one country born , and not a water-ditch among ' em . Who wants to try a rat ? " By now , fifty or sixty people had crammed into the narrow room . Many leaned over the wooden boards of the pit . There was money in every hand , and lively bargaining . Over the general din , a voice from the back spoke up . " I 'll have a try at twenty . Twenty of your best for my fancy . " " Weigh the fancy of Mr. T. , " Captain Jimmy said , for he knew the speaker . The assistants rushed up and took the bulldog from the arms of a gray-bearded , balding gentleman . The dog was weighed . " Twenty-seven pounds ! " came the cry , and the dog was returned to its owner . " That 's it , then , gents , " Captain Jimmy said . " Twentysevenpounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a try at twenty rats . Shall it be four minutes ? " Mr. T. nodded in agreement . " Four minutes it is , gentlemen , and you may wager as you see fit . Make room for Mr. T. " The gray-bearded gentleman moved up to the edge of the pit , still cradling his dog in his arms . The animal was spotted black and white , and it snarled at the rats opposite . Mr. T. urged his dog on by making snarling and growling noises himself . " Let 's see them , " Mr. T. said . The assistant opened the cage and reached in to grab the rats with his bare hand . This was important , for it proved52 PREPARATIONS The Destruction of Vermin 53that the rats were indeed country animals , and not infected with any disease . The assistant picked out " twenty of the finest " and tossed them down into the pit . The animals scampered around the perimeter , then finally huddled together in one corner , in a furry mass . " Are we ready ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Ready , " said Mr. T. , making growling and snarling sounds to his dog . " Blow on ' em ! Blow on ' em ! " came the cry from the spectators , and various otherwise quite dignified gentlemen puffed and blew toward the rats , raising the fur and sending them into a frenzy . " Aaannnddd . . . go ! " shouted Captain Jimmy , and Mr. T. flung his dog into the pit . Immediately , Mr. T. crouched down until his head was just above the wooden rim , and from this position he urged his dog on with shouted instructionsand canine growls . The dog leapt forward into the mass of rats , striking out at them , snapping at the necks like the true and well-blooded sport that he was . In an instant he had killed three or four . The betting spectators screamed and yelled no less than the owner , who never took his eyes from the combat . " That 's it ! " shouted Mr. T. " That 's a dead one , drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's another , drop ' im . Go ! Grrr-rugh ! " The dog moved quickly from one furry body to the next . Then one rat caught hold of his nose and clung tightly ; the dog could not shake the rat free . " Twister ! Twister ! " shrieked the crowd . The dog writhed , got free , and raced after the others . Now there were six rats killed , their bodies lying on the blood-streaked pit floor . " Two minutes past , " called Captain Jimmy . " Hi , Lover , good Lover , " screamed Mr. T. " Go , boy . Grrrrh ! That 's one , now drop ' im . Go , Lover ! " The dog raced around the arena , pursuing its quarry ; thecrowd screamed and pounded the wooden slats to keep ' the animals in a frenzy . At one point Lover had four rats cling- ing to his face and body , and still he kept going , crunching a fifth in his strong jaws . In the midst of all this furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digni- fied bearing who pushed his way through the crowd until he was standing alongside Mr. T. , whose attention remained wholly focused on the dog . " Three minutes , " Captain Jimmy called . There was a groan from several in the crowd . Three minutes gone and only twelve rats dead ; those who had bet on Mr. T. 's fancy were going to lose their money . Mr. T. himself did not seem to hear the time . His eyes never left the dog ; he barked and yelped ; he twisted his body , writhing with the dog he owned ; he snapped his jaws and screamed orders until he was hoarse . " Time ! " shouted Captain Jimmy , waving the stopwatch . The crowd sighed and relaxed . Lover was pulled from the arena ; the three remaining rats were deftly scooped up by the assistants . Thetatting-match was over ; Mr. T. had lost . " Bloody good try , " said the red-bearded man , in consola- tion . The paradoxes inherent in Mr. Edgar Trent 's behavior at the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such surroundings  --  require some explanation . In the first place , a man who was the president of a bank , a devout Christian , and a pillar of the respectable community would never think to associate himself with members of the lower orders . Quite the contrary : Mr. Trent devoted con- siderable time and energy to keeping these people in their proper place , and he did so with the firm and certain knowl- edge that he was helping to maintain good social order . Yet there were a few places in Victorian society where members of all classes mingled freely , and chief among these54 PREPARATIONSwere sporting events  --  the prize ring , the turf , and , of course , the baiting sports . All these activities were either disreputable or flatly illegal , and their supporters , derived from every stratumof society , shared a common interest that permitted them to overlook the breakdown of social convention upon such occasions . And if Mr. Trent saw no incongruity in his presence among the lowest street hawkers and costers , it is also true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of gentlemen , were equally relaxedat these sporting events , laughing and nudging freely men whom they would not dare to touch under ordinary circumstances . Their common interest  --  animal baiting  --  had been a cherishedform of amusement throughout Western Europe since medieval times . But in Victorian England animal sports were dying out rapidly , the victim of legislation and changing public tastes . The baiting of bulls or bears , common at the turn of the century , was now quite rare ; cockfighting was found only in rural centers . In London in 1854 , only three animal sports remained popular , and all concerned dogs . Nearly every foreign observer since Elizabethan times has commented on the affection Englishmen lavish upon their dogs , and it is odd that the very creature most dear to English hearts should be the focus of these flagrantly sadistic " sportingevents . " Of the three dog sports , dogs set against other dogs was considered the highest " art " of animal sports . This sport was sufficiently widespread that many London criminals made a good living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But dogfights were relatively uncommon , since they were ordinarily battles to the death , and a good fighting dog was an expensive article . Even less common was badger-baiting . Here a badger would be chained in an arena , and a dog or two set loose to worry the animal . The badger 's tough hide and sharp biteThe Destruction of Vermin 55made the spectacle particularly tense and highly popular , but a scarcity of badgers limited the sport . Ratting was the most common dog sport , particularly at the mid-century . Although technically illegal , it was conductedfor decades with flagrant disregard for the law . Throughout London there were signs reading , " Rats Wanted " and " Rats Bought and Sold " ; there was , in fact , a minor industry in ratcatching , with its own specialized rules of the trade . Country rats were most prized , for their fightingvigor and their absence of infection . The more common sewer rats , readily identified by their smell , were timid and their bites more likely to infect a valuable fighting dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub with a wellattendedrat pit might buy two thousand rats a week  --  and a good country rat could fetch as much as a shilling  --  it is not surprising that many individuals made a living as ratcatchers . The most famous was " Black Jack " Hanson , who went about in a hearse-like wagon , offering to rid fashionablemansions of pests for absurdly low rates , so long as he could " take the critters live . " There is no good explanation for why Victorians at all levels of society looked away from the sport of ratting , but they were conveniently blind . Most humane writing of the period deplores and condemns cockfighting  --  which was alreadyvery rare  --  without mentioning dog sports at all . Nor is there any indication that reputable gentlemen felt any unease at participating in ratting sports ; for these gentlemen considered themselves " staunch supporters of the destruction of vermin , " and nothing more . One such staunch supporter , Mr. T. , retired to the downstairsrooms of the Queen 's Head pub , which was now virtuallydeserted . Signaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself and some peppermint for his fancy . Mr. T. was in the process of washing his dog 's mouth outwith peppermint  --  to prevent canker  --  when the red-bearded gentleman came down the stairs and said , " May I join you for a glass ? " " By all means , " Mr. T. said , continuing to minister to his dog . Upstairs , the sound of stomping feet and shouting indicated the beginning of another episode of the destruction of vermin . The red-bearded stranger had to shout over the din . " I perceive you are a gentleman of sporting instinct , " he said . " And unlucky , " Mr. T. said , equally loudly . He stroked his dog . " Lover was not at her best this evening . When she is in a state , there is none to match her , but at times she lacks bustle . " Mr. T. sighed regretfully . " Tonight was such a one . " He ran his hands over the dog 's body , probing for deep bites , and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief . " But she came off well enough . My Lover will fight again . " " Indeed , " the red-bearded man said , " and I shall wager upon her again when she does . " Mr. T. showed a trace of concern . " Did you lose ? " " A trifle . Ten guineas , it was nothing . " Mr. T. was a conservative man , and well enough off , but not disposed to think of ten guineas as " a trifle . " He looked again at his drinking companion , noticing the fine cut of his coat and the excellent white silk of his neckcloth . " I am pleased you take it so lightly , " he said . " Permit me to buy you a glass , as a token of your ill fortune . " " Never , " returned the red-bearded man , " for I count it no ill fortune at all . Indeed , I admire a man who may keep a fancy and sport her . I should do so myself , were I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ? " said Mr. T. , signaling to the barman for another round . " Quite , " said the stranger . " Why , only the other day , I was offered a most excellently made dog , close upon a felon , withThe Destruction of Vermin 57 the tastes of a true fighter . I could not make the purchase , for I have no time myself to look after the animal . " " Most unfortunate , " said Mr. T. " What was the price asked ? " " Fifty guineas . " " Excellent price . " " Indeed . " The waiter brought more drinks . " I am myself in search of a made dog , " Mr. T. said . " Indeed ? " " Yes , " Mr. T. said . " I should like a third to complement my stable , with Lover and Shantung  --  that is the other dog . But I do n't suppose . . . " The red-bearded gentleman paused discreetly before an -- swering . The training , buying , and selling of fighting dogs was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pierce said at last , " I could inquire whether the animal is still available . " " Oh , yes ? That would be very good of you . Very good indeed . " Mr. T. had a sudden thought . " But were I you , , I should buy it myself . After all , while you were abroad , your wife could instruct the servants in the care of the beast . " " I fear , " replied the red-bearded man , " that I have devoted too much of my energies these past years to the pursuit of business concerns . I have never married . " And then he added , " But of course I should like to . " " Of course , " Mr. T. said , with a most peculiar look comingover his face . CHAPTER 12The Problem of Miss Elizabeth TrentVictorian England was the first society to constantly gather statistics on itself , and generally these figures were a source of unabashed pride . Beginning in 1840 , however , one trend worriedthe leading thinkers of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By.1251 , the number of single women of marriageable age was reliably put at 2,765,000  --  and a large proportion of these women were the daughters of the middle and upper classes . Here was a problem of considerable dimension and gravity . Women of lower stations in life could take jobs as seamstresses , flower girls , field workers , or any of a dozen lowly occupations . These women were of no pressing concern ; they were slovenly creatures lacking in education and a discriminatingview of the world . A. H. White reports , in tones of astonishment , that he interviewed a young girl who worked as a matchbox maker , who " never went to church or chapel . Never heard of England ' or London ' or the sea ' or ships . ' Never heard of God . Does not know what He does . Does not know whether it is better to be good or bad . " Obviously , in the face of such massive ignorance , one must simply be grateful that the poor child had discovered some way to survive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters of middle- and upper-class households wasThe Problem of Miss Elizabeth Trent 59different . These young ladies possessed education and a taste for genteel living . And they had been raised from birth for no other purpose than to be " perfect wives . " It was terribly important that such women should marry . The failure to marry  --  spinsterhood  --  implied a kind of dreadfulcrippling , for it was universally acknowledged that " a woman 's true position was that of administratrix , mainspring , guiding star of the home , " and if she was unable to perform this function , she became a sort of pitiful social misfit , an oddity . The problem was made more acute by the fact that wellbornwomen had few alternatives to wifehood . After all , as one contemporary observer noted , what occupations could they find " without losing their position in society ? A lady , to be such , must be a mere lady , and nothing else . She must not work for profit , or engage in any occupation that money can command , lest she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their labor .... " In practice , an unmarried upper-class woman could use the one unique attribute of her position , education , and becomea governess . But by 1851 , twenty-five thousand women were already employed as governesses and there was , to say the least , no need for more . Her other choices were much less appealing : she might be a shop assistant , a clerk , a telegraphist , or a nurse , but all these occupations were more suitable for an ambitious lower-class woman than a firmly established gentlewoman of quality . If a young woman refused such demeaning work , her spinsterhood implied a considerable financial burden upon the household . Miss Emily Downing observed that " the daughtersof professional men . . . can not but feel themselves a burden and a drag on the hard-won earnings of their fathers ; they must know  --  if they allow themselves to think at all  --  that they are a constant cause of anxiety , and that should they not get married , there is every probability of their being , sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfitted for the fight . " In short , there was intense pressure for marriage  --  any sort of decent marriage  --  felt by fathers and daughters alike . The Victorians tended to marry relatively late , in their twenties or thirties , but Mr. Edgar 7 rent had a daughter Elizabeth , now twenty-nine and of " wholly marriageable condition "  --  meaning somewhat past her prime . It could not have escaped Mr. Trent 's attention that the red-bearded gentleman might be in need of a wife . The gentleman himselfexpressed no reluctance to marry , but rather had indicatedthat the exigencies ' of business had kept him from pursuing personal happiness . Thus there was no reason to believe that this well-dressed , evidently well-to-do young man with a sporting instinct might not be drawn to Elizabeth . ' With this in mind , Mr. Trent contrived to invite Mr. Pierce to his house on Highwater Road for Sunday tea , on the pretextof discussing the purchase of a fighting dog from Mr. Pierce . Mr. Pierce , somewhat reluctantly , accepted the invitation . Elizabeth Trent was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of deference to her finer sensibilities . But popular accounts of the time give us an accurate picture of her . She was of medium height , rather darker in complexionthan was the fashion , and her features were , in the words of one observer , " regular enough without being what one might call pretty . " Then , as now , journalists were inclined to exaggerate the beauty of any woman involved in a scandalous event , so that the absence of compliments about Miss Trent 's appearance probably implies " an unfortunate aspect . " She apparently had few suitors , save for those openly ambitious fellows eager to marry a bank president 's daughter , and these she staunchly rejected , with her father 's undoubtedlymixed blessing . But she must surely have been impressed with Pierce , that " dashing , intrepid , fine figure of a man with charm to burn . " By all accounts , Pierce was equally impressed by the young lady . A servant 's testimony records their initial meeting , which reads as if it came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea on the rear lawn with Mr. Trent and Mrs. Trent , an " acknowledged beauty of the town . " They watched as bricklayers in the back yard patientlyerected a ruined building , while nearby a gardener planted picturesque weeds . This was the last gasp of a nearly one-hundred-year English fascination with ruins ; they were still so fashionable that everyone who could afford a decent ruin installed one on his grounds . Pierce watched the workmen for a while . " What is it to be ? " he inquired . " We thought a water mill , " Mrs. Trent said . " It will be so delightful , especially if there is the rusted curve of the waterwheel itself . Do n't you think so ? " " We are building the rusted wheel at a goodly expense , " Mr. Trent grumbled . " It is being constructed of previously rusted metal , saving us a good deal of bother , " Mrs. Trent added . " But of course we must wait for the weeds to grow up around the site before it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , wearing white crinoline . " Ah , my darling daughter , " Mr. Trent said , rising , and Mr. Pierce rose with him . " May I present Mr. Edward Pierce , my daughter Elizabeth . " " I confess I did not know you had a daughter , " Pierce said . He bowed deeply at the waist , took her hand , and seemed about to kiss it but hesitated . He appeared greatly flustered by the young woman 's arrival on the scene . " Miss Trent , " he said , releasing her hand awkwardly . " You take me quite by surprise . " 6z PREPARAIIONS " I can not tell if that is to my advantage or no , " Elizabeth Trent replied , quickly taking a seat at the tea table and holding out her hand until a filled cup was put in it . " I assure you , it is wholly to your advantage , " Mr. Pierce replied . And he was reported to have colored deeply at this remark . Miss Trent fanned herself ; Mr. Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up a tray of biscuits and said , " Will you try one of these , Mr. Pierce ? " " With gratitude , Madam , " Mr. Pierce replied , and no one present doubted the sincerity of his words . " We are just discussing the ruins , " Mr. Trent said , in a somewhat overloud voice . " But prior to that Mr. Pierce was telling us of his travels abroad . He has recently returned from New York , in point of fact . " It was a cue ; his daughter picked it up neatly . " Really ? " she said , fanning herself briskly . " How utterly fascinating . " " I fear it is more so in the prospect than the telling , " Mr. Pierce replied , avoiding the glance of the young woman to such a degree that all observed his abashed reticence . He was clearly taken with her ; and the final proof was that he ad- dressed his remarks to Mrs. Trent . " It is a city like any other in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of niceties which we residents of London take for granted . " " I have been informed , " Miss Trent ventured , still fanning , " that there are native predators in the region . " " I should be delighted if I could regale you , " Mr. Pierce said , " with endless adventures with the Indians  --  for so they are called , in America as in the East  --  but I fear I have no ad- ventures to report . The wilderness of America does not begin until the Mississippi is crossed . " " Have you done so ? " asked Mrs. Trent . " I have , " Mr. Pierce replied . " It is a vast river , many times more broad than the Thames , and it marks the boundary in America between civilization and savagery . Although lately they are constructing a railway across that vast colony "  --  he permitted himself the condescending reference to America , and Mr. Trent guffawed  --  " and I expect with the coming of the railway , the savagery will soon vanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently unable to think of anything else to say . " What business took you to New York ? " Mr. Trent asked . " If I may be so bold , " Mr. Pierce continued , ignoring the question , " and if the delicate ears of the ladies present shall not be offended , I shall give an example of the savagery which persists in the American lands , and the rude way of life which many persons there think nothing remarkable . Do you know of buffaloes ? " " I have read of them , " said Mrs. Trent , her eyes flashing . According to some of the testimony of the servants , she was as taken with Mr. Pierce as was her stepdaughter , and her demeanor created a minor scandal within the Trent household . Mrs. Trent said , " These buffaloes are large beasts , like wild cows , and shaggy . " " Precisely so , " Mr. Pierce said . " The western portion of the American country is widely populated with these buffalo creatures , and many persons make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Have you been to California , where there is gold ? " asked Miss Trent abruptly . " Yes , " Pierce said . " Let the man finish his tale , " Mrs. Trent said , rather too sharply . " Well , " Pierce said , " the buffalo hunters , as they are known , sometimes seek the flesh of the animals , which is reckoned like venison , and sometimes the hide , which also has value . " " They lack tusks , " Mr. Trent said . Mr. Trent had lately financed an elephant-killing expedition on behalf of the bank , and at this very moment an enormous warehouse at dockside64 PREPARATIONS j The Problem of Miss Elizabeth Trent 65was filled with five thousand ivory tusks . Mr. Trent had gone to inspect these goods for himself , a vast room of white curving tusks , most impressive . " No , they have no tusks , although the male of the species possesses horns . " " Horns , I see . But not of ivory . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please go on , " Mrs. Trent said , her eyes still flashing . " Well , " Pierce said , " the men who ki  --  who dispatch these buffaloes are called buffalo hunters , and they utilize rifles for their purposes . On occasion they organize themselves into a line to drive the beasts over some cliff in a mass . But that is not common . Most frequently , the beast is dispatched singly . In any event  --  and here I must beg excuses for the crudity of what I must report of this crude countryside  --  once the beast has terminated existence , its innards are re-moved . " " Very sensible , " Mr. Trent said . " To be sure , " Pierce said , " but here is the peculiar part . These buffalo hunters prize as the greatest of delicacies one portion of the innards , that being the small intestines of the beast . " " How are they prepared ? " Miss Trent asked . " By roastingover a fire , I expect . " " No , Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a tale of abject savagery . These intestines which are so prized , so much considered a delicacy , are consumed upon the spot , in a state wholly uncooked . " " Do you mean raw ? " asked Mrs. Trent , wrinkling her nose . " Indeed , Madam , as we would consume a raw oyster , so do the hunters consume the intestine , and that while it is still warm from the newly expired beast . " " Dear God , " said Mrs. Trent . " Now , then , " Pierce continued , " it happens upon occasionthat two men may have joined in the killing , and immediately afterward each falls upon one end of the prized intestines . Each hunter races the other , trying to gobble up this delicacyfaster than his opponent . " " Gracious , " Miss Trent said , fanning herself more briskly . " Not only that , " Pierce said , " but in their greedy haste , the buffalo hunter often swallows the portions whole . This is a known trick . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating pull from the other the undigestedportion straightaway from his mouth , as I might pull a string through my fingers . And thus one man may gobble up what another has earlier eaten , in a manner of speaking . " " Oh , dear , " said Mrs. Trent , turning quite pale . Mr. Trent cleared his throat . " Remarkable . " " How quaint , " said Miss Trent bravely , with a quivering voice . " You really must excuse me , " said Mrs. Trent , rising . " My dear , " Mr. Trent said . " Madam , I hope I have not distressed you , " said Mr. Pierce , also rising . " Your tales are quite remarkable , " Mrs. Trent said , turning to leave . " My dear , " Mr. Trent said again , and hastened after her . Thus Mr. Edward Pierce and Miss Elizabeth Trent were briefly alone on the back lawn of the mansion , and they were seen to exchange a few words . The content of their conversationis not known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Mr. Pierce " quite fascinating in a rough-and-ready way , " and it was generally agreed in the Trent household that young Elizabeth was now in possession of that most valuable of all acquisitions , a " prospect . " CHAPTER 13A Hanging1l r . The. -. execution of the notorious axe , murderess Emma Barnes on August 28 , 1854 , was a well-publicized affair . On the evening prior to the execution , the first of the crowds began to gather outside the high granite walls of Newgate Prison , where they would spend the night in order to be assured of a good view of the spectacle the following morning . That same evening , the gallows was brought out and assembled by the executioner 's assistants . The sound of hammering would continue long into the night . The owners of nearby rooming houses that overlooked Newgate square were pleased to rent their rooms for the evening to the better class of ladies and gents eager to get a room with a good view over the site for a " hanging party . " Mrs. Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of her rooms , and when a well-spoken gentleman named Pierce asked to hire the best of them for the night , she struck a hard bargain : twenty-five guineas for a single evening . That was a considerable sum of money . Mrs. Molloy could live comfortably for a year on that amount , but she did not let the fact influence her , for she knew what it was worth to Mr. Pierce himself  --  the cost of a butler for six months , or the price of one or two good ladies ' dresses , and nothing more substantial than that . The very proof of his indifference lay in the ready way he paid her , on the spot , in gold guineas . Mrs. Molloy did not wish to risk offending him by biting the coins in front of him , but she would bite them as soonA Hanging 67as she was alone . One could n't be too careful with gold guineas , and she had been fooled more than once , even by gentlemen . The coins were genuine , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in the day , Mr. Pierce and his party filed upstairs to the hired room . The party con- sisted of two other men and two women , all smartly turned out in good clothes . She could tell by their accents that the men were not gentlemen , and the women were no better than they looked , despite the wicker baskets and bottles of wine they carried . When the party entered the room and closed the door be- hind them , she did not bother to listen at the keyhole . She 'd have no trouble from them , she was sure of it . Pierce stepped to the window and looked down at the crowd , which gathered size with each passing minute . The square was dark , lit only by the glare of torches around the scaffolding ; by that hot , baleful light he could see the cross- bar and trap taking shape . " Never make it , " Agar said behind him . Pierce turned . " He has to make it , laddie . " " He 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard speak of , but he ca n't get out of there , " Agar said , jerking his thumb toward Newgate Prison . The second man now spoke . The second man was Barlotiv , a stocky , rugged man with a white knife scar across his fore- head , which he usually concealed beneath the brim of his hat . Barlow was a reformed buzzer turned rampsman  --  a pickpocket who had degenerated to plain mugging  --  whom Pierce had hired , some years back , as a buck cabby . All rampsman were thugs at heart , and that was precisely what a cracksman like Pierce wanted for a buck cabby , a man hold- ing the reins to the cab , ready to make the getaway  --  or ready for a bit of a shindy , if it came to that . And Barlow was loyal ; he had worked for Pierce for nearly five years now. 68 PREPARATIONS Barlow frowned and said , " If it can be done , he 'll do it . Clean Willy can do it if it can be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who formed his thoughts with slowness . Pierce knew he could be quick in action , how- ever . Pierce looked at the women . They were the mistresses of Agar and Barlow , which meant they were also their ac- complices . He did not know their names and he did not want to know . He regretted the very idea that they must be present at this occasion  --  in five years , he had never seen Barlow 's woman  --  but there was no way to avoid it . Bar- low 's woman was an obvious soak ; you could smell the gin breath across the room . Agar 's woman was little better , but at least she was sober . " Did you bring the trimmings ? " Pierce asked . Agar 's woman opened a picnic basket . In it , he saw a sponge , medicinal powders , and bandages . There was also a carefully folded dress . " All I was told , sir . " " The dress is small ? " " Aye , sir . Barely more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " Pierce said , and turned back to look at the square once more . He paid no attention to the gallows or the swelling crowd . Instead he stared at the walls of Newgate Prison . " Here 's the supper , sir , " said Barlow 's woman . Pierce looked back at the supplies of cold fowl , jars of pickled onion , lobster claws , and a packet of dark cigars . " Very good , very good , " he said . Agar said , " Are you playing the noble , sir ? " This was a reference to a well-known magsman 's con . It was said sar- castically , and Agar later testified that Pierce did n't care for the comment . He turned back with his long coat open at the waist to reveal a revolver jammed into the waistband of his trousers . " If any of you steps aside , " he said , " you 'll have a barker up your nose , and I 'll see you in lavender . " He smiled thinly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . " " No offense , " Agar said , looking at the gun . " No offense at all , no offense  --  it was only in the manner of a joke . " Barlow said , " Why 'd we need a snakesman ? " Pierce was not sidetracked . " Bear my words carefully , " he said . " Any of you steps aside and you 'll stop a shot before you can say Jack Robin . I mean every word . " He sat down at the table . " Now then , " he said , " I 'll have a leg of that chicken , and we shall disport ourselves as best we can while we wait . " Pierce slept part of the night ; he was awakened at daybreak by the crowd that jammed the square below . The crowd had now swollen to more than fifteen thousand noisy , rough people , and Pierce knew that the streets would be filled with ten or fifteen thousand more , making their way to see the hanging on their route to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictness on any Monday morning when there was a hanging ; it was an accepted fact that everybody would be late to work , and especially today , with a woman to be hanged . The gallows itself was now finished ; the rope dangled in the air above the trap . Pierce glanced at his pocketwatch . It was 7:45 , just a short time before the execution itself . In the square below , the crowd began to chant : " Oh , my , think I 'm going to die ! Oh , my , think I 'm going to die ! " There was a good deal of laughter and shouting and stamping of feet . One or two fights broke out , but they could not be sustained in the tightly packed crush of the crowd . They all went to the window to watch . Agar said , " When do you think he 'll make his move ? " " Right at eight , I should think . " " I 'd do it a bit sooner , myself . " Pierce said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The minutes passed slowly . No one in the room spoke. 70 PREPARATIONS A Hanging 71moment of utter silence , and then the excited roar of discussion . Pierce knew that most of the crowd would remain in the square , watching for the next hour , until the dead woman was cut down and placed in a coffin . " Will you take some punch ? " asked Agar 's tart . " No , " Pierce said . And then he said , " Where is Willy ? " Clean Williame the most famous snakesman of the century , was Inst e ewgate Prison beginning his escape . He was a tiny man , and he had been famous in his youth for his agility as achimney sweep 's apprentice ; in later years he had been employed by the most eminent cracksmen , and his feats were now legendary . It was said that Clean Willy could climb a surface of glass , and no one was quite certain that he could n't . Certainly the guards of Newgate , knowing the celebrity of their prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , just in case . Yet they also knew that escape from Newgate was flatly impossible . A resourceful man might make a go of it from Ponsdale , where routines were notoriouslylax , the walls low , and the guards not averse to the feel of gold coin and were known to look the other way . Ponsdale , or Highgate , or any of a dozen others , but never Newgate . Tewgate Prison was the most secure in all England . It had been designed by . George Dance , " one of the most meticulous intellects of the Age of Taste , " and-every detail of the buildinghad been set forth to emphasize the has , facts of confinement . Thus the proportions of the window arches had been " subtly thickened in order to intensify the painful narrownessof the openings , " and contemporary observers applauded the excellence of such cruel effects . The reputation of Newgate was not merely a matter of aesthetics .

The stones were soFinally , Barlow said , " I knew Emma Barnes  --  never thought she 'd come to this . " Pierce said nothing . At eight o'clock , the chimes of St. Sepulchre signaled the hour , and the crowd roared in anticipation . There was the soft jingle of a prison bell , and then a door in Newgate opened and the prisoner was led out , her wrists strapped behind her . In front was a chaplain , reciting from the Bible . Behind was the city executioner , dressed in black . The crowd saw the prisoner and shouted " Hats off ! " Every man 's hat was removed as the prisoner slowly stepped up the scaffolding . Then there were cries of " Down in front ! Down in front ! " They were , for the most part , unheeded . Pierce kept his gaze on the condemned woman . Emma Barnes was in her thirties , and looked vigorous enough . The firm lines and muscles of her neck were clearly visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glazed ; she did not really seem to see anything . She took up her positionand the city executioner turned to her , making slight adjustments , as if he were a seamstress positioning a dressmaker'sdummy . Emma Barnes stared above the crowd . The rope was fitted to a chain around her neck . The clergyman read loudly , keeping his eyes fixed on the Bible . The city executioner strapped the woman 's legs together with a leather strap ; this occasioned a good deal of fumbling beneath her skirts ; the crowd made raucous comments . Then the executioner stood , and slipped a black hood over the woman 's head . And then , at a signal , the trap opened with a wooden crack ! that Pierce heard with startling distinctness ; and the body fell , and caught , and hung instantly motionless . " He 's getting better at it , " Agar said . The city executioner was known for botching executions , leaving the hanged prisonerto writhe and dangle for several minutes before he died . " Crowd wo n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not seem to mind . There was a7 2 PREPARATIONSfinely cut that they were said to be impossible to scale . Yet even if one could manage the impossible , it was to no avail , for encircling the top of the walls was an iron bar , fitted with revolving , razor-sharp spiked drums . And the bar was also fitted with spikes . No man could get past that obstacle . Escape from Newgate was inconceivable . With the passing months , as the guards grew familiar with the presence of little Willy , they ceased to watch him closely . He was not a difficult prisoner . He never broke the rule of silence , never spoke to a fellow inmate ; he suffered the " cockchafer "  --  ortreadmill  --  for the prescribed fifteen-minute intervalswithout complaint or incident ; he worked at oakumpickingwith no surcease . Indeed , there was some grudging respect for the reformed aspect of the little man , for the cheerfulway he went about the routine . He was a likely candidate for a ticket-of-leave , a foreshortened sentence , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning on that Monday , August 28 , 1854 , Clean Willy Williams had slipped to a corner of the prison where two walls met , and with his back to the angle he was skinning straight up the sheer rock surface , bracing with his hands and feet . He dimly heard the chanting of the crowd : " Oh , my , think I 'm going to die ! " as he reached the top of the wall , and without hesitation grabbed the bar with its iron spikes . His hands were immediately lacerated . From childhood , Clean Willy had had no sensation in his palms , which were thickly covered with calluses and scar tissue . It was the custom of homeowners of the period to keep a hearth burning right to the moment when the chimney sweep and his child assistant arrived to clean the flue , and if the child scorched his hands in hastening up the still-hot chimney , that was not any great concern . If the child did n't like the work , there were plenty of others to take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again , over a period of years . So he felt nothing now as the blood trickled down from his slashed palms , ran in rivulets alongA Hanging 73his forearms , and dripped and spattered on his face . He paid no attention at all . He moved slowly along the revolving spike wheels , down the full length of one wall , then to the second wall , and then to the third . It was exhausting work . He lost all sense of time , and never heard the noise of the crowd that followed the execution . He continued to make his way around the perim- eter of the prison yard until he reached the south wall . There he paused and waited while a patrolling guard passed beneath him . The guard never looked up , although Willy later re- membered that drops of his own blood landed on the man 's cap and shoulders . When the guard was gone , Willy clambered over the spikes  --  cutting his chest , his knees , and his legs , so that the blood now ran very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nearest building outside the prison . No one heard the sound of his landing , for the area was deserted ; everybody was attending the execution . From that roof he jumped to another , and then another , leaping six- and eight-foot gaps without hesitation . Once or twice , he lost his grip on the shingles and slates of the roofs , but he always recovered . He had , after all , spent much of his life on rooftops . Finally , less than half an hour from the time he began to inch his way up the prison wall , he slipped through a gabled window at the back of Mrs. Molloy 's lodging house , padded down the hallway , and entered the room rented , at consid- erable expense , by Mr. Pierce and his party . Agar recalled that Willy presented " a ghastly aspect , most fearsome , " and he added that " he was bleeding like a stuck saint , " although this blasphemous reference was expunged from the courtroom records . Pierce directed the swift treatment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vapors of ammo-74 PREPARATIONSnium chloride from a cut-glass inhaler . His clothes were stripped off by the women , who pretended no modesty but worked quickly ; his many wounds were staunched with stypticpowder and sticking plaster , then bound with surgical bandages . Agar gave him a sip of coca wine for energy , and Burroughs &; Wellcome beef-and-iron wine for sustenance . He was forced to down two Carter 's Little Nerve Pills and some tincture of opium for his pain . This combined treatmentbrought the man to his senses , and enabled the women to clean his face , douse his body with rose water , and bundle him into the waiting dress . When he was dressed , he was given a sip of Bromo Caffein for further energy , and told to act faint . A bonnet was placed over his head , and boots laced on his feet ; his bloody prison garb was stuffed in the picnic basket . No one among the crowd of more than twenty thousand paid the slightest attention when the well-dressed party of hangers-on departed Mrs. Molloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so faint that she had to be carried by the men , who hustled her into a waiting cab  --  and rattled off into the morning light . A faint woman was a common enough sight and , in any case , nothing to compare to a woman turning slowly at the end of the rope , back and forth , back and forth . CHAPTER 14A Georgian DisgraceIt is usually estimated that seven-eighths of the structures in Victorian London were actually Georgian . The face of the city and its general architectural character were legacies of that earlier era ; the Victorians did not begin to rebuild their capital in any substantial way until the z 88os . This reluctance reflected the economics of urban . building . For most of the century , it simply was not profitable to tear down old struc- tures , even those badly suited to their modern functions . Certainly the reluctance was not aesthetic  --  the Victorians loathed the Georgian style , which Ruskin himself termed " the ne plus ultra of ugliness . " Thus it is perhaps not surprising that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Newgate Prison , observed that " the virtues of this edifice have been clearly overstated . Not only is escape from its confines possible , it is mere child 's play , for the fleeing villain had not yet attained his majority . It is time for this public disgrace to be torn down . " The article went on to comment that " the Metropolitan Police has dispatched groups of armed officers into the rook- eries of the town , in order to flush out the escaped man , and there is every expectation of his apprehension . " There were no follow-up reports . One must remember that during this period , jailbreaks were , in the words of one com- mentator , " quite as common as illegitimate births , " and noth- ing so ordinary was really newsworthy . At a time when the curtains of the windows of Parliament were being soaked in76 PREPARATIONS The Pierce Household 77lime to - protect. the members against the cholera epidemic ' Tide they debated the conduct of the Crimean campaign , the newspapers could not be bothered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make a clean getaway . A month later , the body of a young man was found floating in the Thames , and police authorities identified him as the escaped convict from Newgate . It received barely a paragraphin the Evening Standard ; the other newspapers did not mention it at all . CHAPTER 15The Pierce HouseholdAfter his escape , Clean Willy was taken to Pierce 's house in Mayfair , where he spent several weeks in seclusion while his wounds healed . It is from his later testimony to police that we first learn of the mysterious woman who was Pierce 's mistress , and known to Willy as eiMiss Miriam .  --  Willy was placed in an upstairs room , and the servants were told that he was a relative of Miss Miriam 's who had been run down by a cab on New Bond Street . From time to time , Willy was tended by Miss Miriam . He said of her that she was " well carried , a good figure , and well-spoke , and she walked here and there slow , never hurrying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were impressed by the ethereal aspect of the young woman ; her eyes were said to be especially captivating , and her grace in movement was called " dreamlike " and " phantasmagorical . " Apparently this woman lived in the house with Pierce , although she was often gone during the day . Clean Willy was never very clear about her movements , and in any case he was often sedated with opium , which may also account for the ghostly qualities he saw in her . Willy recalled only one conversation with her . He asked , " Are you his canary , then ? " Meaning was she Pierce 's accomplicein burglary . " Oh no , " she said , smiling . " I have no ear for music . " From this he assumed she was not involved in Pierce 's plans , although this was later shown to be wrong . She was an integral part of the plan , and was probably the first of the thieves to know Pierce 's intentions . At the trial , there was considerable speculation about Miss Miriam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that she was an actress . This would explain her ability to mimic various accents and manners of different social classes ; her tendency to wear make-up in a day when no respectablewoman would let cosmetics touch her flesh ; and her open presence as Pierce 's mistress . In those days , the dividingline between an actress and a prostitute was exceedingly fine . And actors were by occupation itinerant wanderers , likely to have connections with criminals , or to be criminals themselves . Whatever the truth of her past , she seems to have been his mistress for several years . Pierce himself was rarely in the house , and on occasion he was gone overnight . Clean Willy recalled seeing him once or twice in the late afternoon , wearing riding clothes and smellingof horses , as if he had returned from an equestrian excursion . " I did n't know you were a horse fancier , " Willy once said . " I 'm not , " Pierce replied shortly . " Hate the bloody beasts . " Pierce kept Willy indoors after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to grow out . In those days , thesurest way to identify an escaped convict was by his shorthaircut . By late September , his hair was longer , but still Piercedid not allow him to Ieave . When Willy asked why , Pierce78 PREPARATIONSsaid , " I am waiting for you to be recaptured , or found dead . " This statement puzzled Willy , but he did as he was told . A few days later , Pierce came in with a newspaper under his arm and told him he could leave . That same evening Willy went to the Holy Land , where he expected to find his mistress , Maggie . He found that Maggie had taken up with a footpad , a rough sort who made his way by " swinging the stick "  --  that is , by mugging . Maggie showed no interest in Willy . Willy then took up with a girl of twelve named Louise , whose principal occupation was snowing . She was described in court as " no gofferer , mind , and no clean-starcher , just a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple , really . " What was meant by this passage , which required considerableexplanation to the presiding magistrates , was that Willy 's new mistress was engaged in the lowest form of laundrystealing . The better echelons of laundry stealers , the gofferersand clean-starchers , stole from high-class districts , often taking clothes off the lines . Plain ordinary snowing was relegated to children and young girls , and it could be lucrative enough when fenced to " translators , " who sold the clothing as second-hand goods . Willy lived off this girl 's earnings , never venturing outside the sanctuary of the rookery . He had been warned by Pierce to keep his mouth shut , and he never mentioned that he had had help in his break from Newgate . Clean Willy lived with his Judy in a lodging house that contained more than a hundredpeople ; the house was a well-known buzzer 's lurk .

" CHAPTER 16Rotten RowOf all. the fashionable sections of that fashionable city of London , none compared to the spongy , muddy pay hway in Hyde Park called the Ladies ' Mile , or Rotten Row . Here , weather permitting , were literally hundreds of men and women on horseback , all dressed in the greatest splendor the age could provide , radiant in the golden sunshine at four in the afternoon . It was a scene of bustling activity : the horsemen and horsewomenpacked tightly together ; the women with little uniformedfoot pages trotting along behind their mistresses , or sometimes accompanied by stern , mounted duennas , or sometimesescorted by their beaus . And if the spectacle of Rotten Row was splendid and fashionable , it was not entirely respectable , for many of the women were of dubious character . " There is no difficulty , " wrote one observer , " in guessing the occupation of the dashing equestrienne who salutes half-adozenmen at once with whip or with a wink , and who sometimesvaries the monotony of a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swerving over to listen to the compliments of a walking admirer . " These were members of the highest class of prostitute and , like it or not , respectable ladies often found themselves competing with these smartly turned-out demimondes for masculineattention . Nor was this the only arena of such competition ; it occurred at the opera , and the theatre as well . More than one young lady found that her escort 's gaze was fixed8o PREPARATIONS not on the performance but on some high box where an ele- gant woman returned his glances with open , frank interest . Victorians claimed to be scandalized by the intrusion of prostitutes into respectable circles , but despite all the calls for reform and change , the women continued to appear gaily for nearly a half-century more . It is usual to dismiss Victorian prostitution as a particularly gaudy manifestation of that so- ciety 's profound hypocrisy . But the issue is really more coin- plex ; it has to do with the way that women were viewed in Victorian England . This was an era of marked sexual differentiation in dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture and rooms within the house were viewed as " masculine " or " femi- nine " ; the dining room was masculine , the drawing room feminine , and so on . All this was assumed to have a biological rationale : " It is evident , " wrote Alexander Walker , " that the man , possessing reasoning faculties , muscular power , and courage to employ it , is qualified for being a protector ; the woman , being little capable of reasoning , feeble , and timid , requires protecting . Under such circumstances , the man naturally governs : the woman naturally obeys . " With minor variations , this belief was repeated again and again . The power of reasoning was small in women ; they did not calculate consequences ; they were governed by their emo- tions , and hence required strict controls on their behavior by the more rational and levelheaded male . The presumed intellectual inferiority of the female was reinforced by her education , and many well-bred women probably were the simpering , tittering , pathologically delicate fools that populate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share much with their wives . Mandell Creighton wrote that he found " ladies in general very unsatisfactory mental food ; they seem to have no particular thoughts or ideas , and though for a time it is flattering to one 's vanity to think one may teach them some , it palls after a while . Of course at a certain age , when you have a house and so on , you get a wife as part of its furniture , and find her a very comfortable institution ; but I doubt greatly whether there were ever many men who had thoughts worth recounting , who told these thoughts to their wives at first , or who expectedthem to appreciate them . " There is good evidence that both sexes were bored silly by this arrangement . Women , stranded in their vast , servantfilledhouseholds , dealt with their frustrations in spectacular displays of hysterical neurosis : they suffered loss of hearing , speech , and sight ; they had choking fits , fainting spells , loss of appetite , and even loss of memory . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhe in such arcing spasms that their heads would touch their heels . All these bizarre symptoms , of course , only reinforced the general notion of the frailty of the female sex . Frustrated men had another option , and that was recourse to prostitutes , who were often lively , gay , witty  --  indeed , all the things it was inconceivable for a woman to be . On a simpler level , men found prostitutes agreeable because they could , in their company , discard the strained formalities of polite society and relax in an atmosphere of " unbuttoned easiness . " This freedom from restraints was at least as importantas the availability of sexual outlets per se , and it is probablythis appeal that gave the institution such a broad base within society and allowed prostitutes to intrude boldly into acceptable arenas of Victorian society , such as Rotten Row . Beginning in late September , 1854 , Edward Pierce began to meet Miss Elizabeth Trent on riding excursions in Rotten Row . The first encounter was apparently accidental but later , by a sort of unstated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life began to form itself around these afternoon meetings : she spent all morning preparing for them , and all evening discussing them ; her friends complained that she talked incessantly of Edward ; her father complained of his daughter 's insatiable demand for new dresses . She seemed , 82 PREPARATIONS he said , " to require as a necessity a new garment every day , and she would prefer two . " The unattractive young woman apparently , never thought it strange that Mr. Pierce should single her out from among the throng of stunning beauties on Rotten Row ; she was completely captivated by his attentions . At the trial , Pierce summarized their conversations as " light and trivial , " and recounted only one in detail . This occurred sometime in the month of October , 1854 . It was a time of political upheaval and military scandal ; the nation had suffered a severe blow to its self-esteem . The Crimean War was turning into a disaster . When it began , J. B. Priestley notes , " the upper classes welcomed the war as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was almost as if the Black Sea had been opened to tourism . Wealthy officers like Lord Cardigan decided to take their yachts . Sonic commanders ' wives insisted upon going along , accompanied by their personal maids . Various civilians cancelled their holidays elsewhere to follow the army and see the sport . " The sport quickly became a debacle . The British troops were badly trained , badly supplied , and ineptly led . Lord Raglan , the military commander , was sixty-five and " old for his age . " Raglan often seemed to think he was still fighting Waterloo , and referred to the enemy as " the French , " al- though the French were now his allies . On one occasion he was so confused that he took up an observation post behind the Russian enemy lines . The atmosphere of " aged chaos " deepened , and by the middle of the summer even the wives of officers were writing home to say that " nobody appears to have the least idea what they are about . " By October , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigade , a spectacular feat of heroism which decimated three-quarters of his forces in a successful effort to capture the wrong battery of enemy guns . Clearly the picnic was over , and nearly all upper-class Englishmen were profoundly concerned . The names of Cardigan , Raglan , and Lucan were on everyone 's lips . But on that warm October afternoon in Hyde Park , Mr. Pierce gently guided Elizabeth Trent into a conversation about her father . " He was most fearfully nervous this morning , " she said . " Indeed ? " Pierce said , trotting alongside her . " He is nervous every morning when he must send the gold shipments to the Crimea . He is a different man from the very moment he arises . He is distant and preoccupied in the ex-treme . " " I am certain he bears a heavy responsibility , " Pierce said . " So heavy , I fear he may take to excessive drink , " Elizabethsaid , and laughed a little . " I pray you exaggerate , Madam . " " Well , he acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely opposed to the consumption of any alcohol before nightfall . " " I do , and most sensible , too . " " Well , " Elizabeth Trent continued , " I suspect him of breaking his own regulation , for each morning of the shipmentshe goes alone to the wine cellar , with no servants to accompany him or to hold the gas lanterns . He is insistent upon going alone . Many times my stepmother has chided him that he may stumble or suffer some misfortune on the steps to the basement . But he will have none of her entreaties . And he spends some time in the cellar , and then emerges , and makes his journey to the bank . " " I think , " Pierce said , " that he merely checks the cellar for some ordinary purpose . Is that not logical ? " " No , indeed , " Elizabeth said , " for at all times he relies upon my stepmother to deal in the stocking and care of the cellar , and the decanting of wines before dinners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most peculiar . I trust , " Pierce said gravely , " that his responsibilities are not placing an overgreat burden upon his nervous system . " 84 PREPARATIONS " I trust , " the daughter answered , with a sigh . " Is it not a lovely day ? " " Lovely , " Pierce agreed . " Unspeakably lovely , but no more lovely than you . " Elizabeth Trent tittered , and replied that he was a bold rogue to flatter her so openly . " One might even suspect an ulterior motive , " she said , laughing . " Heavens , no , " Pierce said , and to further reassure her he placed his hand lightly , and briefly , over hers . " I am so happy , " she said . " And I am happy with you , " Pierce said , and this was true , for he now knew the location of all f. , ourkeys . E. A R T I INovember , 1854-February , 1855CHAPTER 1 7The Necessity of a FreshMr . Henry Fowler , seated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed every sign of agitation . He bit his lip , he twisted his glass in his hands , and he could hardly bring himself to look into the eyes of his friend Edward Pierce . " I do not know how to begin , " he said .

" You see , it is "  --  he broke off , and shook his head  --  " most dreadfully embarrassing . " " Then speak of it forthrightly , " Pierce advised , " as one man to another . " Fowler gulped his drink , and set the glass back on the table with a sharp clink . " Very well . Plainly , the long and the short of it is that I have the French malady . " " Oh , dear , " Pierce said . " I fear I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must pay the price . It is altogether most wretched and vexing . " In those days , venereal disease was thought to be the consequence of sexual overactivity . There were few cures , and fewer doctors willing to treat a patient with the illness . Most hospitals made no provision for gonorrhea and syphilis at all . A respectable man who contracted these diseases becamean easy target for blackmail ; thus Mr. Fowler 's reticence. ticence. 88 THE KEYS " How may I help you ? " Pierce asked , already knowing the answer . " I maintained the hope  --  not falsely , I pray  --  that as a bachelor , you might have knowledge  --  ah , that you might make an introduction on my behalf to a fresh girl , a country girl . " Pierce frowned . " It is no longer so easy as it once was . " " I know that , I know that , " Fowler said , his voice rising heatedly . He checked himself , and spoke more quietly . " I understand the difficulty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a woman in the Haymarket , " he said , " who often has a fresh or two . I can make discreet inquiries .

" I should be forever in your debt , " Mr. Fowler said . " It i5 most painful . " " I shall inquire , " Pierce said . " You may expect a communicationfrom me in a day or so . In the meanwhile , do not lose cheer . " " Oh , thank you , thank you , " Fowler said , and called fox another drink . " It may be expensive , " Pierce warned . " Damn the expense , man .

" Indeed , and only if I am fortunate enough to strike a favorable bargain . They are much in demand , you know . " " Well , then , it shall be , " Mr. Fowler said , gulping another drink . " Whatever it is , it shall be . " Two days later , Mr. Fowler received by the newly institutedpenny post a letter addressed to him at his offices atThe Necessity of a Fresh 89the Huddleston &; Bradford Bank . Mr. Fowler was much reassuredby the excellent quality of the stationery , and the fine penmanship displayed by the unmistakably feminine hand . Nov. 1854 Sir , Our mutual acquaintance , Mr. P. , has requested that I inform you when next I knew of any lady  --  fresh . I am pleased to recommend to you a very pretty fair young girl , just come from the country , and I think you will like her very much . If it is convenient for you , you may meet her in four days ' time at Lichfield Street , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . She shall be there waiting for you , and suitable arrangements for private quarterings have been made nearby . I remain , Sir , your most obedient humble servant , M.B.South Moulton StreetThere was no mention of the price of the girl , but Mr. Fowler hardly cared . His private parts were now swollen and extremely tender , so much so , in fact , that he could think of nothing else as he sat at his desk and tried to conduct the business of the day . He looked again at the letter and again felt reassured by the excellent impression it made . In every aspect , it smacked of the utmost reliability , and that was important . Fowler knew that many virgins were nothing of the ort , but rather young girls initiated a score of times over , with their " demure state " freshly renewed by the application Df a small seamstress 's stitch in a strategic place . He also knew that intercourse with a virgin was not uniFormlyaccepted as a cure for venereal disease . Many men ; wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was often argued that the failures resulted from thefact that the girl was not genuinely fresh . Thus Mr. Fowler looked at the stationery and the penmanship , and found there the reassurance he hoped to find . He sent off a quick note of vague thanks to his friend Pierce for his assistance in this matterCHAPTER 18 The Carriage FakementOn the same day that Mr. Fowler was writing a letter of thanks to Mr. Pierce , Mr. Pierce was preparing to crack the mansion of Mr. Trent . Involved in this plan were five people : fierce , who had some inside knowledge of the layout of the house ; Agar , who would make the wax impression of the key ; Agar 's woman , who would act as " crow , " or lookout ; and Barlow , who would be a " stall , " providing diversion . There was also the mysterious Miss Miriam . She was essentialto the planned housebreak , for she would carry out what was called " the carriage fakement . " This was one of the most clever methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage fakement relied upon a solid social custom of the day  --  the tipping of servants . In Victorian England , roughly i o percent of the entire population was " in service , " and nearly all were poorly paid . The poorest paid were those whose tasks brought them in contact with visitors and house guests : the butler and the hall porter relied on tips for most of their annual income . Thus the notorious disdain of the porter for insubstantial callers  --  and thus , too , the " carriage fakement . " By nine o'clock on the evening of November 12 , 1854 , Pierce had his confederates in their places . The crow , Agar 's woman , lounged across the street from the Trent mansion . Barlow , the stall , had slipped down the alley toward the tradesman 's entrance and the dog pens at the back of the house . Pierce and Agar were concealed in shrubbery right next to the front door . When all was in readiness , an elegant closed carriage drew up to the curb in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent household 's hall porter heard the ring , and opened the door . He saw the carriage drawn up at the curb . Dignified and conscious of tips , the porter was certainly not going to stand in the doorway and shout into the night to inquire what was wanted . When , after a moment , no one emerged from the carriage , he went down the steps to the curb to see if he could be of service . Inside the carriage he saw a handsome , refined woman who asked if this was the residence of Mr. Robert Jenkins . The porter said it was not , but he knew of Mr. Jenkins ; the house was around the corner , and he gave directions . While this was happening , Pierce and Agar slipped into the house through the open front door . They proceeded directly to the cellar door . This door was locked , but Agar employed a twirl , or picklock , and had it open in a moment . The two men were inside the cellar , with the door closed behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady in the carriage . The porter tossed the coin in the air , caught it , walked back to the house , and locked up the door once more , nevelr suspecting he had been tricked . That was the carriage fakemenfIn the light of a narrow-beam lantern , Pierce checked his watch . It was 9:04 . That gave them an hour to find the key before Barlow provided his diversion to cover their escape . Pierce and Agar moved stealthily down the creaking stairs into the depths of the cellar . They saw the wine racks , locked behind iron gratings . These new locks yielded easily to Agar'sattentions . At 9 : II , they swung the grating door open and entered the wine cellar proper . They immediately began the search for the key . There was no way to be clever about the search . It was a slow and painstaking business . Pierce could make only one assumption about the hiding place : since Mr. Trent 's wife was the person who usually went into the cellar , and since Mr. Trent did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banker probably hid his key at some inconveniently high location . They first searched the tops of the racks , feelingwith their fingers . It was dusty , and there was soon a good deal of ( lust in the air . Agar , with his bad lungs , had difficulty suppressing his cough . Several times his stifled grunts were sufficiently loud to alarm Pierce , but the Trent household never heard them . Soon it was 9:30 . Now , Pierce knew , time was beginning to work against them . Pierce searched more frantically and became impatient , hissing his complaints to Agar , who wielded the spot of light from the hot shaded lantern . Ten more minutes passed , and Pierce began to sweat . And then , with startling suddenness , his fingers felt something cold on the top of the wine-rack crossbars . The object fell to the ground with a metallic clink . A few moments of scramblitrg around on the earthen floor of the cellar , and they had the key . It was 9:45 . Pierce held it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is it ? " Pierce whispered . " That 's not it . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean it 's not the ruddy key , it 's the wrong one . " Pierce turned the key over in his hands . " Are you sure ? " he whispered , but even as he spoke he knew Agar was right . The key was dusty and old ; there was grime in the crevices of the prongs . Agar spoke his thoughts . " Nobody 's touched her in ten years . " Pierce swore , and continued his search , while Agar held the lantern . Agar looked at the key critically . " Damn me but she 's odd , " he whispered . " I never seen the likes of it . Small as she is , delicate-like , could be a lady 's twirl to some female trifle , you ask me  --  " "  --  Shut up , " Pierce hissed . Agar fell silent . Pierce searched , feeling his heart thump in his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Then his fingers again felt cold metal . He brought it into the light . It was a shiny key . " That 's for a safe , " Agar said when he saw it . " Right , " Pierce said , sighing . He took the lantern and held it for Agar . Agar fished two wax blanks from his pockets . He held them in his hands to warm them a moment , and then he pressed the key into them , first one side , then the other . " Time ? " he whispered . " Nine-fifty-one , " Pierce said . " I 'll do another , " Agar said , and repeated the process with a second set of blanks . This was common practice among the most adept screwsmen , for one never knew when a blank might be later injured after a break-in . When he had two sets , Pierce returned the key to its hiding place . " Nine-fifty-seven . " " Crikey , it 's close . " They left the wine cellar , locking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement door . Then they waited . Barlow , lurking in the shadows near the servants ' quarters , checked his own pocket watch and saw it was ten o'clock . He had a moment of hesitation . On the one hand , every minute his accomplices spent inside the Trent household was dangerous ; on the other hand , they might not have finished their work , despite the planned schedule . He had no wish to be the villain , greeted by the spectacle of their angry faces when they made their escape . Finally he muttered to himself , " Ten is ten , " and , carrying a bag , he moved back to the dog kennels . Three dogs were there , including the new gift of a made dog from Mr. Pierce . Barlow bent over the run and pushed four squeaking rats out of the bag and into the enclosure . Immediately , the dogs began to yelp and bark , raising a terrible din . Barlow slipped off into the shadows as he saw the lights come on in one window after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the commotion , opened the cellar door and moved into the hallway , locking that door behind them . There was the sound of running footsteps at the back of the house . They unfastened the locks and bolts of the front door , let themselves out , and disappeared into the night . They left behind them only one sign of their visit : the unlocked front door . They knew that in the morning the hall porter , being first to arise , would come upon the front door and find the locks open . But the porter would remember the incident of the carriage the night before , and would assumethat he had forgotten to lock up afterward . He might secretly suspect a housebreak , but as the day went on and nothing was discovered missing , he would forget all about it . In any case , no burglary of the Trent residence was ever reported to authorities . The mysterious commotion of the dogs was explained by the bodies of the dead rats in the kennel . There was some discussion of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Trent household was large and busy , and there was no time for idle speculation on trivial matters . Thus , by dawn of November 13 , 1854 , Edward Pierce had the first of the four keys he needed.He immediately directed his attention to obtaining the second key . Mr. Henry Fowler could scarcely believe his eyes . There , in the faint glow of the street gas lamp , was a delicate creature , rosy-cheeked and wonderfully young . She could not be much past the age of consent of twelve , and her very posture , bearing , and timid manner bespoke her tender and uninitiated state . He approached her ; she replied softly , halting , with downcasteyes , and led him to a brothel lodging house not far distant . Mr. Fowler eyed the establishment with some trepidation , for the exterior was not particularly prepossessing . Thus it was a pleasant surprise when the child 's gentle knock at the door received an answer from an exceedingly beautiful woman , whom the child called " Miss Miriam . " Standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those crude establishments where beds rented for five shillings an hour and the proprietor came round and rapped on the door with a stick when the time was due ; on the contrary , here the furnishings were plush velvet , with rich drapings , fine Persian carpets , and appointments of taste and quality . Miss Miriam comported herself with extraordinarydignity as she requested one hundred and fifty pounds ; her manner was so wellborn that Fowler paid without a quibble , and he proceeded directly to an upstairs room withTt le little girl , whose name was Sarah . Sarah explained that she had lately come from Derbyshire , that her parents were dead . that she had an older brother offThe ease with which Pierce and his fellow conspirators obtainedthe first two keys gave them a sense of confidence that was soon to prove false . Almost immediately after obtaining Fowler 's key , they ran into difficulties from an unexpected quarter : the South Eastern Railway changed its routine for the dispatcher 's offices in London Bridge Station . The gang employed Miss Miriam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1854 , she returned with bad news . At a meeting in Pierce 's house , she told both Pierce and Agar that the railway company had hired a jack who now guarded the premises at night . Since they had been planning to break in at night , this was sour news indeed. , But according to Agar , Pierce covered his disappointment quickly . " What 's his rig ? " he asked . " He comes on duty at lock-up each night , at seven sharp , " Miss Miriam said . " And what manner of fellow is he ? " " He 's a ream escop , " she replied , meaning a real policeman . " He 's forty or so ; square-rigged , fat . But I 'll wager he does n't sleep on the job , and he 's no lushington . " " Is he armed ? " " He is , " she said , nodding . " Where 's he lurk , then ? " Agar said . " Right at the door . Sits up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move at all . He has a small paper bag atThe Coopered KenCHAPTER 2096 THE KEYSin the Crimea , and a younger brother in the poorhouse . She talked of all these events almost gaily as they ascended the stairs . Fowler thought he detected a certain overexcited qual- ity to her speech ; no doubt the poor child was nervous at her first experience , and he reminded himself to be gentle . The room they entered was as superbly furnished as the downstairs sitting room ; it was red and elegant , and the air was softly perfumed with the scent of jasmine . He looked about briefly , for a man could never be too careful . Then he bolted the door and turned to face the girl . " Well , now , " he said . " Sir ? " she said . " Well , now , " he said . " Shall , we , ah . . . " " Oh , yes , of course , sir , " she said , and the simple child began to undress him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this elegant  --  very nearly decadent  --  room and have a little child who stood barely to his waist reach up with her little fingers and pluck at his buttons , undressing him . Altogether , it was so remarkable he submitted passively , and soon was naked , although she was still attired . " What is this ? " she asked , touching a key around his neck on a silver chain . " Just a  --  ah  --  key , " he replied . " You 'd best take it off , " she said , " it may harm me . " He took it off . She dimmed the gaslights , and then disrobed . The next hour or two was magical to Henry Fowler , an ex- perience so incredible , so astounding he quite forgot his painful condition . And he certainly did not notice that a stealthy hand slipped around one of the heavy red velvet drapes and plucked away the key from atop his clothing ; nor did he notice when , a shorttime later , the key- was returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital moment . " Oh , sir !

" Miss Miria:6n could not be sure of that , because she dared not remain watching the station office too late in the day for fear of arousing suspicion . " Crikey , " Agar said in disgust . " Sits right by the door ? He 's coopered that ken . " " I wonder why they put on a night guard , " Pierce said . " Maybe they knew we were giving it the yack , " Agar said , for they had kept the office under surveillance , off and on , for a period of months , and someone might have noticed . Pierce sighed . " No gammon now , " Agar said . " There 's always a gammon , " Pierce said . " It 's coopered for sure , " Agar said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more difficult is all . " " How you going to knock it over , then ? " Agar said . " At the dinner hour , " he said . " In broad daylight ? " Agar said , aghast . " Why not ? " Pierce said . The following day , Pierce and Agar watched the midday routine of the office . At one o'clock , the London Bridge Station was crowded with passengers coming and going ; porters hauling luggage behind elegant travelers on their way to coaches ; hawkers shouting refreshments for sale ; and three or four policemen moving around , keeping order and watch- ing for buzzers  --  pickpockets  --  since train stations were be- coming their new favorite haunt . The dipper would nail his quarry as he boarded the train , and the victim would not discover the robbery until he was well out of London . The association of pickpockets with train stations became so notorious that when William Frith painted one of the most famous pictures of his generation , " The Railway Station , " in 1862 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinching a thief . Now the London Bridge Station had several Metropolitan Police constables . And the railway companies had private guards as well . " It 's fair aswarm with miltonians , " Agar said unhappily , looking around the station platforms . " Never mind that , " Pierce said . He watched the railway office . At one o'clock , the clerks clambered down the iron stairs , chattering among themselves , off to lunch . The traffic manager , a stern gentleman in muttonchop whiskers , remained inside . The clerks were back at two o'clock , and the office routineresumed . The next day , the manager went to lunch but two of the clerks remained behind , skipping lunch . By the third day , they knew the pattern : one or more of the men in the office went to lunch for an hour at one o'clock , but the office was never left unattended . The conclusion was clear . " No daylight gammon , " Agar said . " Perhaps Sunday , " Pierce said , thinking aloud . In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway system strongly resisted operations on the Sabbath . It was considered unnecessary and unseemly for any company to do business on Sunday , and the railways in particular had always shown an oddly moralistic bent . For example , smoking on railway carriages was forbidden long after smoking became a widespread custom in society ; a gentleman who wished to enjoy a cigar was obliged to tip the railroad porter  --  anotherforbidden act  --  and this state of affairs continued , despite the intense pressure of public opinion , until 1868 , when Parliament finally passed a law forcing the railroads to allow passengers to smoke . Similarly , although everyone agreed that the most Godfearingmen sometimes needed to travel on the Sabbath , and although the popular custom of weekend excursions provided ever more pressure for Sunday schedules , the railroads foughtI00 THE KEYSstubbornly against this trend . In 1854 , the South Eastern Railwayran only four trains on Sunday , and the other line that used London Bridge , the London &; Greenwich Railway , ran only six trains , less than half the usual number . Pierce and Agar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double guard posted outside the traffic manager 's office ; one jack stationed himself near the door , and the secondwas positioned near the foot of the stairs . " Why ? " Pierce asked when he saw the two guards . " Why , in God 's name , why ? " In later courtroom testimony , it emerged that the South Eastern Railway management changed hands in the fall of 1854 . Its new owner , Mr. Willard Perkins , was a gentleman of philanthropic bent whose concern for the lower classes was such that he introduced a policy of employing more people at all positions on the line , " in order to provide honest work for those who might otherwise be tempted into lawlessnessand improvident promiscuity . " The extra personnel were hired for this reason alone ; the railway never suspected a robbery , and indeed Mr. Perkins was greatly shocked when his line was eventually robbed . It is also true that at this time the South Eastern Railway was trying to build new access lines into downtown London , and this caused the displacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus this philanthropic endeavor had a certain public-relations aspect in the minds of the railwayowners . " No gammon on Sunday , " Agar said , looking at the two guards . " Perhaps Christmas ? " Pierce shook his head . It was possible that security might be relaxed on Christmas Day , but they could not depend on that . " We need something routine , " he said . " There 's nothing to be done by day . " " Yes , " Pierce said . " But we do n't know the full night routine . We never had an all-night watch . " At night theThe Coopered Ken ioistation was deserted , and loiterers and tramps were briskly ordered off by the policemen making their rounds . " They 'll shoo away a canary , " Agar said . " And perhaps collar him as well . " " I was thinking of a canary in a lurk , " Pierce said . A concealedman could remain all night in the station . " Clean Willy ? " " No , " Pierce said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a downy bone in his body . He 's glocky . " " It 's true he 's glocky , " Agar said . Clean Willy , dead at the time of the trial , was noted in courtroom testimony to be of " diminished faculties of reasoning " ; this was reported by several witnesses . Pierce himselfsaid , " We felt we could not trust him to do the surveillance . If he were apprehended , he would put down on us  --  reveal our plans  --  and never know the difference . " " Who shall we have instead ? " Agar said , looking around the station . " I was thinking of a skipper , " Pierce said . " A skipper ? " Agar said , in surprise . " Yes , " Pierce said . " I think a skipper would do nicely . Do you happen to know of a bone skipper ? " " I can find one . But what 's the lurk , then ? " " We 'll pack him in a crate , " Pierce said . Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered to his residence . Agar obtained , by his own accounting , " a very reliable skipper , " and arrangements were made to send the crate to the railway station . The skipper , named Henson , was never found , nor was there much attempt to track him down ; he was a very minor figure in the entire scheme , and by his very nature was somebodynot worth bothering with . For the term " skipper " did not imply an occupation , but rather a way of life , and more specifically a way of spending the night . During the mid-century , London 's population was grow-102 THE KEYS ing at the rate of 20 percent per decade . The number of peo- ple in the city was increasing by more than a thousand per day , and even with massive building programs and densely crowded slums , a sizable fraction of the population lacked both shelter and the means to pay for it . Such people spent their nights outdoors , wherever the police with the dreaded bull's-eye lanterns would leave them alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meaning the arches of railway bridges , but there were other haunts : ruined buildings , shop doorways , boiler rooms , omnibus de- pots , empty market stalls , under hedges , any place that pro- vided a kip . " Skippers " were people who routinely sought another kind of shelter : barns and outhouses . At this time , even rather elegant households frequently lacked indoor ) plumbing ; the outhouse was a fixture among all classes , and it was increasingly found in public places as well . The skipper would wedge himself into these narrow confines and sleep away the night . At his trial , Agar spoke proudly of the way he had pro- cured a reliable skipper . Most of the night people were muck-snipes or tramps , wholly down and out ; skippers were a little more enterprising than most , but they were still at the bottom of the social order . And they were often soaks ; no doubt their intoxication helped them tolerate their fragrant resting places . The reason Pierce wanted a skipper , of course , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . The man Henson was reported to have found his shipping crate " ever so wide " as he was nailed into it . This crate was placed strategically within London Bridge Station . Through the slats , Henson was able to watch the be- havior of the night guard . After the first night , the crate was hauled away , painted another color , and returned to the station again . This routine was followed three nights in suc- cession . Then Henson reported his findings . None of the thieves was encouraged . " The jack 's solid , " he told Pierce . " Regular as this very clock . " He held up the stopwatch Pierce had given him to time the activities . " Comes on at seven prompt , with his little paper bag of supper . Sits on the steps , always alert , never a snooze , greeting the crusher on his rounds . " " What are the rounds ? " " First crusher works to midnight , goes every eleven minutesround the station . Sometimes he goes twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's eleven for him . Second crusher works midnight to the dawn . He 's a flummut crusher , keeps to no beat but goes this way and that , popping up here and there like a jack-in-a-box , with a wary eye in all directions . And he 's got himself two barkers at his belt . " " What about the jack who sits by the office door ? " Pierce said . " Solid , like I say , ream solid . Comes at seven , chats with the first crusher  --  he do n't care for the second crusher , he cools him with a steady eye , he does . But the first crusher he likes , chats now and again with him , but never a stop in the crusher 's rounds , just a little chat . " " Does he ever leave his place ? " Pierce said . " No , " the skipper said . " He sits right there , and then he hears the bells of Saint Falsworth ringing the hour , and each time they ring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he opens his bag , and eats his tightener , always at the ringing of the clock . Now he eats for maybe ten , fifteen minutes , and he has a bottle of reeb "  --  beer  --  " and then the crusher comes around again . Now the jack sits back , taking his ease , and he waits until the crusher comes once more . Now it 's half past eleven or thereabouts . And then the crusher passes him by , and the jack goes to the loo . " " Then he does leave his place , " Pierce said . " Only for the pisser . " " And how long is he gone ? " " I was thinking you might want to know , " Henson said , " so I clocked it proper . He 's gone sixty-four seconds oneThe Coopered Ken 105  --  but he lacked the sense to do so . This was only one of several instances in which incomprehensible criminal slang halted courtroom proceedings . ) " I swear , Mr. Pierce , " the skipper said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And the jack never left except that one time each night ? " " Aye , and every night the same . He 's regular as this jerry "  --  he held up his stopwatch  --  " that jack is . " Pierce thanked the skipper , paid him a half-crown for his troubles , allowed himself to be whined and cajoled into payingan additional half-crown , and sent the man on his way . As the door closed on the skipper , Pierce told Barlow to " worry " the man ; Barlow nodded and left the house by anotherexit . When Pierce returned to Agar , he said , " Well ? Is it a coopered ken ? " " Sixty-four seconds , " Agar said , shaking his head . " That 's not your kinchin lay "  --  not exactly robbing children . " I never said it was , " Pierce said . " But you keep telling me you 're the best screwsman in the country , and here 's a fitting challenge for your talents : is it a coopered ken ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to practice the lay . And I need to cool it close up . Can we pay a visit ? " " Certainly , " Pierce said. 1 04 THE KEYSnight , and sixty-eight the next night , and sixty-four the third night . Always at the same time of the night , near about eleven-thirty . And he 's back to his post when the guard makes the last round , quarter to midnight , and then the other crusher comes on to the beat . " " He did this every night ? " " Everyyynight . It 's the reeb does it . Reeb makes a man have a powerfi. l urge . " " Yes , " Pierce said , " beer does have that effect . Now does he leave his post at any other time ? " " Not to my eye . " " And you never slept ? " " What ? When I 'm sleeping here all the day through on your nice bed , here in your lodgings , and you ask if I kip the night away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but without any great sense of urgency . ( Agar later testified : " Pierce asks him the questions , see , but he shows no interest in the matter , he plays like a flimp or a dub buzzer , or a mutcher , no interest or importance , and this because he do n't want the skipper to granny that a bone lay is afoot . Now the skipper should have done , we went to a lot of trouble on his account , and he could have put down on us to the miltonians , and for a pretty penny , too , but he has n't the sense , otherwise why 'd he be a skipper , eh ? " ( This statement put the court into an uproar . When His Lordship requested an explanation , Agar said with an expression of surprise that he had just explained it as best he could . It required several minutes of interrogation to make it clear that Agar meant that Pierce had pretended to be a " flimp or dub buzzer "  --  that is , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a man who rolled drunks  --  in order to deceive the skipper , so that the skipper would not comprehendthat a good criminal plan was being worked out . Agar also said that the skipper should have figured it out for himself and " put down " on them  --  that is , squealed to the policeAn Audacious Act 107CHAPTER 21An Audacious Act " Of recent weeks , " wrote the Illustrated London News on December 21 , 1854 , " the incidence of bold and brutal street banditry has reached alarming proportions , particularly of an evening . It would appear that the faith Mr. Wilson placed in street gas lighting as a deterrent to blackguard acts has been unjustified , for the villains are ever bolder , preying upon an unsuspecting populace with the utmost audacity . Only yesterday a constable , Peter Farrell , was lured into an alley , whereupon a band of common thugs fell upon him , beating him and taking all of his possessions and even his very uniform . Nor must we forget that just a fortnight past , Mr. Parkington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while walking from Parliament to his club . This epidemic of garrotting must receive the prompt attention of authorities in the near future . " The article went on to describe the condition of ConstableFarrell , who was " faring no better than could be expected . " The policeman gave the story that he had been called by a well-dressed woman who was arguing with her cabdriver , " a surly thug of a fellow with a white scar across the forehead . " When the policeman interceded in the dispute , the cabby fell on him , swearing and cursing and beatinghim with a neddy , or blackjack ; and when the unfortunatepoliceman came to his senses , he discovered he had been stripped of his clothing . In 1854 , many urban-dwelling Victorians were concernedover what was viewed as an upsurge in street crime . Later periodic " epidemics " of street violence finally culminated in a pedestrian panic during the years 1862 and 1863 , and the passage of the " Garrotting Act " by Parliament . This legislationprovided unusually stiff penalties for offenders , includingflogging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next scheduled beating  --  and hanging . Indeed , more people were hanged in England in 1863 than in any year since 1838 . Brutal street crime was the lowest form of underworld activity . Rampsmen and footpads were frequently despised by their fellow criminals , who abhorred crude lays and acts of violence . The usual method of footpadding called for a victim , preferably drunk , to be lured into a corner by an accomplice , preferably a woman , whereupon the footpad would " bear up " on the victim , beat him with a cudgel and rob him , leaving him in the gutter . It was not an elegant way to make a living . The lurid details of a footpadder bearing up on his hapless quarry were the ordinary fare of news reporting . Apparently , no one ever stopped to think how strange the attack on Constable Farrell really was . In fact , it made very little sense . Then , as now , criminals tried wherever possible to avoid confrontations with the police . To " prop a crusher " was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprits were apprehended , for the police took a special interest in attacks on their own kind . Nor was there any sensible reason to attack a policeman . He was more capable than most victims of defending himself , and he never carried much money ; often he had no money at all . And , finally , there was absolutely no point in stripping a policeman . In those days , stripping was a common crime , usually the work of old women who lured children into alleys and then took all their clothing to sell at a secondhand shop . But you could not take the down off a crusher'sI o8 THE KEYS dunnage ; that is , you could not disguise a policeman 's uni- form so that it would have usale value . Secondhand shops were always under surveillance , and always accused of taking stolen goods ; no " translator " would ever accept a police uni- form . It was perhaps the only kind of clothing in all London that had no resale value at all . Thus the attack on Constable Farrell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer would have been led to ponder why it had occurred at all . C H A P T E R 2 2The Prad Prig Sometime in late December , 1854 , Pierce met a man named Andrew Taggert in the King 's Arms publican house , off Regent Street . Taggert was by then nearly sixty , and a well- known character in the neighborhood . He had survived a long and varied career , which is worth briefly recounting , . for he is one of the few participants in The Great Train Robbery whose background is known . Taggert was born around 1790 outside Liverpool , and came to London near the turn of the century with his un- married mother , a prostitute . By the age of ten , he was em- ployed in " the resurrection trade , " the business of digging up fresh corpses from graveyards to sell to medical schools . He ' soon acquired a reputation for uncommon daring ; it was said that he once transported a stiff through London streets in daylight , with the man propped up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1838 ended the business in corpses , and Andrew Taggert shifted to the smasher 's job of " ringing the changes "  --  disposing of counterfeit money . In this maneuver , a genuine coin would be offered to a shopkeeper for some purchase , and then the smasher would fumble in his purse , saying that he thought he had correct change , and take the original coin back . After a while , he would say , " No , I do n't have it , after all , " and hand over a counterfeit coin in place of the original . This was petty work , and Taggertsoon tired of it . He moved on to a variety of con games , becoming a full-fledged magsman by the middle 184os . He was apparently very successful in his work ; he took a respectableflat in Camden Town , which was not a wholly respectable area . ( Charles Dickens had lived there some fifteen years earlier , while his father was in prison . ) Taggert also took a wife , one Mary Maxwell , a widow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magsman should himselfbe conned . Mary Maxwell was a coiner specializing in small silver coins . This bit-faker had served time in prison on several occasions , and knew something of the law , which her new husband apparently did not , for she had not married idly . A woman 's legal position was already the subject of active attempts at reform ; but at this time women did not have the right to vote , to own property , or to make wills , and the earnings of any married woman who was separated from her husband were still legally the property of her husband . Althoughthe law treated women as near idiots and appeared overwhelmingly to favor men , there were some odd quirks , as Taggert discovered soon enough . In 1847 , the police raided Mary Maxwell Taggert 's coiningoperation , catching her red-handed in the midst of stampingout sixpence pieces . She greeted the raid with equanimity , announced pleasantly that she was married , and told the police the whereabouts of her husband . By law , a husband was responsible for any criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that such activity must be the result of the husband 's planning and execution , in which the wife was a mere  --  and perhaps unwilling  --  participant . In July , 1847 , Andrew Taggert was arrested and convictedof counterfeiting currency and sentenced to eight years in Bridewell Prison ; Mary Maxwell was released withouto much as a reprimand . She is said to have displayed " a roistering , bantering demeanour " in the courtroom at the time of her husband 's sentencing . Taggert served three years , and was given a ticket-of-leave and allowed to depart . Afterward it was said the steel had gone out of him , a common consequence of a prison term ; he no longer had the energy or the confidence to be a magsman , and turned to hoof-snaffling , or horse stealing . By 1854 , he was a familiar face in the flash sporting pubs frequented by turfites ; he was said to have been involved in the scandal of 1853 in which a four-year-old was passed off as a three-yearold.inthe Derby . No one was certain but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have engineered the theft of the most famous prad of recent years : Silver Whistle , a threeyear-oldfrom Derbyshire . Pierce met him in the King 's Arms with a most peculiar suggestion , and Taggert gulped his gin as he said , " You want to snaffle a what ? " " A leopard , " Pierce said . " Now , where 's an honest man like me to find a leopard ? " Taggert said . " I would n't know , " Pierce said . " Never in my life , " Taggert said , " would I know of any leopard , excepting the bestiaries here and there , which have all manner of beasts . " " That 's so , " Pierce said calmly . " Is it to be christened ? " Now this was a particularly difficult problem . Taggert was an expert christener  --  a man who could conceal the fact that goods were stolen . He could disguise the markings of a horseThe Prad Prig IIIso that even its owner would not recognize it . But christeninga leopard might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can take it as you have it . " " Wo n't gull nobody . " " It does n't have to . " " What 's it for , then ? " Pierce gave Taggert a particularly severe look and did not reply . " No harm in asking , " Taggert said . " It 's not every day a man gets asked to snaffle a leopard , so I ask why  --  no harm intended . " " It is a present , " Pierce said , " for a lady . " " Ah , a lady . " " On the Continent . " " Ah , on the Continent . " " In Paris . " " Ah . " Taggert looked him up and down . Pierce was well dressed . " You could buy one right enough , " he said . " Cost you just as dear as buying from me . " " I made you a business proposition . " " So you did , and a proper one , too , but you did n't mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knapped leopard . " " I 'll pay you twenty guineas . " " Cor , you 'll pay me forty and count yourself lucky . " " I 'll pay you twenty-five and you 'll count yourself lucky , " Pierce said . Taggert looked unhappy . He twisted his gin glass in his hands . " All right , then , " he said . " When 's it to be ? " " Never you mind , " Pierce said . " You find the animal and set the lay , and you 'll hear from me soon enough . " And he dropped a gold guinea on the counter . Taggert picked it up , bit it , nodded , and touched his cap . " Good day to you , sir , " he said . " Good day , " Pierce said . The Jolly Gaff 113CHAPTER 23The Jolly GaffThe twentieth-century urban dweller 's attitude of fear or indifference to a crime in progress would have astounded the Victorians . In those days , any person being robbed or mugged immediately raised a hue and cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from law-abiding citizensaround him , who joined in the fray with alacrity in an attempt to catch the bolting villain . Even ladies of breeding were known , upon occasion , to participate in a fracas with enthusiasm . There were several reasons for the willingness of the populaceto get involved in a crime . In the first place , an organized police force was still relatively new ; London 's Metropolitan Police was the best in England , but it was only twenty-five years old , and people did not yet believe that crime was " something for the police to take care of . " Second , firearms were rare , and remain so to the present day in England ; there was little likelihood of a bystander stopping a charge by pursuing a thief . And finally , the majority of criminals were children , often extremely young children , and adults were not hesitant to go after them . In any case , an adept thief took great care to conduct his business undetected , for if any alarm was raised , the chances were that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in gangs , with several members acting as " stalls " to create confusion in any alarm . Criminals of the day also utilized the fracas  --  as a staged event  --  to cover illegalactivities , and this maneuver was known as a " jolly gaff . " A good jolly gaff required careful planning and timing , for it was , as the name implied , a form of theatre . On the morningof January 9 , 1855 , Pierce looked around the cavernous , echoing interior of the London Bridge Station and saw that all his players were in position . Pierce himself would perform the most crucial role , that of the " beefer . " He was dressed as a traveler , as was Miss Miriam alongside him . She would be the " plant . " A few yards distant was the " culprit , " a chavy nine years old , scruffy and noticeably ( should anyone care to observe it , too noticeably ) out of place among the crowd of firstclasspassengers . Pierce had himself selected the chavy from among a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; pure and simple . Farther away still was the " crusher , " Barlow , wearing a constable 's uniform with the hat pulled down to conceal the white scar across his forehead . Barlow would permit the child to elude him as the gaff progressed . Finally , not far from the steps to the railway dispatcher 's office was the whole point of the ploy : Agar , dressed out of twig  --  disguised  --  in his finest gentleman 's clothing . As it came time for the London &; Greenwich eleveno'clocktrain to depart , Pierce scratched his neck with his left hand . Immediately , the child came up and brushed rather abruptly against Miss Miriam 's right side , , rustling her purple velvet dress . Miss Miriam cried , " I 've been robbed , John ! " Pierce raised his beef : " Stop , thief ! " he shouted , and raced after the bolting chavy . " Stop , thief ! " Startled bystanders immediately grabbed at the youngster , but he was quick and slippery , and soon tore free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There Barlow in his policeman 's uniform came forward menacingly . Agar , as a civic-spirited gentleman , also joined in the pursuit . The child was trapped ; his only escape lay inI 14 THE KEYSa desperate scramble up the stairs leading to the railway office , and he ran hard , with Barlow , Agar , and Pierce fast on his heels . The little boy 's instructions had been explicit : he was to get up the stairs , into the office , past the desks of the clerks , and back to a high rear window opening out onto the roof of the station . He was to break this window in an apparent attempt to escape . Then Barlow would apprehend him . But he was to struggle valiantly until Barlow cuffed him ; this was his signal that the gaff had ended . The child burst into the South Eastern Railway office , startling the clerks . Pierce dashed in immediately afterward : " Stop him , he 's a thief ! " Pierce shouted and , in his own pursuit , knocked over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Barlow , the constable , came in . " I 'll handle this , " Barlow said , in an authoritative and tough voice , but he clumsily knocked one of the desks over and sent papers flying . " Catch him ! Catch him ! " Agar called , entering the offices . By now the child was scrambling up onto the station dispatcher'sdesk , going toward a narrow high window ; he cracked the glass with his small fist , cutting himself . The station dispatcher kept saying " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " over and over . " I am an officer of the law , make way ! " Barlow shouted . " Stop him ! " Pierce screamed , allowing himself to become quite hysterical . " Stop him , he 's getting away ! " Glass fragments from the window fell on the floor , and Barlow and the child rolled on the ground in an uneven struggle that took rather longer to resolve itself than one might expect . The clerks and the dispatchers watched in considerableconfusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commotionand picked the lock on the door to the office , trying several of his jangling ring of bettys until he found one that worked the mechanism . Nor did anyone notice when AgarHykey Doings I15then moved to the side wall cabinet , also fitted with a lock , which he also picked with one key after another until he found one that worked . Three or four minutes passed before the young ruffian  --  who kept slipping from the hands of the red-faced constable  --  was finally caught by Pierce , who held him firmly . At last the constable gave the little villain a good boxing on the ears , and the lad ceased to struggle and handed up the purse he had stolen . He was carted away by the constable . Pierce dusted himself off , looked around the wreckage of the office , and apologized to the clerks and the dispatcher . Then the other gentleman who had joined in the pursuit said , " I fear , sir , that you have missed your train . " " By God , I have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the two gentlemen departed  --  the one thanking the other for helping corner the thief , and the other saying it was nothing  --  leaving the clerks to clean up the mess . It was , Pierce later reflected , a nearly perfect jolly gaff . Hykey DoingsWhen Clean Willy Williams , the snakesman , arrived at Pierce 's house late in the afternoon of January 9 , 1855 , he found himself confronted by a very strange spectacle in the drawing room . Pierce , wearing a red velvet smoking jacket , lounged in an easy chair , smoking a cigar , utterly relaxed , a stopwatch in his hands . In contrast , Agar , in shirtsleeves , stood in the center of theI16 THE KEYSroom . Agar was bent into a kind of half-crouch ; he was watching Pierce and panting slightly . " Are you ready ? " Pierce said . Agar nodded . " Go ! " Pierce said , and flicked the stopwatch . To Clean Willy 's amazement , Agar dashed across the room to the fireplace , where he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving , in a low whisper , " . . . seven .. . eight . . . nine ... " " That 's it , " Pierce said . " Door ! " " Door ! " Agar said and , in pantomime , turned the handle on an unseen door . He then took three steps to the right , and reached up to shoulder height , touching something in the air . " Cabinet , " Pierce said . " Cabinet ... " Now Agar fished two wax flats out of his pocket , and pretended to make an impression of a key . " Time ? " he asked . " Thirty-one , " Pierce said . Agar proceeded to make a second impression , on a second set of flats , all the while counting to himself . " Thirty-three , thirty-four , thirty-five . . . " Again , he reached into the air , with both hands , as if closing something . " Cabinet shut , " he said , and took three paces back across the room . " Door ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agar said , and ran in place once more , and then sprinted across the room to halt beside Pierce 's chair . " Done ! " he cried . Pierce looked at the watch and shook his head . " Sixtynine . " He puffed on his cigar . " Well , " Agar said , in a wounded tone , " it 's better than it was . What was the last time ? " " Your last time was seventy-three . " " Well , it 's better  --  " "  --  But not good enough . Maybe if you do n't close theHykey Doings 117cabinet . And do n't hang up the keys , either . Willy can do that . " " Do what ? " Willy said , watching . " Open and close the cabinet , " Pierce said . Agar went back to his starting position . " Ready ? " Pierce said . " Ready , " Agar said . Once again , this odd charade was repeated , with Agar sprinting across the room , jogging in place , pretending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax impressions , taking three steps , closing a door , jogging in place , and then running across the room . " Time ? " Pierce smiled . " Sixty-three , " he said . Agar grinned , gasping for breath . " Once more , " Pierce said , " just to be certain . " Later in the afternoon , Clean Willy was given the lay . " It 'll be tonight , " Pierce said . " Once it 's dark , you 'll go upto London Bridge , and get onto the roof of the station . Thata problem ? " Clean Willy shook his head . " What then ? " " When you 're on the roof , cross to a window that is broken . You 'll see it ; it 's the window to the dispatcher 's office . Little window , barely a foot square . " " What then ? " " Get into the office . " " Through the window ? " " Yes . " " What then ? " " Then you will see a cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce looked at the little snakesman . " You 'll have to stand on a chair to reach it . Be very quiet ; there 's a jack posted outside the office , on the steps . " Clean Willy frowned . " Unlock the cabinet , " Pierce said , " with this key . " HeI18 THE KEYSnodded to Agar , who gave Willy the first of the picklocks . " Unlock the cabinet , and open it up , and wait . " " What for ? " " Around ten-thirty , there 'll be a bit of a shindy . A soak will be coming into the station to chat up the jack . " " What then ? " " Then you unlock the main door to the office , using this key here "  --  Agar gave him the second key  --  " and then you wait . " " What for ? " " For eleven-thirty , or thereabouts , when the jack goes to the W.C. Then Agar comes up the steps , through the door you 've unlocked , and he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first door right away . By now , the jack is back from the loo . You lock the cabinets , put the chair back , and go out the window , quiet-like . " " That 's the lay ? " Clean Willy said doubtfully . " That 's the lay . " " You popped me out of Newgate for this ? " Clean Willy said . " This is no shakes , to knock over a deadlurk . " " It 's a deadlurk with a jack posted at the door , and it 's quiet , you 'll have to be quiet-like , all the time . " Clean Willy grinned . " Those keys mean a sharp vamp . You 've planned . " " Just do the lay , " Pierce said , " and quiet . " " Piece of cake , " Clean Willy said . " Keep those dubs handy , " Agar said , pointing to the keys , " and have the doors ready and open when I come in , or it 's nommus for all of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't want to be nibbed , " Willy said . " Then look sharp , and be ready . " Clean Willy nodded . " What 's for dinner ? " he said . CHAPTER 25Breaking the DrumOn the evening of January 9th , a characteristic London " pea soup " fog , heavily mixed with soot , blanketed the town . Clean Willy Williams , easing down Tooley Street , one eye to the facade of London Bridge Station , was not sure he liked the fog . It made his movements on the ground less noticeable , but it was so dense that he could not see the second story of the terminus building , and he was worried about access to the roof . It would n't do to make the climb halfway , only to discover it was a dead end . But Clean Willy knew a lot about the way buildings were constructed , and after an hour of maneuvering around the station he found his spot . By climbing onto a porter 's luggage cart , he was able to jump to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-story windows . Here a lip of stone ran the length of the second story ; he inched along it until he reached a corner in the facade . Then he climbed up the corner , his back to the wall , in the same way that he had escaped from Newgate Prison . He would leave marks , of course ; in those days nearly every downtown London building was soot-covered , and Clean Willy 's climb left an odd pattern of whitish scrapes going up the corner . By eight o'clock at night he was standing on the broad roof of the terminus . The main portion of the station was roofed in slate ; over the tracks the roofing was glass , and he avoided that . Clean Willy weighed sixty-eight pounds , but he was heavy enough to break the glass roofing . Ito THE KEYS Moving cautiously through the fog , he edged around the building until he found the broken window Pierce had men- tioned . Looking in , he saw the dispatcher 's office . He was surprised to notice that it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office during the day and the damage only partially corrected . He reached through the jagged hole in the glass , turned the transom lock , and raised the window . It was a window of rectangular shape , perhaps nine by sixteen inches . He wriggled through it easily , stepped down onto a desk top , and paused . He had not been told the walls of the office were glass . Through the glass , he could see down to the deserted tracks and platforms of the station below . He could also see the jack on the stairs , near the door , a paper bag containing his dinner at his side . Carefully , Clean Willy climbed down off the desk . His foot crunched on a shard of broken glass ; he froze . But if the guard heard it , he gave no sign . After a moment , Willy crossed the office , lifted a chair , and set it next to the high cabinet . He stepped onto the chair , plucked the twirl Agar had given him from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down to wait , hearing distant church bells toll the hour of nine o'clock . Agar , lurking in the deep shadows of the station , also heard the church bells . He sighed . Another two and a half hours , and he had been wedged into a cramped corner for two hours already . He knew how stiff and painful his legs would be when he finally made his sprint for the stairs . From his hiding place , he could see Clean Willy make an entrance into the office behind the guard ; and he could see Willy 's head when he stood on the chair and worked the cabinet lock . Then Willy disappeared . Agar sighed again . He wondered , for the thousandth time , what Pierce intended to do with these keys . All he knew was that it must be a devilish flash pull . A few years earlier , Agar had been in on a Brighton warehouse pull . There had been nine keys involved : one for an outer gate , two for an inner gate , three for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for a storeroom . The pogue had been ten thousand quid in B. of E. notes , and the putter-up had spent four months arranging the lay . Yet here was Pierce , flush if ever a cracksman was , spendingeight months now to get four keys , two from bankers , and two from a railway office . It had all cost a pretty penny , Agar was certain of that , and it meant the pogue was well worth having . But what was it ? Why were they breaking this drum now ? The question preoccupied him more than the mechanics of timing a sixty-four-second smash and grab . He was a professional ; he was cool ; he had prepared well and was fully confident . His heart beat evenly as he stared across the stationat the jack on the stairs , as the crusher made his rounds . The crusher said to the jack , " You know there 's a P.R . on ? " A P.R . was a prize-ring event . " No , " said the jack . " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar Moxley . " " Where 's it to be , then ? " the jack said . " I hear Leicester , " the crusher said . " Where 's your money ? " " Stunning Bill , for my gambit ? ' " He 's a good one , " the jack said . " He 's tough , is Bill . " " Aye , " the crusher said , " I 've got a half-crown or two on him says he 's tough . " And the crusher went on , making his rounds . Agar smirked in the darkness . A copper talking big of a five-shilling bet . Agar bet ten quid on the last P.R. , between the Lancaster Dervish , John Boynton , and the gammy Kid Ballew . Agar had come off well on that one : odds were two to one ; he 'd done a bit of winning there . He tensed the muscles in his cramped legs , trying to getthe circulation going , and then he relaxed . He had a long wait ahead of him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of his dolly 's quim ; it was a natural thing  --  tension turned a man randy . Then his thoughts drifted back to Pierce , and the question that Agar had puzzled over for nearly a year now : what was the damn pull ? 1The drunken Irishman with the red beard and slouch hat stumbled through the deserted station singing " Molly Malone . " With his shuffling , flatfooted gait , he was a true soak , and as he walked along , it appeared he was so lost in his song that he might not notice the guard on the stairs . But he did , and he eyed the guard 's paper bag suspiciously before making an elaborate and wobbly bow . " And a good evenin ' to you , sir , " the drunk said . " Evening , " the guard said . " And what , may I inquire , " said the drunk , standing stiffer , " is your business up there , eh ? Up to no good , are you ? " " I 'm guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk hiccuped . " So you say , my good fellow , but many a rascal has said as much . " " Here , now  --  " " I think , " the drunk said , waving an accusatory finger in the air , trying to point it at the guard but unable to aim accurately , " I think , sir , we shall have the police to look you over , so that we shall know if you are up to no good . " " Now , look here , " the guard said . " You look here , and lively , too , " the drunk said , and abruptly began to shout , " Police ! Po-lice ! " " Here , now , " the guard said , coming down the stairs . " Get a grip on yourself , you scurvy soak . " " Scurvy soak ? " the drunk said , raising an eyebrow and shaking his fist . " I am a Dubliner , sir . " " I palled that , right enough , " the guard snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , drawn by the shouts of the drunk . " Ah , a criminal , officer , " said the drunk . " Arrest that scoundrel , " he said , pointing to the guard , who had now moved to the bottom of the stairs . " He is up to no good . " The drunk hiccuped . The constable and the guard exchanged glances , and then open smiles . " You find this a laughing matter , sir ? " said the drunk , turning to the copper . " I see nothing risible . The man is plainly up to no good . " " Come along , now , " the constable said , " or I 'll have you in lumber for creatin ' a nuisance . " " A nuisance ? " the drunk said , twisting free of the constable'sarm . " I think you and this blackguard are in cahoots , sir . " " That 's enough , " the constable said . " Come along smartly . " The drunk allowed himself to be led away by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would n't be havin ' a daffy of reeb , would you , now ? " and the constable assured him he had no drink on his person . " Dublin , " the guard said , sighing , and he climbed back up the stairs to eat his dinner . The distant chimes rang eleven o'clock . Agar had seen it all , and while he was amused by Pierce 's performance , he worried whether Clean Willy had taken the opportunity to open the office door . There was no way to know until he made his own mad dash , in less than half an hour now . He looked at his watch , he looked at the door to the office , and he waited . For Pierce , the most delicate part of his performance was the conclusion , when he was led by the constable out onto Tooley Street . Pierce did not want to disrupt the policeman's124 THE KEYSregular rhythm on the beat , so he had to disengage himself rather rapidly . As they came into the foggy night air , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it 's a lovely evening , brisk and invigor-ating . " The copper looked round at the gloomy fog . " Chill enough for me , " he said . " Well , my dear fellow , " Pierce said , dusting himself off and making a show of straightening up , as if the night air had sobered him , " I am most grateful for your ministrations upon this occasion , and I can assure you that I can carry on well from here . " " You 're not going to be creating another nuisance ? " " My dear sir , " Pierce said , standing still straighter , " what do you take me for ? " The copper looked back at the London Bridge Station . It was his business to stay on the beat ; a drunk wandering in was not his responsibility once he was ejected from the premises . And London was full of drunks , especially Irish ones who talked too much . " Stay clear of trouble , then , " the cop said , and let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pierce said , and bowed to the departing crusher . Then he wandered out into the fog , singing " Molly Malone . " Pierce went no farther than the end of Tooley Street , less than a block from the station entrance . There , hidden in the fog , was a cab . He looked up at the driver . " How 'd it carry off ? " Barlow asked . " Smart and tidy , " Pierce said . " I gave Willy two or three minutes ; it should have been enough . " " Willy 's a bit glocky . " " All he has to do , " Pierce said , " is twirl two locks , and he 's not too glocky to bring that off . " He glanced at his watch . " Well , we 'll know soon enough . " And he slipped away , in the fog , back toward the station . ' At eleven-thirty , Pierce had taken up a position where he could see the dispatch office stairs and the guard . The copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who waved back . The copper went on ; the jack yawned , stood , and stretched . Pierce took a breath and poised his finger on the stopwatch button . The guard came down the stairs , yawning again , and moved off toward the W.C. He walked several paces , and then was out of sight , around a corner . Pierce hit the button , and counted softly , " One . . . two .. . three ... " He saw Agar appear , running hard , barefooted to make no sound , and dashing up the stairs to the door . " Four . . . five . . . six ... " Agar reached the door , twisted the knob ; the door opened and Agar was inside . The door closed . " Seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . " " Ten , " Agar said , panting , looking around the office . Clean , Willy , grinning in the shadows in the corner , took up the count . " Eleven . . . twelve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened cabinet . He removed the first of the wax blanks from his pocket , and then looked at the keys in the cabinet . " Crikey ! " he whispered . " Fourteen . . . fifteen . . . sixteen . . . " Dozens of keys hung in the cabinet , keys of all sorts , large and small , labeled and unlabeled , all hanging on hooks . He broke into a sweat in an instant . " Crikey ! " " Seventeen . . . eighteen . . . nineteen ... " Agar was going to fall behind . He knew it with sickening suddenness : he was already behind on the count . He stared helplessly at the keys . He could not wax them all ; which were the ones to do ? 126 THE KEYS " Twenty . . . twenty-one . . . twenty-two ... " Clean Willy 's droning voice infuriated him ; Agar wanted to run across the , room and strangle the little bastard . He stared at the cabinet in a rising panic . He remembered what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were similar . He peered close at the cabinet , squinting , straining : the light in the office was bad . " Twenty-three . . . twenty-four . . . twenty-five . . . " " It 's no bloody use , " he whispered to himself . And then he realized something odd : each hook had only one key , except for a single hook , which had two . He quickly lifted them off . They looked like the others he had done . " Twenty-six ... twenty-seven . . . twenty-eight ... " He set out the first blank , and pressed one side of the first key into the blank , holding it neatly , plucking it out with his fingernail ; the nail on the little finger was long , one of the hallmarksof a screwsman . " Twenty-nine . . . thirty . . . thirty-one . . . " He took the second blank , flipped the key over , and pressed it into the wax to get the other side . He held it firmly , then scooped it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Now Agar 's professionalism came into play . He was falling behind  --  at least five seconds off his count now , maybe more  --  but he knew that at all costs he must avoid confusing the keys . It was common enough for a screwsman under pressure to make two impressions of the same side of a single key ; with two keys , the chance of confusion was doubled . Quickly but carefully , he hung up the first finished key . " Thirty-five . . . thirty-six . . . thirty-seven , Lordy , " Clean Willy said . Clean Willy was looking out the glass windows , down to where the guard would be returning in less than thirty seconds . " Thirty-eight . . . thirty-nine . . . forty ... " Swiftly , Agar pressed the second key into his third blank . Breaking the Drum 127He held it there just an instant , then lifted it out . There was a decent impression . " Forty-one . . . forty-two . . . forty-three . . . " Agar pocketed the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed the other side of the key into the soft material . " Forty-four . . . forty-five . . . forty-six . . . forty-seven ... " Abruptly , while Agar was peeling the key free of the wax , the blank cracked in two . " Damn ! " " Forty-eight . . . forty-nine . . . fifty ... " He fished in his pocket for another blank . His fingers were steady , but there was sweat dripping from his forehead . " Fifty-one . . . fifty-two . . . fifty-three ... " He drew out a fresh blank and did the second side again . " Fifty-four . . . fifty-five . . . " He plucked the key out , hung it up , and dashed for the door , still holding the final blank in his fingers . He left the office without another look at Willy . " Fifty-six , " Willy said , immediately moving to the door to lock it up . Pierce saw Agar exit , behind schedule by five full seconds . His face was flushed with exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Agar sprinted down the stairs , three at a time . " Fifty-nine . . . sixty . . . sixty-one ... " Agar streaked across the station to his hiding place . " Sixty-two . . . sixty-three . . . " Agar was hidden . The guard , yawning , came around the corner , still buttoningup his trousers . He walked toward the steps . " Sixty-four , " Pierce said , and flicked his watch . The guard took up his post at the stairs . After a moment , he began humming to himself , very softly , and it was awhile until Pierce realized it was " Molly Malone . " JCHAPTER 26 Crossing the Mary Blaine Scrob " The distinction between base avarice and honest ambition may be exceeding fine , " warned the Reverend Noel Blackwellin his 1853 treatise , On the Moral Improvement of the Human Race . No one knew the truth of his words better than Pierce , who arranged his next meeting at the Casino de Venise , on Windmill Street . This was a large and lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young men spun and wheeled girls colorfully dressed and gay in their manner . Indeed , the total impression was one of fashionable splendor , which belied a reputation as a wicked and notorious place of assignation for whores and their clientele . Pierce went directly to the bar , where a burly man in a blue uniform with silver lapel markings sat hunched over a drink . The man appeared distinctly uncomfortable in the casino . " Have you been here before ? " Pierce asked . The man turned . " You Mr. Simms ? " " That 's right . " The burly man looked around the room , at the women , the finery , the bright lights . " No , " he said , " never been before . " " Lively , do n't you think ? " The man shrugged . " Bit above me , " he said finally , and turned back to stare at his glass . " And expensive , " Pierce said . The man raised his drink . " Two shillings a daffy ? Aye , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pierce said , raising a grayCrossingthe Mary Blaine Scrob 129gloved hand to beckon the bartender . " Where do you live , Mr. Burgess ? " " I got a room on Moresby Road , " the burly man said . " I hear the air is bad there . " Burgess shrugged . " It 'll do . " " You married ? " " Aye . " The bartender came , and Pierce indicated two more drinks . " What 's your wife do ? " " She sews . " Burgess showed a flash of impatience . " What 's this all about , then ? " " Just a little conversation , " Pierce said , " to see if you want to make more money . " " Only a fool does n't , " Burgess said shortly . " You work the Mary Blaine , " Pierce said . Burgess , with still more impatience , nodded and flicked the silver SER letters on his collar : the insignia of the South Eastern Railway . Pierce was not asking these questions to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgess , a Mary Blaine scrob , or guard on the railway . He knew where Burgess lived ; he knew what his wife did ; he knew that they had two children , aged two and four , and he knew that the four-year-old was sickly and needed the frequent attentions of a doctor , which Burgess and his wife could not afford . He knew that their room on Moresby Road was a squalid , peeling , narrow chamber that was ventilated by the sulfurous fumes of an adjacent gasworks . He knew that Burgess fell into the lowest-paid category of railway employee . An engine driver was paid 35 shillings a week ; a conductor 25 shillings ; a coachman 20 or 21 ; but a guard was paid 15 shillings a week and counted himself lucky it was not a good deal less . Burgess 's wife made ten shillings a week , which meant that the family lived on a total of about sixty-five pounds a year. 130 THE KEYSOut of this came certain expenses  --  Burgess had to provide his own uniforms  --  so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and for a family of four it was a very rough go . Many Victorians had incomes at that level , but most contrivedsupplements of one sort or another : extra work , tips , and a child in industry were the most common . The Burgess household had none of these . They were compelled to live on their income , and it was little wonder that Burgess felt uncomfortable in a place that charged two shillings a drink . It was very far beyond his means . " What 's it to be ? " Burgess said , not looking at Pierce . " I was wondering about your vision . " " My vision ? " " Yes , your eyesight . " " My eyes are good enough . " " I wonder , " Pierce said , " what it would take for them to go bad . " Burgess sighed , and did not speak for a moment . Finally he said in a weary voice , " I done a stretch in Newgate a few years back . I 'm not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pierce said . " And I do n't want anybody to blow my lay . We both have our fears . " Burgess gulped his drink . " What 's the sweetener ? " " Two hundred quid , " Pierce said . Burgess coughed , and pounded his chest with a thick fist . " Two hundred quid , " he repeated . " That 's right , " Pierce said . " Here 's ten now , on faith . " He removed his wallet and took out two five-pound notes ; he held the wallet in such a way that Burgess could not fail to notice it was bulging . He set the money on the bar top . " Pretty a sight as a hot nancy , " Burgess said , but he did not touch it . " What 's the lay ? " " You need n't worry over the lay . All you need to do is worry over your eyesight . " Crossing the Mary Blaine Scrob 131 " What is it I 'm not to see , then ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the inside of a lockup again , I promise you that . " Burgess turned stubborn . " Speak plain , " he said . Pierce sighed . He reached for the money . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " I fear I must take my business elsewhere . " Burgess caught his hand . " Not overquick , " he said . " I 'm just asking . " " I ca n't tell you . " " You think I 'll blow on you to the crushers ? " " Such things , " Pierce said , " have been known to happen . " " I would n't blow . " Pierce shrugged . There was a moment of silence . Finally , Burgess reached over with his other hand and plucked away the two fivepoundnotes . " Tell me what I do , " he said . " It 's very simple , " Pierce said . " Soon you will be approachedby a man who will ask you whether your wife sews your uniforms . When you meet that man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? " " That 's all . " " For two hundred quid ? " " For two hundred quid . " Burgess frowned for a moment , and then began to laugh . " What 's funny ? " Pierce said . " You 'll never pull it , " Burgess said . " It 's not to be done , that one . There 's no cracking those safes , wherever I look . Few months past , there 's a kid , works into the baggage car , wants to do those safes . Have a go , I says to him , and he has a go for half an hour , and he gets no further than the tip of my nose . Then I threw him off smartly , ' bounced him on his noggin .

CHAPTER 27The Eel-Skinner 's PerplexityEconomists of the mid-Victorian period note that increasing numbers of people made their living by what was then called " dealing , " an inclusive term that referred to supplying goods and services to the burgeoning middle class . England was then the richest nation on earth , and the richest in history . The demand for all kinds of consumer goods was insatiable , and the response was specialization in manufacture , distribution , and sale of goods . It is in Victorian England that one first hears of cabinetmakers who made only the joints of cabinets , and of shops that sold only certain kinds of cabinets . The increasing specialization was apparent in the underworldas well , and nowhere more peculiar than in the figure of the " eel-skinner . " An eel-skinner was usually a metalworkergone bad , or one too old to keep up with the furious pace of legitimate production . In either case , he disappeared from honest circles , re-emerging as a specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a coiner who could not get the stamps to turn out coins . Whatever his background , his principal business was makingeel-skins , or coshes . The earliest eel-skins were sausagelikecanvas bags filled with sand , which rampsmen and gonophs  --  muggers and thieves  --  could carry up their sleevesThe Eel-Skinner 's Perplexity 133until the time came to wield them on their victims . Later , eel-skins were filled with lead shot , and they served the same purpose . An eel-skinner also made other articles . A " neddy " was a cudgel , sometimes a simple iron bar , sometimes a bar with a knob at one end . The " sack " was a two-pound iron shot placed in a strong stocking . A " whippler " was a shot with an attached cord , and was used to disable a victim head on ; the attacker held the shot in his hand and flung it at the victim'sface , " like a horrible yo-yo . " A few blows from these weapons were certain to take the starch out of any quarry , and the robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eel-skinners turned to making bullets . A few skilled eel-skinners also manufactured sets of bettys , or picklocks , but this was demanding work , and most stuck to simpler tasks . In early January , 1855 , a Manchester eel-skinner named Harkins was visited by a gentleman with a red beard who said he wanted to purchase a quantity of LC shot . " Easy enough done , " the skinner said . " I make all manner of shot , and I can make LC right enough . How much will you have ? " " Five thousand , " the gentleman said . " I beg pardon ? " " I said , I will have five thousand LC shot . " The eel-skinner blinked . " Five thousand  --  that 's a quantity . That 's  --  let 's see  --  six LC to the ounce . Now , then . . . " He stared up at the ceiling and plucked at his lower lip . " And sixteen . . . now , that makes it . . . Bless me , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe so , " the gentleman said . " You want fifty pounds of LC shot ? " " I want five thousand , yes . " " Well , fifty pounds of lead , that 'll take some doing , and the casting  --  well , that 'll take some doing . That 'll take some time , five thousand LC shot will , some time indeed . " 134 ' THE KEYS " I need it in a month , " the gentleman said . " A month , a month ... Let 's see , now ... casting at a hundred a mold . . . Yes , well . . . " The eel-skinner nodded . " Right enough , you shall have five thousand within a month . You 'll be collecting it ? " " I will , " the gentleman said , and then he leaned closer , in a conspiratorial fashion . " It 's for Scotland , you know . " " Scotland , eh ? " " Yes , Scotland . " " Oh , well , yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the reverse was clearly true . The red-bearded man put down a deposit and departed , leaving the eel-skinner in a state of marked perplexity . He would have been even more perplexed to know that this gentleman had visited skinners in Newcastle-on-Tyne , Birmingham , Liverpool , and London , and placed identical orders with each of them , so that he was ordering a total of two hundred and fifty pounds of lead shot . What use could anyone have for that ? C H A P T E R 2 8 The Finishing Touch London at the mid-century had six morning newspapers , three evening newspapers , and twenty influential weeklies . This period marked the beginning of an organized press with enough power to mold public opinion and , ultimately , politi- cal events . The unpredictability of that power was highlighted in January , 1855 . On the one hand , the first war correspondent in history , William Howard Russell , was in Russia with the Crimean The Finishing Touch 135troo s , and his dispatches to the Times had aroused furious indignation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bungling of the Balaclava campaign , the devastating winter when British troops , lacking food and medical supplies , suffered a 50 percent mortality  --  these were all reported in the press to an increasingly angry public . By January , however , the commander of British forces , Lord Raglan , was severely ill , and Lord Cardigan  --  " haughty , rich , selfish and stupid , " the man who had bravely led his Light Brigade to utter disaster , and then returned to his yacht to drink champagne and sleep  --  Lord Cardigan had returned home , and the press everywhere hailed him as a great nationalhero . It was a role he was only too happy to play . Dressed in the uniform he had worn at Balaclava , he was mobbed by crowds in every city ; hairs from his horse 's tail were plucked for souvenirs . London shops copied the woolen jacket he had worn in the Crimea  --  called a " Cardigan "  --  and thousands were sold . The man known to his own troops as " the dangerous ass " went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge ; and as the months passed , he spoke with more and more emotion , and was often forced to pause and revive himself . The press never ceased to cheer him on ; there was no sense of the chastisement that later historianshave richly accorded him . But if the press was fickle , public tastes were even more so . Despite all the provocative news from Russia , the dispatcheswhich most intrigued Londoners in January concerneda man-eating leopard that menaced Naini Tal in northern India , not far from the Burmese border . The " Panar man-eater " was said to have killed more than four hundred natives , and accounts were remarkable for their vivid , even lurid , detail . " The vicious Panar beast , " wrote one correspondent , " kills for the sake of killing and not for any food . It rarely eats any portion of the body of its victims , although two weeks past it ate the upper torso of an infant after steal-136 THE KEYS The Finishing Touch 137ing it from its crib . Indeed , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten who are unfortunate enough to stray from the center of the village after nightfall . Adult victims are generally mauled and later die of suppuratingwounds ; Mr. Redby , a hunter of the region , says these infections are caused by rotten flesh lodged in the beast 's claws . The Panar killer is exceedingly strong , and has been seen to carry off a fully grown female adult in its jaws , while the victim struggles and cries out most piteously . " These and other stories became the delicious talk of dining rooms among company given to raciness ; women colored and tittered and exclaimed , while men  --  especially Company men who had spent time in India  --  spoke knowledgeably about the habits of such a beast , and its nature . An interesting working model of a tiger devouring an Englishman , owned by the East India Company , was visited by fascinated crowds . ( The model can still be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum . ) And when , on February 17 , 1855 , a caged , fully grown leopard arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  much more than the arrival , a short time previously , of armed guards carrying strongboxes of gold , which were loaded into the sER luggage van . Here was a full-sized , snarling beast , which roared and charged the bars of its cage as it was loaded onto the same luggage van of the London-Folkestone train . The animal 's keeper accompanied the beast , in order to look after the leopard 's welfare , and to protect the luggage-van guard in the event of any unforeseen mishap . Meanwhile , before the train departed the station , the keeper explained to the crowd of curious onlookers and childrenthat the beast ate raw meat , that it was a female four years old , and that it was destined for the Continent , where it would be a present to a wellborn lady . The train pulled out of the station shortly after eight o'clock , and the guard on the luggage van closed the slidingside door . There was a short silence while the leopard stalked its cage , and growled intermittently ; finally the railway guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animal 's attendant turned to the guard . " Does your wife sew your uniforms ? " he asked . Burgess laughed . " You mean it 's to be you ? " The attendant did not answer . Instead , he opened a small leather satchel and removed a jar of grease , several keys , and a collection of files of varied shapes and sizes . He went immediately to the two Chubb safes , coated the four locks with grease , and began fitting his keys . Burgess watched with only vague interest in the process : he knew that rough-copied wax keys would not work on a finely made safe without polishing and refining . But he was also impressed ; he never thought it would be carried off with such boldness . " Where 'd you make the impressions ? " he said . " Here and there , " Agar replied , fitting and filing . " They keep those keys separate . " " Do they , " Agar said . " Aye , they do . How 'd you pull them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agar said , still working . Burgess watched him for a time , and then he watched the leopard . " How much does he weigh ? " " Ask him , " Agar said irritably . " Are you taking the gold today , then ? " Burgess asked as Agar managed to get one of the safe doors open . Agar did not answer ; he stared transfixed for a moment at the strongboxesinside . " I say , are you taking the gold today ? " Agar shut the door . " No , " he said . " Now stop your voker . " Burgess fell silent . For the next hour , while the morning passenger train chugged from London to Folkestone , Agar worked on his keys . Ultimately , he had opened and closed both safes . When he was finished , he wiped the grease from the locks . Then he cleaned the locks with alcohol and dried them with a cloth . I 3 8 THE KEYSFinally he took his four keys , placed them carefully in his pocket , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folkestone station . Pierce met him at the station and helped to unload the leopard . " How was it ? " he asked . " The finishing touches are done , " Agar said , and then he grinned . " It 's the gold , is n't it ? The Crimean gold  --  that 's the flash pull . " " Yes , " Pierce said . " When ? " " Next month , " Pierce said . The leopard snarled . P A R T I I I March  --  May , 1855CHAPTER 2 9Minor SetbacksThe robbers originally intended to take the gold during the next Crimean shipment . The plan was extremely simple . Pierce and Agar were to board the train in London , each checking several heavy satchels onto the baggage van . The satchels would be filled with sewn packets of lead shot .

Meanwhile , the gold strongboxes  --  still convincingly heavy  --  would be transferred to the steamer going to Ostend , where the theft would be discovered by the French authorities hours later , . By then , enough people would have been involved in the transportation process that there would be no particu- lar reason to fix suspicion on Burgess ; and in any case , British- French relations were at a low level because of the Crimean War , and it would be natural that the French would assume the English had carried out the theft , and vice versa . The robbers could count on plenty of confusion to muddy the waters for the police . The plan seemed utterly foolproof , and the robbers pre- pared to carry it out on the next gold shipment , scheduled for March 14 , 1 855 . On March 2nd , " that fiend in human shape , " Czar Nicho-142 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES las I of Russia , died suddenly . News of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For sev- era ! days the reports were doubted , and when his death was finally confirmed , the stock markets of Paris and London re-respondedwith large gains . But as a result of the general uncer- tainty the gold shipment was delayed until March 27th . By then , Agar , who had sunk into a kind of depression after the fourteenth , was desperately ill with an exacerbation of his chest condition , and so the opportunity was missed . The firm of Huddleston &; Bradford was making gold ship- ments once a month ; there were now only 11,000 English troops in the Crimea , as opposed to 78,000 French , and most of the money was paid out directly from Paris . Thus Pierce and his compatriots were obliged to wait until April . The next shipment was set for April 19th . The robbers at this time were getting their information on shipment sched- ules from a tart named Susan Lang , a favorite of Henry Fowler 's . Mr. Fowler liked to impress the simple girl with episodes reflecting his importance to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor girl  --  who could hardly have understood a word he said  --  seemed endlessly fascinated by everything he told her . Susan Lang was hardly simple , but somehow she got her facts wrong : the gold went out on April 18th , and when Pierce and Agar arrived at London Bridge Station in time to board the April 19th train , Burgess informed them of their error . To maintain appearances , Pierce and Agar made the trip anyway , but Agar testified in court that Pierce was in " very ugly humor indeed " during the journey . The next shipment was scheduled for May 22nd . In order to prevent any further snags , Pierce took the rather risky step of opening a line of communication between Agar and Burgess . Burgess could reach Agar at any time through an intermediary , a betting-shop proprietor named Smashing . Billy Banks ; and Burgess was to get in touch with Banks if thereMinor Setbacks 143was any change in the planned routine . Agar would check with Banks daily . On May loth , Agar returned to Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been removed from the South Eastern Railway 's luggage van and returned to the manufacturer , Chubb , for " overhaul . " " Overhaul ? " Pierce said . " What do you mean , overhaul ? " Agar shrugged . " That was tk cant . " " Those are the finest safes in the world , " Pierce said . " They do n't go back for an overhaul . " He frowned . " What 's wrong with them ? " Agar shrugged . " You bastard , " Pierce said , " did you scratch the locks when you put on your finishing touches ? I swear , if someone 's cooled your scratches  --  " " I greased her lovely , " Agar said . " I know they look as a routine for scratches . I tell you , she had nary a tickle on her . " Agar 's calm demeanor convinced Pierce ; that the screwsmanwas telling the truth . Pierce sighed . " Then why ? " " I do n't know , " Agar said . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " Pierce said . " And I would n't want to try a cross . They 're not gulle'l at Chubb 's . " The safemaker 's firm was unusually careful about its employees . Men were hired and fired only with reluctance , and they were continually warned to look for underworld figures who might try to bribe them . " A little magging , then ? " Agar suggested , meaning some conning . Pierce shook his head . " Not me , " he said . " They 're just too careful ; I 'd never be able to slip it to them .... " He stared into the distance thoughtfully . " What is it ? " Agar asked . " I was thinking , " Pierce said , " that they would never suspecta lady . " CHAPTER 30A Visit to Mr. ChubbWhat Rolls-Royce would become to automobiles , and Otis to elevators , Chubb 's had long since been to safes . The head of that venerable firm , Mr. Laurence Chubb , Jr. , did not later remember  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome young woman in May , 1855 . But an employee of the company was sufficiently impressed by the lady 's beauty to recall her in great detail . She arrived in a handsome coach , with liveried footmen , and swept imperiously into the firm unattended by any escort . She was extremely well dressed and spoke with a commandingmanner ; she demanded to see Mr. Chubb himself , and immediately . When Mr. Chubb appeared a few moments later , the woman announced that she was Lady Charlotte Simms ; that she and her invalid husband maintained a country estate in the Midlands , and that recent episodes of thievery in the neighborhood had convinced her that she and her husband needed a safe . " Then you have come to the best shop in Christendom , " said Mr. Chubb . " So I have been previously informed , " Lady Charlotte said , as if not at all convinced . " Indeed , Madam , we manufacture the finest safes in the world , and in all sizes and varieties , and these excel even the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chubb 145 " I see . " " What is it , specifically , that Madam requires ? " Here Lady Charlotte , for all her imperiousness , seemed to falter . She gestured with her hands . " Why , just some manner of , ah , large safe , you know . " " Madam , " said Mr. Chubb severely , " we manufacture single-thickness and double-thickness safes ; steel safes and iron safes ; lock safes and throwbolt safes ; portable safes and fixed safes ; safes with a capacity of six cubic inches and safes with a capacity of twelve cubic yards ; safes mounted with single locks and double locks  --  and triple locks , should the customer require it . " This recitation seemed to put Lady Charlotte even further off her form . She appeared nearly helpless  --  quite the ordinary way of a female when asked to deal with technical matters . " Well , " she said , " I , ah , I do n't know . . . " " Perhaps if Madam looks through our catalogue , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our different models . " " Yes , excellent , that would be fine . " " This way , please . " Mr. Chubb led her into his office and seated her by his desk . He drew out the catalogue and opened it to the first page . Th'e woman hardly looked at it . " They seem rather small . " " These are only pictures , Madam . You will notice that the true dimensions are stated beside each . For example , here  --  " " Mr. Chubb , " she interrupted , in an earnest tone , " I must beg your assistance . The fact is that my husband is recently ill , or he should be conducting this business for himself . In truth , I know nothing of these matters , and should press my own brother into my assistance were he not at this very minute abroad on business . I am quite at a loss and I can tell nothing from pictures . Can you perhaps show me some of your safes ? " " Madam , forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; DIFFICULTIES A Visit to Mr. Chubb 147desk to help her to her feet . " Absolutely , of course . We maintainno showroom , as you might imagine , but if you will follow me into the workrooms  --  and I heartily apologize for any dust , noise , or commotion you may suffer  --  I can show you the various safes we make . " He led Lady Charlotte back into the long workroom behind the offices . Here a dozen men were busy hammering , fitting , welding , and soldering . The noise was so loud that Mr. Chubb had to shout for Lady Charlotte to hear , and the good woman herself fairly winced from the din . " Now , this version here , " he said , " has a one-cubic-foot capacity , and is double-layered , sixteenth-inch tempered steel , with an insulating layer of dried brick dust of Cornish origin . It is an excellent intermediate safe for many purposes . " " It is too small . " " Very good , Madam , too small . Now , this one here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our most recent creations . It is a single layer of eighth-inch steel with an inner hinge and a capacity of  --  " He turned to the workman : " What is the capacity ? " " This'un here 's two and a half , " the workman said . " Two and a half cubic feet , " Mr. Chubb said . " Still too small . " " Very good , Madam . If you will come this way , " and he led her deeper into the workroom . Lady Charlotte coughed delicately in a cloud of brick dust . " Now , this model here  --  " Mr. Chubb began . " There ! " said Lady Charlotte , pointing across the room . " That 's the size I want . " " You mean those two safes over there ? " " Yes , those . " They crossed the room . " These safes , " said Mr. Chubb , " represent the finest examples of our workmanship . They are owned by the Huddleston &; Bradford Bank , and are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost . However , these are generally sold to institutions , and not to private individuals . I naturally thought  --  " " This is the safe I want , " she said , and then looked at them suspiciously . " They do n't appear very new . " " Oh , no , Madam , they are nearly two years old now . " This seemed to alarm Lady Charlotte . " Two years old . Why are they back ? Have they some defect ? " " No , indeed . A Chubb safe has no defects . They have merely been returned for replacement of the undercarriage mounting pins . Two of them have sheared . You see , they travel on the railway , and the vibration from the roadbed works on the bolts which anchor the safes to the luggage-van floor . " He shrugged . " These details need not concern you . There is nothing wrong with the safes , and we are making no alterations . We are merely replacing the anchor bolts . " " Now I see these have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking firm requested double-lock mechanisms . As I believe I mentioned , we also install triple locks if the customer requires it . " Lady Charlotte peered at the locks . " Three seems excessive . It must be rather a bore to turn three locks just to open a safe . These locks are burglarproof ? " " Oh , absolutely . So much so that in two years no villain has ever even attempted to break these locks . It would be quite hopeless , in any case . These safes are double-layered eighth-inch tempered steel . There is no breaking these . " Lady Charlotte peered thoughtfully at the safes for some moments , and finally nodded . " Very well , " she said , " I shall take one . Please have it loaded into my carriage outside . " " I beg pardon ? " " I said I shall take one safe such as these I see here . It is precisely what I need . " " Madam , " Mr. Chubb said patiently , " we must construct the safe to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have none for sale ? " " None already built , no , Madam , I am very sorry . Each safe is specially built to the customer 's specifications . " Lady Charlotte appeared quite irritated . " Well , can I have one tomorrow morning ? " Mr. Chubb gulped . " Tomorrow morning  --  um , well , as a rule , Madam , we require six weeks to construct a safe . On occasion we can manufacture one as quickly as four weeks , but  --  " " Four weeks ? That is a month . " " Yes , Madam . " " I wish to purchase a safe today . " " Yes , Madam , quite . But as I have attempted to explain , each safe must be built , and the shortest time  --  " " Mr. Chubb , you must think me an utter fool . Well , I shall disabuse you of the notion . I have come here for the purpose of buying a safe , and now I discover you have none to sell  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary will construct one for me in only a month 's time . Within a month the brigands of the neighborhoodwill very probably have come and gone , and your safe will not in the least interest me , or my husband . I shall take my business elsewhere . Good day to you , sir , and thank you for your time . " With that , Lady Charlotte swept out of the firm of Chubb 's . And Mr. Laurence Chubb , Jr. , was heard to mutter in a low voice , " Women . " It was in this fashion that Pierce and Agar learned that the overhaul did not include changing the locks on the safes . That was , of course , all they cared about , and so they made their final preparations for the robbery , which they would carry out on May 22 , 1855 . CHAPTER 31The Snakesman Turns NoseOne week later , their plans were thrown into still further disarray . On May 17 , 1855 , a letter was delivered to Pierce . Written in a graceful and educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be most greatly obliged if you could contrive to meet with me at the Palace , Sydenham , this afternoon at four o'clock , for the purpose of discussing some matters of mutual interest . Most respectfully , I am , William Williams , Esq . Pierce looked at the letter in consternation . He showed it to Agar ; but Agar could not read , so Pierce read the contents aloud . Agar stared at the penmanship . " Clean Willy 's got himself a screever for this one , " he said . " Obviously , " Pierce said . " But why ? " " Perhaps he 's touching you up . " " If that 's all it is , I 'd be happy , " Pierce said . " You going to meet him ? " " Absolutely . Will you crow for me ? " Agar nodded . " You want Barlow ? A good cosh could save a mighty trouble . " " No , " Pierce said . " That 'll set them hounding for sure , a cosh would . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agar said , " a simple crow . ' Two n't be easy in the Palace . " " I 'm sure Willy knows that , " Pierce said gloomily . A word should be said about the Crystal Palace , that magicalstructure which came to symbolize the Victorian midcentury . An enormous three-story glass building covering nineteen acres , it was erected in 1851 in Hyde Park , to house the Great Exhibition of that year , and it impressed every visitor who saw it . Indeed , even in drawings the Crystal Palace is stunning to the modern eye , and to see more than a million square feet of glass shimmering in the afternoon light must have been a remarkable sight for anyone . It is not surprisingthat the Palace soon represented the forward-looking , technological aesthetic of the new industrial Victorian society . But this fabulous structure had a comfortingly haphazard origin . Led by Prince Albert himself , plans for the Great Exhibition began in 1850 , and soon ran into arguments about the proposed Exhibition Hall itself , and its location . Obviously the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of building , and where ? A competition in 1850 attracted more than two hundred designs , but no winner . Thus the Building Committee drew up a plan of its own for a dreadful brick monstrosity ; the structure would be four times as long as Westminster Abbey and boast a dome even larger than that of St. Peter 's . It would be located in Hyde Park . The public balked at the destruction of trees , the inconvenienceto riders , the general ruin of the pleasant neighborhood , and so on . Parliament seemed reluctant to permit Hyde Park to be used as the building site . In the meantime , the Building Committee discovered that their plans required nineteen million bricks . By the summer of 1850 , there was insufficient time to make all these bricks and build the Great Hall in time for the exhibition 's opening . The Snakesman Turns Nose 151There was even some dark talk that the exhibition would have to be canceled , or at least postponed . It was at this point that the Duke of Devonshire 's gardener , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large greenhouse to serve as the Exhibition Hall . His original plan for the committee , drawn up on a piece of blotting paper , was eventually accepted for its several virtues . First , it saved the trees of Hyde Park ; second , its chief material , glass , could be manufactured quickly ; and third , it could be taken down after the exhibition and reinstalled elsewhere . The committee accepted a bid of L79,800 from a contractor to erect the giant structure , which was completed in only seven months , and was later the focal point of almost universal acclaim . Thus the reputation of a nation and an empire was saved by a gardener ; . and thus a gardener was eventually knighted. *After the exhibition , the Great Hall was taken down and moved to Sydenham , in South-East London . In those days , Sydenham was a pleasant suburban area of fine homes and open fields , and the Crystal Palace made an excellent addition to the neighborhood . Shortly before four o'clock , Edward Pierce entered the vast structure to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits , the most impressive being full-scale reproductions of the huge Egyptianstatues of Ramses II at Abu Simbel . But Pierce paid no attention to these attractions , or to the lily ponds and pools of water everywhere about . A brass band concert was in progress ; Pierce saw Clean Willy sitting in one of the rows to the left . He also saw Agar , * There was only one unforeseen problem with the Crystal Palace . The building contained trees , and the trees contained sparrows , and the sparrows were not housebroken . It was really no laughing matter , especially as the birds could n't be shot , and they ignored traps set for them . Finally the Queen herself was consulted , and she said , " Send for the Duke of Wellington . " The Duke was informed of the problem . " Try sparrow hawks , Ma'am , " he suggested , and he was once more victorious. 152 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES disguised as a retired army officer , apparently snoozing in an- other corner . The band played loudly . Pierce slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Pierce said , in a low voice . He looked at the band , and thought idly that he despised band music . " I 'm needing a turn , " Willy said . " You 've been paid . " " I 'm needing more , " Willy said . Pierce shot him a glance . Willy was sweating , and he was edgy , but he did not look nervously around as an ordinary nervous man would do . " You been working , Willy ? " " No . " " You been touched , Willy ? " " No , I swear it , no . " " Willy , " Pierce said , " if you 've turned nose on me , I 'll put you in lavender . " " I swear it , " Willy said . " It 's no flans  --  a finny or two is what I need , and that 's the end of it . " The band , in a moment of patriotic support for England 's allies , struck up the " Marseillaise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection . Pierce said , " You 're sweating , Willy . " " Please , sir , a finny or two and that 'll be the end of it . " Pierce reached into his wallet and withdrew two five- pound notes . " Do n't blow on me , " Pierce said , " or I 'll do what must be done . " " Thank you , sir , thank you , " Willy said , and quickly pocketed the money . " Thank you , sir . " Pierce left him there . As he exited the Palace and came out into the park , he walked quickly to Harleigh Road . There he paused to adjust his top hat . The gesture was seen by Barlow , whose cab was drawn up at the end of the street . Then Pierce walked slowly down Harleigh Road , moving with all appearances of casualness , as a relaxed gent taking Minor Incidents 153the air . His thoughts , whatever they might have been , were interrupted by the wail of a railroad whistle , and a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansions , he saw black smoke puffing into the air . Automatically , he checked his watch : it was the mid-afternoon train of the South Eastern Railway , coming back from Folkestone , going toward London Bridge Station . CHAPTER 32 , Minor IncidentsThe train continued on toward London , and so did Mr. Pierce . At the end of Harleigh Road , near St. Martin 's Church , he hailed a cab and rode it into town to Regent Street , where he got out . Pierce walked along Regent Street ' casually , never once glancing over his shoulder , but pausing frequently to look in the shopwindows along the street , and to watch the reflectionsin the glass . He did not like what he saw , but he was wholly unpreparedfor what he next heard as a familiar voice cried out , " Edward , dear Edward ! " Groaning inwardly , Pierce turned to see Elizabeth Trent . She was shopping , accompanied by a livery boy , who carriedbrightly wrapped packages . Elizabeth Trent colored deeply . " I  --  why , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so pleased to see you , " Pierce said , bowing and kissingher hand. 154 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES " I  --  yes , I  --  " She snatched her hand away and rubbed it with her other . " Edward , " she said , taking a deep breath . " Edward , I did not know what had become of you . " " I must apologize , " Pierce said smoothly . " I was very suddenlycalled abroad on business , and I am sure my letter from Paris was inadequate to your injured sensibilities . " " Paris ? " she said , frowning . " Yes . Did you not receive my letter from Paris ? " " Why , no . " " Damn ! " Pierce said , and then immediately apologized for his strong language . " It is the French , " he said ; " they are so ghastly inefficient . If only I had known , but I never suspected  --  and when you did not reply to me in Paris , I assumed that you were angry .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she began , and broke off . " But when did you return ? " " Just three days past , " Pierce said . " How strange , " Elizabeth Trent said , with a sudden look of unfeminine shrewdness , " for Mr. Fowler was to dinner a fortnight past , and spoke of seeing you . " " I do not wish to contradict a business associate of your father 's , but Henry has the deplorable habit of mixing his dates . I 've not seen him for nearly three months . " Pierce quickly added : " And how is your father ? " " My father ? Oh , my father is well , thank you . " Her shrewdness was replaced by a look of hurt confusion . " Edward , I  --  My father , in truth , spoke some rather unflattering words concerning your character . " " Did he ? " " Yes . He called you a cad . " She sighed . " And worse . " " I wholly understand , given the circumstances , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sudden determination , " since you are returned to England , I trust we shall be seeing you at the house once more . " Here it was Pierce 's turn to be greatly discomfited . " MyMinor Incidents 155dear Elizabeth , " he said , stammering . " I do not know how to say this , " and he broke off , shaking his head . It seemed that tears were welling up in his eyes . " When I did not hear from you in Paris , I naturally assumed that you were displeased with me , and . . . well , as time passed . . . " Pierce suddenly straightened . " I regret to inform you that I am betrothed . " Elizabeth Trent stared . Her mouth fell open . " Yes , " Pierce said , " it is true . I have liven my word . " " But to whom ? " " To a French lady . " " A French lady ? " " Yes , I fear it is true , all true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do see , sir , " she snapped , and turned abruptly on her heel and walked away . Pierce remained standing on the sidewalk , trying to appear as abject as possible , until she had climbed into her carriage and driven off . Then he continued down Regent Street . Anyone who observed him might have noticed that at the bottom of Regent Street there was nothing about his manner or carriage that indicated the least remorse . He boarded a cab to Windmill Street , where he entered an accommodation house that was a known dolly-mop 's lurk , but one of the better class of such establishments . In the plush velvet hallway , Miss Miriam said , " He 's upstairs . Third door on the right . " Pierce went upstairs and entered a room to find Agar seated , chewing a mint . " Bit late , " Agar said . " Trouble ? " " I ran into an old acquaintance . " Agar nodded vaguely . " What did you see ? " Pierce said . " I cooled two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice-like . One 's a crusher in disguise ; the other 's dressed as a squareriggedsport . Followed you all the way down Harleigh , and took a cab when you climbed aboard . " 156 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES Pierce nodded . " I saw the same two in Regent Street . " " Probably lurking outside now , " Agar said . " How 's Willy ? " " Willy looks to be turning nose , " Pierce said . " Must have done a job . " Pierce shrugged . " What 's to be done with Willy , then ? " " He 'll be getting what any gammy trasseno gets . " " I 'd bump him , " Agar said . " I do n't know about bumping , " Pierce said , " but he wo n't have another chance to blow on us . " " What 'll you do with the officers ? " " Nothing for the moment , " Pierce said . " I 've got to think a bit . " And he sat back , lit a cigar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days away , and the police were on to him . If Willy had sung , and loudly , then the police would know that Pierce 's gang had broken into the London Bridge Terminus offices . " I need a new lay , " he said , and stared at the ceiling . " A proper flash lay for the miltonians to discover . " He watched the cigar smoke curl upward , and frowned . C H A P T E R 3 3 Miltonians on the Stalk The institutions of any society are interrelated , even those which appear to have completely opposite goals . Gladstone himself observed : " There is often , in the course of this way- ward and bewildered life , exterior opposition , and sincere and even violent condemnation , between persons and bodies Miltonians on the Stalk 157who are nevertheless profoundly associated by ties and relationsthat they know not of . " Perhaps the most famous example of this , and one wellrecognizedby Victorians , was the bitter rivalry between the temperance societies and the pubs . These two institutions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt the same attractions : the pubs acquired organs , hymn singing , and soft drinks , and the temperance meetings had professional entertainers and a new , raucous liveliness . By the time the temperance groups began buying pubs in order to turn them dry , the intermixture of these two hostile forces became pronouncedindeed . Victorians also witnessed another rivalry , centering around a new social institution  --  the organized police force . Almost immediately , the new force began to form relationships with its avowed enemy , the criminal class . These relationships were much debated in the nineteenth century , and they continue to be debated to the present day . The similarity in methods of police and criminals , as well as the fact that many policemen were former criminals  --  and the reverse  --  were features not overlooked by thinkers of the day . And it was also noted by Sir James Wheatstone that there was a logical problem inherent in a law-enforcement institution , " for , should the police actually succeed in eliminating all crime , they will simultaneously succeed in eliminating themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force or power will ever eliminate itself willingly . " In London , the Metropolitan Police , founded by Sir Robert Peel in 1829 , was headquartered in a district known as ScotlandYard . Scotland Yard was originally a geographical term , denoting an area of Whitehall that contained many governmentbuildings . These buildings included the official residenceof the surveyor of works to the crown , which was occupied by Inigo Jones , and later by Sir Christopher Wren . John Milton lived in Scotland Yard when he was working fo l ver  --  Cromwell from 1649 to 1651 , and it is apparently158 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES from this association that a slang reference for police , two hundred years later , was " miltonian . " When Sir Robert Peel located the new Metropolitan Police in Whitehall , the correct address for the headquarters was No. 4 Whitehall Place , but the police station there had an entrance from Scotland Yard proper , and the press always referred to the police as Scotland Yard , until the term be- came synonymous with the force itself . Scotland Yard grew rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1,000 , but a decade later it was 3,350 , and by 185o it was more than 6,000 , and would increase to io , 000 by 1870 . The task of the Yard was extraordinary : it was called upon to police crime in an area of nearly seven hun- dred square miles , containing a population of two and a half million people . From the beginning , the Yard adopted a posture of defer- ence and modesty in its manner of solving crimes ; the offi- cial explanations always mentioned lucky breaks of one sort or another  --  an anonymous informant , a jealous mistress , a surprise encounter  --  to a degree that was hard to believe . In fact , the Yard employed informers and plainclothesmen , and these agents were the subject of heated debate for the now familiar reason that many in the public feared that an agent might easily provoke a crime and then arrest the participants . Entrapment was a hot political issue of the day , and the Yard was at pains to defend itself . In 1855 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensible lawyer , " who had done much to improve the public attitude toward the Metropolitan Police . Directly under him was Mr. Edward Harranby , and it was Harranby who oversaw the ticklish business of working with under- cover agents and informers . Usually Mr. Harranby kept ir- regular hours ; he avoided contact with the press , and from his office could be seen strange figures coming and going , often at night . Miltonians on the Stalk 159In the late afternoon of May 17th , Harranby had a conversation with his assistant , Mr. Jonathan Sharp . Mr. Harranbyreconstructed the conversation in his memoirs , Days on the Force , published in 1879 . The conversation must be taken with some reservations , for in that volume Harranby was attempting to explain why he did not succeed in thwartingPierce 's robbery plans before they were carried out . Sharp said to him , " The snakesman blew , and we have had a look at our man . " " What sort is he ? " Harranby said . " He appears a gentleman . Probably a cracksman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Manchester , but he lives in a fine house in London . " " Does he know where ? " " He says he 's been there , but he does n't know the exact location . Somewhere in Mayfair . " " We ca n't go knocking on doors in Mayfair , " Harranby said . " Can we assist his powers of memory ? " Sharp sighed . " Possibly . " " Bring him in . I 'll have a talk with him . Do we know the intended crime ? " Sharp shook his head . " The snakesman says he does n't know . He 's afraid of being mizzled , you know , he 's reluctant to blow all he knows . He says this fellow 's planning a flash pull . " Harranby turned irritable . " That is of remarkably little value to me , " he said . " What , exactly , is the crime ? There 's our question , and it begs a proper answer . Who is on this gentleman now ? " " Cramer and Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep them on his trail , and let 's have the nose in my office , and quickly . " " I 'll see to it myself , sir , " the assistant said .

These are the times of greatest frustration , and such was the case of the Robbery of 1855 . " CHAPTER 34The Nose Is CrappedClean Willy , very nervous , was drinking at the Hound 's Tooth pub . He left there about six and headed straight for the Holy Land . He moved swiftly through the evening crowds , then ducked into an alley ; he jumped a fence , slipped into a basement , crossed it , crawled through a passage into an adjoining building , climbed up the stairs , came out onto a narrow street , walked half a block , and disappeared into another house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor , climbed out onto the roof , jumped to an adjacent roof , scrambled up a drainpipe to the third floor of a lodging house , crawled in through a window , and went down the stairs to the basement . Once in the basement , he crawled through a tunnel that brought him out on the opposite side of the street , where he came up into a narrow mews . By a side door , he entered a pub house , the Golden Arms , looked around , and exited from the front door . He walked to the end of the street , and then turned in to the entrance of another lodging house . Immediately he knew that something was wrong ; normally there were children yelling and scrambling all over the stairs , but now the entranceand stairs were deserted and silent . He paused at thedoorway , and was just about to turn and flee when a rope snaked out and twisted around his neck , yanking him into a dark corner . Clean Willy had a look at Barlow , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the garrotting rope . Willy coughed , and struggled , but Barlow 's strength was such that the little snakesman was literally lifted off the floor , his feet kicking in the air , his hands pulling at the rope . This struggle continued for the better part of a minute , and then Clean Willy 's face was blue , and his tongue protrudedgray , and his eyes bulged . He urinated down his pants leg , and then his body sagged . Barlow let him drop to the floor . He unwound the rope from his neck , removed the two five-pound notes from the snakesman 's pocket , and slipped away into the street . Clean Willy 's body lay huddled in a corner and did not move . Many minutes passed before the first of the children reemerged , and approached the corpse cautiously . Then the children stole the snakesman 's shoes , and all his clothing , and scampered away .

Lucky to have jacks on our nancy five days before the pull ? " 162 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES " Yes , lucky , " Pierce said . " What if Willy blew ? He 'd tell them we knocked over the London Bridge Terminus . " " I doubt he 'd blow so much , right off . He 'd likely tickle them for a bigger push . " An informant was in the habit of letting out information bit by bit , with a bribe from the police at each step . " Yes , " Pierce said , " but we must take the chance that he did . Now , that 's why we are lucky . " " Where 's the luck , then ? " Agar said . " In the fact that London Bridge is the only station in the city with two lines operating from it . The South Eastern , and the London &; Greenwich . " " Aye , that 's so , " Agar said , with a puzzled look . " We need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You giving the crushers a slum ? " " They must have something to keep them busy , " Pierce said . " In five days ' time , we 'll pull the peters on that train , and I do n't want the crushers around to watch . " " Where do you want them ? " " I was thinking of Greenwich , " Pierce said . " It would be pleasant if they were in Greenwich . " " So you 're needing a bone nose to pass them the slang . " " Yes , " Pierce said . Agar thought for a moment . " There 's a dolly-mop , Lu- cinda , in Seven Dials . They say she knows one or two mil- tonians  --  dabs it up with them whenever they pinch her , which is often , seeing as how they like the dabbing . " " No , " Pierce said . " They would n't believe a woman ; it 'll look like a feed to them . " " Well , there 's Black Dick , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found about the Queen 's Crown of an evening . " " I know him , " Pierce nodded . " Black Dick 's a lushington , too fond of his gin . I need a true bone nose , a man of the family . " " A man of the family ? Then Chokee Bill will do you proper . " Plucking the Pigeon 163 " Chokee Bill ? That old mick ? " Agar nodded . " Aye , he 's a lag , did a stretch in Newgate . But not for long . " " Oh , yes ? " Pierce was suddenly interested . A shortened prison sentence often implied that the man had made a deal to turn nose , to become an informer . " Got his ticket-of-leave early , did he ? " " Uncommon early , " Agar said . " And the crushers gave him his broker 's license quick-like , too . Very odd , seeing as he 's a mick . " Pawnbrokers were licensed by the police , who shared the usual prejudice against Irishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Pierce said . " Aye , " Agar said . " But they say he deals barkers now and again . And they say he 's a blower . " Pierce considered this at length , and finally nodded . " Where is Bill now ? " " His uncling shop is in Battersea , on Ridgeby Way . " " I 'll see him now , " Pierce said , getting to his feet . " I 'll have a go at plucking the pigeon . " " Do n't make it too easy , " Agar warned . Pierce smiled . " It will take all their best efforts . " He went to the door . " Here , now , " Agar called to him , with a sudden thought . " It just came to me mind : what 's there for a flash pull in Greenwich , of all places ? " " That , " Pierce said , " is the very question the crushers will be asking themselves . " " But is there a pull ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " But what is it , then ? " Pierce shook his head . He grinned at Agar 's perplexed look and left the room . When Pierce came out of the accommodation house , it was twilight . He immediately saw the two crushers lurking164 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES Plucking the Pigeon 165at opposite corners of the street . He made a show of looking nervously about , then walked to the end of the block , where he hailed a cab . He rode the cab several blocks , then jumped out quickly at a busy part of Regent Street , crossed the thoroughfare , and took a hansom going in the opposite direction . To all appearances , he was operating with the utmost cunning . In fact , Pierce would never bother with the crossover fakement to dodge a tail ; it was a glocky ploy that rarely worked , and when he glanced out of the small back window of the hansomcab , he saw that he had not thrown off his pursuers . He rode to the Regency Arms pub house , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side door ( which was in plain view of the street ) , and crossed over to New Oxford Street , where he caught another cab . In the process , he lost one of the crushers , but the other was still with him . Now he proceeded directly across the Thames , to Battersea , to see Chokee Bill . The image of Edward Pierce , a respectable and welldressedgentleman , entering the dingy premises of a Battersea pawnbroker may seem incongruous from a modern perspective . At the time , it was not at all uncommon , for the pawnbrokerserved more than the lower classes , and whomever he served , his function was essentially the same : to act as a sort of impromptu bank , operating more cheaply than established banking concerns . A person could buy an expensive article , such as a coat , and hock it one week to pay the rent ; reclaim it a few days later , for wearing on Sunday ; hock it again on Monday , for a smaller loan ; and so on until there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus filled an important niche in the society , and the number of licensed pawnshops doubled during the mid-Victorian period . Middle-class people were drawn to the broker more for the anonymity of the loan than thecheapness of it ; many a respectable household did not wish it known that some of their silver was uncled for cash . This was , after all , an era when many people equated economic prosperity and good fiscal management with moral behavior ; and conversely , to be in need of a loan implied some kind of misdeed . The pawnshops themselves were not really very shady , although they had that reputation . Criminals seeking fences usually turned to unlicensed , secondhand goods " translators , " who were not regulated by the police and were less likely to be under surveillance . Thus , Pierce entered the door beneath the three balls with impunity . He found Chokee Bill , a red-faced Irishman whose complexiongave the appearance of perpetual near strangulation , sitting in a back corner . Chokee Bill jumped to his feet quickly , recognizing the dress and manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Good evening , " Pierce said . " How may I be serving you , sir ? " Pierce looked around the shop . " Are we alone ? " " We are , sir , as my name is Bill , sir . " But Chokee Bill got a guarded look in his eyes . " I am looking to make a certain purchase , " Pierce said . As he spoke , he adopted a broad Liverpool dockyard accent , though ordinarily he had no trace of it . " A certain purchase ... " " Some items you may have at hand , " Pierce said . " You see my shop , sir , " Chokee Bill said , with a wave of his arm . " All is before you . " " This is all ? " " Aye , sir , whatever you may see . " Pierce shrugged . " I must have been told wrongly . Good evening to you . " And he headed for the door . He was almost there when Chokee Bill coughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 166 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES Pierce looked back at him . " I need certain rare items . " " Rare items , " Chokee Bill repeated . " What manner of rare items , sir ? " " Objects of metal , " Pierce said , looking directly at the pawnbroker . He found all this circumspection tedious , but it was necessary to convince Bill of the genuineness of his transaction . " Metal , you say ? " Pierce made a deprecating gesture with his hands . " It is a question of defense , you see . " " Defense . " " I have valuables , property , articles of worth . . . . And therefore I need defense . Do you take my meaning ? " " I take your meaning , " Bill said . " And I may have such a thing as you require . " " Actually , " Pierce said , looking around the shop again , as if to reassure himself that he was truly alone with the pro- prietor , " actually , I need five . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in astonishment . Now that his secret was out , Pierce became very nervous . " That 's right , " he said , glancing this way and that , " five is what I need . " " Five 's a goodly number , " Bill said , frowning . Pierce immediately edged toward the door . " Well , if you ca n't snaffle them  --  " " Wait , now , " Bill said , " I 'm not saying ca n't . You never heard me say ca n't . All 's I said is five is a goodly number , which it is , right enough . " " I was told you had them at hand , " Pierce said , still nervous . " I may . " " Well , then , I should like to purchase them at once . " Chokee Bill sighed . " They 're not here , sir  --  you can count on that  --  a man does n't keep barkers about in an uncle shop , no , sir . " Plucking the Pigeon 16.7 " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more agitated , Chokee Bill became more calm , more appraising . Pierce could almost see his mind working , thinking over the meaning of a request for five pistols . It implied a major crime , and no mistake . As a blower , he might make a penny or two if he knew the details . " It would be some days , sir , and that 's the truth , " Bill said . " I can not have them now ? " " No , sir , you 'd have to give me a space of time , and then I 'll have them for you , right enough . " " How much time ? " There followed a long silence . Bill went so far as to mumbleto himself , and tick off the days on his fingers . " A fortnightwould be safe . " " A fortnight ! " " Eight days , then . " " Impossible , " Pierce said , talking aloud to himself . " In eight days , I must be in Greenw  --  " He broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days is too long . " " Seven ? " Bill asked . " Seven , " Pierce said , staring at the ceiling . " Seven , seven ... seven days . . . Seven days is Thursday next ? " " Aye , sir . " " At what hour on Thursday next ? " " A question of timing , is it ? " Bill asked , with a casualness that was wholly unconvincing . Pierce just stared at him . " I do n't mean to pry , sir , " Bill said quickly . " Then see you do not . What hour on Thursday ? " " Noon . " Pierce shook his head . " We will never come to terms . It is impossible and I  --  " " Here , now  --  here , now . What hour Thursday must it be ? " 168 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES " No later than ten o'clock in the morning . " Chokee Bill reflected . " Ten o'clock here ? " " Yes . " " And no later ? " " Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , to collect them ? " Once again , Pierce gave him a stern look . " That hardlyneed concern you . Can you supply the pieces or not ? " " I can , " Bill said . " But there 's an added expense for the quick service . " " That will not matter , " Pierce said , and gave him ten gold guineas . " You may have this on account . " Chokee Bill looked at the coins , turned them over in his palm . " I reckon this is the half of it . " " So be it . " " And the rest will be paid in kind ? " " In gold , yes . " Bill nodded . " Will you be needing shot as well ? " " What pieces are they ? " " Webley 48-bore , rim-fire , holster models , if my guess is right . " " Then I will need shot . " " Another three guineas for shot , " Chokee Bill said blandly . " Done , " Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A final consideration , " he said . " If , when I arrive Thursday next , the pieces are not waiting , it shall go hard with you . " " I 'm reliable , sir . " " It will go very hard , " Pierce said again , " if you are not . Think on it . " And he left . It was not quite dark ; the street was dimly lit by gas lamps . He did not see the lurking crusher but knew he was there somewhere . He took a cab and drove to Leicester Square , where the crowds were gathering for the evening 's theatrical productions . He entered one throng , bought a ticket for a showing of She Stoops to Conquer , and then lost Scotland Yard Deduces t 69himself in the lobby . He was home an hour later , after three cab changes and four duckings in and out of pubs . He was quite certain he had not been followed . CHAPTER 36 Scotland Yard DeducesThe morning of May t 8th was uncommonly warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather . Things were going very badly , and he had treated his assistant , Mr. Sharp , with notable ill temper when he was informedof the death of the snakesman Clean Willy in a nethersken in Seven Dials . When he was later informed that his tails had lost the gentleman in the theatre crowd  --  a man they knew only as Mr. Simms , with a house in Mayfair  --  Mr. Harranby had flown into a rage , and complained vigorously about the ineptitude of his subordinates , including Mr. Sharp . But Mr. Harranby 's rage was now controlled , for the Yard 's only remaining clue was sitting before him , perspiring profusely , wringing his hands , and looking very red-faced . Harranby frowned at Chokee Bill . " Now , Bill , " Harranby said , " this is a most serious matter . " " I know it , sir , indeed I do , " Bill said . " Five barkers tells me there is something afoot , and I mean to know the truth behind it . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've no doubt , " Harranby said heavily . He fished a gold guinea out of his pocket and dropped it on his desk before him . " Try to recall , " he said . " It was late in the day , sir , with all respects , and I was not170 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIESat my best , " Bill said , staring pointedly at the gold piece . Harranby would be damned if he 'd give the fellow another . " Many a memory improves on the cockchafer , in my experience , " he said . " I 've done no wrong , " Bill protested . " I 'm honest as the day is long , sir , and I 'd keep nothing from you . There 's no call to put me in the stir . " " Then try to remember , " Harranby said , " and be quick about it . " Bill twisted his hands in his lap . " He comes into the shop near six , he does . Dressed proper , with good manner , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voker romeny . " Harranby glanced at Sharp , in the corner . From time to time , even Harranby needed some help in translation . " He had a Liverpool sailor 's accent and he spoke criminal jargon , " Sharp said . " Aye , sir , that 's so , " Bill said , nodding . " He 's in the family , and that 's for sure . Wants me to snaffle five barkers , and I say five 's a goodly number , and he says he wants them quicklike , and he 's nervous , and in a hurry , and he 's showing plenty of ream thickers to pay up on the spot . " " What did you tell him ? " Harranby said , keeping his eyes fixed on Bill . A skilled informant like Chokee Bill was not above playing each side against the other , and Bill could lie like an adept . " I says to him , five 's a goodly number but I can do it in time . And he says how much time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockum for a bit , and then he says he needs it quicker than a fortnight . I says eight days . He says eight days is too long , and he starts to say he 's off to Greenwich in eight days , but then he catches himself , like . " " Greenwich , " Harranby said , frowning . " Aye , sir , Greenwich was on the tip of his tongue , but he stops down and says it 's too long . So I says how long ? And he says seven days . So I says I can translate in seven days . And he says what time of the day ? I say noontime . And heScotland Yard Deduces 171says noontime 's too late . He says no later than ten o'clock . " " Seven days , " Harranby said , " meaning Friday next ? " " No , sir . Thursday next . Seven days from yesterday it was . " " Go on . " " So I says , after a hem and a haw , I says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he says that 's fly enough , but he 's no flat , this one , and he says any gammy cockum and it will go hard on me . " Harranby looked at Sharp again . Sharp said , " The gentlemanis no fool and warned that if the guns were not ready at the arranged time , it would be hard on Bill . " " And what did you say , Bill ? " Harranby inquired . " I says I can do it , and I promise him . And he gives me ten gold pushes , and I granny they 're ream , and he takes his leave and says he 'll be back Thursday next . " " What else ? " Harranby said . " That 's the lot , " Bill said . There was a long silence . Finally Harranby said , " What do you make of this , Bill ? " " It 's a flash pull and no mistake . He 's no muck-snipe , this gent , but a hykey bloke who knows his business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What in Greenwich has the makings of a proper flash pull ? " " Damn me if I know , " Chokee Bill said . " What have you heard ? " Harranby said . " I keep my lills to the ground , but I heard nothing of a pull in Greenwich , I swear . " Harranby paused . " There 's another guinea in it for you if you can say . " A fleeting look of agony passed across Chokee Bill 's face . " I wish I could be helping you , sir , but I heard nothing . It 's God 's own truth , sir . " " I 'm sure it is , " Harranby said . He waited awhile longer , and finally dismissed the pawnbroker , who snatched up the guinea and departed. 172 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES When Harranby was alone with Sharp , he said again , " What 's in Greenwich ? " " Damn me if I know , " Sharp said . " You want a gold guinea , too ? " Sharp said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing to do except ride them out . He sat in the corner and watched his superior light a cigarette and puff on it reflectively . Sharp regarded cigarettes as silly , insubstantial little things . They had been introduced the year before by a London shopkeeper , and were mostly favored by troops returning from the Crimea . Sharp himself liked a good cigar , and nothing less . " Now , then , " Harranby said . " Let us begin from the be- ginning . We know this fellow Simms has been working for months on something , and we can assume he 's clever . " Sharp nodded . " The snakesman was killed yesterday . Does that mean they know we 're on the stalk ? " " Perhaps . " " Perhaps , perhaps , " Harranby said irritably . " Perhaps is not enough . We must decide , and we must do so according to principles of deductive logic . Guesswork has no place in our thinking . Let us stick to the facts of the matter , and follow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we know ? " The question was rhetorical , and Sharp said nothing . " We know , " Harranby said , " that this fellow Simms , after months of preparation , suddenly finds himself , on the eve of his big pull , in desperate need of five barkers . He has had months to obtain them quietly , one at a time , creating no stir . But he postpones it to the last minute . Why ? " " You think he 's playing us for a pigeon ? " " We must entertain the thought , however distasteful , " Harranby said . " Is it well known that Bill 's a nose ? " " Perhaps . " " Damn your perhapses . Is it known or not ? " Scotland Yard Deduces 173 " Surely there are suspicions about . " " Indeed , " Harranby said . " And yet our clever Mr. Simms chooses stared moodily at the glowing tip of his cigarette . " This Mr. Simms is deliberately leading us astray , and we must not follow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , hoping his boss 's disposition would improve . " Without question , " Harranby said . " We are being led a merry chase . " There was a long pause . Harranby drummed his fingers on the desk . " I do n't like it . We are being too clever . We 're giving this Simms fellow too much credit . We must assume he is really planning on Greenwich . But what in the name of God is there in Greenwich to steal ? " Sharp shook his head . Greenwich was a seaport town , but it had not grown as rapidly as the larger ports of England . It was chiefly known for its naval observatory , which maintained the standard of time  --  Greenwich Mean Time  --  for the nauticalworld . Harranby began opening drawers in his desk , rummaging . " Where is the damned thing ? " " What , sir ? " " The schedule , the schedule , " Harranby said . " Ah , here it is . " He brought out a small printed folder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah . Thursdays there is a train leaving London Bridge Terminus for Greenwich at eleven-fifteen in the morning . Now , what does that sug-gest ? " Sharp looked suddenly bright-eyed . " Our man wants his guns by ten , so that he will have time to get to the station and make the train . " " Precisely , " Harranby said . " All logic points to the fact that he is , indeed , going to Greenwich on Thursday . And we also know he can not go later than Thursday . " Sharp said , " What about the guns ? Buying five at once . " 174 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIES " Well , now , " Harranby said , warming to his subject , " you see , by a process of deduction we can conclude that his need for the guns is genuine , and his postponing the purchase to the last minute  --  on the surface , a most suspicious business  --  springs from some logical situation . One can surmise several . His plans for obtaining the guns by other means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of guns as dangerous  --  which is certainly the case ; everyone knows we pay well for information about who is buying barkers  --  so he postpones it to the last moment . There may be other reasons we can not guess at . The exact reason does not matter . What matters is that he needs those guns for some criminalactivity in Greenwich . " " Bravo , " Sharp said , with a show of enthusiasm . Harranby shot him a nasty look . " Do n't be a fool , " he said , " we are little better off than when we began . The principal question still stands before us . What is there to steal in Green-wich ? " Sharp said nothing . He stared at his feet . He heard the scratch of a match as Harranby lit another cigarette . " All is not lost , " Harranby said . " The principles of deductivelogic can still aid us . For example , the crime is probably a robbery . If it has been planned for many months , it must figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is no casual , off-the-cuff snatch . " Sharp continued to stare at his feet . " No , indeed , " Harranby said . " There is nothing casual about it . Furthermore , we may deduce that this lengthy planningis directed toward a goal of some magnitude , a major crime with high stakes . In addition , we know our man is a seafaring person , so we may suspect his crime has something to do with the ocean , or dockyard activities in some way . Thus we may limit our inquiry to whatever exists in the town of Greenwich that fits our  --  " Sharp coughed . Scotland Yard Deduces 175Harranby frowned at him . " Do you have something to say ? " " I was only thinking , sir , " Sharp said , " that if it is Greenwich , it 's out of our jurisdiction . Perhaps we ought to telegraphthe local police and warn them . " " Perhaps , perhaps . When will you learn to do without that word ? If we were to cable Greenwich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say in our cable ? " " I was only thinking  --  " " Good God , " Harranby said , standing up behind his desk . " Of course ! The cable ! " " The cable ? " " Yes , of course , the cable . The cable is in Greenwich , even as we speak . " " Do you mean the Atlantic cable ? " Sharp asked . " Certainly , " Harranby said , rubbing his hands together . " Oh , it fits perfectly . Perfectly ! " Sharp remained puzzled . He knew , of course , that the proposedtransatlantic telegraph cable was being manufactured in Greenwich ; the project had been under way for more than a year , and represented one of the most considerable technological efforts of the time . There were already underseacables in the Channel , linking England to the Continent . But these were nothing compared to the twenty-five hundred miles of cable being constructed to join England to New York . " But surely , " Sharp said , " there is no purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harranby said . " The payroll for the firm . What is it ? Glass , Elliot &; Company , or some such . An enormousproject , and the payroll must be equal to the undertaking . That 's our man 's objective . And if he is in a hurry to leave on Thursday , he wishes to be there on Friday  --  " " Payday ! " Sharp cried . " Exactly , " Harranby said . " It is entirely logical . You see176 DELAYS &; DIFFICULTIESthe process of deduction carried to its most accurate concluSion . " Congratulations , " Sharp said cautiously . " A trifle , " Harranby said . He was still very excited , and clapped his hands together . " Oh , he is a bold one , our friend Simms . To steal the cable payroll  --  what an audacious crime ! And we shall have him red-handed . Come along , Mr. Sharp . We must journey to Greenwich , and apprise ourselves of the situation at first hand . " CHAPTER 37 Further Congratulations " And then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train .

" Nothing cango wrong now . " Pierce sat back in a chair . " Something can always go wrong , " he said , but he was smiling . " In four days ? " she asked . " Even in the space of an hour . " Later , in his courtroom testimony , Pierce admitted he was astounded at how prophetic his own words were , for enormousdifficulties lay ahead  --  and they would come from the most unlikely source . CHAPTER 38 A Sharp Business PracticeHenry Mayhew , the- great observer , reformer , and classifier of Victorian society , once listed the various types of criminals in England . The list had five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than a hundred separate entries . To the modern eye , the list is remarkable for the absence of any consideration of what is now called " white-collar crime . " Of course , such crime existed at that time , and there were some flagrant examples of embezzlement , forgery , false accounting , bond manipulation , and other illegal practices that came to light during the mid-century . In 1850 , an insurance clerk named Walter Watts was caught after he embezzled more than  --  70,000 , and there were several crimes much larger : Leopold Redpath 's  --  150,000 in forgeries on the Great Northern Railway Company , and Beaumont Smith 's  --  350,000 in counterfeit exchequer bonds , to name two examples . Then , as now , white-collar crime involved the largest sums of money , was the least likely to be detected , and was punishedmost leniently if the participants were ever apprehended . Yet Mayhew 's list of criminals ignores this sector of crime entirely . For Mayhew , along with the majority of his contemporaries , was firmly committed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , " and that criminal behavior sprang from poverty , injustice , oppression , and lack of education . It was almost a matter of definition : a person who was not from the criminal class could not be committing a crime . Persons of a better station were merely " breaking the law . " Several factors unique to the Victorian attitude toward upper-class crime contributed to this belief . First , in a newly capitalistic society , with thousands of emerging businesses , the principles of honest accounting were not firmly established , and accounting methods were understoodto be even more variable than they are today . A man might , with a fairly clear conscience , blur the distinction between fraud and " sharp business practices . " Second , the modern watchdog of all Western capitalist countries , the government , was nowhere near so vigilant then . Personal incomes below  --  150 annually were not taxed , and the great majority of citizens fell beneath this limit . ThoseA Sharp Business Practice I 179who were taxed got off lightly by modern standards , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hint yet of the modern citizen 's frantic scrambleto arrange his finances in such a way as to avoid as much tax as possible . ( In 187o , taxes amounted to 9 percent of the gross national product of England ; in 1961 , they were 38 percent . ) Furthermore , the Victorians of all classes accepted a kind of ruthlessness in their dealings with one another that seems outrageous today . To take an example , when Sir John Hall , the physician in charge of the Crimean troops , decided to get rid of Florence Nightingale , he elected to starve her out by ordering that her food rations be halted . Such vicious maneuverswere considered ordinary by everyone ; Miss Nightingaleanticipated it , and carried her own supplies of food , and even Lytton Strachey , who was hardly disposed to view the Victorians kindly , dismissed this incident as " a trick . " If this is only a trick , it is easy to see why middle-class observers were reluctant to label many kinds of wrongdoing as " crimes " ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the reluctance . A case in point is Sir John Alderston and this crate of wine . Captain John Alderston was knighted after Waterloo , in 1815 , and in subsequent years he became a prosperous Londoncitizen . He was one of the owners of the South Eastern Railway from the inception of the line , and had large financialholdings in several coal mines in Newcastle as well . He was , according to all accounts , a portly , tart-spoken gentleman who maintained a military bearing all his life , barking out terse commands in a manner that was increasingly ludicrousas his waistline spread with the passing years .
