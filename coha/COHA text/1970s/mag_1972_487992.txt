In the spring of 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson misled the Congress and the American people about the cost of the war in Vietnam and the consequent need for increased taxes . Because Johnson did not want the country to know that it was facing a big war , lest the knowledge jeopardize his Great Society ' programs , his administration made every effort to hide burgeoning military expenditures . And as official estimates of what- the war would cost became increasingly unreliable  --  falling short by $6 billion in fiscal 1966 and by $11 billion in fiscal 1967 ? the President 's economic advisers , worried about inflation , since unemployment was dropping toward 4 per cent , urged the President to tell the country it needed a tax hike . He disagreed , saying : " I do n't know much about economics . . . . But if I talk about the cost of the war , the Great Society wo n't go through and the ' tax bill wo n't go through . Old Wilbur Mills will sit down there and he 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for the war . " - While this may have seemed only a small deceit to the President at the time , it is difficult to exaggerate ' the longterm harm done to the American economy . Johnson 's refusal to level with the public led to a $25 billion deficit . in fiscal 1968 , a major distortion of national , priorities , the unleashing of a pernicious inflation that is still with us ; and the eventual establishment by President Nixon of a system of economic controls so radical , that somei have compared it to Lenin 's New Economic Policy of the 1920s . In fact , Johnson 's little white lie was , in David Halberstam 's words , " How the Economy Went Haywire . " With predictable enthusiasm , President Nixon attacked the substantive deficiencies and lack of candor in Lyndon Johnson 's economic policies . The first Nixon Economic Report promised to open the books of government as never before . " We are making available the facts and figures that will enable the people to make some intelligent judgments about the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this nation , we must first improve the quality of debate about our national priorities . . . . Government must say what it means and mean what it says . Economic credibility is the basis for confidence , and confidence in turn is the basis for ongoing prosperity . " A tipoff that this might be a hollow commitment was the cliche about government 's saying what it means and meaning what it says . It is hard to imagine that a President , anguishing over the need for candor in government , would set his pen to writing such stuff . And now , just as Johnson misrepresented the tax issue in 1965 and 1966 , Nixon appears willing to mislead the American people on the state of our federal tax system and the need for tax reform . In slide shows , press releases and even Congressional testimony , the Administration has arranged the facts to fit the point of view that the tax system serves the average citizen so admirably that cries for reform are ill conceived . The Administration 's tax policy was set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury John B. Connally . Rather than be defensive about the Administration 's lack of tax reform proposals , Connally 's strategy was to bluff his way through by going on the offensive and ridiculing the reform proposals of others . The ultimate in this approach was ' reached in April 1972 , while Connally was still Secretary of the Treasury , with a slide show given by Fredrick Hickman , Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy . Armed with a slide presentation , Mr. Hickman reportedly disparaged tax reform as unnecessary and undesirable , saying , " There are more important problems before the nation than reshaping our tax laws . We 're doing pretty well . " Public indignation at what seemed to be an extreme attempt to propagandize the tax issue brought about its early demise . In what must be the world 's shortest run of performances for a theatre event , the slide show opened with a single performance in Washington and closed after a second performance in New York . With sophistication gained from experience , however , the Administration now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the revenue side of the federal budget is efficient and fair . ? Myth Number 1 : The Rich Pay High Taxes . In sustained chorus , spokesmen for the Administration have attempted to halt the growing revolt against taxes by minimizing the extent to which wealthy individuals escape paying their fair share . In mid-summer Edwin S. Cohen , Under Secretary of the Treasury and Nixon 's most knowledgeable tax adviser , instructed members of the Congress : " In the face of political rhetoric , it is important that we keep a proper perspective and consider the need for furtherreform of the tax structure with a calm and deliberate appraisal . " Mr. Cohen 's perspective was that " much has been said in the heat of a political campaign to indicate that the rich somehow manage to avoid paying income taxes . . . . But if we look at the data as a whole it is clear that people with high adjusted gross incomes are paying heavy federal income taxes . " Pointing out that Treasury data showed individuals with adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen contended that critics should be slow to condemn a federal tax system that produces such huge amounts of tax . Mr. Cohen 's statement may reassure someone who does n't know the meaning of adjusted gross income , a lovely Treasury term that deliberately excludes the very loophole income that tax reformers scream about ? capital gains , tax-exempt bonds , depletion , and so on . In other words , the 44 per cent rate presented by Mr. Cohen relates primarily to that portion of a rich man 's income that is not gained from loopholes . " Adjusted gross income " is clearly part of the fable of the tax system that works against reform . Mr. Cohen , himself , although willing to use the term freely in prepared testimony , acknowledged under tough Congressional questioning that " I could not agree more that the use of adjusted gross income as a measurement here has great defects . " Unfortunately , the Under Secretary 's ability to recognize that his prepared presentation had been inadequate was not enough to prevent its widespread acceptance . U.S. News &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared statement , without one word of the criticism or of Cohen 's agreement with it . An article labeled " Who Really Pays Federal Taxes ? Latest Official Report , " encouraged the public to swallow the Administration 's view that , there is little wrong with the tax structure . But actually the federal tax collector is losing his grip on the rich and , near rich . Joseph Pechman and Benjamin Okner of the Brookings Institution , correcting for the erosion of the individual income tax base and the deficiencies of the adjusted gross income measure , estimate that , loopholes now amount to $77 billion a year , an amount that approaches the $87 billion a year the tax collects . While , some of these special privileges also reduce the tax rates of low- and moderate-income taxpayers , the data suggest it is the rich whose rates at reduced the most . Adding in what is missing from the adjusted gross income measure , for example , Pechman and Okner estimate that taxpayers with incomes in excess of $200,000 a year pay an effective rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen 's estimate , and 40 per cent less than IRS maximum for this bracket . And there are still those 104 wealthy Americans who in 1970 achieved the mission impossible of not paying a dime in federal income taxes  --  despite the much heralded 10 per cent minimum income tax enacted in 1969 . Myth Number 2 : The Average Taxpayer Benefits the Most from Tax Loopholes . A corollary to the argument that the wealthy are paying heavy taxes is the Administration-advanced myth that middle-income taxpayers , those making $10,000 to $15,000 a year , are the main beneficiaries of tax loopholes . The point is promoted rhetorically by abundant references to homeowner property tax deductions , the exclusion of Social Security payments , the extra exemption for the blind , and so on . The Treasury cites its own data on the " Estimated Distribution of Selected Items of Tax Preferences of Individuals by Adjusted Gross Income Class , Calendar 1971 , " submitted to the Joint Economic Committee in July , as evidence that the average taxpayer does a pretty good job of getting his share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury handout , however , charging " that the Treasury Department was presenting deliberately misleading statistics to the Congress and the American people in an attempt to undermine the growing pressure for tax reform . " What the Administration left out of its adjusted gross income figures this time , according to the Nader-created group , was any indication about the number of taxpayers in each income group . When those figures are supplied , it becomes clear that most of the special tax breaks smile more broadly on a taxpayer as his income rises . The original Treasury data , for example , showed the deduction for medical expenses to be worth $470 million to the total number of taxpayers earning $10,000 to $15,000 in - 1971 and only $35 million to all those earning $100,000 or more . But these aggregate statistics did not disclose that there were approximately 14 million taxpayers in the first group- and only 78,000 in the latter . Thus , the medical expense deduction was worth only $33 to each taxpayer earning $10,000 to $15,000 as against $499 for taxpayers earning $100,000 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the richest 0.1 per cent of our population realized more than ten times the medical care tax benefits received by the average taxpayer . Even tax breaks that have been traditionally thought of as middle-class loopholes actually benefit the wealthy much more than they do the typical wage earner . For example , the original Treasury data showed that the homeowner property tax deduction was worth $642 million to the $10,000 to $15,000 group and only $137 million to the $100,000-plus group . But when the number of taxpayers is taken into account the pattern is reversed , with benefits of only $45 for the wage earner making $10,000 to $15,000 , but $1,758 for the $100,000-plus highflier  --  a 35-to-1 ratio in favor of the rich . The average taxpayer 's hunch that he is cheated in the tax loophole lottery is correct . Myth Number 3 : Nixon 's Tax Changes Have Not Favored Corporations . Although it is common to hear the charge that the White House favors business , Administradon spokesmen have vigorously argued in speeches and Congressional testimony that tax changes since 1969 have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Tax Institute of New England in April of this year , for example , Treasury Under Secretary Cohen took that position , citing as evidence the changes in absolute dollar amounts paid by corporations and individuals under the Nixon tax policies . Pointing out that aggregate corporate taxes would increase by $5 billion over the period , while aggregate individual income taxes would fall by $19 billion , Cohen claimed , " It can not properly be said that the benefits of the 1969-71 changes have favored corporations as against individuals . Substantially all the reductions have gone to , individuals . " But the absolute dollar technique is a sham as a measure of corporate tax burden . Among other deficiencies , the absolute amount of corporate income taxes collected may increase while corporate income tax rates are declining . If a meaningful judgment of what has happened to income tax burdens is to be made , the focus should be on what proportion corporate income taxes are of pretax profits , or what proportion corporate income taxes are of all federal revenues . As a percentage of pretax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about 41 per cent in 1970 to 37 per cent in 1972 , with projections that it will drop to less than 36 per cent by the end of 1973 . Not too surprisingly , corporate income taxes are also declining as a share of federal revenues . From a high of 23 per cent in 1960 , corporate income taxes gradually declined to 21 per cent by 1969 , and have since then rapidly dropped to 16 per cent . Although it is true that individual income tax rates have also declined over the period , this has been largely offset by an 8 per cent increase in the relatively regressive Social Security tax . It seems evident that corporations have benefited the most from tax changes made since 1969 . But even the erosion of overall corporate income tax rates does not tell the ' whole story . According to a study released by Rep. Charles A. Vanik ( D. , Ohio ) nine of the eighty-six largest industrial corporations in 1970 ? U.S. Steel , Bethlehem Steel , McDonnell Douglas , W. R. Grace , Gulf &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel and National Steel  --  made $682 million in profits but paid nothing in federal taxes . Another thirteen of the top eighty-six corporations had effective tax rates of 1 to 10 per cent , the study showed , even though their profits totaled more than $3 billion . So significant has tax avoidance been among the larger steel , oil , timber and railroad companies that the corporate income tax for the top eighty-six firms has fallen to 24 per cent-20 per cent less than the rate paid by smaller corporations and exactly half the official corporate rate . Mr. Vanik concluded that , although the data were sketchy , it appeared that the situation had deteriorated to the point where giant corporations were even more adept at weaseling out of taxes than wealthy individuals : Great public concern and indignation has been focused on those 107 Americans who received more than $200,000 in income last year yet paid no federal income taxes . But put the facts in perspective : those 107 recently revised to 104 Americans received a total of $26 million tax-free . In 1970 nine corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $682 million  --  yet paid no federal taxes ! Myth Number 4 : Most Tax Subsidies Achieve Important Social Goals . Under attack about the extent to which wealthy individuals and giant corporations escape taxes , the Administration usually retreats to the position that tax loopholes are not giveaways to the rich but subsidies designed to induce the affluent to put their funds into socially useful activities . ' Unfortunately , there is more rhetoric about the worth-while objectives of tax subsidies than there is evidence that they actually accomplish anything . Time and again Administration spokesmen have asserted without proof that the investment credit creates jobs , that rapid depreciation creates new rental housing , that Domestic International Sales Corporations will solve our balance of payments problem , that capital gains are the " lifeblood " of U.S. investment , and so on . Mr. Connally used to offer a hymn of praise for every loophole or subsidy in the Internal Revenue Code . Now President Nixon has begun to extol certain subsidies without any evidence that they work . At a Connally barbecue a short time ago the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly favor not only the present depreciation rate , but going even further than that , so we can get our plants and equipment more effective . That is why , in terms of depletion , rather than moving in the direction of reducing the depletion allowance , let us look at the fact that all the evidence now shows that we are going to have a major energy crisis . To avoid that , we have to provide incentives rather than disincentives for people to go out and explore for oil . That is why you have depletion and the people have got to understand it . But the President is asking the pedple to believe a myth  --  there is no evidence that the special tax breaks for petroleum have brought about any significant increase in net production . On the contrary , Dr. S. Edward Erickson and Stephen Millsaps conclude in a recent Congressional study that " the consensus of professional economic opinion is relatively certain that the special tax provisions for petroleum result in an inefficient allocation of resources , a smaller national income and questionable income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this tax subsidy with figures that show , anannual Treasury cost of $1.4 billion generating only $150 million in additional petroleuM reserves . And this kind of poor performance is the general rule for tax subsidies . In a recent Joint Economic Committee volume entitled The Economics of Federal Subsidy Programs , evaluations of seven tax subsidies worth a total of $23 billion a year found that the subsidies did n't work at all , did n't work efficiently , or had adverse effects on the economy . An analysis of long-term capital gains , for example , led the authors to conclude that a persuasive case for the favorable treatment of capital gains has yet to be made . With respect to the investment credit , which Mr. Nixon called the " strongest short-term incentive in our history to invest in machinery and equipment that will create jobs , " the study concluded that it was an ineffective short-term stimulant to employment . And even more damning was a study showing that the tax treatment of U.S. firms operating abroad probably reduced U.S. productivity , held down ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In releasing the volume , Sen. William Proxmire , chairman of the committee , noted the lack of hard evidence that tax subsidies achieve important social goals : " The disturbing thing about these tax subsidies is the way they tumble into being without any careful study . The Treasury Department , the Congress , and the public all seem to think we can solve our problems by giving someone a tax break . Too often we do n't solve any problems , we just create new ones . " Myth Number 5 : The Nixon Administration Wo n't Raise Taxes . The latest myth being created by the Administration  --  and the most absurd  --  is that the nation wo n't see a tax increase under four more years of Nixon . Once again , the President 's lieutenants are working harder to obscure the reality of the nation 's fiscal problems than to find solutions . The Nixon budget is on its way to being out of control , running an actual deficit this year of about $35 billion ? $10 billion more than the Administration 's own estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget , published by the American Enterprise Institute , the future picture for the Nixon budget is equally grim because existing government commitments alone will require tax increases of some $21 billion in 1975 . Most economists agree that to allow these huge deficits to occur as the economy approaches full employment is to invite a rapid acceleration of inflation . For example , Murray L. Weidenbaum , a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Nixon , had this to say about the situation : " To put it simply but accurately , the federal budget is heading the wrong way . . . . I am worried now , , . . We have a growing deficit , in the neighborhood of $35 billion . Whether you are a practitioner of the new economics , the old economics , or whatever , that just does not make sense . " Because the budget is headed in the wrong direction , good economic policy dictates that taxes be raised , expenditures cut , or both . But the Administration apparently has decided not to speak to these issues directly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential aide John D. Ehrlichman went before the White House press corps on the afternoon of September Ehrlichman : No . Question : You talk about reallocation or cutting spending . - Ehrlichman : I would n't rule out reforms in the tax system which might achieve both an increase in equity to the taxpayer , a simplification to the taxpayer , and the creation of a pool of money which could be devoted to this Question : And would it not tax increases ? Ehrlichman : That is not what I said , no . Question : But that is the question . Ehrlichman : Beyond that , I am getting into reading you the President 's option paper , and that I will not do . As one can see , Mr. Ehrlichman 's simple ban on taxes is so filled with qualifications , contradictions and escape clauses that its only purpose can be to obscure . According to Ehrlichman , there will be no tax increase under Nixon except for the possibility of a value-added tax , the substitution of a new tax for an old tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including tax reform if necessary , or when Congress exceeds certain of the President 's budget requests , and other unforeseen contingencies . A Washington Post editorial found just the right words to describe Ehrlichman 's press conference performance : " Those who follow tax policy seriously will , by this time , have held his various statements up to the light and located the escape clauses written in lemon juice between the lines . " Although President Nixon appears truly committed to cutting the spending side of the budget ledger , Ehrlichman and other Administration spokesmen are equally vague about where and how they propose to make such cuts . While there are several reasons why the Administration would choose to obscure that side of the budget  --  to avoid , losing the votes of those affected , and to avoid admitting that the Congress has cut more than the President in such areas as defense  --  the overriding reason is that the Administration ca n't come up with the $12 billion in spending cuts needed to give the fiscal 1973 budget a full-employment balance . A confidential study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the year , for example , was able to put its finger on only about $4 billion in " questionable " programs . The problem that the council staff - ran into , and which faces all zealous budget cutters , is that more than 70 per cent of the budget for a single fiscal year is relatively uncontrollable , in the sense that it is allocated to prior commitments , automatic payout formulas mandated by law , and so on . Even cutting controllable spending is difficult for the Administration because the bulk of it lies in defense , an area the President apparently feels is sacrosanct , and a good deal of the rest consists of high-priority programs for pollution abatement , school aid , urban improvement and state and local grants . There are of course low-priority programs that can and should be cut  --  such as farm price supports , impacted school aid , merchant marine subsidies , public works projects , and general aviation subsidies  --  but it is doubtful that either the President or Congress will have the political will to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough to correct the present budget difficulties . Thus , even with the spending problem now in the hands of super budget cutter Caspar Weinberger , one can not seriously consider economies by themselves an adequate solution to the current dilemma . So what do these vignettes on Nixon 's tax and spending policies mean ? In the first instance they mean that Nixon 's tax policy is to a great extent based on mythology . The omitted loophole income of the rich , the failure to calculate benefits on a per taxpayer basis , the phony statistics that corporations have not received significant tax benefits since 1969 , the unsupported proposition that tax subsidies achieve important social goals , and the promise that there will be no tax increase under four more years of Nixon , go far to project a distorted picture of our tax system . The statements that we can solve the government 's financial problem by simply cutting excessive Congressional spending also do not square with the facts . In short , the President has not presented an honest picture of the budget or realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second instance , the Administrat'ion 's tax and spending pronouncements reveal an ingenious set of political maneuvers designed to shift the blame for large deficits and unfair tax burdens onto the Democrats . The unsettling facts facing Mr. Nixon are four years of Republican deficits amounting to more than $95 billion and George McGovern 's thoughtful tax reform proposal . More and more people are asking why the President 's management of the economy has led to such huge deficits and why he has no plan for tax reform . Rather thandeal with these issues , Mr. Nixon has decided a good offense is the best defense in an election year . And apparently his view of a good offense in this situation is to obscure the tax and expenditure realities of the budget , to equate tax reform implicitly with a tax increase , and to say it is Congressional spending that has caused the deficits . That is the logic behind the President 's emphasis on a spending ceiling , and his recent radio statement that there is a " clear and present danger that excessive spending by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " While it is an open question whether the strategy will succeed politically , one might ask what it does to the President 's pledge that " Government must say what it means and-mean what it says . " But beyond the ambiguity and politics , important as they may - be , there are important considerations of how the Nixon policy will affect the performance of the economy and the extent to which each citizen shares in the economic pie . First , the absence of a commitment to tax reform mocks the promise of economic justice in the American economy because it will eventually mean a more regressive tax increase for the average citizen . Second , as was the case with President Johnson in 1966 , Nixon 's distortion of the need for tax reform and additional revenues will surely lead to serious economic chaos : the . huge deficits will continue , a tighter monetary policy will raise interest rates , costs and prices will again accelerate , and we wo n't see the end of wage-price controls . In this way , Mr. Nixon 's tax mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes so highly than could the malice of its most ardent enemies . ?
