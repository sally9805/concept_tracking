Upset by charges that he lacked legislative clout , Hudson did some fast thinking . <P> He announced he would not eat until all of his bills were considered . The tall ( 5 ft. 11 in. , 185 Ibs. ) legislator lost 34 Ibs. during his first 33 days of fasting , but he won a partial victory ; last week legislative committees agreed to assess 22 of his proposals . Said State Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Uher : " I 'm setting these bills as fast as I can because I do n't want to see Sam dying on us . " During a committee meeting , Uher offered Hudson a glazed doughnut , but Hudson-who has consumed only orange juice and water since his strike began-refused . Still , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A few more days like this and I can go back to eating . " The meal of his dreams ? Well , mustard greens and dumplings.
