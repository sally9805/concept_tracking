In the continuing effort to try to shoehorn a few more people and ideas into Jimmy Carter 's days , Scheduler Tim Kraft 's shop photocopied the President 's schedules and laid them out for study . The visual impact was stunning-ranks of names , events , ceremonies . No wonder , they muttered , the planned 55-hour week for Carter had grown to 71 hours and , if the truth about his private time were known , probably 80 or more . <P> Carter had complained early on about the amount of paper he had to consume . His staff analyzed operations through his first six weeks and tried to improve things . But the study of the second six weeks showed only a small drop in the work load . Unscheduled consultations and pop-in appointments were taking up as much as 15% of the precious presidential day . Carter , it appeared , was the one who was being forced to adjust . He added four more regular weekly meetings to his schedule . He ordered his wake-up calls at 6 a.m. ( instead of 6:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found some schedules from previous Administrations and marveled at the relative isolation Carter 's predecessors enjoyed . <P> So last week when the New York Times strongly suggested in a front-page story by James Wooten that the President was closing his mind and not listening to dissent , there was a minor explosion from Press Secretary Jody Powell . For 20 minutes he lectured the world about the inaccuracies of the account . It sounded like somebody playing old White House tapes . John Kennedy blew up at the New York Herald Tribune , and canceled all 22 White House subscriptions to the newspaper They used to keep the bad clips from Ike to avoid eruptions of his barracks temper . L.B.J. thought the press was a giant conspiracy to portray him as " your corn-pone President . " During Watergate , Ron Ziegler 's press briefings often had a portion devoted to the sins of the Washington Post . <P> The fact is that the presidency has so many facets that its millions of viewers - and the world 's press-can pick up just about any glint they want . Collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accurate in detail but in the whole mosaic gravely exaggerate a President 's traits while failing to consider inevitable forces of the office that require his resistance . Hardly had Powell 's ire cooled than other columnists were citing certain parallels between Carter and Richard Nixon . Curiously , the Times profile of Carter as a man jealously clinging to his power , occasionally alone , resisting contradiction and eschewing political maneuver , is not at odds with part of the image he has built up during his public life . Carter has always been more technocrat than pol , a man who stayed out of back rooms , who said no to special interests , who reached a point when he did not want to argue longer . During the campaign these traits were billed as desirable contrasts to the old-boy Washington clubhouse atmosphere . But back then he never had to act .
