Three years ago , when West Germany 's air force was losing almost two Starfighter jets a month in crashes , Kai-Uwe von Hassel , who was then the Federal Republic 's Defense Minister , offered a very personal defense of the ill-fated aircraft . To critics of the U.S.-designed , German-built fighter-bomber . Von Hassel replied that he had such faith in the plane that he had no hesitation about allowing his only son to become a Starfighter pilot . Last week , after a routine 75-minute flight over the North Sea , a Starfighter piloted by Lieut . Joachim von Hassel , 29 , crashed into a forest and exploded in flames . Von Hassel became the 55th pilot to lose his life in the 117th Starfighter crash since 1961.
