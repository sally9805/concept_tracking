Two stories by John L'Heureux I ROMAN ORDINARY H Is HOLINESS POPE PAUL VI is an ordinary saint . All day long he does what he has to do , and at night he dances . First thing in the morning , after meditation and mass , he has a little orange juice and a sweet roll with butter . Some days coffee . Some not . It depend-6 on what Romagnoli brings . And then His Holiness goes to the toilet , but not very much . Afterward , he makes his bed . Then it 's business , business , business without a letup . Cardinals are in and out all day : Vatican finances , the pill , a paternity suit against some bishop . Cardinals Ragnin and Konig present in outline their report on Opus Dei , a suspect lay order in Spain ; it turns out that Opus Dei is allied with the right wing of the Curia , and it turns out , too , that its in fluence in Spain , and even in Italy , is beni Not only tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made on the sec archives of the Vatican Library . And w about that Benedictine nun who said mass Chicago ? Is His Holiness thinking of  --  I can we put it  --  retirement ? Perhaps when is eighty ? No ? Pilgrims are lined up waiting for the papal blessing , a sea of lievers awash in their saris and douhlek and platform shoes . So much ugliness hope . Did Christ have all of this in mi The thought flickers for a second through papal consciousness , but His Holiness e3 guishes it with the single bat of an eyel He smiles distantly . He speaks a few w of welcome in German , in French , in GI in English . A cardinal whispers to him then he welcomes the Indians and the Slays . People dear to our heart . All one in the love of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Some damn fool snaps a picture even though cameras are forbidden . After a while they all let His Holiness go , and he trails his long white robes behind him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papal apartment consists of a sitting room , a bedroom , and a bath . The sitting room has four little chairs , designed to be uncomfortable , and a big desk where His Holiness sits during private audiences ; lots of faded tapestries cover the walls . The bedroom is huge , with a glistening parquet floor and almost no furniture . A wooden bed of no special design stands over near the windows ; at its head there is a small armoire which holds the pope 's robes , and next to that a bureau for his socks and underwear and hankies . On the opposite wall stands the great armoire to which Pope Paul VI alone has the key . His Holiness lies down on the narrow bed , but the ' quiet does n't last long . That little priest Romagnoli is banging around in the sitting room , laying out the tea . Cold tongue ) f Iamb , three caramels , a piping cup of : onstant Comment .

This is his private time , with the shoes sicked off and the old feet up , just enjoying is caramels and tea . Life is good . When he ras younger , he used to meditate on the tranitoriness of all things mortal during this tea-me , but now that he is in his late seventies , e makes his mind a blank . Nothing . Nothing ; happening . His fifteen minutes are up now and the lit-e priesty-poo is chapping at the door , ostenbly to take away the tray , but really to edge is Holiness into the next round of duties . Delegations are waiting from Russia , from , : : rsepolis , from Houston . The mistress of a math American dictator demands , for the rentieth time , a private interview . Cardinal right is waiting to talk about Joan of Arc d about election procedures for choosing e next pope . A monsignor from L'Osserva re Romano is owed a private word because his ringing defense of the personal lives two curial members  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private word , His Holiss could pose for a quick photograph ? Initments in obsolescent housing must be liqlated , now , while prices are still adequate . bishop is waiting , a cardinal has a special . ort , three monsignori have brought money dollars . Can Henry Ford remarry ? Can President Ford ? His Holiness attends to all these matters , his frail yellow hands pressed hard against the white breviary he carries everywhere , his mind only occasionally wandering to the night and to the great armoire in his bedroom . Finally the work is done and he is free . He goes to his private chapel and prays , sometimes for only twenty minutes , sometimes for an hour . He goes out of himself during this time , looking back wistfully at his own kneeling figure , or looking down from the Stations of the Cross high on the gilded wall , or  --  more and more Lately  --  looking off to nothing , nothing at all . Dinner is laid in the papal sitting room : a large bowl of granola , an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single glass of wine . It is ten o'clock by now and Rome is beginning to come alive . His Holiness toasts the city and its twenty layers of civilization , roof built upon ruined roof , bone upon bone . Everything is in the process of decay . While the number of Catholics has continued to increase , the number of priests has dropped : last year from 344,342 to 339,635 . The Vatican deficit is about $6.4 million , The Americans do n't give a damn . What to do ? His Holiness shakes his head slowly , wisely , from side to side . Again he raises his glass to Rome , to the Via Veneto with its Ferraris and movie stars and Anita Ekberg , and beneath it all to the catacombs with their still unexplored chambers of whitened hones . A FTER DINNER it is canasta time , or blackjack , or honeymoon bridge , whichever Romagnoli prefers . Monsignori , bishops , cardinals , indeed all ecclesiastical Rome dreams of some day playing canasta with His Holiness , but those dreams will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young priest who brings his meals and tidies up around the place . A Sicilian , hot-tempered . Romagnoli plays to win and usually does . At eleven that Dominican , private confessor to the pope , appears at the door ; at eleven-thirty , his soul washed clean , His Holiness takes to his bath so that by twelve he will be fully prepared . His Holiness Pope Paul VI stands before his bathroom mirror examining his face . Some insane historical accident is responsible for what he sees , because from that mirror there stare back at him the hate-filled eyes of Adolf Eichmann . The nose is the same , the chin , the brows . He smiles to alter the expression , but the eyes remain hard and unseeing as blue stone . They could be brothers , he and Eichmann , they could be twins . He shakes his head , he must not think of it , God 's little joke on him . It is a few minutes to twelve now and almost time . His Holiness puts on his pajamas of some rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are tied at the ankles with thin brown ribbons . The top slips over his head and is gathered at the waist by a brown sash . The sleeves are wide and loose . His white slippers turn up at the toe like a medieval jester 's . He is almost ready . He goes quickly to the small bureau near the head of the bed and , reaching far hack into the top drawer , he withdraws a large square of white cloth embroidered with brown . In the center of the cloth there is a circle of leather which will protect his skull from the knife blade . He folds the cloth carefully and then places it on his head , the circle of leather directly on the crown . He tucks the folds of cloth back from his face , arranging it like an Arab burnoose , and then binds the headdress firmly into position with a brown silk circlet . In the mirror he adjusts the silk cord across his forehead and smoothes out any wrinkles in the cloth . Is this some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The embroidery along the edge of the white cloth could tell us something , surely , but we can not examine it closely enough because there is no time . The bells of Rome have begun to proclaim midnight . While they toll on and on , His Holiness walks to the great armoire and turns the little key smoothly in the lock . The carved double doors swing open . his Holiness genuflects and then stands with his palms together in the attitude of prayer . But he is not praying . He is marveling yet again at his wonderful bones . The armoire before which he stands contains a tier of thirteen shelves , each of which , at the mere touch of the papal finger , slides out to provide ready access to its treasures . Pope Paul VI presses one of the lower shelves where his large bones lie on a ground of purple silk ; gently , soundlessly , it moves toward him until it touches his folded hands , and then it stops . Spread out there before him in perfect order are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them lie clavicle , humerus , radius , ulna ; in the shelf above , the metacarpal and the phalanges . Light from the ceiling casts a violet shadow on the bones and they glow almost with a life , with a soul , of their own . He presses gently on the shelf above this one and out slides a display of his corpus , his tarsi , his patellae . And then the special shelf , the one with his skull intact , the bones very nearly articulate . His Holiness runs his fingers lightly over the forehead , and his pale hand tingles . The eye sockets are smooth round holes , yellowing at the edges ; he pokes his thumb into that strange Eichmann aperture , no eye there , no vile jelly left . The pope catches his breath . This is how it will be , later . when at last he lies dead : his bones will wail in some dark vault for something , for any thing . And yet they lie here now , put away out of sight , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of an ordinary saint . Hie breath comes quicker , lighter . He presses the shelf above , and the shelf above that , and ther rapidly , one after another , all the shelves bu the top one , each with its cargo of white am glistening bones . His bones . The double doors stand open , the shelve of the armoire expose their treasure to th empty room and to the pope , who has begu to back away . Facing the huge armoire , h bows deeply and then , thumb and middl finger pressed together , he raises his arms or from his sides until he stands cruciform . Is a flamenco dance ? He extends one leg to a side and brings it forward suddenly in a kin of crouch , spins on his forward foot in sweeping circle , and then repeats the motic with his other leg . No , it is not flamenco . F is dancing slowly , ritually , like a harem dance like some small Persian boy trained to do th and this alone . His headdress flutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t fluid motions of his arms . He is losing hi self , his eyes have taken on a distant look , if he sees beyond this room and these bon he honors with his dancing . Now the pope approaches the armoire in formal hesitation step . He bows low for SI eral measures and then he presses the topmr shelf which slides toward him bearing the lo curved sword with which he must clan Tenderly he lifts the sword in his two bar and holds it up , like a presentation , befr the armoire . And then he moves to the otl side of the room and makes his presentati and then to the next and the next . In center of the room he stops . His head is bow He summons his considerable powers of c centration and then , decisively , he places sword squarely on the crown of his head , curved blade poised on the circular lent patch , the tip hanging to the left side of head , the handle to the right . He adjusts sword for balance , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and the rests motionless . His Holiness takes a to tive step or two . Perfect . The blade whin against the leather but remains in balanc ' His Holiness is smiling as his body moves about the room . The small feet glide sound ' iessly on the parquet floor . The muscles in ' his back and belly ripple like water . As his frail torso lurches forward and back , his buttocks respond and his thighs follow through . He dances slowly and with grace . In their exposed shelves , his bones are radiant . He dances on and on , though the bells of Rome have struck one o'clock and then two . It seems he must stop now , surely he must , he has danced so long . But he continues . And now he kneels , the blade on his head dipping from right to left . Slowly , so slowly you can feel the blood pulsing in his thigh and temple , slowly he sits back upon his heels . He slides somehow to his hip and then his iutiock until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full length , but with his head erect ind the sword in calm and easy balance across its crown . Ecstatically , all the muscles of his iody ripple , for he has completed this imposible thing . On their shelves his bones clatter. t is done . With a sudden twist of his entire body , His loliness is on his feet once more , free now of le most exacting part of his dance ; the rest sheer jubilation . He dances gladly , arms iviriging out and away from his body , legs vining and entwining as he moves in arcs nd arabesques undreamed of . On and on he les , though the minutes slip by , though the ocks strike again and again . His flesh rip-es and flows . The garments that surround s flesh seem to float free of it . There is nothg beneath those garments but water or air . o flesh is there , surely . Pope Paul VI 's bones have rested in the moire for how long now , attended nightly this ritual dance . And now the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes zed and all-seeing , his body and bones heed to pure spirit . Later , unfleshed , His Holiness will kneel at window to watch dawn break and later 11 he will crawl to bed for an exhausted hour steep before the rest of his world awakes d Romagnoli comes to announce time for ditation and mass . He will take up again make-believe life of interviews and reports I decisions , pretending . But now it is the ice that matters . he dance winds on faster and faster and sword too moves with an independent life . Holiness twists endlessly clockwise and sword , its curved silver blade glimmering : he light of the bones , twists cowiterclocke , faster and faster as His Holiness Pope 11 VI , that ordinary saint , dances out of flesh and bones , and dances and dances . gilt
