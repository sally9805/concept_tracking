While the U.S. and China are engaged in a sudden flurry of diplomatic initiatives , Europe is preoccupied with its own negotiations . Though the European talks lack the drama of Peking 's gestures , their outcome will have a profound effect on the future shape of the Continent . One of the negotiations tests whether Western Europe can gather the necessary resolve to make the decision for the expansion of the Common Market . The other centers on the basic question of whether or not the Soviet Union is genuinely prepared to help bring about an accommodation in Central Europe , which in turn could ease the Continent 's semipermanent division into hostile blocs . <P> Stalled Ostpolitik <P> When West German Chancellor Willy Brandt signed the Treaty of Moscow last August , he tied its ratification to a successful resolution of the problem of West Berlin , which depends on tenuous lifelines that stretch 110 miles through hostile East German territory . Last week , as the ambassadors of the Big Four completed their 18th meeting in Berlin , it was disappointingly clear that no solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets were so eager for West German trade and technology that they would be willing to guarantee the economic viability of the city and improve the lot of West Berliners by safeguarding the access routes between West Berlin and West Germany . Otherwise , Western firms will leave , and their exodus would cause an economic and psychological crisis in the isolated city . <P> Brandt 's reasoning was buttressed by the Soviets themselves , who gave private assurances that they were prepared to be reasonable . But last December 's consumer riots in Poland seem to have made them less flexible . East Germany 's Walter Ulbricht , who at 77 is the self-proclaimed dean of Soviet-style Communism , warned Moscow that accommodation with the West over Berlin without diplomatic recognition of East Germany would undermine his position , and that what happened in Poland could be repeated in East Germany . <P> Some Western diplomats still insist that a West Berlin accord will be reached - some day . But the fact is that the Soviets and the West are at present so far apart that no agreement can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other drastically alters its stand . After last week 's session ended , TIME 'S Bonn Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate managed to obtain a picture of the Western and Soviet positions . The major issues : <P> ACCESS . West Berlin is linked to its markets in West Germany by three autobahn routes , four rail lines and four waterways . The Allied powers insist that the Soviet Union must ensure the right of free passage between West Germany and West Berlin . The Western powers , for example , have proposed sealed trains that would roll untouched through East Germany . The Soviets refuse . They maintain that since the routes pass through the German Democratic Republic , it is up to the West Germans and West Berliners to negotiate with the East Germans . Such an agreement would mean that the West recognizes East German sovereignty over land access routes to West Berlin , which the West refuses to do without a Soviet guarantee of a free flow of traffic . Without such assurances , East Germany would have complete veto rights over the traffic .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
