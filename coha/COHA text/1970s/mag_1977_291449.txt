To see the California drought at its worst , TIME Correspondent James Wilde visited Orland ( pop . 3,241 ) , a farming community in the Sacramento Valley . His report : <P> Until now , Orland has been famed chiefly for its appearance in Ripley 's Believe It or Not as a tiny town with no fewer than 13 bars and 21 churches-all active . Today , Orland is better known as a victim of a savage drought that is entering its second year . Its orchards , dairies , small farms and citizens are all in trouble , and the bars and churches are better patronized than ever before . In fact , the churches have been holding rain prayer meetings from 10 in the morning until 10 at night-so far to no avail . <P> Normally , Orland 's three reservoirs contain 140,000 acre-feet of water ; now they are down to 5,000 acre-feet . Instead of the usual 18 crop irrigations per season , there will only be one this year . Farms have suffered more than $3 million in losses , and farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town 's businesses , which depend on agriculture , are down 40% in sales . Twenty-seven of 58 grade AAA dairymen have sold out and left the community . If the orchards do not get sufficient water by spring , the remaining trees will die . The whole economy is on the brink of collapse . <P> The true dimension of Orland 's plight becomes apparent in a walk through the fields with burly , gray-haired Robert McCombs . His quarter-mile-long slough for storage is empty . So is his well . His oats are stunted like a day 's growth of beard on the dry fields . He sold off calving cows earlier this year because he could not water them . Paul Pehrson 's 20 acres of orange trees are literally dying before his eyes . " It would take me ten to 15 years to get started again , " he says . " I ca n't face starting all over again . " The only immediate remedy for orchard growers was an offer from a company in Los Angeles to provide water at nearly $90 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't afford to pay that , " said Walnut Grower Charles Jasper . " It would come to $27,000 a year , I figure . " <P> The manager of the local branch of Lloyds Bank California , June L. Young , admits that farmers are far behind on their mortgage payments . " This is the second year we 've had to carry many of them . I 'm not going to foreclose on anyone this year , but we ca n't hang on indefinitely . " <P> Normal amenities are being curtailed by the drought . For three months , many farmers have trucked to town-which still has water in its deep well-to fill pails of water at the firehouse , use the toilets and take a bath . Townspeople have been inviting their country friends to share the water . Says Greg McCombs , editor of the local weekly newspaper : " I have no water , so I use a friend 's bathroom in town . " <P> What makes the situation all the more frustrating is that relief is tantalizingly close . Some 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Stony Creek alluvial fan that has 13 million acre-feet of water . The town is seeking a federal grant of $5 million to drill as many as 30 wells by May . But bureaucratic red tape has tied up the town 's application for federal assistance .
