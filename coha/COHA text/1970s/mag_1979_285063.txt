A holdout in Daniel Flood 's bribery case causes a mistrial <P> The evidence kept mounting against Pennsylvania 's Democratic Congressman Daniel Flood in his three-week trial for taking more than $60,000 in bribes . A lobbyist , three businessmen and a rabbi told of paying off Flood to arrange federal grants and contracts . Stephen Elko , Flood 's onetime top aide who is now serving a two-year sentence for taking bribes from some of the same people , quoted his old boss as saying , " This is a business . Get all you can while you can get it . " Meanwhile , the 16-term Congressman , known for his rococo oratory and baroque waxed mustache , declined to take the stand in Washington , D.C. 's federal district court or , in fact , to say anything . <P> Eleven jurors heard enough to convict . But not the twelfth . According to other jurors , retired Navy Cook William Cash , 63 , held out for Flood 's acquittal during the almost twelve hours of deliberation . The result : a mistrial-and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TIME has learned , federal agents received information linking Cash with individuals described as " associates of Flood . " Cash denies everything , but a strange tale has begun to unfold . <P> Soon after the jury retired to consider the verdict , Cash made it clear that he would vote " not guilty " on every one of eleven counts of bribery , conspiracy and perjury against Flood . At first , he would not say why . But then he told the jury that he had learned from " confidential sources " that three of the prosecution 's witnesses , including Elko , had " stolen " $176,000 from Flood . " Cash felt that the other three were guiltier than Flood and that Flood had been taken advantage of , " says Juror Elizabeth Vegos , 29 . Cash also stated that he did not want to convict Flood because of the Congressman 's age , 74 . The evidence against Flood was still overwhelming , other jurors argued . But , says Vegos , " it was just impossible to talk with the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 to 1 to convict Flood on at least four counts of bribery and three counts of perjury . Finally , Cash and the jury foreman , according to Vegos , disappeared into a bathroom to try to work out a deal : Would Cash go along with a guilty verdict on one count if the other jurors agreed to acquit on all the rest ? The jurors rejected that idea . <P> One wrote an unsigned note to Judge Oliver Gasch protesting : " I do n't think American justice should work this way . " When Gasch called the jurors together , he quickly learned of Cash 's so-called confidential information . Questioned by the judge , Cash simply shrugged and said it had been a " joke . " Back went the jury , with instructions to consider only evidence presented in court . Again it deadlocked , and the judge , " with the utmost reluctance , " declared a mistrial .
