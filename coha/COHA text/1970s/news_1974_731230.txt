txt Letters to the Editor Oil Industry : Questions  --  And an Answer To the Editor Besides the critique of oil companies in Tom Wicker 's Feb. 19 column , why does n't anybody ever ask these questions of the companies : qWhy are U.S. refineries being operated at only 82 5 per cent of capacity , the lowest in a decade , and below the annual average rate for any postwar year except 1961 ? ( Note . Stocks of crude oil are approximately equal to the year-earlier level , when operations were at 89.4 per cent of capacity . ) AlWhy is domestic production of crude oil held at 180,000 barrels per day below the Near-earlier level , despite the possibility of increasing production by as much as two million barrels per day in a shortage situation ? With gasoline production and imports 2 per cent below the year-earlier level and about equal to the 1972 level , and with stocks of gasoline only I per cent below the year-earlier level , why are many states getting 20 to 30 per cent less gasoline for general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports of crude oil to the West Coast , unaffected by the Arab embargo , been as severe as the reduction to the East Coast ' Does n't this all seem to add up to a deliberate curtailment of supply with the object  --  stated in unofficial predicMount Vernon Story To the Editor : Your editorial of Feb. 8 on President Washington 's beautiful Potomac home invites telling of an incident unknown , it seams , to many Americans . In April , 1741 , Lord Admiral Edward Vernon led an attack force of the British Navy against the impressive Spanish fortress of San Felipe in what is today Colombia 's Caribbean port of Cartagena . If Vemon 's 100 vessels and 27,000 sailors , soldiers and marines could take Cartagena and destroy this Capt .

In a Feb S editorial you condemned the independent truckers for refusing to accept President Nixon 's compromise with their negotiators I disagree with you . I believe the independent truckers are speaking up for all of us when they say they want a rollback of prices  --  all prices . Nothing else will be satisfactory . And if the Government does n't know how to do it , it had better do some brainstorming and find out .

Mr. Wicker asks how much of the record oil company profits are " really being ploughed into removing the causes of the oil shortage ? " Gulf Oil is in the process of spending an estimated $50 million to buy a circus and wanted to spend an estimated $700 million last October to buy an insurance company in a deal that felt through  --  both as moves said by the company to aim at diversifying into nonenergy fields Producing countries are rapidly nationalizing production and foreign trade in oil West Germany , Italy and India , among consuming nations , are moving in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing countries are " beyond the scope of a commercial enterprise , " and he calls for a " new structure created by governments .

This defect manifests itself as the inability to see any solution to an economic problem except a governmental solution After you indicated that there arc one million visitors to Mount Vernon annually , it apparently never dawned on you that the $4 million needed to buy up the remaining land could very easily be had by simply charging a visitor 's fee of $4 ( or less ) In a year or two the money would be raised , the land bought and the view mainta ; ned without anyone having his money expropriated by the Government for a purpose he may not agree with . Over 120 years ago the brilliant political economist Frederic Bastiat characterized the state as " the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else " How perceptive he was .

Asir Wsoca Bordentown , N 7 , Feb 9 , 1974 Watt-Saving Penalty To the Editor I think we have been had It was with the greatest interest that I read the article about how Con Ed has been granted a rate hike It seems to me that the more I was able to conserve rev electrical usage ( and it seems we all did ) the more I was really cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Con Ed because 1 was able to conserve electricity ' I should be able to think in terms of a smaller bill rather than another larger one I am waiting for the day the " middle-class New Yorker " has a fighting chance . MEL FEINSTEIN Brooklyn , Feb 12 , 1974 A ' No Confidence ' Vote To Fit Our Constitution To the Editor ' Because the impeachment process has never worked well and may not do so now , we need a means to call a President to account  --  for political or other reasons  --  between regular Presidential elections . One such device , whose creation would require a constitutional amendment , has long existed in parliamentary systems ' the formal vote of no confidence The United States could adapt this mechanism to its unique constitutional system as follows . By a 60 per cent vote of both Houses , Congress could pass a resolution of no confidence when , in its estimation , the President could no longer govern or secure the interests of the nation Such a vote would automatically trigger a special Presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties to meet in convention to select Presidential candidates The incumbent President could , of course , be nominated again , could run and might then he re-elected to serve out the four-year term . Should another be elected , he or she , too , would serve only the remainder of the term The procedure would not , as some might fear , create a parliamentary , rather than a Presidential , government . The Chief ENecutive would not be elected by Congress but , as he has always been , by the people . Congress itself would not be dissoh ed but would remain in session . What would happen is that the President would be given a chance to re-establish his claim to govern ; the Congress would regain some of its power to offset an irresponsible President , the major parties might regain some coherence and responsibility , and the people would have the chance to pass judgment on a crippled Administration before a long and critical span of four years had passed Britons and Europeans rightly marvel  --  and fear  --  the tendency of our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is time that the largest and most powerful democracy in the West find a new way to unburden itself and the world of Administrations which bring disrepute upon the nation or which are characterized , like the present one , by incompetence , malice and fraud JAMES M BANNER JR . Princeton , N J , Feb 14 , 1974 Defense Theme To the Editor : I recognize in Thomas Forte 's letter ( Feb. 20 ) a theme that is being stressed more and more in Mr. Nixon 's organized defense The idea is to make people think an impeachment is the same as a criminal trial . Mr. Forte says that Senators can not be impartial jurors because of " prejudicial publicity " Influence by letters from their constituents would be an even worse iolation of the jury 's seclusion I wonder what kind of impeachment Mr Forte would regard as proper . One in which the President 's malfeasance had gone unnoticed in the press ? Apparently the report from the House should come as a great surprise to the Senate , whose minds should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , where would the House have heard of it ' No , Mr Forte , I think your ideal is a nonimpeachment , in which the news really was suppressed . This is what we would have had if the White House hail succeeded in covering tip the crimes . HOPE HALE DAVIS Weston , Conn. , Feb. 20 , 1974 Of Bloodshed and Humor o the Editor A phrase often repeated in Ms. McCafferty 's Feb 4 Op-Ed article , " Poking Around in Cornflakes in Londonderry , " popped up in my mind when I was reading about the bus explosion killing eleven in Yorkshire in the next day 's New York ' Vries The phrase was have a titter of wit " Now Ms McCafferty should ask the families of the dead to share a titter of wit with her . I , for one , can only shudder in horror at the entire Irish tragedy and ask how anyone can find any clement of humor in it PAUL POLLACK San Jose , Calif , Feb. 13 , 1974 John Simon 's Frustrations To the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Op-Ed Feb. 151 , it occurred to me that sometimes " cultured " European refugees to the United States , even after long residence and almost perfect mastery of English spelling , remain incapable of leaming anything ahout the differences between an elitist social system and a democratic one . All the derogatory racial , sexual and class implications of the essay show the author 's snobbish longings for a lost " old order " in which his intellectual eminence would be recognized and his inferiors know their place ? I , dusting his books Rather than a serious discussion of the place of higher degrees in a mass society , Mr. Simon 's piece is an unconscious revelation of the frustrations and outrage of a certain type of self-centered intellectual confronting a world he does not understand and can not control . As a Ph D in comparative literature from the Unfversity of Chicago and a professor of theater at the City Universes of New York , I find this an interesting form of drama  --  not absurdest , hut realistic-psychological , still the preferred American genre .
