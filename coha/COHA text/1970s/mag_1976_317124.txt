In any election year , the conventional political wisdom often proves to be neither conventional nor wise . Herewith a random test : <P> &gt;Which presidential candidate is clumsiest ? No , it is not necessarily Gerald Ford . Ronald Reagan slipped off a snowbank in New Hampshire , but no photographer snapped his fall . Occasionally , Reagan has bumped his head with hardly anyone noticing ; more frequently ( and noticeably ) , he has also been known to put his foot in his mouth . <P> &gt;Who is the favorite candidate in the seven Southeastern states ( North Carolina , South Carolina , Florida , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi and Tennessee ) ? No , it is not George Wallace . It is Ronald Reagan . <P> &gt;Well , then , Wallace is second choice in this area , right ? Wrong . Gerald Ford is . A poll of 601 eligible voters , including Democrats , Republicans and Independents , conducted by Darden Research Corp. , showed Reagan was favored by 20% , Ford by 18% and Wallace by 12% .
