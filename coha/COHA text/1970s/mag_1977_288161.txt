High ratings-beratings from the real Watergators <P> The new slogan of television programmers might well be a version of Lord Acton 's aphorism : " Power corrupts , but oh ! so intriguingly . " ABC 'S $7.5 million miniseries , Washington : Behind Closed Doors , an unabashed takeoff on Watergate , was just about as successful as the network had hoped it would be . The show climbed steadily from an opening-night Nielsen 34 share , and at week 's end had captured a 40 or more share of tube watchers in major American cities . That was not quite a blockbusting success on the scale of Roots ( viewing share : 68 ) , but at ABC it was seen as a very smashing start for the fall season . <P> The 12-hour mlodrame clef has started a vigorous debate about the propriety of taking fictional liberties-including some extreme ones-with painful , important events of recent political history ( see Newswatch ) . Though they watched it with fascination , many viewers felt that Behind Closed Doors trivialized what it piously intended to portray : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington , there were flurries of telephone calls among Central Intelligence Agency alumni as they watched CIA Director William Martin ( Cliff Robertson ) explain to his mistress that he had lied before a Senate committee about political assassinations abroad . Martin is a fictional mutation of former CIA Chief Richard Helms , and a plot line of Behind Closed Doors is that the top spook blackmailed President Richard Monckton ( Jason Robards ) to cover up the killings . Nothing of the kind ever occurred , but some CIA veterans were concerned about the possibilities of further damage to the agency 's already battered image . <P> The truth of Behind Closed Doors is Robards ' extraordinary capturing of the persona of Richard Nixon . But aside from that , distortions abound . No evidence exists , for example , that John F. Kennedy ever personally ordered political assassinations abroad , as the show has it . The miniseries has the Washington Post discovering malfeasance long before the Watergate breakin ; it did not . The video version of the burglary by White House plumbers of the office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis courthouse ; instead of psychiatric records , the squad is after police records . The fictional Lyndon Johnson orders the CIA to carry out an illegal hunt for any Nixonian dirty laundry before the 1968 elections . So far as is known , Johnson did no such thing . <P> Investigative Reporter Bob Woodward says that the miniseries " illustrates the precise reason why Carl Bernstein and I refused to sell movie or TV rights to The Final Days . " Both feared what dramatization might do to their account of Richard Nixon 's resignation ; having been participants in All the President 's Men , they felt they could exercise some control over their first book . Woodward also objects to The Company , John Ehrlichman 's novel on which the miniseries is loosely based . Says Woodward : " The events , the characters are so thinly veiled . If a work is fiction , then there is an obligation to go a great distance away from well-known facts and characters . "                @ @ @ @ @
