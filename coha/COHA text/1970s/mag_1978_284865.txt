Ali defeats Spinks and regains his heavyweight title <P> It was not a great fight , this second meeting of Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks , but it was a remarkable fight nonetheless , a dramatic revelation of the changed hearts of two men played out over 15 rounds in New Orleans ' Superdome . Muhammad Ali 's fight was a statement of will and pride , redemption for the humiliation of losing his title to Spinks and reassertion of his uniqueness as an athlete . Leon Spinks ' fight was a cry of confusion , a constrained attempt to retain a title he had not known how to wear outside the ring . When it was over , Muhammad Ali had added another achievement to a long and extraordinary career : at 36 , nearly a quarter of a century since he started to fight as an amateur , Ali became the first man to capture the heavyweight championship three times . <P> From the opening seconds of the first round , it was clear that only the names were the same in the Ali-Spinks rematch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , when Spinks had pummeled Ali and stripped him of his crown . Then Ali was overweight and undertrained . Spinks had been a fury , lashing blows with desperate abandon . With an intensity that was touching , he fought to claim the right to an existence , not just a title . He wanted to be somebody . The outcome left both men with terrible challenges . <P> For Ali , there was the prospect of ending his career as a defeated fighter , no longer the champion he had dreamed of being since he was twelve . And there was the challenge of bringing his body back into condition to fight-really fight , not rope-a-dope-a powerful champion eleven years his junior . Leon Spinks , on the other hand , was overwhelmed by the new status he had so frantically sought . The privations of a ghetto background had suddenly been replaced by $3.75 million purses . The gap-toothed young street fighter was , overnight , the biggest man in sports . There were cars , women and arrests for driving without a license or headlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> While a deadly determined Ali holed up for intensive training , Spinks caroused and skipped workouts , counting on the strength of youth to carry him through . Ali relied instead on conditioning and the canniness of age , all the skills learned in 58 professional fights . He stepped into the New Orleans ring with a look of fierce concentration unseen since his third and final bout with Joe Frazier.
