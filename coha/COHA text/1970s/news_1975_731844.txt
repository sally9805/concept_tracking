txt The White House and Congress are already working on a compromise energy program , now that President Ford has agreed to delay his controversial tariff on imported oil . Rep. Al Ullman ( D ) of Oregon , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , has " spent some time " discussing possible next steps with White House officials , according to a congressional aide . Mr. Ford , for his part , calls the energy program put forward by Mr. Ullman 's committee " a basis for discussion , " but not " an acceptable compromise by itself . " The President vetoed legislation Tuesday which would have suspended his imposition of oil import tariffs , but softened his veto by agreeing to hold the tariff at the existing $1 a barrel for 60 days . Very likely , said a congressional source , Congress " probably wo n't even try " to override the President 's veto , now that Mr. Ford has shown a willingness to compromise . Nonetheless , House leaders tentatively scheduled a vote Thursday , March 6 , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top priority to a " simple but substantial tax cut to revive our economy and provide more jobs . " Earlier , the President had told 70 freshmen Democratic congressmen at breakfast that a tax cut was the first essential , with an energy program to follow . The President 's move affords time for the White House and key Senate and House lawmakers to work out an acceptable national energy plan , bepfoirrees.Mr . Ford 's 60-day deferral exFederal Energy Administrator Frank G. Zarb , meanwhile , has studied the Ullman . energy program and concludes that it differs from Mr. Ford 's plan in several respects , said White press secretary Ron Nessen . President Ford 's program , noted Mr. Nessen , would reduce oil imports by a million barrels of oil daily this year and another million next year . The Ullman plan , said the White House aide , would achieve " about half the President 's goal . " // * Ford and Congress at work on energy , yield on tariff // Mr. Ullman , while acknowledging the need to reduce oil imports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process in 1975 . Domestic U.S. oil production has been declining steadily since 1970 , so the economy , according to Mr. Ullman , needs its full quota of foreign oil this year . The Ullman plan , added Mr. Nessen , " does agree with the President on cutting back unnecessary use of cars , " by raising the price of gasoline . But Mr. Ford wants to save oil across the hoard , by taxing all its uses , through tariffs on foreign petroleum and equivalent levies on domestic crude . Damaging blow seen The White House , said Mr. Nessen , believes that the Ullman plan ? which would tax gasoline up to 40 cents a gallon ? would deal damaging blows at the " travel , leisure , and automobile industries . " Congressional critics charge that Mr. Ford 's taxes on oil would boost the consumer price index by at least two points this year . Mr. Nessen concedes this , claiming that the Ford program would add two points to Inflation this year and another half of 1 percent in 1976 . But , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation . White House analysts claim that each additional 10 cents a gallon tax on gasoline would h ke the consumer price index by 1 pe cent . Noting that Mr. Ullman 's program would decontrol the price of domestic oil and gas " over five years , " Mr. Nessen said the President believes decontrol should take place " Immediately .
