Travelers renting cars at most U.S. airports can choose to drive away the Fords of Hertz , the Plymouths of Avis or the Chevies of National Car Rental . Last week the Federal Trade Commission charged that the Big Three of the auto-rental business had combined to make sure that consumers got no other choice . Hertz , Avis and National , said the FTC , have been conspiring since 1968 to freeze competitors out of airport trade , which constitutes 70% of the $700 million-a-year business , and to keep car-rental prices artificially high . <P> The FTC alleged that Hertz , Avis and National conspired to submit identical bids for concession rights at airports , and persuaded airport managers to set requirements for concessions that disqualified competitors . One rule they are alleged to have promoted requires that " concessionaires have a nationwide reservations network . " The FTC also accused the three companies of fixing rental prices and stated that smaller competitors kept out of the airports charged 10% to 40% less . <P> Booted Out ? The commission further charged the rental companies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Avis with Chrysler and National with General Motors . According to the complaints , the arrangements provide the rental companies with advertising subsidies from the automakers that average $5 million a year to each , and " have the effect of increasing barriers to entry " to smaller companies , which do not get such large subsidies . <P> The three rental concerns denied the charges . The FTC chose not to accuse the automakers of any violation , but a spokesman for Ford denied that the advertising agreements were anticompetitive and said the company had similar agreements with some of Hertz 's smaller competitors . <P> A trial of the case before an FTC administrative-law judge may be a year off , and the companies could appeal any unfavorable ruling through the federal courts . If the FTC eventually prevails , the three companies could be forced to pay triple damages to any competitors or consumers who win lawsuits . The FTC might also seek to have one or more of the three big rental companies booted out of some airports and replaced by smaller competitors .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
