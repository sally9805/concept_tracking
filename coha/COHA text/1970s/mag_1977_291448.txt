At midday , Wheat Farmer Clyde Eveleigh stared out his front window near Ulysses , Kans . His yard light , which turns on automatically when the sky darkens , glowed dimly through clouds of gritty dust . " I 'm guessing that we got wiped out today , " he reported , " but I 'm not about to go out into the fields to find out-the air is so black I might get lost . " In eastern Colorado , too , gusts of wind up to 90 m.p.h. scooped up the drought-dry topsoil , hurling some five tons of the precious dirt off each acre of land during a 24-hour storm . Observed Rod Johnson , a federal agriculture official : " The eastern three-fourths of Kiowa County is moving . " <P> New Dangers . In a grimy arc , from Nebraska through the plains of Kansas and Colorado , on into the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas , scenes right out of The Grapes of Wrath suddenly materialized in the swirl of dust billowing up to 12,000 feet . The grit sifted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As visibility neared zero , motorists pulled to sides of roads , and highways were ordered closed . At week 's end the dust had blown over the southeastern states , turning the sky a milky yellow . To many worried Westerners , the worst dust storm in some 20 years brought back memories of the Dust Bowl , a disaster that could recur if there is no dramatic break in the lingering and worsening drought . <P> As people east of the Rockies choked , Californians were enjoying what was a welcome phenomenon for that parched state : rain fell for five days - the first substantial precipitation in eight weeks . At least temporarily , the culprit responsible for much of the nation 's wild and freezing weather-the stationary high-pressure system off the California coast-had broken up . Its departure allowed westerly winds to carry clouds over the Rockies and dump long-overdue snow on barren slopes in Oregon , Wyoming and Colorado . California 's refreshed farmers reveled in the rain , and mountain ski operators romped in the snow-but federal weather experts warned of ominous signs that the blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also clear that the accumulated moisture was but a drop in the bucket of water needed to prevent massive crop failures , hydroelectric power shortages , widespread economic losses , and mounting tensions over water allocations this summer and fall . <P> But the increasing prospect of a disastrous drought had ramifications far beyond the West . It raised once again basic questions of how the nation should use one of its most vital resources , just how much population growth the available water can sustain . As the U.S. faced what scientists termed the most serious drought conditions anywhere on the globe , a world perennially short of food might not be able to look to America to ease its hunger . Domestic food prices seemed certain to increase , job layoffs could follow as water-and hydroelectric-hungry industries are forced to reduce their operations . Added to the effects of the East 's frigid winter , the drought could pose new dangers of inflation and unemployment , threatening President Carter 's economic stimulus and budget-balancing goals .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
