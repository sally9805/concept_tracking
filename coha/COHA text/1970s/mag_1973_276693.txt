Max Ernst will be 82 this year . He is rightly held to be one of the fathers of modern art , having outlasted most of his progeny . Dada and Surrealism , the movements that he helped fertilize , are now ticketed and labeled . Their revolutionary ambitions have been reduced to connoisseurship and slipped into the museum . Most of Ernst 's allies in the Surrealist adventure are dead . <P> Yet Ernst continues , and he eludes the categories . Five years before Pollock , he dripped paint on a canvas from a swinging can . Long after Surrealism died as a movement , he preserved the fresh poetry of the Surrealist dialogue between images . He is the master of invoked accident and controlled chance , and he still paints as if the world could be directed-if not quite controlled-by a nudge of complicity . <P> Last month Rice University 's Institute for the Arts in Houston opened a remarkable tribute to the inexhaustible Max : the 104 Ernsts acquired in the past 30 years by Houston 's leading collectors , John and Dominique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable but underrated bronzes of the artist as sculptor-this is one of the most remarkable private collections of Ernst in the world . <P> Ernst was born in a small town outside Cologne . His father was a schoolteacher . From earliest childhood Ernst seems to have acquired haunting visual images . Some came during sickness . He remembers being ill and staring for hours at some mahogany plywood paneling , discerning there the shape of a dove , a nightingale , a girl-chimera-all familiar in his work . <P> Other visions were apparently acquired from emotional events and trying circumstances in his life . His father was stern and autocratic . When young Ernst was only 14 , his pet cockatoo died . The same day , almost to the hour , his favorite younger sister was born . Thereafter , Ernst 's subconscious apparently kept mixing the images of a bird as hope , maybe with sex and therefore regeneration ; of father as creator and destroyer ; and of the whole world as both a dreadful and exciting place . <P> During a later illness , Ernst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up discovering a new painting technique that he called " frottage . " He took paper and pencil , laid them over the textured surface , and scribbled away - as many a child has done over a penny on many a boring day . Allied to this was Ernst 's use of paint sponged and knifed on a canvas , with the images it suggested later sharpened with a brush . Figure-Mythological Woman was produced in just such a way . <P> Pedigree . Ernst went to the University of Bonn , studying philosophy , and psychiatry at a time , 1909 , when the subject was barely acknowledged as a discipline . After serving in the German artillery in World War I , he continued painting , and eventually reached Paris at a time when Dada was in full swing and Surrealism was about to be born . One purpose of Dada was to negate everything that art had stood for in the past . Yet Ernst 's love of images that rise from chance blots has a pedigree that goes back to Leonardo , who spoke of finding battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted garden of decaying vegetation , the birds and chimeras , the figures of Loplop and La Belle Jardinire-describe a territory of imagination that seems both mysterious and exactly mapped .
