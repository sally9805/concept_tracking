While testifying before the Ervin committee last summer , Jeb Stuart Magruder mentioned that the Committee for the Re-Election of the President had paid $20,000 to Author-Columnist Victor Lasky in 1972 . Amid the Watergate quakes , this disclosure hardly caused a tremor , but it did rattle Lauren Soth , editorial-page editor of the Des Moines Register and Tribune . He alerted the National Conference of Editorial Writers that the 100 papers subscribing to Lasky 's weekly column ( syndicated by the North American Newspaper Alliance ) had been uninformed about Lasky 's financial connection with C.R.P. <P> <P> The N.C.E.W. decided that Lasky had " abused his position as an editorial-page columnist " and that his syndicate was culpable for condoning the arrangement once it became known . The National News Council , - asked to look into the case by the editors ' group , upheld both charges on June 25 . But Lasky , 56 , a pugnacious conservative and veteran Kennedy baiter ( JFK : The Man and the Myth ) , is not taking the News Council verdict passively . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my column , " he fumes . " For that I should go on welfare . " Lasky explains that Republican friends were looking for a writer to do columns and speeches for Martha Mitchell at the beginning of 1972 . <P> " Finally someone said , ' Why do n't you take it ? ' " Lasky closed the deal , and the writer worked from March to July 1972 , ghosting gags , speeches and magazine articles for Martha . " I did lousy stand-up jokes for Mrs. Mitchell to tell on herself , " Lasky says now . " Next thing I know , a bunch of self-appointed busy bodies descends on me . " <P> Lasky insists that his labors for Martha had nothing to do with his column , which is merely a minor sideline for him . " Nobody gave me orders or told me what to write . " N.A.N.A . Executive Editor Sid Goldberg defends Lasky : " You know , in the nature of being a ghostwriter , you do n't advertise what you are doing . " Both men feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did when Lasky picked it up . <P> <P> * A 15-member panel established last year by the Twentieth Century Fund to monitor press fairness and accuracy .
