He had no " mica , " and he climbed into the car . " He just looked out of place ; like he was lost , " Barber said of Santos . " It 's just a feeling ; that 's how we know .

A ceiling placed on Western Hemisphere admissions that same year further increased the illegal entries . The waiting period for legal admission is now a minimum of 14 months , and a serious three-year drought in Mexico is drying up employment as well as the land , bringing new waves of illegals . But with only 58 agents to cover the Chicago area , Pillied said , there is plenty of work for his crew .

Santos led the way , thru a basement underpass to the back of the building and up a flight of stairs . Shared with Others He shared the apartment with two others . Together they paid $30 a month for the two-room flat . Sheetless beds , a bureau and a single calendar to decorate the walls told the story . This was just a resting place , a temporary headquarters for the making of money . Both the illegal alien and the money usually end up back in Mexico .

Few Become Citizens And the people do n't seem to grow roots either . There were about 98,000 legal aliens from Mexico in the city last year . But only 291 became citizens during that time . Barber said most illegals do n't last a year before getting caught . Pilliod pinned it d o w n-94 per cent are caught within the first year ; two-thirds within the first month . Barber chatted easily with Santos about home . There was no fear , no shame . The fear was over because the hiding was over , Santos said . And a man can not be ashamed for trying to bettor his standard of living , said Barber . Job , Way of Life The Anglo agent and the Latin illegal joked about the circumstances of the morning ; for one it is " just a job " ; for the other , " a way of life .

Most , he said , are weeded out at the border with 73 per cent getting caught as they enter the country .

Outside the hearing room , Robert Germain , investigations director for the Chicago Immigration office , shook his head . " That 's one of the major problems , " he said . " The illegals are so vulnerable . An illegal ca n't complain about making less than the minimum wage . He is afraid his boss will turn him in . And ho ca n't complain about other abuses either ? like shakedowns , poor living conditions , or ill health . " Legal Aliens Complain But some who do complain are the legal aliens . Many say they feel the problem of the illegals most because the illegals take their jobs and are willing to work for less . Germain said the majority of the tips his office gets regarding the location of illegals come from legal aliens . Ile said the office has more than 6,000 complaints on file from Spanish-speaking Chicagoans and that two Spanishspeaking girls answer phones to take such information . Pilliod says that the illegals cause further problems for legal aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal is hiding an illegal he is just as vulnerable . Canto for the Money Santos is n't complaining , even tho the " promised city " did not give him his dream of a " castle " back in Mexico . He came for the money ; that 's all . And in the four months he worked he was able to send 9,000 pesos$320 ? back to his mother in Southern Mexico . That is more , he says , than he could have saved in two years at home . So Santos concludes that it was all worth it . His dream was to stay illegally for one year . That , he stressed , would have bought him his plot of land , a few cows , and the long-range easy life . But what of it , he laughed , the 4,000 will buy him a few good years and then . . . " who knows ? . . . Maybe I 'll come back .

And his journey home began when he boarded the bus waiting in the basement of the Federal Building . About 40 other illegals joined him . He made it home just in time for his 26th birthday .
