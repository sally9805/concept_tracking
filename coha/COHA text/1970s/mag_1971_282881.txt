A FEW weeks before John Connally was sworn in as Secretary of the Treasury last February , he threw a big wingding at his ranch in Floresville , Texas . Under a striped tent the guests dined on succulent barbecued ribs and homemade ice cream . Their host , glowing and happy , exclaimed : " You know , this is a damn good life . " <P> For Connally , life has indeed been sweet . Beginning with his hardscrabble boyhood on a Texas farm , he has been irresistibly drawn to wealth and power and has managed , by an adroit mixture of dash and obsequence , to gain both . As Lyndon B. Johnson 's Wolsey for more than 30 years and a three-term Democratic Governor of Texas , he learned well the means of acquiring and using political power . Now he is one of the most potent and magnetic personalities in Richard Nixon 's Washington , the chief designer of Phase I , the prime enforcer of Phase II , and by most accounts the strongest Treasury Secretary since George Humphrey of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unencumbered by any noticeable traces of self-doubt or abiding commitment , Connally functions well on the shifting surface of events and has learned to do business with just about anybody . As he said about himself last week : " I 'm so little understood . There 's so little in my past to indicate what I think or believe . If people knew me well , they 'd realize that on many of the things they discuss about me so avidly , I have n't any views . " <P> Summer Lightning . A tall , handsome , immaculately tailored man with a carefully clipped e of silver hair , Connally cuts a striking , almost theatrical figure . No member of Nixon 's inner circle has his personal magnetism . He strongly resembles his longtime mentor , Johnson . There are the same drawling intonation of speech , the same earthy turns of phrase . Yet his features are finer and his manner smoother than Johnson 's ; nobody can quite picture Connally showing off an operation scar . He can charm foes with a wry , knowing smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Behind the smiles and easy badinage , however , Connally projects an icy , faintly bullying power that compels attention . His demands can be overwhelming . In a widely remembered remark about U.S. international trade and monetary goals . Connally summed up his position : " All I want is a fair advantage . " He is a bad loser . Says one Texas politician who has been up against him : " He is totally unforgiving of his political enemies . He 'll carry his grudges to the grave . He can also be tenacious as hell , clawing and pushing his way past any obstacle . " Connally is no less ambitious than Johnson and he has the same sure instinct for what people want and what they will give to get it .
