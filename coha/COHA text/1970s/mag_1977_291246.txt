OIL Round 1 to the Saudis <P> In the bitter scrap that pits Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the eleven other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , it is far too early to predict the ultimate winners . But so far , the minority of two seems to be ahead . The Saudis appear to be attracting enough new customers to force their rivals into production cutbacks and price fiddling . <P> The schism started a month ago at an OPEC price-setting conference in Qatar , when Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani and his allies in the Emirates refused to go along with the majority 's demand for a 10% hike on Jan. 1 , to be followed by a further 5% hike at midyear . The Saudis and the U.A.E. limited their increase to 5% for the full year . Thus , for the first time since OPEC began quintupling petroleum prices in late 1973 , the oil cartel split into opposing camps . In order to hold down prices , the Saudis , who are OPEC 'S largest producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's largest proven reserves ( 151.8 billion bbl. ) , threatened to increase production in order to lure customers away from their higher-priced rivals . So far , there are these signs that the Saudi strategy is working : <P> &gt; Iran , OPEC 'S second largest producer ( 5.7 million bbl. per day ) , conceded last week that it already has lost nearly half ite orders from independent oil companies , which unlike some of the big multinational concerns are not bound by long-term contracts . As a result , Iran expects total sales in 1977 to decline about 10% below original predictions , and will cut production accordingly . Venting their wrath , the Iranians warned that companies reducing purchases would be placed on an OPEC blacklist and presumably denied deliveries in the event of future scarcities . <P> &gt; Kuwait , the fourth largest OPEC producer ( 2 million bbl. per day ) , conceded that its production is running below normal . Many of Kuwait 's customers obviously were shifting their orders to Saudi Arabia , which produces the same heavy-grade heating oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; Indonesia has in effect failed to post the immediate 10% increase that it voted for in Qatar . Instead , the Indonesians have increased prices less than 6% on a grade of crude that accounts for more than half the country 's output . The motivation seemed to be a desire not to tempt Japan-the buyer of most of Indonesia 's oil-to turn to Saudi Arabia for oil . Said one official of the Mining Ministry : " What is the fun of fixing high prices if the Indonesian crude subsequently is not sold out ? " <P> The real test of oil prices will not come for two or three more months . Then the big international oil companies will have sold off the huge stockpiles of oil that they bought in anticipation of an OPEC increase , and will begin scrambling to buy more . Exxon has stated that it intends to market more low-priced Saudi oil in the West and will refine much of it in its huge complex on the island of Aruba , off the coast of Venezuela , which until now has processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and will increase output enough to satisfy demand can not be judged now . But Round 1 clearly has gone to Yamani &; Co.
