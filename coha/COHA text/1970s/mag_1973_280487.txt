Neither a borrower nor a lender be-the real bread is going to the savers . <P> Thus might a hip Polonius summarize the frenzied rise in U.S. interest rates . Last week the biggest U.S. corporations had to pay a record-and painful-8% to borrow from banks. * Some banks will raise that " prime " rate further to 9% this week ; it could go higher still , perhaps to 9% in the fall . The banks in turn had to pay as much as 10.3% to get money to lend ; that was the highest rate offered last week to depositors who would buy $100,000 certificates of deposit ( CDs ) . While borrowers and lenders alike groaned , savers rejoiced in the highest yields ever offered on even modest accumulations of money . <P> Early last month , Government agencies raised by a half-point the ceilings on interest for most types of small savings . On ordinary passbook accounts , banks are now permitted to pay 5% , and savings and loan associations 5% . From there , the bank ceilings rise to 5% on deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-to 2-year money ; and 6% on 2-to four-year deposits . On CDs running for four years or longer , banks can now pay anything they please ; the Federal Reserve Board requires only a minimum deposit of $1,000 and a penalty on the saver who withdraws his money before maturity . <P> In frantic competition for small deposits , banks and S and Ls are introducing higher-yielding varieties of $1,000 , four-year CDs almost daily and touting them in blaring bold-headlined newspaper ads and breathless radio commercials . Last week these CDs generally paid 7% annual interest , but many banks raised the effective return to 7.79% by compounding interest daily . Manhattan 's Union Dime Savings Bank advertised $1,000 CDs at 8% ; daily compounding raises the effective rate to a towering 8.72% . <P> Some banks are luring deposits by offering CDs with variable rates that could go higher still . First National City in New York , for example , came out with a plan under which $1,000 deposited for four years will earn interest each quarter at a rate of a half-point below what the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rate this quarter is 8.11% ; it can go either up or down from there , but never below the 5% passbook rate . Philadelphia 's First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Co. offers an " inflation-proof " $1,000 CD that will pay 7% to 10% interest , with the exact amount to be determined by how fast the consumer price index rises . <P> Being Stingy . The Federal Reserve touched off this wild scramble as part of its complex plan to calm the economy 's inflationary exuberance . For some time , the Fed has been trying to dampen borrowing by being stingy in doling out reserves to banks , and early in the summer , Board Chairman Arthur Burns abandoned his attempts to hold rates down by jawboning . The board then became worried that depositors would pull their funds out of banks and S and Ls in order to buy higher-yielding Treasury bills or commercial paper , leaving the savings institutions with no money to lend at any price . The interest rate on 13-week Treasury bills has more than doubled in one year , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks pay whatever they had to in order to attract funds .
