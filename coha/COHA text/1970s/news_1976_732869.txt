txt TO OBTAIN confessions always has been a thing a cop learned as he went along . The older guys gave advice now and then on the basics . " Grip the hose as if you 're shaking hands with it , " they would counsel a new man . But Just where to interrogate the suspect ? in his kidneys or his ribs ; or the proper angle for the blinding spotlight ; or how to guide an unconscious hand across the bottom of a page ; these were things that eply could come with time . Nowadays , of course , police departments frown on these methods and so do the courts . And the art of grilling people has been promoted to a science that one can go to school to learn . REID COLLEGE , 215 N. Dearborn St. , has begun offering what it calls " A Short Course in Criminal Interrogation . " Reid College is operated by John E. Reid and Associatesve firm best known Close-up With Jeff Lyon for the work it has done over the years with the polygraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the police and private industry . But the folks at Reid also do regular interrogation . And they do It without rubber hoses , or even threats . They do it scientifically . The idea is to get voluntary confessions that hold up in court in the face of tough Supreme Court rulings . Two years ago Reid and Associates Cons ffettinff a private course for their ' third degrees ' // decided to share its techniques with law enforcement people from all over the United States . Reid began conducting two-dal seminars In a " new structured approach to the art of criminal interrogallon . " This year , with demand high , , they expanded it to a five-day course . ? IT 'S BELT ) ONCE a month and costs $250 . More than 2,000 have taken it . Besides city , county , and state policemen ? and a few prosecuting attorneys ? that figure also includes postal inspectors , and agents from the FBI , Internal Revenue Service , Treasury Department , and Army Intelligence . Even the CIA enrolls at least one agent per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men need something to use when crushing fingers is impractical . I 'm a little sorry someone is teaching interrogation on the square . The old ' time methods were sort of quaint , especially those developed by Chicago police . The boys at the old Wabash Avenue Station used to put suspects on a " lie detector " they had rigged up to some flashing red lights and loud , bells . " Lefty , " they 'd ask the fellow to warm him up , " did you ever feel like stepping out on the wife ? " " Heck no , " he 'd answer , and the detective in the next room would activate the bells and lights . Lefty would quickly surmise that here was an infallible machine and begin spilling out his crimes . But man must progress . I WAS CURIOUS about what Reid teaches , so I asked Ivan Wemhoff , dean of Reid College and director of Reid and Associates in Chicago . I 'll give you some of the highlights . First of all , the modern approach does Close-up away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conducted by one person . The old " good guy , had guy " approach , where one cop leans on the suspect and the other cop treats him sympathetically , is passe . " People do n't like to tell other people they 've done something wrong . And it 's twice as hard to tell two people , " Wemhoff explained . The interrogator is la be patient , and speak in a sincere , straightforward manner . He Is not to badger loudly , or wheedle in a voice that might make the suspect wary of trickery . At all times he is to act polite and professional . THE INTERROGATION room must he devoid of distractions . The phone should be turned off , the walls nearly bare , the curtains closed . Suspect and interrogator face each other in chairs , with no desk between them . " A desk can be a fortress to the suspect , " Wemhoff said . " Also , the interrogator ca n't watch the suspect 's entire body for behavior symptoms . " What are behavior symptoms ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crook ? They would suddenly focus on the questioner 's forehead , or sometimes his right cheek . ? That 's a behavior symptom . Behavior symptoms are any kind of body or speech reaction repeated by a suspect every time  --  a sensitive question is asked . It can be a failure to make eye contact , a shifting in the chair , or uncrosa. ' ing of the leg . Or a subtle pause before answering . Properly read , behavior symptoms are reliable in giving away underlying guilt , Wernher ' says . And tile absence of such symptoms can also be used , with 75 per cent reliability , to eliminate the innocent as suspects . NOW YOU have the suspect before you . If you have a lord evidence yolf use the direct confrontation approach . " Lefty , " you say , " an investigation has taken place which shows you took $500 from the safe . " If he 's might shift in his chair , or say something to stall , like , " You mean me ? " If evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying " Lefty , our investigations shows yell were in the ? vicinity of the safe when $500. was tak-i , en . " ? , , , . ' Again you watch for behevitesphpf toms . A Violently hostile donlaViorten indicates innocence . Sitting and saying nothing , more often shows guilt . Sometimes the guilty person will deny It , and this should be cut off quickly ; otherwise it 's harder for the suspect to admit et-Mice later . Now COMES THE " theme " stage . You supply a rosy motive for the crime , You begin Spinning a tale in which the thief was trying hi pay medical bills or buy his kids Christmas presents . Or in which the murderer acted - in self-defense . You embellish tills theme , repeating it over and over . - Alen respond well when you imply others are to blame ; a stingy boss , perhaps , or a mean father from childhood . - Women like you to paint a picture of a ; devoted wife and mother helping- her . ' ; family by stealing . the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' glimmer of hope appears in 1 ' V which be figures he just might be able to admit this thing and still save face , " said Wemhoff . " Even the most hardened criminal does n't really want others to think he is a big ; had , dirty guy . " THE INTERROGAT ( 111 has another thing working far him , Wemhoff noted . Like the rest of us , criminals judge what 's normal by their own thoughts and actions . So they quite often believe everyone secretly steals or cheats , and they themselves wilt be more honest for admitting it . There 's a stage , in this " theme " development when the suspect is finally sitting quietly , attentively . Ile has ceased to deny . things . He begins shifting frequently in his chair , and you know he 's , weighing whether to confess . So you help him . You give him a choice , the simpler the better . " Lefty , " you blurt , " was it for Christmas presents or not ? " Ile will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made that critical first admission . THERE 'S A LOT STORE to this . You have to get him to repeat the admission again and again . You have to get his real motive . You have to extract infermedian only he could have  --  like where Ile stashed the loot  --  to prove he coopertiled in the confessien . You eves ask him irrelevant things ? like who his teacher was in 7th grade ? to prove the confession was voluntary . There arc procedures for all of it in the Reid course , and I wish I had space to tell you more . It 's fascinating . This stuff may even have some application for you . The next time cookies are missing from the kitchen jar , just sit your son down and say : " Billy , our investigation has placed you in the vicinity of the Oreos . " See what he does with his eyes .
