The New York City subway is cold , and spooky with shadows . Water drips from the vaulted ceiling into small pools beside the tracks below . At one end the platform a rusting steel bridge leads to the street elevator . It is past midnight . A well-dressed man walks nervously up and down , a few steps at a time , waiting for a train . He knows he is a target and is plainly scared . The elevator descends . The man sees six teen-age blacks sweeping toward him like a pack of wolves . First they literally sniff him up and down , then they urinate in a circle around him . They reek of the peppermint smell of angel dust , and they are looking for somebody to blow away , like this turkey . <P> Suddenly four more teen-agers in red berets emerge from the shadows at the other end of the dark platform . They are silent . But at the sight of them the wolves leave their victim , disappearing at a run down the track toward the next station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Curtis rescued man tries to say thanks , his words are drowned in the roar of an oncoming train . He gets aboard , shakily waving one hand at his young rescuers in a half salute . <P> The rescuers , one black , one Hispanic and two Chinese , are on patrol for a vigilante group that calls itself the Magnificent 13 . But for their presence at the 149th Street-Grand Concourse IRT station in The Bronx , the traveler might well have become one more grim ripple in the current wave of terror beneath New York 's streets . Nobody is sure exactly how many people have been robbed and beaten in recent months by teen-age gangs , often while fellow passengers and even train conductors did nothing . Already this year there have been eight subway murders . On one particularly bad night two token-booth operators in Queens were burned to death after some teen-agers poured gasoline through the change window and set it afire . <P> The situation got so bad that in March Mayor Edward Koch sent additional police underground to patrol subway trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 took up its underground patrols well before the mayor acted . The group 's founder and leader is Curtis ( " The Rock " ) Sliwa , 23 , a night manager of the McDonald 's restaurant at the corner of Broadway and 236th Street in The Bronx . Neatly turned out and ruggedly handsome , Sliwa became known as The Rock for his high school skill at brawling and an ability to go for days without sleep . He also has some notable experience with civil action . In 1977 he formed something called the Rock Brigade , 63 high school kids , all volunteers , who are still providing and servicing 440 garbage cans in the ghettos of the South Bronx to set an example of how to keep a neighborhood clean . Considering crime on the subways , Sliwa came to a conclusion . " Volunteer patrols , " he recalls , " seemed the only way to show those bums the public 's had enough . "                    @
