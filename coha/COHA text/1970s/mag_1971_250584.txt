IN their desperate search for cold cash , officials of financially strapped cities have lately been offering much apocalyptic prophecy about the impending bankruptcy of municipal governments ( see THE NATION ) . Cities have reached the limit of their taxing powers , they insist , and the Federal Government must rush to their rescue . Touring New York City last week to impress on the public the urgency of their plight , the mayors of eleven cities sounded even gloomier than usual . Said Boston 's Kevin White : " Look , we raise 70% of our money with the property tax , but half our property is untaxable and 20% of our people are on welfare . Could you run a business that way ? " <P> One of the major problems is that municipal governments depend on property taxes , mainly from real estate , for an average of 85% of the money that they raise locally . This year these governments will collect some $37 billion in property taxes , up from $22.6 billion in 1965 . But the property-tax system is a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfair to millions of individual taxpayers . Despite the legal requirement that property of equal value must be taxed alike , a Census Bureau study found that the typical homeowner can expect a tax bill that is 20% more-or less-than it ought to be . Some big , rich property owners pay little or nothing at all . <P> Erratic Assessments . In greatly differing ways , the cry for changes in the property tax has been picked up by men as disparate in their views as California Governor Ronald Reagan , Michigan Governor William Milliken , former Senator Paul Douglas . Educator Robert Hutchins and HUD Secretary George Romney . Ralph Nader has added the reform of property taxes to his roster of causes , charging that so much business and industrial real estate is undertaxed as to constitute " a national scandal of corruption , illegalities and incompetence . " As a result , says Nader , " small businessmen and the owners of houses are paying nearly one-third more in taxes to meet local revenue needs . " Prodded by Nader , Maine Senator Edmund Muskie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes in several cities this spring . <P> Tax assessments are erratic and often unfair , partly because many tax assessors are ill-trained and poorly paid ( average : $6,900 ) political creatures . About half of the nation 's 15,000 chief assessors are elected , but few states require any professional qualifications for holding the office . Flouting the law , assessors often appraise properties at widely varying fractions of their true value . The difficulties of challenging appraisals are so formidable that the assessors generally get away with it .
