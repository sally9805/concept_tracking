Oil and Trouble <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Congratulations for explaining the way the Big Oil Game May 7 is played . It 's easy to blame the companies , but it 's also a gross injustice . Only when people understand this incredibly complex situation will they realize the energy crisis is for real , and not a plot of the oil companies . The Federal Government is the worst offender in spreading the myth that big oil companies are ripping off the public . <P> Leslie Ellis White <P> Toluca Lake , Calif . <P> <P> The energy crisis may be real , but the oil companies and the OPEC nations are just ripping off the American consumer . They holler shortage and up goes the price . I realize there is a crisis , but President Carter and the Congress could take action to solve it , instead of sitting up in Washington drawing big salaries for nothing . <P> Larry G. Bailey <P> Shelby , Miss . <P> <P> Writer Chris Byron makes the oil companies sound like a charity group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody knows how to find the crude better than oilmen do . " Does this justify future windfall profits at the expense of the American public ? Business practices , like oil , should be refined , not crude . <P> <P> Kendall M. Jones <P> Palo Alto , Calif . <P> <P> Any windfall profits tax should include deductions for money spent directly on oil exploration and oil development , but nothing else , since the prime purpose of the new decontrol program is to increase America 's oil supplies . <P> <P> Philip J. Schacca <P> West Hempstead , N. Y. <P> <P> My only hope is that oil prices continue spiraling higher and even higher , especially in the U.S. Then some Americans might begin to think before they waste ( sorry , consume ) the earth 's liquid gold in their overheated houses and oversized automobiles . <P> <P> Detlef Hohl <P> Gauting , West Germany <P> As one of the " individuals who blithely go along wasting fuel , " I object to my use of gasoline being termed waste . By whose standard does use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A more appropriate title for your article would be : " How Big Business practices backfired and shot down the national economy along with the public 's trust in Big Business-in two painful steps . " <P> John B. Robinson <P> Huntington , N. Y. <P> <P> Underground Heroes <P> The remarkable efforts of Curtis Sliwa and " the Magnificent 13 " May 7 who volunteer their time and energy to divert subway crime should be commended . I hope I never need them , but I would really like to meet them next time I ride the subways . <P> <P> Suzanne Chazin <P> Tenafly , N.J. <P> <P> I only wish that other groups of young people or adults would start such patrols to discourage the crime that is rampant everywhere . North Little Rock has started patrols by concerned citizens , so all is not lost . <P> <P> Katherine Etris <P> Dardanelle , Ark . <P>
