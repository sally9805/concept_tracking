txt After a decade of striking change , the American woman is now considerably more likely to attend college , work , live alone , marry late , be divorced or separated , and outlive her husband than she was at the start of the nineteen-sixties . These are among the findings of an assessment of the status of women , based on new data from the 1970 census , Government surveys and reports , and interviews with Census Bureau analysts . Some of the changes continue trends dating back four and five decades . Others suggest new trends . Taken together , said George Hay Brown , director of the Census Bureau , " These are social changes of the first magnitude . Women in the seventies are rapidly moving toward full equality . " The changes in employment and education among women are among the most dramatic . Of the 13.8 million new jobs that developed in the sixties , women took S , 4 million , nearly two-thirds . As a result , by 1970 , more than 43 per cent of all adult women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trend dating to 1920 . The figure was 37 per cent in 1960 , 34 per cent in 1950 and 23 per cent in 1920 . The proportion of married women in the work force rose even faster , from a quarter to a third in the sixties . This is largely accounted - for by soaring numbers of women 35 to 45 years old who return to work after their children start growing up . Still faster gains were recorded in education . The number of white women with at least four years of high school climbed from 65 per cent to 80 . Among black women , the figure went from 40 per cent to 61 . And women with some college education rose 160 per cent , against 100 per cent for men . Other aspects of significant change include the following : 41The ratio of men to women dropped to its lowest point in the century . There are now 104 million women and fewer than 99 million men-94.8 men for every 100 women . The ratio is higher in parts of the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 men for every 100 women . But in the Northeast the figure is 92.5 . In New York City , it is 88 . Among people over 65 , it is 72 men per 100 women . gThese changes are explained by a lengthening of the longevity gap . According to the most recent figures , census analysts say , women live about seven years longer than men . In 1920 , they lived about one year longer . The proportion of adult women living alone or with unrelated roommates rose 50 per cent , to 7.6 million , about a tenth of all adult women . Women over 65 , some four million of whom now live independently , accounted for most of the increase . But women 20 to 34 years old in this category increased at the fastest rate , rising 109 per cent , to 800,000 . ( Borne of the increase in employment and independent residence is accounted for by a rise in the proportion of women who are divorced or separated . In 1960 , both categories totaled about 7 per cent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . This increase demonstrates that " a woman now can maintain herself without the need to remarry , " said Conrad F. Taeuber , associate director of the Census Bureau . qAbout 95 per cent of all women still eventually marry , but at a later age . After remaining stable for 20 years , the median age at marriage climbed half a year in the sixties to 20.8 years for women and 23.2 for men . Analysts offer a host of explanations for such changes . In the employment area , they cite the high demand for labor in the sixties and the changing nature of the structure of occupations . " The percentage of heavy muscle jobs  --  farmers , steel peddlers ? is going down , We are moving from a muscle economy to a machine service economy , " said Mr. Brown , the census director . " Opportunities are increasing . " This increase , analysts believe , has coincided with two other factors ? an increase in the number of low-income wives who work because of a need for money , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who work because of a need for satisfaction . Census experts cite changes among women at high income levels as strongly suggestive of the latter factor , since such women are much less likely to work because of economic need . For example , in 1960 , among the wives of professional men , only 30 per cent worked . By 1970 , the figure had risen to 41 per cent . " What we see here is probably true also among many lower-income women as well . but we ca n't document it , " said Daniel B. Levine , director of census surveys . " They may spend much of what they earn on day care , lunch and getting to work , But it 's worth it to them , to be able to get out of the house and have contact with adults , " Another employment factor cited by experts is the increased availability of child care and labor-saving products , like convenience foods and a wide variety of home appliances , which help loosen the wife 's apron strings . " The point is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can argue that , because many women now work , they create a market for these products and services . But you can also argue that , because they are available , more women find it possible to work . It is likely that both arguments are right . " The kinds of jobs taken by women have changed significantly . Three of every , four clerical workers are now women , against one out of two in 1940 . Women now make up 61 per cent of all service workers , against 39 per cent in 1940 . The proportion of professional and technical workers who are women has declined slightly , however , in the same period , from 42 per cent to 40 . As of 1969 , women earned less than men working in the same occupational categories . ranging from 48 per cent of the male average salary in sales to 72 per cent in teaching . But analysts say most statistical evidence does not validly demonstrate discrimination against women . Elizabeth Waldman , a Depertinent of Labor authority , said , " They may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings . Married women may not he in a position to accept jobs with overtime pay or to accept a promotion to a job with heavier responsibilities . "
