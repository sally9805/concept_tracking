&gt; A Texas surveyor looking for a boundary marker tugged at a mysterious pipe protruding from the ground . The pipe , a " coyote getter , " designed to shoot cyanide into any animal that disturbs its wick , fired a cartridge into the surveyor 's hand . An hour later he was dead . Such incidents have become increasingly common as sheep growers and federal agents have used more and more poisons to kill predators . In some areas , foxes , weasels , eagles and a number of other species have virtually disappeared . Now , the Environmental Protection Agency has banned 19 products containing cyanide , thallium sulfate , strychnine and sodium monofluoracetate . These poisons , said Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus , " represent a hazard to the public welfare through the indiscriminate destruction of our valuable wildlife resources . " <P> &gt; Brazil 's jaguars , tapirs and howler monkeys won a new lease on life last week when the government banned professional hunting . The law means that a dozen major skin exporters will have to close down . The authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting , including a list of permissible game . Notably absent : all of the big cats , monkeys , toucans , manatees and all endangered species . <P> &gt; The gray whale , once considered virtually extinct , is alive and multiplying in the lagoons along the coast of Baja California . That news was reported last week by Carl Hubbs , of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography . Hubbs credited the whale 's comeback to Mexico 's ban on hunting and its designation of a large lagoon as a whale sanctuary . According to Hubbs , four other supposedly doomed species are also winning the fight against extinction . The northern elephant seal and the Guadalupe fur seal are both doing well on the tiny remote island of Guadalupe off Baja . The sea otter now numbers " several thousand " in the Pacific coastal area . The Juan Fernandez fur seal is up to a population of 500 on the islands off Chile-mainly , says Hubbs , because nobody knows it is there .               @ @ @ @ @ @
