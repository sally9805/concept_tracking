It had all the ingredients of a made-for-TV movie . The newly appointed colonial governor of a subtropical resort isle is taking the evening breeze in the manicured gardens of the governor 's mansion . At his side are his handsome young aide-de-camp and his pet Great Dane . Suddenly a shadow comes to life , gunfire shatters the calm and the Governor and his aide fall dead . Even the dog lies lifeless . A state of emergency is declared , the airport is monitored and homicide experts are flown in from Scotland Yard . . . <P> At week 's end , this all too real mystery story had no solution . Police appeared as baffled by the murder of Bermuda 's Governor Sir Richard Sharples and Aide Hugh Sayers as they were by that of the island 's police chief , George Duckett , exactly six months earlier .

After a crime was committed , he did not discourage his police from wholesale roundups of blacks merely on suspicion that some might have been involved . On one occasion he publicly slapped a black suspect across the face .
