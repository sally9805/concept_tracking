Fresh out of Carleton College and fortified with a letter of introduction from one of his professors , Thomas B. Morgan came to New York City in 1949 for an interview at an earnest little journal of ideas called Politics . " You 've got a job , " said Editor Dwight Macdonald , handing Morgan a broom . " Sweep out the room . We just folded . " <P> This week Morgan will buy his own journal of ideas , The Nation , America 's oldest continuously published weekly ( founded in 1865 ) . The magazine has always been slightly to the left of American journalism , and often out in front . The Nation blew the whistle five months before the event on CIA preparations for the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion-to little avail-and published the first article on automobile safety by a young lawyer named Ralph Nader . Publisher James J. Storrow Jr. , who has owned the magazine since 1965 , put it on the block early this year , after the retirement of longtime Editor Carey McWilliams . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has more energy , " says Storrow , now 60 . <P> Morgan , 50 , is married to a Rockefeller ( Nelson 's younger daughter , Mary ) , has worked at Esquire and New York and , until last month , was editor of the Village Voice . Morgan says he will retain Editor Blair Clark , 59 , to write the paper 's editorials . He intends to raise freelance rates , attract more big-name political writers , and try to give The Nation something it has lacked for all but a handful of its 111 years : a profit . " My goal is to run it in the black , " says Morgan . " It has always been an independent journal of ideas , and it will continue to be . I have been thinking about this for 25 years . "
