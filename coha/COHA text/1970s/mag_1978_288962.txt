U.S. players triumph in Moscow competition <P> Twelve years ago , a young cellist named Nathaniel Rosen , then 18 , journeyed from California to Moscow to compete in the famous International Tchaikovsky Competition . Held every four years , it is one of the world 's most demanding and prestigious tests of talent in violin , cello , piano and voice .
