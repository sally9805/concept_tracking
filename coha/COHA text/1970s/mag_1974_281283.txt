Indonesians sometimes view their political power struggles as a kind of wayang , the traditional all-night puppet show in which the villains die at dawn . For four main players in President Suharto 's government , dawn finally came last week . All were generals , and two of them-Ali Murtopo and Sudjono Humardani-were members of the hated Aspri , the influential kitchen cabinet . One non-Aspri was General Sutomo Yuwono , head of the internal intelligence agency . The other was General Sumitro , boss of the security force Kopkamtib . Suharto stripped him of the Kopkamtib command and took personal charge of the secret police . <P> Not Mere Puppets . Suharto 's moves cut short political maneuvering by two dangerous rivals who had helped him topple former Dictator Sukarno in 1966 . Roly-poly Sumitro , a golfing partner ( " My stomach is my handicap " ) of the President , had sought to build up a following with students . When he was reported as favoring " new national leadership , " Sumitro immediately denied that he had ever thought of calling for Suharto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slip ' twixt cup and coup . After last month 's student riots during Japanese Premier Kakuei Tanaka 's visit to Jakarta , Sumitro cracked heads with such vengeance ( 800 arrested and nine publications closed ) that he seemed to be attempting to embarrass Suharto by exaggerating the extent of the opposition . <P> General Murtopo , meanwhile , was muttering about the laxity of law and order , warning student rebels that in the future they would " have to step over my dead body . " With these hard-line actions , both generals seemed to be trying to line up support from conservative elements in the military who were appalled at the students ' violent behavior . <P> By gathering power into his own hands , Suharto temporarily resolved several of his political woes . His disbanding of the Aspri was a crowd-pleasing response to student protests that his aides were corrupt . But the villains of Suharto 's wayang are not mere puppets . Each of the four wily generals is potentially a powerful political figure . They may now try to write a different scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
