The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk nosed into the waters of San Diego harbor last week to end a marathon 9-month tour at sea and to face a bitter post-mortem on one of the worst race riots in modern naval history . The sights and the sounds of the homecoming were mostly friendly , with helium-filled OPERATION WELCOME balloons lifting off the pier and mothers of crewmen 's children born since the ship sailed waving from a special stand . But as the giant vessel came to port , two black crewmen , framed against the disk of the radar screen , lifted their fists in the black power salute . <P> The outline of the riot was known before the Kitty Hawk docked : a six-hour-long melee in which sailors attacked each other with chains and pipes , resulting in 46 injuries and 28 arrests . The full details of the violence will probably not be known until the end of the current court-martial proceedings against 22 black crew members , if then . However , TIME Correspondent Donn Downing interviewed several crew members of the Kitty Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to the riot . One inevitable conclusion to be drawn from those interviews is that the trouble might have been avoided if the ship 's captain had paid full heed to storm warnings , which had been flapping for weeks and months before . <P> According to crewmen , tensions began to mount on the Kitty Hawk almost as soon as Captain Marland W. Townsend Jr . took command in June . Formal and aloof , Townsend replaced Owen Oberg , a popular commanding officer who was given to moving among his crew and not above on occasion going over the side of the ship in a bosun 's chair to wield a symbolic chip hammer . " He treated everyone as a minority of one , " explained one sailor . Oberg had a way of sympathizing with the crew even when passing out an unpopular order , like the frequent extensions to the ship 's tour of duty off the coast of Viet Nam . Recalled one crew member : " Ob would say , ' Hey , we 're going back and we ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was a guy up there who knew you were alive . " <P> Townsend was a different breed of leader . On the very rare occasions he was seen by the crew , he was usually accompanied by his Marine guard . He seldom went on the intercom to discuss events on the ship , and he was inconsistent in his policies governing matters such as hair length . When Townsend announced extensions of tour , one crew member claimed , he would say it was " a blessing in disguise . " In such an atmosphere , already tense because of the long work hours and few shore leaves , little irritations festered into permanent sores , and idle talk ballooned into wild rumor . <P> Some scuffling between blacks and whites began in early October . The blacks circulated-and believed-a report that the whites had hired a karate expert to intimidate them . They also took umbrage at a rumor that two blacks who had slugged whites had been thrown into the brig , while a white who had beaten up a black was given only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an enlisted men 's club in Subic Bay , where the ship was docked for resupply and recreation .
