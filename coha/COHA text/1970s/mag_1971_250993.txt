In heaven , according to the book of Revelation , the streets are paved with gold and the walls are encrusted with jewels . The myth persists in some quarters that the Christian church resembles that sort of heaven on earth . Tales of untold wealth are propagated even by churchmen . The late Episcopal bishop James A. Pike once wrote wildly in Playboy that the Society of Jesus owned 51% of the Bank of America . Eugene Carson Blake , general secretary of the World Council of Churches , has predicted that tax-sheltered churches would some day be able to control the entire U.S. economy . <P> For the authors of the church-as-Fort Knox school , the favorite target , naturally enough , is the Roman Catholic Church and its prosperous American branch . Five years ago , Business Journalist James Gollin ( Pay Now , Die Later ) , a nonpracticing Jew , decided it was time to stop the guesswork and to start investigating the secret church accounts . He distills his results in Worldly Goods ( Random House ; $10 ) , a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Instead of a giant money machine , Gollin has discovered a religious empire that is decentralized , poorly managed and barely able to keep going at its current level . On paper , his estimate of the total wealth of the 48 million-member church is impressive . He calculates the combined assets of U.S. dioceses and religious orders at $34.2 billion , which is only slightly less than the worth of American Telephone and Telegraph . But Catholic assets consist mostly of churches and schools , which are costly to run and consume income instead of producing it . <P> Timid Grandmother . Most of the church 's small margin of liquid assets is simply plunked into savings and checking accounts-the " cigar box " approach . The rest consists of securities and commercial property worth almost $1 billion , which puts the church a notch above the Rockefeller Foundation . But this money is often badly invested . One bank trust officer scanned a diocesan portfolio and remarked , " If your grandmother were unusually timid , this is what she 'd do with her money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment . Gollin thinks U.S. dioceses are " perhaps the least effectual investment institution in this country , if not in the world . " <P> Gollin says the bishops are partly to blame for the myths about Catholic wealth because they keep money matters secret . This " famine of information " also exists within church councils . The bishops are misinformed about their own holdings and have plunged into ill-advised building sprees because they did not realize how poor they really were . Another victim of secrecy is the beleaguered parochial school system , which consumes 60% of parish incomes . Gollin says that new public support will never come until the account books are opened and the bishops convince taxpayers that the schools really need the money . <P> Decentralization is as much at fault as secrecy . In money matters , the chief pastors of the country 's 18,244 parishes are largely autonomous . Even central purchasing plans for dioceses are surprisingly rare . One diocese saved $241,000 a year just by consolidating parish insurance policies .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
