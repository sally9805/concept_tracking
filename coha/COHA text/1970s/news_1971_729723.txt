txt The Canadian Government announced tonight a program of increased Government spending of $375-million and temporary reductions in personal income taxes and the corporation tax to spur the lagging economy . The program was presented at an emergency debate in Parliament called after the release earlier in the day of figures showing Canada 's unemployment at 7.1 per cent of the work force in September , up from 6.5 per cent in August . The level was the highest for any September since 1961 . The announcement of the unemployment figures this morning spurred demands by the opposition Conservative and New Democratic parties that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau take action to stave off hardship this winter . When the nation 's statistical bureau , Statistics Canada , announced the figures , some Government officials privately blamed President Nixon 's 10 per cent surcharge on imports for the rise in the unemployment rate . But Robert L. Stanford , Conservative party leader , accused Mr. Trudeau of failing to stimulate the economy , which , he said had begun to lag months before Mr. Nixon imposed additional import duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Democrats , agreed and said the Government had mismanaged the economy . United States policies are only making a bad situation worse , he said . The Opposition leaders demanded the emergency session tonight at which Finance Minister Edgar . J. Benson announced the Government program intended to spur the economy . He said it would include the following measures : 11Grants of $100-million to cities and communities to finance " labor-intensive projects . " Localities will be called upon to propose these workcreating projects . 9Government grants of $20-million for on-the-job training in industries with emphasis on giving young people skills . $15-million more will be allocated to an expansion of existing manpower training programs . 9A $160-million special program of loans to provinces and cities to finance job-creating capital projects  --  highways and buildings : $80-million program by the Federal agenciesrembracing maintenance and improvement projects. ? 9The Federal Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation would " accelerate " $113-million in loans for public , homeowner and student housing and for sewage treatment and land projects . 9Fersonal income taxes will be cut by 3 per cent , retroactive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 per cent , also retroactive to July 1 . The reductions would be in effect through Dec. 31 , 1972 . Mr. Stanfield ridiculed the measures as inadequate . He said that the 7 per cent cut in corporation taxes would do little to create jobs because it would last only 18 months and that the cut in individual taxes came too late to be effective . He said Mr. Benson should have incorporated it in his regular budget message last June . Mr. Lewis said the government would be lucky to create 30,000 to 40,000 new jobs to counter a possible unemployed total of 800,000 this winter . The Canadian unemployment figure , like ? that of the United States , is seasonally adjusted . The American figure for September was 6 per cent , compared with 6.1 per cent in August . Unemployment in Canada , however , has long been higher than that of the United States . While the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose , the number of people out of work dropped by 21,000 to 434 , - 000 , Statistics Canada reported today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August and September ; hence , the rise in the seasonally adjusted rate , which indicates the ' over-all trend in unemployment . The seasonal factors include such temporary influences as a higher student work force in the summer and a drop in construction in the winter .
