The latest series of French nuclear tests in the South Pacific , Australia 's liberal daily the Australian declared last week , was " committed by a national leadership which displays the moral sense of a gang of street bashers . " The words were blunter than most , but the sentiment was echoed around much of the world . After the French detonated their first bomb of the series two weeks ago at the lonely atoll of Mururoa , about 750 miles southeast of Tahiti , Peru broke off diplomatic relations with France . Last week 13 other nations , including Australia , Japan and Canada , sent protests to Paris . <P> The U.S. has ordinarily sent its " regrets " about French tests , but this time it has not joined the protesters . State Department officials said they could hardly protest to Paris when they had not criticized China , which detonated an even larger bomb in the atmosphere late in June . The U.S. , the Soviet Union and Britain have not held such tests since 1963 , when they signed the nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination of the air . France and China have not signed that treaty . <P> The tide of opposition to France 's atmospheric testing has been growing for months . In May the Australian Council of Trade Unions ordered all French goods coming into the country embargoed at the country 's ports ( it lifted the ban only occasionally to allow distribution of cargoes like Camembert cheese that threatened to befoul Melbourne 's port ) . Mail service with France has been cut off , and at least one restaurant put a sign in its window announcing that it would not serve French customers . The International Court of Justice at The Hague had handed down a temporary injunction against the tests in June , but France ignored the order . <P> New Zealand has sent a frigate , with Minister of Mines and Immigration Fraser Colman on board , into the testing area , where it has observed the tests from an upwind position . French warships have not disturbed it . A private schooner , the Fri , also sailed into the area to protest , but French sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , of Sausalito , Calif. , and his 15 passengers off to the island of Hao . In Hiroshima , 130 victims of the first atomic blast marched in silent protest . <P> The protests have not deterred the French government . The series is expected to run through August and include five or six tests . The tests have evoked surprisingly little controversy in France itself . When the Bishop of Orleans publicly castigated the government 's nuclear armament policy last week , Admiral Marc de Joybert , naval chief of staff , haughtily told the bishop in an open letter to Le Figaro : " Take care of your own onions . Your job , Monsignor , is to teach the faith and spread charity . Our role is to defend France . " For the time being at least , the French public seemed more concerned with the battle between the bishop and the admiral than with the contaminated winds sweeping the Pacific .
