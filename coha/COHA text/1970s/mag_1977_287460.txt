In an area where the living had been easy , life was suddenly a chore . The same wild weather conditions that had isolated Buffalo in the snow-and frozen Florida 's oranges-had also aggravated the 13-month drought that has plagued eight Western states . A high-pressure system lay off the West Coast , diverting winds northward to pick up arctic cold and blocking the normal flow of moisture to the West . In California , the loss in crops and other agricultural production may exceed $1 billion , and the water shortage is already affecting daily living in some unlikely places . One is Marin County , an affluent , scenic suburban area just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco . <P> Dry Life . Marin has plenty of water - all the wrong kind . Its peninsula affords magnificent views of the Pacific , San Pablo Bay and Drakes Bay . But the county 's fresh-water reservoirs are inadequate . For years the residents have been voting down bond issues that would have supplemented the reservoirs - partly on the theory that limiting water would be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water supply was so low that county officials ordered a tough system of enforced rationing . Depending upon the number of residents in a home , each individual will be limited to between 32 and 49 gallons a day . That is roughly enough water to flush a toilet seven times or take a five-minute shower . The cost , moreover , will nearly triple , from 46 per 100 cu . ft. ( 748 gal. ) to $1.22 . Anyone who exceeds the ration will be billed a punishing $10 to $50 per cu . ft. for the excess . <P> The result has been a rash of new habits . Men have been surprised to learn that a shave normally consumes 2% gal . of water ; they are no longer filling wash basins just to cut whiskers . Julie Graham , a San Rafael housewife with three children , uses a pail to catch the cool water her husband runs until he gets hot water for shaving . She carries it in a bucket to the kitchen to wash dishes . Then she collects the dishwater in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uses it to flush toilets . " I 've spent $30 on buckets , " she protests . " I 'm tempted to send the bill to the water company . " <P> Even prisoners at San Quentin are cooperating by taking unusually fast showers-and only three times a week , instead of daily . <P> State officials have asked restaurants not to serve water with meals unless a diner insists . They figure it takes two glasses of water to wash each glass and estimate the savings-if all the restaurants in the state comply-at 1 million gallons a day . At the Taverna Yiasou Restaurant in Marin County , Manager Beth Taylor has gone even further : she has switched to paper plates , thus conserving the water normally used for 25 loads of dishes at each lunchtime . <P> Last week there were sure signs that the residents of Marin County were adjusting to the dry life . They cut their daily consumption of water from 15.6 million gallons a week to 10.4 million , well under the goal of 12 million set by water officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district : " The response is simply amazing . The more we save now , the more we bank for summer . "
