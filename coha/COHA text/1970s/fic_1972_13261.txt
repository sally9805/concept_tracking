An election rally in Estevan , Saskatchewan . ALICE MILLAR , secretary to R.B. BENNETT , sings . God save our gracious king Long live our noble king God save the king Send him victorious Happy and glorious Long to reign over us God save the king . After this introduction , R.B. BENNETT appears . The cast , scattered as deeply as practical through the audience , react to BENNETT 's speech . Some are for , some against . All are vocal . BENNETT My friends in Estevan , in the warp and woof of the Canadian cloth which is our fine British heritage , our immigrants are the embroidery on our sleeves . We want to roll up those sleeves and get to work . Our country . . . our country , Canada , plunged into the depths of a great economic depression by unconscionable perversions of our great capitalistic system . . . by profiteers and speculators unchecked in nine years of Liberal Party mismanagement . . . Mr. King and his Liberal Government are not concerned with the spectre of unemployment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country today . 175,000 families with no captain at the helm. 175,000 frail craft awash in this sea of economic misfortune . Mr. King 's message to this fleet is , and I quote from his record in Hansard , April 3 , 1930 , " I would not give them a five cent piece ! " Men and women of Canada , Mr. King 's words are a small craft warning . Mr. King says to the men and women of Canada  --  and again I quote from his Parliamentary record : " I might be prepared to go to a certain length , possibly , in meeting one or two of the western provinces that have progressive premiers at the heads of their governments , but I would not give a single cent to any Tory Government . " Shame ! Betrayal ! We pledge ourselves to stop your betrayal in Ottawa . Nine years of betrayal ! It did nt take Judas that long . We pledge ourselves to foster and support a plan for greater Empire trade . We will set sail for the bright horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack ; that same standard , ladies and gentlemen , under which our brave fighting men fought and died in the Great War . With that kind of spirit , that kind of sacrifice , the spirit which is symbolized so perfectly in our brave ensign , we will reach port ! I speak for the Conservative Party in Canada . I sail under that standard and the course I steer is the course of the Conservative Party of Canada . Ask yourselves , why is the ship of state foundering ? Why is it awash ? Why is this country so beset by economic storms that its present government in Ottawa can do no more than huddle in the cove of political patronage ? Mr. King is not a sailor . The Houses of Parliament are not a naval academy . I am a sailor . At this moment , I think that the Dominion of Canada is faced with the greatest crisis of its history . We have the crew ; we need the captain . We need the platform of the Conservative Party of Canada . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want Action ! Action ! Action ! From the tumultuous cheering that follows and at another part of the stage comes a radio announcer 's election flash . p. 3 REPORTER Beep . Beep . Beep . Beep . Beep . Beep . Flash . The results of the 1930 federal election are : Progressive and other Parties , 20 seats , Liberal Party , 87 seats , Conservative Party , 138 seats . The Conservative Party led by R. B. Bennett have elected 138 seats and will form the next government . The cast may still be making its way through the audience to the stage . Everybody sings . CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . SOLO Grasshoppers eating up all my grain Dust blowing round , ai n't got no rain We got good people and it 's their belief What we need for the people is farm relief . CHORUS Looks to me we should all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . During the chorus , two of the company move into position to play the following scene . One of them holds a rope knotted into a lariat . FARMER Well , most of what I planted last spring has blown all the way down to Montana and most of the topsoil followed it down . Kind of strange the way a dust storm comes up . The rope begins to swing and continues faster and faster , creating the sound of wind . You look up and the sun is kind of hazing over , the wind is whipping up , everything on the farm , except the mortgage , is just blowing past you , out of sight . . . The cowboy throws the rope over the FARMER 's shoulders . For the rest of the scene , he circles him , slowly , keeping him at the end of the rope , getting him more and more entangled in the rope and finally bringing him to his knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get your neckerchief up over your mouth and nose , or get inside , but sometimes you ca n't do that because you 're on your way into town for food or you 're getting the kids from school . The FARMER sinks to the floor in a coughing , choking fit as the rope wraps him tighter and tighter . At last , the cowboy drops the rope . The FARMER looks up , brightens . But this is good country , though . My daddy got fifteen good crops out of this land and I figure everything 's going to be all right , just as soon as all this blows over . p. 4 CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . SOLO Children all ragged and they got no shoes And all we got is the farm relief blues Us poor people got to work and fret Cause the doggone farm relief has n't helped yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . During the chorus , two of the company move into positions to play the following scene . LESTER I 've been working on it , Howard , I know the farm has n't been doing very well these last two years , but I 've been doing some reading . . . HOWARD I 've given you two extensions already , Lester . LESTER Yes , but I can make something out of it this year . I can get a crop out of her . That 's good land , Howard , you know it . . . HOWARD Took over three farms in your section just last week . All of them useless . p. 5 LESTER You 're not going to take my farm ? HOWARD I 've got your file right here , Lester . . . LESTER I need another extension , Howard . . . HOWARD I got a letter in here from the head office in Montreal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two extensions . . . LESTER Goddamn it , Howard , that farm 's all I 've got . HOWARD I got no answer for them . . . LESTER I do n't know anybody in Montreal . I know you , Howard . Goddamn it , you ca n't take my farm . HOWARD Goddamn it , there 's nothing else I can do . I just want you to know , Lester , you 're going this week and I 'm going next week , this bank 's got nothing but equity in land that 's worth nothing . . . LESTER You 're going to take my farm ? HOWARD I 'm sorry , Lester , I just ca n't help you . LESTER All right . All right . If that 's the way you want it . . . If that 's the way you want it , I guess I 'm just going to have to beg you . ( He sinks to his knees ) Sweet Jesus , do n't take my farm ! p. 6 CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . SOLO Freight rates too high and the market 's too low We ask for credit and they all say no All start working at the break of day But we got no wheat so we got no pay . CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . During the chorus , JOSEPH moves out of the group to begin packing . As the chorus ends , his FATHER approaches him . FATHER Joseph , I know we 're going to be able to plant that bottom land , down by the slough . And if we send the livestock to pasture in Manitoba , if we send the cattle , then we 'll have enough feed for old Tom . We could n't send him , the horses do n't do well away from home , but with the cattle gone , there 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough for spring ploughing . . . During his speech , he enters JOSEPH 's room , notices and realizes that his son is leaving . He decides not to mention it , to continue with his plans , but at last he trails off . p. 7 JOSEPH I ca n't tell you anything about farming , Pa . You taught me , but I ca n't stay here any longer , that 's all . FATHER Where are you going ? JOSEPH Up north of P.A. There 's crops there and there 's timber . FATHER You 're not a lumberjack . JOSEPH I can be . FATHER You can work your own land . You 're not somebody 's hired hand , Joseph , all this land is yours . Your mother and I spent all our lives building up this farm . JOSEPH You do n't have a farm , Pa . You have n't had a crop for three years . FATHER Next year , things will be . . . JOSEPH I 'm getting out of next year country . FATHER You 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need an extra hand , for that bottom land , Pa . I do n't want to spend a year mending fences . I 'm going to make some money , I 'm going to save enough to come back and put this farm back on it 's feet , run it the way it should be run . . . ( JOSEPH realizes his own dreams are pretty weak ) I 'm sorry , Pa . ( He puts his hand on his FATHER 's shoulder ) p. 8 CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief . FATHER Sitting here watching my farm blow away Maybe it 's in Ottawa , I ca n't say If you get there before I do And there ai n't no dust storms , I 'll come too . CHORUS Looks to me we should all agree What we need for the people is the farm relief Looks to me we should all agree What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORVATH 's speech , which is heard from the back or side of the auditorium , the farm relief grouping changes into Mara Lake Relief Camp . HORVATH Okay , boys , I want you to take that rock and pound the shit out of it . I want to see gravel ! Everyone in the work camp has heard this speech before . They can sing along . NORMAN has discovered the task for the day is moving boulders from A to B. Everyone else is sitting around . SAWCHUCK Going to tell us times are getting better , Norman ! STAPLE He already said that . p. 9 MICKEY That 's the rock we shifted yesterday . He 's moving it back where we got it . LESTER This is different rock . LOWE ( To MICKEY ) I got a letter from my mother . MICKEY Oh , good . That 's good . So what , kid ? LOWE If I do n't give you the buck I owe you right now , I can send her three dollars . HORVATH ( Approaching ) All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeez , it 's Horvath . STAPLE Keep your drawers on , Bridges . MICKEY ( To PETE ) You 're playing poker with your little old lady 's money ? LOWE You dealt me in . HORVATH I want you to try a little harder for me , boys . I want you hustling . COSGROVE Government paying you twenty cents a day . Let 's show them they 're getting their money 's worth . HORVATH Let 's just do that . All of the men begin to move rock with varying degrees of enthusiasm . In addition , COSGROVE baits HORVATH with a lot of enthusiasm . p. 10 MICKEY Listen kid , you do n't play poker with your mother 's money . You got to have money to lose . Give me my buck . COSGROVE I hear R.B. Bennett 's coming out to the camps . HORVATH What ? ALL He 's unemployed ! COSGROVE He 's sure not doing much . MICKEY I wonder what that fine young lady 's doing right now . What time is it in Fort William anyway ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HORVATH Some people in Ottawa . . . COSGROVE Are a hell of a lot fatter than most people here . HORVATH Some people in Ottawa say that relief camps are just a breeding ground for political unrest . COSGROVE Just a hot-bed . MICKEY So I guess she 's helping her mother with one of those fine dinners . . . STAPLE ( To MICKEY ) Standing around doing bugger all . MICKEY When I want a job buggered up , I 'll ask you in to bugger around . p. 11 BRIDGES That 's buggered it . HORVATH ( TO COSGROVE ) I do n't want any trouble . SAWCHUCK Horvath , you got this camp running like a railway watch . HORVATH If we do have any trouble , we can bring the bulls in . COSGROVE Yes , sirree . LESTER There 's a science to it . BRIDGES To what ? LESTER Lugging boulders . SAWCHUCK Hoo-bloody-rah . HORVATH This camp 's set up so certain young men can do an honest day 's work for their keep . . . and a certain small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you say ? Because it 's slave labour . HORVATH Certain others , in the pay of foreign governments , are bound to take advantage . LOWE ( To HORVATH ) My mother says she hopes I 'm getting lots of exercise . COSGROVE ( To HORVATH ) You keep looking for Communists . This relief camp is the best thing that 's happened to Communism since Karl Marx . p. 12 HORVATH You do n't like it , you can get out . MICKEY I like it fine , Horvath . I have n't had such a good time since the Oddfellows took me to the circus . HORVATH I got other crews to check on . RED EVANS has arrived . He is watching the proceedings . COSGROVE You want to see a Communist agitator , Horvath ? A real one ? HORVATH ( To another crew , off ) You men , there . You 're building a roadbed , not a fucking monument . COSGROVE You want to find out what it is you 're so afraid of ? HORVATH ( Leaving ) Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friends . You 're here to work . EVANS ( Handing out leaflets to the men ) My name 's Red Evans . I 'm a travelling salesman . MICKEY ( Looking at his leaflet ) You 've come to the wrong place . EVANS I sell young Canadian men to Moscow . It 's all for the glory of the hammer , the sickle and the international Communist conspiracy . p. 13 LESTER ( He and MICKEY leave the group ) I knew it . EVANS There 's a story in this month 's issue of your camp paper . Says you men are complaining about the food in this camp . SAWCHUCK Just the ones who like to eat . EVANS You know what the government says about that ? The food 's fine , boys . You got cream of wheat for breakfast , hot cakes and syrup . LESTER Just like home . MICHAEL It 's pig slop . EVANS You boys are trouble-makers . MICKEY We 're in trouble , you Bolshevik bastard . EVANS ( Ignoring MICKEY ) You 're in trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got grievances , if you want to organize , you ca n't do it , you 're one man , you 're a trouble-maker , the government brings in the bulls . Your friend Cosgrove here tells me you had the town bulls in here last week . . . BRIDGES Breaking up a poker game . STAPLE Mickey there went haywire . SAWCHUCK Ai n't the way I heard it . p. 14 STAPLE Just a jack-knife carpenter , fucked and far from home . MICKEY I was drunk . LOWE Man 's got a right to be drunk . MICKEY I was really drunk . SAWCHUCK On twenty cents a day ? LESTER Sawchuck , you 're crazy , come on . . . COSGROVE Red Evans came all the way up here from Princeton , least you can do is listen to him , honest to Pete . . . EVANS You men know about the Relief Camp Worker 's Union . We 're working for you . We 've been working in Vancouver all winter . We 've been going into camps to find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to listen to you . You want a decent wage , you want work that means something . There are people in Vancouver who understand that . LESTER Yeah , Reds . BRIDGES I do n't know . . . EVANS They 're your people . They 're like your folks back home . We got a family in Vancouver that 's going to work for you . For decent wages , for a chance to build something that means something . This is rich country boys , we 're all part of it . We 're going to give you a chance to be part of it again . p. 15 SAWCHUCK You boys happy here ? You like sweating your balls off for twenty cents a day ? LOWE No ! LESTER Nick . . . ! MICKEY The thing I hate about all this union shit is all the stupid questions . BRIDGES What else is there ? MICKEY That 's another stupid question . EVANS The government wants to keep you in these camps , boys . They want you where you ca n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force you into slave labor in a god-forsaken corner of God 's country where the people of Canada can forget what 's happening to you . LOWE He 's right . Goddamn it , he 's right . SAWCHUCK Sure he 's right . I 'm fed up to here . EVANS The Defense Department tells you it 's not going to listen to you . The people of Canada , that 's your friends and your families , they 'll listen . We 're going to the people . BRIDGES How ? STAPLE Where ? EVANS We 're going to Vancouver . p. 16 SAWCHUCK I 'm going to Vancouver . LESTER ( To NICK , as he carries him back to the rock pile ) You 're not going anywhere , you crazy bastard . MICKEY Last time I was in Vancouver , the railway bulls beat my head in . EVANS We 're going on strike . LOWE I 'm going to Vancouver . EVANS Atta boy ! It 's April 2nd , right ? You got paid yesterday . Twenty cents a day for a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing to stop us , we 're going to move . SAWCHUCK ( Lugging NORMAN back ) I 'm walking out of here and you 're coming with me . MICKEY I 'm not listening to this shit . COSGROVE What about your shit ? MICKEY I eat it . That 's been going on for years . LESTER ( Pushing NICK back ) Sawchuck , there is something gone wrong with your head ! BRIDGES This could get us in a lot of trouble . . . p. 17 COSGROVE This guy 's the best friend you 're ever going to have . . . MICKEY You go to Vancouver with him , you 're going to march down the street in front of him , give the cops something to shoot at . EVANS We 're going to Vancouver . SAWCHUCK ( To NORMAN ) There 's nothing wrong with me , my friend , I 've just been here too long . Are you coming with me , Ed ? STAPLE Sure . Why not ? I said I was . MICKEY Stupid bastard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MICKEY No one 's going to listen to you . Nothing 's going to happen . BRIDGES Nothing 's happening here . SAWCHUCK We 'll go to Vancouver . We 'll win this one for Mickey . We 'll tell them all about the boys we left behind . MICKEY Fuck you . COSGROVE is organizing everyone who is going . He has a real live wire in PETE LOWE . COSGROVE All right , why are we going to Vancouver ? ( No reply ) That 's right . . . work . What else do we want ? p. 18 LOWE Money ! Money ! COSGROVE That 's right , wages ! You 're a real live wire , are n't you Pete ? LOWE Wait till my mother hears about this . COSGROVE ( Making a chant , which the others join ) We want work and wages . We want . Work and wages . We want . Work and and wages . NORMAN , watching the departing group , throws his hat to the floor in frustration . LESTER Ah , Jeez , Nick ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY . " The group , joined by MICKEY and NORMAN , wheel into a kind of cadet chorus line , their caps under their arms . They sing : Land of hope and glory Mother of the free How shall we extoll thee Who are born of thee Wider still and wider Shall thy bounds be set God who made thee mighty Make thee mightier yet God who made thee mighty Make thee mightier yet . R. B. BENNETT enters the Imperial Conference . " LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY " is his favourite song so the choir hums the chorus through again . During the hum , BENNETT begins to speak . p. 19 BENNETT It is a proud day for Canada , for in its capital city are gathered delegates from throughout the empire , empowered to speak for one quarter of the earth 's population and instructed to co-operate in delivering a plan by which this great empire may continue its leadership among nations . I cast my mind back to the beginning of this conference and the dedication service in the Memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorates Canada 's part in the Great War . The names of 68,000 of her glorious dead are recorded within those walls . They are only a part of the vast army of our Imperial dead . When that altar was dedicated , in 1927 , the then Premier of England , who was present then , as now , made a striking address . He quoted Socrates before his judges : " Now we go our ways . I to die and you to live . But which is better , God only knows . " Now we are sure it is better to live . ( To the choir ) Thank you , boys . They file off . Who could see the brilliant assemblage gathered here in Ottawa without flushing , swelling with pride ? This company of noble men of splendid purpose is a fresh breeze in the storm of economic ills which sweeps and eddies over all the nations . These fresh breezes will lead us to a cloudless day , smooth sailing , fair winds . The great brotherhood of nations which is the Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominions . . . The rest of the cast , representing Commonwealth delegates , begin to harass BENNETT and interrupt his speech . p. 20 FREE STATE The Dominions and the Irish Free State . BENNETT The Dominions , tied to the mother country by that sterling and sovereign example of brotherhood , our sacred trust , the British Commonwealth of Nations . . . FREE STATE The Irish Free State will not bargain with the British oppressor . We object . BENNETT We shall see Jerusalem , the Scripture has it . Truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun , the Scripture has it . For lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone , the flowers appear on the earth and the time of the singing of birds is come , the Scripture has it . STRAITS SETTLEMENT Straits Settlement objects to Scriptural references on behalf of our Moslem minority . BENNETT We meet in days when the machinery of world commerce is out of gear . International finance has broken down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to start those wheels moving again are in our hands . I speak of the retention of preferential tariffs . BALDWIN I had thought that we would lower tariffs . BENNETT Oh , I speak of new preferential tariffs in some areas and I speak of the extension of the free list so that members of the Commonwealth can blast their ways into the markets of the world . Our Commonwealth ties are an obligation and a sacred trust . Britain buys too much wheat from Russia . She buys from Soviet sources , 21 per cent of her wheat , 32 per cent of her soft sawn woods and 34 per cent of her pit props . p. 21 BALDWIN Russian prices are lower . BENNETT ( Takes harassment and criticism very poorly ) The question of world trade is a very complicated one . If there were only one view , this conference would not be necessary . I think we can agree , however , that there is only one correct view , one course to steer which will give a stronger , clearer impulse to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it to you , but you wo n't understand . You would n't understand , even if you understood . CHATTERJEE Our basic difficulty was Mr. Bennett 's personality . RUNCIMAN He has the manners of a Chicago policeman and the temperament of a film star . They leave . During MR . BENNETT 's recitation , the stage is cleared of everything except his faithful secretary , ALICE MILLAR . BENNETT In the words of Kipling , that great Empire poet : If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue Or walk with kings , nor lose the common touch If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you If all men count with you , but none too much If you can fill the unforgiving minute With 60 seconds worth of distance run Yours is the earth and everything that 's in it And  --  what is more  --  you 'll be a man , my son . In another area of the stage , COSGROVE is addressing his boys , who are scattered through the audience . p. 22 COSGROVE You boys are probably wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look good . We could stay in the union halls , playing cards all day . But there would n't be any point to it . When we 're marching around Vancouver , people can see us , they 'll keep thinking on why we 're here . Just one thing we can do is learn to march a little better . And the reason for that is probably some people think we 've got no pride in ourselves , we 're beaten . And if we 're marching and it 's orderly , we 'll look proud . There 's a thousand of us down here in Vancouver now , that 's going to look pretty impressive . We 're asking for work and wages so let 's let people know we deserve them . Okay , let 's do some practising . The boys struggle up , although PETE LOWE is still enthusiastic . Sure . . . Pete looks good . Doc , Nick , Norman . . . good to see you Norman . Garth looks cock-eyed but there 's nothing we can do about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's good , that looks good , boys . Mr. Hold-the-Fort , give us a song . The men sing . CHORUS Hold the fort for we are coming Union men be strong Side by side we battle onward Victory will come We meet today in freedom 's cause And raise our voices high We join your hands in union strong To battle or to die p. 23 REPEAT CHORUS Look my comrades see the union Banners waving high Reinforcements now appearing Victory is nigh . By the end of the song , the tempo has been slowed down to a painful halt . At random intervals through the song , the marching formation is frozen , one man steps out of the group and we listen to his " mind-track . " For example : LOWE Cosgrove , I kind of like all this marching and the people waving back at us , but I got a letter from my mother and I do n't know if she 's going to be so happy because she thought I was looking for work down here , Cosgrove and I . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ca n't help it . Fifteen hundred men down here and all yelling " Work and Wages ! " And the people are all yelling back . . . BRIDGES Never going to remember the words of that damn song . " See our banner still approaching " . . . how the hell does it go ? STAPLE . . . do n't know about these fellows but I got a stone in my shoe . But apart from that , everything 's wonderful , sure , only problem is we 're marching and my left foot keeps hitting the god-fearing blue-assed ground . . . On another stage area , a spotlight , definitely a special , comes up on WILF CARTER . p. 24 CARTER Hi folks , I 'm Wilf Carter . I know you all remember the men who made the Calgary Stampede great , names like Herman Linder , Clem Gardner , Pete Knight . They were all roping experts and bronco-busting champions . As long as we remember those men , and as long as the golden poppies are blooming ' round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Canadian and I 'm going to sing a little song : The trail to that last happy round-up Is narrow and steep so they say But the broad one that leads to perdition Is posted and blazed all the way It 's roll on , little dogies roll on Roll on little dogies , keep rolling along Roll on , little dogies , roll on Roll on , little dogies , roll on YODEL Roll , little dogies , roll Roll you little dogies keep rolling along Roll , little dogies , roll , It 's roll , little dogies , roll . And the lights fade down . COSGROVE ( From the back of the hall ) Company dismissed ! Loud cheers . NORMAN , NICK , ED and GARTH race for the stage . LESTER We got four hours off . STAPLE Four hours . No meetings , no marching , no boxcars. p. 25 LESTER Jesus , look at that . That guy 's got a dozen or more relief camp sweaters sitting in that window . Those deadheads are selling their sweaters . STAPLE They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . SAWCHUCK Smell that ocean . The ocean smells more like the docks today . NICK , NORMAN and ED do n't mind . GARTH is not so sure . STAPLE What are we going to do ? MCRAE We 're going up to Pender Street . Chinatown . Good place for a good time if you know the right places . Fan tan games . Opium dens . Won ton duck . STAPLE All we 've got are meal vouchers . MCRAE Tong wars . STAPLE Say , you think they 'd take meal vouchers ? MCRAE By Jesus , I got a relief camp sweater , there 's a fellow in that store back there going to want it for his collection . SAWCHUCK You ca n't do that , Garth . MCRAE Get me enough for a couple of beer . LESTER You ca n't do that , Garth . Hang around a beer parlour . p. 26 SAWCHUCK Make us all look bad . MCRAE I was talking to Evans . . . STAPLE Sure you were . MCRAE He asked me to be a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . MCRAE As a matter of fact , I told Evans he 's got this trek organized all wrong . We 're acting too quiet . What we want to do is raise a little hell . STAPLE What did he say to that ? MCRAE I told him that in my experience , many of your enquiring minds in town will congregate in your hotel beverage room . I told him I 'd be willing to take our message to those folks . SAWCHUCK What did he say to that ? MCRAE You 're a cattleman , he says to me . That 's right , I says , and we know what that means . Takes something to head spooked cattle in a thunder-storm , break a bronco . You 're a veteran , he says to me , you 've seen battle . SAWCHUCK Thought you were tying your shoe-lace just as the army left . MCRAE I 'm a veteran . I was wounded . I 'm a pensioner . p. 27 STAPLE You know what I 'd like ? There 'd be a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl , maybe still in high school and we 'd stop to talk to her and we 'd walk down to the ocean with her and just look out over the water and we 'd talk . . . LESTER And maybe she 'd have a friend . SAWCHUCK You go down to the waterfront here , the longshoremen have just walked out . MCRAE Never found myself a really pretty girl . All my women built more for speed than for style . SAWCHUCK We should be on that picket line . LESTER Jesus , Nick , we 're in Vancouver . SAWCHUCK I know . And there 's a walk-out . STAPLE We 've only got four hours off . LESTER Look , I followed you down here from the camps , right ? I have n't been past Vancouver railway yards and the relief camp office unless I 'm marching in a line . . . SAWCHUCK We 've got no money , we 've got no place to go . Let 's do something useful . Get in a little excitement . LESTER No . SAWCHUCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , no ? LESTER I 've been in the camps with you . I 've been marching around Vancouver with you . And now I 've got four hours off . SAWCHUCK And we can go down to the docks . . . LESTER Red said we should have some fun . SAWCHUCK Okay , let 's go and break the bank at Monte Carlo . STAPLE I was stooking wheat last summer . I ended up in Winnipeg . I was walking down Lumbard Street , past the Y.W.C.A. . . . SAWCHUCK ( He is somewhat more sophisticated ) The Y.W.C.A. , Jesus ! LESTER Church . Girls go to church . STAPLE There was this girl . I guess I was n't watching where I was going and I bumped right into her . She was carrying a lot of parcels and I knocked them all over the street . SAWCHUCK You are so stupid , Ed . . . STAPLE But she did n't mind . I helped her pick up the parcels , she was laughing . . . Two girls who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standoff . The girls are pretending they are not watching the boys , the boys are trying to decide what to do . p. 29 STAPLE Jesus , look at that . LESTER ( To NICK ) Now , that 's Vancouver . STAPLE What are they doing standing around the street corner ? LESTER They 're waiting for a streetcar . STAPLE Say something . LESTER You say something , Nick . SAWCHUCK Tell her you want to carry her packages . NICK pushes NORMAN over to the girls . He is nonplussed . LESTER You girls go to church ? SAWCHUCK Oh , Jesus . The girls giggle . MARJORIE , who takes a while to wind up , pushes DOROTHY forward . DOROTHY You 're from the relief camps , are n't you ? LESTER Yes , I 'm a Methodist . DOROTHY You 're wearing a sweater just like all the other fellows we see walking . . . LESTER I mean , we 're from the relief camps . MARJORIE ( To DOROTHY ) I told you . p. 30 DOROTHY You 're out on strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess you girls know Vancouver . . . STAPLE ( Who has edged over to join the group ) What there is to do in this town . . . we 've got four hours off . LESTER Where this streetcar goes , for example . DOROTHY East on Hastings past the exhibition grounds . LESTER Oh good , the exhibition grounds . That 's probably something to see . DOROTHY We 're going home . LESTER Oh ? There is another standoff . The girls turn away but the boys are still standing there . DOROTHY finally takes pity on them . DOROTHY What 's it like in the relief camps ? MARJORIE My father says you boys are doing a fine brave thing . He says that only the people are going to set this country back on its feet and it 's time that the people got together to protest and organize . My father voted for Angus McInnis in the last election and he says the days of the two old parties are past . p. 31 DOROTHY What 's it like in the relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's just like a forced labour camp . My father says the government set them up so all the young men would be out of the cities , so that the capitalists could just make people believe that times were n't as bad as they are . My father says the capitalists are expecting armed insurrection and riots in the streets and they should be , the way they 're exploiting the people . My father says there is no wealth , wealth is just a way of dividing people against each other in the class war . Wealth is just a product of our labour . MCRAE Say , that little girl is making me thirsty . DOROTHY Who 's that ? STAPLE Oh , that 's Garth McRae . LESTER Garth says he has a meeting with Red Evans . See you later , Garth . MCRAE Say , I first came out west with the railway . I opened up the territory . ( No response from the boys ) Ended up hanging around a bunch of green kids . Acting coltish . ( Still nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . p. 32 DOROTHY Is Mr. McRae one of your organizers ? SAWCHUCK ( To DOROTHY ) No , Norman here , he 's the organizer . DOROTHY Have you been in politics long , Mr. . . . ? LESTER Politics ? MARJORIE He 's from the relief camps , dodo . He 's devoted himself to the class struggle . LESTER Yes . SAWCHUCK His whole life is the worker 's cause . LESTER Work and wages . SAWCHUCK He wants to go down to the docks , join the longshoremen 's walk-out . DOROTHY I think that 's wonderful . LESTER But we do n't have to do that now . DOROTHY Oh , no , we would n't want to keep you . LESTER Oh , no , it is n't that , no , you could help us . STAPLE You could walk down to the docks with us . DOROTHY ( To ED ) We could n't do that . p. 33 STAPLE Why not ? DOROTHY We 'd be in your way . You do n't want girls along , I mean what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets . Then where would you be , I mean if we were with you . . . LESTER You could tell us more about Vancouver . . . about the political situation . . . What I always say is , if you 're working for something , you 've got to know what you 're working for , I mean , working with , you 've got to know the ins and outs of the whole situation , what I mean is , maybe we could talk . During MARJORIE 's speech , at " It 's time for action . . . " , the set-up for the Hudson Bay Riot begins . It is done very noisily by RCMP officers . MARJORIE My father says the time for talk is past . It 's time for action and he and my mother and I are all going to the big rally in Stanley Park and my mother 's lodge is going to form a big heart on the hill and the heart is going to be all mothers . . . DOC SAVAGE Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store . Everybody get back to their divisions ! MARJORIE And they 're going to hold a banner and the banner will say " Mothers Support the Relief Camp Marchers . " I think that 's beautiful and I 'm going to help paint the banner . The Hudson Bay Riot includes confrontations between strikers and police , a lot of noise and confusion and the striker 's snake dance  --  they move quickly , arms linked together , weaving back and forth to avoid making a target for police . GARTH breaks out of the " snake " and the riot freezes . p. 34 MCRAE We were now marching past the Hudson Bay Store . Someone cries out " There 's no guards at the Bay , " so the whole column of men just turned left and into the store . This is Division Number 3 and they 're a bunch of smart talkers . One of the young fellows is standing on a chair , making a speech and all the girls are gawking at him . A girl screams . There 's a whole regiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside with them . Fearful . They all line up against one wall . I 'm standing , looking down the aisle between the glove counter and the stationery . There 's a battalion of police down there with billies . Our boys , they 're youngsters for the most part , are standing there like boulders . The police have n't even started moving yet . GARTH runs back into the snake which manoeuvres for a five count or so before he breaks out again . MCRAE They start to move . Well , I waded right in , of course . Yes sir , I 've always thought fast on my feet . Cowboy Jack Monaghan and I were always regular hellers for brawling . Two of them come at me . They 're both big . I go for the biggest one , put him out of action while I 've got the advantage of surprise . One . Two . He 's down . I ploughed him . A powerhouse . His friend has got me behind . I run at the counter with him still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with a twist in the shoulder muscles , here , used to call that the Winnipeg pile-driver in my fighting days . He comes up at me again and I rassle him down . ( Snake ) One of the big fellows picked me up then , threw me right through the air at the wall . Now that made me mad . When I get mad , the fighting gets serious . There was glass breaking . I was standing there and one of the boys runs at the bulls . Bounced right off and into a display case . He came out of it with the glass still crashing , cuts all over him and blood running into his eyes . Snake . Which continues until a shot is fired . p. 35 MCGEER His Majesty the King charges and commands all persons assembled here immediately to disperse and peacefully to depart to their habitations or to their lawful business upon the pain of being found guilty of an offense for which , upon conviction , they may be sentenced to imprisonment for life . God save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGeer . I 've been forced to read the Riot Act because of extensive property damage in the streets , here in Victory Square and especially in the Hudson Bay Store . As the strikers trail off in one direction , a spotlight comes up on PETE LOWE . LOWE We walk around the streets at night to kill time , so we can sleep in late the next day . By doing so , we exist on two meals a day . What do we see while putting in the hours ? What do we think about ? We see a great many people going to shows , to this and that . Young couples , who seem to be enjoying themselves , well-dressed and acting as if the world is n't so bad after all . People who have homes and kids and all the rest of it . People who seem to have faith in the future . We think that something is wrong . We ca n't do as they do . We must go around lonely and dejected . No home life to enjoy , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . No hope in our young lives . We see wonderful things in the stores . Food ! Clothes ! Books ! And shiny cars line the streets . But none such for us . Outside looking in ! Or in jail looking out . Are we criminals , unwanted by society ? Are we lunatics who are to be shunned ? What 's wrong with us ? We think of marriage and homes , just like others have . Ca n't even have a friend or two ! Shunned like lepers of early times , we are left to our fate . Slave camps , jail or else the salt chuck . Because we have the guts to fight for our inherited rights we are put in jail . Called Reds and a lot of other meaningless names . We see . . . we think . We see red . . . and we think Red . Can you blame us ? Would you like to have us lie down like a bunch of spineless whelps and be contented as slaves ? Is that all our grandfathers toiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . letting her youth go to hell ! We who should be the pride of the nation are the derelicts ! The curse ! I leave it to you . Where do we go from here ? Where we go is to an area of the stage where all the lights available are banged up as quickly as possible , while any set-up necessary continues . The pace of the next scene is frantic . Strikers are in and out all the time for new cans and tags. p. 36 STAPLE I 'll put this chair here , Red . EVANS Thanks , Staple . DOC SAVAGE Table coming through . EVANS Move it right in there . ( When the table , chairs , etc , are set , the telephone rings ) Hello . . . Yes , Red Evans here .

The telephone rings and EVANS answers it . BRIDGES Say , this is tough . People kept moving me from in front of their stores . . . MARJORIE You 're the first ! BRIDGES Move on . Down the street , they 'd say . You ca n't sell tags here . p. 37 MARJORIE You 're the first ! BRIDGES Yeah , well some of them paid me to move . NICK enters at a run . SAWCHUCK Am I the first ? MARJORIE No . SAWCHUCK Oh . MARJORIE But you 're the second . SAWCHUCK Oh . PREACHER Is this the relief camp worker 's tag day office ? REPORTER I 'd like to talk to Mr. Red Evans ?

COSGROVE Volunteers for picket duty with the Longshoremen . Here 's a volunteer . But it is n't .

EVANS We 've been here in Vancouver for two months . We 've talked to Jeremiah Jesus McGeer , we 've talked to the Premier of British Columbia . They know we 're here , boys . They do n't care . They tell us we 're the responsibility of the Dominion Government . They want to play political football . Many of us are thinking we could spend the rest of our lives marching up and down Granville Street . Not the Promised Land , is it ? LESTER Came down here to get some action .

The lights come up on a Cabinet Meeting in Ottawa . p. 68 BENNETT The Minister of Trade and Commerce , Mr. Harry Stevens , has resigned from the Cabinet . I have accepted his resignation .

I would like to thank Mrs. Maisy Gilbert for leading us in that lovely prayer for the success of the Strikers Committee .

If possible the floor where the audience sits should have some open space so that those who do n't want to dance on stage can still dance . In this section , if the budget is available , strikers who do n't get dancing partners can continue to hand out food . The polka ends when demand seems to warrant it .

BENNETT You used to be in Alberta , if I remember right ? EVANS I have been in various parts . BENNETT You were in Drumheller in my time ? p. 84 EVANS Yes . BENNETT Where is your home ? EVANS Vancouver , B.C. COSGROVE enters , late . BENNETT And your name ? COSGROVE John Cosgrove . BENNETT Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . BENNETT And the next ? O'NEILL Stuart O'Neill , Vancouver . BENNETT And your name . DOC SAVAGE Robert Savage . BENNETT Where is your home , Mr. Savage ? DOC SAVAGE Vancouver . BENNETT And your name ? MARTIN Richard Martin , Vancouver . BENNETT And the next ? MCAULEY Mike McAuley , Vancouver . BENNETT And the next ? FELLOW WORKER NEILSON Peter Neilson , Vancouver . p. 85 BENNETT Does that comprise the delegation ? EVANS Yes , sir . BENNETT Well now , who speaks for you ? EVANS I have been elected as spokesman . BENNETT Yes , Mr. Evans , we shall be glad to hear you . EVANS We have a set of six points with respect to the relief camps . In the first place , the relief camp situation in British Columbia presents an absolutely hopeless outlook for the men in these relief camps , for the youth . Some of them in British Columbia have not in three years been inside the four walls of a home . We find conditions have only been improved through organization . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacklisted . What it really amounts to is blacklisted into starvation . Our organization , the Worker 's Unity League . . . BENNETT What is the name of the League ? EVANS The Worker 's Unity League , called a conference since blacklisting had increased . One case is that of McCauley . He was distributing literature in the camps on the Princeton Road , working class literature . BENNETT Communist literature ? p. 86 EVANS Not necessarily Communist literature . BENNETT But it was Communist literature . EVANS I say it was the Relief Camp Worker 's Journal which is not a Communist journal . He was savagely attacked in the evening by a representative of the Department of National Defence and by the Provincial Police . After two o'clock in the morning he was taken out of bed . . . BENNETT In other words , he got into a fight with a policeman . EVANS In other words , he was dragged out of bed at two o'clock . BENNETT Before he went to bed he got into a fight with a policeman ! EVANS That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got into a fight with the Provincial Police ? EVANS He did not . He was lying in his bed . On the basis of grievances like these , a walk out was approved . Our first demand is for work with wages , a minimum of fifty cents per hour for unskilled labour , union wages for skilled workmen . The present cost of maintenance of the relief camps is $45 per month per man . The cost of this demand would mean $60 a month and the workers would buy their own board and all their clothing . Our second demand is that all relief projects be covered by the Workmen 's Compensation Act . Our next demand is for recognition of camp committees . The rules of the Department of National Defence regarding complaints say that superintendents and foremen will discuss complaints with individuals . But when this has been attempted , the man has been blacklisted and chased out of camp . Our next demand is that all relief camps be taken out of the Department of National Defense , with no military regulations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for a genuine system of social and economic insurance . Our next demand is that the workers in the camps be guaranteed the democratic right to vote . They have been denied the right to vote on the grounds that they have no habitation and that they are being provided for by the government . p. 87 BENNETT How old are you , Mr. Evans ? EVANS 46 . BENNETT How old are you , Mr. Cosgrove . COSGROVE 35 . BENNETT How old are you , Mr. Savage ? DOC SAVAGE 23 . BENNETT Where were you born ? DOC SAVAGE Birkenhead , England . BENNETT Where were you born , Mr. Cosgrove ? COSGROVE Rothesay , Scotland . BENNETT Where were you born , Mr. Evans ? EVANS I was born in Toronto , Ontario . BENNETT You were born in Toronto , you say . EVANS I am sure of it , and several of my family ; my father was born there . We have been in this country something like 112 years . BENNETT And how old are you , Mr. O'Neill ? O'NEILL 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 88 BENNETT And the next ? MARTIN I was born in London , England . BENNETT How old are you ? MARTIN 31 . BENNETT Does anybody else desire to make any observations ? COSGROVE I am going to speak on the Compensation Act . Being first aid man in the camps , I have seen many accidents take place . In one case , in particular , Case 346 at Yale , B.C. fell 75 feet down a mountain side . He had a gash in his head six inches long and suffered 21 days with slight concussion of the brain . For 12 days he had no doctor . I had to doctor him . MARTIN We are ready to talk business on the six demands . BENNETT We have listened with much interest to what you men have had to say . With the exception of one of you , who has a record we will not discuss , you were born outside of Canada , and in the country from which you come , I was told the other day there are one million men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to single unemployed men who have drifted into the Province of British Columbia , we said we would provide one , food , two , shelter , three , clothing for such unemployed persons . We have given you good food , good shelter and good clothing . There was no compulsion and no discipline . The Department of National Defense operated these camps because they had the equipment , tents and they had the personnel . It was felt that if the men went into camps and did some work or chores they might be better off than receiving merely relief , and that they would get some exercise and keep themselves fit . For that they received the twenty cents as a gratuity paid by the state . Agitators went into these camps , agitators representing a form of government that we will not tolerate in Canada , agitators representing Communism which we will stamp out in this country with the help of the people of Canada . The Unity League is not unknown to us . We are fully seized of all the circumstances in connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where its agents are . They endeavour by force , if necessary , to destroy the institutions of this country . Leaving Vancouver , you illegally trespassed upon railway property , endangering human life . You reached Regina . At Regina , your numbers are now camped . Now you ask for work . At one place it was for relief . At another place it is for work and wages . You have not shown much anxiety to get work , not much anxiety to get work . It is the one thing you do not want . What you want is this adventure in the hope that the organization which you are promoting in Canada may be able to overrun government and break down the forces that represent law and order . You talk of Workmen 's Compensation Act . Every case in which a man has been injured has been investigated by the authorities . The case to which Mr. Cosgrove referred of a man falling is something which may happen to any man anywhere and may more easily happen climbing on a freight train that most places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your age , whether or not you think you are playing the part of good citizens when we are supplying you with the conditions of home , because you are homeless men . Now you suddenly say : We are going to violate laws and march to Ottawa . March to Ottawa for what purpose . What purpose ? p. 89 EVANS The purpose is to demand from you this programme of work and wages . You referred to us as not wanting work . Give us work and see whether we will work . This is an insidious attempt to propagandize in the press on your part . Anybody who professes to be Premier and uses such despicable tactics is not fit to be Premier of a Hottentot village . BENNETT I come from Alberta . I remember when you embezzled the funds of your union and were sent to the penitentiary . EVANS You 're a liar . I was arrested for fraudulently converting these funds to feed the starving . I say you are a liar if you say I embezzled . BENNETT I know your record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penitentiary elsewhere . EVANS I was never in penitentiary at New Westminster . You do n't know what you are talking about . BENNETT Where was it ? EVANS I know your . . . BENNETT You are here deluding a number of young men . EVANS I have stated that I used the funds for hungry people instead of sending them to Indianapolis to a bunch of pot-bellied business agents . p. 90 BENNETT I was referring to the second time you were sent to the penitentiary . EVANS Where was the second time ? I was never sent a second time to penitentiary . BENNETT Jail . EVANS Under Section 98 for leading miners in a strike . O'NEILL You have accused us of all kinds of things . . . BENNETT Nobody has told you the facts and I am trying . . . O'NEILL I have ridden in boxcars in France and I sat in a trench and nobody called me a foreigner then . COSGROVE I take exception to any personal attack on this delegation and will not . . . BENNETT Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be removed . EVANS Then the entire delegation will be removed . COSGROVE I will when I have said this . I fought in the war as a boy fifteen years old . I have the interests of this country as much at heart as you have . BENNETT You can not take the government by the throat and demand that anything that pleases your sweet will be done . . . p. 91 O'NEILL Two thousand men in Regina . . . BENNETT Who put them in that state of mind ? O'NEILL You did ! EVANS I propose we do not interject anymore . We will take the rest of what he has to say to the workers and citizens of Canada . BENNETT That is your privilege so long as you keep within the law and the minute you step beyond it , Mr. Evans , you will land where you once were . You were asking for work with wages , and a minimum of 50 cents per hour for unskilled labour . So far as that is possible , it is being carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suggest in your first demand that these camps be turned into work and wages , that is an impossible situation so far as the Dominion Government is concerned . Your second demand . No . Your third demand . Impossible . O'NEILL You could have told us all this by wire . BENNETT I am going on with this memorandum . In your fourth demand , you ask for no military control or training in the relief camps . There never has been . It was never suggested there should be . EVANS Military rules are published in every camp . BENNETT I am familiar with them . p. 92 EVANS You are not . O'NEILL There was military training . BENNETT Never under the authority of the Department of National Defense . O'NEILL What about Point Grey Camp ? BENNETT That is not a camp where military discipline is maintained . O'NEILL You do n't seem to know . They wear a uniform and carry rifles . . . there are boys in Vancouver . . . they are on strike with us now . BENNETT They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORKER NEILSON I am an old soldier , familiar with all forms of government . . . BENNETT The government thanks you . Demand No. 5 . No . Demand No. 6 . No . That is all that can be said . I want to warn you once more , if you persist in violating the laws of Canada , you must accept full responsibility for your conduct . EVANS And you also . BENNETT I am prepared for that . EVANS So are we . BENNETT In order that there may be no misunderstanding you might make known to all those who are with you , that they will be able to go back to their camps , and that as work develops on highways or on any other public undertakings , they will have the opportunity to work , but that a continuance of illegal trespassing upon the property of the railways involving the interruption of mails , the loss of life , and injury to property will not be tolerated . I have nothing more to say . Good morning , gentlemen , we have been glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another part of the platform . During EAST 's appeal , the Ottawa set is struck . Any representation of police are placed at the theatre 's exit door . This change can be as noisy as need be . Members of the cast in police uniforms begin to range through the back of the theatre , talking loudly , discussing tactics for clearing the area . Probably just before EAST 's appeal for funds , police drag him and EVANS from the platform . p. 93 EAST My name is Sam East . I have a pastorate here in Regina . I 've seen a lot of the boys from the trek in our church . When the Ottawa delegation came back empty-handed , so to speak , a lot of the local people agreed to drive the boys to the Manitoba border . We thought the March to Ottawa should continue . We arranged a truck cavalcade with the co-operation of the Minister of Highways here in Saskatchewan . We got a mile and a half out of town . We were stopped by R.C.M.P. , Federal Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols . I told them we had the permission of the provincial government to move on that highway . I was arrested . They say that any aid to the strikers is illegal under Section 98 of the Criminal Code . " Anyone who assists persons who are in unlawful association or assembly , in the way of transportation , use of buildings , food and so on , is guilty of an offense . " The strikers are not in unlawful assembly . I was arrested so Federal Police could take me off that highway . Unlawful assembly ? Sure . Most of the boys are over on the other side of town watching a softball game right now . I 'm glad to see so many Reginans at this rally . We 're going to ask you for money to help the strikers . We want to show the R.C.M.P. what we think of Section 98 . As the police move in , two STRIKERS at the door to the theatre begin to shout . p. 94 STRIKER 1 You ca n't do that , he 's a preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sound of breaking glass , screams . All from the back of the theatre if that is possible . There should be a definite sound threat at the exit or exits . EVANS is tussling with a Mountie or Mounties on the stage . Slowly , the police move down to the front of the theatre . The STRIKERS are calling : " They 're shooting at us . They 're moving in with horses . They ca n't do this , " etc . The police at the front of the theatre have batons . They strike them rhythmically against their palms . The house lights come up . POLICEMAN All right , folks , we 're going to clear this area . POLICEMAN We 've had a little trouble here . POLICEMAN There 's nothing more to see . POLICEMAN Help us along . POLICEMAN You 're all going home . POLICEMEN ad lib additional dialogue . At the door of the theatre as the audience files out , the STRIKERS are handcuffed to policemen . They tell their own stories of what happened after the riot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , they went to their homes or back to the camps which were disbanded the next year , they went to Spain , they fought in the Second World War , they were arrested for vagrancy , they bought a gas station , whatever .
