Now , theRepublican Rumble <P> In just seven startling days . <P> Campaign 1976 gyrated wildly . The breakaway surge of Jimmy Carter had transformed the crowded Democratic race into what looked to be a one-man romp the rest of the way . Then an astonishing string of four straight primary victories suddenly revived the near hopeless candidacy of Ronald Reagan , throwing the fight for the Republican nomination into a bruising , free-swinging rumble . <P> Reversing roles , the party that likes to think of itself as the more orderly and dignified was now in chaos . Would the battered Gerald Ford and the newly confident Reagan cut each other up so badly that Democrat Carter could breeze to the presidency in November ? Sensing that possibility , would Republicans eventually reject both men and nominate somebody else , a healer and more likely winner , in Kansas City in July ? <P> The prospect of a convention deadlock was savored by former Texas Governor John Connally , a spellbinding speaker who hankers to be President . But it still seemed unlikely that the Republican delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldwater in 1964 and only grudgingly accepted Richard Nixon in 1968 , would give their nomination to a Democratic turncoat . It seemed far more unlikely that the Republican Convention would move to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller , still a pariah to the party 's dominant right wing . Yet Rockefeller will control most of the huge New York delegation ( 154 delegates , making up 7% of the convention 's votes ) , and he might even be able to determine the outcome . No one knows what he might ask for in return . <P> Reagan , helped by the ballots of frustrated former voters for George Wallace , moved ahead of President Ford last week in firm delegates to the convention , 365 to 294 . Sixteen tough primaries lay ahead , including nine in Southern and Western states where Reagan would normally be strong . Ford , though still a shaky favorite to win the nomination in the end , could not even be sure of carrying his home state of Michigan on May 18 . <P> The Reagan rebound inspired a most unusual scene in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after last week 's primaries . Ford 's face was drawn and haggard as he walked into his regular weekly meeting with Republican congressional leaders . " He 's been up late watching the returns , " mused one of them . Indeed he had-and the news from Indiana , Georgia and Alabama had all been bad . The legislators rose as they always do , but this time did something unusual : they broke into applause . At a moment when the President was down , they wanted to show their support and affection . Delighted , Ford grinned through his unaccustomed role as a loser . <P> The session at first seemed to be a mutual pep rally . " Anybody who gets the impression that we 're going to quit is crazy as hell , " declared Ford . Sounding like Knute Rockne at half time in a Reagan movie , he added : " We 're coming out fighting . We 'll be there in Kansas City to the end . And we 're going to win ! " The leaders applauded again .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
