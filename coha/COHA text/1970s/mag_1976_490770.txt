THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN the last year or so , the United States and the Soviet Union have added the civil war in the former Portuguese colony of Angola to the long list of local conflicts around the world which they have appropriated to their own purposes by supplying arms to the contending forces . In these situations , the two great powers customarily cast local factions in roles in a global struggle that absorbs Washington and Moscow but may be of little or no interest to the indigenous populations . A short while ago , however , the Senate , apparently breaking with this tradition , voted by fifty-four to twenty-two to deny further American aid to any of the factions in Angola . President Ford called the decision " a deep tragedy . " The House of Representatives , when it takes a vote after the holiday recess , is expected to decide which view prevails . In other crises , the White House has usually furnished a certain amount of propaganda to the effect that the faction receiving American support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the case of Angola these assertions have been largely dispensed with . This time , the White House has hardly bothered to claim that the faction it supports stands for anything at all ; nor has it raised any objection to the policies pursued by the rival Angolan factions . In fact , Angola seems to have been overlooked altogether in the American Angola policy . The Angolans are invisible to the Administration , which is able to see in Angola little besides the presence of Soviet power . As Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has put it , " we can live with any of the factions in Angola and we would never have given assistance to any of the other factions if other great powers had stayed out of this . " But it is Angolans , of course , and not Russians , who are being killed in the well-supplied , expanded fighting . . The Russians , for their part , are busy , consuming ten million tons of American grain while their leaders negotiate with American leaders on how to avoid nuclear war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States steers clear of hostilities in its direct relations with the Soviet Union but fights the Soviet Union to the death in Africa and Asia through the expedient of proxy war , was once called the Cold War and is now called dhente . The Cold War has been " cold " because neither the Soviet Union nor the United States has been under direct attack . For Vietnamese , Cambodians , and Angolans , however , the Cold War  --  and cktente , too  --  has been hot . In the last decade or so , the results of the policy of global intervention have turned out to be mostly ironic for both great powers . In the nineteen-fifties , the Soviet Union helped to consolidate the success of the Communist revolution in China ; today , Communist China is the Soviet Union 's most dangerous and implacable enemy . Also in the nineteen-fifties , the Russians found in Egypt a situation they judged ripe for exploitation ; in the nineteen-seventies , they were ignominiously thrown out . Meanwhile , the United States , hoping to " contain " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself grievous harm in Vietnam . In recent years , both the United States and the Soviet Union appear to have harmed themselves with their interventions more than they have harmed each other . As for the other nations of the world , they arc going their own way . For better or worse , they are moving in directions unforeseen in the global plans for liberation and containment . As if they were characters in a play who had thrown the script away and begun to speak lines they had devised for themselves , these nations  --  nationalistic , proud , jealous of their independence  --  have stepped out of the roles arranged for them by the great powers of the postwar years and have taken their diverse futures into their own hands . Pigeon Mumblers ONE afternoon not long ago , three young men from Canarsie stopped by the Meeker Pigeon Exchange , in Grcenpoint , on their circuitous way to watch the ponies run at Aqueduct . We happened to he in the store at the time , talking with Patrick Sottile , the proprietor , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heading for the pigeon coops , which are in the hack room , Mr. Sottile muttered something that sounded like " pigeon mumblers . " We told him we were n't sure we bad understood him correctly . " You know , pigeon mumblers , " he said . " Remember in school , the ungraded class , the yo-yos ? That 's pigeon mumblers . Actually , a lot of guys who kept pigeons never made it to the yo-yo class , because they did n't even bother to go to school , so when they talked they mumbled . Nowadays , it 's mainly a term to describe someone who fancies pigeons . A guy does n't have to mumble to he a pigeon mumbler , but you should watch out when you 're talking to a genuine mumbler . He 'll mispronounce everything , call a tippler a tiplet , or a teager a teaguh . One thing you got ta remember : when you get a real pigeon mumbler around , no matter what he 's talking about , agree with him . " In New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needs of serious-minded pigeon mumblers . Certainly every pigeon emporium enjoys its distinctions , but we feel safe in assuming that only the Meeker Pilb JANUARY 5 , 197 ( o geon Exchange  --  on Meeker Avenue , right alongside the Manhattan-bound lanes of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway  --  has a live bird in the front window named Killer King . We also suspect that no pigeon trader in town has more tattoos per square inch of arm space than Mr. Sottile has ( none of the tattoos have anything to do with pigeons ) or that any pigeon-exchange entrepreneur has a more relaxed attitude toward his work . A year ago , Mr. Sottile retired from the presidency of the Allied International Union of Security Guards and Special Police , and decided , at forty-five , to collect his pension and settle down full time with his pigeons . Mr. Sottile is a man at ease  --  far more at ease , certainly , than Killer , a pedigreed show king , who reluctantly shares the premises with a motley horde of birds , two calico cats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Prince . The cats have been standard fixtures since Mr. Sottile opened for business , last June ; the pigeon population ebbs and flows with the customer traffic ; and Prince , who almost certainly had a different name at his previous address , wandered in about two months ago . Prince gives every indication of having attended obedience school somewhere along the line , which makes him far better behaved than Killer , who lives in a cage with a nameless , relatively tame Great American Runt . The Runt seems well matched with Killer , both being about the size of respectable chickens . Their bulk makes them too heavy to fly , and their grandeur makes them not for sale . Killer is his most imperious self when he is perched atop a cardboard nesting bowl waiting for one of the Runt 's eggs to hatch . Some G ree npoi in pigeon mumblers who are familiar with Killer 's irascible moods say that if he really put his mind to it , he could probably hatch a baseball . As it happened , the Canarsie mumblers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to bother with , or be bothered by , Killer . George carried a small wire cage containing a bloc teager and four Budapest tipplers  --  or Bodies , as they 're known in the trade . This meant that the mumblers had come not to buy but to sell  --  something that Mr. Sottile naturally understood  --  but he let the boys hang out in the back room for a while before he started to conduct his business with diem . The front room at the Exchange contains cages , feed bins , a few birds , bulletin boards with race results and contest information , and a glass display counter with medicines , leg bands , and other pigeon accessories , but the real action is in the back room . Six coops there accommodate almost a thousand birds , including show homers and flying homers , show flights and flying flights , show turbits and flying turbits , and a variety of fancy Viennas , nuns , helmets , tipplers , and monks  --  about forty breeds in all . The birds come , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . A blue show flight looks gray to a non-pigeon mumbler , anything dun looks brown , yellow is gold , Dutch silver is red , red is sort of muddy , white is white , and black is hlack . The terms " show " and " flying " suggest that some birds are bred for beauty and others for their aerodynamic sldils . This explains why a show flight caught off guard in a sudden gust of wind usually looks pretty silly . When Mr. Sottile , who sells more flying flights than anything else , finally wandered into the back , the transaction was brief . " I 'm keeping the teaguh , " George said . " But you can have the others . How much ? " " Have n't I seen those birds before ? " Mr. Sottile asked . " Yeah , " George said . " You saw the mommy and daddy but not the babies . I sold you the mommy and daddy early last spring and bought ' em back in July . Here they are again . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good enough , " said George , and he accepted a ten and two singles from Mr. Sottile and put them in the breast pocket of his T-shirt . The T-shirt was inscribed " Maloney 's , E. 42nd and Ave . D. Bklyn . " George then placed the four Budies in a small cage along the wall , opposite the large coops . We asked what he planned to do with the teager . " Oh , we 're gon na let him go out at Aqueduct , " George explained . " He 's my smoker  --  a hot one . I liberated him one time up in the Adirondacks , two hunnerd fifty miles from home , and he makes it back in five hours . No , I do n't have names for my birds . He 's just a blue teaguh and he 's my smoker . " " Why did you sell those Budies if you 'd already bought and sold them once before ? " we asked . " Well , I sold them in the spring , and bought the parents back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies , and I sold them again today because I 'm a little tired of them but mainly because I 'm a carpenter and I 've been out of work for a while because I hurt my hand , and we 're going to the track now and I need twelve bucks to het a horse  --  Sip Sip Sip , running in the fourth . " Ignoring for the moment the unfortunate fact that the newspapers the next day showed Sip Sip Sip to have broken from the gate in last place and stayed there , George 's reasons for selling his beloved Budies accorded with the implacable logic that is the standard for most commerce at the Meeker Pigeon Exchange . Not long after the Canarsie mumblers left , for instance , two of their brethren , a couple of teenagers from Coney Island , dropped by the store . One of these mumblers , who explained that he had a plan for breeding golden flights , bought twenty-two carefully chosen birds for seventy-two dollars . His companion , who seemed less discriminating , paid twelve dollars for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flock of five hundred . NVIiy was he buying six more : " To watch them fly , " lie said . Every self-respecting pigeon mumbler , then , has his own reasons . Mr. Sottile , who has been raising pigeons since he was ten years old , understands this , and , as a consequence , asks few questions . He also makes few rules , with the notable exception of a caveat posted on a bulletin hoard in the front room . The sign says , " I DO NOT DUY STREET RATS . " A street rat is the garden-variety pigeon found everywhere in the city except in pet shops . Among pigeon mumblers , who will disagree on just about every other subject , contempt for street rats is a common denominator . Mr. Sottile invokes one other rule  --  an unwritten injunction that prohibits schoolchildren from hanging out in the store during school hours . This is part of his plan to reduce the population of genuine mumblers in the Brooklyn area . The plan is n't intended , however , to rob Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mr. Sottile opened the Meeker Pigeon Exchange , he put up a small sign on top of the building to advertise the store . The billboard can be seen from the B.-O . E. , and its presence probably accounts for the homing instincts of the upwardly mobile mumblers who long ago made the move from Brooklyn to Nassau County but have somehow discovered Mr. Sottile 's store hack in Greenpoint . No one at the store claims that the mumbler migration to the wilds of Nassau County means that there is anything like a burgeoning pigeon chic afoot in the suburbs , but it 's worth noting that Mr. Sottile has gone to the trouble to tack up a newspaper clipping next to the cash register which shows Yul Brynner nuzzling a pigeon . " Oh , you get a lot of interesting people who raise pigeons , " one customer told us . " James Stewart , Gene Autry , Roy Rogers , Henry Fonda . Also , Jerry Rosenberg  --  you know , So , what 's the story , Jerry ? ' ? and Dutch Schultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars a week just to take care of his pigeons for him . " The customer neglected to men-non Marion Brando , who , as Terry Malloy in " On the Wate rf ront , " knew a thing or two about flying homers . As it is , the regulars at the Meeker Pigeon Exchange tend not to have names like James , Marlon , Yul , and Henry but run more to Rocky , Gus , Carmine , Butch , Richie , Joey , Frankie , and Vinny . Lots of Vinnys . Because Mr. Sottile 's vocation is an extension of his avocation , and because his union pension gives him a satisfactory income , he does n't feel compelled to keep long hours  --  he opens at noon , and does n't open at all on Wednesday  --  or even to dicker very strenuously when he is buying and selling . One of his regular customers , a thirteen-year-old called Obbie Santiago , came in with a friend after school the other day and handed Mr. Sottile some change . " Here 's the fifteen cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mr. Sottile took the money but looked puzzled . " Arc you sure ? " he asked . " What happened ? ' dja get a call from my lawyer ? " Obbie said sternly , " I 'm sure . " Then he went into the back room with his friend . While the two boys were among the coops , Mr. Sottile noticed some birds flying outside and went to the front door of the store to watch them . IVe followed him , and he pointed toward a group of a couple of hundred pigeons on the other side of the Expressway . The birds rose and glided , whirling in a funnel-shaped mass , above a row of low buildings . " That flock there belongs to a customer who lives a couple of blocks away , " said Mr. Sottile . " And see that other flock , over there ? Probably a few birds from each flock will get mixed up with the other . " For a while , it seemed that the two flocks might merge completely , but they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been about Four hundred  --  it occurred to us that we were witnessing more sustained pigeon flight than we had ever seen before . " How high will those birds fly ? " we asked . " Those birds ? How high ? " Mr. Sottile hesitated for a moment , and then nodded in the direction of the pigeons . " Now , those particular birds will fly sky-high . " Up the River THE old curmudgeon , a notorious boulevardier and shunner of rustic districts , startled us considerably the other evening by descending onto a stool next to us at the Grand Central Oyster Bar  --  we were about to inhale a steaming bowl of oyster stew with cream  --  and announcing , " I have just spent the day at Hyde Park . Moreover , " he continued , as an oyster slid off our spoon and back into the stew , " I was part of a press junket , and I enjoyed it . I am involved in an outfit called TRAINS  --  the word stands for Tourist Railway Association  --  whose members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Pins , a former president of TRAINS  --  he 's become so busy running private trains for himself and other people that he 's practically given up his original career as a lawyer was approached by the Fellows at ABC-TV to run a special train of his cars to Hyde Park for a screening of a four-hour special , two years in the making , based on Joe Lash 's ' Eleanor and Franklin , ' which will he broadcast January 1 1 th and 12th , and Pins asked me to form part of his honor guard . This was almost , but not quite , the first train to call at the Hyde Park station in twenty years . The station is in good shape , because it has been fixed up by members of the Hudson Valley Railroad Society  --  these little towns upstate are full of malcontents who want the trains hack  --  but the station is now entirely separated from the tracks by a cyclone fence , and the Hudson Valley Railroaders , who were at the station to greet us , had to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disembark . The only other train to have pulled in there in recent memory stopped last September to pick up the winner of a Hudson Valley Railroad Society fund-raising raffle , who had won an all-expensepaid Amtrak trip to Montreal . The Hello , Dolly ! ' movie people repainted all of downtown Garrison , opposite West Point , a few years ago and fixed up the railroad station there for some on-location scenes , and now ABC has taken an interest in the Hyde Park station . It is a wonderful idea to have movie and TV companies interested in our railroad stations . Now that Grand Central has apparently been saved  --  although I hear that the Penn Central lawyers are mulling an appeal  --  how about a movie company rebuilding Penn Station in all its pristine Roman grandeur ? " " What movie would he appropriate for that ? " we said as the curmudge paused to order up a cool beer and a dozen Chincoteagues on the half-shell . " Why , of course , " he said , " that stirring tribute to American know-how called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did the press people like George Pins ' private train ? " " Well , yes indeed , although there was one man who asked me , ' Does this train run every day to Hyde Park ? ' Yes , ' I said . ' Hourly . ' I talked for some time to John Tibbs , one of Pins ' porters , with whom I have travelled over six thousand miles on the Pins specials . He told me he had been the porter on the private car that took F.D.R. to Quebec during the war for a conference with Churchill , and that the President and the Prime Minister invited him and another porter to join a penny-ante poker game on the train one night when the discussions were over for the day . Tibbs is a discreet man . I asked him if F.D.R. had cleaned up , and at first all he would say was that Churchill had won thirty-five cents . Finally , he allowed that he had taken a dollar-ten off Roosevelt . I also " The first knight among you to slay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus two thousand golden ducats . Void where prohibited by law . " ? ? talked to Joe Lash , who was on the train , and he told me that when he was writing ' Eleanor and Franklin ' he sometimes heard Mrs. Roosevelt 's voice in his mind asking him not to write about the troubles in her parents ' marriage . I date my own interest in the Roosevelts to 1912 , when my father held me up to shake Teddy Roosevelt 's hand during his Bull Moose campaign . " The curmudgeon ate three more oysters and took a sip of beer . ( He of course has nothing to do with cocktail sauce . ) " We were met at Hyde Park by F.D.R. , Jr. , who told us the family was really quite pleased with the film we were about to see . He said that his parents had met the King and Queen of England at the station in 1939 , when Their Majesties went up to Hide Park for the weekend . The Roosevelts threw a picnic , and the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.D.R. , according to his son , said , ' You just aim it at your mouth , and then keep pushing and chewing . ' Then an acceptable bus took us off , past a Chicken Licken shop and a flower shop called Plant Parenthood , to the Roosevelt Theatre , a movie house across the road from the Roosevelt estate , and we were shown the first half of ' Eleanor and Franklin . ' George Pins , meanwhile , took his train bark to Poughkeepsie , for rewatering and revictualling . I tried to buy some popcorn  --  I like to he democratic during my mass pilgrimages -- but was told by the ticket-taker he had been ordered not to dispense any . I hate documentaries , but this one was something else . I was quite pleased myself , particularly by a scene in which Edward Herrmann , as Franklin , teases Jane Alexander ( Eleanor ) at the breakfast table . She 's telling him about someone who 's coming to call . He 's reading the paper , and she thinks he has n't heard a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he repeats the conversation verbatim and says that the children wM be very interested in anyone with two heads but that she will have to prepare the servants , so as not to embarrass their guest . Finally , he wins from her a slow smile of recognition . Afterward , we talked to Jane Alexander , who was also on hand . Joe Lash told her that her spirit had really taken over the picture and brought out Eleanor 's light . " " Did you say anything to her ? " we asked . " Oh , I said , ' You make me wish I 'd been Franklin . ' Then we were whisked off to lunch in the Escoffier Room of the Culinary Institute of America -- the cooking school that occupies a former Jesuit seminary adjacent to the Roosevelt estate . I sat at a table with Harry Sherman , the coproducer of ' Eleanor and Franklin , ' and Dr. William Emerson , the director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library , and his wife . Dr Emerson , a Yale man , said that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is a daughter of the last of the czars and that Roosevelt made her the only six-star general in the Army , secret head of the F.B.I. , and
