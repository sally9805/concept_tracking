Come the second week of August 1980 , after NBC has presented 150 hours of Olympic coverage from Moscow in 16 days , an ex-college professor named Richard Alan Enberg could be as familiar as Charlie Tuna . The network is already assembling its field-level specialists for the Games , ex-jocks such as Bruce Jenner for track and field , and John Naber , Donna de Varona and Micki King Hogue for swimming and diving . It also has lined up announcers Curt Gowdy and Jim Simpson , among others . Enberg , however , will be the most visible of all , for he will be the host of the shows during prime-time telecasts. // Dick Enberg , 43 , who has a doctorate in health sciences , is in the first year of a new and expanded three-year contract with NBC . For more than a decade he has been the busiest sportscaster in the Los Angeles area , handling as many as 200 events a year . For 12 seasons Enberg did the play-by-play of Rams games over Gene Autry 's KMPC radio and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice of the California Angels . On Autry 's TV station , KTLA , he called UCLA basketball games for six seasons , announced Olympic Auditorium fights for three years and was for a time the sports man on two evening news shows . What 's more , he also covered minor league hockey , small-college football and hosted Sports Challenge for seven years . Since signing on at NBC in 1975 , Enberg 's assignments have included NCAA basketball , a few championship fights , segments for Sportsworld and baseball and pro football playoffs . His new duties will include regular-season pro football and pre-Olympic events . // " There were two big reasons for signing with NBC , " Enberg says . " One , the mountain is there and here 's the chance to climb it . Maybe I could become one of the best reporters in sports and be remembered as such . Two , here 's a chance to do something that is going to be the most monumental event in the history of television , not just sports television : the 1980 Games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indiana University ) and teacher ( Cal State at Northridge ) , Enberg approaches every event as if he were doing doctoral research . When he got the assignment to cover the WHA Los Angeles Blades , he shocked the team 's management by offering to pay his own way to the training camp in Saskatchewan to study the sport . ( The club paid . ) For out-of-town Rams games , Enberg arranged to have the team 's advance man save stacks of local newspapers so that he could pore over them when he got to town . // Enberg was still a full-time assistant professor of health sciences , with broadcasting as a sideline , when KTTV asked him if he could do water polo . He had never seen a match in his life and did n't know a feint shot from a knuckling . He watched five Northridge matches to figure out what was going on , memorized two books on the sport  --  and made it through the telecast . " I 've never been prouder of anything I 've ever done , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enberg got lucky . He was a junior at Central Michigan when he applied for a job as the custodian at the local radio station . The pay was $1 an hour . The sports director persuaded him to apply instead for the weekend morning disc jockey spot , which also paid $1 an hour . Enberg got the job , and a few weeks later , when the sports director left , he got that position , becoming a play-by-play man at 20. // But if the years since have led to professional success , they have also exacted a personal toll . Divorced in 1975 , Enberg now lives alone in a house in the Hollywood Hills , overlooking Universal Studios , the teetering " Hollywood " sign or his swimming pool , depending on which of his three sundecks he selects . He and a divorced friend , Stan Charnofsky , are collaborating on a book whose working title is It 's Over , She Said : For Men in Divorce . // Then there was the day that Enberg realized too late that a game was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rams-at- San Diego football game . While Enberg waited nervously in San Diego , the baseball game dragged on . And on and on . " First we dropped our scheduled coaches ' show , " Enberg says . " Then we cut the warmup show . I tossed out all my opening notes and then threw out everything else . Meanwhile , both teams were on the field below me ; they had the ball teed up . And at that moment , finally , the game ended in Baltimore . The engineer flashed directly to San Diego and I had maybe five seconds before the opening kickoff . I just took a deep breath and said , ' Good evening , everyone , and welcome to San Diego Stadium . The Rams and the Chargers ! Uh , the kick is in the air . It 's high , end over end , and ... this game is over ! " The bewildered viewers may have had a little trouble figuring out that he meant the baseball game . // For his televised Angels postgame show , Enberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on a big scoreboard for the viewers . Sure enough , one day he had just enough time to drop into his chair , smile into the camera and start talking . He sensed that something was wrong , but because he did n't know what it was he kept smiling and talking . Finally he realized why the crew was waving and pointing . Enberg said , " Excuse me , folks , " raised up slightly in his chair and reached down and grabbed the lavaliere mike that he had been sitting on . He hooked it around his neck , grinning sheepishly . " People said I never sounded better , " he says .
