A dancer 's spectacular defection leads to a U.S.-Soviet quarrel <P> When Soviet Ballet Star Alexander Godunov decided to defect to the U.S. last week , he could hardly have foreseen the fallout from his electrifying leap to freedom : a Moscow-bound Soviet jetliner with 112 passengers aboard grounded for more than 24 hours and surrounded by police at New York 's Kennedy Airport ; top U.S. officials at the U.N . and in Washington getting into the act ; the official Soviet news agency , Tass , accusing the U.S. of " political blackmail " ; and Godunov 's ballerina wife an unwilling hostage in the center of the turmoil . <P> The drama began early last week when Godunov , 30 , bolted from his Manhattan hotel , just as the Soviet Union 's premier ballet company , the Bolshoi , was about to complete a hugely successful four-week run . Godunov , the Bolshoi 's most charismatic star , coolly walked out of his room as if he were heading for a stroll , evading the KGB officer stationed in the lobby of the Mayflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , where he requested , and was granted , political asylum in the U.S. <P> News of the defection-the first in the Bolshoi 's history-sent waves of shock and apprehension through the 125-member Moscow troupe , which included Godunov 's wife , Ludmila Vlasova , a soloist with the company . At that point some ballet insiders reported that the couple were estranged and that Vlasova , 37 , was unwilling to defect with her husband . Still , angry Soviet officials felt it necessary to hold Vlasova incommunicado at the hotel . Because the Bolshoi has long been groomed to be the showcase of Soviet culture , Godunov 's flight was evidently viewed as even more of a betrayal than the earlier defections of such luminaries as Rudolf Nureyev , Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov , who had all starred with Leningrad 's Kirov Ballet . <P> Godunov grew increasingly worried about his wife . Believing that she might also wish to remain in the U.S. , he publicly pleaded with Soviet officials for a meeting with her . " I am certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I fear the Soviet authorities will force her to leave the U.S. without my seeing her again . " To prevent that , Godunov retained Attorney Orville Schell , who informed the U.S. State Department of his client 's belief that the Soviets would hustle her out of the country . <P> Two days after Godunov 's defection , a group of eight grim-visaged Soviet diplomats and police agents escorted Vlasova up the ramp of the Aeroflot jet . As the plane readied for takeoff , Port Authority police cars raced out onto the tarmac and slammed to a stop in front of the Soviet aircraft . Acting Secretary of State Warren Christopher had ordered the flight halted to determine whether Vlasova was leaving of her own accord .
