 | PS Guide to Concrete Reinforcing Concrete is like a stack of nies : In compression it has g strength ? 4000 psi ? but in ten it has very little ? about one-t as much . Stack up a pile of pennies and it will easily hold a g of water balanced on it . Tip . horizontally , the stack falls a s ? . But if you drill the pennies thread them on a string , tying ends so they can not separate , stack can be picked up . It ? even be used to hold up somethi . That 's how reinforced cone - - concrete containing steel rods mesh ? works . It combines o nary concrete 's high compress strength with steel 's fantastic t sile strength . To see how the forces of co . pression and tension develop in loaded concrete slab , bend a pink rubber desk eraser . Note how t ? concave side of the bend is co. pressed . The same thing happened to a concrete slab or beam as is loaded . Although you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper three-eighths of stressed RC beam comes into co pression ; the lower five-eight comes into tension . This is where an RC beam 's reinforcing steel Welded-wire mesh rolls out on the s. : base , practically ready to use . Intended for crack containment , wire mesh is light to give concrete much added structural strength . @#  | usually positioned in the lower half , where it can absorb tensile stresses . The walls of a water-filled cylincal tank react a bit differently . Water pressure pushes outward my all around , creating tensile stresses throughout the tank wall . r this reason a concrete tank 's inforcing steel is usually centered the wall . Here are three kinds of home ojects that call for reinforced ncrete : ( 1 ) light reinforcement to keep normal cracks in concrete om widening ; ( 2 ) heavier reinforcement to buttress concrete against ordinary tensile forces ; and 3 i engineered reinforcement to build safe load-bearing RC structures . As you probably know , concrete ; prinks as it sets . Hardened slabs of it curl as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly stop them . For an exception , see my article , " A Concrete That Does n't Need Joints , " PS , July , 1970 . Concrete 's thermal and shrinkage cracking is managed by forming deep control joints at 10-foot intervals or less throughout a project . Cracking is not prevented , but is made to occur in the control joints . Light steel reinforcement can be used to build a concrete wall or slab without control joints , one that wo n't develop wide , ugly cracks . Concrete floors to be tiled , as in ) lab-on-ground houses , often contain light steel reinforcing . It permits you to cast a concrete garage floor without joints . Small cracks that form will hold tightly together . All sorts of reinforcing materials have been used in concrete , including bamboo . Steel , so far , is the only practical one . The most common reinforcing steel for crack containment is welded-wire fabric . Steel mesh , as it 's called , is marketed according to spacing and gauge of the wires . Common is 6x6-inch mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightest ) . Sometimes the wires running in one direction in mesh are a heavier gauge than those running in the other direction . Easy to use , welded-wire fabric comes in rolls and sheets ( for heavier gauges ) . Roll it out and cut it off with nippers . It is n't costly , but crack containment is all you get . Mesh provides the 0.15-percent cross-section area in steel needed for crack containment . But a single layer of ordinary wire mesh is nowhere near enough steel to truly strengthen concrete . If you want strength , forget mesh . Add an extra inch of thickness to the concrete with the money you 'd otherwise spend on mesh . And provide control joints to take care of shrinkage cracking . But that garden pool , farm feed trough , small tank , low garden wall , swimming pool , and those onground steps all can benefit from true steel reinforcing for strength . To get it , use either reinforcing bars or multiple layers of weldedwire fabric . It takes some 0.3- to 0.5-percent cross-section area in steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the span . Long spans need a higher concentration of steel than short ones . The 0.5-percent steel figure is not too conservative for home-project reinforcing . On the other hand , designing true structural concrete ? any mass that could collapse and cause injury ? is no do-it-yourself project . So do n't try to dope out your own RC beams , columns , elevated slabs , bridges , dams , high walls , and the like . Unless , of course , you 're an engineer . Stick to safe , low-down projects . Good as its bond During placement , the plastic concrete mix envelops the steel . The tensile strength that can be added by the steel depends greatly on how well concrete bonds to it . Therefore , the reinforcement should be free of loose rust , oil , grease , paint , mud , mortar , and other bondbreaking materials . Light , tight rust is okay . Iron and steel scraps found around the workshop ? pipes , angles , channels , wire ? may be used as crude concrete reinforcing , provided they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebars you buy should be identified , as required by the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) . A single longitudinal line between a bar 's main ribs indicates a grade 60 rebar with a yield strength of 60,000 psi . Two lines indicate a stronger grade 75 bar with a 75,000-psi yield strength . Lacking lines , the numbers 60 and 75 tell the same story . No lines or numbers indicates the loweststrength grade 40 , 40,000-psi yieldstrength rebar . You may use any of these grades . Bar size and a producing mill designation also should appear . Rebars without the ASTM-required identification are suspect . Figure by formula Here 's how to figure how much crack-containment steel is needed to reach the 0.15-percent requirement for a joint-free project . Apply the formula : 12tP A 100 A is the steel-mesh cross-section area in square inches ( get it from the table on welded wire included with this article ) ; t is your project 's actual thickness in inches ; P is the percentage of steel required ( 0.15 for crack containment ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) slab out on your electronic pocket abacus gives : A = ( 12 x Rebars less than % " dia. are usually smooth . Larger bars are deformed , containing lug-like ridges to help increase bond . Always store rebars off the ground to keep them free of dirt , rust . AUGUST 1977 127  | 3.5 x 0.15 ) - 100 , or a steel cross section of 0.063 square inches . Looking at the table on mesh , you find that 6x6 No. 6 mesh provides 0.058 square inches per foot , almost what 's needed . Since it 's so close , it could be used in this example . A six-inch-thick nominal ( 51/2-inch actual ) driveway slab would need two layers of this mesh to produce the required 0.15-percent cross section of steel . Figuring for rebars is different than for mesh because bar spacing adds another variable . No problem . You can avoid higher math by using the following formula : @# S is the spacing between bars in inches ; A is the trial rebar 's crosssection area in square inches ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the percentage of steel desired ( 0.15 for crack containment , 0.5 for reinforcement ) ; t , as before , is actual thickness of the slab or wall . The formula presupposes a single layer of rebars . For a double layer , multiply calculated bar spacing by two . Place rebars running in both directions at the calculated spacing . For example , in designing a four-inch-thick garden pond with steel to resist ice pressures in the sides and bottom , say that you pick a convenient rebar size of No. 3 , and run through the formula . It becomes : S = ( 100 x 0.11 ) ( 0.5 x 4 ) , or a 51/2-inch bar spacing for 0.5-percent strength-adding steel . If you end up with a way-out spacing like 24 inches , simply run the formula again using a smallersize rebar . Should the spacing work out too close , try it with a larger bar size . Maximum allowable rebar spacing is three times the thickness of a wall or slab ? 101/2 inches for a 31/2-inch-thick slab . Minimum is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be using in the concrete mix . For prac- tical purposes avoid spacings less than three inches . Precise spacing of the bars a reinforcement gridwork is critical . What is important is ting the required number of in place without leaving any c ' Slight shifting of bar positionokay . The normal shifting tolerance is plus or minus an inch . not cut any rebars to clear pit and other obstacles in the casting . Either bend around them or space to avoid them . Steel rebars may be spliced with in a project by overlapping a tying . Minimum overlap for formed bars is 24 bar diameter . Thus a %-inch rebar should lapped at least 15 inches . . splice should be overlapped It than 12 inches , regardless of h diameter . Smooth rebars should lapped twice as much . The purpose of overlapping is to trans ' the tensile stresses between b : : Stagger the splices in parallel so they do n't all fall in one section of the casting . Welded-wire fabric needs to be overlapped at least one whole Er d spacing plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over lapped eight inches . Rebars need to be wired toget to keep them from being knocks out of place during casting . Do - with a tight wrap of soft No. 1 mechanic 's wire , one wrap at ea bar crossing . Use three wire ti at bar splices . Right position for steel In straight tensile-only reinforcing ( tanks , pools ) , put your reinforcement in the center of the slab . In structural slabs that mu$ resist bending forces , place the . steel in the lower half of the slab . Steel for crack containment should be positioned about one-@#  | third of the way down in a slab - 11/4 inches down from the top in a 31/2-inch-thick ( actual ) slab . Rebars may be bent , if necessary , to go around corners . Do it cold with a piece of pipe over the bar as a lever . Bend carefully so that the inside radius of the bend ends up at least three times the bar diameter . Also , the straight portion beyond a bend needs to be at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment to ensure that it gets are through , and under all reinto ment . Tapping the forms with hammer after a pour helps to had concrete and steel . Maximum aggregate size shod be no more than three-fourths the least spacing between neigi boring bars or between reinforcement and forms . If you 're anal ing a minimum 11/2 inches cleg ance between bars and forms . d largest size aggregate you shoal use in the mix is 11/s inch , m al practically one inch . Naturally , your reinforced cal crete mix should be proportioned mixed , placed , finished , and cure with strength and durability i mind .

Do n't exceed them without getting additional engineering . Do n't let anyone get beneath the forms , in case they collapse . Also , do n't remove the forms or put weight on the deck for a full month after casting has been completed . Any concrete slab ? whether sidewalk , patio , driveway , or garage floor ? that 's built on 12 inches or more of earth fill becomes a structural slab , one that should be reinforced . For slabs for people only . use the four-foot-span porch slab details . For on-fill driveways and garage floors that must carry heavier loads , cast 61/2-inch-thick slabs reinforced with No. 5 rebars placed eight inches on center in both directions . @# @#
