What 's a nice girl like Annie Hall doing in a film like Mr. Goodbar ? <P> Call Diane Keaton , the shy , gangly , lost-and-found soul who is Annie in Annie Hall , the funniest woman now working in films . Small praise . Give or take Lily Tomlin , it is hard to think of another woman now being funny in films . <P> Remember Keaton in the Godfather movies ? Not likely . She was invisible in The Godfather and pallid in The Godfather , Part II . She played Al Pacino 's wife , and her role amounted to telling Pacino every now and then to stop killing people so often and spend some time with the kids . Says Keaton : " Pacino was great . Robert De Niro was great . I was background music . " <P> That expresses well enough an oddity of the past two decades of moviemaking . Women , with a few notable exceptions , have been background music . The reason is not simply that Paul Newman and Robert Redford make a lovely pair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social realities and society 's perceptions . A male actor can fly a plane , fight a war , shoot a badman , pull off a sting , impersonate a big cheese in business or politics . Men are presumed to be interesting . A female can play a wife , play a whore , get pregnant , lose her baby , and , um , let 's see ... Women are presumed to be dull . <P> Yes , and yes . Is it possible , however , that films are beginning to see women through a sharper lens ? Or at any rate with a more interesting astigmatism ? New women novelists have begun writing about women as creatures who can make noises in the forest , even if no man is there to hear , and whose sexuality , in particular , functions without any by-your-leave from old social presumptions . Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone , or virtually so . <P> Among such films scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a study of two dancers , with Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft ; a version of Lillian Hellman 's short story Julia , with Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave ; and One Sings , The Other Does n't , a French work that will open the New York Film Festival this week . <P> Then there is Diane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar . As Theresa Dunn , Keaton dominates this raunchy , risky , violent dramatization of Judith Ressner 's 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars . Watching her is a shock for viewers who associate her shy and awkward manner with Annie Hall . She is on-screen for well over two hours while her character disintegrates in the direction of alienation and death . <P> Till now Diane Keaton has been able to wander down a Manhattan street with out drawing more than an occasional half-suspicious stare . She lets herself be kept waiting for two hours in a Southern California beach restaurant because the maitre d ' can not imagine that this tall , apologetic young woman in sunglasses and floppy clothes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
