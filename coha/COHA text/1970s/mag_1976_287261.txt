Gentlemanly and discreet , with faces like silver teapots , the better art dealers and auctioneers around London 's Bond Street have long maintained their immunity from the scandals of the art world . Circumspection is the motto , coupled with a standing policy-among members of the British Antique Dealers Association-to refund the price of any fake . Therefore , when the biggest art forgery scandal in years came to a head in London last fortnight , the embarrassment was acute . At a press conference , a rubicund , white-bearded cockney painter and restorer named Tom Keating , 59 , revealed that over the past 25 years he had flooded the art market with anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 pastiches of the work of dead artists , ranging from 17th century Dutch to Constable to German expressionists . He was , Keating blithely admitted , " a terrible faker . Anyone who sees my work and thinks it genuine , must be around the bend . " Moreover , Keating said , he did not mean his phonies to pass close tests : before setting to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a suitable rude word on the blank canvas , in lead-based paint , which would show up under X rays . Nevertheless , many of the works ended up in leading galleries and auction rooms , where , endowed with signatures and solid pedigrees , they were sold for even more solid prices . <P> Nothing was to distress the trade more than Keating 's versions of the work of Samuel Palmer ( 1805-81 ) , whose moonlit landscapes of Shoreham are among the most sought-after works in English romantic landscape painting . Palmer made some 80 Shoreham watercolors , oils and drawings ; Keating made 80 more-mainly by copying details of Palmers and cobbling them together . The first such " Palmer " was sold to a British museum by Colnaghi 's , a major Bond Street dealer , in 1965 . In 1969 another " Palmer , " titled Sepham Barn , went at auction to the Leger Galleries for 9,400 ( $22,560 ) , a sum that staggered Keating and enabled him and his lover , Jane Kelly , the 23-year-old daughter of a retired British army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane Kelly sold four " Palmers " to Leger Galleries , claiming they had been in her family 's estate in Ceylon . <P> One of them , The Horse Chestnut Tree , went to Sotheby 's in 1973 and was sold for 15,000 ( $34,500 ) , a record for Palmers , to a chocolate manufacturer in Hull . Sotheby 's still claims it has not been proved a Keating fake . <P> Gradually , suspicions began to hatch . More than four years ago , Leger Galleries had a visit from a leading Palmer specialist , Sir Karl Parker , who pronounced Sepham Barn a fake . When The Horse Chestnut Tree appeared in Sotheby 's , one of its former consultants , David Gould , wrote to Chairman Peter Wilson expressing doubts about it . But the scandal was finally exposed when Geraldine Norman , the London Times 's auction-room correspondent , tracked Keating to his lonely cottage in Dedham . " I have so much contempt for the dealers who prostitute the art of genuine painters , " Keating announced , " that I was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
