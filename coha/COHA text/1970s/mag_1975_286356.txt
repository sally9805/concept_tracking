Nearly 50 years ago , Virginia Woolf compared the situation of a woman composer to that of an actress in Shakespeare 's day - hopeless . Among the popular theories offered to explain the mysterious absence of eminent women composers was the biological : men compose symphonies , women compose babies . Sociologists point out that little girls are mostly encouraged to confine their talents to parlor piano playing . Though women have always been accepted as soloists , only in recent years have many conservatories trained women as composers . " Think of the thousands and thousands of men who have studied composing , " says Pianist-Conductor Bo ris Goldovsky , " to produce only about three dozen masters . Statistically , wom en may simply have to catch up before they have their Beethoven . " There are signs they soon may be getting their chance . In June Manhattan 's Juilliard School for the first time awarded a doctorate in composition to a woman . Bi centennial money and International Women 's Year have resulted in more commissions for female composers . <P> While still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few of to day 's growing corps of women who have successful careers in music : <P> THEA MUSGRAVE , 47 , has written chamber music , ballet and opera . " Music is a human art , not a sexual one , " she says . " Sex is no more important than eye color . " When Britain 's Musgrave talks about " space music , " she is not referring to synthetic sci-fi sounds but to compositions in which the players are directed to move about the concert hall . <P> Her Clarinet Concerto , in which the soloist threads a path through the orchestra , will be heard at Caldwell 's Philharmonic program celebrating women composers . <P> Musgrave is now writing a music drama about Mary Queen of Scots . <P> SHALAMIT RAN , 27 , grew up in Israel , began composing works in her head at seven . When she was nine , her teacher wrote down one of her songs , which was played on the ra dio . Delighted at hearing her own music , she started writing it out herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Philharmonic performed her Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic premiered her piano concerto . Although many women composers feel that developing their talent leaves no room for domesticity , Ran is married-to a jazz musician . It annoys Ran that on divulging her own profession , people sometimes say , " Oh really ? How cute . " <P> BARBARA KOLB , 36 , composer in residence at the American Academy in Rome , will return to New York next month for the premiere of Soundings , a richly textured romantic piece that blends overlapping layers of sounds . That same evening the work will also be performed in Rome by the Rome Radio Orchestra . Kolb , who grew up in Connecticut , spent six years in the clarinet section of the Hartford Symphony . It has never occurred to her that composing might be considered an exclusively male occupation . If anything , says Kolb , " composing a piece of music is very feminine . It is sensitive , emotional , contemplative . By comparison , doing housework is positively masculine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
