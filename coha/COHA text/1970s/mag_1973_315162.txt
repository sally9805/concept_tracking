President Nixon 's disclosure of his personal finances ( see page 10 ) revealed that he has only a faint impulse to contribute to charities . Millions of Americans with incomes far smaller than Nixon 's give far more . In 1972 , for example , Nixon donated-excluding the worth of his vice-presidential papers-a total of $295 to charities . On an income of $268,777 , this amounted to little more than 1/1000th of his earnings . His donations never exceeded $7,512 in any of his years as President ; his contributions for the four years averaged only $3,370 a year , or about 0.3% of his total income . That is well below not only the charitable practice of tithing ( giving 10% ) advocated in the Old Testament , but also the current rate among the President 's financial peers . According to the most recent statistics of the Internal Revenue Service , others in Nixon 's tax bracket made charitable cash donations averaging nearly $11,000 each in 1970 . <P> Nixon 's smallest donation was $12 , given on three occasions to the American Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his largest was $4,500 to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1970 . Many of the organizations that benefited from a Nixon gift were religious . Besides the Graham donation and a $1,000 donation to the Baptist Community Hospital in 1970 , Nixon gave $1,000 to his home-town East Whittier Friends Church in 1971 . <P> Someone else 's generosity is a difficult thing to judge . But his countrymen may be forgiven if they regard Richard Nixon-a man who has spoken so much about the importance of voluntary effort and private charities-as exceptionally tightfisted.
