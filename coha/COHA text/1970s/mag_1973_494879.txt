The Nixon Watch Ford on Ford The chairmen and members of the Senate and House committees that approved the nomination of Congressman Gerald Ford to be the next Vice President of the United States spoke often at the hearings on the nomination as if they expected Ford to replace Richard Nixon in the presidency and were deciding whether he is fit to do so . They never said this .. But there was in their comments something more and deeper than orthodox expressions of awareness that Presidents are mortal and that any Vice President may succeed his President . Whether Mr. Nixon will finish out his second term or will resign , be impeached and removed , or be declared incompetent to conduct the office while still in it is a subject of speculation and argument in Congress as it is throughout the country . Chairman Howard Cannon said that his Senate Rules Committee " should view its obligations as no less important than the selection of a potential President of the United States . " Chairman Peter Rodino said at the start of the House Judiciary Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning is an examination of a man 's qualifications and fitness to hold the highest office in America , that of President of the United States . " Congressman Ford , testifying before the committees , rarely bothered with conventional quibbles to the effect that he did n't expect to be anything other than a Vice President and answered matter of factly when he was asked what he 'd do " if you were President . " For a minor example , he said that he had DECEMBER 15 , 1973 advised Mr. Nixon to have press conferences " more frequently than he has " and indicated that if he were President he 'd plan to hold them " every'other week at the le.ast . " Believing what politicians say about themselves is not in fashion . Ford in his testimony of course was saying what he thought it expedient and prudent to say in the interest of getting his nomination confirmed with a minimum of trouble and opposition . But what he thought it expedient and prudent to say in these unique circumstances , the first when an incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disapprove the nomination by majority vote in both houses , told a good deal that 's worth noting and remembering about Gerald Ford now that he is Vice President Ford . Ford said his main reason for considering himself qualified to be Vice President is that " I believe I can be a ready conciliator and calm communicator between the White House and Capitol Hill , between the reelection mandate of the Republican President and the equally emphatic mandate of the Democratic 93rd Congress . " A reason for believing this , he said , is that he has come to know the Congress well during 25 years as a member of the House of Representatives from Michigan and eight years as the Republican minority leader in the House . White House Counsellor and former Congressman Melvin Laird , whose chief assignment of late has been to get Ford confirmed and has said he 's quitting the Nixon staff as soon as the Vice President has settled in , has also said that he expects Vice President Ford to be the President 's principal advocate . and most effective lobbyist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did and did n't think this a realistic view . Senators Lyndon Johnson , Hubert Humphrey and Alben Barkley discovered in recent times that their clout with the Senate melted away when they became Vice Presidents . Ford 's disgraced predecessor , Spiro T. Agnew , never recovered from the harm he did himself during his first months in the vice presidency when he presumed to tell senators how to vote . When Senator James B. Allen of Alabama asked in effect whether he 'd be a presidential lobbyist or " an impartial presiding officer of the Senate , " Ford answered : " . . . I would , without any doubt , be an impartial presiding officer . I think that is mandatory . I do not think I ought to say I would be a crusader in the ranks on any issue , as far as the President 's policy is concerned . If somebody asked me my views , I would certainly express them . If I am asked to try and work out compromises during the legislative process , I certainly would be available and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual Senators like I now have the responsibility of talking to individual House members . " He told the House committee that " I certainly hope to spend a substantial amount of my time in the US Senate as the presid- ) 9 ing officer . I do expect , however , that I will be doing some work while I am on Capitol Hill , trying to get legislation through a Democratic Congress with a Republican President . I think I can contribute effectively in that way . " Ford said he could n't imagine why people keep asking him whether he supports President Nixon on particular items and in general . He said his answer is : " Of course I support the President . He is my friend of a ? quarter century . His political philosophy is very close to my own . He is the head of my party and the constitutional chief executive of the nation . He was chosen quite emphatically by the people a year ago as I , if confirmed as Vice President , will not have been . " He added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opposed this Republican President and Democratic Presidents " when ' I thought they were wrong " ; and then said : " To be honest , I imagine that as Vice President you do your Presidential criticizing a little more privately than publicly . " In an exchange with Congressman Charles E. Wiggins of California on November 15 , Ford said he had met with the President " roughly 15 times " since he was nominated on October 12 . He said that General Alexander Haig , the President 's staff chief , called him on " three or four " of these occasions and asked him to see the President . On several occasions , he continued , " I called General Haig and asked to see the President . " On several other occasions " I and others had met with the President and I stayed longer than they , and on those occasions I had no intercession by anybody . " Wiggins said he hoped that Ford as Vice President would n't " feel it is necessary to clear your meetings with General Haig or with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the President , it seems to me , and face him directly and personally . " Ford replied : " I have found no problems whatsoever thus far in getting to see the President . As a matter of fact he has shown great interest in talking to me about matters which I appreciate because I think it is indicative that he wants whatever information or advice I can give and I can assure you that , if confirmed , I hope that that personal relationship . . . will be expanded . " Congressman Henry P. Smith III of New York reminded Ford that " the possibility is always there that you might be President of the United States " and asked him to describe his " background in foreign affairs . " Ford replied : " I think being a member of the US Congress for 25 years , in the House , one does acquire considerable background in the field of foreign affairs . " He said his membership on three Appropriations subcommittees dealing with defense , foreign aid and CIA matters " was extremely helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia , in other parts of the world . " These memberships ended when he became minority leader in 1965 . He recalled his attendance at Interparliamentary Union meetings in Warsaw , Belgrade and Brussels . Also : " I have been privileged to attend a number of meetings at the White House under various Presidents where matters involving foreign policy were discussed and programs were executed or implemented sic . " And ? a point he made whenever his shortage of foreign policy experience came up ? a 12-day visit to mainland China last year gave him and the late Hale Boggs of Louisiana " a unique opportunity to travel the length and breadth of China and to meet extensively with top leIders of the People 's Republic of China . " All of this , he thought , gave him " a background that is at least equal to my predecessors in the office of Vice President . " When he was asked , " If the mantle of the presidency fell upon you , would it be your intention to keep Dr. Kissinger as Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superb Secretary of State . " Jacob Javits of New York , a Republican senator with maverick tendencies , said on December 5 that the pressures upon President Nixon to resign were certain to increase once a Republican Vice President and available successor was again in office . This factor , the prospect of a prolonged pre-impeachment inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee , and the visible fact that Mr. Nixon is n't looking well in some of his public appearances , justify a suggestion that citizens acquaint themselves with sections 3 and 4 of the 25th Atnendment to the Constitution . Sections 1 and 2 provide that the Vice President shall succeed the President in event of removal , death or resignation , and that a vacancy in the vice presidency shall be filled in the way the vacancy left by Spiro Agnew was filled . Sections 3 and 4 deal with what happens when a President reports himself or is found to be " unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . In that event , " such powers and duties shall be discharged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
