txt President . Ford was fully justified in his press conference last night to express his concern at the querulous and uncharitable reaction of too many Americans to the plight of the Vietnamese refugees . His statement on the desirability of admitting them to the United States ought to be read by every American . Mr. Ford 's request for $507 million to assist the resettlement of : approximately 130,000 Vietnamese over the next two years is a reasonable and honorable response to a tragic human situation . The United States can do nothing less . Those citizens who are unemployed or who are financially pinched by inflation and high taxes have sunderstandable fears that the nation is taking on yet another ' burden while their problems remain unsolved . But those fears are based on a misconception of the facts . About 60 per cent of the refugees are children , while many others are elderly persons too old to enter the job market . Thus , only 30,000 of the Vietnamese refugees , are heads of- households and likely to seek work . Of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find places for themselves in American life and contribute needed skills . What is harder than the fears of the unemployed to explain and justify is the antagonism of many members of Congress , including well-known liberals , and other leaders of opinion throughout the country . Several liberal members of the House of Representatives seem not to be aware that the war in Vietnam is over . No nation is eager to welcome criminals , prostitutes , war profiteers , or practitioners of political torture . But it grossly distorts the whole nature of the refugee problem to focus on the tiny minority of persons who might deserve one or another of those terms of opprobrium , or to exaggerate their number . There is no possible way to make a just determination about the political or moral character of individual refugees . If some Vietnamese engaged in dirty work , they usually had American advisers or were financed by American money . In some respects it was a dirty war . But now that it has all ended badly , it would be the ultimate disgrace for Americans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese who aligned themselves with the American war effort in their country . It is likewise blatantly contradictory to play upon fears that the Vietnamese may take away jobs or end up on . Atel fare rolls , and at the same time argue that many of them are too rich to deserve help . Most of these refugees have lost all of their worldly possessions . Many are separated from loved ones . All have lost their country , a lasting sorrow that perhaps only other migrants and exiles can fully comprehend . They deserve to be cherished as fellow human beings and given a welcoming hand as new Americans . George Meany , president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , has pledged the labor movement 's help  --  even in this time of economic adversity  --  to assist the Vietnamese refugees to find jobs . " The United States has an inescapable moral responsibility , " Mr. Meany observed . " We are a nation of immigrants . Rejecting them would be denying our heritage and the history of this country as a haven for the oppressed . " No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vietnam war , those words express the true American tradition .
