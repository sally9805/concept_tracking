THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AMONTH or so ago , three men were indicted on numerous counts for terrorizing East Side restaurants whose owners would not submit to their extortion demands . According to the Times ' account , the extortionists had repeated ) invaded the resisting restaurants during the dinner hour , shooting off guns , breaking windows , and throwing glasses , plates , and , in at least one instance , a bottle filled with gasoline . The police had no knowledge of these events for over a year , because the owners were afraid to complain and the customers simply did n't ; when things got messy , they moved on to eat elsewhere . lArhat comes to mind is news films of the periodic thinning of the buffalo herds .

MHE last significant snowfall here in the city ( as this is writ-ten ) came on March 14 , 1972 . While we try to think of some way to blame this ab-sence of snow on May-or Lindsay , we present part of a recent letter from a friend in St. Paul , who begins to sound more and more like a foreign corre-spondent : " I have also built a fine sled run in our hack yard , with an S-curve and steep hanks to contain all that speed . It is fast , and , though short ( about seventy-five feet ) , provides two moderate th rills , and , if ) ou go over the bank hy the garbage cans , a third .

I feel that if he 'd written up the toboggan run instead  --  or , better yet , had one in his hack yard  --  he 'd have been a lot better for it . " Amid the Raffia THE nineteenth Winter Antiques Show  --  a modern version of the medieval guild fair  --  opened at the 7th Regiment Armory last week , with fifty-nine major exhibitors operating from individual booths , plus a supporting cast of thirty dealers , whose wares were grouped together in a dazzling historical jumble just inside the main entrance . The show , an annual invitation-only affair for dealers , is one of the oldest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of what they own , to impress their colleagues as well as potential buyers . Collectors , museum officials , and interior decorators roam the aisles searching for " important " objects of beauty and character . Quality is so high that bargains are nonexistent , and the authenticity of the antiques on sale is virtually guaranteed . We dropped by the Armory a couple of days before the show opened , and found the vast , block-long hall in a state of controlled confusion . Painters and clectriciatis were putting the finishing touches on sturdy plywood booths as men and women dressed in casual clothes pulled Chippendale and Hepplewhite from wooden cases or extracted paper-thin Chinese porcelain from enormous wicker baskets . Uniformed security guards patrolled the aisles ( the entire exhibit is worth about ten million dollars ) , picking their way through mounds of crumpled newspapers and heaps of discarded raffia . As several grandfather clocks chimed seven o'clock simultaneously , it occurred to us that it was the kind of scene that Pieter Brueghel would have liked to paint . A guard directed us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John FitzGibbons , the chair " When Howard and George start letting their hair grow , I think we can safely assume that long hair is on its way out . " ? man of the show , and Russell Carrell , an antiques dealer , who acts as its general manager . " We have more applications for space than we can possibly handle , " said Mr. FitzGibbons , a gregarious , brown-haired young man , who is an interior decorator by profession . " A committee decides who is invited . And disinvited . We have dropped people in the past for a variety of reasons . One was a woman whose booth was an unorganized mess for two years in succession . Her things were authentic , but the over-all effect was disturbing . Another case involved a dealer who misrepresented a piece of furniture sold on the floor . " " How can you be sure everything is authentic ? " we asked . " We ca n't , " Mr. FitzGibbons said . " But reputations are so important in this business that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Russell and I see anything that does n't look right , we go over and glare at it , turn it upside down , and examine it very carefully . 1 , V-hen a dealer sees us doing that , of it goes . " " What is an antique ? " we asked . " Customs says it 's anything over a hundred years old , " replied Mr. Carrell , " but I prefer to think in terms of objects made before 1850 , when mass production by machines started . The exceptions to this rule would be American folk art and pressed glass . Now , if you 'd like to look at some of the booths , why do n't we start with the most -- oh  --  varied exhibit on the floor ? " We followed Mr. Carrell through the . hall to Booth 205 , where Nigel Morrison , a suave , gray-haired Englishman , was dusting a six-foot mummy Case . " When Nigel asked fur black walls and ceilings , I worried , " said Mr. Carrell . " But with the overhead spotlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm eclectic by nature , I think you can mix fine things of Al periods provided you have reasonable taste , " Mr. Morrison said . " The mummy case is 400 B.C. ? it was made for a noblewoman of Thebes  --  and it came our of Egypt last year with authentication from the Cairo museum . I 've put it between two eighteenthcentury Chippendale mirrors and behind two very good Louis XV chairs with tapestry covers . Of course , 400 B.C. is rather late for Egypt ; these two small statues are at least a thousand years older . The alabaster servant is Twelfth Dynasty , and the wooden one , of the god Ptah , was made about 1500 B.C. " We walked slowly past John and Leah Gordon 's assemblage of American rai ities ( primitive portraits , galloping-horse weather vanes , Indian pottery , carving , and headwork ) and paused before a sumptuous collection of Chinese porcelain that belonged to the Chait Galleries . " We specialize in Chinese art , " explained Allan Chait , conducting us over to a delicate statuette of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ch'ien-lung , or mid-eighteenthcentury , and it was made in China for Chinese taste . It costs thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars , which is reasonable , considering the quality . By far the larger category of porcelain that you see today is Export Porcelain , which consists of plates , bowls , and vases that were made in China for Europeans , veil often using designs that were sent out to Asia to he copied . " He showed us an early-eighteenth-century , soup tureen and platter in famillr VCTle that lead been made for the French market , and told this that it cost twenty-two thousand dollars . " The best way to buy Chinese porcelain is aesthetically , " he added . " But it 's also a good investment , because the supply is progressively limited . These days , the best collections go into museums . " Nearby , we found Elinor Gordon , a Chinese Export specialist , who maintains a shop near Philadelphia . " My , rarest piece 15 a I791 tea howl and saucer that are decorated with a figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of New York , and the state motto , ' Excelsior , ' " she said . " And bear in mind that this was made in China . " She showed us a fiftyeight-piece dinner service in white , blue , and gold , and a couple of ormolu-mounted figurines dating from the eighteenth century . " Supply is not 111 ) problem , because I 'm buying back a lot of pieces I sold years ago , " she continued . " People are giving up large homes or are finding the insurance problem impossible to solve . But there 's always a market . " Switching our attention to furniture , we walked over to Booth 107 , where Fred Nadler , a knowledgeable young man from Bay Head , showed us a rediacqu e red eighteenth-century secretary and it gigantic Coromandel screen . " The secretary is a William and Mary-Queen Anne transitional piece , " Mr. Nadler said . " it was made in England and shipped to China , where it was lacquered .

" I was attracted by the subtle colors , the condition , and the painting , " he said . " We guarantee that the screen is Ch'ien-lung , but it might he K'anghsi , or very e a - eighteenth-centmy . The paintings show some kind of court celebration on the front anti a series of landscapes and birds on the reverse . The price is thirty-five thousand dollars , hut , if you wanted to sit with it awhile , it will eventually , in my opinion , filing fifty to sixty thousand . " OntOlOgy RCHARD FOREMAN is not even slightly bemused by success . For the last four years , Mr. Foreman 's plays have been witnessed by select audiences in Mr. Foreman 's select Ontological-Hysteric Theatre , which is very . far Off Broadway , at SO Wooster Street , and practically no one who failed to see the plays was aware of their existence . Then , last November . another Foreman play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music by Stanley Silverman , opened at the Mercer Arts Center and quickly established itself as the hit of the current Off Broadway season . " Docuit Selavy " is a fast-moving , cheerfully nonsensical show , performed with great style by a poop of exceptionally talented young women and young men , and on the evening we saw it the house was sold out and the audience struck us as looking agreeably confused . Two nights later , we went to see " Sophia = ( Wisdom ) Part 3 : The Cliffs , " the current Foreman production at the Ontological-Hysteric , which is neither musical not cheerful , and whose audience could he described as dedicated . Since then , we have been to see Mr. Foreman himself , and we can report that he is in no doubt whatsoever concerning trite Muse . " Selavy ' is a kind of an offshoot , " Mr. Foreman told us over a cup of coffee in his apartment , a spacious loft on Wooster Street , two blocks north of the theatre . " Stanley Silverman and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last SUrtirneT mainly because we wanted an excuse to get out of New York . Some dose friends of mine came up there to see the show , and afterward they said , Richard , you must not let that he done in New York under your name . People will think You 've sold out . ' But I do n't disown it . Obviously , it 's less esoteric than my other work  --  although the amazing thing to me now is that a lot of people seem to think ' Doctor Selavy ' is very strange . Actually I like theatre that 's either loWdoik and raucous or austere and difficult . What I do n't like is middle-class serious drama . " A small gray kitten began clanlherbig our right leg . Mr. Foreman , a composed young man with longish dark hair and a droopy mustache , told us that he was horn on Staten Island but brought up in Scarsdale . The operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan , performed by the D'Oyly Carte company when it visited New York , turned him on to theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays as an undergraduate at Brown University . They were " Clifford ( Mils stuff and also some Yeatsian experimental plays , " he told us , but he said that by the time he left , to get his graduate degree at the Yale School of Drama , he was " completely and totally " under the influence of Brecht . " Is the cat bothering you ? " he asked , noting that the kitten was sitting on our head . We said no . Mr. Foreman removed it anyway , and went on to say that Brecht continued to be the main influence on him until about 1964 , when , as a struggling Young playwright living in Manhattan , he started going to underground films and saw Jack Smith 's film " Flaming Creatures . " " ' Flaming Creatures ' was a revelation to me , " Mr. Foreman said . " It and some of those other films allowed me to feel that I did n't have to be embarrassed by the roughness in my own work . Most of my work up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the language that sounded rough or corny or unsophisticated to my ears . What those movies did for me , primarily , was to make me realize that you could accept all that and show it for what it is . " Although Foreman was tempted to make films , he stuck to play writing , but he let go of Brecht . " I remember very specifically asking myself , one day , what I would really like to see in the theatre , " he said . " And into my head flashed  --  it 's almost embarrassing to say this  --  a moment from a scene in Genet 's ' The Balcony , ' which I had seen when it was being done at the Circle in the Square . It was a moment when there were Just two acJANUARY 2 7 , 1 9 7 3 tresses onstage , standing and looking at each other . I had this feeling of wanting to stop the action right there and take time to explore the presrnce of those people on that stage , to exploit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then , my plays have had a sort of tableau , static quality , interrupted by accidents and things falling apart . " We recalled several intense moments of this kind in " Sophia= ( Wisdom ) , " between a young actress clothed in black ( Sophia ) and a young actress clothed in nothing at all , and between other members of the cast of twelve . We also recalled that , although none of these performers had actually spoken lines , there was a good deal of dialogue , both audible ( by means of a tape recording ) and legible ( on a screen , by means of a slide projector ) . Foreman told us that he had started using . the tape recorder in order to get rid of the personality of the actor . " ' What really bothered me most about the theatre , and still does , is the inflection of the language as it 's spoken in America , " he said . " I 'm basically interested in staging what 's going on in my head while I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start talking normally it just does n't sound like that . " His solution in " Sophia= ( Wisdom ) " was to tape-record the dialogue and play it back while his actors ( who arc mostly nonprofessionals ) moved through the complex and striking patterns he devised for them . Since 1968 , Foreman has staged four of his plays at the Cinematheque , which is to say that he has designed the sets and the lighting , built the props ( with some help from friends ) , and directed the performances , which arc meticulously worked out , with no improvisation of any kind . In addition , he has staged another of his plays at the Theatre for the New City , on Bank Street , and he is responsible for the staging and design of " Doctor Selavy 's Magic Theatre " at the Mercer Arts Center . The success of " Doctor Selavy " has nut brought him any seductive commercial offers as yet , but he would almost certainly refuse them if it did , Grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support his more austere and difficult activities at the Ontological-Hysteric . He is planning to put on a new work this spring at the Theatre for the New City , and he has been invited to Paris in July to stage one of his plays for the Festival de l'Automne , using French actors . Being a compulsive writer , he has a great many unproduced scripts THE NEW YORKER lying around . The one he plans to do in Paris is called " Classical Therapy . " " I think my work is less aggressively private than it was four years ago , " he told us . " MY early stuff was influenced by all those wild people in the . film underground , with their Rimbitudian themes ; then- was much more hostility expressed  --  a lot of loud buzzers going off and lights in the audience 's eyes , and things like that  --  and I guess I sort of enjoyed seeing people walk out . Now the plays are definitely mellower . I think they 're getting more and more Chinese . Most theatre is built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manipulate the audience 's response . I 'm certainly not trying to do that . . Reaily , I 'm just trying to make an object that I 'll end up loving . " Official fl WHY do we have a govern-N .. ? .1 ? merit , anyway ? Does it serve am useful purpose ? A. Well , to answer your second question first  --  and we 're assuming that you 're asking only about the federal government  --  the answer is certainly , definitely , yes . The government publishes some of the most beautiful and informative hooks published anywhere . For instance , the books of photographs of the earth and the moon , prepared by NASA , and the new atlas of China , turned out by the C.I.A . The government also makes things official . This is one of the functions of the United States Board on Geographic Names , a service of the United States Department of the Interior . The Board makes place names official . It explains in the foreword to a recent publication , " Decisions on Geographic Names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Decision List No. 7201 , " " It is the Board 's responsibility ) to render formal decisions on new names , proposed changes in names , and names which are in conflict . " Tht Board 's names are used on all federal maps and in all federal documents . The Board is composed of a member and a deputy apiece from the Departments of State , the . Army , the Navy , the Interior , Agriculture , Commerce , the Air Force , and Defense , the Government Printing Office , and the Library of Congress . The names of all these people appear on the back of the title page of " Decisions . " There are spaces for names of a member and a deputy from the Postal Service and the C.I.A. , but these spaces are blank . The Postal Service may have dropped mit , but the C.I.A . is probably just not letting on . The first name in " Decisions " is Bee Branch , a stream in Alabama . Here 's the entire listing : Bee Branch : stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N , 87 ' 06 ' 16 " W. flows S to Blevens Creek 6 mi .

Variant : 13 Branch . Now , " variant , " according to the foreword , refers to " unapproved variant names , spellings , or applications ... which ma ) include former names or spellings no longer used , names derived by the application of policies other than those approved by the Board , misspellings , and names misapplied to all or part of the subject feature .
