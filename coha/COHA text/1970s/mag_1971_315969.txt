The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights ended its hearings into the extent of Government surveillance of citizens last week . The hearings produced no clear-cut plans for remedial legislation . They did , however , accomplish the aim of the subcommittee 's chairman , North Carolina Senator Sam J.
