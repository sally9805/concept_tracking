A NEW INSTALLMENT HAS OPENED in America 's long-running serial , " The Perils of the Corporation , " or " Hassling the Fat Cats . " The corporation , as fans scarcely need be reminded , has been trust-busted and regulated ; divested and diversified ; struck and picketed ; boycotted , bombed , and reviled ; theorized out of existence in the classroom , and convicted in the courts since it captured the public imagination a century or so ago . From each new episode it has emerged hale , hearty , and as exploitatively inclined as ever . The latest assault comes on flying the banner of Corporate Responsibility , a slogan that takes in all of the day 's great issues ? the war in Vietnam , racism , and , yes , ecology . Among the attacking troopers we can spot that grand old guerrilla organizer Saul Alinsky , who wore down Eastman Kodak into hiring more unskilled blacks and is now picking on Commonwealth Edison of Chicago ; former Congressman and U.S. Plywood heir Richard Ottinger , at the controls of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Telephone Company ; and a twenty-nine-yearold operative named Rodney Shields , who has purchased a single share of stock in three dozen largefirms and , from these privileged sanctuaries , has been firing off socially minded proposals at their boards . Hovering benignly over all is the patron saint of the movement , Ralph Nader . Among the companies that have lately felt the protestors ' sting are A &P; ( charged with a habit of discriminating in hiring and merchandising ) ; Honeywell ( maker of fragmentation bombs ; Polaroid ( which sells cameras and film to South Africans ) ; Gulf Oil ( which has extensive operations in Portuguese Angola ) ; the Bank of America ( which has the misfortune to be centered in California ) ; and . most conspicuously , General Motors ( whose sins are too numerous to be recounted in a parenthesis ) . Wherein does the present campaign differ from past campaigns ? For one thing , it has gone beyond such traditional targets as shoddy or unsafe products and mistreatment of workers to settle on the corporations ' less pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken to prodding the consciences of investors , particularly those who handle large amounts of other people 's money . The new reformers are out to persuade money managers for churches , universities , foundations , and pension funds : investment advisers and mutual fund directors insurance executives and bankers ( bankers ? ) that virtue and profit compel them to the paths of righteousness . The outsiders are attempting to work not merely within the system but at the very heart of it , from whence the fuel is pumped that feeds all the organs and limbs of commerce . Heading up the intelligence arm of the assault forces is a bright and engaging young woman named Mice Tepper . At the age of twenty-seven , modishly dressed Miss Tepper is founder and director of the Council on Economic Priorities ( CEP ) , whose mission is the collection of facts about suspect industries ( facts that vice presidents for public relations are loath to part with ) and their dissemination to interested persons to be used as honor dictates and power permits . Despite a title that brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury which come with trumpets , go in disarray , and leave no mark behind , this Council is on the side of the angels , not the Establishment , On graduating from Wellesley in the mid-Sixties , with a major in economics , Miss Tepper spent a season on the beaches of Greece before returning to New York to look for a job where she might learn " how business really worked " ? her long-run intention being " to go create black capitalism . " Simulating a craving to be a securities analyst , she joined a Wall Street investment firm , managed to get registered as a broker , and left after eighteen months , only to find that black capitalism had more ready advisers than prospective entrepreneurs . So she went to work instead for the McCarthy campaign , then moved to Cambridge and found a place with Thomas O'Connell , money managers , where her destiny would find her . A trustee of a large Boston synagogue , a friend of O'Connell 's came to the firm with the request that it put together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous military-industrial complex . Miss Tepper found the assignment to her liking , but ran into problems in trying to carry it out . flow , for example , was one to define " military-industrial complex " ? Hundreds of firms produce a good or a service that the military buys for some ostensible use . Are they all part of the dread complex ? no matter how innocent their contribution or how insignificant a portion it represents of their total business ? And , anyway , where was one to go for information ? With time , patience , and sufficient staff , one could immerse oneself in government documents and eventually put together a list of who was selling what to whom . But that was beyond the resources of the O'Connell firm , and there was no direct way to look up , say , the amount of business the Bulova Watch Company did with military agencies . This set Miss Tepper to musing over how much easier the job would be if she had a sort of Standard &; P oor 's or Moody 's to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her musings were sharpened when O'Connell placed an advertisement in the Sunday New York Times , offering a " peace-oriented portfolio " to persons who wished to invest 510.000 or more in companies that did not depend on defense contracts . The ad , " a tiny one , " drew 600 responses . Evidently there were investors out there who were worried about the uses to which their money was being put . " I began thinking ... this could be a powerful way of affecting corporate decision-making . " From such thoughts , and with the advice of acquaintances and $30,000 from a donor who prefers to remain anonymous , came the Council on Economic Priorities . SING A COMBINATION of volunteers and nom-1- inallyy paid staff and operating out of donated office space in New York and Washington ( " Roger Sonnabend Hotel Corporation of America said , What can I do to help ? ' and gave us a suite at the Mayflower . Unfortunately , the Plaza was fully booked " ) , since early 1970 , CEP has been publishing a bimonthly Economic Priorities Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 for individuals . " Chase Manhattan Bank , AFL-CIO , National Council of Churches , and Ralph Nader all read Economic Priorities Report ... the social balance sheet on American corporations . " Its subjects so far have included : ? A listing of 105 companies that produce antipersonnel weapons , published by Harper &; Row under the title Efficiency in Death . Asked how that title meets her professed aim of objectivity , Miss Tepper explains that the report was originally called Manufacturers of Anti-Personnel Weapons , but the publisher thought it needed " a sexier title . " Dissident shareholders in Honeywell , listed as having $250 million worth of contracts for anti-personnel weapons , used the report against management at noisy annual meetings in 1970 and 1971 . Miss Tepper says that one mutual fund , unnamed , sold its Honeywell stock as a result of the study , and middle executives at the company are still mulling the implications of it all . ? Oil Overview , a report on the petroleum industry 's messy record regarding spillage , auto pollution , the Alaska pipeline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too weakly researched and too ambitious for CEP 's resources . ? A better researched report , with which she is quite pleased ? Paper Profits : Pollution in the Pulp and Paper Industry . It roused a partisan of the industry to call CEP " a hunch of girls running around in miniskirts playing God . " Two firms , Owens-Illinois , Inc. , and Weyerhaeuser Company , were given good marks for anti-pollution efforts . St. Regis , Potlatch , and Diamond International were at the bottom of the list . In anticipation of the report , Potlatch ran an ad ? a picture of a refreshing country scene full of clear blue water , over this line : " It cost us a bundle , but the Clearwater River no longer trouble reformers very much ; the ideologue who gags at Greece can swallow Czechoslovakia . But the argument insists on popping up . Miss Tepper , no ideologue ( she does n't know what to do about Greece because the military regime seems to be helping the farmers ) , concedes that it might be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and points out that CEP reports on South Africa have dealt not with trade but with U.S. firms that actually run factories there . ( On the other hand , it is not enough for the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement PRWM that Polaroid , a company with a reputation for social enlightenment , cease selling cameras for South Africa 's official identification system ; PRWM demands that the firm disengage completely from doing business in the country and turn over its profits from South Africa to South African liberation movements . ) To complicate the matter further , two economists recently pointed out in the Harvard Business Review that it is uncertain that anyone could put together an investment portfolio that was not " contaminated in some way by relationships with South Africa . " They proceeded to suggest that if the moral , political , and social effects of an investment are brought in as criteria , " a case could be made for avoiding investment in virtually any company . " W HATEVER ONE 'S FEELINGS about apartheid , maintain the advocates of corporate conscience ( though they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ) , the question of investing in a country that practices it should not be decided on in corporate boardrooms , at least as now inhabited . America 's corporations , they point out , much as Berle and Means pointed out some decades ago and J. K. Galbraith has been doing in his witty fashion ever since , are vastly powerful ; their decisions impinge upon all of our lives in a multitude of ways ; yet the nation has little direct say in these decisions . The focus of discontent for the past few years has been General Motors , the biggest corporation of them all . The attack is being directed by a group of young lawyers who call themselves the Project for Corporate Responsibility . Their effort goes back to the fall of 1969 when they entertained the idea of putting up a well-known candidate for a seat on the board of a well-known company . As Philip Moore , twenty-eight years old , out of Harvard and the University of Chicago Law School , tells the story : " It was to be a symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ought to have . " They considered nominating Wayne Morse to the board of Dow Chemical , John Kenneth Galbraith to AT &T,; and Ralph Nader to General Motors . Morse and Galbraith proving otherwise occupied , they settled on Campaign GM . As it turned out , Nader 's lawyers advised him notto muddy his suit against GM by running for the board ; he withdrew his name , though not his support , Having purchased twelve of GM 's 285,000,000 shares of common stock , the campaigners succeeded in getting two proposals onto the proxy ballot sent out by management in preparation for the 1970 annual meeting . Campaign GM proposed that GM 's board be expanded from twenty-three to twenty-six members , the added three to be " representatives of the public " ? namely , Rene J. Dubos , the Rockefeller University biologist ; Channing Phillips , black Democratic National Committeeman from Washington , D.C. ; and Betty Furness , consumer affairs adviser to President Johnson : and that a shareholders ' committee be delegated to keep an eye on the company 's social accounting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , whose retreat . ing hairline and expanding moustache would enable him to pass readily as one of the over-thirty generation . " It 's silly to send out unsafe products , then contribute a million dollars to a safety group . " Management responded in management 's manner . In the opinion of GM 's Chairman James Roche , such proposals represent a challenge to " the entire system of corporate management in the United States . " A booklet celebrating GM 's achievements in the public behalf was sent out to stockholders . Institutional investors , who control sizable amounts of stock , were urged to stand with management . Moore describes the GM management as " insular and paranoid ... You mention Ralph Nader and they explode . If they 'd been smart , they would 've adopted some form of our proposals and we 'd have been dead . " To no one 's surprise , management won ; neither of Campaign GM 's propositions received 3 per cent of the vote at the unusually lively annual meeting . A number of institutional investors , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Rockefeller Foundation gave their vote to Mr. Roche with the warning that they expected him to be courageous , wise , compassionate , and enlightened thereafter . Someday soon , they hinted , they might put their money where their convictions were . That Chairman Roche and his colleagues were impressed with the response to Campaign GM became clear some months after the annual meeting when Dr. Leon Sullivan , a prominent black activist from Philadelphia , was appointed to the board , and a Public Policy Committee of five board members was set up to keep an eye on things like pollution , racial discrimination , and unjust wars . " A fabulous success , " says Moore of his 1970 campaign . " It shook ' em up . " Last spring . Campaign GM , Round II , waded into the issue of " shareholder democracy . " Moore thinks of the assault as " part of an enabling process to give voice to Cesar Chavez , George Wiley , Betty Friedan , Jesse Jackson .... " He and his friends , bent on maintaining " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management in future include the names of board candidates nominated by ordinary stockholder and are subject to the pres- of liberal and radical forces on campus and in the ministry . However , churches and universities have their special functions , which their investments are designed to support and enhance . Might not the portfolio manager who uses his powers for some broad social good rather than for profit be impeding the ability of his school or church to carry forward its inimitable works by depriving it of needed funds ? To this question , the socially conscious money manager may reply with the hopeful proposition that " in the long run ' ' firms that behave in a responsible manner do better than firms that ignore their social responsibilities . David W. Burke , spokesman for the Dreyfus Third Century Fund , points out that companies such as IBM , Polaroid , Xerox , and Johnson &; Johnson have been profitable as vv ell as virtuous . His prospectus is careful to note : " The Fund does not intend to invest in or hold securities of companies merely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deemed suitable for long-range capital appreciation . " If , indeed , profit and virtue can be made to go hand in hand , even if only in the long run , that settles the matter . Every investor can have the satisfaction of growing rich with an easy conscience . ( Over the short term , he can take his satisfaction by casting his votes for Campaign GM with confidence that he will lose . ) Still , for the sake of argument , what if it should somehow happen that virtuous actions are not rewarded in this life ? " I do n't notice that DuPont stock has tripled since they announced they 're going to spend $300 million against pollution , " remarks a veteran fund manager . Having lately , and belatedly , doubled its anti-pollution budget , the St. Regis Paper Company experienced a 51 per cent decline in profits in the first quarter of this year . Or what if companies that behave in unvirtuous ways make money ? " What has been the cost to corporations of discriminating against blacks ? " asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nation is paying for it all right , but was discrimination really all that unprofitable all those years to companies that relied on a supply of low-paid workers to do disagreeable jobs ? A rough study at Princeton University , where students protested against the school 's investments in South Africa , indicates that those objectionable stocks had almost a 3 per cent higher average rate of return than other securities in its portfolio . ( Incidentally , it would cost Princeton an estimated $5 million in brokerage fees to get out of South Africa altogether . ) In its 1971 proxy statement to General Motors , the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Protestant Episcopal Church urged that GM wind up its $125 million of manufacturing activities in South Africa because apartheid " will inevitably lead to turmoil and instability . and consequently to the destruction of foreign capital invested there . " However , the church went on , GM should get out of South Africa even if it entailed a loss because " only those corporations which conduct themselves in a socially responsible way will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " The Will to Believe survives among Episcopalians . At least it did before GM 's annual meeting , where their proposal won 1.29 per cent of the shares voted . And what of the managers of trust funds and pension funds ? Should they be permitted to risk my money in behalf of their principles ? The laws governing fiduciary relationships do not encourage experimentation , even for reasons of conscience . The Wall Street rule for persons legally charged with the management of other people 's money runs as follows : " Invest funds in a company with the aim of gaining the best financial return with the least financial risk for the trust beneficiaries . If you later come to disagree with the company 's management , sell the stock . " This rule , we may assume , is used by many trustees to go along mindlessly with management and avoid the wear and tear of decision-making . Nevertheless , there remains a real legal question . David Silver , general counsel of Investment Company Institutes , a trade group , observes , " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good investment because it does n't like its hiring policies in South Africa , there could be a shareholders ' suit . " But even if there were no legal problem , might there not be a moral problem for the prudent trustee ? Peter L. Bernstein , chairman of the board of Bernstein-Macauley and chairman of the investment policy committee of CBWL-Hayden . Stone , confesses that he feels some inner pressure to invest the funds in his charge in mortgages in minority areas , with the prospect of a lower return than they might bring elsewhere . But if he should succumb to that small voice , he observes , it will not be he who pays the price , but his clients : " Sorry , fellas , you 've been elected to bear the cost . " Why should this particular group suffer this special tax ? Moreover , Bernstein points out that in a market economy , if capital flows not toward profits but toward social priorities . " we lose a rational measure of how to allocate capital . " That , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awakens in him stirrings of sympathy for radicals who would scrap the whole thing . Not all investment advisers are as diffident as Mr. Bernstein . " We 're making moral judgments all the time , " Donald Weeden , chairman of Weeden &; Company , told the Institutional Investor . " As individuals , we have been picked for our overall sensitivity to what 's been going on . " Now , no offense to Mr. Weeden , but I do n't know any investment adviser whom I would care to have act in my behalf in any matter except turning a profit ? and I 'm not sure about that . The value of these specialists , I believe , lies in their limitations ; they ought not allow themselves to see so much of the world that they become distracted . Perhaps , though , fund managers might poll their investors and let them make their own decisions when confronted by a conflict between profit and principle . Under a recent SEC decision , shareholders can vote on whether fund managers should consider the social policies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest GM go-around , in May , the Dreyfus Leverage Fund , holder of 25,000 shares of GM stock , solicited the opinions of shareholders on several of the insurgent proposals . In every case , most people voted with GM management and against the insurgents , whereupon Dreyfus voted its proxy in favor of the proposal requiring GM to publish detailed information on pollution and so forth . " We had to vote for that proposal , " explains a fund spokesman . " because we believe in it . " Mutual fund democracy ? Aside from the practical aspects of holding a vote every time such questions arise , the prospect of allowing a cabal of investors to determine the social uses for their cash ( along with the cash of investors who may not agree with them about war or minorities ) promises no great improvement over what now exists . We have heard from the constituents of Dreyfus . What would be the reaction of a group of plumbers who are asked to sacrifice a bit of their pension fund in order that some money may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring ? At Consolidated Edison 's annual meeting in May , executives came
