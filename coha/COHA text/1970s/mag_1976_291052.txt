James David Barber is getting a bit weary of people coming up to him and telling him their mothers-in-law are " active-negative " types . But the burden is borne genially by this Duke University political science professor who devised his special psychological measurement for Presidents , not for mothers-in-law . <P> From detailed study , Barber rates the energy a President puts into his job as either " active " or " passive , " and he catalogues how a President feels about what he does as either " positive " or " negative . " The combination of these elements of energy and attitude places the man in one of four categories ranging from passive-negative to active-positive , with active-negative producing the greatest potential for tragedy , active-positive the best hope for progress . Already some observers have rated Ford passive-positive and Carter a near active-negative who by the grace of God slipped into the active-positive category . <P> Any popularized academic theory of this kind inevitably gets distorted , and Barber 's certainly will this week as the most massive character analysis in all history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guideposts that Barber established in his psychological assessment will also give more stability and meaning to this national exercise than we have had in the past . Barber 's book , The Presidential Character , codifies and explains the importance of presidential character in national leadership . Character is only one of five elements Barber cites ( the others : world view , style , power situation , climate of expectations ) . But character is the crucial one , the compass setting for an Administration , often the element that tips the balance between success and failure . <P> With the differences between Ford 's and Carter 's programs narrowing and with the world relatively tranquil , the big issue before the American house is simply what kind of men these two are-character . In 1960 Barber watched the powerful fusion of John Kennedy and television and decided political psychology was one way to get a glimpse of how Presidents might perform in the future . <P> ? <P> Carter has studied Barber 's theories and pronounced them among the most important he has read ; Ford 's researchers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in dozens of major universities . He gets calls from broadcasters , reporters , politicians and even mothers-in-law who seek his expert assessments . Barber is deep into an academic study of this election and its participants , and he is pledged to restraint until it is over . Sometimes perched in an old-fashioned barbershop chair he has in his office , he turns away pleadings to rate the men by his scale . But he thinks every voter should do his own analysis . <P> " The real presidential task is not dashing from shopping center to shopping center making the same speech , " says Barber , explaining why it is healthy to view campaign rhetoric with skepticism . In those shopping centers , Lyndon Johnson promised to keep the U.S. out of the Viet Nam War and Nixon spouted all the American ideals that he systematically violated . A close look at their lives showed both men almost programmed by birth and background to do what they did .                   @ @
