Question : What would draw a crowd of 4,500 people-almost all housewives- to the opening of a Thom McAn men 's shoe store in Davenport , Iowa ? <P> Answer : Steak . <P> All 4,500 turned out on the promise that just one of them would win a supply of four beef filets weekly for a year . Similar scenes occurred at Thom McAn openings in Dallas , Roanoke , Va. , and South Bend , Ind . In St. Louis , three banks were attracting lines of new depositors by promising each of them a poke of rib eye . Juicy bovine slabs were joining Waring Blenders and Miami Beach vacations on America 's list of treasured giveaways . <P> The beef industry-farmers , ranchers , packers and especially cattle feed-lot operators-could not have hoped for better testimony to the point that it was trying to make . The Nixon Administration 's price freeze on beef , which is not scheduled to end until Sept. 12 , was shutting off the supply to the public . The price of live animals was not frozen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell at controlled prices . The number of cattle slaughtered at packing plants dropped 10% two weeks ago and plunged an estimated 23% last week . At least 40 plants shut down throughout the Middle West . There were reports of cattle rustling in Utah and a hijacked meat truck in Stamford , Conn . Canadian operators were buying cattle in the U.S. , dressing it in Canada and selling it back to the U.S. at prices above freeze levels because there is no freeze on imports . <P> Black Markets . For the U.S. consumer , who has an almost emotional attachment to beef , the meat situation was similar to that of World War II-but without the patriotic fervor . Black markets developed as some packers sold sides of beef for whatever price they could get ; the usual subterfuge was to sell lower-grade cuts at high-grade prices . Supermarkets adopted a form of rationing , occasionally limiting shoppers to a roast or two each . All across the country , shoppers discovered empty or nearly empty meat trays ; in Cleveland , a fight broke out between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home freezers heated up to records as many shoppers hoarded , risking disaster if the electricity went out . <P> In Washington the purveyor to the White House staff , Bernard Goldstein , protested the price freeze by refusing to supply President Nixon with his usual choice cuts , and directors of the Cattlemen 's Hall of Fame in New Braunfels , Texas , promptly elected Goldstein Man of the Month . Jails , hospitals and college cafeterias will have to cut down on servings of meat and stretch their meals with macaroni and plentiful , reasonably priced seasonal produce , including potatoes , snap beans , corn , squash , cucumbers , bananas , peaches , cantaloupes and nectarines . At least two U.S. institutions , however , vowed to pay any price or bear any burden in order to get great portions of red meat for their highly prized charges . One was the Cleveland Browns football team ; the other was Chicago 's Brookfield Zoo .
