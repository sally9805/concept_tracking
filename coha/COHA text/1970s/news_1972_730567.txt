txt Word is out in Washington that economics both tra , de and monetary affairs ? will dominate U.S. relations with the outside world in the next few Tears . President Nixon is determined to minitile down the whopping U.S. trade deficit ? more than $5 billion already this year ? and to forge a new world monetary system to steady a battered dollar . Determination is one thing . The ability to achieve these gOals is another , and Mr. Nixon has chosen Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz to manage the multisided negotiations now under way . It was Mr. Shultz who last September gave the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) bold U S. suggestions for a new world monetary system to replace the outmoded Bretton Woods rules Mr Shultz forecast a reduced future role for the dollar and gold , and their progressive replacement by " paper gold " ? special drawing rights ( SDR ) ? as the new " numeraire , " or base , or a reformed monetary system Shield against attack Such a change should shield the dollar from massive speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pile up in foreign treasuries , as financiers sold dollars for stronger currencies . Mr. Shultz also called for new rules requiring chronically surplus nations ? notably Japan and West Germany ? to bring their trade and currencies into better balance with the rest of the world . The U.S. aim is to create a monetary system with enough flexibility to prevent bargain-hungry money from rolling around the world like loose ballast on a ship , disrupting normal trade and currency flows . // *Nixon goals : dollar , trade stability // This must be accompanied , Washington says , by reduction of the barriers that the enlarged European Economic Community ( EEC ) and Japan , in particular , erect against foreign imports . The United States enjoys a trading surplus with the EEC , but fears this may slip away under current common market rules With Japan , the U.S. is deeply in the red . Negotiations initiated Not all the world agrees with this U.S. interpretation , and the toughest kind of negotiations are beginning ? within GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Shultz as a new kind of economic czar , with White House and Cabinet responsibilities , means that his guidance will span both sets of talks Mr. Shultz will head a new economic council , comprising the secretaries of commerce , labor , agriculture , transportation , and state , plus his own Treasury . Also on the council will be the chiefs of the Council of Economic Advisers , the Office of Management and Budget , the Council on International Economic Policy , and the Cost-ofLiving Council . President Nixon , in other words , seems determined to coordinate the multiform U.S. economic programs , both domestic and foreign , through a single council , chaired by Mr. Shultz . Presumably the State Department input will be stronger than before , for Mr Nixon has carved , out a new post ? Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs ? and filled it with William J. Casey , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . Tasks at home Mr Shultz and tt .... m will face tasks at home ei y mt as challenging as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made on the continuance of wage and price controls , whose congressional mandate expires next April 30 . The controls program , which Mr Nixon inaugurated Aug. 15 , 1971 , has helped to reduce inflation to about 3 percent yearly , and to boost annual U.S. economic growth to more than 7 percent The question is ? would abandonment of controls trigger a new round of inflation , especially since millions of American workers in key industries will be negotiating new wage contracts in 1973 ? Retention of controls , on the other hand , erodes basic liberties in the United States . Mr Shultz himself has expressed this view . In any case , final decision on the future of controls rests , not with the new economic czar , but with President Nixon . Unemployment remains unacceptably high at 5.5 percent of the nation 's work force The administration will be under heavy pressure from Congress and trade unions to lower this figure at least to 4 percant , the so-called " full employment " level . Spending cutback Also to be adjudicated by Mr Shultz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $250 billion in the 197$ fiscal year . The President says no new taxes will be needed , if government spending can be trimmed by $5 billion or $6 billion down to the **32;993;TOOLONG mark Congressional critics fear that social welfare , education , and ecological projects may suffer from cuts , rather than defense and other foreign-related programs . Looming over all these considerations is an approaching energy shortage of such proportions that it could throw all current calculations out of kilter , by forcing the U.S. to import billions of dollars worth of oil yearly .
