AS the head of Princeton 's physics department , Atomic Scientist Marvin ( " Murph " ) Goldberger , 56 , was so happy in his work that he turned away presidential-search committees from a number of universities . That was before he was asked to run the California Institute of Technology . Says Goldberger , who was formally inaugurated last week as the fourth president of 87-year-old Caltech : " As a scientist , I felt I had no choice but to take it . This is an incredible place . " <P> Goldberger is the most recent , but by no means the only scientist to succumb to the lure of the brainy powerhouse in Pasadena . In fact , Caltech was fashioned from a vocational school into an exclusive West Coast scientific preserve during the early 1900s by deep-thinking migrants from back East . Most notable among them : Chemist Arthur Noyes , a former acting president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who became the first academic vice president of Caltech ; University of Chicago Experimental Physicist Robert Millikan , whose prestige attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Ellery Hale , the school 's visionary godfather . Because of their academic specialties , the founding trio are irreverently known as " Stinker , Tinker and Thinker . " <P> Housed in a sleek campus of cantilevered concrete labs and trim glass high-rises , Caltech has achieved international influence far disproportionate to its size . The school has only 251 faculty members , 812 undergraduates and 851 graduate stu dents , making it roughly one-fifth the size of friendly rival M.I.T. Two-thirds of the incoming freshmen in an average Caltech class have scored a perfect 800 on advanced-mathematics college-entrance exams . Seventeen of its faculty and alumni have received Nobel prizes ; two weeks ago , Alumnus Robert Wilson , now a researcher at Bell Labs , joined this elite roster by sharing the Nobel for physics . <P> It was at Caltech that Astronomer Maarten Schmidt discovered the nature of quasars , perhaps the most distant objects in the universe , that Theoretical Physicist Murray Gell-Mann described the way in which more than 100 subatomic particles are related , and that Physicist Carl D. Anderson discovered the positron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive charge . The first successful U.S. orbiting satellite , Explorer I , was launched by the school 's acclaimed Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which developed the principles that make jet flight possible . <P> Caltech alumni give much credit for their school 's achievements to its small size , which allows scientists in different disciplines to know each other well . Frequently , interdisciplinary research projects are first sketched over lunch at the Athenaeum , an elegant faculty club with a high-beamed Spanish-style ceiling at the campus ' east end . Academically , the school deliberately remains narrower than , say , M.I.T. , which is noted for such nonscientific departments as linguistics and economics . At Caltech the focus is on engineering and basic research in the " hard " sciences , especially physics , astronomy , biology , chemistry and seismology . Nuts-and-bolts technology gets little attention . " We really ought to call ourselves the California Institute of Science , " argues Chemistry Professor Harry Gray .                    @
