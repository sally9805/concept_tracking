txt Wendy Hamburger no longer makes Wendy 's Old-Fashioned Hamburgers . After working three months at a Wendy 's fast-food shop in suburban Chicago . she got fed up and quit . Miss Hamburger , a winsome 17-year-old , was a press agent 's dream come true when she applied for a job last summer at a Wendy 's outlet near her Barrington , Ill. , home . She hoped to earn some money toward entering art school after she graduates from high school this year . What she earned mostly was a lot of free publicity for Wendy 's hamburger chain in Chicago-area newspapers . And a little attention from R. David Thomas , founder and chairman of Wendy 's International Inc. , who mailed her an autographed photograph of himself . Until she walked out on a manager who threatened to fire her if she refused to work an extra turn on a holiday , she earned about 840 for 15 hours ' work a week . " It seemed , " she recalls , " like the job cost me more than I made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocratic bosses are hardly a new story to the millions of teen-agers that the fast-food industry depends upon to peddle the billions of hamburgers , fries and shakes it sells every year . But , like Wendy J. Hamburger , few youngsters realize when they apply for a fast-food job that they will be doing better than average if they do n't get disgusted and quit within four months . Some critics , in fact , contend that the fast-food chains , by and large , actually count on frequent turnover . Just about every job in these restaurants changes hands three or four times a year . In most businesses such turnover would be catastrophic . In the fast-food business it means almost everyone is paid the minimum wage and almost no one ever gets a merit raise or joins a union . " The whole system is designed to have turnover , " thus averting pay increases and frustrating organizing efforts , asserts Robert Harbrant , secretary-treasurer of the AFLCIO Food and Beverage Trades . Department in Washington , D.C. To be sure , a fast-food job is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have a hard time adjusting to the discipline of getting to work on time or even showing up every day . " You have about an 80% reliability factor , " says one restaurant executive whose chief complaint about his teen-age work force is that " about the time you get them trained they take off . " Cause . . . or Effect ? However , Harlow F. White , president of Systems for Human Resources Inc. , Mill Valley , Calif. , a management-consulting firm that recently did a national survey of food-service-employe attitudes , questions whether the 300% annual turnover of fastfood employes is a cause or an effect of the way the industry operates . In any event , he says , " the industry has managed to manufacture a self-fulfilling prophecy : ' We 're going to have turnover . And , by God , we do . ' " A sudden , sharp decline in employment turnover , Mr. White adds , would plunge the industry into turmoil , a development neither he nor anyone else sees as an imminent possibility . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes and four-fifths of hourly employes in the foodservice industry plan to get out of it . Operators of fast-food chains acknowledge that teen-age part-timers working for the minimum wage are the backbone of their business . But the operators deny that they purposely encourage turnover or do anything worse than to provide youngsters a chance to earn some spending money . " Turnover costs us money , " says a spokesman for the Burger King unit of Pillsbury Co. , even though " ii only takes a day or two " to train a new employe to a level of reasonable proficiency . Also , he says , there 's " nothing we can do about a lot of the turnover " because employes are students who only want the jobs for the summer or for a school term or two . Undercurrent of Discontent Despite such declarations of good intentions by executives at fast-food home offices , it is quickly evident that out in the field , at the restaurants themselves , there is a strong undercurrent of discontent and a feeling of being exploited among the unsophisticated young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instance , a black teen-age waitress complains that she has been scheduled to work a twohour day although It takes her more than two hours of riding time on city buses to get there and back home . ( A company official concedes this reflects " mismanagement at that store . " He says that if a worker is called in at all , " we have a written policy to pay them for a minimum of three hours . " ) In New York 's Westchester County , a Burger lUng keeps a 17-yearold applicant waiting expectantly for weeks before telling him It wo n't have an opening after all , costing him a month of job hunting and MOO In forgone pay . ( A Burger King spokesman says , " Unfortunately , things like that do happen . " He adds that the chain has installed a " new scheduling technique " that will allow better estimates of their future manpower ands . ) A suburban New York 's orders teen-age part4lmers to arrive up to an hour ahead of work time aid that " wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " says one such worker . ( " 111 bet it 's not a company-owned and operated location , " a company official says . ' That 's something we would n't condone . But I ta n't say it might n't happen in an isolated case:1 Teen-agers usually do n't know that the law requires that they be paid for such waiting time and that they be paid for even a few minutes of work that many of them do voluntarily before or after their work turn . Store managers should know better but often do n't . Richard Gilbert , a compliance official in the U.S. Labor Departnent 's wage and hour division . baits the storemanager training programs run by the home offices of franchise chains . He says . " We find in many cases that these 20-yearold managers are sales-oriented and cleanlinessoriented . But they are n't taught much about employe relations . And the Wage-Hour Law is just another three pages in the operating manual . " There 's a lot of agreement on that score from insiders and outsiders alike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Wendy 's , " recalls Miss Hamburger . " They needed managers so badly they hired anyone . They get a lot of young guys in there who think they 're Mr. Macho and want to exercise their power . They do n't know anything . " " They Call You Stupid " " I quit because I did n't like the way managers treated us , " says a 17-year-old who was cashier at an Atlanta 's last summer . The managers , she says , " are real snotty . They yell at the workers in front of customers and call you stupid . At the end of August , 15 of us quit because of one manager . Otherwise , most of us would have kept working after school . " The industry deserves much of the criticism , says the Burger King spokesman , for " putting young men or women in their early 20s in charge of a S1 million restaurant with 40 employes under age 18 and expecting them ( the managers ) to function " like professionals . As a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix a piece of equipment a lot easier than you can to deal with people . " To remedy this situation , he says the company is " formalizing people skills " as part of 10-day training courses for managers at its new $1.6 million Burger King University in Miami . Steak n Shake Inc. also is instituting reforms aimed at making employes happier . In addition to " refining our training program so it is n't so damn complicated . " says Thomas Delph , executive vice president , the company has started " listening " to its employes . One result : automatic pay increases for older employes when the muumum wage goes up . " Really , " Mr. Delph says of employe relations in the fast-food industry . " we 're all just learning in the past two or three yews . " The industry still has a lot to learn , if one believes the anonymous remarks scribbled co Mr. White 's firm 's survey questionnaires , which mese filled out by thousands of fastfood employes last summer and fall . A worker in Aria= @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . We seem to be constantly asked to work a double turn or nights oft " An Alabama worker wrote : " We have too many schedule changes . You never know when you will have to work . so it is hard to plan anything else ? ' Low pay is a constant irritant . A 16-yearold who quit an Atlanta Wendy 's last fall says be was " doing more work than I was getting paid for " at 52.65 an hour . " Sometimes I 'd have to work 12 hours a day . Other times there were n't enough of as for lunchtime crowds . One month we went through five assistant managers . When I get another job it wo n't be in fast foods ? ' James Badger . another 16-year-old. says in an interview that be learned more than he wanted to know about the fast-food business while working nights as a part-time bead cook for a Long John Silver 's outlet in Atlanta at SL60 an hour . One week , he says . " I could have sworn I earned US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a check for $47 . " A. he says . " we were supposed to be paid on Fridays . but often we did n't get our checks until Monday or Tuesday . " Another young Southerner said his only gripe was pay : " I receive 3206 an hour . I would like at least the minimum wage . " The national minimum wage was 52.65 in 1978 ; it increased to 32.90 on Jan . I. Numerous Violations While some small fast-food operations are exempt from the minimum-wage and overtime-pay provisions of federal law , most chains are covered and are subject to enforcement actions for failure to comply . Thus , in 1977 , Kentucky Fried Chicken of Middlesboro , Ky .. had to make up $2,086 in overtime pay to 35 employes . Last summer a Florida operator of Lam 's and Ranch House restaurants was ordered by federal court in Miami to reimburse $300.000 to 1.290 employes who were n't paid required minimum and overtime wages . And . in New Jersey . the Department of Labor last December charged 18 Burger King restaurants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep adequate wage reports . Similar cases dot court records in all parts of the country . To be sure , the survey found a number of fast-food employes who felt well-treated . " I like working here . " says an Alabama fastfood worker . " It gives me a chance to meet new people . " Another teen-ager , who makes 0.65 an hour as a Burger King food handler , says , " It 's a lot of fun . The managers are nice to work for . I work pretty much the time I want to . " And a young man working the counter in a Florida store says , " All the hard work is rewarding in the long run bemuse the manager is a friend , parent , counselor , adviser , teacher and boss . " More numerous , however , were comments such as the one from a counter employe in Texas who complained : " Management puts tremendous mental strain on the employes . We have all learned how to successfully steal enough money . . . to make working here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round the Clock The manager 's job is no bed of roses either . One young woman , who is paid $12,000 a year to run a 's franchise store that grosses more than $750,000 a year , declares , " They do n't pay managers enough . I 'm on my feet from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m . Often I do n't have time to eat all day . On days off I come in a couple of hours or call in to check on my assistant managers . And I have to take work borne , like the weekly scheduling . " 's officials say they ca n't control everything a licensee does but that managers of company-owned stores are better trained and paid . Stanley Stein , 's assistant vice president of employe relations , says that " we try to establish mutual respect " with employes . The company must be succeeding , he adds , because " we have n't had a union organizing attempt in four or five years , and we 've cut our turnover to maybe a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. White , the management consultant , says the industry has only itself to blame for employe ill-will . " Most ( store ) managers are very young and untrained , " he says , " insensitive rather than malicious in most cases . " In his report on the survey , he observed that " the industry does n't do the kind of manpower planning a labor-intensive environment demands , " and that this is resulting in " higher labor costs . " Nation 's Restaurant News , which sponsored the survey , echoes his warnings . " Unless food.service executives move quickly to develop an effective working relationship between top management and all unit employes  --  from general manager to dishwasher , " the trade publication declared recently . " the industry will soon face a labor-management debacle of crisis proportions . "
