THERE SHE IS : THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MISS AMERICA by Frank Deford. 351 pages . Viking . $10 . <P> <P> Threatened institutions , like endangered species , have often demonstrated remarkable powers of survival . There is the Roman Church , the British House of Lords , the German General Staff and the Miss America Pageant . Criticized as lily-white by civil rights groups , demonstrated against by Women 's Lib , condescended to by intellectuals and the New York Times ( which has been known to spare two paragraphs deep inside to report the winner ) , Miss America annually blooms like a crop of late summer corn . The second Saturday night in September always finds more than 60 million televiewers tuning in as , live from Atlantic City , Bert Parks opens the last envelope , milks the last drop of suspense , announces the winner and launches the pageant 's theme song : There She Is . <P> To get to that moment , the viewer has had to squirm through two hours of banal commentary , inane commercials and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also something for daddy-the swimsuit finals , which unwittingly mock the characteristic American dilemma of having to select from many tempting choices that all seem exactly alike . <P> CIA Work . Beneath the pampered hair , outdated-and sometimes padded-bathing suits , the girls are not all alike . Insofar as Frank Deford has managed to dig out the differences , There She Is is a genuine bit of Americana and camp sociology . The standouts , naturally , are those contestants who have remained in the public eye . Chesty Rosebud Blondell , unsuccessful in 1926 as Miss Dallas , went on to a film career as Joan Blondell . Lee Meriwether , Miss America 1955 , still combines television acting with movie roles . <P> Jean Bartel , Miss America 1943 , became a Broadway singer , but will probably be best remembered for her patriotism . In the year following her crowning , she sold more than $2,500,000 worth of war bonds . In the late 1940s she did a little CIA work in Lebanon . The most famous Miss America is undoubtedly New York City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a little too much truth in packaging at the 1945 pageant by tucking her 36-in. bust into a size 34 swimsuit . The most infamous beauty , alas , came from the pageant 's home state . Janice Hansen , Miss New Jersey 1944 , became a Mafia moll , a career that came up short in 1959 when she was killed by gangsters along with her companion , Anthony ( " Little Augie " ) Pisano . <P> Checks Preferred . The kind of controversy that really upsets Miss America officials , however , is generated by girls who are outspoken about the unabashed commercialism of it all . " It 's a form of prostitution , " said Amelita Facchiano , who as Miss Winston-Salem was eliminated in the 1970 Miss North Carolina contest . Maria Fletcher , the girl who won that competition in 1961 and went on to be Miss America , was more philosophical : " The sooner you realize you 're a product , the better . " Dressed , coiffured and paraded up and down , contestants are like dolls for moms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " represents no more than what the older generation thinks youth should represent . She is a puppet of middle-aged values . "
