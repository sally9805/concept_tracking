txt Hooded teen-agers gripping submachine guns and carbines patrol the streets of the Bogside . They control traffic , wave on motorists and stop strangers . " Who are you ? Where are you from ? Prove it ! " This the vigilantes demand as they stand beside the burned-out vehicles and floodlit barricades that seal the entrances to the Bogside and the adjoining Creggan and Brandywell areas . " Free Derry " ? the solidly Roman Catholic quarter where 33,000 of Londonderry 's 56,000 people live ? is a state within a state now , openly protected by both wings of the outlawed Irish Republican Army . There are no courts and no policemen , rents and taxes are not paid , and gas and electric bills are largely ignored . " If the army comes in here there 'd be a bloodbath , " said Thomas McCourt , the 24-yearold leader of the Official wing of the I.R.A . here . " Our job is ' defense and retaliation . We 're not cowboys with guns . We 're here to defend our people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bogside , 21-year-old Martin , the officer in charge of the Provisional wing , said : " The job , as far as I 'm concerned , is fighting the British Army . Ours is an offensive role . No one likes to kill . I do n't . But we 're at war . These people are invaders . " Since the arrival of the van guard of 15,000 British troops in Ulster in August , 1969 , the Catholics in Free Derry have gradually turned their enclave in this shabby city 70 miles from Belfast into a fortress barricaded with overturned trucks , barbed wire , stones and rubble . The last time soldiers moved in was on Jan. 30 , Bloody Sunday , when 13 civil-rights marchers were killed . Now the area is sealed and , for the first time , young I.R.A . vigilantes openly patrol the broken streets , whose surrounding walls , festooned with the Irish tricolor , bear scrawled slogans : " Irishmen avenge Irish dead " . . . " Beware soldiers ' dolls ? no Limey lovers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above Creggan Heights , which overlooks the Bogside , is an observation post with an airLondonderry has a peculiar place in Ulster 's mythology , and its history is embedded in the consciousness of all Irishmen . In the religious wars of the 17th century Londonderry , a Protestant stronghold , was never captured by the Catholics , who were forced to live outside the city gates in the flat , marshy " bogside . " The , ghetto is nestled beneath the city walls and their cannon , symbols of Protestant domination . Around the walls now are a handful of heavily barricaded British Army posts , manned by 2,400 soldiers who are under virtually constant threat from snipers and rock-throwing youths . Committees Maintain Service The two wings of the I.R.A . control security in the ghetto , but a collection of street committees , citizens ' groups and tenants ' associations maintain lists of carpenters and electricians , assure the collection ' of garbage and deal with the sick and elderly . " These structures give people a sense of order , and there is order here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Derry Citizens Central Council . " And people ' see the I.R.A . as the only force of protection . " Because the community cooperates with the home-grown police force , called the ? Peace Corps , petty thieves and vandals are quickly tracked down and dealt with , sometimes in a primitive fashion . Several youths who had repeatedly been warned to stop stealing have been tarred and feathered . In more extreme cases offenders have been shot in the leg . The two wings of the I.R.A . are cooperating , but their senior officers maintain a chilly , sometimes hostile relationship . Among teen-agers the links are closer and joining one wing ? as opposed to the other ? often depends on one 's neighborhood and who controls the block . The Bogside is heavily Provisional , the breakaway wing that relies on bombing and armed attack on the British soldiers . The Creggan area is dominated by the Officials , the more ideological and Marxist , group . We Want the Dedicated ' " We ca n't take all the lads that want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Officials , as he sat in a car near his home . " We want the dedicated . If a fellow says he just wants a gun , we tell him to go to the Provos . " We 're not bloody idiots. raid siren , which wails if the army approaches . Armed patrols work day and night . There is a vigilante for every street ( they work one night on and two nights off ) . Yet buses , often driven by Protestants , move in and out , taking children to the doctor or dentist and housewives downtown . Two Protestantowned bakeries deliver bread each morning . Milkmen and butchers ' vans and food trucks thread their way through . " It 's a normal society in an abnormal situation , " said Michael Havord , organizer of the Derry Civil Rights Association , in the group 's tiny headquarters in the Creggan area . " An Establishment in the normal sense does n't exist here . But there 's no anarchy . To most of us there 's more anarchy outside  --  where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constabulary ? than inside . " Bridget Bond , the mother of four sons and secretary of the civil-rights group , said : " The kids have nothing to do . No one 's working here . That 's the problem . They ca n't afford to take out girls . They ca n't go to a movie or a dance , And they ca n't and do n't go outside . " Londonderry has an unemployment rate of 18 per cent ; the figure in the Bogside is twice that . We 're not here for the showmanship . We want a 32-county socialist republic . We retaliate when we have to , when it 's necessary . We killed two British soldiers last week . " He explained that the killings were in retaliation for the killing of Joseph McCann , a popular I.R.A . leader in Belfast . " Sure , sometimes this business gets you down , " he continued . " Sometimes you see a few of the lads go across the , border to a dance . I 'd like to go too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . But then , well , you think , is any of that important ? " Beneath Creggan , in a house on the fringe of the Bogside , ' Mr. , the ProH visionals ' leader , sat with several associates , including Sean Keenen , the adjutant , whose brother was recently shot dead in a clash with the army . Asked about Provisional bombing attacks in which civilians are killed or wounded , Mr. spoke unemotionally . " Things are done for a reason , " he said . " No one likes to do some things . In Belfast there have been a few bad accidents , not in Derry . But tell me , what sin is there in a Confusion and Anticipation man fighting for his country ? " The take-over of Northern Ireland by the Government in London and the toppling of the bitterly resented Protestantdominated government here have stirred both confusion and anticipation . Even with the report by Lord Widgery , which absolved British soldiers of firing without provocation on Bloody Sunday , there is a glimmer of optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set things back here , but there 's still some hope  --  a little bit of it , " said the Rev. William Raf-I ferty , a frail , gray-haired priest ) at St. Columba 's Church in the Bogside . " We 're able to carry on , but life is not normal here . There 's a sense of disorder about things . " He stepped outside the church . Two dozen yards away two masked youths with machine guns had set up a checkpoint to investigate strangers . " What can we do but carry on ? " he asked . " What 's going to happen ? The children are hero-worshipers . This morning an 8-year-old lad said in class that it was all right to throw stones at soldiers because they should't be there . The children think it 's great what the I.R.A . is doing . " Referring to William Whitelaw , the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , he added : " It 's most difficult to be hopeful about any of this , but Whitelaw is trying to ease things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he will .
