txt On the eve of Bert Lance 's testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , evidence was growing that President Carter was " hanging tough " and that the resignation of his budget director might not follow his testimony almost automatically . Despite a stream of evidence up to now that a Lance resignation was imminent : ? Mr. Lance himself is very pointedly and repeatedly saying he will not resign ? underscoring this with a reporter to indicate he intends to stay where he is . ? President Carter , according to press secretary . Jody Powell , will make a judgment only after Mr. Lance has had " his day in court . " But in no way is the President indicating how that judgment will go . Mr. Powell keeps insisting that the President has not in any way decided that Mr. Lance 's record has become so debilitating to his administration that he should step down . Thus , the assessment of close-in observers in this city is shifting a bit . Until Tuesday the feeling was that Mr. Lance would talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter expressing his great regret for losing an able public servant and loyal friend . Now there is a growing doubt about this thesis . Could it be , some are asking , that if Mr. Lance emerges from the hearings without being charged with illegal actions in his personal and banking practices , he will survive , at least for a while longer ? Some of this emerging new theory stems from the way the administration ? notably Mr. Powell ? has been scrapping back in an effort to assist Mr. Lance . Mr. Powell in an action he later called " inappropriate , regrettable , and dumb " ? a judgment he said the President concurred in ? passed along to a Chicago newspaper rumors that // From page 1 Lance exit appears to be less imminent Sen. Charles H. Percy ( the top Republican in the Senate committee before which Mr. Lance was to testify ) improperly used corporate aircraft and other facilities . On the morning of Sept. 15 Mr. Powell called to apologize to Senator Percy for this unfounded " leak , " and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Powell " regrets . " The allegations involved in the " leak " ? ? which Mr. Powell said he told the repOrter to check for accuracy and truth before using ? were : That the Senator had regularly flown on aircraft owned by Bell &; Howell Company and that there were reports that he used an airplane , meeting rooms , security guards , and other facilities of the First National Bank of Chicago during his 1972 re-election campaign and did not reimburse the bank fully . Senator Percy denies these charges , saying : " I have never ridden on a Bell &; Howell plane . Bell &; Howell has never owned an airplane . . . and has never leased an airplane for me . " Percy spokesmen add that any expenses in-cared by the bank were reimbursed . Thus , it seems that the White House ? certainly some of those around the President and very close to him ? is still battling to save Bert Lance . ? - Does this " hang tough " position reflect the attitude of Mr. Carter ? One White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wanting to be scrupulously fair to Mr. Lance and not prejudging guilt . This position , Mr. Powell says , is one from which Mr. Carter , after viewing the Lance testimony , may decide to ask for the Lance resignation . But at this point it seems that Mr. Lance is not going to leave voluntarily . And , beyond that , the door seems open , perhaps just a crack , for Mr. Carter to decide to stick with Mr. Lance after all .
