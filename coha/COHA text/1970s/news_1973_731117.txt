txt A senior government official tells a stunned audience of businessmen and reporters that Japan may be facing a severe economic recession that could last three to four years . A few blocks away , frantic shoppers , flush with yearend bonuses , mob a department store , buying almost anything in sight . A salesgirl says that luxury Items , such as Joy perfume , which sells for about $143 an ounce , and $300 handbags are selling especially well . Several of the nation 's largest manufacturers announce that a shortage of oil and electricity will force them to reduce production 10% to 30 ' ; ' , next quarter . At the same time , organized labor says it will demand 20% to 30% pay increases during the 1974 " spring wage offensive . " Many companies predict that an increase of at least 20 ' 7 will be granted . Private and government economists warn that Japan 's fuel supplies are dwindling quickly and that serious shortages could crop up as early as next month . But the streets and highways , even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Big Importer No industrialized nation , at least on paper , is more vulnerable to a prolonged oil squeeze than Japan . It imports about 1.6 billion barrels of oil a year  --  more than any other nation -- and about 45% of its crude comes from those Arab nations that have been restricting their supplies . Domestically , it produces only a trace of oil , and , unlike the U.S. , it is devoid of most other natural resources as well . As a result , a long-run oil shortage will bring severe economic dislocations and will lead to the development of new and uncertain relationships . Even if the Arabs lift the oil cutbacks they have recently imposed , it is unlikely that they will agree to increase production as much as the Japanese say they must for this country to maintain its high growth rates . Yet , despite this vulnerability , no country 's population or government seems to have done less to prepare for the crisis that a prolonged oil shortage will bring . Of course , the possibility of a crisis has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the shortages during World War II , have begun hoarding rice , toilet paper , detergents and several basic staples . For some persons , sugar has replaced Scotch as a popular Christmas gift . The government has asked major power companies voluntarily to restrict supplies to heavy industrial users . And some of the gaudy , Ginza-style neon-light displays that every major shopping area seems so proud of have been turned off . But while the British make plans for a three-day workweek and Sunday driving bans spring up through the rest of Europe , the Japanese sit and wait . Why the delay ? Some critics attribute it to government incompetence . Others suggest that the nation is suffering from a debilitating trauma that prevents any action . But conversations with government and business leaders and with economists and academics suggest that the government has been working diligently  --  but behind the scenes  --  preparing for the changes that are likely to come . And they present several reasons for the government 's waiting as long as it has to act . The Need for Acceptance They note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will somehow get the oil they need from non-Arab sources or that Japanese diplomacy will succeed in getting more oil from the Arabs . But more importantly , they argue that the Japanese government must delay its actions as long as possible , using the time to build public acceptance for the drastic measures that will have to he taken . Government officials deny that they have n't been working on the problem . Officials of all the ministries dealing with economic problems say they are working late at night and on weekends . Two senior officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have recently been hospitalized for treatment of exhaustion , a spokesman says . The Japanese are trying to increase their investment in oil and gas exploration around the world . And in recent days they have shown a willingness to pay whatever is necessary to get oil and to get it wherever they can . Yesterday , for example , the Japanese government decided to allow Japanese companies to bid for Libyan crude oil . Some of that crude is reported to be " hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to but which Libya says it has the right to sell . But in doing so , the Japanese run the risk of alienating the major international oil companies , which currently provide this country with about 70% of its oil . Some Japanese officials say the " majors " are already diverting oil to the U.S. that was hound for Japan from non-Arab countries . And there Is some fear that these diversions might increase should the Japanese challenge the majors too severely . A Foreign-Policy Change The prospect of fuel shortages has also cooled relations with the U.S. It has forced Japan to move toward a foreign policy that is less dependent on American leadership than it has been since World War 11 . The Japanese have already shifted to a pro-Arab stance In the hope that it will get them more oil . And they have shown a distinct reluctance to embrace wholly Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's proposal for joint energy actions . There are major problems for the Japanese and are taxing this nation 's decision-making process . Even when problems are small , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a government agency or executives of a corporation will discuss a problem at length and at all levels of the organization before acting . But once the decision is made , it has the support of everyone it affects . At present , it is unclear whether the Japanese government has the time to build support for the measures it is expected to begin taking next month . " It will help if the government can hold off until after other crountries have taken drastic measures , " one political scientist here says . " That way they can show that Japan is n't alone in its suffering . " Many government officials privately fear that the failure to build this public support could lead to a serious increase in hoarding commodities and to possible panic by consumers unable to get essential goods . In addition . some officials fear that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party 's control of Japan could be seriously weakened unless it can convince the public that the fuel-saving measures are necessary and that the government did everything it could to avoid them . The Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ' leisince 1960 , and the people just now are becoming comfortable with the affluence that their " economic miracle " has created . Thus , unless the government elicits their backing , the people may be rudely shocked . when Tokyo finally takes action to conserve fuel ? measures that almost everyone agrees will be severe . For one thing , the government is expected to order power companies to cut supplies to industrial users by at least 20C ; . In addition , last weekend Yasuhiro Nakasone , the international trade and industry minister , said that the government may have to suspend power to households a few hours a day . ( Other ministry officials say , however , that such suspensions are n't likely soon and will come only es a last resort . ) The government also is likely to put into effect the whole range of measures already taken in Europe . These include bans on pleasure driving and earlier closings for bars and restaurants . But these measures still may not be drastic enough . One reason is that restrictions on driving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effect in Japan as they would have in , say , the U.S. That 's because Japan uses a far greater percentage of its petroleum supplies for industry . Further , the oil shortage comes as the Japanese economy is suffering from its worst inflation in at least 20 years . The Bank of Japan announced last week that the wholesale price index rose 3.2% in November , pushing it 22.3% above a year earlier . And many economists are expecting an even larger jump in the index in December . The continued inflation is expected to force the Bank of Japan to tighten further its already-tight money policies . As a result , " we expect to be faced with a flood of corporate bankruptcies by April or May , " one Japanese banker says . " And it will get worse as the year goes on because so many companies depend on high economic growth to provide the cash flow they need to stay afloat . " This suggests one more reason for the government 's holding off on tough fuel-saving measures . Late December is the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for favors bestowed during the past year . The Japanese " might as well finish with it before settling in for the crunch , " one observer says . " It may be the Ir.st chance to give such gifts for quite a while . "
