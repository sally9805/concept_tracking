Dennis Barrett , in camouflage fatigues and walrus mustache , is telling about the first man he killed . " He was running toward me and I got him with 18 bullets right in the chest , brrrrrrrt ! So I go over to where he went down , and he 's not there . I finally find his body 50 ft. away . Now it seems medically impossible he could have crawled that far with his heart and lungs tore clean out like that . But one thing you have to learn is that people do n't die the way they do in John Wayne movies . It 's disheartening . " <P> Barrett , now 30 and a policeman , learned that lesson a decade ago in Viet Nam . This morning he is passing it on to about 50 men and women assembled in a rude , tin-roofed shed behind a convincing replica of George Washington 's Mount Vernon home , only 20% larger . Barrett is ripe with other combat wisdom : " If you bring an enemy down , do n't run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him time to die ... When things break down there 's going to be an initial surge of people from the cities . They 'll kill you for a can of sardines ... You should band together with a few other families , because you 're going to need all the firepower you can get . If you have a nine-or ten-year-old kid , teach him how to shoot ... Get yourself a good guard dog . And if worse comes to worst and you run out of food , you can eat him . " <P> Barrett is teaching a class in " Special Weapons and Tactics , " one of the several dozen survival-related courses offered at this fall 's Freedom Festival . The weekend gathering is sponsored by the Christian-Patriots Defense League at its 55-acre headquarters on the outskirts of rural Louisville , Ill. ( pop . 1,000 ) , four hours and a million rows of corn south of Chicago . The festival has drawn 1,500 men , wom en and children from as far away as Mexico and Oregon . Clad in overalls , pedal pushers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent every age group , income bracket , occupation-but only one race . " You 're welcome to join us , as long as you 're white , " John R. Harrell , founder of the league , said over the phone a few days earlier . " We work with all races , but we do n't believe in mixing them . We feel that almost 50% of the world 's problems are caused by the mixing of races , which we believe to be totally against the natural makeup of man . <P> This is a Caucasian meeting only . We 'll get together with other races elsewhere . " <P> Harrell , 57 , is a white-haired former millionaire ( mausoleums , real estate ) with a radio preacher 's voice and the affable manner of a small-town politician . He founded the league 's progenitor , the Christian Conservative Churches of America , two decades ago , between a bout with lymph cancer ( he won ) and his 1960 campaign to be one of Illinois ' U.S. Senators ( he lost ) . Shortly after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington and a home for his family of nine-federal agents battered down the gate with an armored personnel carrier , and arrested him for harboring an alleged Marine deserter . <P> Harrell spent four years in prison , was cited for failing to file income tax returns since 1953 and says he still owes the Government more than $500,000.
