Without trees , a tropical ecosystem turns wasteland <P> The scorching sun roasts the skeletons of jacaranda trees . The soil , dry and hard , looks like baked clay . Rivers , once navigated by 5,000-ton ships , are now so choked by sand bars that a canoe can barely nose through . Bridges cross dry gulches overgrown with weeds and shrubs . Many once plentiful plants and birds are gone , and human beings who live there are disfigured by skin cancer . The scene is 300 sq . mi. in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo , a once lush strip north of Rio de Janeiro that is now on its way to becoming a desert . The cause of this ecological disaster : man . <P> Some three decades ago , descendants of German Pomeranian immigrants , who had farmed in Brazil 's mountains for a hundred years , moved toward the coast and settled in the tropical Atlantica forest . Clearing the land for farming , these settlers burned valuable jacaranda and peroba trees . Once a road was built , the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chain saws , who cut down the rest of the forest . Any wood not exported was consigned as fuel to Brazil 's burgeoning steel industry . <P> " The area went from forest to zero , " laments Brazilian Environmentalist Augusto Ruschi . " There were no gradual , intermediate stages . Within 20 years , the Atlantica forest was turned into pasture lands and coffee plantations , and now the area is marching toward desertification . " The process is hastened by decreased rainfall . Even when it does rain the water runs off quickly , because there are no tree roots left to hold it . Nutrients are washed away , and the land can barely support the Pomeranians ' cattle and subsistence crops . <P> As a result , the entire ecosystem is completely off balance . During the past 20 years , at least 450 varieties of plants and 204 species of birds have disappeared from the region . With so many of their natural enemies gone , pests and parasites have proliferated , attacking grass , leaves and fruit . Says Farmer Franz Hummel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all full of bugs . " <P> Plants and birds are not the only things to suffer . Says Dr. Douglas Puppin , chairman of the dermatology department at the Federal University of Espirito Santo : " Ninety percent of the people I examine from that area have skin cancer or precancerous lesions . " The reason : the light-skinned Pomeranians have far less melanin , a protective pigment , than most other , darker-skinned Brazilians . With the trees gone , says Puppin , " children are constantly in the sun . We try to warn them , but you ca n't expect kids to walk around in hats and long sleeves in the midday heat .
