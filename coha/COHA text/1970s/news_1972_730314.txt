txt The General Accounting Office , despite finding " measurable progress " in the Pentagon 's armspurchasing procedures , reported today an increase of $28.7-billion between the original and the current cost estimates of 77 weapon systems . " A considerable amount of the cost growth related to the acquisition of weapon systems is directly attributable to unrealistic cost estimates , " the 68-page report concluded . The same observation has often been made by critics of the Pentagon 's arms procurement procedures , and the report stressed the need for " consistent and effective cost-estimating procedures . " The cost changes " are not cost growth in the sense of measuring cost increases for identical programs , " the report said , adding that the changes measure a number of factors besides pure growth in the cost of a weapon as it was originally conceived . The other factors are inflation , cost estimating , quantities , weapon systems capabilities ? that is , a change in the expected performance goals  --  and changes in delivery schedules . Regarding the change in // quantities , the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons to be purchased , thus driving up their per-unit cost . " The effect of that kind of change is obvious , " the G.A.O . said in its annual report . " Program costs go down and individual unit costs go up . " The report added : " Not so obvious , but perhaps far more significant , is the impact of these quantity reductions on interrelated weapon programs , all of which are part of an over-all plan . " Thus , for example , a decision to reduce the number of nuclear-powered , guided-missile frigates would eliminate the need for an expensive missile system , called AEGIS , But this missile system would have to be modified substantially to fit on other ships . The G.A.O. , the investigative arm of Congress , said its report on arms purchasing was made because " the investment to acquire major Department of Defense weapons makes a heavy impact on both short and long-term , allocations of the nation 's resources . " Citing Congressional attention on improving the process , the agency said there was " evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases , been conducted efficiently . " But progress in arms development and buying , the report said , can be seen in the slowdown in cost growth . Last year , the report found a 40 per cent increase on 61 weapon ' systems . The current increase of $28.7-billion represents an increase of 31 per cent . The report covers only a little more than half of the 141 weapon systems under development . It is estimated that these 141 systems , which include everything from airplanes to tank-mounted guns , will cost more than $162-billion ; of this amount , about $93-billion has not yet been appropriated by Congress . The two " overriding factors " influencing poor cost estimates , according to the cost study , are the " lack of completeness of a plan stating what should be done , and inadequate documentation on what was done and how and why it was done . " In an appendix to the report , John S. Foster Jr. , the Pentagon 's director of research and engineering , said steps had been taken since June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to improve the practices under scrutiny . Representative Les Aspin , Democrat of Wisconsin , who has frequently criticized the Pentagon , said the report demonstrated that " when the cost overruns begin to mount , then , rather than cut costs , the Pentagon cuts the number of units to be purchased . " The G.A.O . made the following recommendations to Secre.tary of Defense Melvin R. Laird : ( 1IHe should emphasize rigorous analysis of the need for new weapons and consider the usefulness of equipment already in the inventory . 4He should make clearer , " on a case-by-case basis , " the role of weapons-project managers . In the past , the agency has recommended the upgrading of the project manager 's stature and training . qHe should develop and implement consistent and effective cost-estimating practices and procedures in the various services . qHe should do the same for testing and evaluation procedures . The report found that " test plans were unduly optimistic and success-oriented , " adding that waivers were granted too often to overcome the requirement that engineering tests be completed before production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " selected acquisition reporting , " which involves a study of the costs of developing and producing some of the current weapon systems .
