txt surrounding Jupiter , Pioneer 10 has cleared the way for future exploration of the outer solar system . Jupiter , with more than twice the gravity of ' earth , is the powerful slingshot that can fling spacecraft out to Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto . But to do so the probes must swing close to the massive planet . In a week , project scientists must make the decision on where they will retarget Pioneer11 , asistershia still threading its way through the asteroid belt . They can send it in closer at the equator , make it pass over one of the poles , or target it on the opposite side of the giant planet so that Jupiter 's gravity will hurl the spacecraft on its way to Saturn . // *Radiation no bar to future flights // To make it to Saturn , the second Pioneer must skim within 21,000 miles of Jupiter 's surface . That is 60,000 miles deeper mto the radiation belts than Pioneer 10 has just penetrated A difficult decision / According to Dr John Wolfe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to make . Because of the short time the investigators will have to examine their data , and the radical differences between the Jovian and terrestrial magnetic environments , estimates of the radiation strengths that much closer to the planet will be mostly guesswork . Whether or not the next Pioneer goes to Saturn , a series of spacecraft now being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) will use Jupiter 's gravity to boost them to the outer planets . About 1977 a Mariner spacecraft will be launched to Saturn by way of JUpiter . It will pass much farther from Jupiter than Pioneer 10 just did . Following this , other Mariners will be dispatched to Uranus and perhaps Neptune , each given a Jovian boost . Part of broad program These are part of an overall plan of exploration that hopefully will send spacecraft to every major planet by the end of the 1980 's . The drama this week was intense , meanwhile ? Until Pioneer 10 passed within 81,000 milesof Jupiterwithout a single failure Monday night , physical scientists had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the radio noise coming from the planet , astronomers knew that Jupiter , the most mysterious planet in the solar system , had a magnetic field . And in this field there must be charged particles trapped in radiation belts similar to those surrounding Earth . If these particles were numerous enough , and energetic enough , they could easily destroy the delicate electronics essential to a spacecraft . Bristling with particle detectors and a super-sensitive compass that measures magnetic field strengths , Pioneer forged into Jupiter 's magnetic field and radiation belts . It found that they were totally different from Earth 's and much less damaging than scientists had feared . Tension grew steadily here as everyone waited for the magnetic field and energetic particle fluxes to begin climbing in strength . It was not until the spacecraft was a few hours before its point of closest approach that all the particle counters " lit up . " However , the scientists greatest concern did not materialize . The concentrations of high-energy protons that many had predicted , and which would have inflicted the Most damage , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as strong as found around Earth . Electrons , on the other hanb , nose to levels a million times higher than those found in the terrestrial belt ? comparable to the intensity found within a solar flare .
