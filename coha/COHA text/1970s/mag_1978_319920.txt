Appearances to the contrary , Upstairs , Downstairs Producer John Hawkes-worth has not settled down in my lady 's parlor . True , his new 15-part Masterpiece Theater presentation , a joint venture of the BBC and TIME-LIFE Television , has several things in common with its award-winning and much-beloved predecessor . Chief among these are intelligence and taste . The series is as handsomely produced , the Edwardian settings and costumes as lush and authentic , as any devotee of 165 Eaton Place could possibly wish . But Louisa Leyton , the heroine of The Duchess of Duke Street , would never pass muster with Hudson or Mrs. Bridges . She is impertinent , aggressive , and , worst of all , neither keeps her peace nor knows her place . <P> Louisa 's story is modeled on the real-life exploits of Rosa Lewis ( 1867-1952 ) , a legendary Londoner who started her career as a Cockney skivvy , became for a time a mistress to the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , and wound up as the proprietor of the Cavendish Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Successes like Rosa 's require bullheadedness and a certain animal cunning , qualities that Actress Gemma Jones mimes impressively . Her Louisa is a furious wren , an unbreakable China doll with a chin shaped like an eggshell and hard as a rock . " I just wan na be the best cook in England , " she decides early and proceeds to bowl over the world that stands in her way . " What the bleedin ' ' ell ? " she hollers in florid Cockney when things go wrong . Pity the nobleman who tries to seduce her . " Push off , " Louisa ripostes . <P> The first several episodes launch this redheaded terror on an unsuspecting world . Louisa learns to cook at a grand London house and attracts the attention of the Prince of Wales . Naturally , she must marry someone else immediately . " The prince would never seek to compromise a single lady , " explains the royal equerry . Louisa rails at this " conspeyeracy " but bows to sovereign fate and marries Mr. Trotter , the butler ( played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The prince sets them up in a London house designed for discreet visits . In quick succession , Victoria dies , the new King finds that he must bow to propriety and stop going out nights , Trotter turns to drink . Louisa buys the Bentinck , a hotel going out at the seams , and returns to the kitchen . <P> After these high , fast steps , The Duchess of Duke Street hits its stride . The hotel provides a center for succeeding episodes , and a staff of regular characters assembles . There is Mary ( Victoria Plucknett ) , Louisa 's adoring assistant , and Major Smith-Barton ( Richard Vernon ) , a guest at the hotel who becomes his landlady 's sidekick and confidant . Comic relief appears with Merriman ( John Welsh ) , a teetering old headwaiter , and Starr ( John Cater ) , the imperturbable hall porter . Asked by Louisa during his job interview whether he fought in the Boer War , Starr gazes at her evenly and pauses . " Very possibly , " he finally answers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrrell , alternately Louisa 's benefactor , lover and friend .
