 | TEN QUESTIONS COUPLES ASK MARRIAGE COUNSELORS MOST THE nervous young couple explained to their marriage counselor why they needed help . They mentioned constant arguments , a growing dissatisfaction with sex , a feeling that their love was fading . They wanted to know who was at fault . Finally , the wife sighed and said . apologetically , " I guess you 've heard all this a thousand times . " " She is right , " says C. Ray Fowler , executive director of the American Association of Marriage and Family Counselors ( AAMFC ) . " Though every marriage is unique , the main problems of troubled spouses tend to be similar . Certain basic questions are asked time and again . " What questions ? And how do veteran counselors respond to them ? To find out , I enlisted the cooperation of the 3000-member AAMFC , the largest professional organization in its field. * A consensus of these experts yielded the following . 1 . Why do n't we love each other the way we used to ? " Couples are hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lessening , " observes Selma Miller , president of the New York chapter of AAMFC . " They seem to think love exists in a vacuum , permanently untarnishable . " But the " best foot forward " behavior of courtship ca n't be maintained throughout a marriage . And the demands and strains of jobs , children , illness and financial worries almost inevitably tend to erode intimacy . " Spouses must make an effort if intimacy is to stay at peak level , " says counselor Barry Cavaghan of Sacramento , Calif . " A marriage  | needs attention ? regular infusions of zest , innovation and mutual selfdisclosure . " He suggests that every couple ask themselves : " Is our marriage a priority commitment , or do we give it only the leftovers of our time and energy ? " He remembers a professional couple whose lives were so hectic they were becoming strangers to each other . They made a rule to go away one weekend a month , without their children , to recapture the joys of being alone together . 2 . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif. , counselor , tells of spending an hour listening to a couple exchange accusations . When she suggested they pay less attention to recriminations and more to the feelings behind them , the wife said , " That is n't necessary . We just want to know who 's right . " Perhaps the hardest job a counselor has is to convince a spouse that there is almost never a right or wrong side in marital conflict , says therapist Gordon Osborne of Salem , Ore . There are only different sides . One device counselors use to get couples to accept these differences is " role reversal " ? having partners switch sides in arguments , or do each other 's chores for a while . A husband who refuses to raise his wife 's food allowance may change his tune after he does the marketing a few times . 3 . Is n't our problem really a sexual one ? A couple in their mid-20s recently told therapist Selma Miller they were sexually incompatible . " I soon found they had many deep emotional conflicts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen to avoid facing them . " Today 's sexual freedom allow spouses to do this unconsciously . I is no longer shameful to admit on has a sexual problem when Master/ and Johnson estimate that at lea half the couples in the nation ha them . The current emphasis on . therapy encourages the false bell that sex is the most important part of marriage and that solving a sex problem is a marital panacea . Obviously , some couples who have a basically good relationship may have sexual difficulties . But counselors know that in most cases sex problems are indicative of other conflicts . " When there is trouble in any area of marriage it is likely to show up in bed as well , " says John Cornpere , a counselor in Winston-Salem , N.C. Compere tells of a client who thought she was frigid . " But it gradually became clear that she felt her husband took her for granted , was insensitive , showed no affection except when he wanted intercourse . " After the couple and the counselor worked on these problem areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 . Why do we have so much dissension when our sex life is so good ? This question can also mask the real problem . " We often find that sex is really not so marvelous for some who say it is , " says San Diego therapist Johanna Lessner . But couples who do enjoy their sexual relationship despite conflicts need to be reassured that their feel-72  | ings are acceptable . " A client told me , " says Selma Miller , " that if she makes love with her husband right after they 've had a fight she feels like a prostitute . Most of us were raised with the idea that good sex goes with a good marriage . So if we have good sex in a poor marriage we feel guilty . Actually , sexual closeness can be an asset , giving a couple a reason to work out conflicts . " 5 . Is it too late to change things ? " It is never too late , " says Seattle counselor Robert Buchanan , " if a couple still feel some love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward change that is the key factor . " Barry Cavaghan cites four categories of clients who are likely to resist change , since they really want the marriage to fail : 1 ) a young partner who feels the marriage is stifling personal growth ; 2 ) a middle-aged person who is driven to seek freedom out of fear that life is passing too quickly ; 3 ) a spouse who has made a decision to leave the other at a certain time ? " I 'll wait until the kids are grown " ; 4 ) anyone who explicitly " wants out " but enters counseling to prove he or she " tried . " 6 . How can we keep our parents from interfering in our marriage ? Young couples tend to think that pressure from parents and in-laws is a thing of the past . But they find that in one sense their parents are always with them . The values , habits and attitudes instilled during formative years linger forever . This parental influence mainly affects one 's sexual life . " About 90 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , " says John Compere . " What information they did get was mostly biological ? and filled with moral warnings . Almost no one was told that sex is a loving , giving , pleasurable experience . " As a result , many people find it difficult to be free about sex , or to enjoy it . Says Lyn Wabrek , co-director of the Sex Therapy Program at Connecticut 's Hartford Hospital , " A person may consciously or unconsciously try to identify with a parent 's sexual attitudes , or to rebel against them . In either case the attempt distracts from sexual awareness and arousal . Fortunately , professional counseling can help . " 7 . Why ca n't we talk without arguing so much ? Perhaps fhe most common failing in marriage is poor communication . Some couples retreat into silence ; others argue . Counselor Lucy Ulman of Newton , Mass. , tells of a couple who did both . She gave them communication exercises : " I asked them to talk about anything at all for 30 uninterrupted minutes every day . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarize what the other said . This enforces careful listening . After three months the couple reported that arguments between them had become rare . " 8 . Can I ever forgive my spouse for being unfaithful ? Statistics show that one out of two husbands and one out of five wives have been unfaithful at least once . Yet infidelity is always hurtful . Nursing the wound  | or seeking revenge only works further harm . But if a spouse makes an honest effort to learn the reasons behind the adultery , forgiveness may be possible and sensible . " In many instances unfaithfulness is a message about something wrong in the marriage , " says Los Angeles therapist Nathan Hurvitz . He suggests some questions a spouse might ask . Was it an isolated act of infidelity or a continuing liaison ? Was it prompted by revenge ? Boredom ? Curiosity ? The challenge of making a conquest ? A need to enhance one 's ego ? A poor sexual relationship within the marriage ? Careful consideration can help a person decide whether he or she can ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness ; each partner must make his or her own decision . 9 . Will counseling help ? How long will it take ? How much will it cost ? Counselors estimate that twothirds of all clients are helped . Success depends more on a couple 's determination to solve their problem than on the therapist 's skill . Counseling may take anywhere from a few weeks to a year or longer , depending on the goals and how willingly a couple work toward them . Some counselors offer trial periods , or set a specific number of sessions ? usually four to ten ? during which a couple move toward an agreedupon goal . This " time contract " can be extended , shortened or renewed . Counseling costs also vary . Social and public agencies may offer free therapy or set nominal fees geared to family income . Counselors in private practice charge from $15 to $6o an hour . Some group-insurance policies may cover counseling costs if a doctor certifies the therapy is necessary for " marital health . " 10 . Do marriage counselors have marital problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Graduate School of Social Work , tells of the client who asked : " Mrs. Cowley , do n't you have any problems in your marriage ? " " Of course , " the counselor replied . " Problems are inevitable in every relationship . To not have problems ' is an unrealistic goal . What 's important is to have ways of solving them . " But not even counselors can always solve their own problems . They fight , get separated and divorced just like ordinary mortals . Says Nathan Hurvitz , " The fact that we know how a good partner is supposed to act , think and feel does not mean that we can always act , think or feel that way ourselves . " Which only means that marriage counselors , like other husbands and wives , sometimes need marriage counselors !
