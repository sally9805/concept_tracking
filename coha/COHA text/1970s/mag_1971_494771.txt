DECEMBER 11 , 1971 This happy Christmas season is the time for peace on earth and good will towards men . It 's a time for gifts and the warmth of family and friends . It 's a time that 's as fragile as a snowflake ... a time that melts into memory all too soon . It is also a time when the utter despair of people living in desperate poverty becomes more painful . Because they are the hopeless ones , the forgotten ones , in remote villages and barrios of Asia ' and South America . Human beings whose only chance to live like human beings may be through the help of Foster Parents Plan ? and you . If you believe , as we do , that the spirit of Christmas should last all year , wo n't you please become a Foster Parent ? For just $16.00 a month you can work a miracle .

Now , when your own world is so full of-happiness , wo n't you make room in your heart for a Foster Child ? Send a gift of happiness . You can actually give , what will seem to a child , Christmas ... 365 days a year ! You can help take the " humbug " out of the holiday . In a collection of thirty-four essays Herbert Muller looks back over his life as scholar , teacher , writer and citizen , and meditates on his and his culture 's values . He ponders America 's seediness , and the diminished ( but he thinks still crucial ) role of history . He clings with many reservations to a notion of progress ( but rejoices in the knowledge that he " will not live to see the year 2000 " ) . He reconsiders various important persons in his intellectual life such as de Toqueville and William James , and reflects with a lofty liberal 's sense of irony about the morality of our leaders . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is now spending more and more of his time in Mexico . An author setting out to cope with such marvelous subjects as the Bobbsey Twins , Rover Boys , Tom Swift , Hardy Boys , Nancy Drew and Tarzan has to work hard to let us down . Arthur Prager does . He has no thesis . His method is to quote some of the more ridiculous passages in novel after novel , note they are racist , hawkish , prudish , or mildly pornographic , then move on to another example . Not an analysis or even a collection , the book is a heap . The Tarzan novels attracted Prager as a boy because their setting was Africa and because their scenes included de-bloused white flesh . But then there was no sniff of sex in the Bobbsey Twins ' adventures , hardly a bed appeared in Tom Swift , hardly a blouse ( when they appear , they 're buttoned ) . Because he read over 400 different children 's series novels , Prager surely qualifies as a national resource , a kind of Smithsonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no catalogue . The usual assumption is that popular art will reveal the tastes and manners , the social and psychological relations , of its creators and consumers . Prager is not interested in such assumptions ; not arguing for or against them , his implication is that kids are all different , that there is no point in trying to find similarity in the soft porn of Tarzan and the ammoniac well-lighted place that is a Nancy Drew story . Prager 's way of putting it has discrete authors and discrete publishers as entrepreneurs doing their discrete things ; a more serious book would have shown how these novels were or were not contributive to a pattern of social hegemony . He might also have asked , since he had the information , how the children 's novel industry related to , say , the present children 's TV industry . There are striking parallels . The Nancy Drew , Bobbsey Twins , Hardy Boys , Tom Swift , Rover Boys , and many other less known series books all had one author : Edward Stratemeyer . At first working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 800 novels in this one lode , before he died and left the Stratemeyer Syndicate to his daughter , Harriet S. Adams , who still turns them out anew and rewrites the old . Before Stratemeyer 's day , Horatio Alger , Jr . composed 119 children 's novels single-handedly ( and these Prager does not even deal with ) . But it was Stratemeyer who best anticipated the centralized and sophisticated techniques of Hollywood and TV with his assembly-line staff filling in plot outlines to keep several novels rolling out every week , all on an eight-to-five schedule . The phobias modern man already has , but he needs new names and images for them if he is to keep up intellectually with his own decline from peace and sanity . Robert Osborn , assisted by Eve Wengler , provides them in an amusing collection of cartoons to accompany such well-known conditions as Odontiatrophobia ( fear of dentists ) , Doxophobia ( fear of opinions ) , and Autophobophobia ( fear of one 's own fears ) .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
