DEATH WISH <P> Directed by MICHAEL WINNER Screenplay by WENDELL MAYES <P> Death Wish starts out as if it were going to make extraordinary demands on the audience 's ability to accept and sustain a fantasy . Right off , one is asked to believe that Charles Bronson , who usually acts as if he has trouble writing his own name , is an engineer of such skill and imagination that he can one-two-three redesign a housing development so that its aesthetic merits can be retained even as a soaring cost factor is brought into line . Soon enough , however , the film settles down to real business . This is not to make any demands on fantasies but to cater to what may currently be the most vicious of them , namely that the problem of crime in the streets is so far out of control that vigilantism is the only way to bring about a final solution . <P> Bronson takes the law into his own hands mainly as occupational therapy after three freaks invade his New York apartment , murder his wife and sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A weapon of revenge-a Western-style revolver-is provided by the grateful realtor whose development Bronson saved . A pressing , almost daily need to use it is supplied by British Director Winner and West Coast Writer Mayes , who offer a vision of New York City existence based less on firsthand experience than on old Johnny Carson-Dick Cavett monologues about getting home from the studio . Everywhere Bronson turns in a trash-and graffiti-glutted environment , he sees an old man mugged , a car being burglarized-and his gun is quick . Pretty soon he is stalking the gloomiest streets , the dimmest parks , the grimiest subways , inviting attack and expertly dispatching his assailants with his peacemaker . <P> Personal revenge is still an acceptable motivation in an action movie . But Bronson is not looking for his wife 's murderers , though they are so manifestly weird that any reader of Dick Tracy would have a fair chance of finding them . No , he has become an abstract symbol of quick justice in a setting where every bit player is careful to complain that the courts are too slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a pop-cult hero , photographed against magazine posters acclaiming the salutary effect his work is having on the crime rate . Even the police do not want to make a martyr of the man who has redefined the term " good citizen . " When they catch him they merely deport him - to Chicago , which appears to offer him every opportunity to keep up the good work . <P> One used to believe that the self-parodying ineptness of films like this one was the antidote supplied by thoughtful producers to counteract their poisonous ideas . But the appalling example of Walking Tall is still before us . At least one preview audience actually cheered this urban variant on that rube farce . So let the matter be stated as forcefully as possible : Death Wish is a meretricious film-in its curious lack of feeling even for innocent victims of crime , in its hysterical exaggerations of an undeniable problem , and especially in its brazen endorsement of violence as a solution to violence .
