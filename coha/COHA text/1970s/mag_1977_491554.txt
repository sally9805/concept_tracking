Medical school faculty are n't in the habit of passing out compliments to medical writers in the lay press . So it was the highest praise for Berton Rouecith 's outstanding work as a medical reporter when , in 1961 , a pharmacology professor at a large midwestern medical school made Rouech ? ' s New Yorker article , " Ten Feet Tall , " required reading for his sophomore class . Roueche 's piece , the students were told , was a classic description of cortisone and ACTH . The side effects of the drugs , particularly their effects on the brain , were presented with superb insight . The article deals essentially with one side effectdrug-induced manic-depressive psychosis  --  that has chilling implications . Although it was not commonly known , the professor pointed out that President John F. Kennedy needed constant treatment with this drug . ( The puffiness often noted in the President 's face , he said , was part of the drug 's effect . ) The professor 's posture was apolitical . But he was deeply concerned , both as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , whose monumental responsibilities included control of the hot line to Russia , was taking a drug with such potentially dangerous and unpredictable side effects . Of all the wonderfully mettlesome drugs that crowd the contemporary medicine chest , two distinct but functionally related substances , called cortisone and ACTH , are by far the most vivacious . They are also the most peculiar , the most provocative , and the most dimly understood . Cortisone and ACTH are hormones . A hormone is a chemical mediator produced by the body and essential to maintaining its intricate equilibrium . The term derives from hormao , the Greek word for " excite , " or " stimulate . " The manufacture of hormones is among the several functions of the several ductless glands  --  the thyroid , the parathyroid , the pituitary , the adrenals , the gonads , the thymus , and the pancreatic islets of Langerhans  --  that form the endocrine system . Since 1902 , when the British physiologists Sir William Bayliss and Ernest Starling first demonstrated the role of an endocrine secretion in the digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied . Their range of influence has yet to be fully established , but it is known to embrace such factors as body size , mental tone , metabolic tempo , and sexual development and capacity . The development of cortisone and ACTH , like most scientific triumphs , was the work of several variously gifted hands . Cortisone came first . Its discovery was charted in 1930 , when investigators at Princeton , Ohio State University , and elsewhere demonstrated for the first time that adrenal cortical extracts prepared from animal glands possessed definite hormone powers . Five years later , it was isolated , also from animal glands , by Tadeus Reichstein , a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Basel , and Edward C. Kendall , a biochemist on the staff of the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research . A test devised shortly thereafter by a Mayo physiologist showed it to be biologically active . ACTH was isolated in 1943 . A biochemist named Choh Hao Li and some colleagues of his at the University of California are among those prominently associated with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with pig pituitaries , managed to produce a small amount of ACTH in 1946 , but several more years passed before it was available in even experimental quantities . By then , cortisone had been mastered . In 1948 , after six years of hard labor , Lewis H. Sarett , a chemist in the employ of Merck &; Company , evolved a synthesis that made it possible to produce cortisone commercially . The number of diseases upon which it has been reported to have at least some analgesic impact now approaches the galaxial . They include acute iritis , Addison 's disease , asthma , choroiditis , Cushing 's syndrome , dermatomyositis , erythroblastosis fetalis , gout , hay fever , Hodgkin 's disease , lupus erythematosus , lymphatic leukemia , myasthenia gravis , pemphigus , periarteritis nodosa , ivy poisoning , retinitis pigmentosa , rheumatic fever , scleroderma , spondylitis , Still 's disease , tetanus , ulcerative colitis , uveitis , vernal conjunctivitis , and Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome . It has also been found to be helpful in the treatment of shock , burns , and fractures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalisa baldness of possibly metabolic origin  --  to stimulate the regrowth of hair . Dazzled by this evidence of vigor and versatility , many investigators have come to consider cortisone almost a panacea . So , even more enthusiastically , have many more physicians . There is , however , in both these groups a core of stubborn dissenters . Their opposition to the popular view is only distantly rooted in doubt . It is prompted chiefly by discretion . They do not question the potency of cortisone . What they question is its safety . Hormone therapy , they point out , is still largely an empirical science . Just how cortisone achieves its impressive results has yet to be adequately explained . They therefore feel that until its mechanisms are more clearly illuminated , and the nature of its long-range , or cumulative , effects determined , the general use of so formidable a substance is more than a little rash . It has the power to revive a vanquished infection , it can excite a latent one to manifest itself , and , in the opinion of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonists certain normally innocuous viruses . It can also unhinge the mind . Mental derangements unequivocally attributable to cortisone have been reported by hundreds of clinicians . In many cases , these disturbances simulate with absolute fidelity the syndromes classically characteristic of paranoia , schizophrenia , and manic-depressive psychosis . To this , Henry J.L. Marriott , professor of medicine at the University of Maryland , has added , " We are dabbling in the unknown with dangerously potent tools . " The ugly side of cortisone does not , of course , completely contraindicate its use . It merely suggests its reservation for crises of intolerable pain or peril . Even the wariest clinicians concede that cortisone has a place , and a triumphant one , in modern chemotherapy . The relief it can bring to the racked and hobbled victims of rheumatoid arthritis would alone compel its inclusion . There are several other , though less prominent , diseases against which it is even more providentially effective . One of these , as a New York City schoolteacher I 'll call Robert Laurence can readily testify , is periarteritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Laurence would now be either bedfast and dying or dead , for until the advent of hormone therapy , periarteritis nodosa , a destructive inflammation of the arteries , was almost always briskly fatal . His escape was accomplished , however , at a truly hair-raising price . Laurence teaches history and English at a day school for boys . He is married and has a son of eleven and lives in a frame and stucco house in the Forest Hills section of Queens . He is a robust man of medium height , with brown eyes and a sandy crew cut , and he had just turned thirty-eight when he became acquainted with cortisone . That was on the morning of January 23,1954 , in a hospital I 'll call Whitestone Memorial . He had then been sick for more than a month and in the hospital for almost a week , but the nature of his trouble had finally been firmly established only the day before . Even at that , he was lucky . Periarteritis nodosa , though reasonably easy to diagnose if suspected , so closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eludes recognition right up to the autopsy table . He was also fortunate in his immediate reaction to cortisone . The amount prescribed by his doctor  --  Prince , I 'll call him  --  was a hundred and fifty milligrams a day , and the effects of this treatment were prompt , positive , and wholesome . Within a week , Laurence was up and about , restlessly prowling the ward , all symptoms and signs of inflammation vanished . His disease , if not uprooted , had at least been checked and was now safely under control . On Monday , February 1 , he was found fit to resume a normal life , and discharged from the hospital by his doctor . As Laurence recalls , " I had n't felt so good in years . I do n't mean just physically . It was more than that . I felt as bright as a button  --  capable of anything . It was really extraordinary . It was almost as though I 'd never been fully awake before . " I remember driving home from school and marveling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breakfast . It was just as well I did . I found my wife in bed . She 'd been fighting the flu for a couple of days and had finally given in . I got a chair and sat by the bed , and we talked for a while  --  mostly about dinner and the household chores . Then Bobby came in from playing , and when he came upstairs , he brought the afternoon paper . I picked it up and started turning the pages , and all of a sudden an advertisement caught my eye . It was a picture of a dress at Best &; Company . The price was thirty-five dollars , but it was a beauty . It was black jersey and very plain  --  just the sort of thing Nora looks wonderful in . I showed it to her and she thought so , too . It was lovely , she said . The rest is hard to explain . I mean now . At the time , it seemed perfectly natural . It was only what any intelligent man would do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my night table . I looked up the number and called the store and they had the dress in Nora 's size . I told them to send it out . " Mrs. Laurence 's attitude toward this act of impulse has also been altered by time . Its meaning now is painfully clear to her . It then seemed merely peculiar . " I guess I was n't really able to think . I had one of those headaches that leave you simply limp . The oddest part , though , was n't what he did . It was how he did it  --  his manner . He was so terribly polite to the people at the store . And so talkative . I thought he 'd never hang up . And when he did , it was almost worse . He jumped to his feet and came around to my side of the bed and started talking a mile a minute . It was something about people wasting all their time on trifles . I tried to listen and pay attention , but I just could n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Finally , something he said seemed to remind him that he was the cook that night . He looked at his watch and said he 'd better get started or he 'd be late for his appointment with Dr. Prince . " I remember hearing Bob go down the stairs . Then I must have dozed . The next thing I knew , Bob was standing by the bed with my dinner on a tray . Bob is quite a good cook and it was a lovely dinner  --  cold roast lamb , mashed potatoes , string beans , salad , hot biscuits , some kind of pudding , and coffee . But , good heavens ! Food was about the last thing in the world I wanted . Particu-larly that kind . So I said so . It never occurred to me that Bob would n't understand . Well , he practically jumped down my throat . Nonsense , he said . I had to eat . Everybody had to eat . How did I expect to keep up my strength if I did n't eat ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me sick . ' Do n't be silly , ' he said . ' Eat your dinner . ' It was fantastic , but I was simply too baffled to argue . I managed to swallow a few bites . Then I had an idea . I asked him to get me something  --  I 've forgotten what  --  and while he was out of the room , I scraped the rest of the food into part of the paper and bundled it up and hid it under the covers . It seems so ridiculous now , so childish ? and also so sad . Because it worked . Bob took the tray away without a single question . He was perfectly satisfied . And so was I. In spite of everything , all I really felt was relief . My only problem was staying awake until Bob left for his appointment . As soon as he did , I slipped downstairs and dumped the evidence in the garbage can . Then I crawled back to bed . " I did n't hear Bob come in . He was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , before I even knew he was home . What woke me up was his fidgeting . It was the doctor . Dr. Prince had increased his cortisone  --  for the second time , I learned . The dose was now two hundred and fifty milligrams a day . This time , Bob had insisted on finding out why . Bob was doing fine , the doctor said , but it was important at this stage to make certain that the inflammation remained completely smothered . I think that 's how he put it . Also , I believe , it had something to do with determining Bob 's maximum tolerance to cortisone . I suppose I was a little surprised at the increase . However , I could n't see that it was anything to get alarmed about . As a matter of fact , the reasons that Dr. Prince had given sounded very sensible to me . But they did n't to Bob . More cortisone simply meant that he was n't getting well . The doctor was only trying to humor him . He was probably getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so frightened  --  not even at the very beginning of his illness . He kept tossing and turning , though , and finally I suggested that he spend the rest of the night in the guest room . I thought he might sleep better in a bed by himself . He did n't want to , but I was firm . It seemed to me I had just dropped off when I heard my name . It was Bob . He was bending over me , and he was crying . I mean literally . There were tears rolling down his cheeks . He did n't like it in the guest room . It was too lonesome . He missed me and needed me . Would n't I please let him stay ? It was pathetic . I could n't bear to see him so upset . So I said all right . What else could I do ? " It was nearly eleven o'clock when I woke up the next morning . Last night might never have happened . It seemed to have vanished from his mind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke . He was absolutely bursting with high spirits . When he leaned down for a kiss , he gave me a hug that almost broke my back . But he was as restless as ever . He perched on the bed . Then he moved over to a chair . A minute later , right in the middle of a sentence , he jumped up and started pacing . Suddenly , he let out a kind of hurrah . He was standing on the far side of the bed with the paper in his hand . ' Listen to this ! ' he said , and started reading . But he did n't have to tell me . I caught a glimpse of B. Altman and Men 's Suits and Twenty Percent Off , and that was enough . My heart sank . I watched him pick up the phone and dial the number . It was just like the day before . Except he was even more polite . It took him forever to get to the point . But when he finally did , he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 . Charge and send . There was a pause . Well , what did they have in his size that was nice ? He frowned . He did n't think he 'd ever seen a brown slash weave . He nodded . But did n't the red and green make it rather loud ? No ? Then send it out . And while they were at it , if they saw anything else that might appeal to him  --  another suit , or maybe a topcoat  --  send that along , too . I just lay there and stared . I was speechless . It was n't that I begrudged him a new suit , or even a topcoat . But , good heavens  --  what in the world had come over him ! " But Bob was completely oblivious . He hung up with a flourish and came striding around the bed He lighted hispipe and rubbed his hands and cleared his throat . He asked me if I realized the significance of what he had just done . It was n't a question , though . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and it illuminated a whole philosophy . Our life lacked order , and we needed a new sense of proportion . We had become incapable of distinguishing between the important and the trivial . Our one most vital possession was time , and we squandered it like drunken sailors . When it was necessary to buy something  --  a dress , a suit , a piece of furniture  --  we thought nothing of running into Manhattan and spending an entire afternoon traipsing from store to store . It was shocking to think of the hours we wasted every year so foolishly , and so needlessly . But no more . From now on , we would do things differently . He waved a hand in the direction of the telephone . There was the answer . We were privileged to live in a day of instant communication . It was high time we took advantage of it . He felt that the experiment he had conducted this afternoon sufficiently proved his point . It was possible for an intelligent man to select  --  comfortably , easily , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere matter of minutes . " Bob must have talked for a solid hour . He probably would n't have stopped even then if Bobby had n't come in and asked about dinner . " I did n't see Bob again until after dinner  --  until after he 'd done the dishes , in fact . He walked in and sat down and kicked off his shoes , and I remember thinking that he seemed almost relaxed . Bobby was watching television , he said . As for himself , he was going to take a bath . I reminded him that he had just washed the dishes and there would n't be much hot water left . He 'd better wait a little while and give the boiler a chance to recover . He smiled , and said that was n't the point . He wanted to take a bath . He wanted to take it now . Was it my impression that he was the kind of man who could be dictated to by a machine ? If there was no hot water , he would bathe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February was the best time for a cold bath . He gave me a surprised look . No ? Why not ? Water was water . Temperature was a mere detail . It meant nothing . It did in his condition , I said . A cold bath might do him a great deal of harm . If he must bathe now , I said , I 'd get up and go downstairs and heat some water on the stove . I never dreamed he 'd let me . But he simply shrugged and said all right , go ahead . For a moment , I just felt numb . And then I knew . I could n't avoid it any longer . I 'd been able to rationalize the dress and the suit and the tears and the wild , crazy talk . But this was different . This was n't Bob . There was no resemblance whatever . This was a man I 'd never seen before . Something had happened to Bob  --  something terrible . I let him help me out of bed and stand me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . He did n't even offer to come with me . " Laurence has no clear recollection of that tyrannical bath . He only remembers having a sense of power and glory . Exaltation had become his natural state . Every impulse seemed to quicken it . On Wednesday , driving home from school , he passed a plumbing and heating establishment . The cogs of memory and acquisitiveness meshed . He pulled up and went in , and ordered a new capacious , rapid-recovery hot-water heater and boiler . " I knew I 'd done an extraordinary thing , " he says . " And yet it seemed so right .

When I finally did drop off , I hardly slept at all , and I was wide awake before it was even light . But I felt completely rested . I was bursting with strength and energy . It was as though I 'd reached a new level of existence . Sleep did n't seem to matter anymore . A few minutes was as good as an hour . My only real necessity was food .

By the time I got to school , I was keyed to concert pitch . I felt ten feet tall " Laurence was not alone in this alpine impression of himself . It soon was shared by both his wife and his son . " Thursday was my first day out of bed , so I was still working when Bob got home , " Mrs. Laurence says . " I was cleaning the living room . Everything had gone to pieces while I was sick .

He looked enormous . He really did look ten feet tall . Bobby said the same thing later on . He seemed to fill the room . It was his manner , I think , and the way he held himself . And his voice . That was part of it . The instant he saw me , he started talking , and I 've never heard such colossal self-assurance . Such conviction . It was something about something at the school . A new era was about to dawn . He had discovered a new technique that would revolutionize the present methods of teaching . It would revolutionize the whole of American education . He stood on the threshold of a new career . His life was no longer aimless . He had a mission . I did my best to listen and pay attention . It made a kind of sense at times . Only he talked so fast . He was almost incoherent . He stormed up and down the room , and his ideas got wilder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also applied to domestic life . Out home was to be run on the same basis . The keynote was discipline . He loved me , he said . He bounded over and threw his arms around me . And he loved Bobby . HE loved us both with all his heart . But he was our leader . He was in command . From now on , our home would be run on a basis of strict paternal control . There would be no more preoccupation with trifles . The day of laxity and foolishness had passed . Discipline was the new order . He followed me into the dining room . Did I understand ? He pounded on the table . There had to be discipline . It was the only way to happiness .

If so , it must be that . There was n't any other explanation . 1 could n't believe that Bob had actually lost his mind . But that was n't really much help . It did n't tell me what to do . My brain went around and around and around . I finally told myself that this was pointless . Dr. Prince knew what he was doing . He was a specialist  --  one of the best . The sensible thing to do was keep busy and try not to worry .

As I started back up , I heard somebody in the kitchen . I thought it was Bobby , but it was n't . It was Bob . He was standing in the middle of the room with the iron in his hand , and he was livid . He turned on me like a tiger . Just what did I think I was doing ? Had n't he made it clear that there would be no more preoccupation with trifles in this family ? Did 1 think he would permit his wife to drudge her life away at an ironing board ? I was not a menial . I was his wife , and he expected me to conduct myself as such . He slammed down the iron . I was to get all this paraphernalia out of his sight at once . Immediately .

I suggested that at least I go ahead and iron the shirts that I had already washed . After all , I said , he had to have something to wear while the rest were at the laundry . That was as far as I got . He blew up . He began to yell that he would n't live like this . He refused to complicate his life with all these petty problems . He did n't give a hoot about laundries or anything else . He could n't be bothered . From now on , he 'd buy a new shirt every morning and throw it away at night . That was the law . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beet-red and he was shaking like a leaf . I disconnected the iron and folded up the ironing board and put them back in the closet . 1 was n't humoring him . It was n't like Tuesday night . He meant exactly what he said . It was an order . " I spent the next day catching up on my work . After dinner , Bobby helped me with the dishes , and then we played a game of Scrabble . We were looking at television when Bob got home . He suddenly stopped deadin his tracks . He was staring at the television set as though he had never seen it before in his life . So this was how his family spent their time , he said . His voice was like ice . We had a house full of books . We had a phonograph and a library of the world 's greatest music . But , apparently , we were just like all the rest of the country . He gave a howl that almost froze my blood . No wonder we could n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dived across the room and shut the program off . Then he backed away a step and doubled up his fist . Maybe this would bring us to our senses . He 'd show us what he thought of television . He was going to take his fist and smash that screen to pieces . He would have , too . It was n't just a threat . But Bobby moved first . He slid out of his chair and ran over to the desk and pulled open the drawer where we keep the telephone book . Bob heard him , and whirled around . And what was he up to ? Bobby was white as death , but he told him . He said he was looking up Dr. Prince 's number . He thought he ought to be here . Indeed , Bob said . He pointed his finger at the sofa . Bobby had exactly one second to get over there and sit down and be quiet . He was n't to move a muscle . Neither was I. We were to sit there and nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might put his fist through that screen . He might decide to kick the whole set apart . He might even take a knife and cut off one of his fingers and throw it in the wastebasket . But we were to just sit there . Was that clear ? " I do n't know what came over me . It was n't courage . I was still completely terrified , but something had broken the spell . It must have been seeing Bobby try to call the doctor . Whatever it was , it gave me the strength to get to my feet and tell Bob what I thought . I told him this had gone on long enough . We knew he was sick , but that was no excuse . I would n't stand for it . Besides , it was almost eleven o'clock . Bobby should have been in bed an hour ago , and I refused to keep him up another min-ute . Bob did n't say a word . He just looked startled . I moved fast . It was either that or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we were out of the room and up the stairs before Bob could even blink . He must have been absolutely stun-ned . While Bobby was getting un-dressed , I stood at the door and lis-tened . There was n't a sound . He was still downstairs , and that gave me an idea . We could n't go on like this . I had to talk to the doctor , and now was my chance . I got Bobby settled and calm enough to close his eyes and relax , and then I slipped down the hall to our bedroom . But I 'd waited too long , or maybe Bob heard me . Our bedroom is right above the living room . I had only dialed the number when I heard him racing up the stairs . The next thing I heard was Dr. Prince 's voice . By some miracle , Continued on page 120 continued from pa4e 112 he answered the phone himself . I managed to say hello and give him my name .

For one horrible moment , it crossed my mind that it might not be me he was thinking about at all . It might be Bobby . And then the phone rang . I looked at Bob . He sort of shrugged . I waited , but that was all . So 1 picked up the receiver and said hello . It was Dr. Prince . We seemed to have been cut off , he said . He added that I had sounded a bit disturbed . Was something wrong ? I said yes . I did n't dare say any more than that . He hoped Bob was n't sick ? I said no , not exact ? ly  --  and prayed that he would understand . He did  --  in a way . So that was it , he said . Not acting like himself . eh ? I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I said yes . Well , cortisone could do that , he said . Especially in the amount that Bob had been getting . It was nothing to worry about , of course , but still  --  Suppose I brought him in tomorrow for a check . I said I 'd try to . Meanwhile , Dr. Prince said . if I had such a thing as a sedative , that would calm him down very nicely . I said I thought we had some Lumina ! . Fine , he said . Just the thing  --  and hung up . I could have screamed . " I wo n't go into the next four hours . They were a living nightmare . Bob stormed all over the place . He raged and ranted . He cried . At one point , he even took a bath . He apologized a thousand times . I was terrified . I was furious . I would have run out of the house and left him , if it had n't been for Bobby . We ended up at four o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lumina ' . There was only one capsule in the bottle , and he had been trying his best for half an hour to knock it out of my hand . He did n't want to go to sleep , he said . He was never going to sleep again . Sleep was a waste of time . Then he got the idea I was trying to poison him . He did n't trust me , he said , and if I did n't leave him alone , he would tear off his clothes and run out in the street naked . That was one threat . I 've forgotten the others . But at last he gave in . I brought him a glass of water , and he took the capsule and put it in his mouth . He kept it there just long enough for me to relax . Then he reared back , and spat it clear across the room . I remember scrambling after it . I was practically hysterical , but . I knew it was the only hope I had . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , damp and dirty , under the bureau , and brought it back . I was so wild I must have frightened him . He swallowed it  --  dirt and all . " Bob 's appointment with Dr. Prince was for two o'clock Saturday afternoon . It was obvious that hewas n't eager to go , but he went . I think he remembered enough about the night before to realize that he had behaved very badly . During the drive downtown , he hardly said a word . He seemed completely subdued . But I knew that mood too well . I was n't deceived , and I prayed that Dr. Prince would n't be . It did n't seem to me he was , but it was hard to tell . He asked Bob some questions about his general condition and he made some tests , and that was about ali . There were only two encouraging things . One was just after we sat down . lie asked Bob how he was feeling . Bob closed his eyes and smiled . ' I 'm as contented as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , Dr. Prince said , but he glanced at me and sort of frowned . The other thing was really two . He gave Bob half a grain of phenobarbital and an envelope of phenobarbital capsules . He was to take one every three or four hours until further notice . And he reduced his cortisone from two hundred and fifty to a hundred and fifty milligrams . Bob left the office still pretty much subdued . We got in the car and started home , and he began to tell me how sorry he was about last night . He was ashamed of himself . He did n't know what had come over him . It would n't happen again . I sat and listened . I was almost tempted to believe him . " We were almost home when he suddenly let out a yell . He jammed on the brakes and started pounding the wheel . I was the one who ought to be ashamed , he said . I never thought of anybody but myself . Maybe I thought he had n't noticed , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He understood everything now . I did n't care what happened to him . I was too self-centered . The car behind us started blowing its horn . People were turning around and craning their necks and grinning . It was so awful I wanted to die . I begged him to be sensible . I told him it was n't true . I said I had n't yawned or , if I had , it did n't mean what he thought .. I was n't any of those Dr. Prince had n't been deceived by Laurence 's professed serenity . He had recognized that his patient was suffering from a cortisone-induced manic-depressive psychosis , and he acted with reasonable dispatch . The following afternoon , Laurence was readmitted to the hospital . and the program of cortisone treatment was suspended . He remained there this time for a week . On Wednesday morning , he requested a pen and some paper from a nurse , and in thirty minutes jotted down a record of his experiences , as he recalled them , during the past three weeks . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still am , " he wrote , in part . " Although I have been off the drug since last Sunday  --  today is Wednesday , February 17 , 1959 ? there is still evidence of strange , yet wonderful things . I find that when I begin to talk , I talk incessantly . On Sunday , as soon as I got in bed , a complete sense of well-being overcame me. 1 developed complete and utter faith in the doctor and in the hospital staff . I feel a kind of floating sensation . Physically , I seem strong beyond imagination . For the first three days , I experienced an insatiable hunger  --  as though I could eat a hundred meals at each serving  --  and yet I was able to control the urge to eat . Now I am able to wait for meals and do not seem to be hungry between meals . Mentally , I am as sharp as the proverbial tack . Emotionally , I still exhibit a tendency to become annoyed by the petty behavior of the people around me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , I know nothing about medicine and I can not discern what the doctor sees when he is examining me , but I appear to be healing . In fact , as crazy as it may seem , there are times when I seem to feel the healing process . " On Sunday , February 21 , at Dr. Prince 's suggestion , Laurence was released from the hospital for a spell of rest at home . About three weeks later , on March 12 , some symptoms of periarteritis nodosa having reappeared , his doctor ordered him back to the hospital for what turned out to be a stay of about a month . Hormone therapy was resumed on a trial-and-error basis , and this led to the substitution of ACTH for cortisone . By the time Laurence was discharged from the hospital , forty units of ACTH , taken every four days , had been established as the optimum course . That was on April 10 , 1959 . He has been comfortably free ever since of any symptoms of either periarteritis nodosa or manic-depressive psychosis. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
