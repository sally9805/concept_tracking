American Scene <P> Lexington , Mass. , is nearly country , nearly rich and near enough to Boston to attract a more or less upwardly mobile mix of residents : native Yankees , middle-management families from companies such as Raytheon and Polaroid , intellectuals from M.I.T. and Harvard . " You have the impression that everyone in Lexington has a fireplace in his bedroom , " says one high school senior . The corollary illusion is that every house contains a happy , intact family . Yet an estimated 30% ( no one knows for sure ) of the students in Lexington 's school system have suffered the effects of divorce . Despite the fact that divorce is now regarded as part of the American way of life , they feel they are aliens in their own culture . <P> On this wet afternoon , 16 students , ten to twelve years of age , are sitting in a circle at the Bridge Elementary School . They are all children of divorce . " It 's just called a support group , " says Frank Nelligan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a week . Today one question before the group is whether a film on divorce that it has just seen should be shown to children whose parents are not divorced . <P> A girl says , " The kids whose parents are together will just say , ' Nah , my parents are n't like that . ' Those kids are n't the kind who will listen . They will just tease and look at you funny . " A boy earnestly explains : " Sometimes you are too scared to tell your friends . You might be ashamed . " " Ashamed ? " a counselor asks . A girl called Flora ( the names of students are fictitious ) stares at the floor and says , " Sometimes they say they are just going on a trip . I was upset . They lied . " The point of this support group , the real usefulness of a school 's becoming involved , is made clear when the counselor asks if there are any adults the kids feel they can talk to . He is answered by silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share her experience with divorce . She is a member of a group-three years old and mostly girls , so far-at Lexington Senior High1 School . There are many services for divorced parents now , but so far only some two dozen such groups throughout the country for kids . The one in Lexington is known as the Divorced Kids Group , a name with more zest than , say , Children of Broken Homes Group , but not entirely satisfactory . Why should children define themselves by their parents ' behavior ? Howard Schofield , the counselor who started the group , feels the children 's acknowledgment of their predicament is the first step toward feeling less helpless about it . Says Helen : " After all , the divorce is as much ours as our parents ' . "
