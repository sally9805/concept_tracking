There was standing room only at Harvard 's Lowell Lecture Hall as more than 1,200 eager students crowded in for the opening of one of the hottest courses on campus . Human Sexuality 101 ? Analytical Communal Living 202 ? Mysticism 303 ? Hardly . It was Economics 10 , the standard survey course for beginners . Enrollment in the course is up 43% from last fall , and nearly one in every five Harvard undergrads is taking it . The Harvard campus is not alone . At Columbia and Barnard , at Atlanta 's black Morehouse College and the patrician University of Virginia , at universities all across the U.S. , that once-dismal mainstay economics is suddenly the course to take . <P> Why ? Answers Elisabeth Allison , who is " head section person " ( teacher ) for Harvard 's EC 10 : " When the economy is in bad shape , people are interested-and , boy , are they ever interested ! " At the University of California at Berkeley , where enrollment in undergraduate economics courses is up 15% to 20% , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases have brought home to everyone the need to understand inflation . " Smith College is another school trying to make economics understandable . The result : This year , one in every two Smithies is or has been enrolled in the basic course . <P> Some professors give still another reason for the boom . Dr. Charles Howe of the University of Colorado says that students are more and more interested in taking courses that prepare them for a job . While graduate economics courses in natural-resources management and public finance have risen in popularity , enrollment in Colorado 's basic course in economic principles has almost doubled since last year , to 1,400 students . <P> The trend may be part of a general shift away from the " soft , " theoretical , social sciences of the heady ' 60s , especially sociology and anthropology , and back to the " hard " disciplines . The economics courses not only provide basic preparation for many careers , but also can be specifically applied ( professors willing ) to the nation 's fundamental problems . For example , Urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates basic theory to such current issues as urban renewal , property taxes and public-school funding . <P> Indeed , the study of economics is rapidly reaching downward into lower schools . The Economics Education Council of Massachusetts , in which several universities participate , offers twelve new seminars in economics for elementary-school teachers-who report that their pupils are intensely interested . Says Boston University Professor Kenneth Sheldon : " My elementary school teachers are having remarkable success bringing the basics of economics to their students . Grade-schoolers really want to know how this system operates . " And Assistant Professor Norman Ellenberg of California State University , Los Angeles has started an economics education program for children in the Los Angeles city school system-beginning in kindergarten .
