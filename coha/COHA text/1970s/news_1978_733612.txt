txt Letters : Cars on Beach Stir the Outer Banks JANET HELLERJ . GORDON RUBINNANCY LOGANSHELLEY LAZARJAMES S. WALKERPAUL M. DOU .. Letters : Cars on Beach Stir the Outer Banks To the Editor : After reading the article " In and Around Nags Head " ( Travel Section , April 9 ) , my children and I recently went down for a visit and were appalled to see literally hundreds of motor vehicles parked by the edge of the water in those areas where fishing is allowed . Obviously the local authorities are not opposed to this visual desecration of the beaches . True , there are areas set aside as wildlife preserves in North Carolina 's Outer Banks and they 're lovely , but they only serve to emphasize the horror of the metal locusts squatting by the seaside so that lazy fishermen wo n't have to walk in from the road . We shall never return as long as this travesty persists . JANET HELLER Baltimore Mrs. Heller opens a real can of worms . A controversy of great magnitude is raging over the vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the furor stems from National Park Service efforts to restrict the use of off-road vehicles in certain areas of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore , a move that has met with strong opposition from fishermen . The National Seashore , which stretches for 70 miles along the Outer Banks , includes some of the best surf fishing in the United States and attracts tens of thousands of fishermen annually . According to the Park Service , 20 percent of these anglers drive their vehicles onto the beaches instead of leaving them in the parking lots . The role of the fishermen is such that the Park Service has been leery of acting precipitately for fear of causing economic hardship in the area . In light of this , no final ruling is expected for at least another year . Meantime , the fishermen continue to motor on the beach in four-wheel-drive vehicles and have organized under a banner reading " Outer Banks Preseivation Association . " ? Ed . ' Opus 40 To the Editor : Regarding the article by Harold Faber , " A Spring Shunpike Tour Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your readers may be interested in knowing that this year for the first time , Opus 40 , the outdoor environmental stone sculpture created by Harvey Fite , will be open to the public . Out of an abandoned quarry near Woodstock , N.Y. , Mr. Fite created his masterwork  --  a six-acre environmental sculpture which ranks among the most awesomely beautiful works of art America has produced . It was selected by the Hirshhorn Museum of the Smithsonian Institution for its " Probing the Earth " exhibition this past fall . Work on the project began in 1990 and continued uninterrupted for the next 37 years . With Mr. Fite 's death , the work is now complete . The sculpture is located about 10 minutes from Saugerties on the road to Woodstock . Those desiring to visit the site can do so by calling to q14-246-3400 . J. GORDON RUBIN Mount Marion , N.Y . To the Editor : In the article on the Hudson shunpik ing tour , it states that the " Franklin D. Roosevelt Home and Museum at Hydi Park is open every day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a year the admission to ! those 16 years and older has been $1.50. with senior citizens and those under If : admitted free . NANCY LOGAN Poughkeepsie , N:Y . A spokesman at Hyde Park points out that $1.50 price covers admission to three facilities  --  the adjacent Vanderbilt National Historic Site , the Franklin D. Roosevelt Home and the F.D.R. Library and Museum . To the Editor : An added bit of information about the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Home and Museum in Hyde Park : I was told by a guide that one may picnic anywhere on the grounds . My party chose the orchard area ( shady trees , freshly cut grass , budding flowers ) , spread our blanket , unpacked our fried chicken and wine and relaxed . SHELLE ) LA/.AP Brooklyn Belgrade To the Editor : David Andelman 's story , " What ' : , Doing in Belgrade " ( Travel Section , April 23 ) , was a fine overview , but the following comments are in order : 1 . I have stayed at the Hotel Moskva a couple of dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the staff is that they are . extremely helpful , providing a number of services not ordinarily expected from a hotel  --  locating cars and drivers , getting transportation reservations and tickets , effecting // minor repairs to clothing , even phoning around Belgrade to transmit urgent messages to guests . 2 . Yugoslav wines are indeed firstrate and largely unknown to Americans , but to Mr. Andelman 's whites I would add Posip , Semijon , Beli Burgundac and Kostelet ; the fine reds include Postup , Barbera , Refosk , Merlot and Kratosija . There are also some outstanding dry ros  --  s . Incidentally , in every restaurant I have been in there is available inexpensive carafe wine of very good quality . JAMES S. WALKER New York Dutch Treat To the Editor : In Suzanne Donner 's Notes Column ( Travel Section , April 23 ) , the lead paragraph tells of Dutch tourism officials promoting the reality of the cyclist 's dream of flat terrain in the Netherlands . Flat it is . But what makes the windmills turn can make it all uphill if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ago a companion and I made a round trip between two places in the Netherlands that required six hours of strenuous work going and two hours of almost effortless pedaling coming back . But whichever way the wind blows or however you get about , The Netherlands may be the friendliest and nicest country to visit in Europe . That 's the way it has been for me . PAUL M. DOUGLAS Princeton , N.J. Alligator Sandwiches To the Editor : The article by David Bird , " By Canoe in the Florida Everglades " ( Travel Section , April 30 ) , was read with great interest by myself , my 14-year-old son and two other companions who completed a similar camping expedition last April . Our canoe trip , unlike author Bird 's , originated at Flamingo , Fla. , the southernmost extremity of the Florida peninsula . It involved a passage through the Hell 's Bay Canoe Trail to the Lard Can Camp Site in the eastern sector of Whitewater Bay . This part of the Everglades is noted for its virgin wilderness . Again , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we anticipated nocturnal incursions and vandalism by raccoons and other furry creatures . We strung a hammock between two trees high above ground and stowed all our groceries , garbage , cooking utensils and other gear except for three uneaten ham and cheese sandwiches that we tossed into the water . After a good dinner of pork chops and beans cooked over a campfire , we were about to retire to our tent for the night when we heard a disturbance in the water . A flashlight beam revealed four sets of incandescent red eyes and one set of large jaws latching onto a ham and cheese sandwich ( on white bread with mustard ) . The alligator proceeded to systemati // cally finish off the remaining sandwiches while his colleagues looked or . impassively . We campers who had provided for security against incursion by furry creatures suddenly realized that the casual disposition of a few sandwiches might induce a campsite incursion by wildlife that would have put a real damper on what is truly a rewarding and adventuresome travel experiDANIEL G. SPAETH ence . Rye , N.Y . Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Travel Section , April 2 ) , inquiring as to whether anyone knew if the Askaniya-Nova nature preserve in the Soviet Union was ? open to the public , Professor J. Wahrman of the Department of Genetics , The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , writes : " Members of the First International Theriological Congress , Moscow , June 6-12 , 1974 , were invited to visit the Askaniya-Nova Reservation in the framework of two different post-congress tours . A special tour to Askaniya-Nova was also arranged following the 12th International Botanical Congress , Leningrad , July 3-10 , 1975 . Unfortunately , I can not report to you on the reservation , as I took part in other excursions . It seems , however , that that the place is open to visits of interested parties . " This still leaves unresolved the question of whether ordinary tourists from abroad , as well as scientists , visit the Askaniva-Nova site . ALBERT PARRY Cos Cob , Conn . Campus Vacations To the Editor : In " Campus Vacations : For Body and Mind " ( Travel Section , April 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being in Champagne . Champagne , as one happily recalls , is a region in France notable for the bubbly . The small city whose name the writer was reaching for is Champaign . GERALD CARSON Millerton , N.Y . In England , Now To The Editor : When . I read about the " Live England " venture ( Travel Section , Jan. 22 ) , I was hesitant but wrote to Richard Bray in Bournemouth ( at 146 Alma Road , Charminster BH9-1AJ , Dorset ) for information on joining his organization as a guest . To sum up , I was pleasantly surprised with the prompt reply and thereupon made a firm reservation . The Brays are charming , relaxed British people who follow through on all their printed promises . But they did not tell me in advance how great the food was , how informative and pleasant the excursions and how relaxed the entire stay would be . None of that business of being up at the crack of dawn to join a busload of people  --  not anything of that sort . SELMA BLICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
