INTERNECINE warfare has always been a brutal fact of Mafia life . Struggles for power by violent men naturally beget violence . Further , the Cosa Nostra has traditionally been divided between the " Mustache Petes , " as the powerful old Sicilian-born kingpins were contemptuously called , and the young American-born racketeers who did the dirty work for change and a pat on the head . <P> - <P> The Masseria-Maranzano war , or Castellammarese war , was one of the first great Mob battles , spanning the early Cosa Nostra days of 1930-31 . For all of Al Capone 's notoriety , the most powerful underworld leader then was Giuseppe ( " Joe the Boss " ) Masseria , who was flanked by such young up-and-comers as " Lucky " Luciano , Vito Genovese and Frank Costello . Masseria was determined to consolidate his position by eliminating his chief rival , Salvatore Maranzano , and his clannish Castellammerese ( men from the Sicilian town of Castellammare del Golfo ) , including " Joe Bananas " Bonanno and Joseph Profaci in Brooklyn and Joseph Aiello in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own leaders , Gaetano Reina , who ran New York City 's profitable ice concession . Reina 's men joined forces with Maranzano , and after a few skirmishes , Masseria 's lieutenants realized that they were hopelessly outnumbered . Five of them secretly surrendered to Maranzano and agreed to execute Masseria in return for profit-and their lives . Three of Masseria 's henchmen later murdered him in a Coney Island restaurant . <P> Maranzano gathered some 500 troops and declared a peace . It did not last long . On Sept. 11 , 1931 , five men walked into Maranzano 's Park Avenue office , claimed they were detectives and had everyone in the outer office line up against the wall . Then two of the " detectives " burst into the inner office , shot Maranzano and cut his throat . Within 48 hours , at least 40 of Maranzano 's confederates , most of them experienced hands from the old country , were slain in various parts of the country . <P> All of the deaths , including those of Masseria and Maranzano , were engineered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Commission " to ensure that the brotherhood would never again suffer from one-man rule by a capo di tutti capi-boss of all bosses . <P> <P> After Luciano 's exile in 1946 , Vito Genovese and Frank Costello emerged as two of the Mob 's most formidable powers , and subsequently squared off . Genovese had leadership of a family , but wanted to be nothing less than what Luciano had sought to abolish : the boss of all bosses . In 1951 he went after one of Costello 's top men , Willie Moretti . Sitting in a Greenwich Village restaurant one night with Joseph Valachi and several other of his men , Genovese said ( according to Valachi ) : " Willie has got to be hit because he is not well . He has lost his mind , and that is the way life is . If tomorrow I go wrong , I would want to be hit so as not to bring harm to this thing of ours . " Hence Moretti 's death ( his body was found in a Cliffside Park , N.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known in mob circles as a " mercy killing . " <P>
