The lustiest cheers at the vast military parade marking Israel 's 25th anniversary in Jerusalem last May were neither for tanks and paratroopers passing the reviewing stand nor Phantoms whooshing overhead . Instead , the crowds cheered loudest for a slight , aging , white-thatched man being helped to a seat of honor among the dignitaries . He was David Ben-Gurion , Israel 's longtime leader , first Prime Minister and , in a sense , its George Washington . Out of the Prime Minister 's office for ten years and in complete retirement for three , Ben-Gurion , in that appearance , gave Israelis a fitting chance to acclaim his role in the birth , growth and maturity of their country . <P> As it turned out , the independence-day parade was their last chance . Even then , Ben-Gurion 's health had begun to fail . Too feeble to stay at the Sde Boker kibbutz in the red-roofed bungalow he had occupied alone since Wife Paula 's death five years before , he returned two months ago to his other home in Tel Aviv .

He was rushed to Tel Hashomer hospital , where he died last weekend at 87 . <P> A Jew First . Even though his political influence had waned , Ben-Gurion was mourned all over Israel . He was the realist and visionary who had dreamed of and worked for a Jewish state through half a century of Turkish , British and international rule in Palestine . He had suggested the name for the new country . He had carried out hard or unpopular decisions in the state 's early days and inevitably left on Israel the strength of his own personality . <P> It was quite a personality . Ben-Gurion 's moods covered the full range from stormy to stoical . He was at times arbitrary , vindictive and magnanimous . He had a disarming smile , but the deep-set brown eyes under the delta-like shock of white hair always burned . He believed in direct answers to direct questions , and his allegiance was unquestioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " invariably said the man who came from a nonobservant family . <P> He was born David Gryn , and that was his name when he set out from Russia in 1906 and landed illegally at Jaffa to begin a new life as a Zionist pioneer . Once in Palestine , Gryn followed a practice of the early settlers and changed his name to Ben-Gurion , which in Hebrew means " Son of a Lion Cub . " The new arrival was anxious to work the land ( " That was the ideal life I wanted for myself , " he would recall . " I saw in that the renewal of the Jewish nation " ) . He settled in the Galilean village of Sejera and insisted in later years that farming there had been his greatest joy . Friends , however , said that he was a less than expert plowman because he spent most of his time reading and studying .
