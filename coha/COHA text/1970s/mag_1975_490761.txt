THE TALK OF THE TOWN Note 's and Comment WE were interested to read the other day that Richard Nixon is thinking about getting back into politics . Senator Barry Goldwater had just had Lunch with him , and reported that the former President might like to be a Republican " Party spokesman . " Goldwater thought it sounded like a good idea . " My mail shows there 's no lessening of interest in him within the Party , " he said " After all , he had millions who voted for him . " That same . day , we read that President Ford was asking Congress for a **28;4931;TOOLONG increase in American aid to South Vietnam . In Saigon , President Thieu was granting " exclusive " interviews to quite a few American newsmen and was telling them all that without the new aid the North Vietnamese might take over . Just a few weeks ago , of course , when Phuoc Binh , the capital of South Vietnam 's Phuoc Long Province , was falling , an American naval task force was discovered heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rumors that the United States was contemplating a more active role in the war . We 've been hearing it said that the people in Washington have n't come up with enough new ideas recently . But here are two : a new political career for Richard Nixon , and a new , expanded role for the United States in Vietnam . Mr. Nixon 's timing may be opportune . If the United States is getting back into the war , we ca n't think of a better man to lead the way . ? Grand Central TAsT week , a few days after Irving . e I Saypol , of the New York State Supreme Court , decided that Grand Central Terminal was no longer a New York City Landmark , and that the Penn Central Railroad and its building associate , UGP Properties , Ltd. , were now free to move the station underground and put up an office building on the site , we ducked into the newly refurbished and flourishing Grand Central Oyster Bar to think this thing out over a few bivalves . The station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start putting up another office building this year ? There 's a new one on Sixth Avenue not far from our office which has recently decided not to open its doors ; it will he cheaper to keep the building closed than to go ahead and provide heat , light , and water for the few tenants who have signed tip . But the Grand Central area the station and its surrounding hotels and clubs and shops  --  is the heart of Manhattan , and it needs to go on beating . We began muttering to ourself about how one of the major accomplishments this magazine could definitely la claim to in its several decades of existence was that in the late forties we managed to get the New York Central Railroad to stop playing Muzak and commercials in Grand Central Station . What , we groaned , could we do now ? " Well , you might ask me , " said the man on the next stool at the Oyster Bar . We looked around . By happy chance , he was Ernest M. Frimbo , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a man who remembers the second Grand Central Terminal , which was being demolished when I first arrived in New York , to make way for the present , third Grand Central Terminal . The first tune I walked into the concourse of iJL15 building  --  which I love very much -- would have been in 1914 , when I was coming down from Boston , where my family then lived , to go to school at Friends Academy in Washington . My father , who knew someone in the architectural firm that designed the station , was along , and he took me up to one of the offices high above the ceiling of the concourse , which were reached by a walkwa through the huge , seemingly solid glass wall on the south side of the concourse . Glass on each side of the walkway . It was an eerie experience , because volt looked up , and there right above you was the zodiac that adorns the ceiling of the great concourse of Grand Central  --  and in those days the zodiac was atwinkle with little electric-hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars are ever shining , and they arc eclipsed by the noonday sun of the huge Kodak display . And below you , on the walkway , sixty or eighty feet down , was the floor of the concou rse . And just this seemingly thin glass wall on either side . It was a thrill for a little hit of a boy , and I remember I held on to my father and took every step with great care . T felt that perhaps this was a trap , and when we reached the offices I asked if there was n't some other way of getting down out of the building . There was , of course . " Later , as a grown-up railroad buff , I was part of a group that had the use of one of these offices , at a nominal sum , for a little meeting place , through the courtesy of one of the last good presidents of the New York Central  --  F. F .. Williamson  --  when the New York Central was one of the classic railroads of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep railway records , show photographs , and entertain railway officials from abroad . And then , on a Sunday morning , it was a great event to go down the street to the old Murray Hill Hotel for breakfast with all the young bloods and their young ladies . " I 'd say that in a way we 're lucky to have had old Grand Central  --  I 'm already calling it old  --  as long as we have had it . Because a dozen years ago or so the New York Central , no longer a classic railroad , came up with a scheme for discontinuing service from Harmon , thirty-two miles north of here , into the city , on the ground that since people were accustomed to taking buses and taxicabs in from New York City 's airports , they should , uh , accept the privilege of taking a bus or a taxicab in from Harmon . If that scheme had gone through , there would n't have been a Grand Central Terminal to demolish today . Just as , with the Bicentennial coming up next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a visitors ' center and removing the passenger trains therefrom . The passenger trains to our nation 's capital will terminate nobody knows where  --  at a station somewhere near the visitors ' center for which no plans have yet been drawn . And that is supposed to happen next year . " The interesting thing is that Grand Central , if it is invited to remain with us , will be a very busy place in another couple of years . The Oyster Bar , as you can see , is already almost turning away customers , and , thanks to the bond issue passed by the voters of New York State last November , the night train to Buffalo , Cleveland , and Chicago is to he restored , and high-speed service to Albany and then west along the Mohawk Valley as far as Buffalo will be installed for the first time . " But you want to know how to save the station ? We talk about restoring the city , making it more playful . Here 's my scheme : restore Grand Central to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that used to run across Forty-second Street and down to Thirty-fourth Street , then over to the East River , restore the steam ferry across the East River to Long Island City , restore the Long Island Rail Road Pullman cars from Long Island City to Montauk Point , restore the Forty-second Street trolley cars over to the old West Shore Railroad piers , restore the piers , and restore the steam ferry to Weehawken . It will be kind of a green belt in this perishingly overbuilt city , running all the way across from New Jersey to Long Island , It will attract millions of visitors  --  do n't forget , there 's going to be a huge new convention center right on West Forty-second  --  and it will be just what advanced thinking says we need , what I 've always said we need : a kind of little playground , a restful spot in the middle of an overgrown city . " By the way , everyone was delighted when we got rid of those slowpoke old trolleys back in LaGuardia 's day and replaced them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the drivers of the new buses replacing the slowpoke old trolleys were aghast to discover that the scheduled running time across the city for the buses  --  from the Hudson to the East River  --  was seventeen minutes longer than the scheduled time for the slowpoke trolley cars . The choice is yours . " ? As a bullet seeks its target , shining rails in every part of our great nation are aimed at Grand Central Station , heart of the country 's greatest city . Drawn by the magnetic force of the fantastic metropolis , day and night great trains rush toward the Hudson River . and then ... Grand Central Station ! ... Crossroads of a million private lives . Introduction to a radio series of the forties . TT now turns out that lots of people I have a hidden commitment to Grand Central . Maybe everybody has . Hurting Grand Central inflicts millions of private pains as well as one big civic one . Suburban ladies who put on white gloves and a hat to meet at the Biltmore , commuters , children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to realize that when they come to ( or come hack to ) New York they are greeted not by any small or neutral experience but by a marvellously accessible grandeur , thoroughly democratic but vast enough to encompass the most outlandish aspiration . People are less careless now about what they let people do to things they care about . Proprietors who show no love for what they own are in disrepute . There is now a committee ( formed under the sponsorship of the Municipal Art Society ) not just to " save " Grand Central but to bring to light ways in which the grandeur of the place and its vitality can be restored . The committee is off to a good start : former Mayor Wagner chairs it , Mrs. Onassis is on it , and so are the architect Philip Johnson and Representative Ed Koch , and so are a number of professional people , like Hugh Hardy , who has written an intelligent book called " Reusing Railroad Stations . " The committee had a press conference the other day  --  terse and vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once more , we were there . Members of the committee sat at a table against one of the new wood walls under the nice old coffered ceiling . Their feeling for Grand Central informed what they said , but what they talked about was nonsentimentalabout the greatness of the terminal as a piece of architectural and economic design . One man  --  not a member  --  asked the committee if it was n't " inevitable " for the terminal to come down if it " could n't support itself . " This made us think once more how painfully shortsighted the American commercial view of the " inevitable " is , and a fact sheet we picked up at the meeting reminded us that in 1960 it was proposed that the south waiting room be layered into four floors , and that three of these floors he given over to bowling alleys . What would those three floors of fifteen-year-old howling alleys be like now ? Congressman Koch , by the way , had a good answer for the " inevitable " man . " Central Park does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should ever think of it in that way . " Philip Johnson was direct . " Europe has its cathedrals , " he said . " We have Grand Central . " After the press conference , we walked through Grand Central with Mr. Johnson . Tired proprietors of great buildings , he said , frequently launch campaigns of demoralization to persuade the public that it is " inevitable " for a great building to be demolished or altered . " They eat away at a building , " he said . " They hide its greatness , and then they say , ' What greatness ? ' " In the concourse , Mr. Johnson looked around  --  at the giant Kodak display , at the Chase Manhattan Bank branch , at the freestanding Merrill Lynch display near the west end . " Kodak is bad because it ruins the light , " he said . " The Chase thing is bad , too . But I think Merrill Lynch may be the worst of all . The wonderful thing about a grand space is that there is nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to open an office in the middle of the Piazza San Marco . " We asked Mr. Johnson if the information booth  --  part of the original " Will you lay all the Boilermakers or shall 1 ? " design  --  interfered with the space . " Does the altar bother St. Peter 's ? " he asked . We walked on a bit . " No , I think that Manufacturers Hanover clock is the worst , " Mr. Johnson said . " It destroys the light completely . Right now , this space looks like  --  like St. Patrick 's lit up for television . This building was designed to have a certain dramatic light . Sunlight streaming in from the high windows . As the nld photographs show it . And where that awful clock is you are meant to see through the piers into the bays . Through the glass  --  which has n't been cleaned in twenty-five years into the waiting room , through the waiting-room windows into the sun . But now , of course , all you see is the clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing kept up well now is the floor  --  because human feet are a marvellous cleaning agent . But wait ? Have you seen the concourse where it runs under the Grayhar Buildine For some reason , they 've cleaned it And taken the bookstore out ! And taken out the place that sold those purses ! And it 's wonderful . It 's like Paris after Ma/raux scrubbed it . " We walked with Mr. Johnson to see the Grayhar concourse , and it was indeed splendid . " You know , when they tore down Pennsylvania Station , there were just six of us trying to save it , " Mr , Johnson said . " We stood outside the Station as people went in and out , and they all wanted to know if we were kooks or what . We told them we were trying to save the station . ' What station ? ' they said . That wo n't happen this time . " What Makes a Party Work DOWNSTAIRS at the Americana Hotel , there is a dining room called the Royal Box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which does look like a V.I.P. lounge at Kennedy , only bigger . Not long ago , Lois Fenton , an authority on home entertaining , gave a speech in the Royal Box to a group of women who were attending with their husbands ) the annual convention of the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks , at the Americana . Mrs. Fenton , we decided , looked just like a head stewardess , only better . Mrs. Fenton 's topic was " What Makes a Party Work . " Here is some of what she said : " The first rule of home entertaining is that there really are no rules of home entertaining . There are no rules which you can follow and automatically end up with a great party  --  you have to use your instincts , and do what you 're good at , But if you do n't trust your instincts , or if you do n't have any instincts , certain rules can be helpful . " First , it is important to establish a festive air . I like to do that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you have special candles in special holders  --  candles that you usually , never light  --  either light them or remove them . I hate to go to somebody 's house where it looks as though they 're saving the candles for somebody more FEBRUARY 10 , 19 7 5 said Mrs. Fenton . " I would n't do it for my Aunt Tillie . " " I would n't do it at gunpoint , " said a banker 's wife from Canton , Mississippi , who was sitting on our left . The P-1800 important than me . Men say they hate candles , and sometimes they say they 're going to get the flashlight out of the car so they can see to eat . Do n't listen to them , Men look better in candlelight , just like women . They 're just as vain as we are . " Background music can also help give your party atmosphere . It 's all tight to turn on the radio , if it 's a good-music station , but do n't turn on the television . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party are on Election Night and on New Year 's Day , when the men will all want to watch the football games . " I also like to give my party a light touch  --  something funny or unusual , like a cute invitation or rhyming place cards , Just be sure that it 's not too sweetsie-poo . Also , do n't get carried away . " Surrounding Mrs. Fenton on the demi-stage of the Royal Box were sor- ? eml tables with decorative centerpieces  --  the nuclei of maybe four or five potentially terrific parties  --  and as Mrs. Fenton discussed table-arranging : Ind the construction of centerpieces she moved from one to the next . She showed how to use modelling clay to make candles stand up straight , and how to trim that much-maligned flower the gladiola into an attractive arrangement . She cautioned against the use of paisley napkins with paisley tablecloths ( " That 's just too busy , busy , busy " ) , and she said that a purple-feltand-chrome design scheme was very dramatic-looking . Finally , she showed us a centerpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centerpiece had as its constituent elements an elm root , a feather , two dried protea blossoms , and an iron lamp stand . It looked like something that might get stuck on a boat anchor off the Florida Keys . " This is kind Cif a different one , " JOSEPH MARTIN , a computer methodologist at the Times , has been pursuing for some years what he de-. scribes as " the ideal philosophy of creating a newspaper . " According to the ideal philosophy , you start by " capturing the keystroke at the origin . " Keystroke ? The reporter , at the typewriter , hits the original keystrokes of a story . Martin aims to-absorb them electronically , retain them in a computer , and eliminate all the laborious and manifold retypings that now occur as a piece of writing makes its way , typically , from reporters through bureaus to the home office to the desks of editors and eventually to linotype machines . The ideal philosophy also calls for the elimination of the typing paper that writers write on , which is regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and editors , and with the help of an electronics firm in Westchester , Martin has coaxed into being a device that can actually do all this . The Times is just up the street from us . We went over there the other day to have a look . In the third-floor newsroom , we found routine cacophony : a large open space as aswarm with bodies as the floor of a stock exchange , copy paper in motion everywhere , copy editors looking like physicists with crooked cigarettes and feral eyes , reporters hugging telephones or already down in the trenches  --  sporadic bursts of typing . The machine that was going to tranquillize this scene was locked away in a quiet cubicle . We were led to it by Joe Martin , a slim and somewhat solemn man with graying crewcut hair , and by Socrates Butsfkares , an editor of decades ' experience on various news and feature desks , who now coordinates editorial-staff interests with those of the rest of the company and is thus deeply involved in the electronic innovation . A big man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his tie . We were joined as well by Israel Shenker , who is an old friend of ours and is one of the Times ' bright-star reporters and most skillful writers . Shenker had not previously seen the machine that was designed to change his world . At thirty-two pounds , it rested heavily on a table . Resembling a small blue suitcase , it was eighteen inches by thirteen by seven . It would fit under an airline seat . Its name was Tekram P-1800 Portable Terminal . Butsikares unpacked it . Its principal components were a TV-like cathode-ray tube and a freestanding keyboard that had the conventional " qwertyuiop " arrangement of a typewriter keyboard plus flanking sets of keys that had designations such as " SCRL , " " HOME , " " DEL WORD , " " DEL CHAR , " " CLOSE , " " OPEN , " and " INSET . " Butsikares plugged the keyboard unit into the TV-screen unit , sat down , and began to write . As his fingers fluttered , words instantly surfaced on the screen , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. ? President Ford said today that he would no longer ask the Congress to soak the poor while his fat-cat rich friends take away the wealth of the Republic . " Now , suppose you want to get a little color into this , " Butsikares said , and he began tapping keys  --  marked with arrows pointing up , pointing down , pointing sideways . - around the word " HOME . " A tiny square of light known as the " cursor " began to move up the face of the tube . It was something like the bouncing ball that used to hop from word to word in song lyrics on movie screens . It climbed to the first line , then moved left until Butsikares stopped it in the space between " Ford " , and " said . " He tapped the " INSET " key . He then wrote : , who was wearing his faborite blue suit and his soup-stained blue tie , The new words came into the spare after " Ford , " and to accommodate them the cursor kept shoving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went around corners and down the screen . Butsikares moved the cursor until it rested upon and illumi oared the " b " in " faborite . " He pressed the " DEL CHAR " ( delete character ) button , and the " b " vanished . He replaced it with a " v. " " Now , suppose you want to take a word out , " he said , and moved the cursor to the word " away . " " All the cursor has to do is touch any part of the word , " he went on . " Then you hit the ' DEL - WORD ' key , and it 's gone . " Away went " away , " and the words to either side moved to within a space of each other . Similarly , the cursor could  --  if directed to  --  cat whole lines , whole paragraphs . " What you have written is not set in cement , " Butsikares said . " You can change anything easily . If I had my druthers , I 'd rather write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . " When the screen fills ( it holds about a hundred and twenty-five words ) , the writer just keeps going . For every new line that comes on at the bottom , a line disappears at the top . To go back and look things over , just hit the " Sc.Rt. " key . The whole composition will roll backward or forward like a scroll . In blocks of some three hundred and thirty words ( a little less than half a Times column ) , the developing story is transmogrified into sound frequencies and drawn off into a cassette . If the writer needs to see what is in the cassette , that , too , can be brought back to the screen . At the end , : - Lfter the cursor has made its final tour through the text to help polish up the prose , the reporter goes to the nearest telephone . The P-1800 contains couplings that will fit over the telephone 's earpiece and speaker , and the reporter straps these into place , then dials ( 212 ) 556-1330 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the P-1800 sends words as bleeps to Forty-third Street . If the story is , say , seven hundred and fifty words long , the computer has it all in a little over two minutes . An editor , sitting at an " editing terminal , " can then call for the story and see it instantly . The editor 's machine is much like the reporter 's  --  a
