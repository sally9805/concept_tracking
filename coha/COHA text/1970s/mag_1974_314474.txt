The Brooklyn Academy of Music 's ambitious British Theater Season ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) has opened its second series : three plays by the Actors Company . The troupe is a two-year-old touring cooperative with more promise than polish . Its rules are truly democratic : all decisions about repertory and casting are made by vote . Butto keep chaos from the door - the director of each production has the usual artistic control . That divided authority may explain the unevenness of the fare . The blasted heath of King Lear would seem to be a British company 's natural territory ; instead , Shakespeare provides their weakest evening . In Chekhov 's Russia , on the other hand , they are at home and even offer some accommodation to R.D. Laing'spsychic tangles . <P> WOOD DEMON . This seldom produced Chekhov play is known in theatrical texts chiefly as an early version of Uncle Vanya . The familiar characters are here : the young doctor obsessed by forest conservation ; the fractious old scholar and his bored young wife ; Daughter Sonia and Brother-in-Law George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life with his dead first wife . There are five more major characters in this version who are elided or eliminated when Chekhov created a masterpiece out of the same material . <P> It is a mistake to think of Wood Demon only as a sketchbook for Uncle Vanya . On its own it is an exuberant , if somewhat raveled play . Anyone who has ever watched Vanya or The Three Sisters and wished against all his better aesthetic judgment that one of the attractive , complicated , inhibited egotists would break out and change his lot , will find his fantasies acted out on stage . Though George-played commandingly by Tenniel Evans-shoots himself , Chekhov provides not one but two sets of happy young lovers at the final curtain . In the last act , the young wife , who has briefly left the old professor , remarks that on returning she feels like the ghostly Commendatore in Don Giovanni . As if by magic , the sunnier side of Mozart 's spirit seems to possess Chekhov , and he awards men to his maids with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many bursts of jumbled activity , the main challenge in the play is to the director . David Giles meets it , handling pace and actors with more than breezy authority that gives the entire evening a refreshing , spontaneous lilt . " Martha Duffy <P> KNOTS . One of the central ideas of the oracular psychoanalyst R.D. Laing is that people who are maddened by an irrational society drive each other mad . In his book Knots , a melange of gnomic wordplay , he gave a lively definition of what he meant . For example , he thinks that nearly everyone has come tumbling after an archetypal Jack and Jill caught in such tangles as " I 'm upset that you 're not upset that I 'm upset that you 're upset that I 'm upset when I 'm not . "
