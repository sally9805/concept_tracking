Never one to back away from a fight , Costa Rica 's cocky little ( 5 ft. 3 in . ) President Jos Figueres Ferrer , 65 , last week took a very personal hand in foiling a boringly familiar contemporary crime-the hijacking of a jetliner . <P> " Don Pepe ' ' had just finished a rousing speech in the coffee-growing town of Puriscal. about 20 miles from the capital of San Jos , when an aide handed him an urgent message . Figueres ' old fighting spirit flared as he read that three gunmen from Nicaragua had hijacked a Nicaraguan BAC 1-11 with 40 passengers and six crew members aboard . The plane had just made an unscheduled landing at San Jos airport . Would the President authorize refueling it for the flight on to Havana , or providing a new plane for the trip ? " To hell with this ! " exclaimed Don Pepe . " No damn plane and no damn deal . " <P> Jumping into his chauffeur-driven BMW , he set off for the airport , frequently hitting 110 m.p.h. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his detailed instructions for " terrorizing the terrorists , " who were members of the Nicaraguan National Liberation Front . Two hundred armed civilian guardsmen should surround the plane . The runway should be blocked , the plane 's tires deflated . Don Pepe repeatedly shouted into the radio , " Boys , this is war ! " <P> On the Air . By the time Figueres arrived at the airport , the hijackers had shown that they meant business by shooting one passenger , the son of Nicaragua 's Minister of Agriculture , in the arm and abdomen . They had released the other passengers , but were holding the crew members as hostages in the plane . Costa Rica 's radio stations were able to tune in on the conversation between air crew and tower , so that the entire country could hear one stewardess pleading : " For the love of God , let us go to Cuba ! Otherwise , they 'll kill us . " <P> Unmoved , Figueres grabbed an M-3 submachine gun , ran to the scene and ordered his troopers to pump tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing broke out inside the plane . Don Pepe gave the order to attack . " Get them ! " he cried . The plane 's rear door suddenly dropped open and a stewardess hurtled clown the steps unhurt . One of the gunmen followed , but was cut down by a hail of bullets before he hit the ground . After that , the two other skyjackers surrendered , and the crew escaped without injury . <P> Don Pepe meanwhile was fighting with his own guards , who were trying to wrestle a submachine gun away from him in order to keep him from getting hurt in any shootout . Even though Figueres did not get to fire a single shot , he was pleased with his performance .
