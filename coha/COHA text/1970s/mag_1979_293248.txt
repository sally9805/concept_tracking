Carter picks Donald McHenry to replace Andrew Young <P> When U.N . Ambassador Andrew Young resigned after his secret approach to the Palestine Liberation Organization , the nation 's black leaders erupted in hostility toward Jewish groups , which they blamed , somewhat unfairly , for the ouster of the highest black in Government . Last week President Carter named an adroit successor to Young : Donald F. McHenry , 42 , a top deputy at the U.N . mission . Though close to Young and equally absorbed in African affairs , McHenry is a polished career diplomat who is as well known for prudence as Young is for impetuosity . <P> Carter had considered others for the post , including former Iowa Senator Dick Clark , former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan , Panama Canal Negotiator Sol Linowitz and Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock . But McHenry had the advantage of being a black as well as having the support of Young . His main disadvantage was that he was not well known . Then the Soviets came to his assistance when they tried to rush Ballerina Ludmila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laborious negotiations with the Soviets at Kennedy Airport . Deputy White House Press Secretary Rex Granum said that the President was impressed with Mc-Henry 's " toughness and coolness under fire and strong , forceful negotiating techniques . " The appointment , said Young , " reaffirms the Administration 's commitments to the United Nations and to the policies that we have worked together so closely on . " <P> McHenry 's rise to his present post has been low-keyed and skillful . Born in St. Louis , he graduated from Illinois State University and earned a master 's degree in international relations at Southern Illinois University . In 1963 he joined the State Department as a junior officer in the Office of United Nations Political Affairs and rose quickly through the ranks . A liberal concerned with the humanitarian side of foreign policy , he left the department when Henry Kissinger became Secretary , and joined the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . <P> When Carter was elected , McHenry returned to a more congenial environment in the State Department and was made Young 's deputy . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express them more tactfully and precisely . Says his daughter Christina : " When he says something , he knows exactly what he is saying . " He is described as the classic understated statesman with a scholar 's rather than a preacher 's approach to diplomacy . At his best in behind-the-scenes maneuvering , he led a protracted effort to get the Front Line African states , as well as South Africa , to agree to an independent Namibia . Talking to the press last week , McHenry lamented the high visibility of his new post . " It 's difficult to accomplish foreign policy objectives in a fishbowl , " he said . " I ca n't sneak around any more . " But he plans to maintain something of a private life . Though divorced from his first wife , he spends as much time as he can with his two daughters , who live with him in Manhattan , and his Oxford-educated son , who is in Boston paradoxically training to be a chef .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
