 | Of course there was hell to pay . Fairchild men came running . From where I was , still halfway down the outside staircase of Uncle Dawkins Fairchild 's store , I could see Calvin leave the big camera he was so proud of and run to Mr. Stein . Someone 's horse was screaming , and Cousin Wash Fairchild 's mules became frantic and tried to run off with his wagon . It was seconds before I moved , and when I did it was to my father and Calvin and Mr. Stein . I swear to God that , because of the unsanctioned way he 'd done things , it never once crossed my mind to go back up the stairs and confront Otis Wasum . It was n't at all that I was afraid . Mr. Stein was leaning against Calvin when I got to them , with Calvin 's arms around him , and my father kneeling on the other side . Mr. Stein 's blood spurted out over Calvin 's good suit , bought for traveling . His throat was making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Wash Fairchild 's mules , until my father said , " That will do , Pepper . " He sounded just as cold and calm and polite as he always did . He mostly went on sounding that way until we left , that same afternoon , as he insisted we must . He did not come to the stage to say good-bye . I thought it was because he was so mad at me , as I was mad at him , but to tell the truth , it probably just did n't occur to him . But that was my father 's way . He refused to show that anything could ruffle him , not even the grief that Otis Wasum brought to us that day , by impropriety and poor shooting , in the county seat of Claiborne Parish where we Fairchilds mostly lived and which Calvin and I were leaving that day , first by stage , then by catching the V.S. &; P. Railroad in Shreveport . I had never been on either a stage or a railroad before , but I 'd seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the trouble started I had been saying farewell to it in my thoughts , figuring it would be the whole summer before I saw it again . Naturally , I should have been enjoying myself . Farewell to Homer , Louisiana , which I felt would probably find a place in history only as my birth site . Farewell to the family , just about all of whom had come to town to see us off , and to Mr. Stein , down for his annual visit from New York . Farewell to a boy I saw on the street , Timmy McClanahan , who at fourteen was younger than I , so I ordinarily did n't associate with him much ,  | but who shared my passion for base ball and once traded me a card I coveted of Michael J. " King " Kelly of the Chicago White Stockings for one which pictured the world 's most famous longdistance hitter , Roger Connor of the Troys . I had stopped to talk to Timmy for a minute , and the reason was n't nice : as close as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peevish about an errand he had sent me on , and was getting even by dawdling . It was bad enough to have everyone in the parish watching him try to take a photograph and being ready to laugh at him , as they always did , and , therefore , getting a snicker or two ready for anyone who happened to be associated with him in public , which was me . Having to run the errand , which was to tell a Wasum that Calvin asked him please to stay out of the picture , seemed just one straw too many . And I had to be associated in public with Calvin . I was being sent by the family to look after him during our travels , which were to take Calvin and me to Denison City , Texas , to pick up a photographer 's wagon that was to be equipment for Calvin 's new profession in San Diego , California . I was to drive the mules for him and deliver him to a Mr. John Swiss Parker in California , who was some kin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my duty was generally to help him , I 'd already been helping him all I could to take a photograph that Uncle Dawkins wanted of his mercantile store with the family all lined up in front of it . But though Calvin and I were good friends , it was beginning to shame me to be seen so much in his company , particularly since a bunch of tiny kids were hanging around , jostling the legs of the tripod and trying to get a peek through the camera and giggling , as they always did , every time Calvin spoke . Everyone said Calvin stuttered , but he did n't really . He was born with a harelip , which Grandmother said had n't been basted in time , so he could n't always speak too plainly . But what the main trouble looked like was , when he was troubled or nervous or maybe had some difficult word to say , the word got stuck in his mouth . His torn upper lip and his good lower lip clamped shut while he worked on it , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like , " . . . Pepper , there 's someone in the top of the picture . " If he really stuttered , as the people in the parish  | did when they mocked him , it would have been " Puh-Puh-PuhPepper " or " puh-puh-puh-picture . " That was when I first saw Otis Wasum in the window . At that particular moment I was ducked in under the focusing cloth . I peered into the ground glass of the big view camera the family had bought Cousin Calvin , and sure enough , upside down at the bottom of the glass , there was someone in the second-story window of Uncle Dawkins 's store . " It looks like one of the Wasums , " I said . " Oh lord , " Calvin sighed . He sounded worried , and I ducked back out from under the cloth . Calvin was sweating . It was late May , so the weather was already good and hot , and Calvin was working hard to take the photograph before his plate dried . But I knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to hurry up . " Go ahead , " I said . " He wo n't show . He 's too far up . " " Yes he will , " Cousin Calvin said . " And he 's not Fairchild kin . " Of course , a Wasum was n't . Fairchilds and Wasums never went hunting together and never even married , because twenty years ago , right after the war , there had been trouble between us , and there had been new trouble between us over a court case that very spring . Until today , the only new fighting was just a fistfight between me and Otis Wasum , but the feelings between us Fairchilds and the Wasums remained uneasy . Well , so there was a Wasum in the window of Uncle Dawkins 's store , and that would never do in a Fairchild family portrait , and Calvin was worried about it . I said , " Ca n't you shoot the picture without the top story showing ? " Calvin 's face got more worried-looking , as it always did when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw and neck muscles tightened , and there was this little silence before he managed to get out , " Please , Pepper . Just go tell him I asked him to stay out of sight until after the picture . " The bunch of little kids giggled at him again , and I walked away quickly . There was a good crowd in town . No doubt a lot of the parish people were just attending to everyday business  | and trading , but there was also plenty of talk about my and Calvin 's trip as well . So there was Timmy McClanahan , and I stopped to tell him farewell for the whole summer , hoping that whoever was in the window above the store would maybe get out of the picture on his own . Then I went on up the outside staircase to the second story of Uncle Dawkins 's store , not very fast and not liking it . The store loft was loaded to the brim with cartons of cigars , sacks of onions , old furniture that Grandmother wanted him to keep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken in trade and such , and I wended my way through dim stacks and bales , and I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw that it was Otis Wasum who was sitting in the window . Otis was slight-built and fair , like all the Wasums . We were n't friends even before the new trouble ; Otis did n't seem to care for friends . But of course I knew him a little , especially because he had been working at Uncle Dawkins 's store until his father got mad at my father over the court case , and Otis quit . Then we 'd had our fistfight , and it seemed highly inappropriate to me for Otis Wasum to be sitting in a Fairchild store on a Fairchild rice sack , staring vacantly out the window . I saw that he was eating an apple , a rifle leaning against the wall beside him , and an empty gunnysack near his feet , but I attended first to the thing I 'd come about , the window . I said belligerently , " Otis Wasum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiling the picture . " " Oh , " he said , startled . He jerked back away from the window , looking apologetic . Then he recovered himself and mumbled , as I have said , " You little Fairchild sonofabitch . " He added , " You got no right to tell me what to do . " I said , " And you got no right to be in my Uncle Dawkins 's loft eating his apples . " I doubled up my fists and prepared to resume our fight , if that 's what he wanted . As an afterthought , I also added , " You Wasum sonofabitch . " " You better be careful , " he said . " You just remember that your daddy and my daddy is on the edge of a blood feud , and if you get too smart , you 're just likely to be right in the middle of it . " " That 's silly talk , " I said . " There ai n't going to be no feud unless your daddy goes clean out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairchilds than there ever will be Wasums , and your daddy surely knows enough arithmetic to know when he 's well off . Us Fairchilds would swamp you in a week . " " Numbers would n't make no difference if the head was cut off , " he said . " The head ? " I said . " Whatever are you talking about ? " Otis stared at me , and his pale blue eyes were motionless as stones . After a second , he shook his head two or three times and mumbled , " What 's the matter with you , Pepper Fairchild ? Your Uncle Dawkins do n't care if I sit in his loft , he lets me come up here . " " You 're lying , " I said . " My Uncle Dawkins do n't want nothing to do with the Wasums since your daddy went so hog-wild about his hogs . What 's more , you stole them apples , and furthermore , what are you doing with that rifle ? I 'll bet you stole that rifle , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's your brother 's rifle . Shirley will skin you alive for swiping his rifle . Otis never spoke very loudly , and he had a good case of the mumbles that day . He said something about " . . . my brother knows " and " . . . going squirrel hunting " and then his voice came up a little and his washed-out eyes began to move about , and he said , " Be careful what you say , Pepper Fairchild , or I 'll give you a taste of what I gave you two weeks ago . " All right , I admit it , maybe I backed away a step or two . It was because of the way Otis 's eyes looked . But I said , " You never whipped me . Maybe that 's what you 've been telling people , but you never did . " " You just watch out , " he said . " Well , you just stay away from that window and stop ruining other people 's photographs , " I said . He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , feeling I 'd told him off pretty stoutly , but worrying about that fistfight . The way it looked to me , it had been a pretty even fight . No , more than that . I won . Otis and I were about of a size , but he was older , and I stood up to him for a full twenty minutes , down by Dr. Paul McDade 's cow lot , and it was Otis who backed down , or I felt I 'd have still been there fighting . I shoved through the bales and boxes and to the top of the outside stairs , and I got there just in time to hear my father call  | out , " Calvin , if you 're going to take this photograph , you 'd better take it right now . " I think my father was thinking about my new stepmother standing out there in the sun , with two or three of the little nephews arranged in front of her . My father said it politely , as he said everything , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin could too . Calvin said , " All right , everybody hold real still now . " So I was stuck . I could n't run downstairs and through the picture , or that would have ruined it . I could n't see the family , lined up in front of the store , but from the stairs I could see Calvin across the street , hurrying to arrange the focusing cloth on the back of the camera . He fumbled around , carefully removing the shield from the plateholder with the big glass plate we 'd got ready earlier . Then he took off the lens cap and called again , " Now be still . Be real still . " I held my breath . He wanted it just right , you see . The family was all there watching Calvin , and he was leaving , and the family had spent a lot of time and money for his training and all the equipment and arranging for the photographer 's wagon and arranging for him to have his new profession in California . So it was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd even loaded the new James Flash Lamp the family had bought him , because he had said the sun was so high it would cast dark shadows on all the faces unless he used flashlight powder to lighten them . I felt guilty when I saw him grab up the lamp . I was supposed to hold it for him . But I told myself that it was Calvin who had sent me away . The flash powder went off , brighter than the sun . Calvin clamped the lens cap back on the camera and sang out , " All right . Everybody can move now . " His voice was happy . The family broke up then , and everybody started talking . My father and Mr. Stein walked out in the street to speak to Calvin . I started down the stairs , half thinking that I 'd better rush down and join Calvin in our makeshift darkroom to help him develop the exposed plate , and half thinking that I should run tell Uncle Dawkins about his apples , and then tell Shirley Wasum , Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rifle . 9  | That was when it finally came to me . I gasped , " Oh my God . " My lips were forming the words , " Father , Father , " to call out to him . And Otis Wasum started shooting . Mr. Stein , who had chosen the wrong moment to walk in front of my father , fell with a bullet through his throat on the first shot . I believe it was the third or fourth shot that nicked my father in the hand . When the wild shooting stopped , my young stepmother ran out into the street to my father , but he turned her around and gave her a little nudge away from the mortally wounded Mr. Stein . Some said later that Mr. Stein 's throat bled on the hem of her dress , but that was n't so . What was so is that my father 's blood soiled her , for I saw it . But then there was blood everywhere , and spatters of that lemon layer cake . Grandmother was vain , in the nicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cake in the photograph . So there was everything happening all at once , and it was happening fast . When I could make my legs move and run the rest of the way down the stairs , I pushed my way , mostly through Fairchilds , to my father and Calvin and Mr. Stein , as I have said . People were staring around , some up at the store windows , and my Uncle Raleigh , who was a Hillman and not a Fairchild and therefore had not been in the picture , boomed out , " It come from up there . " A cluster of my uncles and some of the grown-up cousins and some of the men from the street followed his pointing arm and rushed up the stairs I had just come down . Others ran into the Homer Iliad building next door . I stayed where I was and watched Mr. Stein die . The whole family took it hard . They were upset , of course , that my father had been shot at , but he was alive and Mr. Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed while he was our company . That any harm should come to him , a Fairchild guest , hit by a bullet aimed , badly , at a Fairchild , was scarcely to be borne . But I knew it was hardest on Calvin and my grandmother . Calvin had two special friends in the world , me and Mr. Stein , and he had just returned in early spring from spending six months with Mr. Stein in New York , learning how to take views and portraits under a fine photographic artist Mr. Stein  | knew there and persuaded to teach Calvin , so Calvin could have his profession . My grandmother 's grief came from the fact that Mr. Stein had saved my grandfather 's life in the war . Mr. Stein was a Jew from Bad Ocheim , in Bavaria , Germany . He was a back-peddler through the Carolinas and around when he first came over , and he told good stories of those times , but he stopped peddling and started soldiering when the war came . Rightly or wrongly , he chose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois , when my grandfather was captured and taken there . Rock Island for a southern prisoner was like Andersonville for a northern prisoner : a grave for living men . Things being the way they had been , there was little Mr. Stein or other well-intentioned men could do , and as Mr. Stein used to tell it , saying " I 'm sorry " does n't feed someone who 's starving . It was Grandmother who decided more or less independently that Mr. Stein had saved Grandfather 's life , later after the war ended and he began to come down once a year to visit with Grandfather . When Grandfather died , he still kept coming to see the family . Of course we had all adopted Grandmother 's view . Mr. Stein was a hero , and we treasured him . He died in such pain that I could barely stand it . It did n't take more than a few minutes , but if I had had a gun with me I would have put it to his head and pulled the trigger and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't necessarily correct ; perhaps it 's myself I would have saved from witnessing those few minutes of his pain . Instead , I finally stumbled away from Mr. Stein and got my arms around one of the posts by Uncle Dawkins 's store and butted my forehead against its rough wood and panted to myself over and over , " Sonofabitch , sonofabitch , sonofabitch . " I was then fifteen , and I was n't supposed to say that kind of thing . My stepmother , who was only nineteen herself , heard me and immediately started saying , " Why , Pepper Fairchild ! " and , " Shame ! " and things like that . I told her , " Keep the hell away from me ! " She raised her hands to her bosom and blinked at me . Her eyes were a shade you rarely see , a clear , light green , clear and bright like some jewel , and she was very full in the blouse . Her II  | hands raised that way showed the golden wedding ring my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be going out ; her blouse was already even fuller , and her waist thickening , so that she had taken lately always to muffling herself in a shawl . Both the shawl and her skirts had the blood on them . The sound from Mr. Stein 's throat was growing fainter . I tried to collect myself . They called me Pepper not only because I had red hair but because of my temperament , and no one except perhaps Calvin knew the efforts I sometimes made to control myself . I said , " Beg pardon , " and started to turn away , but she grabbed my arm . She stared at me a second , then dropped her green eyes and looked flustered . Flustered myself , I said , " Something has got on your dress . Let me take you inside the store . " I touched her elbow and guided her into the leather and molasses and new-cloth smell of Uncle Dawkins 's store , running through all the confusion of Fairchild uncles and aunts and cousins . Two aunts came hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl on a bright day in late May , and I turned her over to them . My place was not with her . Nor was it with my father ; I thought he 'd made that clear by that cold , calm way he 'd spoken to me . If anywhere , it was with Calvin , and I started back to him . But directly in my path , walking along just as casually as you please from around back of the store , was Otis Wasum . Otis did n't say anything . He stared at me with those pale blue eyes , and they said enough . His hands went to the back of his pants , brushing , brushing off dust , and then he leaned and dusted off his knees . His nostrils were trembling like a rabbit 's . But he still did n't say anything , and I said , low , trying to keep my voice from trembling as much as his nose , " May you be goddamned to the deepest hell , you stinking Wasum bastard . " " Bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since many people thought he was . But Otis never blinked . He said softly , " This begins it . You open your mouth , and I 'll kill you . If I have to chase you to hell , I 'll kill you . " I believe in the next second I might have reached for his neck , or maybe those staring eyes . There is , of course , pleasure in I2  | rage , and I really believe I might have done that . But my father , at that moment , seeing me lean toward Otis , called one disgusted word , " Pepper ! " And at that same moment my Uncle Raleigh came running down the store steps . " Here 's the rifle , Judge , " my Uncle Raleigh yelled , holding it in the air . " It was jammed behind the rice sacks , upstairs . " He ran , naturally , even being a Hillman , to my father . My Uncle Bentley Fairchild leaned over my father 's shoulder and looked at it and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell yes it is , " Uncle Raleigh said . By natural gravity , other men were drawing near my father where he was kneeling with Calvin beside Mr. Stein 's body . Sam Spinks , one of the grown-up cousins , darted suddenly aside . When he came back into view he was drawing Shirley Wasum with him . Shirley , fair and blue-eyed just like Otis but a good ten or so pounds heavier , being maybe ten years older , was one of those wild , tough young fellows who like to do things only in their own way and in their own good time . He looked daggers at Sam Spinks for daring to touch him like that , but he certainly made no effort to run away . " That ai n't my rifle , " Shirley said negligently but in a voice of tempered steel . Uncle Raleigh held up the .38-40 Model 73 Winchester with " r of i , 000 " engraved on the barrel . The rifle was known well in the parish , which is how I had recognized it earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it back in ' 75 , when the whole parish was eating pone instead of cornbread , as we could n't afford leavening just at that time . Uncle Raleigh sputtered , " Why , man , you 're telling me this ai n't your rifle ? " Shirley inspected it and began to look puzzled . " It ca n't be , " he said . " I left mine home . " Now came Mr. Wasum , Otis 's and Shirley 's daddy , pushing through the crowd . He had graying fair hair and the same blue eyes and he was snapping , " What 's this , what 's this , what 's this ? " but you had to be from Claiborne Parish to understand him , because he would never wear his teeth . Shirley understood him , of course , and flinched like a puppy dog that fears a scolding . The older Wasum boys and their r3  | father helled around together , hunted possum together , and , the parish tsk-tsked , all drank together once each boy got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his oldest sons Mr. Wasum never let them forget he ruled the roost . Shirley said to Mr. Wasum placatingly , " Hell , Daddy , I guess it looks like my gun , but it ca n't be . I left mine home . " So Mr. Wasum said to the men around him , " Do n't you go accusing my boy . He did n't shoot at Judge Fairchild . I taught my boys better than that . If Shirley had wanted to face down the judge , he would have called him out in the street . " More men had hurried up , filling in and widening the circle . I had to push hard to get through them , and I tugged my Uncle Raleigh 's sleeve . " It was n't Shirley , " I said . " It was Otis . " Uncle Raleigh , distracted by all the noise , said to me , " What ? " Everyone was talking and pressing close to look at the rifle . I raised my voice . " It was Otis who shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " I gestured to the top story of the store . Mr. Wasum looked bewildered . He said , " Why that ca n't be ! " Then he gazed over my shoulder , questioningly . I turned . Otis Wasum had followed along right behind me . Now , although Otis struck the parish as indifferent and at times downright hostile to his older brothers , everyone knew he was at least enough like them to think Mr. Wasum made the sun rise every morning , and with his father 's eyes on him Otis seemed to lose confidence . He mumbled to me , " You 're crazy with the heat . I been right here , all the time . " Mr. Wasum said sternly to Otis , " Are you sure ? " Otis nodded . So Mr. Wasum said to my father , " Judge , ca n't you control that whelp of yours any better ? He 's got no call to be making up a pack of lies just because Otis whipped him a couple of weeks ago . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir . " " Shhhh , " my Uncle Raleigh said . The whole crowd was muttering . Then the undertaker , Mr. Willis Blountley , moved in and grabbed Otis 's arm . Mr. Wasum 's face got a troubled look . He glanced quickly at me , then at his youngest son , Otis , and lastly he looked at Shirley . He said , " Shirley , tell them . Otis could n't have done it .  | Shirley seemed fuddled . He said , " I do n't know what happened , Daddy . I was n't nowhere near . I was over to the blacksmith 's , looking at them new mules . " " Ah , son , " Mr. Wasum said . There was misery in his voice . " They 're going to put your little brother in jail . You ca n't let them do that . Tell them the truth . " And Shirley 's face seemed to snap to attention with understanding . He said , " Oh ! " and then , " No , no , the Fairchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was me did it . " The crowd muttered still more . I said , " But I saw him . He was in the way of Calvin 's picture , and I went up there to tell him to move . It was Otis , and I marched right up to him , and I saw him with Shirley 's rifle by the window . There 's not a chance in the world I 'm mistaken . " Everyone looked at me . Oddly . Everyone but Shirley . Shirley looked at his daddy , and he firmed his jaw , and he said , " He did n't do no such thing . I do n't like to say it , but Judge Fairchild 's boy is lying . It was me in that window , and the boy never came anywhere near it . " My Uncle Raleigh said , " If someone was in the way of Calvin 's picture , then he would show , would n't he ? What about it , Calvin ? " Calvin turned his eyes up from Mr. Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , but his words got stuck . Finally he said , " Maybe . I got a glimpse of someone when I took the photograph . He might have come back after Pepper left . " Naturally , it was my father who took over . He 'd been holding his fingers on Mr. Stein 's wrist , where the pulse would have been . The throat is better , some say , for a weak pulse , but with poor Mr. Stein that was impossible . My father rose and wiped his hands absently with his handkerchief . " Is that so , Calvin ? Was one of the Wasums in the photograph ? " He spoke slowly and a little loudly , as he always did with Calvin . Maybe because he never spent much time with Calvin , my father seemed to figure both Calvin 's mind and his ears were as defective as his speech . " Yessir , " Calvin said . " At least I think so . " " Was it Otis or Shirley ? " my father said . Calvin looked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15  | I do n't know , sir . I guess I was too busy to pay much attention . " " Is a photograph evidence , Judge ? " Mr. Blountley asked . " I do n't know what the precedent might be , " my father said , " but we 'd better look at it . Go on , now , Calvin . Pepper , go help your cousin . Calvin shook his head . He was dead white , and his eyes kept going to poor dead Mr. Stein . " The plate 's probably spoiled , " he said . " Collodion dries right fast . " Shirley Wasum said , " I do n't know what all this fuss is about . It 's my rifle , and I said I did it , and I did it . " " Sir , " I said . " It was Otis . I saw him . " My father only nodded and said , " Go help Calvin develop that plate . " Blood was trickling down between my father 's little finger and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ignored it , and he seemed stoically determined to ignore me , too . I went . I was so mad that tears were in my own eyes by now , and my face was hot , and my ears felt bright red . Just because my father had been acting funny and testy with me ever since he 'd remarried , and just because he 'd been so touchy about my fistfight with Otis Wasum , did n't mean he should n't believe his own son . I was a witness . I was better than any photograph . I saw it . Otis Wasum shouldered me hard when I walked by and whispered , " You 're going to get it now . You 'll see . " His daddy grabbed him by the collar and held on , but Otis did n't do anything else . He just stared at me . I helped Calvin carry the big , heavy camera into the back of the store to the little room we had prepared , and got a fresh bucket of water before we closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera . Usually I just stood out of the way , so Calvin would n't run into me in the dark , but today I stuck close to him and felt for and found his shoulder and said , " You all right , Calvin ? " " I 'm all right , " he said . " Poor Mr. Stein , " I said . " We 'll talk about him later , " he said . I dropped my hand from Calvin 's shoulder , but his hand came and found my arm . He pressed it quickly . " You 're my part-  | ner , Pepper , " he said . " There ai n't no words for what a help that is . " Well , Calvin tried as hard as he could with that dried plate . He poured ferrous sulphate over it and said he was ready and I took away a rag we 'd stuffed in a crack in the boards and held a piece of red glass over it , the way we 'd figured things out , to give Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away on the plate and got brighter by the minute , but from what I could see this one was coming slowly . Calvin kept working with it , and I kept standing there holding the red glass . To tell the truth , I did n't really pay close attention to what Calvin was doing . At that moment , I was mostly concerned with just being furious with Otis and Shirley Wasum for lying and with my father for apparently choosing to believe that I , rather than they , was the liar . It was not as though I was surprised to think that , if my father had been shot at , it was a Wasum who did it . The bad feeling between us , as I have said , went back twenty years , when Mr. Wasum fought a duel with Grandfather . The duel took place by the courthouse square , and everybody in the world saw it , but it was a duel that the parish even twenty years ago had discussed only behind their hands , because both its cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case women and children might be listening . The cause was a Galloway bull that Mr. Wasum brought all the way from Scotland before the war . Mrs. Wasum and the whole tribe of older Wasum boys , then mostly just little boys , managed to keep the bull alive and healthy during the war . So the war ended , but in our parish things just seemed to get worse . A lot of good land lay fallow because of a want of field hands , and so did a lot of good cows because of a want of a seed bull . Times were so bad that the Wasums needed money , like everybody else in the parish , but nobody could afford the fee that Mr. Wasum wanted for that Galloway bull 's service . They argued about that , my grandfather and Mr. Wasum . My grandfather 's position was : we all had to stick together until times got better , and then Mr. Wasum could collect all the back fees he wanted off the bull , because then folks could afford r7  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bull , and he needed money now , and he had n't heard of my grandfather just giving away his cotton . So they compared their watches and met at two in the afternoon on the square . Our code duello was n't fancy , but it was strict . Each man , as was prescribed , stepped out to the center of the street and started walking toward the other , carrying his gun in his hand , and it was fire at will . Mr. Wasum smoked a cigar all the way through it , which produced a lot of admiration for him in our parish , and he nearly killed Grandfather with a bullet in the stomach and one in the arm , once they got within fifteen or twenty feet and started hitting each other . But Grandfather hit Mr. Wasum , too , and what made the duel indecent was not only the seed bull that started it but that Grandfather shot Mr. Wasum in the crotch . Grandfather was ashamed and mad as hell about it once he got well enough to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to be mad and ashamed and grieved about . Uncle Camden Fairchild , my father 's brother and Calvin 's father , shot the bull in revenge , then the Wasums had shot him , and an all-out feud had broken out between the families . Like war , feuds had no set rules in our part of the world . The practice was to shoot on sight , and there was plenty of shooting . Grandfather and Mr. Wasum both tried , but it took months and months to make peace , and of course we never truly forgave each other for the various killings . I guess , in a way , Otis was among the casualties . He was born three years after the duel , and there was considerable doubt in the parish that Mr. Wasum , crotch-shot as he was , could have sired him . Mr. Wasum appeared to doubt it too , at least at first , and although Otis grew up looking like all the other Wasum boys , he never acted like them  --  standoffish where they were hailfellow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namby-pamby where they were unbridled rogues . Once Otis got to be of a fair size and the old man noticed he apparently had another son , Mr. Wasum seemed downright troubled by Otis , and baffled , too , as the parish knew , like a hen that 's hatched a clutch of duck eggs and is straining itself to cope with the result .  | So that was the old trouble . The new trouble had almost started that spring , over land the Wasums held out on Dorcheat Bayou . Nowadays , the Wasums did n't do much with their land besides running a few hogs , and hunting , and fishing in the bayou , but the Long Bell Company came in right next to them and set up a sawmill , and got the V.S. &; P. Railroad to set up a leg of track to take the timber to the mill . It looked to me like progress , a thing I was interested in , but Mr. Wasum claimed his land was mined , what with hogs , game , and fish all scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went so far as to bring the quarrel to court , but my father sat on the case and nolle prossed it for lack of evidence . I low could man communicate well enough with hogs , I heard him joke to my new stepmother once , to know whether they felt harassed by noise or just finally had deduced that if they stayed around their tribe would surely be decimated every fall ? What nearly happened this time was not a duel but an affray . That had its own set of rules and procedures , too , and Mr. Wasum embarked upon the affray properly enough by warning my father that he 'd better go armed . Mr. Wasum then had the obligation , if they chanced to meet , to refrain from drawing his own gun until he cried out the usual warning , " Defend yourself ! " And I maintain that there was n't a soul in the parish , knowing the Wasums and the Fairchilds and the rules , who would have doubted that if a Wasum chanced to meet a Fairchild and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasum had left his gun at home or just was n't in the mood that day , and there would have been no shooting . That was the way we did things , or would have , if Mr. Wasum had n't apparently cooled off and counted up on his fingers and realized that we Fairchilds outnumbered the Wasums by almost three to one , and finally called off the affray . I heard a little taunting by the boys around town telling Otis the Wasums sure had been quick to back down , but there was n't any killing and there was n't any trouble , except that a Wasum and a Fairchild maybe got in fistfights , if we were still boys and one boy said some nasty thing about the other boy 's father and new young stepmother , which I never breathed one syllable of to anyone . But in Claiborne Parish we just did not skulk around in the top stories of Ig  | mercantile stores and , without a single word of warning , shoot people down in the streets . I guess the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis who committed such a violent , improper act , and not Mr. Wasum or even Shirley or one of the other full-grown Wasums . Yes , all right , we 'd had the one fight , but Otis was the quiet Wasum , close-mouthed and steady like his ma , people said when they were trying to talk nice about him , and not boisterous and wild like the other boys and his daddy . And he was only seventeen , and I would be that in two years , and for all my temper it had never even crossed my mind to want to kill somebody . Cousin Calvin was dipping fresh water from the water bucket . I could tell by the sound . In the dim light I thought I saw him reaching for the bottle of potassium cyanide to pour over the plate . " Did it do ? " I said . " Can you see it 's Otis ? " " The plate got awful dry , " Calvin said . He kept tinkering . I started wondering , if Otis Wasum had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second story of the store , cried out , " Defend yourself , " instead of skulking and mumbling so he could sneak a later shot at my father , what would I have done ? Tried to make the first grab for that .38-40 Winchester , and shot him ? Dead ? There was another thing that I did n't think about . Or tried not to , anyway . That is , when I first heard those shots , and saw people falling , who did I think would end up dead ? Surely not poor Mr. Stein . And there was the question in my mind : considering the way he 'd tongue-whipped me after I had the fistfight , and told me not to interfere in the affairs of my elders , which I thought I certainly had n't , and sentenced me to a whole week in the smokehouse when the family was having barbecues and picnics and fish fries almost daily in honor of Mr. Stein 's visit and my and Calvin 's upcoming trip , and when I flared and told him plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and did n't care for me any more because of the baby on the way , and he said calmly that I was just a boy and did n't understand anything about fairness and would have to grow up before I understood adult problems ; considering everything , then , when those shots blammed out : what if ? Calvin washed the plate again , dipping water over and over  | it , and I judged it was all right to stop holding up the red glass and let just the crack of natural light come in . I poured water for Calvin to wash his hands . " It got too dry , Pepper , " Calvin said . " You ca n't make out much of anything . Even Mr. Stein . But I guess that 's not the kind of portrait a person would want anyway , is it ? Poor Mr. Stein , standing there smiling , not knowing that in five minutes he 'd be dead ? " His voice was chokey , and he cleared his throat , and I said , " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll show better . " We did . The store was full of Fairchilds . Everybody stopped talking when we came out , and my Uncle Raleigh came to me , looking mad as though he 'd been arguing , and banged me on the shoulder a few times . Everybody looked at me . Still very oddly . Well , Uncle Dawkins got down a piece of black cloth , and we laid the glass negative on it so as to make a positive . Everybody came crowding around . Sure enough , in the very tip-top , there was something blurry in the window , something that could have been a face . But anything that dim , it could have been anybody . There was a big , collective sigh , and everybody started looking happier , although I could n't for the life of me see why . " It got too dry , " Calvin said again , awkwardly . My Uncle Raleigh said , " Do n't you trouble yourself about it , Calvin . This business of photographing must be mighty tricky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed right away , " Calvin said . " And the way things happened ... " " Not a soul in the world could have done more , " Uncle Raleigh said . My father came into the store . My stepmother moved over to speak to him , and she must have told him about the plate not coming out , for my father said to Calvin , " Calvin , you 'd better get someone to help you clean off your suit , and get all your camera things packed now . The stage is due in not more than a half-hour . And both of you , be sure you get over to say good-bye to your grandmother before you go . They 've taken her to Mrs. Idabelle Sealy 's . She 'll be even more upset if you do n't go to say good-bye . " 2 . I  | I suppose I just gaped at him . I said , " But sir , we ca n't go now . I 'm a witness . So 's Calvin . " My father glanced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " since Shirley Wasum confessed . They 've taken him over to the jail . " " But Father ! " I said . " It was Otis in the window ! I saw him . I spoke to him . " The Fairchilds in the store did n't murmur . They did n't even seem to breathe . They all just turned away . I looked at them , confounded . My father said to Uncle Dawkins , " Dawk , can we use your office for a minute ? " " Certainly , certainly , " Uncle Dawkins said , and everyone drifted away from us , like fishing corks in a fast current . My father and I did n't even go to Uncle Dawkins 's office . We just stood there by the yard goods and talked . My father 's hand kept smoothing the piece of black cloth that Uncle Dawkins had spread out . He said , " I think it will be best for you to go on with your Cousin Calvin , Pepper . As Calvin is incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're young but capable , and a summer away from home will give you a chance to reconsider our ? " I said , " But , my God ? " His face hardened , and he said , " Do n't let me hear you talk that way . " I said , " But Father , I 'm a witness . " He said , " I want no more of your back talk . Perhaps I 'm wrong about you . Perhaps you 're not even capable of a simple thing like helping your cousin get to where he 's got to go . If you do n't feel you 're up to the obligation , just say so , and we 'll get some other member of the family to do it . " I said , " It 's not that , sir . It 's Otis Wasum . I thought you 'd want me to stay here and testify . " My father looked at me , and I was gradually coming to know the expression . It 's the way the crowd of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the family had just looked at me . He said , " Regarding your quarrel with young Otis , whatever your reasons for resorting to falsehoods about him , I would prefer that we discuss it no further . "  | " Sir ? You think I 'm lying ? " " You leave me very little choice , " he said . " I must either consider you a liar or a coward . Taking into consideration your blood and your rearing , do you really want me to believe that you saw Otis Wasum , and you did n't try to stop him ? " My insides turned over . I said haltingly , " But sir , you ca n't think I knew what he was going to do ! " " You 've insisted on saying to everyone within hearing distance that you saw Otis in the window holding a rifle , that you even spoke to him . No wonder the others drew such an obvious conclusion . Pepper Fairchild . Judge Fairchild 's son . Craven . Afraid to face the threat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank God Shirley Wasum had the decency to own up to his crime and thank God there 's no photograph to give continued impetus to the murmuring . It 's less onerous to be branded a liar than spineless . Perhaps by the time you return , some of the shame will have dissipated . " " But you ca n't really think ? " And then I stopped . He did think it . That 's what they all thought . I said , " Sir , I 'm sorry . But if that 's the way you feel , then I must bid you farewell forever , for I will not be returning at all . " " Do n't be foolish , boy . In a few months this will all ? " " No sir , I 'm not just a boy . I 'm near to grown . And if my own people have n't got any more faith in me than that , then I would n't care to come back . " " Nonsense , " he said . " You will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return home . And I trust you will keep in mind that until you are grown , obedience to ? " " No , I tell you , it 's farewell . " " Be quiet , " he said . " You 've already made one opprobrious mistake today . Do n't make another by speaking in anger words that you will later regret . " " I wo n't never regret it , " I said . " I ai n't never coming back , and I do n't care if you all rot with the leprosy . You could beg me to come back , but I wo n't . I 'll just keep going until I ? " He slapped me sharply across the face . It was not done in anger , for that was not his way , but just to stop my babbling . I winced and shut my mouth and did n't say another word . Neither did he . 23  | The store was very quiet . My father looked at me for a while , then turned to call to Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the family dispersed to the various Fairchild homes . It was always complicated , because a few lived right in town , but most , like us , lived out . After that , Uncle Raleigh came and banged me a few more times on the shoulder , looking even madder but saying nothing about my father 's slapping me or anything else . Calvin came , looking bothered , but saying nothing either , and a few dozen uncles and cousins came and stood in the way , also saying very little and trying to act as though nothing had happened , while I helped Calvin wipe the blood off his suit and helped him pack the big view camera and all those little bottles of chemicals . Among the uncles was Uncle Dawkins , and I finally opened my own mouth long enough to ask him to unlock the big store safe and give me the little sack that he held for me for safekeeping . " Your money sack ? " said Uncle Dawkins , not very happily . " What do you want that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's traveling might need some extra money . " " Yes , but traveling , you never know what kind of unsavory company you might fall in with . It 's tempting fate to carry money around . " " I expect I can look out for it all right , " I said , and the way I said it must have convinced him there was no jollying me out of the idea , and he handed over my sack . Then after that I went to Mrs. Idabelle Sealy 's to say goodbye to my grandmother , who was lying down in the best bedroom and who kept asking if we 'd kept ahold of the fried chickens and light bread she 'd packed for our lunch and lamenting that she had no dessert to send with us . Like Calvin , she did n't talk about Mr. Stein , and like the rest of the family , she did n't talk about what was foremost , by then , on my mind . And finally , after all that , I even found smiles for the kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their homes , and who kept on trying to act just everyday . They said things like , " Now , Pepper , you look after Calvin , and then hurry right  | back home , " and , " Pepper , do n't you be bringing some Indian bride back with you , you got to finish school before you get married . " Then the bugle blasted , signaling the stage 's approach , and people started looking expectant , and odds and ends of non-family came , clustering around the post office for letters that they hoped would be arriving . My Uncle Raleigh drew me aside . Uncle Raleigh was a big man , half a head above most of the Fairchilds , and we tended toward height . But then he was my dead mother 's brother , and not a Fairchild at all . For a time he did n't say much . The stage came , and people got out , and all our baggage was put on . Uncle Raleigh and I watched everything , and we watched the Fairchild part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him if he did n't write , and not to meet his own Indian bride along the way . The bugle blew again , and it was time to get on . Uncle Raleigh said , " Now listen to me , Pepper , I wo n't have you go to worrying just because folks . . . " I mumbled sullenly , " I ai n't got nothing to worry about . " " Of course you ai n't , " Uncle Raleigh said . " Is n't that what I 'm telling you ? Whatever you did or did n't do , I know you had the best reasons in the world for it , and that 's what I told the others . That 's the important thing , the reasons a man has for Iiisself . " " Yessir , " I said . ' Well , Pepper , " he said . " Well . Well , I reckon you and me are enough alike for you to be able to take on the world at fifteen . I was . " " Yessir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go until he banged my shoulder some mre , like getting hit by a bear , and hugged me . I hugged him hack . Calvin was staring around , looking anxious , until I got through all the Fairchild back-thumping and got on . That 's how we left . Like the kinfolk had told me , the four horses dashed down the street at a rapid gait . They said it would feel like my first ride on a fast train , a feeling of awe and fascination . I guess I was too numb to notice it . For my father 's words had 25  | told me only too clearly what all those odd expressions were saying , when the family looked at me . Poor Calvin . To think I 'd been worrying about associating with him in public , and to think that he was now being seen in public with me , Pepper Fairchild , the parish coward .  | Our train was filled with a small bunch of drunken drovers and a big bunch of Swedish and Iranian immigrant families going West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have riveted my attention , I was so distracted that I could scarcely heed them , even when the train would get up speed on straight stretches and the Swedish and Iranian people would commence wedging in babies so they would n't fall , and trying to find the conductor , and hollering . They hollered , opined a drummer for the Little O.K. Cast Iron Pig Trough , because in those times some people still had serious doubts whether the human body could withstand such high speed . By the time we parted with the drummer at Dallas , where Calvin and I changed to the Texas &; Kansas Railways , I had my own serious doubts whether the human ear could have withstood much more of his chattering . It was n't the drummer 's fault . He just liked to talk , and even though Calvin and I were both too inattentive to make a very good audience , we were about the only people he could find to talk English to . Calvin was preoccupied all through our threeday train trip , brooding about Mr. Stein I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again in my mind those lost moments when I had seen Otis Wasum with an apple and a rifle and had ruined my life . With my broody thoughts still back in Claiborne Parish and 27  | the loft of Uncle Dawkins 's store , I worked and worked and worked on that , and here 's what I worked out : I felt that I was no coward , and I felt it was beneath me to try to defend myself from unjustified charges such as that . What I did charge myself with , and therefore wanted desperately to prove untrue , was stupidity . I had done other stupid things before , jeopardizing my life , as all children will , but I and the other people had survived my stupidity , and this time others had not . I attributed my mistake wholly to stupidity  --  stupidity in assuming that all people follow the rules , because without rules and the willingness to follow them , there would be chaos . Naturally , I had been making all the standard resolutions : I would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible . And ten years from now , when I was successful and respected and quite probably famous ( not to mention a millionaire ) , everybody in Claiborne Parish ( to which word would , of course , get back ) would realize how sorely they had misjudged me . But why make them wait ten years if I could help it ? My first responsibility was to get Calvin to California , and by and by , while the immigrant people continued hollering and the drummer continued droning , I determined and resolved myself to the point that I could barely wait to get started on that chore , so the word could fly back to Claiborne Parish about how well I had done . It looked easy enough . All I had to do was to drive the mules for Cousin Calvin , as I have said , and advise him and not let him get in trouble , and deliver him to San Diego and the arms of Mr. John Swiss Parker , as the family had arranged . In turn , Mr. John Swiss Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written the family about who had assistants out beating around every town and settlement in southern California under the banner of " Phemister 's Photographs . " Once I got Calvin as far as San Diego , Mr. John Swiss Parker would take over the chore of advising him and helping him and keeping him out of trouble , and I would be free to turn my attention to the new life that , having ruined my old one , I was now embarking upon .  | So the first step was picking up the photographer 's wagon that had been arranged for Calvin in Denison City , Texas , en route to which I had learned , willy-nilly , that the Little O.K. Cast Iron Pig Trough could feed eight large hogs at a time , and that Denison City , which the drummer assured us he visited frequently , had two ice houses , a slaughterhouse , a cotton compressor , a Masonic Lodge , a Good Templar Lodge , a base ball club , four churches , five taverns , and an unknown number of faro banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer 's wagon , which was the one thing Calvin and I learned for ourselves . The train got to Denison City in midafternoon , not more than about an hour late , and Calvin and I were quick to climb off . We 'd accumulated a good coating of soot and cinders . The fried chickens Grandmother had sent with us had long since gone , and one of the two greasy meals they 'd had the nerve to charge a dollar a person for at the train stops had given us both a good case of the trots . The first thing we did was look around the depot and find a privy . The second thing we did was start out seeking a certain Professor Beuhlman , who was selling the photographer 's wagon . Where we ended up was the Ringer &; Johnson Hardware Company , for Professor Beuhlman had sold the wagon twice . This wagon part of Calvin 's new profession had been arranged in Minden , Louisiana , where a man engaged in a thriving photographer 's business had told one of the uncles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down permanently in Denison City and so was willing to sell at a bargain price his fully equipped , strictly high-grade portable studio and the mules that transported it . After the family had decided on Cousin Calvin 's future , correspondence was entered into and twenty-five dollars was sent on account , the balance to be paid upon inspection and acceptance of wagon and mules by Calvin and me . My father tended to the papers and the cashier 's check for the balance . He had made it clear that it was I who was to inspect and accept . I could advise with Calvin , but the responsibility was mine . I was glad to have this immediate , responsible deed to attend to . My spirits rose . I set about it almost cheerfully . 29  | Denison City was still a rough town then , and despite all its businesses and churches , no one had yet dug out all the stumps in the avenues left and right of Main Street . We walked up and down , looking for Professor Beuhlman 's place of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild to see and perhaps photograph some , and we were right on the south edge of Indian Territory . But we did n't turn up much more than some stray cows wandering along and a slew of what I strongly suspected were gay women flaunting about the streets . We finally asked at the marshal 's office . He told us that there had been a Professor Beuhlman in town , but he had sold out his atelier to a portrait- and view-taker named Mr. Lewels . The marshal directed us to him . We asked Mr. Lewels where was our wagon , and the most he could think of was that Professor Beuhlman had sold a wagon to the Ringer &; Johnson Hardware Company . He sent us there . By then , it was already coming clear to me what had happened , but Calvin would n't hear of going back to the city marshal . He was just anxious to find that wagon . At the Ringer &; Johnson Hardware Company , the first person we met was a Mr. Henry Ringer , a tall man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overalls pulled down and was inspecting a large bruise on his hip . He looked a little startled when I said , " Beg pardon . " He pulled up the overalls and said , " I got a little careless . I just got too close when a bunch of them mules was playing . That was n't a mean mule . " Well , we stated our business and he started looking grave . " Boys , " he said , " I bought what you might call a wagon from that Beuhlman fellow , and paid him fifteen dollars cash and got a signed bill of sale . " I said , " I guess you got a better price than we did , Mr. Ringer , for we Fairchilds advanced twenty-five dollars , with balance due on inspection . " " Beuhlman was in a considerable hurry , " said Mr. Ringer . " I 've known that to affect price . " Cousin Calvin 's face worked , and he said , " Pepper , ca n't we at least look at the wagon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see much . Calvin had a way of keeping his head down . To boot , from the time he had been old enough to have a beard he had grown an un-  | even mustache to try to hide where the upper lip was split . But every time he spoke , he gave himself away , and Mr. Ringer asked me , " What 's the matter with your friend ? " " Nothing , " I said . " He 's just fine . Mr. Ringer , would it put you out if we was to look at the wagon ? " " That wagon 's in a back lot , boy , " he said . " Come along and sec . He hollered to a little boy he called Roman to come point out the wagon 's location . We all followed Roman past a shed filled with barbed wire and a pile of rusting windmill parts and a stock pen to a fenced lot jammed full of old buggies and carriages and market wagons . Roman threaded us through to the southeast corner and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever seen . The body was longer than the average . In front was a spring seat and in back of that a little bench , both covered with a kind of canopy you usually saw on a surrey . In the back half of the wagon was a kind of big wooden box or small wooden room , about the shape and size of a privy . The whole thing was painted blue , somewhat faded from standing out in the weather , and lettered in gold on the privy part was " S. J. Boldini , Artist . " In smaller letters was " We Take Ranch Pictures . Family Groups a Specialty . " " Who in fire was S. J. Boldini ? " I asked . Mr. Ringer laughed . " Someone with a big family , I reckon . That wagon 's got seating space for six , if you squeeze a little , and standing space for four more . That 's the reason I bought it . It 's an investment . " I said carefully , trying to say it as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like you did n't buy anything but a scrap of paper , for Professor Beuhlman already had contracted it to us , and our contract date is bound to precede your sales date . " Mr. Ringer stopped laughing . " I do n't know what kind of contract you got , but a bill of sale is a bill of sale , and that 's what I got , " said he . " Yessir , " said I. " I wonder if you 'd care to walk over to the city marshal 's with us , for since you 've got papers and we 've got papers , this is for the law . " Calvin had scooted over to inspect the wagon . He succeeded 31  | in getting the door of the privy part opened . A strong odor of chemicals floated out . Mr. Ringer said , " Roman , I thought I told you to clean all that junk out of there . " " I started , " Roman said , calm as you please . " I hauled out two wheelbarrow loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoned and the trees all died . " " Did you dump it somewhere near ? " Calvin said . Roman looked puzzled and turned to me for interpretation . I repeated it . " Out next to the manure pile , " Roman said , gesturing to the rear of the lot . He grinned at me slyly . " That 's some wagon , " he said . " You know what they call it ? People come a-running every time they see it driving down the street and they say , What is it ? What is it ? ' So around here they call it the What's-It Wagon . " That 's supposed to be a fully equipped , traveling photographer 's studio , " I told him , a little stiffly . " And it looks to me like you 've been dumping out all its equipment . " Mr. Ringer said , " Now look here , boy , I bought that for a plain wagon , and it 's been occupying limited and much-needed space here in my lot for a wagon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the country right there across the Red River for settlement , I am going to sell that wagon for a wagon . " He stopped , then added as a kindly explanation to a stranger , " Boy , Denison City is the gateway to the Indian Territory , and when all of Denison is ready to move across the Red it 's going to need something to move in . And I 'm going to be ready for them . " As a business investment plan , it seemed to have its possibilities . Business investments were of considerable interest to me , and I looked impressed , which I was . But I said , " Mr. Ringer , if the federal government sends the word and those gates fly open , it would be a pity for you to be all tied up in court just then for selling a wagon on which a legally signed and sealed paper was drawn up by Judge Fairchild of Claiborne Parish , Louisiana , himself . " Mr. Ringer frowned . He said to Roman , " What you hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , and get ready to holler the minute a customer comes in . " All this time Calvin had been poking around inside the studio part of that wagon , and now he jumped down and came over to us , looking as gloomy as an overcast Sunday . I asked , " Have they broke up everything ? " Mr. Ringer said , " Now see here , that stuff was every which way and smelling to high heaven when that Professor Beuhlman came galloping in here with a wagon and mules he said he legal owned and legal was just dying to sell . Nobody here broke anything . " Calvin just looked sad . He was never one to argue . I said to Mr. Ringer , " I guess those mules would be the ones our paper covers . Two henny mules , one eight and one six years of age , near-black and with good dispositions . " " You ca n't hold paper on them mules , " Mr. Ringer said . It was a groan . He tried to recover . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 've been eating me out of house and home . Not to mention a fee for storing that sorry excuse for a wagon . Boy , somebody owes me one hell of a lot of money . " Well , I could see I 'd both made progress and slipped back . Mr. Ringer was a man who liked mules , that was plain , and Iuenny mules have been known to endear themselves to more than one man . Old Mr. Buck in our parish had a henny mule once , and he swore that the difference between a henny mule , which is born of a jenny donkey and a stud horse , and a regular mule , born of a jack donkey and a mare , is the difference between sweet spring and black winter , the hennys getting all the gtxid points of both blood lines , and the plain mule getting all the had . But I had Calvin 's face , turned to the ground to hide his split lip , before me , and it was clear to me that the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon first . I told Mr. Ringer , " I guess I 'll talk to my cousin here a couple of minutes . " " Talk away , " he said politely . " Talk about feed bills , while u 're at it . I guess I 've had those mules boarding out at my me place for nigh six weeks now . Oh , and you might talk ' bout Mrs. Professor Beuhlman . She showed up not long back from some place in Kansas . They tell me that 's the reason the 33  | professor and some yellow-haired gal with a store complexion he 'd been hanging around with left town so rapid-like . I guess maybe Mrs. Beuhlman 'd have some interest in the professor 's property . " We withdrew to a big manure pile at the back of the lot . Calvin was anxious to see if any chemical bottles or glass plates remained intact after Roman 's dumping . He got down in a ditch where we spotted glass , and I sat on the bank and tried to advise with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me like we 'd better get you straight on to California by some other means . That wagon 's a mess , and that Mr. Ringer 's got his hands on the mules that were to carry it . We can try the law , which he obviously would just as soon avoid , but it 's clear as day that he 's going to counter with a whopping board bill . The way I see it , you could send the papers back to the judge , and I guess if anyone could retrieve that advance money , he could . Then I 'll tell you what I think we ought to do . We 'll move on down the road to someplace that do n't think wagons is made of gold and buy a plain one cheap and be on our way . I 'd say take the train , but you 'd have to send home for more money , and I guess you would n't want to do that , now would you ? Besides , this way we 'll have our plain wagon to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain , but he ai n't here and I am , and you just write him that I took the responsibility for it . " Working carefully , for some of those chemicals used by photographic artists were poisonous , Calvin was looking among the pile of glass in the ditch for that which might be unbroken . He found one vial . It was empty , but he laid it on the grassy bank . Calvin said , " You 're not really saying we should make the trip without a proper photographer 's wagon , are you , Pepper ? " " Well , no , just for temporary , " I said . " Phemister 's Photographs expects you to show up with one , so we got to locate one for you . I 'll bet the family can write Mr. John Swiss Parker and he can run down a really proper one for you in California , quick as a wink , and it 'll be there waiting for you when you get there . You 'll see . " He worked on a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you ask me , that 's what they should have  | done in the first place . Maybe this one sounded cheap , but they was n't here to look at it , and I guess there 's Claiborne Parish Fairchilds that still has n't figured out that what you buy cheap can be just that  --  cheap and shoddy , not to mention sold twice over . Maybe I sounded a little bitter . Calvin looked at me and I looked at him , and he climbed out of the ditch and sat on the bank with me . The manure pile smelled pretty high , and there were bluebottles buzzing all about . We sat there brushing them off . After a while , Calvin said , " If you had three wishes , what would you really like to do in all the world , Pepper ? " " Make three million dollars , " I said . I guess I was short with him . It made me impatient , having Cousin Calvin act so **40;1133;TOOLONG with me , because I had always been about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch back and forth between pitying and despising Calvin , and we usually got along fine , at least when we were in private together . That 's when Calvin opened up with me and finally told me what he 'd been planning as his own secret all along . He said , " If I had three wishes , I 'd like to see a lot of pretty countryside going through the West and take views of it with my camera and e photographer 's wagon , and I 'd like to sell the views to the illustrated magazines in New York , and I 'd like to make enough money so I would n't have to go take charity from Granny 's kin in California . " I stammered , " Why , Calvin , that 's not charity to take help from kinfolk . " " Is n't it ? " he said . He looked straight at me . Calvin 's eyes were his one fine feature . They were shy and innocent , like a girl 's , but even the shyest girl would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel , not just a dull , flat hazel like many , but deep and splendid , with rays in them of an even deeper hazel , and those rays were speckled with gold . " Well , hell , Calvin , " I said . " Do n't cuss , " he said . " Pepper , if I had the nerve to try it without the family to back me up , maybe I could work just on my n , and not have to work for Phemister 's Photographs . I bet  | I could make ever so much more money just on my own , and then maybe I could help the family for a change . It 's always been a case of them helping me . I thought I had it licked when I tried schoolmastering , but you know how that turned out . " " But Granny 's kin is just going to help you get established , " I said . " And Phemister 's Photographs sounds a fine , steady job that you 'll be just crazy about . " Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's not a Fairchild that could . You 're like I 'd like to be . You 're independent . " Well , he had me there . But my responsibility was to deliver Calvin to California , and I knew clear as day what the parish would think if word got back to them that I 'd started out my successful and respected and quite probably famous new life by failing in my very first responsibility . So I side-stepped and said , " California sounds a grand place to go . You do want to go there , do n't you , Calvin ? " " Maybe for a time , " he said . His eyes got dreamy . " Maybe to look at it , and say thanks anyway to Mr. John Swiss Parker , and maybe by then to have some money to send back to the family . But would n't it be fine to be all on your own , maybe out where there 's still lots of open country and lots going on , like New Mexico or Arizona Territory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to manage , I 'd put you on the train in San Diego and then maybe double back . . . . Pepper , say , do you know what we could do ? If there was still plenty of time before school starts , you could double back with me , and we could take views coming and going and sell them . The train 's bound to stop somewhere in the territories , and you could head back from there .... Pepper , by then there 'd be even more money , and you could be the one to take it to the family , and you 'd say , Here 's money sent by Calvin to start paying back what was spent on him , and when it 's all paid back then he 'll just send more as a present . ' You 'd take my message , would n't you , Pepper ? After all , you and me , we 're partners . " Now this was just like Cousin Calvin . He would step right in the middle of horse manure every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always up on the clouds . I said , " I guess the only message anybody could send right now is , we got  | skinned , and we got no photographer 's wagon and no mules and tt sight less money than when we started . " " Oh , " Calvin said . He drew in his breath . I was sorry right away that I 'd hurt his feelings . I apologized , but Calvin said , " No , you 're right , Pepper . I guess I 'll never br anything but a damned fool . " " Why there 's not a word of that true , Calvin , " I said . " You 're as smart as anyone . As smart as me any day . " Then I gulped , remembering that it could perhaps be figured that I was not as smart as I had always thought , and I muttered , " Smarter . " Calvin looked at me worriedly . He had been so wrapped up with grieving about his true friend , Mr. Stein , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own secret aspirations to be independent and successful , that I did n't believe he 'd realized hilly what all had happened back in Claiborne Parish , and just how people looked at what had happened , and the spot that I 'd ut myself in . But I did n't want to start him to thinking about it . If the whole world considers you a fool , it 's nice to have at ast one person who has n't yet caught on . So I said , maybe . ending somewhat toplofty , " A person 's got to think of what can do before he can do it , or he ca n't realize his ambition , Ivin . You 've just got to make careful plans , that 's all . You 've t to be practical , and you 've got to plan things all the way . " " I guess I thought I had planned , " Calvin said wistfully . " Careful planning means finding out all the facts first , " I said . " I investigated that wagon pretty thoroughly just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people 'd stare at you , riding along in a thing kite that . You do n't want that wagon . " " I guess not , " he said . Well , he would n't say anything else . He just sat there shoog away the flies . It was exasperating , but I 'd already come ? n hard on him once and hurt his feelings , and I did n't want do that again . I said , " Do you really want that wagon ? " " No , no , " he said . " Old Roman gutted it like a chicken , " I said . " Just look at all those broken plates there in the ditch . " " Lots of the chemicals are still all right , " he mumbled . " You should have looked inside , Pepper . It 's got little shelves with  | shelf guards nailed all around the walls , and those bottles ride along just as snug as can be . And light-tight ? Not a speck of light comes in when you close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you notice that yellow-paned window ? " " I guess I was pretty busy listening to Mr. Ringer talk about feed bills and storage bills , " I said . Naturally , that shut Calvin up again , and I sat there , feeling worse and worse . Finally I said , " You know , Calvin , I guess it would n't really be such a bad idea to give your new profession kind of a trial run , so I 'm thinking on a compromise . " " I do n't want you to do anything you do n't think 's right , " Calvin said shyly . " No , what I 'm saying is , a careful man who finds out everything and makes good plans might do just fine to take a few views for the New York magazines and begin to learn how it 's done and all , and then maybe after a few years ' seasoning with Phemister 's Photographs in California he 'd be in a lot better shape to set up all on his own . Now do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . Without looking at me , he said , " I guess it sure does . " I watched him for a moment , feeling troubled , then said , " Listen , about Mr. Ringer , what do you think  --  we could put in fifteen dollars from our eating money , and sign over the check for the mules , and threaten him with the law if he says another word about board bills . There 's a man that hates lawing . You can tell just by looking at him . " " It would n't work , Pepper . We 'd still owe the balance on the wagon to Mrs. Professor Beuhlman . It would n't be right to cheat her . " That was Calvin for you . And that was the way it worked out . We had to pay a feed bill , too , though we got it down to seven dollars , and got skinned twice over on the mules , for Mr. Ringer could n't bring himself to part with the hennys and insisted we take two other mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charging us the full forty dollars apiece for them . He claimed that was dirt cheap for the then and the there , saying stock was at a premium because folks might be begging to buy at  | any price at any minute , the minute being whenever the Indian Territory was opened . I took time out to ask around at two livery stables , and found Mr. Ringer was not necessarily cheating on the price ; boomers were already making repeated attempts to colonize the Unassigned Lands , and stock prices were high . But this much is true : if it had n't been for the way Calvin 's poor ruined face looked when he told me he guessed he 'd never be anything but a damned fool , I 'd never have handed over that cashier 's check signed by our banker back home for such a broken-down-looking outfit . It all meant a lot of running about and looking all over the place for Mrs. Professor Beuhlman , and it took all day . We got our portmanteaus and the bundle of quilts and pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked them in the studio part of the wagon . Then we took the bench out of the front and curled in as best we could and slept there . We did n't eat dinner . The trots we 'd gotten back down the line were still telling on r stomachs . The next morning , Calvin sprang the rest of it on me , and ? rd came from home about another unexpected difficulty I ght be encountering in delivering Calvin to California : that me stinking snake , Otis Wasum . We heard about Otis in a egram from Uncle Raleigh . Here 's how things went : Calvin rolled out early , scrubbing and dusting and rattling ttles around in the back . I roused myself after a while and nt to look for Roman , because , not anxious to spend money another eating-house meal that just made you sick , I thought . get him to run home and give his momma twenty-five cents enough buttermilk and fried bacon and cornbread to keep going . But what do I encounter first but the local postmaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in his hatband , sane of them looking as though they 'd already seen a season or of rain . He was lost in Mr. Ringer 's back-lot empire between the barbed wire and the windmill parts . He 'd come to bring us telegram , and that was as far as he 'd managed to get . When he saw me , he looked relieved and said , " Excuse me. wonder if you could help me to locate a gentleman by the 39  | name of Mr. Pepper Fairchild ? I understand he 's living temporarily somewhere amidst this jumble of hardware items . " I told him I was Pepper Fairchild , and he looked surprised and said , " Ah . Good morning to you . The telegraph office sent this around to me last night , in that Professor Beuhlman no longer lives here , and I thought I 'd just drop it over to you . " And he held it out . Well , that was the first telegram ever sent to me , myself , in all my life , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh , thank you . " There were the words , written on the outside in a Spencerian hand , " Mr. Pepper Fairchild , care of Prof. A. B. Beuhlman , Denison City Township , Texas . " " How the devil does one get out of here ? " the postmaster said . " Uh , right up this way , " I said . Once he saw daylight through Mr. Ringer 's front door , he seemed content for me to drop behind , and I unfolded the message to read : " My God , " I gasped , though I was n't sure why , for the sense of Uncle Raleigh 's telegram was n't fully apparent . But I turned and ran back to the wagon , and what does Calvin do just then but exit from the studio part of the vehicle wearing a clean shirt and his traveling suit all brushed and saying to me , " Pepper , it 's been a long trip and you need to rest up , so you just take it easy and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talking about ? " I said . " Look here . Uncle Raleigh sent me this genuine telegram . " Calvin took it from my outstretched hand and read it , looking all at sea . He studied it so long that I said , " It says Otis has went and , 40  | ' Keep eyes peeled . ' Maybe Uncle Raleigh thinks Otis is going to follow us . " " What would Otis want to do that for ? " " Calvin , he 's crazy . You should have heard the way he talked ? keep quiet or I 'll kill you , and stuff like that . That was later , after it was all done . " " And Shirley ? " " Well , I do n't rightly understand the whole telegram . It says Shirley escaped him . I do n't know who ' him ' is . " " Maybe it means him and Otis has went . But why would Shirley follow us ? " " Hell , Calvin , I do n't know everything . I just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although surely Uncle Raleigh would have mentioned it . Or maybe Uncle Raleigh thinks they 're going to follow us and engage us in a show of arms . " Calvin 's mouth began to work , and after a while he got out , " I fear that would make sense . If they 're dead set on some dark vendetta , the best way would be to come at the two weakest members of the family . " That riled me . " We are n't by any sense the weakest members , " I said crossly . " No , no , I just mean we 're Fairchilds , and we 're off alone . We 're off where they can get at us , not back in the bosom of the family like the others . Besides , you 're the judge 's son , and since you licked Otis in that little fracas you had , maybe he 's mad enough to think you 'd be a tempting target to start a vendetta . " Well , that cooled me down some , Calvin 's saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Just let Otis poke his nose around here and see what he gets . Shirley , too , if they 're together . " By that time I had noticed his suit . I said , " Where in fire are you going ? " " Uh , I 'm going to find work for a day or two , " he said . " I 'm hoping that Mr. Lewels who bought Professor Beuhlman 's atelier can use a hand . " The only time Calvin had ever worked , and not just at Uncle Dawkins 's store or farming or helping others of the family , was the year he tried schoolmastering , and the way even the smallest kids cut up when he tried to teach them was something the parish still talked about . I said , " Now Calvin , that Mr. Lewels 41  | did n't look any too prosperous when we talked to him yesterday , and I did n't exactly see folks flocking in to sit for their portraits . He needs help just about as much as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , then , I 'll ask around for something else to work at , " Calvin said . " What in the world for ? What did we spend all our money for yesterday but a traveling photographic studio ? There 's your work standing right there , painted pukey blue . " " Yes , well , there 's a little problem in that , " Calvin said . I sat down on the edge of the wagon . I folded the telegram carefully . While I was very pleased with Uncle Raleigh for sending one to me , its contents seemed more puzzling than spectacular , and the Calvin problem took precedent . " Tell it to me quick , " I said . He mumbled so , I had to ask for it louder , and it came out : tin plate for ferrotypes and more glass plate for ambrotypes and nitrated cotton and potassium iodide and pyrogellic acid and albumen paper and a bunch of other stuff I could n't even pronounce . Roman had done a fine job of dumping with his two wheelbarrows full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases too old and in other cases dried up , and the supplies Calvin brought with him would not stretch far , and I finally stuffed my fingers in my ears . " Please , Pepper , " Calvin said , trying to unstuff them . " Please , now . It 'd take all our eats money and then some . And like you said , we ca n't send home for money . Not this soon , when we have n't even started yet . " He looked around the wagon lot uneasily , maybe already keeping his eyes peeled , and went on , " Now , all I have to do is work awhile , and we 'll find you a good safe place to stay , and pretty soon I can buy the things I need to make photographs . Then we can hit the trail and it 'll be clear sailing , for I can make all the money we 'll need by selling lots of views . We 'll just hurry up a little on the way to California . Or Pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me all the way . If it gets near school time , we can just put you on the train wherever we are . " There he went again . But I tried to control myself . I said , " Calvin , did n't you listen to me about planning ? Even if I was  | interested in catching some train , what would we use for money buy the ticket ? You know as well as I it 's being sent to Mr. John Swiss Parker in San Diego so it would n't get robbed off w along the way . " " Well , by then I 'll have made plenty of money for the train , " : Ivin said . " Pepper , listen . Pepper , do n't you believe me ? Pepper , you got to believe me . You 're my partner . " " I ai n't , " I shouted . " I 'm what was being sent to see that you .. t to California without doing some damn-fool thing to dis ? cc the family ! And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going back to Claiborne Parish anyway ! I 'm gog to look for me a sound business opportunity in the West , d when I find it I 'm going to set to work and I 'm going to make ? re money than any damned Fairchild has ever seen , and you Grandmother can come visit me any time you want , but I m't care if I never see any other stay-at-home , let-the-worldrun over-you , hungry Fairchild , haughty Fairchild , damned Fairchild again ! " " Do n't cuss , " Calvin said . In a little while , he added , " No Fairchild 's ever gone hungry . " I said sullenly , " In the seventies we did . Granny said so . " " Everybody was hungry then . Things were bad then , worse than the war . But the state 's straightened up considerably . " " There 's not a Fairchild still has anything , " I said . " A little A little farm . Being county judge . What 's that to be so ud about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just settled , " Calvin said . " That 's bad enough , " I said . " They do n't know things are changing . They do n't even know there 's money can be made in this country . I 'll tell you something now . I 'll tell you the truth ? ! do n't think there was a single Fairchild in Claiborne Parish that even wanted the sawmills to come in . " Calvin sighed . " I guess they liked the trees , " he said . " So did Otis Wasum and his folks , " I said . That was about ninety things in a row I should n't have said . Certainly I had n't meant to let anything slip about my private feud with my father until I had my future all set up and ready ip . o , much less tell it in a way that would hurt Calvin . But I 'd so much now that Calvin started looking sore-troubled. 43  | He said , " Pepper , what 's happened ? A week in the smokehouse , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't always see he 's being too strict , and that 's no reason in the world to run away . " Who 's running ? " I said . " Going off on your own is n't running . " " Well , but then maybe he was n't so wrong wanting to stay away from trouble with the Wasums . That Otis and Shirley . It worries me , your Uncle Raleigh 's telegram . Maybe Otis is just a poor , crazy boy , but Shirley , now , Shirley could be downright tough to tangle with . " I growled , " I 'm not scared of either of them for one minute , if that 's what you think , and there ai n't nothing at all to worry about . " " I know you ai n't scared , " Calvin said . He blinked at me , searching , trying to feel his way into things . He said , " Pepper , you got to go home in the fall . Just because the judge made you spend a week in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so riled I felt ready to howl . " That 's one little bitty thing , and I 'm talking about lots and lots of things . Now the straight of it is , the judge and I have never got on , and I 'll tell you , Calvin , I 'm . . . I 'm seceding . If we could secede from the Union over State 's Rights , why then I guess I can secede from the family over Pepper Fairchild 's Rights . " " I see , " Calvin said . He turned his eyes full at me , seeing . " Then I guess this is the first time in my life I 've ever been sorry I bear the name I do , for that must mean that you aim to secede from me , too . " And then we just sat there , silent . After a while I felt so bad that I did the only thing I could . I went around to the little wooden room on the back of the wagon and got my portmanteau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my clean drawers . I said to Calvin , " I spoke things wrong just now . We 've always been more than even kin , we 're true friends , too , and I aim that we always will be . This here is to prove it . " And I reached the hat from his head and dumped the sack in it . It was money , mostly silver dollars , but more than one gleaming gold piece was there . It looked impressive to me just as it 44  | was , and I did n't bother to open the little package of greenbacks I 'd wrapped in a piece of oilcloth . Well , Cousin Calvin was flabbergasted . He said , " Pepper , what is this ? Wherever did you get all that money ? " " It 's mine , every nickel . That 's what I meant by being practical and making a plan . See this big old silver dollar with the X mark ? I sold a barrow to John Murphey that I raised from a little shoat Uncle Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he pretty looking ? ? I got him for milking for old Mr. Buck all one winter . This is money I saved . " " What did you save it for ? " " I told you , for a sound business opportunity . I used to think maybe as soon as I was grown I might invest my pile in getting the Dorcheat made navigable as far as Sike 's Ferry , for surely s body who controlled such a waterway could make money Fiore . But now that I 'm not going back to Claiborne Parish , do n't doubt that some fine opportunity in the West will be more profitable by far . Like I told you , a man 's got to plan ahead if he wants to make things work . A man wants to make money , he 's got to have money to invest when the right opportunities come along . Well , the way I see it , I 've found my first opportunity . Whatever of this money we need for photographic stuff , Calvin , we 'll just spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin 's face got red as a cardinal 's tail . He said , " I ca n't tell you how proud you make me , Pepper . But we ca n't spend money you 've worked and saved so hard for . " " Sure we can , " I said . " Partner . " Cousin Calvin sat and looked at me so long that I got a little embarrassed . Then he stood up and reached for my hand and shook it up and down , up and down , just as if I 'd been a grown man . His mouth worked so hard it looked like the words would never come out , but he made it at last : " I promise I wo n't fail you . Partner . " 45  | So we headed West , neither of us saying any more , in the Fairchild way , about either our private aspirations or about Uncle Raleigh 's telegram , but both of us keeping our eyes peeled . My little sack was considerably lighter after Calvin bought the things he needed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family had figured would take us all the way to California barely got us out of Denison City . Calvin was n't a bit worried . At first . Leaving Denison City promptly was my idea , of course . A problem we both knew well , and which was why the family had decided on California for Calvin in the first place , was that around our parts any town big enough to support a full-time photographer already had one . In Denison City , for instance , there was already Mr. Lewels trying to scrape a living . So I told Calvin , Mr. Lewels just sits there in town , but what about the country folks ? And I reminded him of Phemister 's Photographs always out making rounds and about the lettering on the wagon , " We Take Ranch Pictures . " So two mornings later , when we had everything as ready as it would ever be , I clucked up the mules , Old Jeb and Young Jeb , and we set off looking for ranches . The first thing we found was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little children , some white but mostly black , come down from slaves who 'd belonged to the Indians , were chasing  | after us and staring in wonder , not at Calvin for a change , but at the strange appearance of the What's-It Wagon . One tiny little girl with peppercorn hair fell down and began crying so hard that Calvin finally told me I 'd better stop so he might look at her . The tramp came out from among some live oak trees , on one of which he had just nailed up a big white reward notice that said in big black letters : $1,000 REWARD WHEREAS , in the vicinity of the municipality of Denton , Denton County , Texas , within the last seven weeks , three men have been murderously slain and robbed , and WHEREAS , the names of these aforesaid three slain men are as follows : JASON WALLER JIM LONGINO JOHN THOMAS BLANCHARD and WHEREAS , I , HamiIcar B. Burr , Merchant and citizen of said municipality of Denton , Denton County , Texas , being in shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help our fair town free itself of the malignant presence of these cursed and most abominable murderers and robbers , and wishing to do my duty to my town , my county , my state , and my God , THEREFORE do I hereby offer a reward of $1,000 for the capture , alive , of the men , principal participants in the aforesaid crimes , said sum to be paid in addition to any rewards from county or state or others . HAMILCAR B. BURR First the tramp squatted down and spoke to Calvin , and they talked a minute , and then he came over to me.  | " Beg pardon , " said he , " but I do n't believe I made myself understood to your friend there . " Well , I could see why . People who did n't know Calvin sometimes found him hard to understand , but there was nothing the matter with this young man 's mouth and I still could barely make him out . " What can we do for you ? " I said when I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you 're going toward Sherman , and I wondered if I might ride along with you . " That 's how I knew he was a tramp . He not only talked peculiarly , but he was willing to ask for a ride in a wagon that , if we 'd been back home , I would frankly have been ashamed to be seen in . I said , " Sir , I fear we ca n't help you , as my cousin is a photographic artist , and we 'll be stopping at every ranch along the way for him to take portraits . " " That 's all right , " the young man said . " I need to stop along the way myself . I 'm supposed to nail those posters up . " He pointed . " See ? " He waited until I looked at the poster again , then he said cheerfully , " Mr. Burr is paying me two pennies apiece to put them up , and there were a hundred posters . His agent provided the nails and a hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammer when I 'm through ? What do you suppose a good hammer 's worth ? It 's quite a good hammer . " At least that 's what I thought he said . I 'd never encountered an accent so thick . Calvin joined us before I could make out enough of it to essay a reply , and the man turned to him and asked in his cheerful voice , " Well , sir , and did you get that little Limbo patched up ? " " She just skinned her knees a bit , " Calvin said . So there we were , with the tramp not able to understand Calvin 's speech , and me hardly able to understand his , and by the time we got it all cleared up , Calvin was asking the man politely to take his seat in the wagon , up front on the spring seat , and Calvin would sit on the bench behind us . They wasted a lot of time jawing about that , neither quite understanding the er from the looks of it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack from among the live oaks and jumped up , lively , to the wagon . He took the bench . At least he was mannerly . He scrunched himself forward and said , " May I introduce myself ? Gilmore Carmichael . Please consider me at your service . " " Mr. Calvin Fairchild , " said I , nodding at Calvin , " and I 'm Pepper Fairchild . " " Brothers ? " the tramp said . " No sir . Cousins . " ' Well it 's certainly a pleasure , " he said . " I 'm in your debt . Those posters are heavy as sin . " " How come they 're wanting them posted way up here ? " I asked . " Denton . That 's sixty or eighty miles south , is n't it ? " " About fifty , I believe . Hamilcar B. Burr must be papering the countryside with them . " " You from these parts , Mr. Carmichael ? " I asked . He enjoyed a merry laugh over that . " Do I sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time in Texas , and I 'm not sure I know yet just how they sound . Except they sound different from home . " " I 'm British , " the tramp said . " I 've been in your country , oh , perhaps a little over a month . " So that explained why he sounded so funny . He began asking us where our home was and all about the photographic business . After a while , we could understand him a lot better , just as he got the hang of Calvin 's speech , and they passed the time of day together . He popped questions like a string of firecrackers and soon had Calvin telling him about us being hard on the road to San Diego , California , and I was relieved to hear Calvin even go so far as to mention Mr. John Swiss Parker and Phemister 's Photographs . In turn , the tramp told Calvin he was contemplating a " ramble to a town called Tombstone in the Arizona Territory , wherever that is , " and Calvin schoolmastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy themselves . I was busy mainly with the mules . Young Jeb did n't harmonize well yet , and Old Jeb was having to work hard keeping him in step . Ordinarily , I guess not many things could be nicer than 50  | traveling like we did along a strange road , through rolling land , with big groves of live oak turning up often enough to break sun glare and monotony , and the wagon rattling and the trace chain jingling and Mr. Carmichael , who put on no more airs than someone from back home and early asked us to call him Gil , jumping out every so often to nail up a poster and then running back to leap on the wagon . He was grown , of course , maybe even a little older than Calvin , who was twenty-six , but he ran like a boy . He would have looked like one , too , except for the kind of beard that results not from design but from not shaving often . He was light of build and short . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I intended to grow plenty more before I called it quits . For the rest , he was fair of hair , which could have used trimming , with gray eyes that had a lot of laughter in them . Why he was nailing up reward notices for two cents apiece he did n't say , and naturally we did n't ask . But we did n't run across any ranches , and I began to get worried . There was just a poor-looking farm here and there . Calvin was obviously getting worried , too , for he finally asked the question of Gil . " As you 've been putting up posters around , mayhap you know this part of the country , " Calvin said , " and could tell us when we start getting into the ranching area . It 's ranches we 're specializing in today . " " I 'm afraid I could n't say , " Gil said . " The most I 've heard in Denison City is that a lot of the niggers that came over the line from the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine these are all just Chino or Zambo farms . " " What 's the difference ? " Calvin asked . Gil looked at us quizzically , as though he thought we should know even better than he , but he said , " According to Tschudi 's list of half-castes , a Chino is a cross between an Indian father and a Negro mother , and a Zambo between a Negro father and an Indian mother . Or is it the other way around ? I read dozens of tour guides to your America . It all runs together in the mind . " I said , " Do they really come out different ? " " Well , naturally the male defines the bloodline , " Gil said . " Is n't that so ? Although , now that I think of it , I 'm not sure what Mr. Darwin would say . "  | " Who 's Mr. Darwin ? " I asked . " Well . . . " Gil said . " A scientist , " Calvin put in . I said , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , say , like henny and plain mules ? " " What ? " Gil said . " Never mind for now , " Calvin said . " What say we turn in at the next farm and try our luck ? " Gil laughed his hearty laugh . " Surely you 're not planning to take portraits of niggers , " he said . " Oh , we have lots of niggers in our home parish , " Calvin said , " and I imagine they might like portraits as well as anybody else . " Gil 's face reflected a sort of mental blink . " You know , I think you 're absolutely right . They 'll probably like it immensely , " he said , and he jumped down to tack up another reward notice . So we tried the next farm . By chance it was white , though it looked as poor as the others . There was an old grandmother boiling the wash in the front yard , and she called off the dogs and a half-dozen children that came running out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you 're looking for Zwing . " Calvin gave me a pleading look . I handed him the lines and stepped down . Gil just sat on the bench in the wagon and looked on with lively interest . " Ma'am , " I said , " this is Mr. Calvin Fairchild , photographic artist , and we 're here to offer you a special opportunity to have four permanent , lasting ferrotypes on tin at the rate of one dollar for all four , of you or your pretty grandchildren here or your husband 's barn or any horses or cows your husband might especially prize . " " Do n't you want to see Zwing ? " the grandmother said uncertainly . " He 's just gone out hunting with Hugh . He 'll be back most any time . " " Well , no ma'am , " I said . " It 's you we wanted to see . " She eyed Calvin and Gil and the wagon . " Which one is S. J. Boldini , Artist ? " she said . It turned out she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , so Gil jumped off the wagon . " Madame , I have that honor , " he said . He bowed . " And this is my illustrious colleague , Mr. Fairchild. "  | She could n't make out a word of it , I would have bet . But she commenced to patting her hair a bit . " A dollar , " she said , at length . " A dollar , now , that seems mighty high . " " For four permanent photographs on tin ? " Gil said . " Tintypes that you would treasure all your life ? Tintypes that would occupy a place of honor in what I 'm sure is a charming little parlor there in your charming home ? " Frankly , I felt that I should be doing the talking , because maybe if they were washed up the lady 's grandchildren could be called pretty , but a two-room shack with a dogtrot in the middle of it is not what you could stretch to call a charming home . But , then , she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bow Gil made her when he claimed to be S. J. Boldini . " Well , a dollar does seem high , " she said . " You children , you come away from that wagon , now ! " " That 's no ordinary wagon , ma'am , " I said quickly , before Gil could horn in again . " That 's a fully equipped , traveling photographer 's studio . " " Just fancy , " the grandmother said . She cast a glance at her boiling wash , and called to one of the children , " LaFay , come stir those shirts ! " I said , " Naturally , Mr. Fairchild produces the tintypes right on the spot , and you do n't have to wait and wait before you can enjoy them . " " Well , " she said . We had her . I said , " Mr. Fairchild will just get out his fine fifty-dollar camera and get everything all prepared , and you can go get ready , for of course the first portrait will be made of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Do you think I want my portrait made in some old thing I put on to do the wash ? " " Mr. Fairchild would n't dream of rushing a lady , " I said . Now , I expect you 'll want a fine portrait of your grandchildren ere for the second tintype . What about the barn ? Does your husband especially prize that barn ? " It took nearly an hour . Impossible to understand him or not , the grandmother had to consult with " Mr. Boldini " to decide what all she wanted four tintypes of , and I guess maybe she caught a word here and there . She settled on Hugh Junior stand-53  | ing holding a half-bred Jersey in front of the barn for one picture , and herself on the gallery in her black Sunday best for the second , and a young woman raked up from somewhere with a brand-new baby for the third , and the grandchildren and the young woman and her all together for the fourth . She wanted to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in , too , but " Mr. Boldini " talked her out of it . Calvin did fine . He prepared the tin plates and made the pictures and then popped into that little privy-looking room and popped back out later with the tintypes , not mounted or framed , but what did they expect for a dollar ? The whole family waved until we were clear out of sight . Down the road a little distance , I said to Gil , " Excuse me , " and I handed Calvin the silver dollar the grandmother had handed me . He turned it over a time or two , just beaming , then handed it back . " You 're the one with the business sense , " he said . " You keep it for us , partner . " As treasurer , I was not exactly weighed down by the business we did during the rest of that day . Not that we did n't do any more business . We never did find a real ranch , but we turned in on a place owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Calvin was kept as busy as you please taking portraits of a tribe of Polled Angus bulls and heifers . The catch was , Mr. Robert M. Burgess had no cash and paid us off in salt beef . The lack of cash held pretty much through the day . Evening found us still a piece away from Sherman and rounding up , for the second time , three white Leghorn pullets that a recently married couple had exchanged for a portrait in their wedding clothes . We had locked up the chickens in the privy part of the wagon . Every time we opened the door , they flew out cackling . The light would soon be failing . Old Jeb was tired from trying to keep the young mule in step all day , and I said to Calvin after we 'd asked at the last farm and been turned away , " Maybe we should start thinking of stopping for the night . " He looked , longingly I thought , toward a line of trees that told us we were coming to a creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon  | we could push on and get to Sherman tonight . Gil is probably anxious to get on in . " I le could have added , " To get paid for nailing up posters , " but of course he did n't . But Gil mind-read Calvin as well as I did . He said , " There 's nothing in Sherman I 'm anxious to do . My paymaster , Hamilcar II , Burr , awaits me all the way down the route in Denton . Mr. Burr seems a careful businessman , and my wage depends on an agent due to ride from Denison City to Denton on Friday . mong the duties of the agent is to count the posters he sees ? ng the way . Otherwise , I assure you I would have thrown em all in the nearest ditch . " Calvin laughed , no doubt thinking Gil did n't mean it , and " Then do you mind camping out overnight ? If there 's anying pretty enough ahead , I 'd love to get set up and take some views while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alagazine uses no end of western views . " I did n't comment , but it did n't seem to me we were West enough yet to start wasting plates . Texas looked different from 1r home parish , all right , but the main difference was oak incad of sweet gum , bois d'arc instead of cypress . And it did n't m sensible to me that New York magazines would pay money r such as that . The place I picked out for us on the creek was already occupied . A family with two big girls , one with black hair who looked d about my age , had pulled a wagon in and were scouting out the site as though they were figuring on stopping early , just like us . Gil said , " Wait a minute . " He jumped out of our wagon and ran to a tree and commenced nailing up one of his reward posters . The man of the family went and studied it . The girl with black hair came over to me . I noticed she had her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . She said , " What in the ever-loving world do you call that kind of a wagon ? " " I guess you 've never seen a high-grade traveling photogpher 's studio before , " I said . She giggled . " No , and I 've never seen a chicken with two heads , either . But I saw a hog eat a just-born calf once . " They were from Missouri . The man called the black-haired 55  | girl over to read the poster out loud to him , then he came and said , " Evening , " to Calvin and me and had the girl read our wagon . " Traveling , I see , " the Missouri man said to us . " Yessir , " I said , " all the way to San Diego , California . " " You following the Butterfield ? " That was the old Butterfield Overland Mail route . Its stages had n't run since early in the war , when the federal congress annulled its contract , but many travelers heading West still followed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri man , ' We plan to do so . Folks said that was about the easiest way . " That 's what folks said to us . We been passing lots of wagons going West , but not no wagons like this . " He studied the gold lettering a bit more , then said , " What kind of artist ? " " My cousin , Mr. Calvin Fairchild , is a photographic artist , " I said . He nodded awhile . He jerked his thumb back toward Gil 's poster and said , " What kind of robberies ? " " That I could n't say , " I said , " for we 're new to this part of the world . " " Three men ? " he said . " All killed ? " " That 's what the poster says . " The Missouri man said , " Three men . I never saw a notice quite like that . They gave each of them a line to hisself . " " Yessir . " " Butchered and robbed and left to blowflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all that . " He nodded a bit more , then seemed to make up his mind . " Well , I guess we 'll be going on in to Sherman for the night , " he said . " I wish you good evening . " Of course we wished it in return . Then we exchanged the expectation of encountering one another along the Butterfield . Then they picked themselves up and were gone in five minutes . The black-haired girl craned her neck and looked back at us , but she did n't wave . So neither did I. Gil looked about him , smiling . I said , " I think you did that on purpose . " " What ? " said he .  | " Nailed up that murder poster right under those folks ' noses . Me agent that 's coming Friday , he 'll never be able to count a poster so far back in the trees . " " You think not ? Then I suppose that will just have to be my Contribution to our evening 's comfort . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started clucking and saying of course Gil had n't frightened people away on purpose , and Gil started teasing that surely had looked a lot at the black-haired girl , and I stomped ' and left both of them . I took the mules with me , to water cm . Well , there was good grass around , though we 'd brought corn the mules to carry along from Denison City . I let them roll , then wiped them down and staked them out to graze for a while . the time I got through , Calvin was down by the bridge making squares with his fingers as if he was contemplating taking a view of just the plain old trees . Gil was getting up firewood , whistling and bustling around . He 'd already dragged the barrel ofsalt beef from where I 'd put it behind the bench , just as if it belonged to him , and he asked if we had matches , saying he it seemed to have lost his from his pack . I opened the wagon 's privy part , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying out again . " Catch them ! Catch them ! " Gil cried . " I 'd like to know how , " I said . All three flapped into a tree . They were gabbling with wild excitement . Gil climbed up the tree as lithe as a monkey and soon had m all shaken out . I captured them on the ground . Calvin came up from the creek bed and helped . " I wonder , " said Gil , when he was back on solid ground , " if menu should n't read chicken tonight instead of salt beef . " Now , those were Calvin 's chickens . I had some investment them , too , it should be remembered . But there was Mr. Gilmore Carmichael , casually disposing of them . He did , too . Calvin readily agreed with him that chicken would be fine , just as if were back home and Gil was a visitor that you tried to offer anything you could think of to please him . I 'd certainly been taught manners enough to know that hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to see that it was something 57  | you killed yourself over for any tramp who asked for a ride and then stayed with you the entire day . To make matters worse , Gil had never killed a chicken before and looked squeamish about starting , and Calvin was anxious to take a view by the creek that he thought would be pretty . It was Pepper Fairchild , of course , who ended up having to kill and scald and pluck those pullets . By the time the sun went down and the mosquitoes came up , I 'd fried those chickens as best I could . They did n't taste like Grandmother 's , but they were n't bad . Gil ate hungrily . Then he rummaged in his pack and found cigarette makings , which he shared with Calvin and , I had to admit , politely enough offered me , and we settled back on our quilts and watched the stars come out . Gil showed me Jupiter , which he said had moons just like our moon and a big red patch on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wondered out loud for a while if it might be a real world , like ours . Then Gil sighed and said , " How marvelous . A marvelous meal and a marvelous day . This is the kind of day you can remember all your life . " " It 's been a right fine day , " Calvin agreed . " It would have been a sight finer if we had more cash money to show for it , " I said . " Salt beef and pullets is n't going to pay for all the photographic chemicals we 've been running through . " " We 'll soon be into real ranching country , " Calvin said . " We 'll make cash money there . " " I do n't know that I 'd count on that , " Gil said . " If I were you , I believe I 'd concentrate more on the small settlements and towns . That 's where one would expect money in any region to accumulate . " " But ranch pictures , now , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Boldini must have made money at them or he would n't have specialized in them . " " I only know what happened to a friend of mine , " Gil said . " Actually , I suppose that 's why I 'm here . His family owned a cattle run , you see . " We had to stop and work on that , and it finally turned out that a cattle run was British for cattle ranch , which Gil 's family 's friend , named Mr. Frederick Fassnidge , had somewhere near I 58  | the upper reaches of the Brazos River . When Gil found himself short of funds in a foreign country it occurred to him that he could do worse than look up good old Freddie . This required additional backing up , for I was naturally curious to know which foreign country , which turned out to be America , which I had certainly never heard called foreign before . Then , since he had brought up the subject himself , it seemed all right to ask , and I asked why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I started with adequate funds . My aunt gives me little dribblings of money , you see , to stay out of Manchester . That 's where my father lives . " " Where 's Manchester ? " I said . " I 've only ever read of London . " " Then you have a rough idea of Manchester . It 's a good bit northwest of London , but they 're just alike . Great , dirty places ith sprawling suburbs . " He laughed his merry laugh . " I 'm always glad to leave , but my aunt does n't know that yet , and I assure you I 'll never tell her . " Talking about his family like that with non-family like us Made me uncomfortable , and I said , thinking to change the subt , " I guess you like traveling a good deal . " It turned out later he 'd been just about everywhere , all over ' . urope and once even to India , but that night he only said , " Sometimes . I 've enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Just New Orleans , and now Texas . " Gil glanced at me and aid , " How old are you , if you do n't mind my asking , Pepper ? " " Fifteen , " I said . " Why ? " " That 's old enough , " he said . " I 'll tell you what I did . I took ship this time from Liverpool to New Orleans . I did n't want to go to New York City . I have an idea New York City is just like London , and I do believe I 've concluded that the only fit life for a man is the rural life . " " Calvin here 's been to New York City , " I said . " He 's also been to a nearby place named Coney Island , and they have a hotel there that 's shaped like an elephant . Tell Gil about that hotel , Calvin . " " Another time , " Calvin said politely . " Just now I 'd like to hear Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you 've been there , " Gil said . " Not yet , " I said . " The fartherest I 've ever been before was to Bay Tree , Arkansas , where Calvin and I once sold two overweight bales of cotton . Bay Tree looked pretty much like our home town . What 's New Orleans like ? " " I hardly know . I was only there overnight . I went to a whorehouse and got dosed down with laudanum in a whiskey smash . When I came to on the docks the next morning I did n't even have the money left to pay my hotel bill . So I smuggled my belongings out and left . Fortunately , I do n't think I got dosed down with anything else . I 'd been wondering . " " Uh , " Calvin said , looking quickly at me , " and that 's why you decided to look up Mr. Frederick Fassnidge ? " " Yes , my sisters said he had written last from a place called Dallas , and it did n't seem too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramble over there . " " Kind of a far ways to ramble , " I said . " So it was . And then Freddie turned out to be as strapped for ready-money as I was , although I must say he 's going to be immensely wealthy August eleventh . " " What 's so special about August eleventh ? " I said . " Why , he 's got in on this marvelous mining enterprise , the Arizona Consolidated Mining Company . I 'm sure you 'll keep this confidential , but you see , they 've struck water in Tomb-stone ! " " Oh , " I said . " Water ? " Calvin said . " Yes , Freddie tells me the town has absolutely none of the stuff . It 's filthy with silver and gold , but they have n't even enough water for a stamping mill and they have to haul the ore , oh , who knows how far to be worked . " He laughed , enjoying some private joke , and went on to tell us how Freddie had traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shaft in some mine called the Sulphuret and install big steam pumps every hundred feet to pump up water that had appeared at the Sulphuret 's five-hundred-foot level . Then they 'd mine the Sulphuret for silver , sell water for a stamping mill , and sell any excess for irrigation , turning the desert into a garden .  | " I had a chance to get in on it myself , " Gil said cheerfully , " but I. seem to have muffed it . You see , the pumps will arrive August tenth , and they wo n't be able to keep things quiet after that . The stock price will soar . One could make quite a nice little profit by buying on August ninth and selling on the eleventh . That 's what Freddie recommends . I know I do n't have to ask you not to repeat this , but Freddie has private information that the supply of water is not unlimited , you see ? They 've let the word get around that the water comes from a flowing underground stream , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I suppose they 'll use it all up in a year or two . Leave it to Freddie to know how to skin the natives . I le 's devilishly clever about financial things . I suppose I should n't repeat this either , but the ranch he 's unloaded on his partners is rather useless . The ranch had all gone to hell since your Slave War , you see ? " Now , I felt a little rankled , partially because I suspected I was one of the " natives " that Freddie knew so well how to skin and partially because being devilishly clever about financial t h ings was what I wanted to be , and I envied anyone who already was . So when Gil said , " Slave War , " I said grouchily , " Our what ? " although of course I knew what he meant . Calvin said to Gil , " We do n't call it just that . " " Oh , " Gil said . " I beg your pardon . " " That 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Between the States , and some say the War for Southern Indepcndence . In the North they call it the Civil War or the Rebelhon . I guess Rebellion fits pretty well . The South denied that the North had the right to curtail its freedom just for the sake of unity , so it seceded . " Calvin never even looked at me , but Gil did , with a puzzled look that I was coming to be familiar with . " Well , " Gil said . " Well , the Fassnidges were rather slow in getting around to looking into their ranch after , er , your war , and Freddie found it absolutely oozing with interlopers when he cone out to see to it . They would n't even let him on the place when he tried to inspect it . He received an order to return the way he came unless he wished to see strange sights , so away he went . Of course he stands to make ever so much more money , more quickly , from his stock in the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sample , ranchers ca n't be counted upon to have any money at all . He 'll be living on nothing a year until August eleventh . A pity . I had to look elsewhere for ready-money . " " Like Calvin , " I said . " Calvin was going to go looking for work so we could buy photographic chemicals , but I said . . . " I stopped . Ready-money was a thing I now had considerably less of myself , and it was n't a subject I cared to discuss with someone like Gilmore Carmichael . " Me look for work ? Good lord no , " Gil said . " I came looking for another acquaintance , to see if he would n't like to lend me enough money to buy into Freddie 's company . " He laughed a long time over this . I could n't see why , until he went on to tell how the joke was on him . Freddie 's partners had offered Gil an opportunity to sell A.C.M. Company stock , with a share for him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down because he thought it would be much easier to borrow from his other acquaintance , a Colonel Stevens , an Englishman who was engineer of the Texas &; Kansas Railways , which Gil said was built with English gold and owned in England . Colonel Stevens was supposed to be somewhere between Denton and Denison City , but he was n't . He was back in England . " So there I was , " Gil ended cheerfully . " Stranded . " " What are you going to do now ? " I asked . " Hammer my way to Denton and collect my eight shillings from Hamilcar B. Burr , " Gil said . " My two dollars , I mean . That should take a day or two . There does n't seem to be much point in planning beyond that . " Calvin looked at me , and even in the flicker of the fire I thought I could see the wish in his eyes to offer Gil the silver dollar we 'd made , and I said quickly , " I guess you could write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " Not for five more months , " he said . " Unless I 'm actually in Manchester and the old lady wants me out , she does n't care to hear from me more often than that . " " What about your father ? " I said . Calvin cleared his throat , and I said , " Beg pardon . " Gil only laughed . He said , " I no longer have a father . We never got along , for various reasons , and after a really fine row several years ago over my joining the Social Democratic Federa-62  | tion he , uh , ceased to consider me henceforth as a member of his family . ' He did it up right , you know . My sisters say he obliterated my name from the family Bible . And of course he cut me out of his will . A pity . I was the only son , and my father had done quite well in the sherry trade . I suppose that 's where the original trouble started . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into any business . " I leaned back in my quilt and watched the night . Cicadas were unwinding somewhere . Gil and Calvin talked on about the Social Democratic Federation , which turned out to be some offsounding group that aimed at overthrowing capitalistic society and substituting something called " ordered co-operation " in place of " anarchical competition . " I did n't know what to think about that , but I soon relaxed when Gil said he had gotten disgusted with these people 's factional strife and had quit them to work on his own for what he called democratic control of the economic resources of the community . If I had Gil pegged correctly , he did n't do much work of any kind for anything . After that I did n't listen much . I was thinking about the big , red-covered Bible at home , and wondering if , when I did n't come home , my father would take it out of the shelf where it was kept and take his pen and scratch out my name and blow on the page to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about the Fairchilds , I somehow could n't see my father scratching out the name of his only son . If the new baby my stepmother was carrying was a boy , well , maybe then . As if I gave a damn . Calvin said , " Are n't we , Pepper ? " and I said , " What ? " " Are n't we already in the prairies ? " he said . He turned back to Gil . " I reckon we 've seen the last of the piney woods . Then well be past the prairies and in the true plains . It 's like the ocean , they say . They say the wind blows a thousand miles . " Calvin 's voice was low and rapt . So was Gil 's when he spoke : " A thousand miles . " " The last new land , " Calvin said . " We always look West , " Gil said . He flopped over on his stomach and propped his chin in his hands . " Why is that ? Because we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eastward where we should look for our new life ? " " Men just always do seem to look West , " Calvin said . 63  | I thought they were both only dreaming out loud . But I listened . What Calvin had said about the wind and the sea had caught me . On the other side of a sea would be a shore . On a new shore , there could truly be a new life . I intended to look things over carefully and be practical and , hopefully , be devilishly clever about it , but that 's exactly what I had in mind for myself . " If it 's the last new land , " Gil said , " maybe it really would be worth taking a look at . By August ninth , preferably . You know , Freddie and his partners paint the most dreadful pictures of what their scheme is going to do to that mining town . Oh , they think it sounds lovely  --  a hundred smokestacks adorning the hills ... the lulling music of the constantly dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasting . " Calvin said , a little sadly , " It sounds just like New York City . " " Indeed , one would want to grab one 's money and run , " Gil said . " You know , Calvin , you 've really let us down a bit over here . I believe we all expected you to develop a whole new breed of men and a whole new society . Oh , I know that we keep exporting Freddies to help you ruin things , but what do you have in your New Yorks and Chicagos and Tombstones and thereabouts ? Captains of industry . Laissez faire . Machines . It 's England all over again . " " I do n't like to be the one to say it , but if you 'd bought the stock in the mining company , would n't you be a captain of industry yourself ? " Calvin said . Gil laughed softly . " My friend , you 've trapped me . But I thought I might give my profits away . Help the cause back in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards revolution . We must n't allow things to go on the way they are , must we ? " " Is that what you 're looking for ? " Calvin said . " Something better ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps I only think there must be something better . " Calvin said , " Well , we 've got to think that . " " Or at least hope , " Gil said . I sighed . " I 'd better go bring in the mules for the night . " The fire was low , but I could see both of them look startled . Then Gil said , " We 'll help . " He jumped lightly to his feet . He 64  | gave Calvin a hand to help him up , then said to both of us , " I wonder , would it put us too far out of our way to detour through Denton ? I 'm told the road is excellent . Better than the cutoff from Sherman . " Why no , " Calvin said immediately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no end of ranches between here and Denton . " " Excellent , " Gil said . " I imagine I 've put up at least twentyfive or so posters today , and there 's no point in wasting all that work . We can collect the two dollars as we go through . " Calvin said , " You can stay here and rest , Pepper . We 'll get up the mules . " And I did stay there , dumbfounded . They 'd never said a direct word about it . I 'd listened enough for that . But it was as clear to me as spring water under noon sun what was going to happen : Calvin was n't going to say a word to stop him , and that wandering tramp who wanted to be a captain of industry just so he could become some crazy sort of social revolutionary , who treated a pair of strangers ' salt beef and pullets as his very own , who found no point in planning his life more than a couple of days in advance , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself than dreamy-brained Calvin , whose total assets apparently amounted to the two dollars he 'd get for putting up posters  --  minus two cents for one too far from the road  --  Gilmore Carmichael was obviously now planning to go all the way to the West . With us. 65  | I tried to head Gil off . I even invested in it . Naturally , I invested my own money , because Calvin would n't have thought it was right to try to get rid of even an uninvited guest , and so the way I figured it , it would n't have been right to invest what little money Calvin had made in trying to do just that . It was complicated . I figured it all out carefully . First the opportunity had to arise , and it did when we hit one of the world 's biggest chuckholes coming into Sherman and messed up a wheel . We had to stop over , getting it fixed , and Gil began to worry that he would n't get his posters nailed up all the way to Denton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday . That was the opportunity . Here 's what I did : I got out my sack and got out a greenback and gave it to Gil and sent him on ahead . I made it convincing . I pointed out to him and Calvin that the way things were going , we were making grub but too little money , and that the thing to do was advertise . We worked out a nice notice that told people Calvin Fairchild would be coming through , and they should get their portraits made . Well , Calvin was so pleased that even if I 'd considered confiding in him that the whole thing was just a scheme to get rid of a new burden of responsibility named Gilmore Carmichael , I would have changed my mind on the spot . Calvin said maybe our notice should say Mr. S. J. Boldini was coming through ,  | to avoid confusing people about the wagon , but I could tell easily that he was tickled at the idea of seeing his own name printed in a newspaper . I went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , who was nice , and who told me that Denton had a photographer , as far as he knew , but he thought there was none in a thriving nearby community , Krum , with a thriving weekly newspaper , the Krum Chronicle . With that information in hand , I told Gil he should go to Krum and place our notice there . Naturally , I never expected to see him again . Not once he had Mr. Hamilcar B. Burr 's two dollars and my greenback in his pocket . Calvin would be disappointed when our notice with his name was n't in the Chronicle , but I promised myself I 'd stake him to another advertisement sometime , and make it up to him . Something that worried us happened in Sherman after Gil left . The wheelwright agreed to fix our wheel in exchange for portraits of his three little girls , and while Calvin and I were off at the wheelwright 's house , someone must have come along and spotted our wagon sitting on the street and decided to play some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop the plate , we found a scrawled note tacked onto the dark-box door . It said : I thought right away about Otis Wasum and his big brother ,  | Shirley . Not that I had any thought that Shirley might have written the note . Shirley might be a reckless hell-raiser , but he was straight and direct like his old daddy , and no churchgoer to boot . But Otis , when he was n't busy starting fistfights and sneaking around in mercantile stores to lay for innocent people , was kind of Sunday-school prone and went to all the tent revival meetings with his momma . That note sounded like something he might have constructed slyly to put the fear into us , and it did succeed in making me pretty nervous . I wanted to start carrying my shotgun , a Greener 10-gauge that my Uncle Raleigh had given me for a fowling piece , but Calvin said no , it was just a coincidence that some passer-by had elected to put a Bible notice on our wagon . He said in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed us or found us in such big country , and in the second place why would n't they have made a try for us if they had indeed found us , and in the third place that I was just being jumpy because of Uncle Raleigh 's mysterious telegram . Personally , I figured I was n't being it jumpy , just careful . I could n't fathom the whole thing , but at least I knew it would n't have been so hard for Otis and Shirley or anyone else to find us , since the folks back in Claiborne Parish knew we would have to head south from Denison City to reach the Butterfield . I put the shotgun near to hand in the wagon just in case I was right , but Calvin preferred to think it was just some wandering evangelist who had put the note there . Before all that happened I had entertained the idea that we could maybe linger in Sherman awhile and make some money , for people were interested as could be in the What's-It Wagon . But Calvin , dreamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Krum by Saturday , to meet Gil and to make photographs , as our advertisement supposedly said , and what with that note on the wagon and my worrying about Otis and Shirley and all , I decided not to argue . I knew well that we did n't even have to go through Denton County , since Gil would long be gone with my greenback , but I could n't very well explain that to Calvin . So when we finally left Sherman we worked our way along the route to Denton , still keeping our eyes peeled as instructed by Uncle Raleigh and also looking for the turnoff to Krum . We were late getting into Krum . This was cotton and wheat 69  | country , and folks had a little money in their pockets here and there , despite the high railway freight charges that they complained about a lot . We camped by a nice pond Friday night , although , shades of home , I saw two water moccasins and we both got edgy and slept in the wagon bed . We started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roadway and said he guessed his wife had a craving to have her portrait made . He insisted we come along to his house , or I swear Calvin would have hurried us on into Krum by the time the sun got strong . As it was , it was probably ten o'clock when we could begin seeing the town off ahead of us . Meadowlarks were whistling . I 'd spotted more than one covey of bobwhites . I 've known men to shoot meadowlarks for quail , not noting the yellow in the wings or even the difference in how they fly , and I was telling this to Calvin , who did n't hunt , and watching hedgerows . Your bobwhite might be found in an open field , but you would n't find many meadowlarks hanging around hedgerows . Then : " Good God almighty ! " I said . " Do n't cuss , " Calvin said . " But good God ! It 's him ! " I pointed , for it was  --  Gilmore Carmichael , dozing in the shade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Calvin said , and his damaged lip split wide in a big smile that he forgot to point downward . " Stop the mules , Pepper . " Gil sat up , sleepy-looking , and Calvin was out of the wagon and helping him before he had time to get to his feet . " I was beginning to think you were n't coming , " Gil said . " We ran into business along the way this morning , " Calvin said . " The man just would n't be turned down . " They commenced patting and pounding each other , happy as two pups . Gil said , " I have something you 'll be interested to see . " He dug into his pocket and reached out a newspaper . Calvin beamed and laughed over it , sounding shy . Up Gil sprang to the wagon . He rumpled my hair , which , being red , seemed to attract people that way . " It should be a good day , " he said to me . " A shop is raffling off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the town to fill up for the occa-  | lion . That 's what the editor of the paper told me . She 's a woman . Quite a young one . " He laughed . " Have you ever heard of a woman running a newspaper ? I want you to get a look at her . She 's as peppery as you . " Oh , red hair ? " I said . I think that 's what I said . I was still just so bowled over with surprise . " No , just peppery inside . Calvin , give Pepper the newspaper . Here . That 's quite an advertisement , is n't it ? " He looked as proud as if he 'd written it . Of course , he did help . The exclamation marks and changing " artist " to " artiste " were his idea . I must say it looked splendid . It said : Mr. Calvin Fairchild ! Photographic Artiste from New York City and Homer , Louisiana ! ! Will arrive in town Saturday For a few days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got Gil 's pack loaded into the wagon and he settled himself on the bench , his head poked so far forward that it was just about on a line with ours , rattling away . He 'd gone into Denton and collected his two dollars from Hamilcar B. Burr . The agent had miscounted and they only wanted to pay him a dollar and seventy-eight cents , but he 'd insisted , and he had his way . No , he had n't parted with the hammer . The two dollars in hand , he 'd sworn he 'd lost it . He had backed them down . Being somewhat smaller than most men , he 'd early had to learn to stand up for himself , you see ? He gave them back the leftover nails . Hamilcar B. Burr had made the agent count them . There was laughter all through this , warm as sunshine , and despite myself I could n't help but be sort of glad to see him . I tried to sort this feeling out , but it was n't easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into town . Krum was just a crossroads  | hamlet but drew business from a large market area . He 'd gotten our copy of the paper when it started off the press the night before , near nine o'clock , and spent the night in Krum with some fellow who 'd been working in the slaughterhouse to get up a road-stake for going to Arizona Territory to go into mining , which gave him and Gil a common interest . Traded the hammer at the town 's one hotel for a late supper for both of them . Had we ever before heard of a woman running a newspaper ? Her brother-in-law was owner , but the woman took the advertisements and largely wrote it . And was she peppery ? Listen to these editorials : Red Territory should be settled solely by the Indians , and the white trash hanging around North Texas hoping to grab somebody else 's land should go back where they came from . And : If the slack and mush-headed cotton farmers of Denton County just sit on their hands and let Thos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the services of hired bullies , they would have only their own well-documented stupidity to blame if cotton-ginning charges rose to sky-high levels at picking season . We went first to the newspaper office . That was Gil 's idea . He 'd seen how Calvin kept reading that notice of ours , and decided Calvin should have an additional copy . After that , he 'd take us to the perfect spot he 'd picked out to park the wagon and set up shop . For a Saturday and a day when a parlor set was to be raffled off , that was the quietest town you could ever hope to see . There were some women and little children on the street , but few men . In front of the newspaper office , a little old man was sitting on the boardwalk drinking from a pint bottle of White Rye Whiskey . We stopped . " Who 're you looking for ? " the old man promptly shouted out . " Uh , a copy of today 's newspaper , " said I. " Ai n't none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point arguing with a man who would sit about drinking whiskey and shouting on the public street . I handed Calvin the lines and climbed down to go inside . " Ai n't nobody there , " the little old man shouted . I was patient . I said , " Well , when will somebody be back ? "  | " Ai n't coming back , " he shouted . " Leastwise she ai n't . You 'll have to look for her down by the cemetery . " ' This aroused Gil . " That young woman ? " he said . " She died ? " The little old man cackled . He laughed so hard that he began to roll about on the boardwalk . Like most , it had been put up in sections by the individual merchants , and each had his own idea about the proper height , so there were steps up and steps down all along the line . The old man rolled off the nearest step and landed face down . He lay there sort of giggling to himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Gil . " I ca n't imagine , " he said . " Could she have died ? Had we better find out ? " " We sure should , " I said . After all , the way it had turned out , my greenback had been invested in that newspaper . I stepped to the door and looked inside . The newspaper office was all topsy-turvy , with things strewn about everywhere . " Perhaps we should drive by the cemetery , " Gil said . It was all the way out of town , down a hill by a creek . We could see wagons and horses and folks milling around as we came down the hill . A man rode by us on a horse , going fast toward the cemetery , and Gil shouted to him : " Mr. Desmond ? Wait a minute , Mr. Desmond . What 's hap-pening ? " The man reined up a second . He may have been about the same age as my father , which was forty-five , but it was hard to tell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his face , sun-darkened just about to the color of his old , well-cared-for California saddle , was deep-lined and , at least at that moment , grim . His eyes flicked quickly over us and our wagon . He said to Gil , " Have you arms ? I had to go back after my rifle . Hurry up , if you want to help . " " But , man , you 've been ill , " Gil said . He sounded bewildered , and it must have been a silly thing to say , for the man only grimaced and gave boot-heel to his horse . He was down the hill in a wink . Gil said to us , " He 's been ill . He should n't be rushing about that way . " " Is he a friend of yours ? " I asked . " I suppose so . That 's the man I had supper with last night . "  | Calvin said , " Then we 'd better hurry , Pepper . " We did . Gil 's friend , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules , but there was shouting and angry voices from some big trees by the creek . I glanced at Calvin , and he nodded , and I took my shotgun out from under a piece of tow sacking where I had been keeping it handy since the note in Sherman . Calvin had n't brought along an arm . He always said he was too poor a shot . Gil pulled a tiny pistol out of his pack and stuck it in his pocket . We were all three excited and worried by then , and we ran across a cornfield toward the voices . The cemetery lay off to the side . I noticed even as I ran that people in these parts were pretty careless about letting weeds grow on their kin . The voices belonged to a big bunch of men . In the middle of them was Gil 's friend , Mr. Desmond . He was saying savagely , " Back off , now . I 'm warning you . " We pushed through them . They moved aside for us easily enough , maybe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carrying much more than an occasional sidearm . In the middle of the circle with Mr. Desmond was a woman covered from skirt-hem to head-top with feathers . She was crying . Near her stood a man dabbed with oozy brown stuff and a feather or two here and there . A little old man , about the age of the one who fancied White Rye Whiskey back at the newspaper office , said to me , " Who are you , boy ? You just put that shotgun down and get out of here . This here is no concern of yours . " " I guess it is , " I said loudly . " I guess where I come from we do n't just stand around and let a bunch of sonsofbitches tar and feather a woman . " " Hell , boy , that 's not tar , " the man said . " That 's just molasses . " But I moved into the center of the circle with Mr. Desmond . Calvin was right beside me , firm at my shoulder . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , turning , I spotted him . He had chosen what must have been the biggest man there , a tall , broad fellow , bald but young , and stationed himself in front of him , glaring at him as if at any minute he just might decide to eat the fellow alive .  | Someone else in the crowd said , What the hell , we 're done anyway . " But still another man , with a big , black beard , said , " He 's going to chew up that newspaper and swallow it . I 'm not done until I see him swallow it . " The man with the dab of feathers said in a gloomy voice , " I 'll be glad to . I 've told you before and I 'll tell you again , it 's my newspaper and my responsibility . " There was an admiring murmur from the crowd . They liked that . But the woman sure as heck did n't . She could n't stop sobbing , but she got out at the feathered man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash . " " Let it be , " Mr. Desmond said to her . " Never mind . Let it be . " " And let that be a lesson to you , " the black-bearded man said to the feathered man . " You let her turn that newspaper into a piece of outhouse bung fodder . She ? " Mr. Desmond lowered his rifle on him . There was a sudden silence . It hung in the air so long that I could start hearing birdsound and water-sound down by the creek . Then in the back of the crowd some of the men started to move away . Voices came again , men murmuring : " . . . through ... " " ... taught her a lesson . . . " " . . . says S. J. Boldini ' on that wagon ... " ... fear we tromped down a lot of Ordway 's corn . . . " The man Gil had been glaring at was among those who left , and Gil came farther into the dissolving circle with us . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then turned back . He said stoutly to Calvin and me , " You meddling whelps . You 're not welcome in Krum , Texas . You stay out of our town . " " I expect it 's not a town we 'd care to be seen in , " Calvin said , but the old man did n't understand him . Well , they left . Ordway 's young corn , if that 's who it belonged to , underwent considerably more trampling . The feathered man said gloomily to us , " It was calling them mush-headed . I warned Emma it was going too far . She 'd already gadflied everybody in the county . " The woman doubled up a dainty fist covered with feathers and sprang at him . She hit him square on the forehead . Down he went on his back , and she stood over him and cried , " Mush ! 75  | Slab-sided mush ! You 're the mushiest of all ! You did n't even stand up to them ! You let them spit on you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done fine with the crowd , and maybe we 'd helped , but it was Gil who was able to contend now . He touched her elbow . She jerked it away , but he took it again and turned her toward the creek . " I 'm sorry we got here so late , Miss Prosser , " he said . " Those contemptible cowards . I 'm afraid there 's molasses in your hair . There 's water right here . " She was still sobbing , but trying not to . I guessed if they 'd just used molasses she was probably crying as much from humiliation and fury as she was from hurt , although I noticed later the feathers had been well mixed with cockleburs . Gil got her started for the creek , with her still sobbing out , " Thieves , " and " Blackguards , " and things like that , but maybe also beginning to think about what she must look like with molasses in her hair . Mr. Desmond took on the feathered man . But not to help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never heard used just that way before , the gist of his message being the kind of creature the man was for standing by and letting a bunch of mangy dogs molasses-and-feather his sister-in-law . " What could I do ? " the feathered man said . " I told them the responsibility was mine . I told them to molasses-and-feather me instead . What else could I do ? " " I guess you 're going to go slinking back there , " Mr. Desmond said . " My . . . my wife is there . My family . My newspaper . " " Get going , " Mr. Desmond said . " I . . . I think Emma should come back to town with me , " the feathered man said . " Stop thinking . Get going , " Mr. Desmond said . " But . . . Emma ... " Mr. Desmond took a step toward the feathered man . Off he went . Across the cornfield , a few men were still standing about . We could see them talking for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathered man climbed into a wagon . They all left . Mr. Desmond turned his back on them and moved off to the creek . We followed . Gil had persuaded the woman to sit down on the creek bank  | and was bringing her water in his hat . She 'd gotten some of the feathers off her hands . She 'd just about stopped crying . Mr. Desmond said to her , " Are you all right ? " She said , " I 'd like to kill them all . " " Urn , " Mr. Desmond said . " Gil , I do n't think the lady knows your friends , and maybe they 've earned an introduction . " Well , Gil named Calvin and me , and he renamed himself and Mr. Desmond , who said his first name was Hap , because their acquaintance with Miss Emma Prosser was apparently slight . She tried to collect herself and say the necessary how-d'you-do 's . She thanked us for helping her , and so did Mr. Desmond . During all this thanking , Gil fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and began to try to help get off the feathers . Mr. Desmond said , " The creek would be best for that . I And this boy here would be the best to help you , Miss Prosser . " I ' He eyed Calvin 's split lip , distracted enough after all the excitement to do it openly , and said , " Him , too . " But Gil jumped into the creek , boots and everything on , and insisted on helping Calvin and me help her . When the feathers started coming off , I could see why . Miss Emma Prosser was a ripe woman . Ripe like a bursting fig in sunlight , with a ripe , moist mouth you 'd think wasps would be quick to buzz around . She was somewhat disarrayed , with her hair out of its pins and her dress askew , and after a while so much skin was showing that she thanked Gil and Calvin and sent them back to Mr. Desmond on the bank and just kept me to help her . When I finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath was coming a bit hard . Mr. Desmond had leaned himself and his rifle against a giant pecan tree . He politely looked away , chewing a twig , until Emma spoke and thanked him all over again . When she was n't mad and calling people names , she seemed to have nice manners . " Tell me how I can best help you , Miss Prosser , " Mr. Desmond said . " Do you want me to get a buggy ? Do you want to go back into town ? " " I 'll never set foot in that town again ! " she cried . " If you 're worried about ? " " I 'm not worried about those vile scavengers . I 'd be worried 77  | for them . I could n't trust myself if I ever saw a one of them again . She was spirited all right . She began to stride back and forth and act it all out for us . They had come about an hour earlier that morning , once the newspaper had had time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and jawed about " editorials contrary to the community 's interest . " As if straight-spoken editorials did n't make people sit up and take notice . She 'd learned that from her poppa , who had run newspapers all over Kentucky and Ohio . It was he who had staked her brother-in-law , time and time over , for starting dinky little newspapers , and staked him again , each time the last one failed , for the sake of her three-year-younger sister . This last newspaper , the Krum Chronicle , was failing again when her poppa , who had long been ailing , finally died , and she had come West to take over where her poppa 's money had left off . The Chronicle was back on its feet in her first month and started showing a profit in her second . Naturally , she 'd written plenty of editorials , to make people take notice of the Chronicle , and there was n't a word in them that was n't true , and what did we think of a bunch of blackguards who 'd handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably jawed them into molasses-andfeathering her when they maybe just came to grumble . But I did n't say it . Instead , I said that , where we came from , we 'd call them dirty curs for picking on a woman . She said , " Good grief ! It 's not because I 'm a woman . It 's because they 're a pack of . . . vile . . . the miserable little .. . mush-headed . . . " She 'd started crying again . It seemed to me it was my fault . I tried to make remedy . With Gil 's help I coaxed her across the cornfield and to our wagon , and got her settled in the shade of the canopy on the spring seat . Gil dug into his pack and fetched out a flask quarter-full of brandy , which she waved away and then consented to sip about enough to make a hummingbird do headstands . After a while she settled down again . She said : " Who 's S. J. Boldini ? " " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wagon . Calvin is a photographic artiste , and we 're hard on the road west to San Diego , California . "  | " Oh , " Emma said , wanly . She did n't speak again for a while , and Mr. Desmond , who stayed on the ground but was leaning against the wagon , looked her over much as if she were a heifer for sale and he was toting up her good and bad points against her price . Pretty soon he said , apparently idly , to Calvin and me , " Gil tells me you 're routing through the New Mexico and Arizona territories . Is that right ? " " Yessir , " I said . " I 'm headed to Arizona Territory myself , " he said . " Big Bug . " " Is that a town ? " I said . " No , Big Bug 's a creek , " he said . " They found a lot of placer there in ' 63 , and while there ai n't much placer left , they 're doing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rough little rocks out of his pocket and exhibited them . " Is that silver , sir ? " I said . " Of course not . Gold . A good friend of mine sent me these samples . His own claim got took by eastern capital , but I figure there 's plenty of possibility left . I plan on gold for a while to get up a stake for ranching . " I said , " Gil 's got a friend thinking on water in Tombstone . " Gil cast an uncomfortable glance at Miss Emma Prosser and said defensively , " Well , it 's not just water . There 's silver too . And the A.C.M. Company consulting engineers believe there 's a huge body of copper underneath the silver . " " My , " Mr. Desmond said mildly , " that batch of engineers seem to think they 've got everything in the world in just that one mine . Gil said , " But you said yourself some other mine in Tombstone has struck water . That shows there 's definitely water there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contention both , from what I hear . Maybe that means you 're going to have some competition in the water-mining business . " Now Gil started looking more self-assured  --  in fact , downright smug  --  and he said , " But , my good fellow , do they know how to handle it ? It will do them no good unless they can get it to the surface . The A.C.M. Company engineers have the trick all worked out  --  duplex , triple-expansion , condensing-type pumps with steam cylinders , ordered from England , of course . "  | I said , " What in the world kind of machinery is that ? " Gil smiled suddenly . " I have n't the least idea , " he confessed . " But it sounds impressive , does n't it ? " Our damp and dampened refugee was apparently coming back to life . She said , " What is that famous mining company planning to burn to make steam for its pumps ? Cactus ? " " Oh no , " Gil said . " Trees , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Desmond said . " Coal ? " Gil offered , somewhat less certainly . " Maybe there 's coal , " Mr. Desmond said . " I never paid much attention to such as that . What 's below ground is not my usual line . " I said , " It sounds like you know the country above ground . " " I do , " he said . " I know it well . " " Have you spent time there ? " " There and elsewhere . " We 'd thought to follow the Butterfield going through , " I said . " That 's what Gil told me . " Gil 's face took on an excited look . " Desmond knows the country , whereas we have the wagon and what-not . What do you think , Miss Prosser ? There 's nothing to stay here for . I think you should go with us . And Mr. Desmond , of course . " " Dear me , I could n't put you out like that , " she said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd both be mighty welcome , " Calvin said . " Oh really , you must come , " Gil said . I said nothing at all . He had done it again  --  - struck me dumb with surprise . Here he 'd offered a wagon and mules and means that he had no share whatever in , that I could see , to a pair of perfect strangers , and invited them as nice as if we were in a parlor sipping tea to go west with us . And they did .  | But first , Miss Emma Prosser did set foot in Krum , Texas , again . Nothing would serve but that she go straight down the main street of a town that had run her out and stare every passer-by straight in the eye . It took some time . To begin with , she had to let her long brown hair dry and bun it up as best she could , she having lost most of her hairpins and we carrying nothing of that sort in our supplies . Next she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and looked around and refused to answer her brother-in-law . She left without taking anything . I had decided by that time she was just waiting to see if anybody wanted to fight . Lastly , she had us drive her to her sister 's house , which was out past a big feed mill on the edge of town . The sister rushed outside , eyes all red and scared , followed by three little children whose eyes looked much the same . She grabbed Emma and rushed her into the house . We could hear the sound of lots of crying and carrying on . The crying sounded sad , not angry , so I judged it was the sister doing it . We waited . I got plenty hungry . Mr. Desmond waited on his horse at first , watching the road , then he finally got off and the horse started cropping the tall Johnson grass that grew along the roadside . Finally Mr. Desmond said to me , " Do you know how to use that shotgun ? " " Yessir , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Calvin said . Mr. Desmond did n't catch it , but Gil did , and saved me the problem of having to repeat a compliment on myself . " It 's taking Miss Prosser a time to pack , " Mr. Desmond said . " I 'll go by and get my own traps . If anyone tries to come down that road , I want you to see that they do n't come very far . " " What about you , sir ? " I said . " From the way folks looked at us as we drove through , maybe you should n't go into town by yourself . " A very small smile , as though something tickled him but he was trying not to show it , flickered at the corners of his mouth . " I expect I wo n't have any trouble , " he said . " I can go with you , " Gil offered . " No need . You wait here and carry out Miss Prosser 's things . " " What if she changes her mind ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Desmond 's face went grim . " Are you trying to say she 's not welcome to ride along with you ? " he said . " Oh no , sir , " I said . " I can look out for Miss Prosser , " Mr. Desmond said . He looked very firmly at Gil as he said this . " She wo n't be any trouble to you . " A little less firmly , he added , " I can also be of considerable help to you along the way . I 'm telling you this , it 's rough country where you 're going , and I 've got good friends all along the route who 'll be happy to repay past favors . " " Well , that 's mighty fine , " I said . " We wo n't be a burden on you , " Mr. Desmond said , looking firm again . " I was sick for a time , but I 'm fine now . It was nothing catching , either , unless working too hard in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm fine now . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Mr. Desmond , " I said . " You can call me Hap , " he said . But I never could . He was always Mr. Desmond to me . He got on his horse , a nice-looking roan gelding with two white stockings , and left . Gil watched him . He said , " He does n't look so fine to me . He looks ill . " " Maybe it 's just age , " I said . " No , he looks ill . What if he becomes ill again along the way ? "  | " Well it was you that invited him , " I said . I had n't meant to say it . The words just came out . Gil looked surprised . " Was n't it all right ? " Calvin started in to say soothing things , like of course it was all right , and naturally we were happy to assist Miss Prosser in any way , and Mr. Desmond seemed a fine man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road . One man on foot . I put the shotgun across my lap and was starting to feel a little edgy until I saw it was only Emma 's brother-in-law from the newspaper . He stepped to the other side of the road and circled around us and headed for the front door . " Do we allow him to enter ? " Gil said . " I guess so , " I said . " It 's his house . " He was no sooner in than Emma came out . She 'd changed her stained dress to an all-over brown thing with a white collar and a white hat . It would have done for church . The sister and brother-in-law followed her . He was saying , " . . . must take some money . She ignored him . " Good-bye , Alice , " she said to the sister . " And remember , if you 're ever in difficulties , get in touch with me immediately . " " You 're going to be the one who 's in difficulties , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much money , but you must take ? " She stopped him with a steely look . The sister apparently had never let up crying . She said wealdy , " Emma , you must take the money . I know we ca n't pay it all back yet , but you ca n't just go off without a penny to your name . " Tut , " said Emma . I had the strong impression she was addressing her words to someone other than her sister . " I fear your household will need it worse than I. Besides , I 'm far from penniless . Shall I leave you something extra ? For when things begin to go . . . bad again ? " " Oh Emma , " the sister wept . " Things are going to go just fine here , " the brother-in-law said , but he still sounded gloomy . Emma said , " I fear some people may find out it 's not so easy when they finally have to fish or cut bait all on their own . But 83  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled you can always count on me . The sister wept , " But Emma , what will you do ? Where will you go ? " " Tut , " said Emma . " Does n't the San Francisco Chronicle have a lady reporter ? Is n't Catharine Amanda Scott Coburn an editor on the Portland Evening Telegram ? The real West is progressive , and there are ladies running newspapers all over it . I 'll simply look around and make my choice . I do n't need all the money our poor poppa threw down a rathole . I 'll do very well on my own . " The brother-in-law looked gloomier than ever . The little children crowded to the door and began helping their mother cry . Emma told us that we could bring her trunks out now , please . There was one middle-sized trunk and a scad of little boxes and bundles and things . " Where do we put them ? " I said to Calvin . " In back of the bench , I guess , " he said . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were still stowing stuff when Mr. Desmond came riding back . A big black dog with a skinny tail was trotting behind his horse 's heels . Mr. Desmond was carrying not much new except a blanket roll and a couple of saddlebags on the back of his saddle , and a big paper parcel of something that smelled mighty meaty and good . He tipped his hat to Emma and her weeping sister and leaned over to set the parcel in the wagon . The dog flopped down under the wagon right below the parcel . The brother-in-law watched all these various affairs with big sad eyes , which went from Calvin to me to Gil to Mr. Desmond . Finally he picked Calvin . He said to him , " I 'm not saying she did n't try to help all she could . I 'm not saying their daddy did n't help . What I 'm saying is , it 's hard to go on being grateful all your life . " Calvin got very red in the face . His mouth began to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was all . I had nothing else to say to a man who had so few objections to letting a woman get roughed up . And I sure did n't want Calvin to have to discuss with him the question of gratitude to kinfolk . To avoid exchanging more words with the brother-in-law , I asked Mr. Desmond  | if that dog belonged to him , and he looked firm and said , " Yes . He wo n't be any trouble . " " What 's his name ? " I said . " Nemo . " " I never heard a dog called that . What kind of name is that ? " I said . " I do n't know , " Mr. Desmond said . " I did n't name him . " " He looks like an old dog , " I said , trying to be nice and show no one minded having a dog along . " Shall I lift him up in the wagon , or can he jump ? " " He 's not old , " Mr. Desmond said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere I wanted him to , but he 's not to ride in the wagon . He can walk . " Well , Calvin and Gil got on the bench , and Mr. Desmond stayed on his horse , and the dog followed the horse , and Emma sat next to me on the spring seat . Her eyes were looking red after all the good-bye-saying to her sister and the children , but when I asked her if we could just follow this road on out , she said , " Drive through town . " We did . She sat like a queen on the seat of that faded blue What's-It Wagon . The town was n't very crowded , but there were people enough for her to look in the eye . I guessed they had postponed the raffling off of the parlor set , or there might have been even more . We passed slowly down the main street , and she said , " The best road 's the one that goes by the cemetery . I guess you know where that is . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last house , a white frame one with honeysuckle growing heavy on the front fence , before she sighed and her eyes got red again and three or four big tears rolled down each cheek , but she checked it and did n't really cry . It was a long time after that before I saw her really cry . So there we were , heading a little southwest out of that little Texas town , with my responsibilities consisting of one ailing old-timer and one somewhat unladylike lady and one horse and one dog more than when we 'd rolled in . But the thing foremost on my mind was the paper parcel full of food smells that Mr. Desmond had put in the wagon , and I guess he saw my nose 85  | sniffing in that direction . He said , " It 's spareribs . A man barbecues them every Saturday , and I bought all he had left . But I did n't run across any bread . " " I can make bread , " Emma said . For some reason she sounded indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said hopefully . " I thought we might stop somewhere when we get clean out of this place , " Mr. Desmond said . We were probably two or three miles farther along when Gil said , " There are some big trees ahead . Perhaps we should stop and eat something . " So in we pulled . There were two ruts going off and a gate , which Gil sprang down and opened , then fastened behind us . We cut off from the ruts and went into the trees . It was just grass , with no crops , so we did no harm aside from disturbing a half-dozen Herefords , which got up when they saw Mr. Desmond 's dog and moseyed off from the shade they had been resting under . It was obvious other folks had stopped there before , because there was a rusted Crosse &; Blackwell tomato can and a jam can and other bits of junk , to which Mr. Desmond gave a disgusted look . There was even one of Gil 's posters nailed to a tree , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have had others out nailing up his reward notices , for he had n't put it there . I needed to find a bush , so I took the bucket and said I 'd look around and see if there was water . Everyone hurried off in different directions , including Emma . Traveling with a woman was going to pose certain problems . Up a gully the ground was soggy , so after I did my business I followed it farther and sure enough found a spring . A rusty red fox was drinking from it , and when he saw me he sat still and I stood still . We watched each other for the space of several heartbeats . Then he was off , so quickly that he was stretched out and running hard before I was even sure he 'd moved . I filled the bucket and went back to the wagon . Calvin had spread a quilt for Emma to sit upon . Gil was building a little fire . Mr. Desmond had unsaddled his horse . It looked as if they were settling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we easily could have made Denton .  | " There 's water ? " Gil said . " How far ? I would n't mind a wash . . Oh , sorry Miss Prosser . You first , of course . " " No thank you , " she said tartly . It was the way she said it that reminded all of us that she 'd already had just about an all-over bath that day getting the molasses off . Gil made it worse a minute later when I asked if we were n't to go any farther that day , and he replied , " Oh , surely there 's no hurry . And Miss Prosser has had a fatiguing day . " " If you think I 'm ashamed of what happened , you 've got another think coming , " Emma snapped at him . " No indeed , " Gil said . " I 'm sure you were completely in the right . If anyone need be ashamed , it 's the town of Krum , Texas . " She looked at him suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking his true opinion or just teasing her , and to tell the truth I was n't sure myself . Mr. Desmond said , " I 'll tell you this , it 's a long , hard road ahead , and it 's not going to make much difference whether we get a few more miles under our belts today . I say we stop here and make our plans and start out fresh in the morning . Not that I 'm tired . I feel fine . " I did n't really like his taking charge that way . After all , whose wagon did he think everyone but him and his dog were riding in ? I said , " This here is obviously a ranch . You folks might stay here , after we eat of course , and Calvin and I will go take some portraits while the light 's still good . We 've got our travel money to make . " Oh , not today , Pepper , " Calvin said . That was his way , to forget his own interests and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems best , to make our plans . I know you 're keen on good plans . " That was true . I said so , and agreed we should just stay . Emma said if we had a Dutch oven and the makings , she would put on some biscuits to go with Mr. Desmond 's spareribs . I unhitched the mules and took them and Mr. Desmond 's horse to water . Gil came too , stopping first to get soap and things from his pack , and Mr. Desmond sent his dog along . The animals drank first , then Gil stripped down and jumped into the spring pond and began to wash . He did n't mind being seen naked any more than the fox had minded being seen in its 87  | rusty red coat . He told me I should come in too , but I declined . " You make a better Englishman than I , Pepper , " Gil said . " You 're reticent , and you keep your mind on business , and you do n't like to bathe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got washed off pretty good this morning , helping Miss Prosser . " " I confess I 'd rather bathe her than myself , " Gil said . My face steamed up , and he laughed and commenced trying to coax Mr. Desmond 's old dog into the pond with him . Nemo whined anxiously , obviously wanting to please but hating water , as some dogs will . He came to me to get his ears scratched . I calmed him until Gil came leaping out and dried himself with his shirt . But he was n't through yet . He soaped his face all over again and began to shave . " I know why you 're doing that , " I said after a while . " Do you now ? " " You 're doing it so she 'll look at you . But what if she likes beards ? A lot of women do  --  beards and mustaches too . " " Why Pepper , " he said , " I would n't have dreamed you knew so much about women . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , I refused to talk to him any more , for all his cajoling and trying to make friends again . We went back . We staked out the animals . We ate . The biscuits were bitter and a little green from too much saleratus that Emma had put in , but I was so hungry I did n't mind . It was Mr. Desmond who acted picky . " I see you do n't care for cooking , Emma , " he said . By that time we were all calling her Emma . " Ever do much of it ? " Her face turned red . " I certainly have , " she said . " I did all the cooking for my poppa after our mother died , and he never found anything to complain about . " " Maybe you 're just out of practice , " Mr. Desmond said . " I take it your sister did most of the cooking while you were in Krum ? " " In fact , my brother-in-law did it , while she was busy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma said . " Well , if that 's the kind of a man he was , " Mr. Desmond said .  | " Some men can cook , and some women can run newspapers , " she said . " Now , what do you have to say about that ? " In jumped Calvin , saying the biscuits were good , which they were n't , and Emma snapped at him just as if he 'd been the one doing the complaining . " I did make the biscuits , did n't I ? " she said . " I knew you were all expecting me to . Well , I 'm determined to do my share . I 'll make biscuits all the way to San Francisco if that 's what you want , but I 'd think you 'd be gentlemen enough not to complain about the way I make them . " ' We 're only going to San Diego , not San Francisco , " I said , hoping to draw off her snappishness . " As if I cared , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " There 's no sense in going any farther than that . " " You must be crazy , " she said . ' Why , Arizona Territory is where all those Apache Indians are . Indians and deserts and a rattlesnake under every bush . Why , you would n't catch me dead in Arizona Territory ! " Calvin tried again . " I imagine there are no end of newspapers in Arizona Territory , " he said . " You might find just the niche you 're looking for . " Mr. Desmond said , " No , it 's gold . That 's what 's worth aiming for , enough gold to get up that stake for cattle . There 's plenty of good cattle country in the territory , and cattle 's about the only thing that 's any good any more . It 's too bad that the buffalo are just about gone , or I 'll tell you this  --  we 'd eat royally all the way west , and live royally once we got there . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See them ? " He smiled his little smile , looking kind of puffed up , and I urged him to tell until he told : " I once shot two hundred and four of them from one stand in one day . That was in ' 74 . We were two killers , with a cook and a reloader and a hide pegger and two wagon men and nine skinners . One thing 's sure , we kept those skinners busy . " " Where was that ? " I said . " Where were you then ? " " Horse Canyon , " he said , " by a big rain-water lake . We were all through that country . Wait a minute , it may have been 89  | ' 76 . Granada , Colorado , that was track 's end for the Santa Fe then , and we sold our hides there . " Gil said , " Did you have to fight Indians ? " " I 've done that , " Mr. Desmond said . " The last time , I guess that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , camped in a dry camp . We got all four . " " While they were camped ? " Gil said , sounding peculiar . Mr. Desmond shrugged . " They would have been after us the next day . " But he must have noticed the way Gil sounded , for he would n't say anything more about those times . Instead , he asked Calvin and me about our plans . Calvin told how we were going to work our way , and he got so interested in what he was saying that he even told about hoping to sell photographs to Harper 's New Monthly Magazine or Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Weekly in New York and began glancing about as if hoping some marvelous view to be photographed would pop up before our very eyes . Mr. Desmond gave the What's-It Wagon something of the same kind of look he had given the clutter of rusty cans . He said , " It 'd be slow , stopping at every farm and ranch along the way . " " We do n't stop at every one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they could pay . " " I 'm thinking of Emma , " he said . " A slow trip like that , and a long one . It would wear out a woman . " She said , " Do n't worry about me . I can stand it as well as anyone else . " " It comes down to money , " Mr. Desmond said , ignoring her . " Nowadays it looks like everything comes down to money . " I stiffened . I did n't know what working in a slaughterhouse in Krum paid , but I could n't see how it would be enough for some old fellow we 'd just met that day to be looking down on us . Gil may have felt the same way , for he said , " Desmond has money on his mind at the moment . He lost a packet on something called Red River City . Is n't that what you told me , Des-mond ? " " No need to talk about that , " Mr. Desmond said . " Oh , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle near the Indian Territory . It 's the future Chicago of the Southwest . The future London . Tell them about it , Desmond. "  | Mr. Desmond stirred uneasily . " There 's nothing to tell , " he said . " I took the wrong advice . A man 's a fool if he takes other people 's advice . " Gil eyed him as if to see just how far he could go . He must have seen some leeway , for he told us , " Desmond here owns eight choice corner lots in that future queen city . The land speculators sold them by mail . They might be worth a fortune someday . Of course , at the moment Red River City is just a name printed on the local maps . There 's not a single shanty , or even a ticket office , or a landing stage , or a drinking crib has yet been built . You know , it 's a pity I did n't accept the A.C.M. Company 's offer to sell stocks . I would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desmond . Then you 'd have something to show for your money . " Mr. Desmond 's face got grim . I expect what Gil was repeating was drinking conversation , which a man did n't expect to be blabbed to all the world once the last cup was swallowed . Mr. Desmond said , " I see no point in talking about that . The point is , I have less money now than I did once , or I 'd buy a proper rig for Emma to travel in comfortably and quickly to the West . " " I certainly could n't let you do a thing like that , " Emma said . " It 's beyond arguing now , " Mr. Desmond said . " Really , Mr. Desmond , " she said . She looked flushed and uncomfortable . " I 'm quite capable of looking out for myself . " " It 's hard to do without money , " he said . " How much are you carrying ? " She blushed deeper at the direct question . " Enough , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke in the firm , calm , even tone a man would use to an unbitted pony . " Thirteen dollars , " she said in a low voice . Then she raised her head and flashed her eyes angrily at all of us . " I know what you 're thinking , " she said . " You think I was just putting on in front of that mush-head my sister married . Well , I would have given her that thirteen dollars . And let me tell you , she 'll need it ! He 'll have those poor little children living in a shack and hoeing cotton before the summer 's over ! " Mr. Desmond said , " Well now , there 's nothing to get excited about . You outdo Gil by about ten dollars , and I 'm not too far  | ahead of you myself . I 've got the horse and my rifle and twentyeight dollars to my name . But I 've started with less before . " Everyone was thoroughly uncomfortable by now . If he were n't so old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have sworn Mr. Desmond was courting her . Frankly , I could n't see why . She had that ripe look , all right , but she must have been all of twenty-five , older than my stepmother , and she fancied unwomanly activities such as running newspapers . Calvin was as ill-at-ease as the rest of us , or perhaps more , for he had that way of always feeling right along with a person . His eyes fell on Hamilcar B. Burr 's poster , and he said , " What we need to do is win that thousand-dollar reward , and then we could all travel to the West in style . " I blushed for him , having to say such a silly thing to get people thinking about something other than Mr. Desmond 's possible intentions , but Gil sat up straighter and looked at the poster too and said , " How odd . I never thought of that before . I could surely use some money . Why , I could buy into the A.C.M. Company after all . We all could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up . " Mr. Desmond , too , regarded the poster , and so did Emma . Emma said , " A thousand dollars . That would be two hundred dollars apiece . " Mr. Desmond looked at her calmly as if wondering what she could do to help catch a bunch of murderers , and the thought struck me that he might be wondering the same about me , me being only fifteen . Calvin winked at me , maybe saying he just wanted to keep them talking . He said , " It would take some kind of perfect plan . You could n't do anything without investigating the facts carefully and figuring things out and then tailoring a plan just so . Pepper 's good at planning . Tell them how it could work , Pepper . " He was giving me a chance to show off . I admit that I proceeded to do so , mainly to demonstrate to Mr. Desmond that , fifteen or not , I was a person to be reckoned with . I said , " Well , of course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you talked with Mr. Hamilcar B. Burr himself . How was it those three men were slain ? " " Ambushed , I believe , " he said . He studied the poster some  | more , then told us what he 'd heard in Denton when he collected his money from Mr. Hamilcar B. Burr . The first murderee mentioned on the reward notice , Jason Waller , was the main robbery , they said , some thirty-six hundred dollars . I could n't understand why he had so much money on him , but Gil said there had been some nervous chatter about the bank in Denton , and Jason Waller had pulled out his balance . He had been knifed right while he was sitting in his buggy . Gil could n't remember what they 'd said about the second man , but the latest man to be killed , John Thomas Blanchard , had been robbed of more than five hundred dollars and killed not three weeks before . Stabbed in his quilts , they said , in his camp at a spot we would pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road crossed Denton Creek . No one knew who was doing the killings . People had gotten nervous about coming near Denton , and Hamilcar B. Burr , who was a big merchant , was trying to do anything he could to keep all the trade from going to other towns . That 's why he put up the reward . Well , I heard this through , then said , " The thing to do is obvious . Since no one seems to know anything about these robbers and murderers the trick would be not to go looking for them , but to make them come looking for you . You 'd have to pretend you were rich as Croesus and draw the robbers to you , for I see no other way a stranger could single them out and track them down . " Calvin egged it on . He said , " A thousand dollars reward .. . why , Pepper , that would make a stack of money two feet high . " I turned to grin at him , but the grin fell right off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were already money . Calvin was n't just diverting the others ; he was serious . So were they . Gil cried , " I know . I know just how to work it . " He pointed to Calvin . " You can be S. J. Boldini , World Famous Photographer , just returning from a successful tour . You 've made fistfuls of money . The Prime Minister himself has given you a sitting , and you 've sold absolutely everything to Harper 's . Pepper can be your helper . I 'll be your man . You 're so rich , you see , that you travel with a valet . Only it 's a pity one  | would n't travel with a butler . Butlers are much more impressive . " Calvin 's hand crept up and covered his mouth . " Oh , I could n't do that , " he said . " I could n't talk in front of a whole bunch of people . " " Nonsense , " Gil said . " With a name like Boldini people will just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll be Mrs. Boldini , touring with my world-famous husband . " " No need for you to mix in with this , " Mr. Desmond said . " Someone from Krum might recognize you in the county seat anyway , and that would give the game away . You 'd stay with me . I 'd keep low and wait at the camp , where we 'd spring the trap . Then they would n't know there 's a man around to protect the outfit . " Gil shot Mr. Desmond a glance that I was glad Mr. Desmond did n't see , but he only said , " Oh , let her come with us . A beautiful woman always attracts attention , and attention is what we want to attract . " Emma looked properly modest and moved her hand as though to fend off the compliment . Calvin looked flustered , too , perhaps at the thought of being Mr. Boldini while Emma was Mrs. But Mr. Desmond said to Gil , " I 'm not sure you could go dancing into the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been there , have n't you , picking up your money from that Burr fellow ? " " But I spoke only with Mr. Burr and his agent . Besides , I 've shaved off my beard since . " Mr. Desmond said , " Shaved ? Yes , now that you mention it . But I 've got to wonder how many **25;1175;TOOLONG Britishers with a funny accent Denton has visiting it every week . People might recognize you as the same man . " " I 'm considerably taller than just five and a half feet , " Gil said stiffly , " and my accent is perfectly normal . " " How much taller ? " Mr. Desmond asked . Gil would n't answer him , but that did n't seem to bother Mr. Desmond at all . He just went on thoughtfully , " It 'd take money to set it up right . Without money you could n't act rich enough in the town for the robbers to get interested . And if the robbers  | happened not to be hanging around watching for victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out . " That made my back get as stiff as Gil 's , but Emma said , " It takes money to make money . I 'll put in my part . " Mr. Desmond said , " No need for that . I guess I can bankroll the affair . I 've got enough for that . " Gil , from the height of his whole two dollars , said huffily , " Certainly not . We 'll all chip in . Wo n't we , Pepper ? " With what ? " I said . " Salt beef and blueberry preserves ? " Calvin said , " But we 've made some cash , Pepper . Does n't it come to near six dollars ? Ca n't we put in that ? " His face was pleading . I knew what he was thinking . He was thinking about San Diego and Mr. John Swiss Parker , and about having to take charity from family connections . But I firmed myself . If we pitched in together , we 'd have to pitch in equally . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old fellow who 'd got rooked by land speculators on a patch of clearing called Red River City , and that meant that it would be a large part of what was left of my money sack that would have to hold up our end . And for what ? Their hope to win that reward was speculation beyond the pale of any standards of practicality . I said : " Hold on a minute , now . Planning 's fun , but y'all have n't thought through the deep-down core of the matter , and once you do you have to give up all thought of things like big rewards . " Calvin said , " Pepper , does n't it make you mad , too ? " " What makes me mad ? " " Those killings . And those robbers going scot-free . " " Well , sure it makes me mad , but ? " " Pepper , you would n't have to do anything but guard my back . I swear , I 'll do all the rest . " " But that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's living bait we 'd have to be . What about Mrs. S. J. Boldini ? At best she 'd be sitting there , waiting and waiting , and what would she be waiting for ? Murderers with knives , that 's what . No , I did n't mean for the plan to be taken seriously . I was just funning . " Mr. Desmond said , " You would n't be scared , would you ? " 95  | The words fell on me like a fist . My ruined Claiborne Parish past suddenly seemed to reach out , blackly , toward this new life I had begun so cockily to lead . I jumped to my feet , and I do believe my mouth worked just like Cousin Calvin 's when he was trying to get out something hard . Mr. Desmond did n't say it nastily  --  nor sternly and contemptuously as I thought my father had  --  just thoughtfully , but how could anything like that sound nice to me ? Calvin grabbed my arm . ' We 'll pick the perfect camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very tip-edge of some bayou . Then nothing can come at us from that direction . And between the lot of us , watching the other sides will be easy as pie . " We 'd left bayou country far behind , so you can see how clearly he was thinking . " Let go my arm ! " I said . Mr. Desmond said , " Easy now . " Gil said , " Pepper would n't be frightened . He 's just thinking about Emma . " I said , " That 's right . " Gil said , " And I think he has an excellent point . Emma , you must n't stay with us directly in the camp when we spring the trap . We 'll stash you off somewhere safely on the side . " She said , " We 'll see about that . " Mr. Desmond was still looking at me speculatively . I loosened my arm from Calvin 's grasp and said , speaking directly to Mr. Desmond , " I have n't seen anything , anywhere , yet that scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you just have n't seen a whole lot up till now . " " Maybe that 's so , " I said , " but if there 's one thing in the whole world I 'm not , it 's a coward . " " I did n't mean that , " he said calmly . " A man can be scared without being a coward . It do n't matter what he feels , it matters how he acts . " " Well , you can see for yourself how I generally stand up , " I said . " We 'll do our share . You can count us in . " I walked off . The old dog , which had been lying next to Mr. Desmond , got up and followed me . Emma spoke softly to the  | rest and jumped up and followed me too , but I told her , " I 'm looking for a bush , if you please . " She fell back . She said , " Do n't be long . I 'm going to make another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . I went to the spring . The fox was n't there . Nemo came along , nosing every bush , lively after lying down awhile . The sun was just setting , but there was no color because there were no clouds . Except in my thoughts . In one funny way , maybe I was a coward , for I was afraid not of robbers nor murderers nor acquitting myself poorly , but of what the folks back home would think . They 'd have themselves something to whisper and laugh and condemn about for sure if they ever got the least hint that I was letting myself get mixed up in the world 's most cockeyed scheme with the parish 's second-most-talked-about fool , my Cousin Calvin , who I had edged out of first place ten days before on a hot May afternoon in a store loft . I did n't think about it long . The ones down there by the wagon might think I was off sulking . Or , worse , feeling scared . I whistled to Nemo and started back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with me . They 'd be needing water , and I felt that I was surely the only one in this outfit with sense enough to get it . 97  | It took more than one bucket of water and all the sense I could muster in figuring out the details for their risky scheme to get us even where we were by Sunday-school time the next morning : a few miles from Denton , with Calvin sitting all stiff beside me carrying the stake we 'd finally decided upon . This was thirtynine dollars  --  ten from Mr. Desmond , and eight from Emma , and half of everything Gil owned in the world , meaning one dollar , and twenty from Calvin and me , meaning the silver dollar with the X mark I got for selling the barrow and all of my greenbacks . So Calvin was stiff with responsibility and also because he was all dressed up in his good suit , with his boots polished , his last **28;1202;TOOLONG shirt glimmering like whipped cream where it showed around the edges of his coat and vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil insisted matched the blue of the What's-It Wagon but which did n't . From his pack Gil had pulled an even more astonishing outfit , the high points of which were nankeen trousers and a brown sack coat and a black bowler . He sat in it , not even looking uncomfortable , on the bench behind us , saying to a farmer he 'd insisted that I hail : " Indeed , sir , we 're very grateful for the information . An artiste of Mr. Boldini 's distinction can not be too careful . " The farmer , a small , skinny man with a strapping wife sitting beside him and two strapping girls sitting in chairs they 'd put  | in their wagon bed , glanced at me and Calvin . We had cautioned Gil about speaking slowly and clearly , but I was n't sure how much was coming through , so I said , " Much obliged . " " No trouble , " the farmer said , and he gave his reins a little shake and went on , his team laying into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd told Gil we should n't stop them , that we 'd make them lose the momentum the farmer was mustering coming down one little hill before going up the next , and now I told him , " Hell fire , Gil , we did n't have to pretend with those folks . They 're just going to church , ca n't you tell that ? They 're not going to turn around and rush into Denton and tell everyone they see that Calvin is n't Mr. S. J. Boldini . " " We really ca n't be too careful , " Gil said . " With the robbers ' identity unknown , we ca n't be sure of anyone , now can we ? " I got a prickly feeling . What Gil had been so interested in stopping and asking someone was if there had been any talk of any more killings or of the robbers being caught . There was n't , as far as the farmer knew , and the prickly feeling came only from what Gil had said : we could n't be sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as small , its outermost radius extending only as far from the center , Claiborne Parish , as Bay Tree , Arkansas , but I had thought it a fair sample of what the rest of the world was like . In terms of my father 's profession , lawing , you could look at it as a world covered by a contract , in which the individual person agrees not to murder , buffet , set afire or otherwise molest others in his group , the co-signers to the contract , and they likewise agree not to mount violent , unpredictable attacks on him . You could be sure of the next fellow you met , because you were both signatory to the contract , and if he did n't live up to his agreement , well , then you could shoot him or have him hanged , or otherwise sic the law , which was merely the codification of the social agreement , on him . At least that 's the way I looked at it until Otis Wasum shattered my illusions with his brother 's rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain country farmer who I happened to meet on a roadside gave me a feeling that I had somehow moved into a changing world full of maniacs . Mulling on that , I had left Calvin to answer Gil , which he was glad to do , for they 'd been palavering like crows in a corn-  | field ever since we 'd left camp that morning . In fact , they 'd been palavering since the previous evening , only then Emma and Mr. Desmond had still been with us to palaver along with them . Now the newest members of our party were gone , off to wait for us at the site I had reluctantly suggested for the trap , the same site where the last murderee had been stabbed in his quilts at the crossing of the old Military Road and Denton Creek . They 'd ridden on ahead at an easy Spanish trot , Emma riding double behind Mr. Desmond and looking a bit uncomfortable about it , and Mr. Desmond 's hard face showing nothing about whatever he may have thought of the ripe curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of me mulling so much and paying too little attention to the mules , we got into Denton a little later than we 'd hoped . Right off , we saw one of our posters pasted to a fence , and another poster that said : PUBLIC WARNING The practice of discharging fire arms within the limits of Denton , contrary to an ordinance of said city , having become so frequent as to endanger life and greatly annoy the quiet and peace of orderly citizens , I have taken this method to inform every one that I intend to enforce the Ordinance against EACH AND EVERY VIOLATOR thereof ; and if found necessary , will , by the authority of the Mayor , employ the secret police for the purpose of giving information against every one thus offending . William D. Shockley City Marshal " Secret police ? " Gil said . " In a town this size ? What does that mean ? " " I 've heard tell of it , " I said . " Some marshals and sheriffs take on local men to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IOI  | " And inform on their neighbors ? " Gil said . " That does n't sound very admirable . " He seemed shocked . Calvin read the poster again and asked Gil if he had brought his little pistol , and Gil said yes , but if there were secret police about , he would keep it carefully in his pocket and bring it out only in case of emergency . We were too late to be seen by the whole town as it got out of church , but at least in time to be seen by the late stragglers , the ones who always stayed behind on the porch steps to talk . We engaged in mutual staring . I must say the town fooled me . I do n't know exactly what I expected , but it was probably something gloomy , with dark clouds rolling overhead , and awful , sinful-looking people . I guess I was remembering pictures in a big book of Grandmother 's called The Bible Looking Glass . In any of the pictures which dealt with dark deeds , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything had a terrible look . But Denton was as fine a town as my own home town . Maybe it was even finer , for it was bigger . Downtown was very much the same , with the store buildings standing around a big square and the courthouse in the middle . There was plenty of sun , and boys just like me were cutting up , as much as you could on a Sunday . I had thought we might begin by just letting ourselves be looked at and then investigate things carefully . But no . That was n't Calvin 's and Gil 's approach . They started out right away making loud , noisy fools of themselves all over Denton . We did get to eat in a real restaurant on the square , but Gil and Cousin Calvin spoiled it the minute we got inside . " Mr. Boldini 's party , " Gil announced loftily to a nicely dressed man holding some menus near the door . When the man just blinked at him , Gil said , " Signore Boldini ? The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the man , and showed us to a table . Well , it would n't do . Much too near the kitchen , Gil said . Surely the man did n't think an artiste of Mr. Boldini 's distinction was accustomed to lunching with the sound of pots clattering in his ears . The next table would n't do either . It was near the front windows , and the sunshine coming in might disturb  | Mr. Boldini . They settled on one in the middle of the room , but Gil would n't let Mr. Boldini sit down until he 'd whipped out a black silk handkerchief and carefully dusted off the chair . You 'd think that Calvin would have been dying of shame during all of this , especially with him being as shy as he was around strangers . But no sir . His old mouth got to working and then words popped out everywhere and it was " This will do nicely , " and " Thank you , my good man , " and " Carmichael , a little something , please , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't lay a whole silver dollar , one I knew well that was marked with an X , in that man 's open hand . As always , I could tell that the man did n't necessarily understand Calvin , but he sure understood that silver dollar . And that was just the start of it . To me , the money part was bad enough , but even money was n't quite , quite everything in life to me . There were also little things like decency and manners and self-respect , but Calvin loaded them all in the same boat and promptly sank it . Gil would n't sit at the same table with us . He told the man with the menus that he was Mr. Boldini 's man and acted like the idea of sitting with his employer was the most improper thing he 'd ever heard , but after the silver dollar went into the menu-man 's palm the whole restaurant staff was quick to bustle around and move other people 's tables , where they were sitting and trying to eat Sunday dinner after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table for Gil next to ours . I wished I was sitting at it . Or farther away . As far away as the old Military Road , where Emma and Mr. Desmond were waiting for us , for Cousin Calvin barely glanced at the menu and instead opened his mouth and started calling me " My boy , " and " My dear young assistant , " and bragging about how much money he 'd made on his recent tour through the western territories . To hear him tell it , he had the most money and the finest collection of views and portraits ( no , not including England 's Prime Minister ; Calvin substituted Geronimo ) , and the most plates sold to the New York illustrated magazines , and the finest assistant ( me ! ) in the whole of Louisiana and Texas combined . All this he said in a loud , silly way that beat any way I 'd ever seen him act before . Gil kept jumping up and down to wait on Calvin , and he 'd repeat bits after him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of this information was lost to anyone in the restaurant . I was soon choking on the food , and I could barely get through it . As it was , Calvin had to tell me later what I 'd eaten : corn soup , and tenderloin of ocean trout with tartar sauce , and roast pork with dressing , and string beans and potatoes and French peas , and apple sauce , and a hard-boiled egg and beet salad , and vanilla cream puffs ( they were the one thing I think I really tasted and therefore remembered ) , and custard pie and coffee , all for the not-unreasonable price of sixty-five cents . But they managed to spend plenty more money than that , what with tipping anyone who came near no less than two bits , and some , like the girl who brought our plates and things , more than that . Though I expect all told it only came to about three or four dollars , it began to look to me like they 'd get rid of all thirty-nine dollars right there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the nicer people trying not to . I was forcing down the last bites of custard pie , which I did n't especially care for but did n't wish to see go to waste , when Gil pulled out what I could have sworn was a sterling-silver cigar case that I 'd never seen before and offered Calvin a cigar that I had no idea how he 'd come by . He lit it for Calvin . " Was luncheon adequate , sir ? " he said . " Would you care for anything more ? " " Naw , naw , " said Mr. Boldini . " I 'm full up to the brim . Ask back that head waiter and inquire what if anything of interest may be going on today in this pleasant little city . " That was according to my plan . Wherever the most people might be gathered , that 's where we were to go , to give everyone a chance to watch us act rich . That 's why I 'd thought of gettingout-of-church time and a restaurant . So Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him : " Sir , Mr. Boldini has expressed interest in what events may be occurring today in your city . Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us . " " Uh , public events ? " said the man . " That is correct , sir . " ' Well , a Miss Elena Mancera from Mexico is in a theatrical  | exhibition tonight at eight-thirty in the Cosmopolitan Hotel . She 's to execute a dance called ' La Flor de la Canela . ' That means ' The Cinnamon Flower . " " Hmm , " said Gil . " Is nothing scheduled for this afternoon ? " " Oh yes sir . There 's the base ball game between Denton and McKinney , and there 's some Fiji Islanders performing at sundown . They say that the old chief will bring out the leg of a man and eat it before the audience , and that the princess will eat a whole baby , all by herself . " A lady sitting well within earshot started to strangle , and the man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me , " What 's base ball ? " I stopped chewing pie . " Why , do n't you know ? " I said . " It 's a game . It 's ? " " A sporting event ? Fine , I thought so . Do men go ? Do they bet ? " " Ladies can go too , " I said . " At least at home they do . And some men bet , yes . " The man with the menus was coming back , and Gil said , " I believe you might consider the base ball match , Mr. Boldini . You might find it diverting . " " Is Mr. Boldini going to photograph the base ball game ? " the man with the menus asked eagerly . " Not on Sunday , my dear sir , " Gil said . ' Well now , I might make an exception , " Mr. Boldini said . " Let 's us just drive my fine portable studio to wherever the game is to be , and we 'll see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being held , and Gil asked loud questions about how to get from there to our intended campsite out where the old Military Road crossed Denton Creek . This mention of our intended campsite was according to plan too . The robbers had to know where to come rob us in peace if we were to spring our trap . We paid out , with as much fuss and throwing money around as they could manage . I went to get the wagon . We 'd left it right on the square , and three or four little boys were hanging around , looking it over . They followed as I drove to the restaurant for Calvin and Gil . Calvin started making squares with his fingers at the courthouse and saying loudly that if it was n't Sunday he  | was darned if he would n't take a view of that fine-looking courthouse , and the little boys started snickering . I 'd have whammed them good if they had n't been so little . Calvin kept up his craziness , talking at the top of his voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the way out to the base ball game . Gil poked me from time to time and told me to drive slow , drive slow , and we drove so slowly that the little boys who kept trailing us had an easy walk of it . We passed a big tent with signs all around it and a man standing out front shouting that at three o'clock Professor E. G. McDonald would lecture to ladies only on " How to Acquire Health , Retain Youth , Augment Beauty and Enhance Happiness , " while at sundown King Tamehameha and Princess Malama of the Fiji Islands would give their exhibition . Denton was beginning to appear to me to be the liveliest town I 'd ever be in , and I would willingly have driven slowly by the tent so I could look at all the signs , but Gil , poking me , insisted I drive fast at just that point . " It 's the one place I 'd expect to encounter Hamilcar B. Burr , " he whispered to me . " Not that he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably there right now , selling this evening 's baby . " The little boys following us almost peeled off , as if attracted by the Fiji Islanders ' tent , but then they kept coming . I guess King Tamehameha and Princess Malama had perhaps been in town longer than Mr. S. J. Boldini and the What's-It Wagon , so the newer spectacle won . Denton had a real , permanent base ball diamond , with wooden bleachers and everything . In those times , or even earlier , starting about the time the war ended , the whole country had begun to be crazy over base ball , not just in the North , where the big professional teams played , but everywhere , and Denton had apparently caught the craze . I could see the teams warming up , and I was dying to get to a good spot where I could watch , but I let Calvin and Gil out of the wagon and went to find some place to tie the mules . There was a big crowd , and I looked quite a while for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun to the west of the diamond . By the time I got back Calvin and Gil had gotten themselves  | surrounded by a considerable group of men . I snaked through , feeling anxious , but my anxiety was misplaced . Calvin and Gil were in no danger ; what was endangered was my hard-saved little collection of greenbacks . They were clutched in Calvin 's right hand , held high above him , and he was talking and laughing like a drunk man . " Naw , naw , " he was saying , " two to one is the best odds I 'd care to give . That McKinney team looks mighty good to me , but I only care to do a little wagering to add interest to the game . You boys go look up some McKinney folk if you want better odds than that . " " What did he say then ? " one man near me asked another , and it was a sure-fire indication of how much Calvin had been running off at the mouth that the second man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shoved hard to get to Gil , who was standing by , smiling superciliously and watching the fun . " My God ! " I said . " What are you doing ! " " Acting wealthy , " he whispered . " Do n't worry , we 're not really taking many bets . It 's just to make a show . " " Well my God ! " I said . " Make him stop ! " Gil gave me his measuring look and stepped quickly over to Calvin . " Your assistant suggests that you might care for a refreshment , Mr. Boldini . Shall we take some seats ? Shall I bring you something ? " " Sure , a lemonade might be fine , " Mr. Boldini said with a half-dozen crazy pops and pauses . " If you 'll excuse us , gentlemen , " Gil said to the circle of men . " Have you decided to take pictures of the game , Mr. Boldini ? " asked a plump , perspiring man in a banker 's suit and a planter 's hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plump man followed him a few steps , then turned back to me . " If he does decide , my wife and daughters just might be interested in having their portraits made by an artiste of Mr. Boldini 's distinction . Why , he could make their portraits right here . Al fresco . Ladies do sometimes pose al fresco , do n't they ? " I collected myself a little . I assured the man that lots of New York ladies posed al fresco , whatever that meant , and I asked him where he would be sitting in the event Mr. Boldini decided  | to take his camera out . The man 's show of interest offered at least a faint possibility of making back part of the money Mr. Boldini and his valet had been running through . The pair of them waited for me , a little farther on , and after I got through with the plump man I just looked at them and would n't go to them , and finally Calvin came to me . " Pepper , what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting his hand on my shoulder . I jerked loose and started walking . Calvin came alongside me , talking . " You backing down on me , Pepper ? " " Go away and spend some more money . Personally , I am going to look through the crowd for criminals . " His mouth started working , and it was longer than ever before the words would stop sticking and come out . " Listen , Pepper , we 're baiting ' em , do n't you see ? Listen , we 're hunting now , partner . You would n't back down on me , would you ? " His voice was n't silly any more . It was begging . I stopped walking . " Gee , Calvin , " I said , " is n't there some way to act rich dignified ? I tell you , my blood turns cold when I think of what any of our home folks would say . " " We ca n't take any chances that they 'll miss the bait , Pepper . Going fishing up at Bodcau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait in the water and sit there , do you ? No , you wiggle that old strip of bacon or red flannel all around , and pretty soon here comes Mr. Jackfish , his back fin cutting the water , and wham ! You jerk him out . " Well , there was no way to argue with that , no matter how much I hated looking like a fool in front of all those people . As if to make things easier for me , Calvin stopped being so loud and did little more than raise his hat to strangers and we stood by a lemonade stand and had some . Unlike back home , there was no liquor being sold on the sly , as far as I could see . Maybe Denton had been afflicted by the temperance movement . The bleachers were all full , and although I expect Gil would n't have hesitated to try to shoo people out so the famous Mr. Boldini could be seated , Calvin said why did n't we just stand , as many other people were doing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I tried  | to watch them and watch the crowd at the same time . It seemed to me we were getting a lot of attention from a big man with a big , important-looking hat with the tip of a guinea feather in its band . Two or three other less imposing fellows seemed to be with him , wandering off from time to time and then returning to him , milling about . One was a black man carrying a bucket of hard-boiled eggs that he was trying to sell . They all kept their eyes pretty much on us , and I asked Gil and Calvin if this was a man they 'd placed a bet with . " Which one ? " Gil said . I did n't want to point , so I said , " The big one , with the guinea feather in his hat . " Looking , Gil said , " No . " But looking elsewhere , Calvin sucked in his breath and said , " That nervy little sonofabitch ! It is him , Pepper ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " said Gil . " Otis Wasum ! " Calvin said . " Where ? " I said . Calvin grabbed me and whispered , " Are you sure , Pepper ? Are you dead sure it was him who did it ? " " What ? " said Gil again . I said , " Course I 'm sure . Where is he ? I do n't see him . Calvin , where is he ? " Calvin turned to Gil . " I guess you 'd better give me that pistol in your pocket , " he said , " for that little Wasum sonofabitch dealt our family a despicable blow , and I can not now question but that he means us further harm , and I expect it 's up to me to shoot him . " The crowd started to cheer and some to hiss , and in the madness I felt , I thought they were hissing and cheering at us . I whirled , my eyes going every which way in search of Otis Wasum , but I only saw some umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was holding his hand over his pocket to keep that little pistol away from Calvin . " I do n't see him , " I said . " You imagined it . He ai n't there . " " Yes he is , " Calvin said . " He 's there clear as day , over by that sandwich vendor . " Well , he was . Once Calvin succeeded in drawing my atten-109  | tion to it , the figure he was straining so hard to get at stood out in the crowd like a sore thumb . There , on a steaming June afternoon , skulked a man in a tatty buffalo coat , the collar turned up and the brim of a big floppy hat turned down . But the eyes that stared nervously out from under that hat were a familiar pale blue . No disguise could hide it . It was Otis Wasum , seventeen years old , from Claiborne Parish , Louisiana . He saw us gawking at him and ducked back . " That boy in the coat ? " said Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's no boy , " Calvin said . " He gave up being a boy the day he took up killing men in the streets . Now give me that pistol and stay out of this , Gil . This is a family matter , and I 'm the oldest , so I have to do it . " " But you ca n't do it here . You 'll ruin everything , " Gil said . " Wait , and if you feel you must we 'll get him off to the side and you can shoot him later . " " Pepper ? " Calvin said to me . He was asking me to throw in with him . To throw in with a matter concerning the family . I could see that Calvin felt required to do it , but I could also see that he did n't fully like the idea . I had a funny mix of feelings myself : rage because Otis had caused me to leave my home under the blackest of clouds , and rage because apparently Uncle Raleigh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas with blood in his crazy blue eyes , and rage because of poor Mr. Stein , provoking the call of family duty , but also a feeling of-yes , I admit it  --  fear , fear of just what family duty seemed to call for . That cold gust of fear confused me . Too many things were coming at me at one time , and it was more than I had rules for or could handle . But what was it helped me make up my mind ? It was my greenbacks . All the money we 'd spent would go to waste if I let Calvin stop being the rich Mr. S. J. Boldini . And all the snickering and staring that I 'd endured being Mr. Boldini 's unwilling assistant would go for nothing if I let Calvin start being a regular Fairchild . I said , " No , Calvin , no , no , no ! We 're just getting ourselves that nibble ! The man with the guinea feather ! My God , Calvin , are you going to ruin it all at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Calvin said , and he tried to wrestle that gun out of Gil 's pocket . I helped grab him and said , " Calvin , you said we was part-ners ! " All this was conducted in hoarse whispers , but with the wrestling and the whispers sometimes louder than they should have been , we were attracting plenty of attention . The man with the guinea feather in his hat was looking at us in a funny way , and other men lounging about also did n't bother to keep their eyes to themselves . Why should they , when we 'd worked ourselves to a frazzle to become the town 's major freak show ? Only Otis Wasum had stopped staring at us and had hurried to disappear in the crowd . Maybe he was loony , but he was smart enough to know that a Fairchild from Claiborne Parish might rise up , even in a public place with a thousand witnesses , to claim an eye for an eye . Calvin was trembling . He did n't seem to want to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely , and turned his eyes to the base ball field . I did too , in time to see a Denton player take first on balls . The game had started , but crazy as I was about base ball I could n't very much care . I kept looking for Otis , but he had flat vanished . After only about maybe two or three minutes of wondering where he was , I said I had to go under the bleachers to relieve myself . But what I did was , I went to the back of the bleachers and I climbed up on the scaffolding and I looked over the crowd trying to see where Otis could have gone . The man with the guinea feather watched me curiously , and I tried to look like someone who was just taking in the sights . I craned my neck to look out at all the trees and fields around the base ball diamond , as though that kind of thing interested me , and I got a little shock when I saw Otis 's heavy buffalo coat wending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diamond , kind of furtively , heading out toward a thicket of redbuds . I ducked down , not out of fright but just being careful , and stared at him as he hurried away . Then I looked out beyond him to see where he was going , and I got me another , far bigger shock . For out there , lingering in the edge of the thicket , holding two horses and waiting for his little brother , was Shirley Wasum. 1 II  | Oh lord , I thought . Uncle Raleigh was right about both of them . There was not one but two Wasums , just as clear as could be , not back in Claiborne Parish where they belonged , but here , at a Sunday base ball game in Denton , Texas , with no other logical reason in the world for being here other than the presence of Calvin and myself . I watched Otis hurry up to Shirley and I watched them talk with their heads bent together , like two thieves planning a bank robbery or something . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look , and I looked anxiously while Shirley seemed to shake his head and move back a step or two from Otis , then shake his head again and gesture impatiently . But Otis kept right with him , like Mr. Desmond 's old dog ( and maybe me ) with the parcel of spareribs . That drew my attention to the fact that there was a gaunt and ill-kept look to their horses , and Shirley did n't look like he 'd just risen from a filling Sunday dinner or a refreshing Saturday night bath , either . As I watched , finally Shirley started nodding a little , and I saw Otis nod eagerly and turn and start back toward the base ball diamond . I jumped down to the ground and fairly jogged back through the crowd to Calvin and Gil . " I saw Shirley , " I said to Calvin , low , where no one else could hear . His mouth worked briefly . " I feared this , " he said . " Where ? " " Out by some trees . Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not so as I could see . " Calvin scowled blackly over my news , but he shook his head twice and said , " Well , I guess there 's not a thing we can do about it now . Our friends ' money is riding on us , and we ca n't let them down . But be ready in case they make a move at us . " I blinked at him . Ready ? How ? As we only had one gun among us , and that in Gil 's side pocket , I did n't see that the advice was worth much . Nevertheless , I kept moving my eyes back to the crowd , watching for Otis . We kept on playing our rich Mr. Boldini game while the Olympics and the Mutuals played their base ball game . The man with the guinea feather kept watching us , and Otis Wasum , getting braver now that we had made no threatening gestures  | toward him , edged back into the open and watched us too . What 's more , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see those faded blue eyes of his go from us to the man with the guinea feather , then back again . Gil pointed out that we had another dedicated watcher as well  --  a middleaged fellow with a sour-looking face , who kept meandering around in the crowd , and whom two or three fellows kept coming up to and then going away from , just like the man with the guinea feather . One of the fellows , Gil said , had tried to make a two-bit bet with Calvin and had seemed quite inquisitive . He was a little man , about Gil 's height , and he scurried away from the sour-faced man when he saw us looking at him . I tried to pay attention to the base ball game , but that only served to worry me more . It was beginning to look as though we had bet our money on the wrong team . Denton scored a run in the third inning when a hard-hit ball bounced off the McKinney second baseman 's leg , and there was a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , at least four or five of them did . But others were not as active as I would have preferred , particularly for a team upon which Mr. S. J. Boldini had rashly bet so much money . I was especially disappointed in the second baseman , who looked feisty and fast , but who could not move well at the crack of the bat . Second base was the place I played back in Homer , and I really think I could have done better if I had been asked . Things stayed quiet in both their game and ours until the fifth inning , when Denton made the second run of the game  --  McKinney was still scoreless  --  and the crowd went mad with joy . That 's when our private game picked up , for Otis Wasum made a move . Not at us . He moved to the man with the guinea feather in his hat , and they started talking . Gil gave a low groan . " Goddamnit , that bloody well does it , " he said . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wolves to stay out of the trap . " Calvin looked at him so coldly that I said quickly , " Best call Otis Wasum no friend of ours . He is n't . " " Sorry , " Gil said . " What I meant was , if he knows you , wo n't he tell who you really are ? He 'll give us away . "  | " Maybe so , " said Calvin . " Maybe that 's not the right gang anyway , " I said . " Maybe it 's the man with the sour-pickle look . Or it could be anybody . That 's what you said , Gil . It could be somebody we have n't even noticed yet . Or it could be that man who said he had a wife and daughters to take portraits of . " " I guess it does n't matter , " Calvin said . ' We ca n't do more than hold up our own end . " And that 's what we did . We played our game out all the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McKinney finally scored a run in the next inning , due to some erratic fielding by the Olympics , but the umpire ruled that it did n't count because the McKinney runner had interfered with the Olympic short stop by pushing him down in the dirt as he ran past . At once , the president of the McKinney team rushed out onto the field and ordered his club to stack their bats . The crowd was in an uproar . There were McKinney people there , that was for sure , for there was plenty of arguing going on amongst the spectators and against the umpire . The tumult grew and the crowd swept out onto the diamond . They surrounded that umpire , but he had plenty of sand . He climbed up on a chair and announced , " I decide the game in favor of the Denton Olympics because the Mutuals of McKinney refuse to continue it . " Then the Denton folks drowned out the McKinney ones with their cheering , and Gil said , his voice pitched low enough so that only Calvin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has n't come for us to make a rapid departure . You 'll recall that we placed our bets on the McKinney team . " Calvin sort of sighed , as if between Gil and me he was in danger of forgetting what a gentleman was like . " That 's maybe not the best way to play rich , " he said . " Do you reckon these folks believe the distinguished Mr. S. J. Boldini of New York City would welsh on a bet ? " " But ? " said Gil . ' We 'll finish what we 've started , " Calvin said . Was it , in any part , deliberately to punish me ? I mean , for putting greenbacks in front of family honor and not letting him try to shoot Otis the minute he saw him ? I never knew for sure ,  | but then I never asked . What happened was , we stayed right where we were , until the men Mr. S. J. Boldini had bet with made sure that the forfeiture was accepted as legal and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calvin paid them as calmly as you please . Gil fell back into his role of the rich Mr. Boldini 's valet , and took care to tell as many people as he could where Mr. Boldini planned to camp when he left Denton that night , just in case we overlooked anybody in paying off our bets . There was n't much chance of that . Soon , the greenbacks had gone and Calvin was digging into his pockets for metal . All this was hard for me to watch , and fortunately it was n't necessary . There was still the man with the guinea feather and Otis who needed an eye kept on them . They were standing together , not talking now , but looking our way every once in a while . Why had Otis Wasum and his brother Shirley tracked us to Denton , Texas , instead of staying home with their family in Claiborne Parish , Louisiana ? Even if Shirley had broken out of jail and was on the run , why did n't they do something easy like heading up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they acting so funny and furtive ? Involved as I was just then in lying and pretending and trying to win Mr. Hamilcar B. Burr 's reward , an even livelier question in my mind was , had Otis told the man with the guinea feather that Calvin was far from being a rich photographer from New York City with an English valet and a young assistant ? I stared and stared at Otis and the man , until Gil punched me and told me to stop , but I could tell nothing from their actions . And then the crowd was leaving , and Otis and the man with the guinea feather and the two or three fellows who had been hanging around with them were leaving too , heading out behind the bleachers toward where Shirley was waiting , without ever coming very close to us . " Shall we follow them ? " I whispered to Gil . " Good lord no , " he said . " They 're the ones who are supposed to do the following . " His eyes changed direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickle-faced man . " Or him , " I said , because the man with the wife and daughters I15  | was coming by , but there was no sign of any wife and daughters , and he just lifted his hat and called out , " I see Mr. Boldini decided not to bring out his camera . Pity , " and went on past . " Shall we leave , then , and let whoever it is start their following ? " Gil said . We both looked at Calvin and waited for him to decide . " Yes , " he said . " We 're finished here . " But we were n't . Not quite . As we started for the What's-It Wagon , the pickle-faced man and two of his sidekicks , including the little man who had tried to place a twenty-five-cent bet , stopped us . Gil 's hand went to his pocket , as if to feel for the pistol he kept there , and Calvin 's hand went to Gil 's arm , as if to caution him not to rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their buggies sorted out and all , and I , too , judged we were in no immediate danger . I was wrong , in a way , for the pickle-faced man whipped out a city marshal 's badge and introduced himself as William D. Shockley . He shifted a big chew of tobacco to the side of his mouth and spat , and started in on us with his tongue . " There 's been enough trouble around here , brother , without damned fools from New York City trying to bring on more , " said he to Calvin . " Now you and these other two , speak right up and explain just who you are and exactly what you think you 're doing here . " Gil said , perhaps trying not only to shut Calvin up but to take up for him , " We already told all that to one of your friends here , when he came begging Mr. Boldini before the game to take a tiny twenty-five-cent bet . " The marshal cocked a glance at the little man with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Yes , they was acting funny , and I thought of the ruse to ask some questions of this man who calls hisself a valet . " " Next time you think up a ruse , think up one that do n't involve betting , " the marshal said . " Setting 's not illegal , " George said . " No , but there 're plenty of Baptists in town as think it immoral , " said the marshal . To us , he added the words of explana-  | tion , " New deputy , " and then he really lit in on Calvin . He roasted him good for the way he had been acting , showing money around and things like that , and he said that if we did n't cut it out and put that money into safekeeping , he and his deputies would be seeing us again . Calvin answered that he was going to go directly to his wagon and take leave of Denton right away . And that 's what we did . We kept our eyes peeled but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been for the What's-It Wagon , I do n't believe anybody would have paid any attention to us at all . King Tamehameha and Princess Malama of the Fiji Islands would have their chance after all . The town 's other main attraction left , with about an hour to go until sundown . I17  | We did n't see a trace of Emma and Mr. Desmond when I stopped the mules on the far side of the bridge at our agreedupon camping site , but then suddenly Mr. Desmond was there , standing beside a red oak tree . I caught my breath with a start . Mr. Desmond glanced at me , but he only said , " So you made it . We 've been kind of looking for you . " A long time later , it occurred to me that maybe he had n't been looking very hard . In fact , he had something of a disgruntled look , as if he would n't have minded if we 'd stayed over in Denton and he 'd had Emma 's company alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing problems , some named Otis and Shirley Wasum , and some who were nameless and faceless but who were murderers and robbers whom we had idiotically invited to call on us that night . I must admit I found it downright nerve-racking to be in such an isolated spot . Knowing that two Wasums were lurking around Denton County , Texas , worried Calvin , too , and we told Mr. Desmond we had a little problem he and Emma had better know about , and then , apologetically , told them . After all , if Otis and Shirley were to start shooting , our new cohorts might stumble into the line of fire . But no one seemed especially concerned with anything but winning that one-thousand-dollar reward . Emma just tsk-tsked that it was a pity those two young scoundrels had agitated us , and Mr. Desmond waved off the question of a traveling  | feud with a " Do n't worry , if you hear from them again they 'll find there 's a man around to help protect the outfit , " then started giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Desmond told Calvin and me to take the mules clear across the road to stake them out for the night where he had staked his horse . I could n't understand the why for this until he said we would n't want anything up close around the camp , maybe stamping around , to make it hard for us to hear any other sounds . The idea of those sounds struck me jarringly , and I was glad to have Calvin 's company when we went to give the mules a good big ration of corn and rub them down . The others stayed back at the camp . Gil was getting up some extra firewood , and Emma was getting up some supper , and Mr. Desmond was generally masterminding the last touches of getting ready for the upcoming events of the night . The events of the night . Thinking of that gave me the prickly feeling again , a feeling that seemed to have put down roots only that morning but was ready to bloom by evening . I did n't know what had come over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show by acting spooky and quiet , so , rubbing Old Jeb , I said to Calvin , " I told you it must have been Otis who wrote that note on our wagon . But what I ca n't figure is , how in hell did him and Shirley get here so fast ? " " Do n't cuss , " Calvin said . " Maybe they had to ride hard , but if they left Homer pretty soon after we did , I guess they had eight or nine days to catch up to us by the time we stopped to have our wheel fixed . " " But that 's over three hundred miles . " " Yes , if you make it by train as we did . But a couple of men on horseback could just cut due west and a little north and make it in a little over two hundred . " I finished rubbing down Old Jeb , who liked it and held himself good and still for it , and went to help Calvin with Young Jeb . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're sure doing a lot of cussing , " Calvin said . " And on a Sunday , too . " " You cussed this afternoon when you saw Otis , " I said . " I guess I did , " Calvin said . He was quiet for a minute , then  | tried to answer my question . " Maybe they just plan on waiting until they catch us off guard . " " Then they 're in for a long wait , " I said . But I remembered that I did n't have a certain Greener Io-gauge with me now , and I said , " You about finished ? Maybe we ought to be getting back to camp . " " In a minute , " Calvin said . He stepped back from Young Jeb and shook his rag , and Young Jeb shied as if he was scared . It was just play . Young Jeb was young , but he was a mule , and mules are smart enough to know that what you 've been rubbing them with is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting confused , or of thinking that a rag at one moment can change to something else at another moment . " Maybe it has n't got anything to do with a feud , " Calvin said . " Maybe they 're just mad because we said it was Otis and not Shirley who shot Mr. Stein . " " It was n't us that said it . It was me . " Calvin 's mouth worked briefly . " It should have been both of us who said it . You would n't have told it false . If you said it was Otis you saw in the loft , then it was Otis you saw , and I should have backed you up . If I had n't believed you , I guess I 'd never have been fool enough to think about shooting him this afternoon . I 'm glad you stopped me . " " Well , hell , " I said . " Maybe I should n't have . That 's been on my mind . It looks like I 'm going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " " No , you did right . Shooting Otis would n't have helped Mr. Stein , of course , even if I could aim well enough to have hit him . And Pepper , it would n't have helped the Fairchild name , either , if that 's what you mean . I was wrong . Getting yourself thrown in some Texas jail for killing a young boy is not the way you keep your family 's name clean . That 's old-timey . " I said , " Another thing 's been on my mind , Calvin , that I want to apologize for . It seems to me sometimes I spend all my life doing things that need apologizing . " " You have n't done a thing in the world , " Calvin said . " No , I did . You acted fine today , Calvin . You did just what we set out to do , and you did it fine , and I should n't have acted so thin-skinned and all . "  | It was getting dark , but I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted me on the arm . Then I knew he was smiling , because I could hear him chuckle . " You mean I did fine at making an ass of myself ? You want to know something funny , Pepper ? I enjoyed it . For once in my life it was fun , to talk big and brag and make folks look at you and make them laugh at you , and know that you were doing it on purpose this time for your own good reasons , and not give a damn if they was looking at you and laughing . " " Do n't cuss , " I said . Calvin 's chuckle became a low , deep laugh . But we did n't laugh together long . A dark figure suddenly stood out from the trees , and once again I gasped and started . Mr. Desmond said quietly , " What 's keeping you ? Emma 's waiting supper . " We went back across the road with him . Mr. Desmond wanted to ask us if we knew exactly what we were supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up and led me to repeat to him that he need n't worry about Calvin and me , we knew what we were doing and we 'd hold up our end . Mr. Desmond 's hard face flickered with his little smile , and he went on about his business . Gil and Emma had already started setting the trap . Only Gil was in sight by the fire , and Mr. Desmond stayed back out of the firelight . His dog wanted to come and greet us , but he spoke to it , low and sharp , and old Nemo stayed back . The dog could n't figure out just what was expected of him , and seemed bewildered and troubled . There was no talking . Emma , lurking in the deep shadows of the trees , gave us cold cornpone and some kind of hash made with salt beef , and we were allowed to sit by the fire with Gil and eat it while she and Mr. Desmond sneaked about in the rapidly gathering darkness . She seemed to enjoy it , but my vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in Mr. Boldini 's loud voice that he reckoned we 'd better turn in . He went to the wagon and fiddled some inside the dark-box and locked it carefully . Then he climbed into the wagon bed , where most of our quilts and some of the corn sacks and things were rigged to look like people were sleeping there . 122  | I retired as if I was visiting a bush . In truth , I did  --  a clump ' of blackberry bushes that grew near the creek . I felt my way behind them to the quilt we 'd stashed there and picked up my shotgun , which I 'd also put there to await me , and tried hard not to think about snakes . In a minute or so , the bushes whispered scratchily . Cousin Calvin came crawling on hands and knees to join me on the quilt . Our trap was ready . We settled ourselves back to back and pulled the quilt part- II 1 way over us , although the night was warm . We began our watch , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firewood that he had apparently picked up just for safety . In another station far to the other side of the fire , Gil was watching with his little pistol , and in still another was Emma with a big Smith &; Wesson 's D. A. Navy revolver of Mr. Desmond 's , and Mr. Desmond 's dog to help look after her , and Mr. Desmond himself sitting beside her with his rifle . From that point on we were forbidden to talk , and we had no urge to , so we said nothing . For a long time , sitting there , watching and listening , we heard nothing at all , either , but by and by there began to be some sounds . Even in the stillest woods , on the stillest nights , there were always two kinds of sounds  --  the far-off ones , like the bawling of cows and barking of dogs at farms somewhere , and close-by sounds , like the sound of a tree rubbing against another tree , or a bird complaining in its sleep , or maybe a night-roaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty to cock my ears at and wonder about , feeling jumpier every time our cooking fire sput tered or a chunk fell down into it . After a long time , a pale , bloodless moon came up , but there was heavy cloud cover , so it stayed mostly dark . Way off I heard some dogs begin baying at each other . Then there began some far-off singing . Colored church singing , I thought , since it was Sunday night . I did like to listen to colored church singing . We were so far off we could n't hear the words or the tune , but that seemed to make it even better , for that made it a kind of lonesome , different music , now high , now low , but lonesome and sweet . I23  | Cousin Calvin 's hand shook my leg , and I raised my head with a jerk . I 'd been dozing . I looked around , but I could n't see anything . I could n't hear anything at first , either . Then it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe some leaves rattled . The fire was low , but it still made a little light , and the cold , hard barrel of my gun felt good to my hand . The sound came slowly closer . Finally , on the other side of the fire , I could see something , dark-colored and moving , and I reached back and punched Calvin 's arm , to let him know that I was really awake now and watching . A burning chunk fell back in the fire and blazed up a little , and my mouth opened and got dry . Two shadows seemed to float up slowly near the fire , and then they were still . I could n't make out their faces , but they were both on tiptoes and trying their best to be quiet . They stood there a long time . Then one shadow seemed to point where Calvin and I were shivering and watching . I began to switch my gun around . There was a change in the shadow nearest us as it stirred and seemed to be moving toward us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , shook it , even pinched it . He must have been watching pretty hard too . There was a last , soft blooming of that faraway singing . Leaves murmured , then there was a faint rustling closer to us . My hands were numb from gripping the shotgun so tight . I sucked in my breath and thumbed the hammers back and tried to take a steady aim as the shadow drew closer . Then off in the darkness there was a muffled moan , like an animal sound . The sound was so startling that I almost pulled the trigger then and there . The shadowy figure , whoever it was , turned back toward the near-dead fire . After that there was a light rustling of leaves as the figure moved slowly back toward the wagon . A soft , tired sigh came from Calvin , and his hand touched my shotgun , and then he sighed again , as if he could n't help himself . I twisted around to speak in his ear . " I would have shot , " I whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have shot . " " I know , " he whispered back . " I never felt a bit worried . But  | I did kind of wish I had a gun , instead of just a stick . I got me something else in my pocket , something I thought might come in handy , but when he came at us like that , I realized it would n't do any good out here . Only up there by the fire . " I started to ask him what , but suddenly a voice spoke up , out in the dark , near the wagon : " I 've got you , you bastards ! One move , and I fire ! " " Oh good lord , " said I , and I forgot myself so much as to jump up and take aim toward the voice . " No ! " Calvin said . " That 's Gil ! " He started running toward the wagon . I followed him . " Who 's that ? " Gil snarled . " Do n't shoot , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But . . . ? " We rushed to the fire . Calvin threw wood on it . Gil held his pistol steadily on the two men . One I 'd never seen before , a small man in a dark frock coat and flaming red hair , as red as mine , redder than mine , and a red beard . But the other man I knew : it was William D. Shockley , city marshal of the city of Denton , Texas . Gil saw their faces in the firelight and his eyes bugged . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . He seemed to be speaking to the red-bearded man , as though he knew him . It was the marshal who answered . His voice was shaky , whether with fear or with rage I could n't tell . He said , " You better put that gun down , and you better do it right now ! " Gil looked confused . Before he could decide what to do , Mr. Desmond popped up by the wagon wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Get out of the firelight . Quick . " ' ' Gil did n't hesitate . He grabbed one of the two men and Mr. Desmond grabbed the other and they hustled them around the edge of the wagon , into the darkness . Calvin and I started to duck out of sight the other way . But there was a sudden rustling sound , and Calvin said , " No . This way . " I just stood there , rooted , my body refusing to stir but my thoughts a whirlwind . Who was that rustling out there in the trees ? Who else was in the dark , sneaking up on us ? Which way should we run ?  | Calvin tugged at my arm . " Pepper , come on ! " he said . And then as my feet finally started moving , the rustling out in the trees became a crashing , and a whole group of men broke through the brush and seemed to hang right in the edge of the firelight , between us and the darkness . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man who had been selling hard-boiled eggs and another man who was big and muscledlooking . And to my horror I also saw Otis and Shirley Wasum . " That 's them ! " Otis yelled with his Claiborne Parish accent . " That 's the ones with the money ! Kill ' em ! " My tongue came up big in my mouth . I tried to bring the shotgun to my shoulder , but my fingers were so twitchy that I somehow yanked the triggers before I even started to aim . I heard my gun bust loose and felt it kick back in my hands while it was still pointed upwards . My fingers must have given the triggers a real jerk , because both barrels went off at once , blowing a hole in the top of a big hickory tree . Twigs and leaves and a couple of branches came falling down around us . There was the damndest scared screech from one of the men , and a big , loud yell from Shirley Wasum , and then the man with the guinea feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging something my eyes fastened to like glue . In the firelight I saw clearly that it was a big , long knife . Calvin yelled , " Shoot ! Shoot ! " Then it must have sunk in on him that I already had , kind of prematurely , because he did n't wait for any more yelling . He clawed at his pocket and jerked something out with one hand and threw it on the fire , and yanked the shotgun out of my grasp with his other hand and swung it like a base ball bat . Light exploded like sudden summer lightning and Calvin slammed the shotgun hard against the leaping figure , and the man with the guinea feather stumbled , and then he rushed on past us . I was half blinded by the burst of light but I could smell fresh whiskey on the air as the man tumbled past us , which indicates how alert my senses had become , for the air as high as what was left of the treetops was filled with an even stronger element , the stench and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his James Flash Lamp . Well , the world went mad . There was a hideous , wolf-like growling and something flashing through the brush . There were  | gunshots . There was a cry of pain . There were confused yells and shouts . There were running feet . And through all of this I was still groping around , trying to see , until someone jerked me into the shadows and slammed me to the ground . Whoever it was jumped on top of me and I tried to fight back until Calvin said , " Be still , be still ! " And then there were angry men 's voices and a woman 's voice speaking up , and otherwise comparative silence . After a while , Calvin got off me and took me by the arm and gave me a boost to help me to my feet . " If they start shooting wild again , drop , " he said . I looked toward the fire and found that I could see a little better now . The small man with the red beard was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. Desmond . And there was a man I had n't seen before , a tall rangy man with a carbine , glaring at Gil and Mr. Desmond . The marshal had disappeared . So had the others  --  Otis and Shirley and the man with the guinea feather and the black man and the other one who had come out of the trees at Calvin and me . We went back to the fire . Calvin busied himself with my shotgun . He trotted to the wagon and unlocked the dark-box and came back with shotgun shells . He reloaded the gun . I stood by the fire watching him , and my face got hotter than a fire could ever have made it . He whispered to me that there was a dead man over by the wagon , but he never said a word about the way I had disgraced myself with the gun . I only hoped Mr. Desmond had n't seen it . He had been right about me , after all . And a little thought whined in my brain : could all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me too ? Because when it came right down to it , I had been completely , white-livered scared . With Otis and Shirley and those men yelling at us and wanting to kill us , all I had managed to do was to blow a hole in the top of a tree . That was the first time I ever succeeded in staying up all night . Sleepy as I got , while we stayed by that fire for hours and hours until streaks began to show up in the darkness and then turned into trees taking form in the thinning blackness of the dawn , every time my eyes would begin to close I 'd think of that gun and how I nearly got Calvin and me killed by my twitchy trig 11 127  | ger finger , and I 'd jerk awake and go back to helping our side argue . Because yes , there was a hellish argument going on . Mr. Burr had started it with Gil long before the marshal and his other two secret policemen got back from chasing Otis and Shirley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods . And yes , the small man with the red hair and red beard was Mr. Hamilcar B. Burr . This was Mr. Burr 's testimony : Having heard from the city marshal that there was a rich stranger in town who had made a dangerous display of his riches , he had talked the marshal into secretly bringing his corps of three secret policemen and Mr. Burr himself to keep watch at our camp and see if the heinous criminals who had been terrorizing Denton made a try for us . They intended to protect us , in spite of ourselves . They intended to catch , if they could , the heinous criminals who had been blackening the name of Denton , Texas . They had arrived late only because it took considerable police work to track down our intended sleeping spot ( Gil and Calvin both growled at that ) , and once they found us Mr. Burr and Marshal Shockley approached our camp only to reconnoiter and assure themselves that we had n't already been murdered . This was Gil 's testimony : Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee hours of the night , and having noted that their coming aroused no response from any of us , and having heard a moan from where Miss Prosser and Mr. Hap Desmond had been stationed , he had naturally concluded that the two intruders had murdered us all and had therefore taken them into custody . This was Mr. Desmond 's testimony : The moan had come from his dog , while wanting to bark , but while having Mr. Desmond 's hand over his muzzle , while Mr. Desmond carefully watched the two intruders . When the marshal and his other two secret policemen came back and joined in , this was the marshal 's threat : We should all be in jail , not only for being responsible for allowing the robbers ( the marshal and his secret policemen had recognized most of their faces in the firelight , including the man  | with the guinea feather in his hat , a well-known Denton man named Sidney Clinkscale , who sold butter and eggs door-todoor ) to escape , but also for somehow causing the death of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead body that lay by the wagon ) . This was Calvin 's question : Was George McGowan a new deputy marshal known as such to the world , or was he a member of the marshal 's secret police , or was he both ? " Balls , son , you ca n't be both known to the world and secret , " Marshal Shockley said . Then his face  --  it was getting to be good and light by then  --  turned red , and he spent two or three minutes apologizing to Emma and , for some reason , to Mr. Burr . " So he was only a deputy marshal ? " Calvin said , when the marshal finally ran down . Of course he was . " " And you brought him along as a deputy marshal ? " " No , of course not . I did n't bring him at all . " Emma was the first to see what Calvin was driving at . She said , " Then what was he doing here ? " " Why . . . why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his three secret policemen and at Mr. Burr , but they all shook their heads , and the marshal 's face got red all over again . He pulled out his plug of tobacco and bit off a chunk , then said that it did n't matter why , and the question was who , among all those rushing about and firing off guns , shot little George McGowan , because that was who was going to jail , and Mr. Desmond said : " I might have done it . At least I tried , and I usually succeed at what I try at . I 'll tell you this , I 'd shoot any sonofabitch that tries to kill my dog . And he did . Excuse me , Emma , but some things need saying . " " Then you 're the man who will hang , " said the marshal . " Tut , " said Emma . " He 's the man Mr. Burr will pay a onethousand-dollar reward to , because any fool can see that little George was one of the robbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Mr. Burr is n't paying any reward to any stranger . For one thing , the robbers are n't '  | caught yet , except for George , And we ca n't be sure he was one of them . " " But you will catch them , " Emma said . " You told us you recognized them all by the firelight , and you would n't have done so if we had n't set this scheme up . " " We recognized only three of them , " the marshal said . " There was two strangers with them . A man and a boy . We got to catch the whole gang . " " That was Otis and Shirley , " I said . " Otis and Shirley ? Who 's them ? " " Uh , " I said , and stopped . But Gil said , " They 're two young men from Louisiana who murdered a friend of my friends here not two weeks ago . Shot him dead in the street . Tell the marshal about them , Pepper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every good reason why I should , except for a lingering thought that Calvin might have been right and that the Wasums were something a Fairchild should attend to , or maybe it was that Otis was only two years older than I , and it was hard to feel it right to tell on another boy , even a boy who did what Otis had done . But the marshal insisted . I told . I maybe left some circumstances out and told it shortly , but I told it fairly , not only what I had seen back in Homer , but about its being Otis 's brother Shirley who confessed and was jailed for the killings and had somehow succeeded in escaping . " So there you are , Marshal , " Emma said . " Now you know the identities of them all , so catching them should be easy enough , and I must say we will appreciate your jailing those two horrid young men from Louisiana who 've been annoying our friends . I also say we 've earned the reward . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Shockley said . " And we 're the ones as will collect the reward . " " Now just a moment , " Mr. Burr said . " You 'll only be doing your duty , Marshal . There 's no reason a man following in his own profession should be given a reward for doing his normal day 's work . " " I 'm damned if you 'll give the reward to these strangers , " the marshal said . " Especially when it 's me and my men as will have to go out and face the danger of catching them . " " I quite agree with that , " Mr. Burr said . " These people have  | done nothing to earn the reward , but I do n't see why I should give up hard-earned money to a man who 's only doing his elected duty , either . I 'd say the reward is canceled . It 's only fair , now that they 've all been identified . " Calvin made coffee , because Emma was too busy arguing with Mr. Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun came up behind a still-heavy cloud cover , and we all sat there and drank coffee . Nemo came and put his nose in my hand . I let him lap the sugar that was left in the bottom of my cup . The arguing raged for another hour or so , the confusion of the whole event adding fuel to its fire . The way it all turned out , Mr. Burr refused to pay us the reward because he said we had n't really done anything but interfere with the working law . And he let it be known that he did n't intend to offer up any reward to the marshal and his men , either , particularly as one of the marshal 's own men appeared to be one of the robbers . And eventually they left . By the time they did so , Marshal Shockley was talking thoughtfully and saying , " I never was too sure about George anyway . Why , Mr. Burr , I think I even commented on that once to you , did n't I ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for what some little weasel like that might have done . " Only the mules and Mr. Desmond 's horse had gotten any sleep at all . The heavy cloud cover lived up to its threat , and it started to rain . We all felt pretty bad . Calvin helped me get the mules harnessed up . We did n't talk about the shotgun , because the others were around , and I do n't know if Mr. Desmond ever did know what I 'd done . We got into the wagon . " Come on , partner , " Calvin said , " cluck up those mules . You and me and all of us , we 're going West . That 's where true opportunity lies . " I looked down at the reins in my hand for a moment . " It does n't strike me right for a boy to be doing this when there 's a man like you around , Cousin Calvin . You cluck them up . " And I handed him the lines . 131  | He handed them back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just the man who 's lost all our money for us on a fool scheme , but I swear to you all that I 'll make it up to you . " Emma started jawing again , saying it was purely adverse circumstances and not Calvin 's fault that had lost us our investment . But Gil said , " Look here , all of you , I have the most marvelous idea . We 'll simply ramble directly to Tombstone , and I 'll pawn my aunt 's allowance to Freddie 's associates , and we 'll use it to buy into good old Freddie 's mine for all of us . Why , there 's worlds of time . We 'll get there long before August , and Freddie will speak for me , you see , about the allowance . There 'll be nothing to it . England would have died off a few hundred years ago if one were n't able to find ready-money against one 's allowance . " We all sort of looked at each other , and there was just the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon , and it was Emma who finally spoke . She said , speaking very nicely , " That 's generous of you , Gil , but you do n't have to worry about us . We 'll surely be happy to see you become well situated , though , and we 'll expect you to buy us a dinner of pheasants and oysters and plovers ' eggs so we can celebrate your good fortune . " " Why , why , why , " Gil stammered , " why , that 's nonsense . We 're all in this together , and of course we 'll all share . I absolutely insist on it . No , no , I wo n't listen to any arguing . Pepper , come now , it 's on to Tombstone for all of us . Er , er , cluck up them mules , partner ! " I did so . But as we started on down the road , I think I never did see a sadder set of smiles . 132 , Part Two  | During many a hard , dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's open-hearted offer to buy into the A.C.M. Company for us . For the first week or so Mr. Desmond flatly said no , that he would manage on his own with the Big Bug and gold , but it hurt Gil 's feelings so much that Mr. Desmond seemed to relent and started saying he 'd be happy to consider accepting a loan from us rich stock owners . Emma and Calvin also seemed wishy-washy , which made me impatient , for although I spent hours pondering whether it was really right to impose that way on a friend , I was anxious to get well launched on my rich and respectable new life , and accepting a share in Gil 's opportunity was a tempting starting place . It maybe seems a queer pastime for us to have argued that way about our expectations , for they were definitely at odds with our circumstances . Our money was not what you could call plentiful , and we had to stretch it over a good many weeks . Gil sold his silver cigar case in Jacksboro for seven dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy more glass plates and photographic paper and chemicals in Abilene , which hurt . But at least we had the wagon and Calvin 's profession and my business sense . And that 's mostly what we lived on , trying to find prospects who wanted their portraits made and piecing out the very last of our salt beef . Towns got farther apart . People had less and 135  | less that they could pay for photographs . Our assets dwindled . We did n't live very well , and June rolled by a lot faster than the money rolled in . I never saw that black-haired girl from Missouri along the way , either . Nor did we see Otis and Shirley Wasum again until one day after we had passed a town built largely out of mud called San Angelo and were approaching the Pecos River . Before that , we had twice more heard of the Wasums  --  once on a lawman 's poster from Shackelford County listing four fellows wanted for sticking up a faro game , with tiny letters at the bottom stating , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other time in a long letter from home which finally came to tell us what had happened . Uncle Raleigh sent the letter . It was not very strong on spelling , but he 'd worked hard on the words . Here 's what he had told us : The Rosa Bland , a sternwheeler that made trips up the Dorcheat as far as Noles 's Landing , brought up a boatload of fine mules , which , near the moment of docking , became frightened from some cause , rushed off the boat into the bayou , and all perished . Grandmother was rallying after Mr. Stein 's death and had allowed herself to be lured into making an expedition to Doyline , where the Fairchilds from Homer , the Leakes from Minden , and the Browns , Kirkleys , and Hutchinsons from Doyline all met and enjoyed a superb repast . Shirley Wasum had broken out of jail , as Uncle Raleigh had alerted us in his telegram , and in the doing had smashed the head of Louis Jardine , a deputy constable , who was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . Immediately , Shirley and Otis had disappeared from Claiborne Parish under circumstances that became clear only later . The whole parish was up in arms about the accidental assassination of Mr. Stein and the brutal assault upon Mr. Jardine ( a family man with three children under school age ) , and consequently a crowd of Homer hotheads had gone by torchlight to the Wasum home place and had dragged Mr. Wasum from his quilts and had taken him out to beat him and do him other bodily harm . Only the arrival of my father , the judge , had saved Mr. Wasum from a crippling hiding , and the hotheads were soon  | dispelled , with more than a respectable number of younger Fairchilds among them . Mr. Wasum was expectably upset , but declared that the judge had acted more than fairly , and stated he could only repay the judge 's fairness with a warning . Looking shamefaced and feeling bad , Mr. Wasum confessed to the judge that , upon the occasion of Mr. Stein 's death , he had felt it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why he had signaled Shirley to take the blame for the shooting . His feeling was that he and his other boys could spirit Otis away to kin in Mississippi as soon I as they could obtain a bankroll to send him with , then let Shirley own up to the fact that it was indeed not he who had shot Mr. Stein , so the Wasums could get Shirley out of jail . Unfortunately Mr. Wasum had had no private opportunity to explain this plan to Shirley . While Mr. Wasum and his remaining older boys had been engaged in a hog drive to Milliken 's Bend to get the money for Otis , Shirley Wasum , who was not known in the parish for patience or subtlety , took the matter of his release from jail in his own hands and had broken out , with the ensuing damage to the health of Constable Jardine . When Shirley came running from jail to the Wasum home place to get a horse and supplies for his flight , he found the house deserted save for Otis . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley out to the barn and talked a long time to him about the family honor and name and the damage done to it by the judge 's son ( me , Pepper Fairchild ) . According to the darky , Otis had not come straight out and told Shirley that a feud had started and that Mr. Wasum had charged them both to pursue Calvin and me to the death , but he had hinted at it strongly , and by the time Otis finished talking , Shirley was all lathered up and strong with the call of duty . The two of them had charged back to the house and had nearly torn it apart looking for money and guns and , finding none , settled for packing their saddlebags with eats , and rode off in the darkness like men possessed . To the judge , in gratitude , Mr. Wasum pointed out he did not hold with a blood feud for a number of reasons , chief among them the fact that , on a tit-for-tat basis , the judge had managed 137  | to restrain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was a Wasum tat in the death of Mr. Stein . His fair reckoning was that his littlest son , Otis , had lied to Shirley , and that trouble was in the wind for Calvin and me , if the two ever caught up with us . Mr. Wasum was distressed about it , feeling that now , through his folly , he had lost both his boys . With Constable Jardine sure soon to pass from this vale of tears , Shirley would have a death on his head , just as Otis had blood on his hands . But there was no point in the Fairchilds losing two ( us ! ) in return , so his suggestion was that the judge write his boy and young Calvin and tell them to give word to the two errant Wasums that they should straightaway telegraph their daddy . He would try to get word to them himself , to tell them to accept their exile and engage in no more killings , but it would be difficult with him not knowing where his two boys were . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , and there would be no resumption of the Fairchild ? Wasum battling . God willing , that would make things right . The letter , which closed with repeated warnings for us to be careful and keep our eyes peeled , had taken near two weeks to catch up with us , and it had come alone . I had to wonder why we had not heard from my father , if he had been charged with warning us as Uncle Raleigh had said . Of course the mails were n't too reliable , but still it made me wonder . The poster was also of particular interest to us , partially because of one of the other names on it . It was a name we had heard from the marshal in Denton as attached to a man who wore a guinea feather in his hat and carried perhaps the world 's biggest knife  --  Sidney Clinkscale . We could n't figure out if the other three men on the poster were new or not , since we had n't heard their names that night , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim Spoonts , a colored man " ? we figured we had surely seen on the night of the trap . We worried about the other two names , Cass Hubbard and John W. Angle , and we worried because the poster was from Shackelford County , which we had passed through on our way West . I worried mostly about a couple of things that seemed pretty clear to me : first , that Marshal Shockley in Denton obviously had not succeeded in catching Otis and  | Shirley and the others , and second , that Otis &; Company still appeared to be following our same route . But that was about all we could do just then  --  worry . The one thing about the poster that did n't cause me to fret was that nobody in our group had appeared the least bit interested in whether there was a reward being offered for these men , nor in trying to catch them . We seemed to have learned our lesson . We had traveled for weeks through country like I 'd never seen before . Flat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all but dry brown land stretching out in all directions and dry blue sky above that . And if you stood still , looking , long enough , the land seemed to start to rock slowly , back and forth , like a single wave sloshing slowly across a sea , then slowly sloshing back again , tipping the shores a little when it touched . To our relief , we were now in an area of broken hills and grassy slopes , and Mr. Desmond thought that during the next day 's travel we might be able to catch our first glimpse of a big cliff he called El Capitan , which he said was a landmark marking a pass through mountains on the other side of the Pecos crossing . I looked forward to seeing that and woke up thinking about it , but then the day did n't get off to what I considered a very promising start . Gil came out of his blankets acting silly . He fell to his knees and started yodeling , " Praise , praise , praise to the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him through tangled brown hair . " What 's bitten you ? " she said . Gil said , " Morning has broken like the first morning . " Emma yawned and turned over . Gil did n't mind . He only chanted , " 0 ye sun and moon .. . O ye stars . . . ye green things upon the earth . . . ye fowls of the air . . . beasts and cattle . . . children of men . . . bless ye the Lord , praise Him and magnify Him forever . " Mr. Desmond opened his eyes and looked at Gil with the kind of look that I tended to reserve for snakes , and I was n't sure whether to attribute that to my strong suspicion that Gil 's praising and chanting was just an effort to catch Emma 's attention , which Mr. Desmond would n't care for , or to the bottle of bust-  | skull whiskey that Mr. Desmond had consumed the previous evening , and which he definitely did seem to care for . Mr. Desmond had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Angelo , where he spent a full day looking unsuccessfully for some old pal that nobody in San Angelo ever seemed to have heard of . For that matter , Mr. Desmond seemed not to have heard of San Angelo , either . What he was really looking for was a town named Ben Ficklin , near Camp Concho on the North Concho River , which I figured might be well patronized by soldiers from the fort who would make good photographic prospects . But Ben Ficklin had been wiped out by a flood in ' 8z , and its survivors moved upstream to a settlement named Over-the-River , which was renamed Santa Angela , which then came to be called San Angelo . With all this confusion , I found it no wonder that we could n't unearth Mr. Desmond 's old pal . Worse , to me , we could n't unearth much business , despite the town 's being a busy place . As treasurer for Calvin and me , who were just about the only ones still solvent , I was holding two dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't strike me as a particularly appropriate thing for Mr. Desmond to have blown the last of his ready-money on that whiskey . It did n't seem to have done his state of health much good , either . At breakfast that morning , Mr. Desmond declined biscuits and drank coffee in silence , still giving Gil that snake-look , for Gil was still acting silly . Mr. Desmond had the suffering , redeyed appearance Grandfather used to get after he and Mr. Stein would stay up late drinking and talking , but there seemed something more to it than that to me , and I asked , " How are you feeling , Mr. Desmond ? Is your trouble bothering you again ? " " What trouble ? " he said . " Well , your lungs . You said once you 'd had some trouble with your lungs . " " My lungs are fine and so am I , " he said . Gil was prattling nonsense at Emma , the essence of which was that rural life had it all over city life . He proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " a simple garden , with acres of sky , " and Mr. Desmond was getting so tired of his joking that he looked ready to bite him .  | " You ca n't appreciate all this until you 've seen a city like London , " Gil said to Emma with a sweeping gesture . His " all this " was the same old brown dirt and a mesquite thicket . He went on , " It is only to the Sabbath , when two hundred thousand factory chimneys have ceased belching smoke , that Londoners owe the knowledge that the sky is sometimes blue . " Emma just said , " Do tell . " To me , she said , " We 're almost out of water . You should have brought more than just one bucket last night . " " I 'll go get more , " Calvin said . " It 's Pepper 's responsibility , " Emma said . " He was busy helping me take that view of the cattle at the water hole last evening , " Calvin said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . Gil prattled , " Marry me , fair one , and the A.C.M. Company will provide endless water , and we 'll raise dainty dairy cows and live on cakes and clotted cream . " " Marry you , indeed . I suppose you think you 're being funny . " " Well , yes , I did rather think so . " " You 'd do better to save your energy and go help Pepper bring up water . I 'll need at least two buckets , one for the breakfast dishes and one to soak a gunny sack to wrap around those cheeses . " In our biggest business deal of the week we had traded a portrait to a woman for two home-made cheeses , plus a secondhand wagon harness that I thought we could maybe get a dollar for at curb auction if we ever came to a town again , and Emma had worried ever since about keeping the cheeses cool and unspoiled until we got through eating on them . Well , Gil did bestir himself enough to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin had found handsome enough to waste a plate on the previous evening were still hanging around the water hole , and they 'd muddied it so that we had to wait awhile for the silt to settle . They were half wild , but bold , and did n't go far from the hole . They stood , watching us , and fighting flies that sat on their legs . " Pepper , you know how to milk cows , " Gil said . " Why not G embezzle us a little cream for tonight 's coffee . Emma likes cream . " I guess you should start learning that some cows give milk ,  | and some cows , range cows , I hear you got to knock down and sit on and take it away from , " I said . " That is , if you really have any hopes of marrying Emma and raising dainty dairy cows . " " Hell , man , I was only trying to amuse her , " he said . I liked that , his calling me a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you helped her through the morning , diverting her , sort of . I expect you 've helped her through a lot of days . " Gil made a little open-palmed gesture , as though he were trying to shoo away my words , although I had n't meant to say anything unpleasant to him , but the reverse . He said , " Do you think Emma is pretty ? " " I do n't have to think it , " I said . " She is pretty . " " She might be if she 'd take any kind of care of herself . I do n't believe she 's washed her hair once since we left Krum . Or bathed . " " Well , that 's her business , " I said . " Do you think she likes Desmond ? " he said . That 's how he confirmed my suspicion that his early-morning pranking had just been a way to try to get attention from Emma . The longer I traveled with her , the more thought I had been giving to her myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No . I think she likes him just the way she likes all of us . I do n't think she likes him anything special . Hell , Gil , he 's old . " " He 's not that old . Some women like mature men . He 's always touching her . Have you noticed that ? He 's always got his hand on her arm or her shoulder or someplace . Have n't you noticed that ? " I had n't . But I started watching for it . And the day was n't out before I saw it happen a half-dozen times . But first we finished bringing up the water and breaking camp , and we got the day 's travel under way . We nooned in a thorny tangle of dwarf mesquite and I think catclaw and almost surely some prickly pear , none of which threw much shade , which was what we were hoping for , but Calvin thought it was grand and picturesque and wanted to take a view of it . Our portrait business may have dwindled , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't . About every other stand of trees or sweeping vista or 142 ,  | towering bank of clouds we came across struck Calvin as just beautiful , and beautifully Western , and he had sent views to the New York magazines from Abilene and then San Angelo and would surely have one of the world 's largest , heaviest collections of views to send along after them by the time we reached El Paso . I 'm afraid Gil and Mr. Desmond both kept encouraging him , not in taking views , but in looking at all this dry , cactus-y stuff as something marvelous . Mr. Desmond was as proud of the West as if he 'd been its personal creator , and Gil was eager to see and admire and try to learn the name of every little twig of greasewood or sage or salt cedar that we passed by . We ate biscuits , again , and beans , again , and Mr. Desmond traded his Navy Colt for my shotgun and told us to start on without him , he and Nemo would catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually they did , somewhat sooner than we expected . Mr. Desmond came riding up fast and dropped three prairie chickens and two big jack rabbits into the wagon . Emma said , " How grand . Just look how fat they are . " Mr. Desmond smiled his little smile , but he said , " Pepper , quicken the mules a bit and ride on . We 've got company . " " Company ? " I said . Mr. Desmond nodded his chin at the trail behind us . " Men on horseback , " he said . " Maybe four or five of them . " I craned my neck . " Where ? " " A couple of miles behind us , " he said . " I headed back for the wagon as soon as I saw them , but I fear they may have spotted me . " " Who are they ? " Calvin said . " I do n't know , " Mr. Desmond said . " I did n't get all that close . " His leg , heavily muscled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of riding , moved slightly as he nudged his horse with his heel and moved closer beside the slowly jouncing wagon to lay the shotgun in beside Emma and take back his pistol . " Whoever it was , I do n't care for the idea of them trailing along after us , even if they do keep their distance . I 'd suggest a little more speed , Pepper . " So I clucked up the mules and set them off at a faster pace . Mr. Desmond dropped back maybe ten yards behind the 143  | wagon , watching the trail . Nemo , as always , followed closely by his horse , trotting to keep up . It was hot , and poor old Nemo 's tongue was hanging out half a foot . And that was when we heard that day from Otis and Shirley Wasum . Something whined rapidly past my cheek , and Emma said , " Oh ! A bee ! " Gil said , " Fear not , frail little woman , I wo n't let it sting you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the rifle shot . Then another bullet flew past us . By that time Mr. Desmond had come alive . " Whip up those mules ! " he cried . " Run ! " The mules had heard the sound too , and do n't ever let anyone tell you that mules are n't smart . Tired and thirsty as they were , they broke into a run before I 'd much more than popped the whip once over their ears . Mr. Desmond 's horse was galloping too , and he pulled up between the wagon and the direction the shots had come from . I twisted my head to look . I caught a glimpse of perhaps five men on horses atop a little hill to the side of the road . Just then the wagon hit a jarring bump , and I had to turn my eyes back to the road , so that one glimpse was all I got . One of the men was black . That was the only thing I 'd seen for sure . Within two minutes we were abreast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling his rifle out of his saddle scabbard , as if he figured the chaparral would shield us from their view from now on , and he could turn his attention to other business . I heard him fire twice . If there were any more shots from the men on the hill , they did n't come close . Somehow the wagon withstood our rapid flight without apparent damage , which is more than I could say for myself . I was too busy with the mules to do more than wish I was a grown man and had a horse and a rifle and was back with Mr. Desmond trying to help , but I wished it hard . The mules did n't want to keep up a gallop for more than a couple of miles , and soon Mr. Desmond caught up with us again and signaled to me that it was all right to let Old and Young Jeb continue along in the fast trot they were trying to settle into . We stayed at that pace until he judged the men had been dis-144  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , then he waved us to a walk . " Who was it ? " I called to Mr. Desmond . Gil had his little pistol out , and now he looked up at Mr. Desmond fiercely . " It was that pair from Louisiana , " he said . " Otis and Shirley ? " I said . " Are you sure ? Did you see them ? " Gil nodded , still looking angry and fierce and determined . " Them and three others . Desmond led them right to us . Desmond the great pioneer . " Mr. Desmond tightened his mouth and said , " All that can wait . We 'll stop for the night in a couple of hours . I 'm going to ride on ahead to look for a safe place for us to hole up . " To me , he said , " You 'll want to keep your shotgun handy . " Emma handed me the shotgun meekly , and Mr. Desmond rode off ahead of us at a trot . Gil kept his little gun in his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Calvin kept watching behind us . And that 's the way it happened . I stayed on the road until Mr. Desmond came riding back for us later that afternoon and led us to a catch basin shielded by high rocks on three sides in a big patch of chaparral . He told me to pull the wagon in amongst the rocks , which I did . Gil leapt out . " We should n't have run ! " he said . " We should n't have run ! " I sympathized perfectly , but I did n't say anything . Mr. Desmond only said , " I 'm going to check around those rocks to make sure everything is all right . Gil , you take your pistol and look around the brush . " He glanced at my shotgun . " You stay here with Emma , Pepper . " I knew he only wanted me to stay behind because I had the next-best weapon to his , the shotgun , and he wanted it available to defend Emma , but staying behind just added to my feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was ashamed because we had run , but it was n't only that . I was mostly ashamed simply because we 'd actually been shot at . Otis and Shirley Wasum had obviously found themselves guns by now , and had picked them up and aimed them at us and pulled the triggers , just as Mr. Desmond had shot at the three prairie chickens and two rabbits that were lying dead in the wagon . It seemed a 145  | queerly contemptuous act , as if we were of no more importance than those three dead birds and two dead rabbits . But that was n't quite it , either . It seemed to diminish me , somehow , for someone to treat me that way , and that was all I knew , and that was what I was ashamed of . And , also , although I told myself that I 'd wanted to stop and fight , I knew that I had once again been afraid . That made me so ashamed that I felt sick to my stomach . Calvin helped Emma out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket that looked too dense even for a lizard to get through . Mr. Desmond came back in five or ten minutes , and Gil came back five or ten minutes after that . " Nothing , " Gil reported . " Me too , " Mr. Desmond said . He took Emma 's elbow and pulled her out from behind the wagon . " It 's nothing to worry about now . " Calvin said , " It really was the Wasums . Gil saw them , and I did too . I also saw that Sidney Clinkscale . I could n't be sure about the two other men . " " One was a nigger , " Gil said . " He 's surely one of the same group . " Mr. Desmond said to Emma , " Why do n't you go have a look at the basin . It 's not very clear , but it 's drinkable . " " Anything you have to discuss you can discuss around me , " she said . " There 's nothing to discuss , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a bad place to wash . We 've got plenty of dirty clothes stacked up . " She did what he told her . I was never so surprised . Mr. Desmond watched her a minute , then he said , " I guess I know from what you 've told us why those boys from Louisiana are still on your trail and took those potshots at you , but you got any ideas why that gang is helping them ? " " No , " said Calvin . " I 've been wondering too . " " I 've got to say I do n't much like it , " Mr. Desmond said . " People taking potshots could be mighty dangerous . " He did n't say it unkindly , but I suppose he did n't say it kindly , either . He just said it quietly , his eyes bloodshot but thoughtful , his face hard but calm . I knew he was thinking about Emma and did n't really give a damn about the rest of us. 146  | I mumbled , " We warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trouble . " " I know you did , " he said . " Well , " I said , " I guess Calvin and me will just have to get out . I know we ca n't split up now , but maybe when we get to El Paso we can finally make some money and buy a train ticket or that rig for Emma , and the rest of you can travel on in style . We about splitting up , " he said . Then he waited for a minute as if to see if Gil or Calvin or I had anything else to say , and said , " All right , we 'll worry when the time comes to worry . " He strolled away after Emma . Well , there were animal tracks all around the catch basin , but just one set of fresh horse tracks , which Mr. Desmond said were his roan 's . He looked over the rest and said deer and coyote and raccoon and civet cat . He said we 'd have to keep our eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and howling all night long . Emma did n't like the idea of camping where all sorts of wild animals came prowling around , but water was n't easy to find in those parts , and Mr. Desmond was averse to moving on , so we stayed put . It was early . Neither Emma nor Mr. Desmond set me to rushing around doing chores as they often did . I went and got my portmanteau and took out Uncle Raleigh 's letter that told about Otis and Shirley Wasum . Calvin came to sit beside me . He 'd heard the letter before a number of times . We all had , for getting a letter was an event , and since Calvin and I were the only two in our outfit whose family knew more or less where we expected to be and could send mail , we read our letters out loud and shared them . I read the part again about Otis and Shirley Wasum coming after us , and old Mr. Wasum telling my father to warn us , although I already knew it practically by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did n't the homefolks trust me enough to listen when I told them about Otis ? Then they could have hanged him straight off , and we would n't be in this mess . " " Do n't cuss , " Calvin said . 147  | " I 'm beginning to think that if I 'm old enough to get shot at , I 'm old enough to cuss , " I said . That was one of the new things we said . We had sat and wondered many times before about Otis and Shirley , and what possible good Mr. Wasum 's suggestion to my father would do , since Otis and Shirley were hardly likely to sit down and parley with Calvin and me long enough for us to tell them to write home and ask for news from their father . And we had wondered whether Otis and Shirley were now making a living robbing faro games and things like that , and whether Mr. Jardine had died and made a real murderer of Shirley , just as his brother Otis was a murderer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually trying to follow us as Uncle Raleigh 's letter had said or whether it could possibly be by chance that their trail was leading them along in the same direction as us . But now that the Wasums had shot at us between San Angelo and the Pecos , that last question was decided in our minds and we had a new one to trouble us , that of their three companions and why they were also shooting at us . " You think we ought to telegraph the family and tell them about seeing Otis and Shirley today and what they did ? " I said . " We already wrote the family about seeing them in Denton , " Calvin said . " But you know how uncertain letters can be . " " There 's nothing they could do about it , " Calvin said . " Then what about us ? What can we do ? " " Nothing , " Calvin said . " Nothing but keep our eyes peeled better . " And that 's what we did . Nothing . To be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing base ball with Gil . It was his idea . All I wanted to do was sit by myself and brood . But the moment I got to brooding good , here came Gil clamoring that he wanted a bath , and the catch basin was big enough to swim a stroke or two in , and I had best come in with him . Emma started right in on the washing , though , and Gil could n't get close to the catch basin , so he prodded me to drag my dirty clothes for Emma out of my port-148  | manteau , and as I did he discovered a base ball that I 'd brought along . To hear Gil tell it , base ball was a compound of rounders and cricket , played with an ash staff about the length of a cricket bat , but round and larger at the striking end than at the handle . ' I could n't figure out what on earth he was talking about , but he 'd worked out all sorts of explanations , such as that the batsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bowler the pitcher and there was no slip field or off field or on field but just an outfield . He proclaimed that as he was adept at both cricket and rounders  --  which he said was a game and not a sport and played only at picnics or the beach  --  he thought he could do fairly well at base ball , and so we must all play . And to tell the truth , he was very good . Mr. Desmond did n't play with us . He took his rifle and sat next to Emma by the catch basin and kept an eye on the open end of our campsite and simultaneously conversed with Emma while she scrubbed away at a pretty good pile of dirty clothes that we 'd accumulated . But Calvin played , and Nemo helped chase , and for a while we had a good time , swinging away with a piece of mesquite branch we 'd tried to trim to the proper size , and dodging thorns that were there waiting for us every time we got a pretty good connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to see whether she was seeing how well he did , but when she would n't pay any attention to him and kept conversing with Mr. Desmond , he finally said that was enough exercise for one day , and why did n't he help me clean the prairie chickens and jack rabbits so we could start getting ready for supper . What he meant , of course , was that I 'd clean and he 'd watch . That was just like him . And just like Mr. Desmond , too . When it came to chores , like scrubbing dirty clothes or skinning slippery rabbits , they always thought of Emma and me . For more than one reason , I could hardly wait until I was a grown-up man . I declined Gil 's aid and he wandered off into the chaparral , and Nemo went to flop beside Mr. Desmond , and Calvin got out his camera . He came to the catch basin , where I was working on the rabbits , to beg Emma if she would n't consider sitting for a portrait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma , " he said , " and I think I could make a portrait of which I could be truly proud . " Emma laughed , looking flustered but nice , but she said , " Good heavens no . Ca n't you see I 'm busy ? Besides , I must look like something the cat dragged in . " " No you do n't , " Calvin said . " You look natural and busy and your hair gets curly as can be when it slips from its pins . You look like a nymph might look if she decided all her best tunics was dirty and she 'd better do a little washing . " Emma laughed , but she kept saying no . " Who else do you suppose is going to finish the clothes ? " she said . " I 've heard from no volunteers . " She had already done our shirts and drawers and was working on her own things now . She doused a set of long pink stays up and down in the catch basin , then began to wring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calvin looked away , and I looked down at the rabbit . " I 'll fix supper , " I said . I looked up and discovered that Mr. Desmond was staring at me , but I stiffened my spine and went on stoutly , " I 've fried chickens before , and I guess I can fry prairie chickens and rabbit . " " You do n't know how to make biscuits , " Emma said . " No , but I can make pone , and we 're near out of wheat flour anyway . " Well , " she said , " I consider that a very gentlemanly offer , Pepper . " " Pepper ca n't cook , " Mr. Desmond said . I was looking straight at him , but he reached out and took Emma 's bare arm and turned her toward him , and I was suddenly reminded of the way some men break horses , a way they learned in the old days from the Indians , some people said , in which you slowly , slowly acquaint the animal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to ride the animal , it just lets you , without much fight at all . It was not that he was caressing her or anything like that . He just touched her , casually , like a man who unthinkingly touched whatever he was looking at , without meaning harm , but I saw that Emma seemed to breathe in a different way , and in a second or two she had slipped her arm out of his grasp and was reaching for the bar of yellow soap to suds a cotton petticoat . I cleared my throat and said , " Sure I can cook , enough for a 150  | camp . It 's the least I can do after Emma 's doing my washing . You just let me take care of things . " Then we heard a wild whooping from Gil . Nemo began to bark furiously , and I cursed , I fear in Emma 's hearing , and jumped up , thinking of my shotgun , which I had let get out of my vicinity and had left leaning up against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle and was on his feet and swinging it up toward the sound of Gil 's voice before I could count to three . Gil came rushing out of the mesquite , grinning broadly . He was bare-chested , his naked breast showing scratches from a dozen thorns , and carefully cradling something in his shirt . " Look , Emma ! Look what I 've found , " he cried . " No , excuse me , do n't look . Look the other way for a second . " " You almost found a bullet in your gut , " Mr. Desmond said in a cold , quiet voice that you could barely hear over Nemo 's continued barking . " What 's the matter with all of you ? Give me your hat , Calvin . Look . I found a nest . They 're eggs , and they look fresh . What are they , do you suppose ? Are they prairie-chicken eggs ? " Emma did n't exactly look away from his bare skin , but she did keep her eyes on the eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seven of them . There 's an egg for everyone , and two left over . " Gil laughed jubilantly . " Lady and gentlemen , how will you have your eggs this evening ? Rabbits . Prairie chickens . Cheeses . Fresh eggs . Who said a man needs money to get along in this world ? Why , we have n't had to pay a penny , but we 'll have an absolute feast . " Then his face suddenly went green-white , and he stared behind us , to the rocks atop the catch basin . A strange voice roared : " Stamumderimmer ! " 151
