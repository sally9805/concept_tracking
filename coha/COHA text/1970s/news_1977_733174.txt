txt PUMP STATION NO . S. Alaska API ? The trans-Alaska pipeline will be put back in operation " in days , not weeks , " after a deadly explosion that halted the flow of oil through the huge engineering project . Edward Patton , chief executive officer of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. , said Saturday he could n't give a precise time for the resumption because several federal agencies will want to review the plan before it is implemented . But he said the delay will be measured in days . Patton also said the explosion at Pump Station No . II is " probably going to come down to human error . " IIE INDICATED that while oil resumption is possible without the pumps here , Alyeska Is uncertain that it will be able to meet its short-term schedule for oil delivery . The pipeline consortium had planned to bring the line up to 1.2 million barrels a day by the year 's end . Patton said that without pump No. 0 , pipeline capacity volume would be considerably higher than 600,000 a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that in terms of a 25-year project , the delay would be insignificant . Patton also disclosed that the single fatality suffered in the explosion involved a worker who went into the area in an effort to help put out the fire . And he confirmed reports from workers that a faulty check valve was at least partially responsible for the incident . MEANWHILE , A state official said the pipeline ' could resume operation in less than a week if engineers are able to bypass the station which was demolished in the blast . He said it might be physically possible to restart in a couple of days , but Alyeska will likely move very cautiously . In Washington , the Department of Transportation confirmed that the pipeline apparently is intact despite Friday 's blast , which killed one workman and injured five . It was the second major mishap to force a pipeline shutdown in less than a week at the station , about 41 miles southeast of Fairbanks at mile 488 on the 800-mile $7.7 billion line . Damage will exceed $5 million , a spokeswoman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pipeline Tribune Naval petroleum No. 4 ? 7 ) - . 7 Firefighters from nearby Eielson Air Force Base pour water on the smoldering ruins of the main building at Pump Station No. 8 on the Alaska pipeline . The station is located 25 miles southeast of Fairbanks . Flow of Alaska oil to start after probe // urn of oil companies running the pipeline , said Saturday . THE EXPLOSION apparently was touched off when oil leaked through a malfunctioning check valve into the pumphouse and ignited . It reduced the building to a twisted , blackened maze of steel . Richard Burton , Alaska public safety commissioner , said officials do not believe sabotage was involved . He said it " was strictly an industrial accident .. . It was just one of those accidents . " The tremendous blast was heard six miles away . Burning oil flowed from the shattered building and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of pipeline construction equipment and a stand of birch trees . Units from the fire department at nearby Eielson Air Base were on the scene within minutes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on surrounding property . The dead man , burned beyond recognition , was identified by a check of employes known to have been in the building as technician Charles Lindsey , 39 , of Fairbanks . MEANWHILE , an inspection team reported that other crucial facilities near the main pump building apparently were not seriously damaged . That means it should be possible to bypass the damaged pump building . Chuck Champion , state pipeline coordinator , said the shutdown might last less than a week if engineers can bypass the damaged building . . Champion , the state official with overall responsibility for the pipeline , said he determined that the blast resulted from the malfunctioning check valve , but said he also understands that some " human error " was involved . Alyeska had no immediate comment on that . ALYESKA WAS a few hours ahead of its timetable for getting oil to Valdez before the explosion forced the shutdown of the oil flow . Oil movement began June 20 , and Alyeska had predicted that it would take about 30 days to reach the port of Valdez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest problem , but the consortium does not want to underestimate it . The first shutdown Monday came after liquid nitrogen cracked a pipe section ahead of the oil .
