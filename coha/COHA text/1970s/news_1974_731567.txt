txt Letter to the Editor pg . 489 Letters : Eurailpassi Stops at the Border To the Editor : Owners of the Eurailpass should be made aware that when traveling to Berlin it is necessary to pay the East German conductor a supplementary fare , because East Germany , like the rest of the European Communist bloc , does not honor the pass . Although it is stated in fine print on the back of the pass that it is not valid in Communist sectors , one can imagine that many unsuspecting rail travelers have and will continue to assume incorrectly that the journey to West Berlin requires nothing more than the routine presentation of pass and passport . In my case , on a journey from Hanover to Berlin , I was asked by an East German conductor for 19 West German marks . He stared at my 50 East Germanmark note and srowled , " Nein , nein . " I had only about six West German marks . Fortunately the man sitting next to me was from Queens ( teaching English at a German university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , I must assume I wotild have been put on the next train back to the West ? in effect , deportation  --  or that the gendarmes would have been summoned on our arrival in Berlin . The Eurailpass sponsors should make , clear to purchasers that this situation exists , There was an exasperation in the conductor 's voice that suggested that I was n't the first dummkopf Amerlhaner he had encountered . MARK GROSSMAN Brooklyn A spokesman for the Eurailpass Executive Committee comments : We make every effort in all our literature to impress upon purchasers that the pass is valid in the 13 countries served by the pass 's sponsoring railroads . The 13 countries are all in Western Europe . GRAPE PICKING To the Editor : Many thanks to Patricia Roberts for bringing back happy memories of many vendange seasons in France , in her article , " Wanted in France  --  Grape Pickers " ( Travel Section , Aug. 11 ) .

We children used to enjoy packing the red grapes into the vats by trampling them with our bare feet , with bees es our constant companions . We stayed red ( hands , legs and feet ) for weeks after , Nothing has even tasted as sweet as the two-to-four-day-old " new " wine : after a few cups full , we would be sound asleep on the haystacks .

A Mere Handful  --  Are Alive and Well in Maine " ( Travel Section , Aug. 25 ) is everything author Gloria Hutchinson said and more .

MARY-JO LA DUKE Framingham , Mats . To the Editor : The " film " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have premiered at the recent bicentennial celebration at Sabbathday Lake was not a film but a videotape , and it was not called " The Shakers " but " Shakerism : The First Two Hundred Years , " of which we are the producers .

MAYORS ' COURTS To the Editor : " Frontier Justice : A Run-In With the Law " by Whitney North Seymour Jr . ( Travel Section , July 21 ) was published with a box headed " Proceed With Extreme Caution , " which reported that the U.S. Department of Transportation compiled a list of " backroom justice " states where the officials of mayors ' courts derive their salaries from fines paid by motorists . The facts are that on Nov. 14 , 1972 , the Supreme Court struck down the fee system of mayors ' courts in all 17 states in which that antiquated system existed . My organization financed the Supreme Court battle , which was won with a 7-2 decision , thus allowing hapless motorists like Mr. Seymour to proceed on their merry way with less fear of harassment than previously .

MICHAEL PARKHURST Editor-Publisher Overdrive Magazine Los Angeles George D. Brandt of the D.O.T . ' s Office of Driver and Pedestrian Programs comments : The Supreme Court did indeed outlaw the feesystem mayors ' courts in 1972 , hut the Department of Transportation indicates that very few states have taken action to rid themselves of these courts . The test of unconstitutionality laid down by the supreme Court was that a substantial part of the municipalities ' revenue be ae ? ived from traffic fines and forfeitures from such courts . To make a determination would require an audit review of every municipality with a mayor 's court . Currently , the only state audits performed are to Ansure that the state has been receiving its traffic fine and forfeiture revenue .
