Economists have long disputed the idea that they practice " the dismal science , " but when TIME 'S Board of Economists met last week to assess the state of the U.S. economy " dismal " was about the only word to describe their forecasts . In perhaps their gloomiest session ever , the economists predicted a continuation throughout the year of all the nation 's present economic woes : torrid inflation , skyscraping interest rates , sluggish growth , stubborn unemployment , a deepening trade deficit . Worse , they foresaw a new and frightening threat : the possibility of a financial crisis from which some savings and loan associations might have to be rescued by the Federal Government . <P> The background is this : in addition to investing huge sums in new plants and equipment , U.S. corporations have gone on a speculative inventory binge , buying up metals and raw materials before prices go still higher . They are applying for bank loans at an astonishingly rapid pace ; between February and May , bank loans to business expanded at an annual rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rightly viewing the borrowing surge as inflationary , has deliberately refused to pump enough money into the banking system to accommodate the loan demand . <P> Despite the financial troubles of New York 's Franklin National Bank ( see following story ) , commercial banks are in no real danger . They have raised their prime rate on business loans as high as 11% , and they are paying between 11% and 11 ? % on large-volume certificates of deposit ( CDs ) in order to attract funds . But the situation is different at " thrift institutions " - savings and loans and savings banks , which make mostly mortgage loans . Their income is held down by loans made years ago at relatively low interest , so they can not pay anywhere near as much to attract deposits as commercial banks can . <P> Savings Outflow . In consequence , says Economist Alan Greenspan , " we are in for a massive hemorrhaging of funds from the thrift institutions , " as depositors shift their money into higher-yielding investments . This process is known as " disintermediation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The U.S. Savings and Loan League estimates that in April S and Ls suffered a savings outflow of $350 million , v. a net inflow of $831 million in April 1973 . Ultimately , the process could bring home construction to a virtual standstill by drying up mortgage money , and could threaten the solvency of the thrift institutions themselves . <P> Though no one really expects them to go under , Greenspan fears that the Federal Reserve , working through the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , may have to step in " to prevent actual bankruptcies " by bailing out shaky S and Ls . To Otto Eckstein , the lesson of the danger is that " it is impossible for the U.S. , with its present economic system , to live with double-digit inflation . "
