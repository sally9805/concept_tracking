 | Striking It Rich at Snowbird They are proliferating now at almost the same frenetic pace that once : roduced fast-food eateries and allght laundromats . Find a hill with a pendable blanket of snow ( or maybe winter 's worth of icy boiler plate ) d a passable road nearby , and you 11 find men willing to sink their mon. their teeth and their dreams into it . ney will erect stanchions on the steeps , string up lift lines , hang seats , park cars , - stall a ski school bell , a row of flush : . inlets , a supply of radar-baked cheeseburgers , a cash register and ? lo ! ? the world is presented with still another fabulous new ski resort . It has come to seem almost like Richard Brautigan 's The Cleveland Wrecking Yard , where complete surplus environ -- ments were scrapped and put up for cheap sale and fast assembly : .. The waterfalls all had price tags n them . They were more expensive than e stream . The waterfalls were selling or $19.00 a foot . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Oh , I had never in my life seen anything like that trout stream . It was stacked in piles of various lengths : ten , fifteen , twenty feet , etc . There was one pile of hundredfoot lengths . There was also a box of scraps . . . odd sizes ranging from six inches to a couple of feet .... " Well , perhaps it has not come to that yet . The hills , trails and frills of American ski resorts do not come precut or precast in hundred-foot lengths . Nor do they come cheap . Nor do they come easy . But they are coming very quickly . The past couple of years and this new season of ' 72 have seen a whole grand coast-to-coast wrecking yard full of American resorts launched , each with its own high hopes ? and high promise of being , somehow , something special . And how does one choose ? @# @# High in the Rockies of Colorado are the burgeoning $6 million Keystone Mountain , owned by the Ralston Purina folks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles south of the peak ; lovely unfinished Telluride , also an oldtime mining settlement ; and big , ambitious , $12 million Copper Mountain ? which opens this year with no less than 25 trails and a three-story glass restaurant with a 60-mile view . North of Denver is cute little Sharktooth with one slope , one wire-rope tow , one warming hut and all of its runs under floodlights at night . Or there is Maine , with struggling Evergreen Valley , once dreamed of as a $40 million wonderland but now merely a $4.5 million area with three lifts and legal troubles . And there is Burnt Meadows Mountain , two tow lifts and three trails spread daintily over acreage that was turned to ashes and stumps in a 1947 forest fire . In New Hampshire is Onset Ski Area on Crotched Mountain near Bennington , and there on the Oscar Rosebrook Range will be Bretton Woods , a modest little spot for bunnies , which its developers are pitching as a mountain designed with an eye to " broad lateral scope " rather than trying for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spokane is 49 Degrees North , as the new ski resort at Chewelah Mountain is called , with three chair lifts ( the longest 6,900 feet with a vertical drop of 1,850 ) and over near Harrisonburg , Va. , suh , is Massanutten , four chair lifts in the mild old Shenandoah Valley hills ( maximum drop 795 feet ) , a mere two hours from Washington , D.C. Up in New Jersey is the Playboy Club 's Great Gorge area ( a B-cup mountain if there ever was one ) and there in Pennsylvania is tough little Jack Frost Mountain , a hardy hill that joins with the Poconos ' venerable and respected Big Boulder area , now a quarter of a century old . And in California , where Mineral King still has all of its Disneysized ideas beached in the courts and Squaw Valley has been nipped by the black frost of bankruptcy , there are still brave new resorts in bloom . Notably , there is Northstar-at-Tahoe , which plans a $100 million showplace eventually but opens this year with a lot less ( 10 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which figures on a $60 million facility someday but opens now with six condominiums , a day lodge , 14 trails and four chair lifts . The ski resort boom is deafening and it is possible ? though not probable ? that it has yet to reach a fortissimo . There could be much more to come , but there are those who say that the bull market in ski resorts is already fading . It is true that there is a sharply diminished supply of accessible mountain land for ski trails and facilities . It also is true that the Federal Government , which has leasing rights to a huge majority of America 's mountain lands , is becoming more and more reluctant to allow lovely wild areas to be used for further commercial development and private profit . Then , too , there is an ever more dedicated ? and rapidly growing ? legion of devout conservationists and ecology evangelists who believe more ski areas are a desecration of the wilderness . They are not entirely wrong ; certainly the U.S. is nearing the point where the life expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove are issues more critical than the installation of still another hundred miles of ski trails . This is particularly true considering the inevitable bulldozer destruction and mountain upheaval that come with the arrival of the roads , heavy traffic , sewage lines , parking lots and all-round environment-busting stuff required by a respectable profit-making ski resort . Still , the new plethora of mountains polished and hillsides groomed for skiing has produced at least a few admirable specimens of really tasteful architecture and genuine concern for natureblended planning . None , so far , quite matches the resort that has happened ? and is still happening ? in lovely , winding Little Cottonwood Canyon in the 65  | Wasatch Mountain range 25 miles above Salt Lake City , Utah . The place is called Snowbird . It is named for a little , unheralded silver-mining claim ( which proved to be silverless ) , one of hundreds of such claims that cut a vast patchwork of hopes and scars across the mountainsides 100 years ago . In summer one still can see an occasional rusted one-track , one-man rail line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface there is still a honeycomb of mine shafts and tunnels where men once burrowed for riches . Some found it : in all , about $37 million worth of ore was packed and chipped and tunneled out of the sides of Little Cottonwood Canyon . But the rush turned into a trickle , leaving nothing but a wretched little mining settlement called Alta at the top of the canyon . In summer a gentle carpet of pines and wild flowers spread over the mining scars , and in winter massive falls of snow covered all the tracks of men . The snow was treacherous stuff that often exploded into avalanches , rampaging down the steep slopes , wrenching loose mammoth trees , rolling them like pool cues down the mountainside and turning them into splinters . Nature pretty much ruled the canyon as it wished for several decades ? until 1937 , when the science of avalanche control matured and that decrepit little ghost town of Alta sputtered toward resurrection as a ski area . In those young years of the sport there were perhaps 50,000 U.S. skiers ( compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mecca for deep-powder addicts , known around the world as that rare vastness of untouched slopes where purists and experts only need apply . After all , the mountainsides fell away at a degree just something less than vertical , and the only thing that kept the skiers connected to the world was the fact that they were literally up to their armpits in fluffy snow . But Alta never grew very much , being in the remote and liquorless state of Utah , and came to rely almost entirely for revenue on local folks ? who are a notoriously spoiled and stingy breed , since they need drive but 30 minutes to the greatest snow on earth and pay no more than $7 for a weekend lift ticket . Even now , in its 35th year , the place seems relentless in its determination to remain modest : Alta still has only four small lodges and six chair lifts , and can handle no more than 4,200 skiers per hour . But by anybody 's definition , unassuming , shambling old Alta is the true godfather to the brawny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had there been no Alta , Snowbird 's golden egg would certainly never have hatched . Among the purists who succumbed to the glories of Alta powder long ago was a strapping , blue-eyed chap named George Theodore Johnson , carefree and possessed of energetic joie de vivre , a onetime cotton-picker , bicycle rider , lifeguard-bar manager at Waikiki and a new convert to skiing . In 1954 , then 28 , Ted Johnson was on his way to Sun Valley for an aimless winter when someone told him about Alta . Although he went around the world a couple of times later , performing in ski-adventure films , Ted Johnson never really left Utah again . He moved in as a handyman and later became famous as the caretaker at a tiny mid-station shelter high on the mountainside , selling magnificent hamburgers to cold , hungry skiers and gaining a reputation as a cook that almost matched his status as the best powder skier in the West . Johnson also managed the Alta and Rustler Lodges . His own sense of resort image was not so sharply honed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak of the Kennedy years in Washington , D.C. , he flat-out refused a request by Robert F. Kennedy and family for rooms at the Alta Lodge . " Well , it was Christmas and we were filled up , " he shrugs now . " No one at Alta ever thought of what it would mean in prestige and business to have a President 's family there . That was n't the Alta way . " But even as Alta settled deeper into its innocent old ways , Johnson had his eye on something better just down the canyon . For years the hardiest skiers from Alta had been hiking up over the range to the high powder fields in the areas called Peruvian Gulch and Gad Valley . On top , at 11,000 feet , they could look down into the Salt Lake Valley on one side and , on the other , down on the top of Alta . From this lofty jumpoff , they would curl down those unmarked drops , billowing clouds of dry powder all around , spinning past great white pine groves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was 66 no better skiing in the world than tha says Johnson , and he began to dre of putting the slopes to use for m than the few mavericks willing to over from Alta . In 1965 Johnson scratched toget enough capital , about $30,000 , to buy sprawling old mining claim called Bla. jack , which lay between Alta and t dream mountainside . Then he set to w in the dusty files and record books county land offices , burrowing throw thousands of yellowed pages to find t forgotten ownership of some 95 of abandoned mining claims . One by o he sifted and sorted through them , fin ' ly sewing up all the land he needed . H paid $18,500 for the last parcel to a griz zled ex-miner he had at last located li ing in a retirement house trailer in Fontana , Calif . That is the way ski resorts are born . Johnson had wrapped up 857 acres of ' land , most of it backing right up against 1,200 acres of Wasatch National Forest ? with projected expansion possibilities stretching into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , tough chore of raising enough money ? $5 million might be a nice round sum , he figured ? to install the lifts , put in a tram , the lodging , restaurants , parking lots and poi ' etlines to make his fanciful dream Snowbird take off . Johnson came up with a movie ( starring the inimitable Ted Johnson floating down the powder slope ) showing the snowy realities of the place , added scale models of the ambitious and decorous village he envisioned at the base of the hills ? and set out on an exhausting expedition through the executive suites and corporate boardrooms of the land . His wife Wilma , a tall , strikingly handsome Australian lady who is considered a pow - der skier second only to Ted himself . went along . " We hustled every big corporation in the country , " says Ted . " We 'd make our presentation and they 'd be really interested in it . A ski resort ? It excited a lot of them . I went to Boise Cascade . Royal Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell them I was sure it would take 10 years before the thing could turn around and make a profit ? but that it looked like a sure thing . Well , lots of them loved the dream ? lots of the people I talked to loved the dream , that is . But then they 'd continued  | @# say , ' Well , maybe we 'd better run it through the computer and see what it says . ' " The old Snowbird got defeathered by more computers than any project in history , I guess . " The computer rejections went on and on , for about five years . Johnson tried everything else , even selling the place piecemeal like a private club , until one night he was at a cocktail party in Vail , Colo. , staring despairingly into his drink , when up stepped a chap with a thick Texas drawl . " I 've heard your name , " the stranger . aid . " Where are you from ? " " Alta , " said Johnson . " I been dyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said . And then he said : " Tell me , are there any investments available over there ? " The stranger was Richard D. Bass , 42 , native of Dallas and graduate of Yale , one of the heirs to one of the robust oil and ranching fortunes in America . Already a large and influential investor in the Aspen Ski Corp . and Vail Associates , Bass flew to Utah to look at Ted Johnson 's dream resort . The two of them donned boots and climbed the mountain , hiking every lift line and major trail that Johnson had planned . And Investor Bass signed on , calling himself general partner and underwriting everything . Ted Johnson 's days of balky computers and ephemeral dreams faded for good . The Bird , as they say along Little Cottonwood Canyon , started to take off . It was n't an easy launching . There ere no ready-made scrap parts for a ski resort lying around to be bought for $l9 a foot . In fact , what started out as a $5 million investment rose to $8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally shot to $13.5 million before the opening season of 1971-72 . But the money was well planted into the landscape . Now there are more than 30 miles of ski runs in Peruvian Gulch and Gad Valley , which undulate downward in gigantic fluffy snow steps . A monster Swiss aerial tram carries 120 passengers from the base plaza at 8,100 feet to the 11,000-foot Ridden Peak in six minutes . Another four double chair lifts can move 4,800 skiers per hour . From the top , there are 36 north-facing runs , many of them 2 ? miles long with roughly a 3,100-foot vertical drop . And Snowbird is not only big , but steep : 22 of the runs are for experts . Intermediate skiers get nine and novices five , the sort of setup that makes one aspire to improve . Snowbird gets its dry powder from early November to late May ? an average fall of 450.5 inches per season ? and since much of it falls overnight , skiers are usually greeted by an entire morning mountainside of untouched , unbroken snow . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem : from the beginning Johnson was met with fierce and stubborn resistance by all sorts of local folk . The Wasatch Mountain Club , a band of militant conservationists , attacked Snowbird as being no more than another profiteer 's rape of the wilderness , insisting that the huge increase in auto traffic to the resort would upset the ecology of the canyon , that the buildings ( one of them a proposed 19-story condominium ) would wreck the canyon esthetics , that the bulldozer destruction would rip up the natural habitat of countless species of wildlife . Nearly every public hearing on Snowbird facilities turned into bitter shouting matches . One by one , Ted Johnson debated and rebutted and argued with those who opposed him . Now , at 46 , his hair has turned pure white and there are deep purple circles beneath his eyes . He rarely skis anymore , but he has begun to convince people that perhaps Snowbird is neither rapist nor blatant profiteer . " Sure , the traffic rate is up in the canyon , " he said , " but lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with Snowbird . We 're working on the idea of a monorail or a bus service up from the bottom to keep cars at a minimum . All our buildings are designed to blend with the mountains . We 're even planting grass on the roofs so from on top they wo n't conflict with the natural environment . I 've insisted every tree must be preserved . Actually , it has cost us quite a few thousand extra bucks to do it , too , but I will not have this mountain all cut up for Snowbird . We went for high-rise buildings because we did n't want to create a sprawling clutter at the base of the slope . We did n't want a layer of one-story buildings stretching all over the bottom slopes like some kind of Levittown . We 're keeping everything compact , unified . People are starting to believe us , but do n't kid yourself ? 1 'm going to have to fight and argue and bitch for every new building we put up . Hell . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building we put up . " Economically , the first season was , predictably , awful ? losses averaged $$20,000 a week . Dick Bass has now had to dig for at least another million out of his own pocket . And now Snowbird must keep expanding , adding new condominiums , new rooms in order to attract enough skiers to produce enough revenue to ? someday , some year ? get out of the red . Economic success is a long way off , though Snowbird expects to start breaking even this winter . But already Snowbird is a spectacular esthetic success . The architecture is a delicate , yet rugged , combination of wood and concrete , gracefully combined in the Lodge in an attractive sweeping array of balconies and railings facing the ski slopes . The Lodge ( 350 beds in 160 rooms and apartments ) is joined to the " Village , " a remarkably tasteful single structure including the administrative offices , ski shops , two restaurants , a cafeteria , a pharmacy , discotheque , the ski school and lift-ticket sales booth , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departures of the tram . It is a miracle of planning and unity that neatly avoids the sprawl and foolishness ? to say nothing of the snarled car traffic ? that ruin so many ski villages . Apartments are being built steadily , a new 70-unit condominium opening next month . Ted Johnson and Dick Bass have laid out a series of future expansions over the mountain , eventually , perhaps , even spilling over into some of the incredible powder bowls on the other side of the Snowbird slopes . But what of the skiing now , today ? There is simply none better . The terrain of Peruvian Gulch and Gad Valley is exquisitely hair-raising ? steep and straight as church steeples in some places , a snowball of moguls in others . Except for the lilting undulations of Big Emma ( named after a grand madam of Alta 's mining days ) , there is not so much for the timid intermediate to enjoy . Yet it is hard to think of a more beautiful , more exciting , more skiable mountain than that which looms over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cottonwood Canyon may well prove to be , as an awed visiting Frenchman exclaimed recently , " the Louvre of the world 's ski resorts !
