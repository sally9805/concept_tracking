 | " Are you going to the convention today ? " she asked . " I do n't particularly want to , " I said , " except that I would like to join you at lunch . " " Well , you ca n't . I 'm going to be with my publisher , and I do n't want anyone absently stroking my fanny at the table . It does n't go with my image . " " It goes with my image . " " Then stroke your publisher 's fanny and impress him . You leave my rear end alone in public . " " All right , but I wo n't go with you on those terms . Hands that do n't touch fannies shall never be mine . Except that ? " For the first time since I had hugged Shirley the evening before , something stirred within me . That is , something that was n't hooked up to an endocrine gland . I did n't know what it was ; not the faintest idea . I just had a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except that maybe I ought to go in and cheer for poor Giles at his autographing session . " Funny . I could even mention Giles and remember yelling at him and being shamefaced about it now that I was feeling fulfilled and calm , and yet not think of the errand I had failed to run  --  at least , not consciously . I went over to the end table near the bed to look at my watch . " I can do it , " I said . " I can guzzle down my coffee , take a quick shower , and not be more than a few minutes late , and then I 'll see you after lunch , and I get the first chance at instant replay . " I could have done it , too . I think it was my last chance . If I had gotten there and if Giles had seen me , I would have remembered what I had forgotten because he would have left the platform and charged me even with a thousand people waiting for a signature . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in it . It was just my vague unanalyzed anxiety pushing me , and I probably would n't have gone  --  well , maybe I would n't  --  even if Shirley had n't put in an objection .  | She said , " Oh , going to one of those autographing sessions is cre-e-epy . They just line up . You 've autographed books . " Not as often as all that . There were two times when I signed books after a book-and-author luncheon , and three or four times after I had given a talk on those few occasions when Prism Press had supplied books the day before I gave the talk instead of the day after . ( Other publishing houses are as bad , even the best of them . ) Autographing books is nice in a way . Every book is a sale , and every sale is six bits or more in your private till ( before taxes , of course ) . On the other hand , there 's the strain of it . The same thing . The same thing . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smile . Thank you . Thank you . I 'm so glad you like my books . I 'm so glad . Thank you . The pleasure 's mine . Thank you . When it 's done , you go out and bite the nearest bystander to get the sickly-sweet goo out of your mouth . Some are better at it than others . I know one author who will sign nothing but hardbacks , and then only his name in a wavy scrawl that means nothing . Asimov goes to the other extreme , the incredible ham . He 's the only writer I know who actually enjoys it . I watched him at a signing session once , and there are no limits to the lengths he will go . He scrawls out " with love " and " with passion " and " with ravished ecstasy " at random , asking only that the person before him be at least vaguely feminine . Once he asked a young woman 's first name and then wrote : " To Sheila , in memory of that night on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went all the way . " He 'd never seen her before , of course , but she went off giggling and clutching the precious souvenir to her ample breasts  --  and probably lied about it later . And he 'll sign anything , hardbacks , softbacks , other people 's books , scraps of paper . Inevitably someone handed him a blank check on the occasion when I was there , and he signed that without as much as a waver to his smile  --  except that he signed : " Harlan Ellison . " " Who 's Harlan Ellison ? " I asked afterward.  | " Friend of mine , " he said . Then he added irrelevantly , " About your height . " * I thought of all that in connection with autographing , yawned , and said , " Guess you 're right . " Goodbye , last chance . " But I 'll still go , " I said . It was the uneasiness talking , but it seemed to make more sense to blame it on my passion for Shirley . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe I 'll go to the lunch , find you , sneak over to you when you 're not expecting it , and stroke your fanny , and yell , Lookit , everybody ! Lookit , everybody ! ' " " You do that , and I 'll tell everyone you 're impotent . " " I 'll say only with you . " " I 'll say you never tried anyone else . " " I 'll say that 's because you believe everything I tell you . " " I 'll say ? " It was a game of ours . First one who could n't get past the " I 'll say ? " got a punch on the shoulder , which usually developed into all sorts of other things . In this case it was Shirley who failed , so I kissed her shoulder and she said , " No-o-o-o , you idiot , I 've got to get ready . " So I took a quick shower , dressed and went back home to change underwear and shirt , shave , and make myself look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the hotel on that beautiful spring morning of Memorial Day . My conscience was still clear . 2 MARY ANN LIPSKY 10:45 A.M. I got to the hotel at about ten forty-five . Giles Devore and Isaac Asimov were scheduled to keep on signing books till eleven , so  | they were still at it , but that did n't bother me any . I was n't going to catch the last few minutes . I found out afterward what the autographing arrangements were . A big room was used and it was the only room that might officially be used at the convention for the autographing of books , though lesser objects such as book announcements could be signed at the booths . At one end of the room was a stage at which both signers sat , and the line moved up to the first signer , then to the second signer , with each person guaranteed two free books . I do n't suppose any of the twelve thousand people who attended the convention walked off without something free . If not a signed book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device . There was n't a booth that did n't have someone pushing something on somebody . Some booths were giving out shopping bags into which you could put the stuff that the other booths were emitting . I made my way to the Prism Press booth , but neither Tom nor Teresa was there . I recognized the bored young lady who was in charge as Mary Ann Lipsky , who was Teresa 's secretary . Apparently they were making at least one underling work on Memorial Day . Mary Ann was a pleasant girl , not very pretty , with a complexion that tended to the mottle and a voice that tended to the lisp , but pretty is as pretty does sometimes , and I could always count on her to be helpful when I was having some sort of hassle with the Valiers . It is always good to have a spy in the enemy camp . So I said , " And how is my lovely princess of Prism . " She cheered up at once and said , " Hello , Mr. just " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . " Not very much . " I said , " Where is the Tsar and the Tsarina ? " She said , " The Tsarina is with Mr. Devore at the autographing . " " Oh yes , she said she would be . " " And the Tsar is off in conference somewhere . " " And you do n't know when they 'll be back ? " " The Tsarina might be back after the autographing , but I do n't think so , and I do n't know about the Tsar at all . "  | " Oh well , I wo n't wait , unless you and I  --  underneath the chair ? " " Everyone will see us , Mr. Just . " " That 's the best part , " I said gravely . She laughed , and I felt good at having spread the cheer about . I said , " May I leave a note for them ? " " Sure , " she said . I scrawled : " Tried to talk to Giles , but absolutely no go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann , who put it half under a book . She smiled at me affectionately and then turned to talk , with animation , to someone inquiring about someone . I bet myself a resigned nine to five that the Valiers would decide either that I had n't talked to Giles at all or that I had yelled at him ( as they would undoubtedly hear ) and had ruined everything just as he was about to become compliance itself . Well , I was armored in truth and in the memory of a successful night , so I did n't give a damn . I asked after Roseann at a few logical places , but could n't find her or , for that matter , anyone I knew . Then I wandered past a booth where a cookbook was being pushed and where slivers of cake were being handed out in consequence . I kept passing and repassing and had five slivers , each with a kind of vanilla icing that was n't bad . I like sweet things ; cake , too . I went on a deliberate scouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of comestibles and had a free cola drink . It was a pity I had made up my mind to attend the lunch and listen to Douglas of Hentsau , Jr. , because I could have made a great meal on the freebies without ever insulting my uninsultable digestion . 3 MARTIN WALTERS 12:10 P.M. It was somewhat after noon when I wandered up to the banquet room and found the doors closed and a sign that said it would open at twelve-thirty . That was when it was scheduled to begin , so I do n't know why I was surprised . Every ten seconds a party of two or three tried moving in , promptly got shooed out by some waiter , and walked out looking annoyed and embarrassed .  | A young man of about twenty-two ( I should judge ) standing near me and , I suppose , impressed by my distantly superior attitude , as though I knew far too much to try to get into a door I could n't get into , asked if I were a writer . I confessed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius Just , " I said . He looked uncertain and I knew what was going on behind his face . He was wondering what he could say that would be polite and would not give away the fact that he had n't the foggiest notion of who I was and what I wrote . I sighed inaudibly . It was Martin Walters who rescued me and for that I forgave him , finally , for the day before . He called , " Darius ! " and motioned strenuously for me to join him . I did so , and he said , " What are you doing standing there in the ranks with the privates ? Come join us officers at the cocktail party . " " What cocktail party ? " " This cocktail party . " I had followed him to a small room just off the banquet hall and there it was  --  and Martin had a drink before I could draw two breaths . About a hundred people were talking to each other in clumps , the biggest group maintaining itself at a respectful distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if Shirley were there , and when I saw she was n't , I knew she could be nowhere in the room . She 'd probably arrive too late to do anything but get into the luncheon and I decided I had better not tell her that she missed a chance to touch her hero or she 'd be too miserable later to touch me . Anita Loos of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Cathleen Nesbit , who played dowager duchesses in at least fifty movies , were there , too ; both small and aged and looking happy . Asimov was there , being introduced . He held out his hand to Anita Loos with a fatuous smile and said , " I 've always wanted to play cards with you and Howard Fast , Miss Loos , for then I 'd be playing Fast and Loos . "  | She looked at him in puzzlement and I stepped away quickly . I did n't want to be introduced after that since I despaired of being able to top that remark for sheer imbecility. * Then it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there also . At least he ought to have been finished autographing over an hour ago . I looked about again , and Martin Walters , remembering my question of the evening before , I suppose ( the only other alternative is telepathy ) , put his head on one side , focused his glance on me through his pince-nez , and said , " Looking for Devore again ? " " I thought he might be around , " I said . " I do n't think so . He 's probably off somewhere sulking . That man is not a professional . He proved it again this morning . " " What did he do , Martin ? " " He made some kind of fuss during the autographing session . I do n't know what it was . I was in the room talking to the Hercules Books people and all I know was that the autographing was stopped cold . Nellie ? Do you know Nellie Griswold of Her-cules ? " I thought a moment . " Maybe by sight . The name does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sight , you 're well off . Tall and very ? " His hands waved appropriate curves in the air , which was easier to do now that he had reduced his drink to its icy skeleton . Then he looked about to see if anyone had seen him make those terribly obscene gestures . " Do n't get me wrong , " he said . " She 's a nice girl . " " I believe you . I know lots of shapely girls who manage to be nice , too . But what did she do ? " " Oh , you mean about that nut , Devore . She had to run and  | bring him something . It was awful . It just put a damper on the show . The damn fool had better not sign at all than put on a display like that . He did n't seem to have been drinking , but something was wrong with him . " I made a routine deprecating noise . I must admit I was n't terribly surprised , or even interested . Devore was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the worse for those who had to deal with him , among whom would never again be me ( I silently swore ) . Martin put down his empty glass on a convenient table and said , " I understand you chewed him out last night , Darius . I was glad to hear it . Do you suppose that had something to do with his being upset today ? " If he wanted some retailable gossip , he was n't going to have it . " Not a thing , " I said quickly . " We 're on perfectly good terms . " It is unbelievable to me , as I look back on it now , that I could listen to Martin 's reference to a fearfully upset Giles , talk to him briefly concerning the night before , and still not have anything register . By then , of course , it was some forty-five to fifty minutes too late . 4 HAROLD SAYERS 12:40 P.M. It was somewhat past twelve-thirty when we were all shooed into the next room to the tables reserved for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant-looking gray-haired man who was one of the minor officials of the ABA . He introduced himself as Harold Sayers and told me that he owned a bookstore in Bangor , Maine . Next to him was his wife , Rosalind . I grinned , named myself , shook hands all round the table , and turned my attention to the lunch . The inevitable fruit cup and mixed salad were already on the table , together with the one roll and one pat of butter . After a while , the roast chicken was brought in , together with carrots and little roast potatoes . As is my wont on such occasions , I skipped the carrots and asked for a double on the little roast potatoes . I said , " No carrots , two potatoes , " and when I got exactly two  | potatoes , I said before the waiter could escape , " I mean a double helping of potatoes . " He served me the double helping and looked disapproving , which disturbed me not at all . It 's fashionable to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you must please a thousand people with one dish for all ? Serve something unusual and two thirds of those present wo n't eat it . Chicken and roast beef will be eaten by everyone ( barring the small but growing number of vegetarians ) , so that 's it . Fortunately , I like chicken and roast beef , and I also like potatoes cooked in any style ever invented , so I ca n't go wrong at banquets . I looked about vaguely once or twice for Shirley , but there was really no chance of seeing her unless she had been at some immediately neighboring table , which she was n't . It did n't matter . I 'd see her immediately after lunch at the booth where she would be autographing  --  I was quite confident of that , which shows how little we know . I was feeling quite good . I was looking forward to seeing Shirley again , I expected to enjoy listening to Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , and I was laughing it up with Mr. Sayers of the ABA , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I did some joke swapping . He asked me why Poles do n't become pharmacists and I said , " Why ? " and he said , " They ca n't get those little bottles into the typewriters . " Then I asked him why Poles specialized in sausages and the Arabs in oil , and he said , " Why ? " and I said , " The Poles had first choice . " Mrs. Sayers looked puzzled both times . Personally , Polish jokes make me very fond of Poles . The fact that you never hear of anyone telling a Polish joke and getting beat up by some justly incensed Poles shows them to be a sweet natured , decent , and secure people . One joke he told was of the long and involved type and it went like this : " Mrs. Alexander Chumley-Smythe of London called her husband in the City and said , My dear , there is a fearful brute of a  | gorilla in the beech tree in the garden , mopping and mowing and making a spectacle of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , old dear , ' said Chumley-Smythe , and I will be right home . ' " So he was , and , having observed the gorilla , he walked into the house and said , Not to worry , my dear , we shall simply get in touch with some sound gorilla-trapping organization . ' " Turning to the London yellow pages , he looked under the heading of Gorilla Trapping ' and dialed the firm of Fortescue and Brown . There was an immediate answer : Fortescue here . ' " Chumley-Smythe told his story and Fortescue said , yes , I will be right there . Hold tight and do not let the brute escape . ' " He was there within half an hour , bringing with him a ladder , an enormous dog , a rifle , and a large pair of manacles . He said , My partner , Brown , is on vacation and I wonder if you can help me . ' " Certainly , ' said Chumley-Smythe . What do you wish me to do ? ' " I shall climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then vigorously shake the branch on which the gorilla is sitting . This will shake him off and as soon as he hits the ground this ferocious gorilla hound will instantly seize the beast by his testicles . With the brute pinned in this fashion , you have only to place these large manacles upon his wrists and when I come down from the tree , we will be all set . ' " That seems simple enough , ' said Chumley-Smythe , but for what purpose have you brought this rifle ? ' " Fortescue slapped his forehead in disgust and said , Dear , dear , I 'll be forgetting my head next . Why , the rifle is the most important part . While I am shaking the branch , you stand there with the rifle and if , by some mischance , it should be I that fall out of the tree , then without waiting a moment , shoot the dog . ' The table broke up over that one , and I laughed , too . In fact , I laughed loud and long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that fact , for it was the last time I felt carefree at that convention .  | 5 SARAH VOSKOVEK 1:05 P.M. I was just finishing my chicken , gnawing the last of the bones , when I saw a woman making her way among the tables in our general direction . The room was fairly dim , except for the lights over the head table ( perhaps on the general theory that banquet food looks better in a dim light ) , and she was just a blur to me . However , there was her height and the fact that her hair was piled high on her head , so I knew it was what's-her-name  --  I could n't even recall the first name now  --  who had been so snotty the night before . But it was the afternoon following . I had had a good night and a reasonable morning ; I was enjoying lunch and had had a good laugh . All in all , I was in no mood to waste further resentment on her . She could go her way , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so with no thought in my mind as to the advisability of her breaking a leg in the process . Since the attendance was good and the tables rather closer together than was quite comfortable , the woman 's progress was slow . She was heading toward the front of the room , and studying the tables anxiously . I was on the point of making a small mental bet as to which table she would end up at , when all bets were off , and it became quite clear she was heading in the direction of our table . Until , eventually , she stopped in front of me , and it seemed to me that if I was startled , she was a little confused . The light was n't quite good enough for me to tell for sure . She caught me unawares and I did n't stand up . I had the rather vague notion that she had come to renew her attack of the evening before and my face froze into a glower as I tried to steel myself for a class-A scene . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more softly . She said , in her beautifully precise English , with that sprinkle of Slavic accent , " Mr. Just , I am so glad I have found you . I 'm Sarah Voskovek . We met last night . " " I remember our meeting . I remember your name , " I said aus-  | terely , four words out of eight being truthful . Then I added , " I did n't know you knew my name . " " I did n't know your name last night , I 'm afraid . But , of course , I know you . I have read your books . I particularly like Beware the Evening Star . " She was talking in a low , hurried voice , as though she felt an urgent need for privacy , and I had spoken in a normal voice , as though I were in no mood to oblige her . But under the worst of conditions , a writer has to melt just a little bit under the warm sun of praise for his book . So I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table and into the open space between ourselves and the head table . I even lowered my own voice as I said , " Did you see the picture they made out of the book ? It was called Come the Evening . " " Yes , I did . I hope you do n't mind , but it was a poor interpretation of the book . It fell far short . " I did n't mind at all , since that was exactly how I felt . I melted a bit more at this evidence of good judgment . We were n't far from the wall , and I drifted in that direction . She moved with me , still looking anxious . I said , " Now that you know who I am , do you wish to rephrase anything you said last night ? " I was a little stiff about it but repressed the impulse to add " dearie " or " toots " at the end of the question . " More than rephrase , Mr. Just . I want to erase it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike out at you like that . " " Because I 'm Darius Just , author of Beware the Evening Star ? " I was n't making it easy for her , and she took a deep breath . I could n't help but notice the interesting things that did to her cleavage . She was wearing a low-cut gown again and this time I was standing up . I found it rather pleasant to be able to look down at a pair of breasts . There was an easy comfort about it . " Well , " I said , urging her on a bit roughly . She held her temper and said , " No , Mr. Just . That 's not it . You were right to tell me that attempts at prior restraint were out of order . I was officious and unpleasant . I have already apologized to Dr. Asimov shortly before his autographing session and he assured  | me that he never had any intention of naming the hotel or identifying it in any way . It was only after that that I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he told me you were Darius Just , well ? " By now I was melted into a mush and had decided she was n't such a bad little kid if you like them squashed down . " Forget it , " I said , " I think I would like to modify some of the things I said last night . " " Such as telling me that I ought to indulge in my public relations ? Did that have an improper meaning ? " I felt myself flushing . " I did n't mean it that way , " I lied , " but it could sound as if it was improper . I 'm sorry . " " No offense taken , " she said gravely . It was quite a love feast and I was actually wondering , in a detached sort of way , if I ought to put my arm around her waist as a gesture of friendship , when she said , " But that 's not the only reason I have come to seek you out , Mr. Just . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , grinning , " call me Darius , because I 've got to call you Sarah . I ca n't pronounce your last name . " " Voskovek , " she said , pronouncing it distinctly . The accent was on the second syllable , which had a long " o , " like this : " VosKOH-vek . " " Still , you can call me Sarah . " She had a dimple on the left side when she smiled ; not on the right . " Okay , then . What 's the other thing you wanted to talk about ? " " It 's Mr. Giles Devore . Is he a friend of yours ? " " In a way , " I said dryly . And then I said , " Why ? Why do you ask ? " " There was a queer incident at the autographing session this morning . I had decided to come to the session since I knew Dr. Asimov would be there and I did wish to make up for last night . I lingered on for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a rumpus . Mr. Devore was very unhappy . It disturbed me , for it 's rather important to the hotel that there be nothing that would make unnecessarily unpleasant headlines ? " " I understand , " I said .  | " It was over , however . He had been brought something and he had settled down . Later , though , I heard him mutter , That Darius ! That Darius Just ! ' And he said it with such hate . I had to find you  --  I hoped you would be at the luncheon , for I did n't know how to locate you otherwise  --  so that I could both apologize to you and warn you as well . Mr. Devore is a large man and you are  --  not large  --  and ? " I said contemptuously , " He 's as soft as a pin cushion , Sarah , without the pins . Do n't give it a single thought . With one hand , open-palm , I could slap him silly and make him thank me for the favor . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor " in this connection that did it . At any rate , at just about 1:15 P.M. on Monday , May 26 , 1975 , I remembered , all at once , and in one big piece , exactly what I had forgotten some eighteen hours before . " Oh , my God , " I said , half strangling . " Oh , my God . " I slapped hard at my jacket pockets in an agony of embarrassment . I had changed shirt , socks , and underwear that morning , but I had the same pants and jacket I had worn the night before . The room key was in my jacket pocket ; I could feel it . The ticket had to be there , too . I said , in a gasping sort of way . " Pardon me . Got to do something . " She said , in a frightened voice , " But what is it ? " Harold Sayers , my companion at the table , must have been watching me from a distance of some twenty feet . He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . I had even attracted the attention of the head table , but I did n't care . I did n't even care that an ice-cream parfait was being served as dessert and that I might miss it  --  to say nothing of coffee . I was off at a run , fumbling for the ticket . 6 HILDA 1:20 P.M. What the devil was I so panicked about ? Done or not done , the matter could n't possibly be important except in Giles 's own nit-picking mind . I knew that at the start . I  | knew that as I trotted down an escalator moving too slowly for me , ducking past people who were irritated at being shoved and who showed it . Forgetting is human . What could he do to me ? Besides , he would have come back last night , seen that the stuff was n't on the bureau , and gone down to the checkroom . He would have demanded it , ticket or not , and gotten the manager or the nearest official available at that time of night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package or to make the entire hotel aware of the problem . Since nobody seemed aware anything had happened late last night , he had his package and the checkroom did n't . He had been muttering against me to Sarah because some small inconvenience at the autographing table had put him in mind of a series of inconveniences that had been plaguing him , and I was included . ( Had n't I gone through the same sort of thing yesterday ? ) The trouble was , I did n't believe it . I ran across the hall to the checkroom indicated on the ticket . How could I help it when in common with a hundred million others I had been beaten into conditioned reflex by the age of ten . Did you ever forget an errand you had been sent on by your mother ? Did you ever forget to bring your homework to school ? There were physical assaults ( what else do you call a spanking ? ) and writings of " I shall not forget my homework " a hundred times . Endless humiliations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , quite calmly , that the matter was of no importance . My heart thudded , " Golly , I forgot  --  golly , I forgot ? " I was panting fairly noticeably by the time I got to the checkroom counter . There was no one else there at 1:2o P.M. on a warm Memorial Day and this , fortunately , eliminated one ground for delay . I whistled to attract the attention of an elderly woman in a shapeless green dress . She seemed indignant at being hailed in that fashion and walked toward me with the attitude of having been a queen in a past reincarnation  --  in the recent past , at that .  | She had a little nameplate that said she was Hilda , and wore tinted glasses and hair of a somewhat tarnished chemical yellow . I presented the ticket and said , " Is this still here ? " I could n't tell her what I meant by " this " because I did n't know . She looked at the ticket with an expert eye as though there were a trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant knew . She gave it back at last and said , " If you 've got the ticket , it 's still here . " " Would you get it , then ? " " That will be another fifty cents . " " What ? " " That 's a yesterday 's ticket . You paid fifty cents in advance but that was only for yesterday . Fifty cents more for today . " I brought out two quarters . " Here you are . " She walked leisurely to one side of the room while I bet myself a breathless five to two that she 'd come back with the news that it was gone , and I rooted hard for the five . I lost . She showed up in twenty seconds with a package about nine inches long , two inches across , and two inches deep . It weighed perhaps four ounces . I said , " Is that what the ticket 's for ? " She said , " It 's your ticket , mister . " She was very indifferent to it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay fifty cents to check something this size ? I said , " Listen , did someone come down last night to pick up something without having a ticket ? " She said , " How late last night ? If it was after four in the afternoon , I was n't on . " I turned away . She said , " Someone tried this morning . " I turned back . " When this morning ? " " Just before ten , I think . I said he could n't have anything without a ticket and she dragged him away , Little Pepper ; said he was late for something . " I was scarcely listening . He had come to his senses too late and he was being dragged to the autographing by Henrietta as she had  | dragged him to the television taping the night before . I was almost sorry for the silly bastard . I said , " You did n't give it to him , then ? " " Of course I did n't . Not without a ticket . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to check . After all , had it been Giles ? I said , " Big man ? Mustache ? Thick black mustache ? " She nodded her head . " Yes . That 's right . " " Was it this package he wanted " " How do I know what he wanted ? He had no ticket and I do n't listen to anyone without a ticket . " I turned away for the last time and made for the elevators . For some reason Giles had n't noticed last night that I had n't delivered the material . For some reason he had n't done anything about it till so late this morning that it was too late . He 'd been rushed off to the autographing session . No wonder he had been muttering against me . It was fresh in his mind . What room was he in ? I checked the key I had as I approached the elevator banks . It was 1511 , so I got into the correct elevator and pushed the " 15 " button . I had perhaps twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minimize  --  recriminations . Nothing came . I would have to say , " Something came up , Giles , and I did n't have a chance till now . " It was almost true , and what the hell could he do about it ? My mind said : Nothing . My heart said : Write a hundred times : " I shall not forget to deliver packages for a friend . " 7 GILES DEVORE 1:30 P.M. I stood before the door marked 1511 , and since there was no one visible in the corridor either way , and therefore no one before whom I had to put on a meaningless display of courage and resolution , I listened at the door for a few seconds . I might hear him talking to someone and then , of course , he would n't throw any real fit before witnesses ( wishful thinking , perhaps ) and I could be out and away quickly . Or he might be walking about and I  | could tell from the sound of the footsteps whether he was calm or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked , and there was no response ; no sound of footsteps moving toward the door ; no sound of anything , in fact . I knocked again . Nothing . I wasted a few more moments trying to gather the significance of that  --  just to delay a confrontation I did n't want . Maybe he had gone to the luncheon , in which case I could use the key , place the package and the key on the bureau , and swear myself blue that I had left them there the night before . I could tell him that if he had n't seen them , he had either been blind , drunk , or crazy . What could he do to me ? No ! He could n't have gone to the luncheon , for if he had , he would have tracked me down and stood there looming over my seat at the table with a face of doom and a hard-breathed " What did you do with my package , Darius ? " in a kind of controlled rage of self-pity . ( I knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each syllable ringing in my ear . ) That little girl , Sarah Vostovek  --  ah , I remembered her name  --  had found me and so could he . Of course , he could be anywhere else in the hotel , or out of it , for that matter . He might have been reduced to a perfect snit at whatever it was that had annoyed him during the autographing , so that he had flounced up to his room , grabbed his belongings , checked out of the hotel , and gone back to New Jersey . In that case , when I opened the door , I would find nothing in the room but an unmade bed and damp towels in the bathroom . In that case , I would go somewhere where I could write a note and make a package . I would wrap , address , and mail the object I had in my hand and make the note a manly one of contrition , and then I would go down to the exhibition room and watch Shirley sign her name . With luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he would have cooled down to nothing more than snubbing me when we met  --  which snubbing I looked forward to with delight . So I used my key and opened the door , stopped on the thresh-  | old , and found myself astonished . The room was not empty ; it was clearly occupied . There was a shirt draped tipsily over the back of a chair and a pair of pants over the arm , with the pants belt trailing off on the floor . Two socks were on the floor , near but not on two shoes , as though someone had thrown the socks at the shoes and missed . An undershirt and shorts were over the other arm of the chair and now I could see a bit of a tie peeping out from under the shirt . It could n't be Giles 's room , and I looked at the key . But that was silly . The key had opened the door , had n't it ? Could Giles have had two different keys , the non-mate having been given him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong one by mistake ? No , that was ridiculous . The thin briefcase on the bureau was his . I would have recognized it even without the G.D . on it . Beside it was one of his monogrammed throwaway pens . I closed the door behind me , double-locked it , walked into the middle of the room , and stood there uncertain . It was all a real puzzler to me , an incongruity . The room was Giles 's since it had his briefcase , his pen , and therefore presumably his clothes in it . Yet it could n't be his in some ways . The thing to do was to leave the key and package , shrug off the incongruity , and go away . I did put them down on the bureau and then found myself staring at the pen that was lying there . Near it was a thin film of talcum powder with something that looked like finger marks near one end as though someone had tried to brush it away . Automatically and without thinking , I drew my finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted my finger to my nose to see if I had placed any undesirable smell on it . I had n't , at least not since I had gnawed at the chicken bone . Absently , I licked at the finger with its taste of chicken and stiffened at once . Good God ! Impossible ! I sat down in one of the chairs  --  not the one with the clothes draped over it  --  and stared at those clothes , and then at my finger . To my right was the bureau with the pen , the briefcase , the key , and the package on it , and I reached for the pen automatically ,  | even rising from the chair to do so . A writer reaches for a pen to aid the process of thinking as a non-writer might scratch his head ? even if the pen is no more than twiddled . I was careful not to touch the talcum powder , however . I did n't intend to do more than twiddle the pen , but the hotel pad was lying on the bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pen . With both pen and paper in my hand , I had to produce something and I drew a large , firm question mark and then drew short lines radiating from it in every direction . At about the third or fourth mark , the ink gave out . It was a dry pen with just a trace of ink having trickled down to the ball-point while it had been on the bureau . What the question mark meant was just this : How did Giles 's clothes  --  assuming they belong to Giles  --  come to be strewn about so ? I could n't imagine the urgency that would make such strewing necessary , not even the pangs of oncoming diarrhea . In that case , you run for the bathroom and drop your pants and shorts ; you do n't get undressed . Which reminded me that I had n't looked in the bathroom . Surely , if he were in the bathroom , he 'd have heard me come in , or if the noise of the shower or of flushing had drowned me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ear canted toward the bathroom , but I heard nothing . I heard city traffic and I heard footsteps in the corridor  --  not very loud  --  that seemed to stop at the door , or near it . For a moment , I expected to hear a key scrape against the lock and see Giles walk in , but it did n't happen , and then the footsteps , or maybe other footsteps , sounded again and faded . There was nothing to hear in the room itself . But having thought of the bathroom , it seemed logical to look inside . There might be something there to explain the incongruity of the room . I walked to the bathroom door , which was slightly ajar , and pushed it inward . And Giles was there , grinning at me silently , stretched out in the bathtub with one leg over the side , his head cradled against the metal of the faucets , apparently quite , quite nude , and , apparently , quite , quite dead .  | Although I 've spent a long time trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the room , it did n't take as long to see and to think as to describe . I doubt that I had been puzzling in the room for as long as three minutes before I walked into the bathroom . It was 1:33 P.M. of Memorial Day , May 26 , 1975 , when I discovered Giles 's body . I did n't look at my watch at that precise moment , for there was no room in my mind for anything but the absorption of the sight , but I did a couple of minutes afterward . I could n't be more than a minute off . How did I know he was dead ? From a medical standpoint , I did n't . I did n't feel for his pulse or check for traces of breathing . I did n't even find out whether the body was cold or not . Perhaps someone else might have had the presence of mind to do such a thing , but I had n't . It was the first body I had ever seen unexpectedly and it blasted me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me my heart had stopped beating . I do n't think I screamed or made any sound at all , because my vocal cords were paralyzed , and by the time I took my first , shuddering breath , seconds after the sight , I was in control again  --  very shakily . But there was no doubt in my mind , not a shred , not an atom , that he was dead . The fixed immobility of the body , the open eyes staring right at me with glassy and fixed non-recognition , the lips stretched in an unchanging grimace that was not really a smile . If I had never seen or heard of a dead human being before , I 'd have known this was an object from which life had departed . Additional details flooded into my brain over what seemed a long stretch of time that surely must have been a matter of seconds in actual fact . The leg  --  left leg  --  draped over the side of the tub was very hairy and the individual hairs were in part plastered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tub itself had traces of wetness in it . The shower curtain was partially torn down but no dead hand was clutching at it . One of Giles 's arms lolled its full length along the floor of the bathroom , the other was across his chest . The curtain itself dangled over his groin as though protecting the mod-  | esty of the corpse . The one clear thought I can remember during that long , stricken moment was one of wild relief at having Giles 's genitals covered . Then I finally drew that breath , felt my heart take up its duties , and I staggered shakily out of the bathroom . I should , in theory , have reported the matter at once , but I could n't . I had to sit down  --  or fall down . I made it to the chair from which I had , just a few minutes before , listened for noise from the bathroom . For half a minute , I continued to struggle for control . I looked at my watch and it was 1:35 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of the official time . I thought , incongruously , that Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , was about to get up to talk and that I would miss it . In the disorientation of the moment , it did n't occur to me that I might miss Shirley , too . Finally , I walked over to the bed , sat down on it , and reached for the phone . It was one of those phones with every hole in the dial marked for something and with combinations for this and that . I had no time and certainly no inclination to study the code . I dialed " Operator " and there was the usual maddening wait before the tinny feminine voice said , " Operator . Can I help you ? " I said , as flatly as I could manage , " Operator , I 'm calling to report a dead man in this room . " I 'll give her credit . There was no scream , no gasp , just a calm " What is your room number , please ? " " Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . It really was a moment , too . She must have sent out a signal that precluded fooling around . A male voice in my ear said , " Jonathan Turbeville , Assistant Manager , here . What is the problem , please ? " I said , " This is Room 1511 and the problem is that there is a dead man in the bathroom . " The name of the person registered to that room must have been passed to him by then , for he said , " Is this Giles Devore speaking ? " " No , sir , " I said . " Giles Devore will never speak again . He 's the dead man . " He did n't ask any more questions . He said , " Please stay right  | where you are , sir . There 'll be a man with you in less than five minutes . " I hung up and waited . I was back to thinking hard . 8 MICHAEL STRONG 1:40 P.M. It was indeed less than five minutes before someone answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knock on the door , I did n't for one moment believe it had any connection with my call . I assumed it was someone for Giles . If a voice other than that of Giles , my own voice , had called out for identification through a closed door , the owner of that knock might have departed . I wanted to see who it was , so I just threw the door open as quickly as I could get to it . A man stepped through and said in accents of purest astonishment , " Mr. Just ! " I stared at him , nonplussed , and then remembered . It was the guard at the door of the exhibitors ' room . We had talked yesterday afternoon and I remembered his name , Michael Strong . I even remembered his middle initial was P. I said ungraciously , " How did you get here so quickly ? " I did n't bother identifying myself . He knew me and I was still wearing my badge . " Walkie-talkie , " he said , indicating something suspended from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a dead man here ? " " In the bathroom , " I said , and followed him . Strong might have been a member of Hotel Security , but that did not mean he was used to bodies . Petty pilfering by the maids and guests who had locked themselves out of their rooms were much more his speed , no doubt . He staggered a bit when he opened the bathroom door and looked inside . I was rather glad . I was conscious of the fact that I had not handled myself too well on seeing the body and I did n't want him to shame me by doing better . He did n't . Considering that he had been warned there was a dead body in the bathroom , he did poorly indeed .  | He came out , pale , his face contorted , and said , " He 's still a little warm , but he 's dead all right . " He swallowed with an audible noise . " I guess he wo n't write ? " And he ran down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had been planning for his autograph . Perhaps he had obtained it . I removed some of the self-serving scorn I had pumped up for him . If I had remembered , I would have broken the news to him . Strong cleared his throat and tried to regain his professional aplomb . He said , " It looks to me like he finished his shower , then he slipped and fell . He grabbed the curtain , tore it down , hit his head against the faucets , and was killed . Right ? " I shrugged . I did n't for a minute believe that had happened , but I just said , " I was n't here . " " You mean you came after he was dead ? " " That 's right . " Strong looked at me in puzzlement . " How did you get in , then ? Did he leave the door open while he was taking a shower ? " " I had a key , " I said . " There it is . " And I pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key ? " " Mr. Devore gave it to me . We 're friends . After all , you told me yourself he was my protege . " I pronounced it correctly without thinking and hoped , too late , that he would understand . I suppose he did , but he went off on a new tangent . He said , " How do you mean , friends ? " My lips twitched and I tried to hold down the anger . I suppose it was a legitimate thought . " Friends , " I said , " in the dictionary definition . I 'm heterosexual . " " What ? " " I 'm straight , " I said , raising my voice . " I like girls . Under-stand ? " " Yes . But how come you got a key ? " " I had to get something for him and I just brought it up . It 's there on the bureau next to the key . " There was another knock at this point , a good loud one . I started for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the door a bit , looked through , and said , " Hello , Mr. Marsogliani , " as he opened it wide . 9 ANTHONY MARSOGLIANI 1:50 P.M. A large , stout man entered . He was a little taller than Strong and a little wider . He had a considerable paunch , a large nose , and a dark stubble against his red face . He carried a half-gone cigar which was n't lit but which smelled very bad anyway . He said , in a rolling bass-baritone , " Where 's the body , Strong ? " Strong jerked this thumb over his shoulder . " In the bathroom , boss . " Marsogliani ( I eventually got to know how his name was spelled ) vanished into the bathroom , emerged after half a minute , and said to me , " You the guy who reported the body ? " " I 'm the guy , " I said . He looked about the room with what seemed to me to be a practiced eye . His glance fell on the armchair with the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk in that direction . " Do n't touch anything , " I said hastily . He turned his head slowly and put his cold eye on me . " I 'm not going to touch anything . I 'm going to call the police . " Having taken the cigar out of his mouth to say that , he now put it back . I said , " Good . Call the police . Tell them there 's a murdered man here . " I 'd been thinking murder from the minute I had found the body and I had wondered if I could bring myself to say the word . Now I had said it , and without any trouble . " Murdered ? " Marsogliani , who had edged toward the phone , stopped , turned , and looked at me dispassionately . His appearance , his undistinguished brown suit , complete with vest , his dead cigar , had all served to give rise in my mind to the stereotype of the " dumb lawman . " His eyes did n't fit the stereotype . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I found him exactly the way you see him now . But he did n't die in the tub . He died with his clothes on . It 's a frame . " Strong looked as though he were going to jump out of his skin  | in surprise when I said that , but his boss never turned a hair . " How do you figure that out ? " I said , " I knew the murdered man , Giles Devore , well . I roomed with him for a period of time . I 've been in the rooms when he was taking a shower or getting undressed maybe fifty times . He folds his clothes . He hangs them up . He blows into his socks and flattens them out . He never throws them around like this . When I came in and saw this I thought I was in the wrong room . " " But the clothes are messed up . How do you account for it ? " " He was killed . I do n't know why . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that would make it look as though Giles were taking a shower ? " " The murderer was n't somebody who knew the man 's habits , then ? ' " No , he was n't , " I said . " Then he dragged him into the bathroom ? " Marsogliani took up the reconstruction : " ? draped him carefully with his head against the faucets , soaped him a bit , rinsed him off , pulled down the curtain , and left . " " Yes , " I said . " And all because his clothes are scattered . " " Yes , " I said again . Marsogliani looked at me from either side of that big nose of his . " The dead man is a writer , I understand . You a writer , too ? " " Yes , " I said a third time . " You write murder stories ? " ( He pronounced it " moider " but I 'm not going to try to reproduce linguistic peculiarities . ) I was relieved to be able to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you read them , do n't you ? " " Sometimes . " " Well , then , look here . Life is not like a murder mystery . In mysteries people always do the same thing . Then when some little thing is out of line , some wise-guy amateur detective makes big deductions . In real life , people do n't do the same things all the time . They do different things at different times . In real life , people are crazy . "  | He moved toward the phone again . " I 'm calling the police now . As far as I 'm concerned that 's an accident in there , but whether it 's an accident or a murder is not really my business . I just call the police and they 'll decide . You want to tell them it 's murder , you go ahead , but if you do , mister , just remember that you discovered the body , you had the key , Strong says , and you maybe had a motive . Think it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand over his . Mine was half the size and I do n't think he was the least worried about me , but he said , " Well ? " " You do n't want it to be a murder , do you ? " I said . " Bad pub-licity ? " " If it 's a murder , it 's a murder , " he said . " But I do n't want anyone yelling murder if it is n't a murder . That has nothing to do with publicity . The police do n't like it either . " And he lifted the phone as though my hand were n't weighing his down , waited a moment , and said , " Dial 911 , Myrtle . " I waited till he was finished and said , " There 's heroin in this room . " I meant it to have impact because I was sore at the guy and , for a minute , I thought I had scored because his eyelids lifted and his eyes seemed to quiver . But when he spoke , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the bureau . Right next to where I put the key . It looks like talcum powder , but one of my books involved itself with the drug culture and I know something about heroin . What I thought was talcum powder has a bitter , gritty taste and I 'm betting eight to five it 's heroin . " " Eight to five , hey ? " He walked to the bureau and said , " I do n't even see talcum powder . Come here and point it out . " I half ran to the bureau . It was clear . Marsogliani said , " Are you telling me the dead man was an ad-dict ? " " Not as far as I know , " I muttered . " He has no needle marks on him ; at least not on any exposed part of his body . The police may be able to tell better when they run an autopsy . Still , mister , if you tell them you saw heroin and  | there is n't any , there 's no way of describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to tell them anything about heroin because I do n't see any ; and I 'm not going to tell them you said anything about heroin because I do n't take anything you say seriously . But you 'll be here and if you want to tell them anything , that 's your business . It 's up to you . " l0 HERMAN BROWN 2:05 P.M. The police arrived in about ten minutes , which gave me time to think . I had made a mistake . I had shot off my mouth with nothing to back up my statements but trivia . I should have pointed to the powder before I said anything about it . Marsogliani was right . If I yelled murder and could n't prove it , they 'd turn on me and rip me apart . I did have the key , I was first man on the scene . There might even be people who would be willing to suggest I was jealous of Giles  --  that I was the toothgnashing teacher who hated the smart-ass pupil who had outdistanced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that a man my size would lug a two-hundred-pound-plus dead weight into the bathroom and tip him into the tub , but it was no secret that I was stronger than I looked . So by the time the police came , I was a different guy . If Marsogliani and Strong volunteered nothing , neither would I. Not until I had learned something of value . ( Would I ? Would I ever ? I did n't ask myself that question at this time . ) The police came by way of the basement and the service elevator , I guess , avoiding and bypassing the convention . There were two of them . The young man in uniform had longish hair and a mustache , items almost required for the new generation of police . The older man , round-faced and snub-nosed , was in plainclothes . They identified themselves . The policeman was Joseph Olsen and the plainclothesman was Lieutenant Herman Brown . The lieutenant looked bored . I suppose dead bodies were an old story to him . He walked about the room silently , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , walked into the bathroom , then came out just as though it had been empty . He asked Marsogliani and Strong how they came to be there and they laid it upon me very nicely , told their stories briefly , and left . Strong gave me a furtive glance out of the corner of his eye as though wondering what I was going to say and hoping I would make no trouble . Marsogliani left with no sign of concern at all . No skin off his nose . If Strong had stayed behind , he would have heard me deliver the minimum and make no trouble at all . Brown took my name , address , occupation , then said , " When did you find the body ? " " One thirty-three . I looked at my watch a minute or so after . " " How did you get in ? " " I had a key . Giles Devore , the dead man , gave it to me last night so that I could deliver a package . I delivered it a little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau and there 's the key . " " What 's in the package ? " " I do n't know . " " Why did he ask you to deliver it and not someone else ? " " We were good friends , " I said . He did n't give me the oh-are-you-a-queer ? look . Just scribbled in his notebook . He said , " Did you touch anything , move anything , when you came in ? " " Yes , " I said . " I did n't know he was dead in the bathroom . I came in , wondered where he was , picked up that pen on the bureau , sat in the chair  --  like that . Then I looked in the bathroom and found him . " " Why did you look in the bathroom ? " " I wanted to piss . " " Did you ? " " Not yet . " " Go ahead . " That was nice of him . I felt a little less tense when I came out . He said , " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was it on the pad when you came ? " " I drew it . " " What for ? "  | " I was wondering where Giles was . I had expected him to be up here but he was n't . It put a question mark in my mind , I suppose . " He did n't delve very deeply . I suppose with a clear case of accidental death , who needs more ? He said , " Do you know if the dead man had a family ? " " He has a wife , Eunice . " " Know her address ? " I gave it to him and he said , " All right . Are you planning any out-of-town trips ? " " No . " " Okay . Hang around just in case there are more questions . I doubt that there will be , but hang around . You can go . " " What 's going to happen to my  --  friend ? " I pointed to the bathroom . Brown said , " We 'll call the Medical Examiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autopsy . After that it will be released to his widow . " I said , " What do I do if people ask ? " For a minute , I thought he was going to smile , but he was n't in a smiling business . " You mean , is all this a state secret ? No . Talk all you want . Is the dead man part of the convention that 's going on here ? " " Yes , the American Booksellers Association . " " He 's a writer and you 're a writer . What are you doing at a booksellers ' convention ? " " Writers attend to push their books , you know . Giles was just autographing books this morning . " The lieutenant pulled out his little book again . " When this morning ? " " From ten to eleven . " " Were you there ? " " No , but there must have been a thousand witnesses . " Brown put away his book and shrugged . " Well , he wo n't be doing anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that he 's dead . Is he well known ? " " At this convention , he certainly is. "  | " Too bad , but what can you do ? Get someone to make some announcement . " He held the door open for me . " So long . We 'll be in touch if anything comes up . " I left . 11 HENRIETTA CORVASS 2:30 P.M. I went through the corridor and down the elevator in a fog of unreality . People moved about unconcerned , wearing their badges , attending the convention  --  which was still going on , of course . You do n't stop for individual tragedies . There must have been conventions going on , here and there , the day President Kennedy was assassinated and they went on . Eleven athletes were murdered at the 1972 Olympics and the games went on . It was hard for me to go on , though . Everything had turned unreal . I went to the fifth floor to find the interview room and it was far different from what it had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I pulled Henrietta aside , out of the room altogether . She objected . " What 's the matter with you ? What 's going on ? " I said in a low voice . " Emergency . Real emergency . You want me to shout it out ? " It made her nervous and she did n't try to pull her arm out of my grip any more . Maybe she remembered it had been I who had made it possible for her to take Giles to his interview the night before . We were out in the hall on the far side of the elevator bank and I said , " Look . Giles Devore is dead . " She said , " What ? " and her mouth stayed open . I said , " Dead . In the bathtub  --  dead . I found him an hour ago and the police are there now . " She said , " I was with him only ? " " What difference does that make ? Practically everyone who ever died was seen by somebody a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was n't there . All I can say is he 's lying dead in the bathtub with his head against the faucets . The police say it 's an accident . Look , you 're the only ABA official I know and I want this off my  | back . If he 's got any other commitments for the convention , cancel them . If there are any announcements to make , you make them , or have them made . If there has to be a minute of silence for mourning , or a cocktail party for celebration , or whatever , you take over . " That was it . I pulled away , kept my eyes on the floor because I did n't want to see anybody I knew . Anybody . Not for a while . Not till I had some things sorted out . I2 MICHAEL STRONG 3:00 P.M. I could n't go home . I had to stay in the hotel . I had to stay at the scene of the crime until I got over at least some of my confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . The skies would fall before Giles would have thrown his clothes about like that , and how would the killer have known that ? I could n't let it go . Damn it , I owed it to Giles to straighten it out . It was n't that we had a David and Jonathan friendship , or that I even liked him very much . It 's that I felt guilty . I had been asked to do a little errand for him and I had forgotten . He had asked me one last favor and I had flubbed it . How could I tell that my failure to deliver the package had not contributed to his murder ? I had to make it up to him . I wandered about aimlessly for a while and then , at 3 P.M. , found myself in the bar  --  in one of the bars , that is . There are a number of them in the hotel and , as a non-drinking man , none of them meant anything to me . This was one of the times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if only to have something to do and something to soften the edges of the hard lump inside me . At that time of day , the bar was n't full . I took a corner table and when the pretty waitress approached , in a little frilly crotchhigh skirt , I mumbled the only combination of sounds that I can produce that seem appropriate to the surroundings . " Virgin Mary , straight up , " I said . I 'm not sure what " straight up " means ; I think it means without ice , because if I ever say just  | " Virgin Mary " the waiter invariably says , " On the rocks , sir ? " and I know that means ice . It did occur to me that Shirley Jennifer was three floors up , signing something or other in one of the booths . I could go up there and wait for her with a sick and concerned face and she would ask me what 's up and I would tell her and she would get very motherly and take me home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't ! I ca n't explain it easily , but if I had n't met her I would have been off the hook . I would have gotten that damned package and delivered it last night . I would not have delivered it at midday today ; I would not have discovered the body ; I would not be groveling in the humiliation of having failed a friend 's last request , and maybe , in that way , having brought on the catastrophe . Had I delivered the package last night , Giles could have broken his neck , or had it broken for him , and it would have been none of my affair . I could have felt the same perfunctory sorrow that all the rest of the thousands at the convention would feel . I did n't have to sit there hopelessly involved  --  if it were n't for Shirley . Of course , I could see the flagstones which had been laid . If that woman had n't decided to wear a dress with holes in it , if I had n't been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours ago ) , if everyone had n't combined to fan my anger and turn it against Giles  --  then I would never have yelled like a madman at him , humiliated him utterly ( God , my last conversation with him ) , and forced him to leave the hotel so that he laid the errand on me in the first place But put it all together and I would still have done my bit if I had n't met Shirley . But because I met her just when I did , I was sitting in the bar , loser to wanting to be drunk than ever in my life and not knowing how to do it . It was n't Shirley 's fault ; she did n't know . But I could n't see her without thinking ? So I made no attempt to see her . I had to sit there and work it out . If Giles was killed , who killed him ? Giles had finished autographing at 11 A.M. He would have got-  | ten to his room by , say , 11:15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , say , since i P.M. That means whoever had killed him had to have done it between 11:15 A.M. and i P.M. How many people at the convention could account for their time fully between those limits ? Probably a great many , but that would leave a large number who could n't . Who would have a motive ? Lots of people would have the motive to do him a bad turn , say a nasty word about him , refuse a helping hand at crucial moments . Martin Walters was annoyed with him for standing him up in connection with a talk ; Tom and Teresa Valier were sick over his apparent abandonment of them ; Roseann Bronstein perhaps felt spurned in a more intimate way . Even Henrietta might have been irritated with his lack of cooperation . As for Asimov , he was bound to be jealous of Giles 's success . Why should n't a guy with 163 books turn a little green over someone shooting past him on his second book ? ( And why should he harp on my jealousy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of these motives was possibly deep enough for murder . Or was I wrong ? Did I know all the ins and outs of emotions ? Did I know exactly how deeply something Giles had done had cut into someone 's heart ? Did I know exactly how some small deed might fester in a particular type of personality ? Was I aware of how unconnected factors might have contributed ? Look at all the different things that had combined to reduce me to the kind of rage from which I usually do not suffer , and made me scream at Giles for what could have seemed , on the face of it , no reason at all . And who could get into Giles 's locked room if he did not , like Giles or myself , have a key . Actually , anyone . If a writer is at a convention in some field allied to writing , he is particularly vulnerable . Anyone , anyone , can knock on the door and in response to " Who 's there ? " say through the locked barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sign a book of yours that I have here ? " Theoretically , the writer could answer , " Beat it , you punk ! I 'm busy , " but I 'd bet myself a hundred to one anytime that there  | is n't a writer , certainly not a young writer , who can resist the implied flattery . And how could it be done ? It would have to be a blunt instrument at the base of the skull , something the supposed slam against the bathtub faucets could have caused . What was it ? A karate chop ? But then what would it take to drag Giles into the bathroom ? Roseann Bronstein might have been able to do it , but I 'll bet Teresa Valier could n't . But might it not have been two people working together ? And what of the heroin ? I was convinced the heroin had been there and was heroin but how on earth could I prove it , and if I could , what connection did it have with the murder ? Some connection , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind turned , I came up with nothing . I could in no way limit the possibilities or work up a reasonable list of suspects . The matter needed investigation but I lacked the talent and the facilities for that and I did n't see how I could persuade the police to do it for me . And then I heard the sound of someone clearing his throat . I looked up and it was Michael Strong , the security man , looking uneasy and unhappy . He said , " May I talk to you , Mr. Just ? " I said dully , " Are n't you supposed to be on duty ? " " Someone is covering . Just a few minutes , sir . " " Well , then , sit down . If you 're allowed to drink on duty , have one on me . " " No , thanks , " he said , and then for a while he just sat there . " Well ? " I said . " I 'm glad I found you , sir , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars . It seemed natural . " " I do n't drink , " I said , " but you found me , so three cheers for your reasoning powers . What can I do for you ? " " I  --  I want you to know , " he said , " that I 'm sorry for what happened . " He kept rubbing his hands against his thin tan jacket as though to wipe off the perspiration . His rather comical face ( or it would have been comical if I had been in the mood to smile ) was twisted into a distress that did not make it less comical.  | I was pinching my upper lip and I withdrew my hand long enough to give it a what-can-you-do ? wave and said , " Do you think he was murdered ? " " Me ? No . Did you tell the police ? ? " " No . I told the police nothing . They would n't believe it . You do n't . " " Just because the clothes were thrown around ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was n't any . " " No , not after you two came in . There was heroin before that . I 'm not crazy . You or your boss or both of you got rid of it . " He shook his head . Then said , " Why would we ? " " You would n't want murder , would you ? Bad for the hotel . You would n't want a drug scandal . Even worse for the hotel . " Strong thought about it . His brows furrowed together and he made a visible effort . He said , " Suppose there were drugs there . That works against murder . " " Really ? " " Sure . If Mr. Devore were an addict , he might have been high and then you ca n't argue what he would do or how he would handle his clothes . Maybe he might be very careful about them when he was normal , but he might throw them around when he was high . He might also be unsteady on his feet and fall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there really was heroin in the room . " It was my turn to think . What Strong said did n't exactly sound stupid . And really , how stupid could he be if he enjoyed Crossover ? That was not a stupid man 's book . Could he be right ? Was I stubbornly tying myself , emotionally , to the theory that Giles had been killed only in order to intensify my feeling of guilt over my failure in connection with the package ? I said , " When 's the autopsy ? " " Not before tomorrow . The Medical Examiner is n't even here yet . Probably wo n't get here till dinnertime . " " Why the delay ? " " It 's always that way . It takes time . There 's lots of bodies in the city at anv given time and the M.E. has to see them in order . "  | I said , " I do n't think Giles was a hophead ; I do n't think he was high ; I think he would have taken care of his clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not the one who put the clothes there . And the heroin had to have something to do with it ; I wo n't let you talk me out of its being there . " " If it were there , " said Strong , " and if Mr. Devore did not take drugs , then the heroin could have nothing to do with him at all . It could be there from the previous occupant . It could have been there for weeks . The maids do n't always do things so carefully as all that . You see what I mean ? " I saw what he meant . It seemed entirely unlikely , but it could be so . I knew even less about the whole mess than I thought I had known and my thoughts shrank inward and built a wall of silence about me . Then Strong said , " Mr. Just , if you do n't mind , I 'll have to be getting back soon . Could I explain something ? " " Go ahead , " I said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read fantasy ; as I told you yesterday , I admired Mr. Devore 's book . I got his signature on my copy of Crossover this morning , not the ones they were giving away . I just want you to know my personal feelings . " He brought out a dog-eared paperback edition of Crossover and passed it to me . I opened it to the title page and there was Giles 's signature all right , with " Best wishes " above it and " 26 May 75 " under it . The " Best wishes " looked faint and the final " s " almost was n't there , but the signature was considerably darker as though Giles had put his heart into that . It 's a phenomenon I 've often noticed with writers . No matter what they write in addition to their signature , it 's their own name into which they put their muscles and their heart . Strong said , " Would you sign your name to it , too , and date it ? " " It 's not my book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , but I 've read two of your books and I 've seen your movie . " He did n't exactly move me . I 'm not that amenable to flattery ; and if I were , I was at an unamenable moment . It seemed quite clear to me that a signature by Giles , dated the day of his death ,  | accompanied by a signature of the discoverer of the body , dated the same day , could make the book quite valuable But then I thought , hell , we were neither of us Abe Lincoln . At best our signatures would make the book worth five dollars to some collector and I had a notion that Strong would n't sell it . So let him have something that he valued greatly and that cost me nothing . I signed . No " Best wishes , " which seemed inappropriate . Just my name and the date , under those Giles had written . Absently , I admired my signature , small , neat , clear , each letter perfectly formed , and , to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roundly triangular , so that the rest of the name seemed to be suspended from a J balloon . I handed it back . " There you are . " He put it into his jacket pocket and said , " I just want to show you how I admire Mr. Devore and why I was hoping you would n't say anything about murder and drugs without any better evidence . It would make a terrible impression and could ruin his reputation . Even if everything showed it was an accident and he did n't take drugs , if something like your theory gets to the public , there 'd always be people saying he died of an overdose , or that he was killed , and that 's what he would be remembered for instead of his books . That would n't be right . " Damn it , it would n't . " I know , " I said , and went back to pinching my upper lip . One way or another , he was making it very hard for me to insist on murder . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed this moming ? " " Yes , Mr. Just . " " Well , then , you were there . Did n't Mr. Devore make a fuss while he was on the platform ? What was that about ? " " Fuss ? " Strong looked confused . " I heard he made a fuss , " I said . He shook his head slowly . " I do n't know anything about that . I came early and I was at the head of the line , third or fourth maybe . Then I had to go back to my post outside the exhibit room . Maybe there was trouble after I left . I would n't know . It could n't have amounted to much or I would have heard about it , it seems to me. "  | He got up and ducked his head as though to say goodbye , and then he said suddenly , " Do you know Mrs. Devore ? " " I 've met her once or twice , " I said . " I think she would like to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen her ? " " We tried to call her at her home , but there was no answer , and we gave up . And then at just about that time , she came in and tried to get Mr. Devore on the house phone . Naturally the operator asked her to identify herself and ? " He spread out his hands . " Where is she ? " " I 'm not sure . Last I heard she was in Public Relations . She may not be there any more . " " Where is that ? " " It 's on the sixth floor ; 622 . Only thing is , Mr. Just ? " And then he hesitated . " Yes ? " " I do n't think it would be such a good idea to talk to her about your theories . Poor woman must be in a pretty bad way ; left a widow so young . " I said , " Do n't worry about it . I have n't told the police and I wo n't tell her . Okay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , Mr. Just , you keep up the good work . Your books , I mean . You should write more . " " I will , " I said , " if I manage not to slip in the bathroom . " He looked a little shocked at the gallows humor and left . 13 SARAH VOSKOVEK 3:30 P.M. A few minutes later , I got up and left , too . I 'd met Eunice Devore oftener than the once or twice I 'd admitted to , but I had never taken to her . She was of only slightly more than average height for a woman ; five feet five would be my guess ; but she managed to look down from that height . She did n't give me the " little fella " treatment Roseann did , and I suppose I could count that on the side of virtue , but she managed to tilt her head just slightly back when she spoke to me , so that her eyes glanced unmistakably downward .  | A little thing , but I found it irritating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Women 's Liberation had become a force in the land , she was fighting her way through the world of men with long fingernails and a reinforced brassiere . She was a lawyer , wore no makeup of any kind , kept her brown hair short , her business suits mannish , her voice harsh , and her stride swinging . When I first met her , I bet myself twelve to one she was a lesbian , and I was completely taken aback ? right through the wall  --  when Giles coyly announced that they were getting married . I could n't conceive what he saw in her  --  or she in him . Nor did I ever see any inordinate display of affection between them after they were married  --  any display at all , actually . Nor did I labor , particularly , to imagine what such a display would be like . He with his hulkish slouch , she with her solid lack of all the qualities I had taught myself to consider feminine . Please ! And now , to commiserate with her on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . But I had to . Aside from the requirements of common humanity , she was the one who would be most likely to tell me whether Giles had changed his habit and whether , just possibly , I was wrong to deduce murder from the condition of his clothes . That is , I would check , but I had no fear , absolutely none , of being proved wrong . It is only the huge habits that people change without trouble . Communists can become Fascists with a day 's notice and Conservatives can crawl into the Liberal bed ( or vice versa ) with scarcely an extra breath between ; men can switch wives and mousy women can go liberationist  --  but show me a fellow who squeezes his toothpaste tube with his left hand , and I 'll show you a fellow who will never do it with his right hand , except maybe to win a bet and even then he 'll have trouble . But I would ask . The wild Game of People is not won on generalities , however sound . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and found myself facing an arrow that said " Offices . " I turned left and faced a glass door . I went through it and at once heard little Sarah 's clear and precise accented English .  | I followed it and it led me to Room 622 . There were two rooms actually , the outer one containing a desk which presumably should have been occupied by someone who served as buffer between Sarah and the world . It was vacant at the moment and I walked into the inner room . I did so slowly and softly , possibly because I did not want to attract Eunice 's attention and have to confront her without the maximum possible preparation . ( I never met a woman who looked less like her name  --  but that 's a purely subjective reaction , for who knows what a Eunice would look like in someone else 's imagination . ) If it were my intention to avoid attracting her attention , however , it was effort wasted , for Eunice was not there . It achieved another purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to remember the name ) did not hear me . Her back was to me , and she was looking at a series of large cardboard placards . Facing her , one side toward me , was a rather large , stout , white-haired , clearly uneasy man , who did give me a brief glance as I walked in , then lost interest in me at once . I sat down quietly and listened . The only reason for interrupting would have been to ask the whereabouts of Eunice and I was in no hurry . This might be more interesting . Sarah was saying , " But why four makeups on the same subject ? Each one features the lobby . " She held them up like large playing cards . I could see that there were headlines on top , others ( taillines , I wonder ? ) on bottom , and photographs in the middle . In between , there were wavy lines supposed to indicate print . The details would follow later , I suppose . One of the headlines was " The Lobby-Lovely Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone mewling and puking in his nurse 's arms . Another one was " From Lobby to Living , You 'll Love It , " which seemed only marginally better . I averted my eyes from the other two , so I 'll never know what new depths were reached . Sarah said , " I 've spent the Memorial Day weekend here in the office , but I 'm not letting this pass . Why the lobby ? Who 's interested in lobbies ? The lobby is just an extension of the street , airconditioned in summer and warmed in winter , but that 's all . It 's  | always crowded , always busy , always strange and cold . We 're selling rooms , beds , closets , windows , dining rooms , ballrooms , conference rooms , every blessed thing but lobbies , and after all our discussions you come here with four lobbies . " The man managed to speak here in what I think he imagined to be an ingratiating tone . " I think they got the idea from you , Sarah . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell a hotel by its lobby . " " I never said any such thing , " said Sarah , staring the man down . " I would like to know who said I did . Exactly who . Find out for me . Just ask and find out exactly who is willing to swear I said that . Even if I had done so , would that be worth four lobby makeups , with not even a single backup in case the lobby idea is sour ? ? which it is . " " But what are we going to do now ? " " You 'll work all night , if you have to . If you had had this in last week as you were supposed to ? " " Come on , Sarah , you ca n't push these things too much . " " I 'm trying to push them enough . Anyway , these are out . Remind everyone there 's a recession on and we ca n't get by without something good  --  and these things are putrid . " She tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't see her face , but if ever a beehive hairdo looked downcast from the back , hers was it . The man got up , gathering the placards together and said , " Well , I 'll call you tomorrow morning . And I think someone 's waiting for you . " She turned around rapidly , and when she saw who it was , she reddened . I imagine she flushed easily ; her skin was quite fair ; almost startlingly so against her dark hair and eyes . Flawless , too ? at least the parts I could see . It was a pity she could n't be stretched out into something taller . She said , " I 'm sorry , Darius . I did n't know you were there . " The use of the first name caught me by surprise till I remembered we had placed ourselves on a first-name basis on our previous meeting . Actually , I liked the way she pronounced it . I said , " It 's all right . It was a pleasure watching you work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I must have sounded petulant to you . " " They looked like lousy ads to me . " " Were n't they ? It 's not really my job to backstop design , but they do such stupid things when they 're left to themselves . Imagine saying that I said you could judge a hotel from its lobby . " " You might be able to . " " Never . Ours is terrible . It 's like Grand Central used to be . There 's even a porno newsstand . " " Where ? " " Well , almost porno and never mind where . But I 'm talking nonsense . I 've been kept so busy that I 've forgotten what a miserable time you had since I last saw you . I understand that you went up to the room and found your friend dead . I 've been thinking you must have been suspecting such a tragedy or you would not have run off so  --  so ? " ( for the first time I heard her stumble over an English word ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Distraught . Did you expect to find him dead ? " " No . Never . Anything but that . Your remarks had just put it into my head that I had promised to run an errand for him and I had forgotten . By the time I got to his room ? " " He was dead , " she said . " I hope there was no connection . " " I do n't see how that could be , " I said gruffly , but she had put her finger very efficiently on my particularly howling worry . " Did you tell anyone that I had run off like that ? " " Oh , no , " she said . " I thought you might be in trouble and it was not my wish to make that trouble worse . Of course , if I had been asked directly , I could n't very well have lied about it . " She smiled , something I had n't seen her do before , and she had nice , even teeth  --  front teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , where you quickly learn not to volunteer information . Still , there are many around us who saw you run off . " " I know , but you 're the only one who knew exactly what you said to me that made me run off . And talking about Giles , I understand his wife was here in this room and that she wants to see me. "  | " Yes , but how did you know that ? " " Ah , " and I smiled , too , something it was a relief to be able to do , " but , you see , I do n't volunteer information either . " " But I asked you . It is not a matter of volunteering . " " Does it matter that you do not know ? " " It always matters for a woman not to know . " " Sexist nonsense ! " I said , and rejoiced ( and by no means for the first time ) at the weapon the liberation movement had handed over to the occasional male chauvinist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . ) " Very well , then , " she said , coming dangerously close to a pout . " Yes , Mrs. Devore did say that she would like to see you . She is a very strange woman . Do you know her well ? " " No . " " Do you like her ? " " No . " " She seemed so in charge of herself , even though her husband was lying dead upstairs . Her voice did not tremble . Her hands were quite steady . I 'm told she did n't even wince at the news . " I said , " She 's a successful career woman who has schooled herself to take things as they come . She 's forged her way through a male society before the liberation movement came to help , and that takes guts . " " I thought you said you did n't like her . " " I do n't . But in some ways I admire her . Where is she ? " " She 's upstairs . Waiting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at my watch . It was edging past 3:40 ? not yet twentyfour hours since I had arrived at the convention . " When the hell will he come ? " I muttered . " There are many ? " " I know ; many bodies waiting . But you 'd think they 'd want to autopsy fresh meat " She winced , and I said , " I 'm sorry . That was a foul thing to say . It 's just that I 'm feeling tired and bitter . " " I understand . " I made a little quasi-salute gesture and left .  | 14 EUNICE DEVORE 3:45 P.M. Back up to 1511 . It was not my idea of anything I wanted to do . I knocked at the door and after a while it opened a bit and the eye of Officer Olsen appeared there . I guess if you 're a cop and are carrying a gun , you do n't have to be as careful about asking who 's there as ordinary people do . I said , " Hi . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Mrs. Devore 's in there , can I get in to see her ? Tell her it 's Darius Just . " She must have heard me , for I heard Eunice 's husky voice say , " Let him in . I want to see him . " Olsen opened the door for me and closed it after me . The room had been straightened out . Eunice was sitting in one chair and the policeman took the other . I considered the bed , discarded the idea , and sat down on the low bench-like affair next to the bureau , where a suitcase would ordinarily be put . Eunice was looking particularly plain , rather more than the forty-two years I knew she was . She was a dozen years older than Giles , if you wanted another factor that made for the mesalliance . She must have seen the quick glance I cast at the bathroom door just before I sat down and promptly read my mind , though that must have been one of the easier telepathic tasks . She said , " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose one of these days the M.E. will be over . It 's silly taking an autopsy in a case like this , but necessary . You go through the routine to avoid trouble . If you leave out an autopsy , there may be legal complications of all sorts and better a thousand useless autopsies than one set of ensuing complications . " It was almost as though she were anesthetizing herself by talking like the lawyer she was . I said , " Sorry for the delay , but I was told you were down in Room 622 . " " I was , " she said , " but I did n't stay . " Her nose was shiny and her hair was bedraggled . " If I had been penned in with that  | niminy-piminy any longer I 'd have broken down the door to get out . " " What niminy-piminy ? " I asked , even though I knew very well what niminy-piminy . " That peewee with the voice . With her hair up and her mouth tight and her tits squeezed forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words coming out and being nearly bitten off . She 's not human . It must take her two hours every morning to put herself together and three hours every evening to shake herself apart and pick up the loose pieces . " I guess she did n't like Sarah any more than Sarah liked her . Less , maybe . Six hours before , I would have rejoiced at that little speech , and even now I had to admit it was n't a bad word picture on the malevolent side . Still , Sarah had apologized to me manfully ( womanfully ? ) and she was making it in a man 's world , too . And for that matter , whatever Sarah 's artificiality , I preferred it to Eunice 's over-natural look . I was n't close enough to Eunice to get a whiff of underarm odor but I bet myself even money it was there . However , I did n't take up Sarah 's part . I let it go . My task now was to keep Eunice in good enough temper to answer my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Eunice about the  --  the tragedy . We were very close , Giles and I , for a while . " " Very close indeed , Just , if you had his key , " she said dryly . " That 's what I want to talk to you about . But not here . I 've identified him , and that 's enough for here . " I said to the policeman , " All right if I use the phone ? " " What for ? " " To get us another room to talk in with less company . " He shrugged . Eunice said , " Who 're you calling ? " I said , " The peewee with the voice . " It did n't take too long . I knew I could count on Sarah . In a while a key came up and we moved over into 1524 , which was be-  | tween occupants . We had till six , we were told . I sure as hell did n't want to spend any longer  --  if as long . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you want to stay here ? Shall we go have a drink ? Are you hungry ? " " No , " she said sourly . " We 'll stay here . I just want this over with . What I want from you is the story of what happened . How did he manage to die ? " I said , " Eunice , I do n't know . When I came into the room , he was already dead . " " Yes , that 's what you told the police , I gather . " " That 's what really happened . And because it 's the truth , I 'm not telling you anything different . " " All right , then , tell me about the key . Giles has n't gone homosexual , has he ? " " For all I know , he may have , " I said icily , and managed not to point out I would consider it an improvement when compared to marriage with her , " but I have n't . He gave me the key last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I forgot . I did it today during the luncheon and he was dead when I got there . " " And is there a connection ? " " Post hoc , ergo propter hoc ? " " You know Latin , I see , " she said , without admiration . " I know that much . Do you think that because he was killed after I had slipped up on my errand , that he was killed because I had slipped up . " She shrugged . " Why did you forget ? " " Irrelevant , immaterial , and incompetent . " " You 've been watching Perry Mason , " she said . " Well , since you deny you 're a homosexual , I suppose a girl was involved . " I kept quiet . She was a formidable harridan with an absolutely uncanny way of guessing what went on in your mind . I had experienced that before and I suppose it was a great help to her as a lawyer . How had Giles ever had the guts to marry her , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , then , that 's it . He fell in the bathtub . They 'll run the autopsy and give him to me . I 'll see him buried , probate  | the will , if he 's made one  --  I swear I do n't know if he 's made one ? and that will be it . Do you know if he 's got any family , parents , siblings ? " " Do n't you know ? " I asked . " He never mentioned . I never questioned . " I shrugged . " He had a father some years ago who would send him money now and then , but I ca n't say where he 's to be found , or even whether he 's still alive . And I do n't know anything about any other relatives . " She said , " I daresay they 'll all show up , right down to the third cousin , each expecting to be remembered in the will and assuming Giles to be a lot wealthier than he was . " She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunt , and said , " That 's all , Darius . You can run along now . " I found the grace of the remark somewhat less than lovable and would have longed to tell her so in my own inimitable fashion , but I was still playing for cooperation . I sat where I was and said , " But it 's not quite all . Do you mind if I ask you some questions , Eunice ? I promise it 's for good reason . " She hesitated , looked at her watch , sat down again , and said , " Well , till the M.E. arrives , there 's nothing to do , so go ahead . " And then , as though her remark had been too ungrudging , she added , " Provided you do n't take forever . " " How 's Giles been lately ? " I asked . " Same steady son of a bitch he 's been for quite a while . " Not perhaps the most loving remembrance of a freshly dead husband , but I was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You do n't know if he was on drugs , do you ? " " No , not as far as I know  --  and I think I would have known . " " Has he been seeing a psychiatrist ? " " No , not as far as I know  --  and I think I would have known . " " Has he changed any of his little habits ? " She let out a harsh squawk of laughter . " He ? You should know some of his little habits . They never change . " I nodded and said , " That 's the thing . When you came into his room , was it the way it was when I came in a little while ago ? " " Yes , essentially . "  | " Giles 's clothes were n't in sight ? " " They were in the closet and they were being taken out and everything about them was being marked and itemized . " " There was nothing on the bed or chairs ? " " His clothes ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . " She said , " None better . He blows in his socks and folds them and folds everything else and makes a neat little pile of them like Mommie always told him to do . You roomed with him once ; you know . " " But he has n't changed that habit ? " " You can bet anything you want he has n't . " " All right then . How about this ? When I came in and found him , his clothes were thrown over the chair and floor . You know that ca n't be him . " " It ca n't . So ? " " So someone else must have done that . Someone else was there . And why should the someone else have spread the clothes like that except to make it look as though Giles were taking a shower when he was n't ? " Eunice said , " You mean we 're faced with a murder made to look like an accident ? " For once her ability to read minds was useful . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does n't it look that way to you ? " " Because the clothes are scattered ? That 's not enough . No jury would buy that . " " The hell with a jury ; do n't be a lawyer . I 'm talking about you and me , so be a person . Would you buy the fact that it was murder on the basis of the scattered clothes ? " " It 's an interesting thought , " she said , unmoved . " It 's possible . But there should be more evidence . " For a moment I thought of telling her about the heroin , but decided not to . There was absolutely nothing but its physical presence to connect it to Giles , and that physical presence no longer existed . In fact , I could n't even absolutely swear to its being heroin in full certainty .  | I said , " What about the shower bit ? I never knew Giles to shower in the middle of the day . " " You do n't know much , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman with him . " I paused a moment . " Are you suggesting he had a woman with him , and he took a shower and fell and killed himself ? " " Why not ? And the woman , not wanting to be involved , for which one ca n't blame her , quietly eases out and lets someone else find him . " " And his clothes , " I said . " Would she scatter them around , after he had taken them off and folded them all neatly ? Why improve on him ? " " Because the poor mutt might have thought that he folded everything neatly to make an impression on her and that if he had been taking a shower by himself , he would have thrown them about . So she threw them about to make it look as though no one had been there but Giles . " I was rattled . My God , it made sense . " Do you think that hap-pened ? " " Not really . Any woman who knew Giles would know that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who did n't know Giles would be far too panicky to fool around with the clothes . She would just get the hell out of the room . " " Then all this stuff about a woman with him does n't amount to anything . Why do you bring it up ? " I was irritated . " Because any lawyer would , and by the time he was through , your notion of deducing murder from messed-up clothes would be shredded into nonexistence . I 'm showing you . Besides ? " " Yes . " She seemed lost in thought for a moment , then she said , " Besides , I do n't think poor Giles had a girl with him anyway . It is very hard for him to find anyone to cooperate with him . Except me , of course . " The natural question would have been : Why not ? I hung back , though , and did n't ask it . For one thing it would have been a clearly prurient intrusion on someone 's private sex life , and for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | But Eunice laughed and exercised her frightening ability to see what I must be thinking . " Of course , " she said , " you want to know what I 'm talking about , but you feel it is n't gentlemanly to ask . Do n't hesitate . I do n't give a damn whether you know or not . In these rotten permissive days , it does n't matter if everyone knows . " Look , when I met Giles , he was a virgin . He was incapable of sex in the ordinary routine sense of the word  --  I 'm using routine ' to cover a broad territory  --  and he 's still incapable of it . He had to be babied into it , and I mean that literally . We stumbled onto that fact more or less accidentally as a result of what teen-agers might call fooling around ' and it worked so well that we got married . " The thing is , he has to be undressed while he moves his arms and legs aimlessly and makes little gurgling sounds . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't easy , but he moved his body in such a way as to help , though he pretended he was n't . I had to make soothing noises to him and take him to the bathroom and bathe him carefully , sometimes by shower , sometimes in the tub , depending on how much time we had . Afterward I had to thy him , powder him , right down to the Q-sticks for the folds in his outer ear . I had to pretend to suckle him and then , finally , he 'd be ready for sex in the ordinary sense of the word . He could be pretty good at it if all the preliminaries went well . " I sat there frozen with horror . The man had occupied an adjacent bedroom to mine for over two months  --  and I had babied him , too , in my way . He had come in for help , like a little boy to his father , and , intellectually , I had fathered him as , more physically , Eunice had mothered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black forest . God , height and weight and size and bulk could be as great a burden as lack of all of them . What was it like to look out over the heads of the world and to reject the role that sheer size had thrust upon you ? Eunice said , " For God 's sake , Just , do n't sit there looking censorious . If you want to know , I liked it . I liked every bit of it ; it turned me on , too . Even if I had n't , the end paid off . So what 's to  | complain about ? Since it 's between consenting adults , who 's hurt ? Your sense of propriety ? How do you get to the point ? A drink , a giggle , a kiss on the shoulder , the slipping of fingers up a thigh ? " " I do n't drink , " I said . " Listen , is this the way Giles would want it with anyone ? " " It 's the only way . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point . " She grinned sourly . " If you know what I mean . " " Well , then , if you undress him , what do you do with the clothes ? " " I thought you 'd ask . I fold them neatly in a cute little pile . Otherwise , he cries ; I mean cries . I suppose it all traces back to his real mother , to the kind of compulsively neat object she was , and to whatever games they played . " She sighed . " The hell with it . " " And he never went to a psychiatrist ? " " Why should he ? It gave him pleasure and it did n't hurt him , or get in his way , either personally or professionally . Would you go to a psychiatrist to be cured of your vile impulse to eat when you 're hungry ? " " And you liked it all ? " " Who knows what you like ? " She was right . I had to stop playing Puritan . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he likes the game , why is he a son of a bitch now ? Has he changed ? " " Of course he 's changed . He found out he likes variety . You have to go through the same routine every time , but he likes to have different mothers , to experience different touches , different mouth odors , different nipples , who knows what ? There was that bookstore owner downtown , the broad one . Now there 's a motherly type for you . " Look who 's getting into the judgment business now , I thought . And then it occurred to me that Eunice and Roseann were alike in many ways . If Giles liked one , why not the other ? I said , " You mean that they played the game , too ? " " I didn t take photographs , Just , but let 's say they did . Bronstein , that 's her name . Yes , they did . I 'm satisfied with the evidence , even if a jury might not be . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room with him ? " " Is she at the convention ? She 's a bookseller ; she ought to be . " " I met her in the hotel yesterday , " I admitted . " Then she might have been . " I said , " But she 'd know enough not to mess up the clothes , whether he died by accident or she killed him . " Eunice said , with sour reluctance , " Yes , I suppose she would . " Then she said , " Well , never never mind that . After Giles discovered the pleasure of variety , Bronstein did n't last long with him either . He left her and went after anything female , I think . And it was only after he was frustrated by enough refusals that he turned to me . " " Was he always refused ? " " Just about always . Eventually , though , he discovered he could buy cooperation and for the last six months he never turned to me once . The son of a ? " She let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Does he always play the game the same way , all the way , with everybody ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well , look , suppose he found someone at the the convention . There are bound to be some who would n't mind . " " Yes , " she said , " some of us crazies . Yes . " " Very well . He got some girl at the last minute , but he has n't cleared the situation very well with her ; he might even have brought back a professional . Would he be desperate enough to accept some shortcuts ? I mean , would it be all right to undress him but not to fold his clothes , as an example ? " " I 've never witnessed the game with anyone else , " said Eunice , " so I ca n't give strong evidence . I 'm pretty sure that he would n't play . He would cry and he would n't go to the bathroom and you ca n't take him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So it ca n't be a woman , " I said . " Any woman who knew him would play the game properly ; any woman who did n't know him would play it properly or it would n't get played . In either case , the clothes would be folded . If they were folded and Giles died in  | any fashion , why should anyone take the time to strew them around ? Do n't you see , it works down to this ; that he had to die with his clothes on and that someone did n't know Giles 's peculiarities , so he had to take the clothes off him while he was dead , toss them about , and take him into the bathroom . And why on earth do that but to convert murder into apparent accident . " " Except , " said Eunice , " that it 's been six months since the last time I played the game and for all I know there has been a change . " " Do you believe that ? " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer would point that out . " " The hell with lawyers , " I said desperately . " What do you think ? Murder or not . " " I do n't think anything , just . Let it be to hell with lawyers but I 'm one and what strikes me as important is what the jury thinks . The jury would decide on accident after listening to the evidence . " " Does n't it bother you that juries can be wrong ? Does n't it bother you that it might be murder whatever they say ? " " Why ? Suppose I say : It 's murder . Does that bring Giles back to life ? " " Do you want the murderer to get away with it ? " " What murderer ? That 's another thing . If you decide Giles was murdered , you would have to think about the matter of who murdered him . Who had a motive ? And who was strong enough to get his dead body into the bathroom ? He weighed two hundred and twenty pounds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lip curled . " You 're wondering if it could have been Eunice Devore . The first suspect in the death of a husband is the wife , right ? " I felt uneasy and shrugged . " I do n't say that , " I said . " Say it , and let 's go over the evidence . First , do I have a motive ? Sexual frustration , unhappy marriage , he 's been talking about a divorce . I 'm sure he meant to consult a lawyer right after his new book was published and was clearly a best seller . If I kill him and make it look like an accident , I spare myself humiliation ,  | get a kind of revenge , probably inherit the bulk of his estate , which might not be a bad one at that , if this new book makes a good movie sale , as it might . Going against that is the fact that I am not a very sexually driven woman , that I have no objection to a divorce , and that I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means . Could I have killed him ? Why not ? I 'm as strong as a man and he 's a flabby person . I could have made use of something that would serve as a bludgeon , break his neck , and take the weapon away with me . Or I could have used a karate blow ? " " Karate ? " I asked with sudden interest . " Yes , I 've taken lessons in karate . I work late at night in the city sometimes and a woman needs to know the art of selfdefense , I 'm told , though the fact is that I 've never been attacked . The idea of karate came to me once when Giles told me that you were an expert in it . I 'm not . I do n't know if I could crack Giles 's spine just under the skull with one quick sidewise strike of my hand . I imagine you could , however . " I said , " And how would I carry him into the bathroom ? " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " She looked at my shoulders appraisingly . " I think you could do it . " I said , " Dragging would have left traces , I suspect . Or maybe not . I do n't know . Anyway , what 's my motive ? " She said , " Who cares ? That 's nonsense about motives . Anyone could have a motive and anything suits for a motive . He could have called you a little squirt or he could have said you were a lousy writer or he could have insulted your sainted mother . What 's the difference ? It was something that made you lose your temper . " But let 's go on to the third , opportunity . I was in the city all day ; I have no alibi , I could have been here . So I 've got motive , means , and opportunity  --  and the only catch is that I did n't do it . Did you ? " " No , I did n't , " I said , dismissing the matter as though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , how was it you were in town ? How long have you been here ? " She raised her eyebrows . " Since about four P.M. yesterday . Do you want an explanation ? "  | " I ca n't make you give one . Do you want to offer one ? " " Nothing is easier than the truth . He called me . He had left a package at home ? " " A package ? " I have a feeling my eyes bugged at that one , for Eunice looked at me with amusement and said , " Yes , a package . Have I given myself away with that ? Am I guilty ? " " No . Go on . " " He called me up , told me where the package was , asked me if I could bring it in . I said I would try . The point was , it would serve as a possible excuse to visit my brother , whom I had n't seen in over a year for all we live only forty miles apart . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the weekend , and he said , Come over . ' " I did . I brought the package with me . I called Giles 's room , and he was n't in . I did n't expect him to be  --  unless he were with a woman , in which case I do n't think he 'd answer . So I checked the package and left the ticket at the desk for him . They put it in an envelope , and put a message buzzer on the gizmo in his room ; at least that 's what they told me they would do . Off I went to my brother 's  --  he lives about ten miles from here  --  and I spent the night there . " I shook my head . " I wish they had sent the package up to his room and had the maid take it in . " " Why ? He got it , did n't he ? I saw it lying on the bureau when I came in , just before they put it into a canvas bag with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it back . So much for bringing it in yesterday . " " That 's the errand I had to run , Eunice , " I said , in self-disgust . " He got the ticket last night and never had time to go to the checkroom . He gave me the ticket and the key and asked me to get it for him . I did , but not till lunch today and he was dead by then . " " Oh , well . Big deal . " I said , " When I first said I had forgotten to run an errand for him you asked if there was any connection with his death . Now you dismiss it as unimportant . Why ? Do you happen to know what there was in the package ? "  | " Of course I know . He gets them all the time . Pens . His own special triangular blue pens with his name monogrammed on them . I 'm the one who first got them for him . I could n't stand his fiddling with the ordinary ball-points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and dropping the springs . " " You were married to him , too , then , " she said , with some sarcasm . " In a way , " I said . " Well , they 're his babies now , comfortable to his finger , comfortable to his ego , cheap , disposable . As far as I know , they have only two disadvantages . They do n't last long , but run dry quickly . The other disadvantage is that he puts them back in his pocket when they 're dry and its up to me to check the pens in his inner jacket pocket and throw them out if they 're dry . " I nodded . I could guess now the nature of the fuss at the autographing table . Giles had tried to autograph books with a nearly dry pen ( the one on the bureau in his room , no doubt , the one with which I had drawn the question mark , using the last dregs of ink that had settled down to the point after it had run dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of his pens since I had not brought them to him and he had had to use some nonmonogrammed pen that did n't set well in his fingers . That would have a lot to do with his annoyance with me ; everything to do , in fact  --  and even recognizing his neurosis with respect to pens , I could scarcely blame him . But how would a dry pen contribute to his murder ? It might make him murder me out of petulance , but it was n't something to induce the murder of him . It still meant , however , that I had contributed to his discomfort , frustration , and anger on the last morning of his life , and that would remain bitter in my memory . I said to Eunice , " Apparently you did n't stay at your brother 's . You left this morning . " " So I did , Just . I ca n't stand those kids of his and his wife is no bargain , either . I keep forgetting , but then when I visit I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How early this morning did you leave ? " " Right after breakfast . "  | " And came here ? " " No , I did n't come here . I was n't here during the crucial hours when the death took place . Some stores were open and I went shopping . " " Did you buy anything ? " " No , but I was n't seriously intending to . Nobody I knew saw me . I told you ; I have no alibi . " " But why did you come here ? " And for the first time , Eunice grew uneasy . Her eyes , which had been staring into mine with almost insolent carelessness , dropped . Her voice lowered . " I thought I might see Giles . It had been a rotten night last night . I knew he was signing books this morning , and I thought that might put him into a good humor . I thought he might be willing to ? If I stayed overnight here , I ? " I sat there , appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warning whatever , and I did n't want to have to try to put her together again . She said , " But instinctively he knew I was coming and rather than have anything to do with me , he bashed his head or arranged to have it bashed for him and said goodbye to me once and for all . The son of a ? " And two large tears overflowed and furrowed down her cheeks . I stared at her helplessly . She said , " You 're going to sit there and watch me cry ? Well , screw you , sonny , I 'm not crying . " She took a deep breath , passed the back of her hand over her eyes , and said , " I 'm going back to his room . Maybe the Medical Examiner is there . I 've got to arrange for the funeral . " She went to the door , opened it , and walked through , turning to the left toward 1511 . She did n't bid me farewell , and that did n't bother me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . 15 ROSEANN BRONSTEIN ' 5:15 P.M. I did n't have much of a desire to leave the room . Not at once . I had till six before I would be forced to go and what bothered me was that I had nowhere to go , nothing to do .  | Wherever it was I went , whatever it was I did , it would have to be aimed at solving this damned puzzle . In two or three days , probably , Giles would be buried and I would have to attend some sort of memorial service , I knew . And I must , for my own piece of mind , know something by then . ( Or was I just setting myself deadlines , as I was accustomed to do in connection with this chapter or that in my novels , in order to force myself to get them done ? ) Well , why was he murdered ? So far , I had a trivial complication to his life and a serious one . The trivial one was the dry pen owing to my failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pens could have anything to do with it . ( Or was I just trying to rid myself of responsibility ? ) There was also the serious complication involved in the sexual frustration of two women , Eunice and Roseann . ( Who would ever have thought of Giles Devore as an homme fatal driving two women to distraction ! ) Of the two , I was sure Eunice had n't killed him . She guessed , too quickly , that I was hinting at murder . Surely , if she had been a murderer she would have been very careful not to see my hint at all . She would stubbornly have veered away from the word and concept . ( Or am I just being a romantic ? ) What about Roseann ? Where could I find her ? I might try wandering about the hotel , looking for her , but the fact was that I could wander forever and never bump into her by accident , even if she were in the hotel ? which was as large as a small town . And she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor could I think of anyone whom I might ask and who might know where she was . I thought awhile , staring out the window at an unappetizing section of walls and windows as seen blurrily through an off-white curtain . Roseann must have found out about Giles 's death . Henrietta would have had it announced , and it might even have made the radio and television news by now . And if she had heard , and she had been in the process of desperately trying to win him back to that horrible game he played with obliging women , surely her re-  | action would be one of despair . Would she go to a bar and get drunk ? Would she jump off the roof , shrieking imprecations at fate ? Would she go home and sob herself to sleep ? I could n't check every bar in town , and if she had jumped off the roof , I had a feeling I 'd hear about it soon enough . As for home , that was easy enough to check . It required only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it did n't belong to me and the tab would be placed firmly on the wallet of the guy who was arriving to take the room this evening . I refused to worry about it , though , and told myself I would straighten out the matter with Sarah . The phone was of the type where dialing q would give me an outside line automatically . That was good , for it meant I did n't have to go through the operator , who might , after all , object to completing a call from an unoccupied room ( or would she know it was unoccupied ? ) . I dialed q and then the number of the bookstore , which the telephone directory had been kind enough to give me . The bookstore would n't be open on Memorial Day , I supposed , but she lived in several rooms above it . She probably had an extension upstairs . I let it ring fifteen times on the theory that she might not have an extension upstairs and might have to hurry downstairs to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , no one would answer . I lost my bet by a nose when the receiver was lifted on the fifteenth ring . The voice was a low croak , absolutely unrecognizable , and I suspected a wrong number . " Roseann ? " I said tentatively . " What the hell do you want ? " came the voice , somewhat stronger . I recognized it now . " It 's Darius Just . " " I know it is . What the hell do you want ? " She did n't call me little fella . She was really in a bad way . " I 'm sorry , Roseann , but have you heard about Giles ? " " Yes , I heard about him . You 'd think that rotten bastard could keep on his feet in the bathtub. "  | That made two women who called him names for daring to be dead . I said , " Roseann , did you see Giles since you and I talked yes-terday ? " " No , I did n't , and what business is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have told her I had , but to what end ? No point in repeating what he had said . Not now . I said , " Roseann , I 'm puzzled about something . " " What are you talking about ? " " Look , when I came into his room ? ' " You found him . Yes , I know . Maybe you pushed him . " She was being completely unreasonable . I said , " Listen , Roseann , when I came into his room , he was already dead . He was in the bathtub as though he had been taking a shower , and his clothes were thrown all over the room . It was as though he had taken them off and just tossed them every which way as he was getting ready for his shower . " There was silence at the other end for so long that I was about to jiggle the contacts , then she said , in a more normal voice than any I had heard her use , " But that 's impossible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two things . I was certain now that Roseann had played the game with Giles , and the second was that she clearly agreed that the clothes could not have been strewn by Giles . She said , " You mean someone else tossed those clothes around ? Some woman ? No , he would n't let that happen . " Then she , too , made the leap which , it seemed to me , declared her innocent . " You mean someone killed him and then spread the clothes around to make it look as if he had an accident while he was taking a shower ? " " Do you think that 's possible ? " " I do n't know , I ? Yes , of course it was possible , " she exploded suddenly . " It was Eunice . " " Eunice ? "  | " Of course . If she could n't have him , then no one could . " " That ca n't be , Roseann , " I said , deliberately lying to see if she had reason to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a rigid and solid alibi . " Roseann made a croaking sound that might have been intended for laughter . She said , " Do you suppose she would do it herself . She hired somebody . You do n't have to invest much these days to get someone killed . " " Do you have evidence for that , Roseann ? " " I do n't need evidence . " " You do , legally , if you 're going to say things like that . Besides , it may occur to someone that your motive is the same as Eunice 's and as strong . " " Mine ? " " If you ca n't have him , then no one can . " And she screamed , " Oh , do n't be a goddamn jackass , " and crashed the phone into its cradle . Much more slowly and gently , I hung up . Well , what had I accomplished ? Both got my hint at murder without trouble , which made me tend to eliminate them from suspicion . To be sure , Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of accusing Roseann , which she had clearly wanted to be able to do . Roseann , on the other hand , could and did accuse Eunice at once . That , however , might merely reflect the fact that Eunice was a lawyer and Roseann was not . And meanwhile Roseann had brought up the point of a hired killer . Why not ? It did n't sound likely , but why not ? That would mean that alibis meant nothing . And perhaps the trace of heroin I had found was the sort of thing that a hired killer might have left behind . ( Why ? I could n't say why . ) It was no use . In the last five hours I had thought harder and longer and steadier and more monotonically than I had ever done for an equal period at any time in my life . Not even when I was plotting my novels had I thought harder and longer  --  and yet it had all brought me exactly nothing . I was no wiser now than at the start  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have thought of myself .  | But it was almost six and a customer would be arriving at any moment . I placed the key on the bureau , walked out the door of 1524 , and locked it behind me . I was still thinking . 16 GWYNETH JONES 5:55 P.M. The elevator took its time , but as it happened I was in no great hung . Since I could n't believe ( and did n't want to believe ) that the murder depended on the triviality of the pens and my failure , and since it did n't seem to me to involve either Eunice or Roseann , the motive had to rest elsewhere  --  another unsuspected woman , the heroin , a homicidal maniac ( no , would a homicidal maniac bother to arrange an accident ? ) . In search of that motive , it might serve to track down everything Giles had done from the time he left me nearly twenty-four hours earlier to the time of his death . The elevator still was n't coming . It was approaching dinnertime and people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life went on . People were hungry . I was n't . When I last saw Giles , he was leaving with Henrietta Corvass . If I began with her The elevator came to the floor , going down . It was full and there was a halfhearted squeezing backward to make room for me . I stepped in . I do n't take up much room : I 'll say that for me . I gave the group in the elevator one sharp glance to see if I recognized anyone . I was in no mood to talk . Luckily , there was no need to . With thousands at the convention , in any random group of a dozen or so I would know no one . I turned to face the front . The others were all conventioneers . They all wore badges . I sighed and tried to be unobtrusive about taking mine off . I got off at the fifth floor and found the interview room still open . It surprised me ; I had assumed it would have closed at five and I had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one person inside , a young woman with straggly hair , unobtrusive breasts , and sneakers . Her legs were spraddled apart as she slouched back in her chair and looked thoughtfully at what I assumed were releases . She had a sheet of paper in the typewriter and would undoubtedly begin typing in a moment . I looked at her legs , but that was unrewarding , so I looked at her nameplate and that said , " Gwyneth Jones . " " Gwynethl " I said to myself in disbelief . I said it to myself just a touch too loudly , for the young woman assumed I was trying to attract her attention ( which I meant to do in a moment ) , looked up , and said , " Yes ? " I said , " You would n't know where Henrietta was , would you ? " The girl looked at me thoughtfully and said , " Henrietta Cor-vass ? " I said , out of curiosity , " Is there another Henrietta around ? " " No . She 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " We 've got to be accurate . " " I 'll start over . You would n't know where Henrietta Corvass was , would you ? " " As long as we 're starting over , who are you ? " I fumbled for my badge and showed her and got a blank stare . " I 'm a writer , " I explained . " Now what about Henrietta ? Do you know where she is ? " And after all that , Gwyneth said , indifferently , " No . " I said , " Look , sweetheart , pretend it 's an emergency . Suppose your bra strap broke and Henrietta had the only spare in the place . Where would you look for her ? Guess , if you have to . Give me a start . " She said . " I do n't wear bras . I think I heard her say something about the Sewall , Broom party tonight . Maybe she 'll be there . " " Thank you , sweetheart . And where will the party be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's a flyer somewhere around . " She looked about the top of her desk halfheartedly and said , " I 'm behind in my work , you know . " " I know , " I said . " I could tell . But spend five more minutes looking for it , will you ? " I bet myself eight to five she would n't find it and I lost . She got  | to it in less than a minute . She was a short girl and uninteresting but I kissed her on the cheek and said thanks . She did n't look overwhelmed with gratitude . I went off to find a men 's room , where I took care of my biologic needs , washed my hands and face , looked earnestly at myself to see if I looked as crummy as I felt and decided I did , but what the hell . I 'm not strikingly handsome , but I 'm not grotesque either . I fall into that broad in-between that 's called " attractive " in various tones of voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself. * I leaned against the towel dispenser and studied the flyer . The party was not in the hotel but at a restaurant nearby , and it was slated to start at 6:30-I had some twenty minutes , so I found myself a seat in an odd , sequestered comer of the lobby and let my eyes close . I remember wondering if that might be the place where the semi-pomo bookstand Sarah had referred to could be found . I lacked the energy to look for it , so I thought of Sarah herself for a dispassionate moment and somehow fifteen minutes vanished between two ticks of a wall clock I could hear above my head . I started rather violently and checked my pockets to see if a sympathetic pickpocket had lightened the load of a clearly weary man . I was still in one piece and , feeling better for the few moments of unconsciousness , I left the hotel . 17 THOMAS VALIER 6:40 P.M. I suspect that there is scarcely an hour of the day on any day of the week that somewhere a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , and lavish buffet .  | And with enough guests imperfectly known to those in charge , it becomes possible for anyone to enter provided only that he maintain an air of cheerful self-possession and wave , now and then , to people at the other end of the room . I am sure there are some people who manage to provide themselves with much of their food supply for the year by attending such parties  --  but , of course , at a price . There is the noise and the stale tobacco smoke and the crowds and the gradual accumulation of drunkenness and the indifferent food and having to watch , ad nauseam , people striving to maintain an image , make a contact or an impression , broach business , or stab an enemy . Generally , the price is too high for me , but I notice that when I do attend such a party , I become as bad as the rest . For all I know , every single person at any such party is convinced that he ( or she ) alone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be condemned as a phony or worse . I did n't have an invitation , but I had my ABA badge and , if questioned , I could prove my status as a writer , if not as a bookseller . However , I was n't questioned and I do n't think the fact that I was n't actually wearing my badge bothered anyone . Presumably , the publishing firm of Sewall , Broom and Company was investing its money in the hope of obtaining goodwill among the booksellers and any touch of nastiness in keeping out anybody , even if justified , would introduce an unpleasantness that would turn them all off . Better some wastage on party crashers than a negation of the entire purpose of the evening . The drinks were , of course , of no interest to me , and I passed them by except for a quick study to see if Henrietta was in view . She was n't . I had a horrible notion that if I did see her I would n't recognize her , for I could n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear her speak , though , I would have no trouble . My memory for hearing is much better than for seeing . I moved over to the buffet , which consisted largly of a mountain of fried chicken and was overcome by a feeling of dejd vu , of having done all that before . Except that it was n't the illusion one usually describes by that French expression , but the real thing . I had done all that before . The night before , I had  | stepped through a room with a bar , stopping only to look for someone , and then passing on to the buffet . Last night it had been Giles I had been looking for ; this night it was Henrietta . And as I had n't seen him last night , I did n't see her this night . I concentrated moodily on the fried chicken . It looked and smelled good and my appetite was with me in a bound . ( I may get too upset to eat from time to time , but that state never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a healthy human being . ) I helped myself to a leg and a breast because I hate to have to pick and choose between white meat and dark meat , ladled on two or three sausages and some French fries . That , plus a salad and , later on , a cup of coffee and a sliver of cake , would represent all my inner man would need . After that , I could devote myself to finding Henrietta if she was there to be found . In moving about in search of an empty table , I passed the gantlet of a set of senior editors of Sewall , Broom , one of whom was a woman who headed a subsidiary house and whom I had known when that subsidiary house was an independent . I greeted them all with my head full of smiles and my hands full of food , managed to lean forward to kiss my friend without spilling anything , and got into the other room . The kiss meant my credentials for attending the party were full-blown and evident  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a bad firm . I would n't mind working with them , if I could be sure they would let me have my own way . Prism Press , at least , does n't interfere with me and that 's an advantage that balances out quite a bit of money . I suspect that thought passed through my mind because somewhere out of the corner of my eye , I became aware of Tom Valier , my esteemed publisher and the Prince of Prism Press . He saw me , too , more clearly than I saw him , for I had not as much as gotten one somber bite out of the chicken leg ( and remembered that I had had one for lunch , too ) when he joined me . " Hello , Darius . Terrible thing , " and he shook his head solemnly . I knew what he meant , of course . " Yes , terrible thing , " I said , and went on eating .  | He said , " You found the body , I heard . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell in the bathtub and killed himself ? " " That 's what it looked like , " I said . " Terrible thing , " he said . " Terrible . " He shook his head . " It happens all the time . Slipping in the bathtub , I mean . There must be thousands of people every year injured that way . The tub is a deadly weapon . Poor Giles . " " Terrible thing , " I said . " Terrible , " he said . Not for one minute did I think he had come just to tell me what a terrible thing Giles 's death was , and his indoctrination of me into the dangers of the bathtub interested me . I said , " Spying out the competition ? " " I 've got good friends at Sewall , Broom , " he said feebly , still brooding , apparently , over what a terrible thing it was . I finished my chicken leg and had a few French fries before tackling the salad . He said , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ? " " What we talked about yesterday ? " " About Giles leaving Prism Press ? " " Not leaving . He was talking about leaving . He had n't left yet . " He smiled in a deprecating way . " Under the circumstances , I do n't think we ought to mention that unnecessarily . The man 's dead , you know . " " Yes , I know . Terrible thing . " Tom looked suspicious , but I suppose the point he was making was too important to take off on side issues . " I mean , let the dead lie in peace . Why bother with useless scandal ? " " There 's no scandal in changing publishers , " I said . ( Maybe publishers thought there was , of course  --  if they were on the losing end . ) " Yes , but nothing came of it , you see , so why talk of it ? " " Sure , " I said . " I have no reason to talk about it , Tom . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And as though I had relieved him enough to make it possible for him to think of food , he said , " I think I 'll get something for myself . " He came back a few minutes later with chicken on his own plate and by then I had had a chance to think a little . " We 've got to look at the bright side , Tom , " I said . " His book will do better than ever . It 's not every author who dies in the middle of a promotion campaign . " " Oh , no , " he said uneasily , " we do n't want to capitalize on a thing like this . " " Why not ? What about the signed books you were going to hand out as door prizes ? Are they all gone ? " He frowned and looked shocked , as though deploring my bad taste . " Oh , no . I 've got them . We ca n't hand them out now . It would n't be a fit thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If you hang on to them till Evergone is a clear best seller , you can auction them off . I would n't be surprised , considering these are the last autographs anyone will get , if they do n't bring a couple of hundred apiece . " " No , " he said , " I do n't even want to think of anything like that . " ( But he was thinking of it , I knew , and I bet myself five to two he would do it eventually . ) " Come on , " I said , " take advantage of the headlines . It 's happened at the ABA Convention . It would mean a lot to the booksellers and they 'll push the book . You know , Death at the ABA . " ' For a minute , I recalled Asimov 's cri de coeur of the night before ; of his obligation to write a book called Murder at the ABA . I swear to you I was so desperate to make sense out of the whole thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing in order to have his plot  --  or publicize his book. *  | Tom said reluctantly , " I suppose sales will improve , but I do n't care about that . " The comers of my mouth quirked a bit at that thoroughly ridiculous statement that no publisher ( certainly not Tom ) could possibly have said without instantly making himself a liar . I held steady though and said , " For that matter , you can jack up the price for movie rights to Evergone , and you can bring out Giles 's first novel again at a higher price and probably sell as many copies as you sold the first time , if not more . The cloud has a silver lining , literally . " " Oh , well , " said Tom . " It 's not an appropriate subject for discussion . The loss of those books he might have written ca n't be made up for . " And he filled his mouth with chicken . We both ate quietly and I went for my coffee and cake , being thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books that Giles " might have written " would n't have been Prism Press books . It was no loss to Tom . He only gained . Could he have done it ? There was the anger over Giles 's leaving the house and frustration over the financial loss that might represent ; and add to that the gains his death would bring . Was it guilt that made him urge me to say nothing of his troubles with Giles , to hide the motive ? Was it guilt that made him steadfastly refuse to accept the bait of greed I dangled before him , to hide the motive ? Was that why he talked so prattlingly of accidental deaths in the bathtub ? Was he anxious to make sure that there was no hint of murder in the air ? But it was all conjecture . He might really think it was accident ; he might really be embarrassed at seeming to profit out of tragedy . If Eunice were there , and if she read my thoughts , as seemed to be  | her habit , she could probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons . Oh , well . I changed the subject . " Have you seen Henrietta , I wonder ? " Tom registered polite inquiry . " Henrietta ? " " The interview secretary of the ABA . Plump girl . Longish face . " Tom shook his head . " I 'm afraid I do n't know her . Teresa might . She arranged the autograph session along with the Hercules Books people . The Devore autograph session , " he explained , and his voice dropped as he said it as though he had just placed a phantom hat over this heart . " I suppose Teresa would have had to have some contact with the interview secretary . " " Sounds reasonable . Where 's Teresa ? " " She went home . She developed a sick headache after hearing about Giles . " Well , if Tom was a Macbeth , Teresa was no Lady Macbeth . That is , provided she really did go home with a sick headache ( God , I was beginning to suspect everything ) . " I wo n't be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let the girls run the booth . This thing with Giles has spoiled the convention for me . " " Terrible thing , " I agreed , and eventually he got up and left . Eventually I got up , too , to find Henrietta , if she was there . 18 HENRIETTA CORVASS 7:4.5 P.M. The party was crowded , filling two large rooms , with a corridor in between . It was not as though the people were stationary and I could simply go from group to group , studying the faces . They were moving around , brushing past me , shifting and changing . Nor was it as though I were invisible and could carry on my errand undisturbed . I knew perhaps one out of ten people there and each one , it seemed to me , hailed me . I was a celebrity , getting more mileage out of the fact that I had found the body than out of all four ( and a fifth in press ) of my books put together . There was n't , as far as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what might have been expected if all were well ; there was no trace of solemnity over and above that which might have resulted from a momentary difficulty in getting to the bar , or from a conversation that might have come to rest , for a while , on the matter of the loss of a job , of a book , of a buck . Life goes on . Here was the case of a man who , some nine hours before , had been one of the stars of the convention . And , some six or seven hours before , he had met with death , violent and unexpected . It was a pity , it was a shame , it was a shock , it was terrible , and then life went on . Giles was swallowed up by the inexorable advance of time and it was as though he had never been . Here 's to the next man who dies . And if it had been someone else who found the body ; if I had been in no way involved ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; would I have been any different ? I did n't have to make any bets with myself . It was a dead certainty that I would have been no different . Life goes on . If every human being on earth were to die in one gory moment , whatever else of life on the planet was left would go on , unconcerned , and nothing else in the entire universe would give a damn . Nor should they ? The universe goes on . I was getting more and more morbid as I went from group to group , being engaged at times and disengaging myself at times , and coming to the decision that the needle I was hunting for was n't there , and thinking I would see her tomorrow anyway And then , about a quarter to eight , I heard her voice . I did n't see her at first . I turned in the direction of her voice and , with that as guide , I recognized her at once . I joined the group quietly and listened , trying to work myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract her from the group and I did n't want to do it very ostentatiously . Being unobtrusive is easier for me than for most . I do n't take up much room , and I 'm not one of those noticeable characters , either for reasons of sheer bulk as Giles had been or out of a visible glow of selfsatisfaction as Asimov is . When I had been standing there long enough to be taken for  | granted I managed to lock eyes with Henrietta . Recognition on her part was instantaneous , but after a second or two , she looked away quite deliberately . I nudged my way next to her and tapped her very lightly on the elbow . When she turned , I said , " I want to talk to you . " I mouthed it so that I practically made no sound . She said , " Why ? " talking normally . I said , still quite low , " It 's important . " " About ? " She did n't finish the phrase , not because I interrupted her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to finish it and that gap in sound was as clear an ending to the phrase as a word would have been . " Yes . " " Ca n't it wait ? " She was looking angry . " Please , " I said . She looked rapidly from face to face as though hoping for some sort of rescue , but her momentary withdrawal from the general conversation meant , merely , that it flowed past and over her and it was as though she were not there at all . So she said crossly , " Well ? " " Not here . Please . Come with me . " I 've felt reluctant arms in my time . I 've led girls in directions they were not sure they wanted to go . Generally , I expected to be able to change their minds and make them glad they had come along . This time it was different . Henrietta 's arm felt stiff and unyielding and I did n't have the self-assurance of delights to come to lend me plausibility . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Just outside . Five steps outside , " I said urgently . " No more . " She came with me . It was the darker half of twilight outside , with the sky slate gray , and the air motionless and mild . The traffic was gaudy in its headlights and taillights . The street was wide , not too full of people , and there was a hip-high wall of concrete about the building in which the restaurant was . Through a break in the wall there was a wide , shallow stairway that led down to a sunken patio .  | It had been my notion to go down to the patio , but it carried an overflow of people from the party at the small tables there , so I motioned her , instead , to sit down on the wall . I placed my hands on it and lifted myself up to sit on it with my feet dangling . She said , " That was a terrible thing . Talk about the wrong kind of publicity ! It will be in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henrietta . The hotel will do its best to keep it quiet , and what is there to a guy falling in the tub ? He 's not exactly a household word . He might become one after this , but he is n't yet . " I was trying to soothe her , loosen her up . I swung my feet and grew chattier . " You know , " I said , " when the movie actor James Dean died in a road accident about twenty years ago , he got exactly two inches in the newspapers . I noticed it at the time because I had seen him on a TV show and had admired him . Then his final movies came out , and he became a soaring teen-age idol . If , two years after his death , he could have come back to life and died again , there 'd have been no type large enough for any newspaper in the United States to announce the fact . It might be that way with Giles two years from now , but right now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the one who had to make the announcement . " " It 's your job . " " It does n't mean I have to like it . " " All right , do n't like it . What you 're doing is disliking me , just because I brought the news to you . I do n't like it , either . How 'd you have liked to have been there and ? ' " Shut upl " Rather to my surprise , she seemed on the point of tears . I did shut up , and waited till I saw whether she was going to tip toward tears or dry eyes . It was the latter and she said , " What are we doing out here ? " I said , " Look , he was a friend of mine . You were there last night and he did n't want to go with you , remember ? I made him go , and because I did , he could n't pick up a package he wanted to pick up and he asked me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to do it . It 's important to me , now , to make sure that my failure  | with that package did n't lead to his death . This could mean a lot to me. just remember that I 'm stuck with my misery now because I did you a favor last night . I 'm trying to find out as much about this whole thing as I can , now , and you can return the favor and help me . " She was n't buying it , though I was using my most sincere and insinuating tone of voice . She said , " How could the package mean anything one way or the other ? " I shrugged . " They were pens . He always used monogrammed pens and he had left his supply home . I did n't get them to him , so he autographed books with the one pen he had and it ran out of ink and that upset him . If he had n't been upset he might have gone to the book-and-author lunch afterward . Since he was upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided to take a shower and cool off and , I suppose , fell . So that makes it all my fault in a way . " " If that 's the way it was , what can I do about it ? " " You can help me show myself that I 'm wrong ; that there may have been some other reason he went up to his room , some other reason he was upset , some other reason he slipped . I do n't want to have to think I helped kill my friend , if I can avoid it . And you can help me . " " But how ? " " I just want to know everything that happened after the last time I saw him alive last night , and you walked off with him . " When she hesitated , I said , " I 'm not a policeman , Henrietta . I ca n't make you tell me . I 'm just asking you to tell me out of common humanity . " " But there 's nothing to tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . " " How did you go ? Where ? Who did the taping ? " " We went by taxi . We picked one up just outside the hotel and it took us to the studio . It was a morning talk show with what'sher-name . " She waved one hand in the air . " Sandra someone . " ( I knew whom she meant . ) " We taped it and that 's all . " " Did you have to wait long before you started ? "  | " Five or ten minutes . You know how it is . They always make you wait just so that you know who 's boss . " " How did Giles take that ? " " He just sat there , looking straight ahead , puffing out his mustache . I was a little nervous because I had insisted he come , and once or twice he looked at his watch and then at me , but he did n't say a word . " " And how did he behave during the taping ? " " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're going to run it in about three weeks to fit in with publication day . If they have any brains , they 'll push it ahead now . I would n't be surprised , " she added bitterly , " if they run it tomorrow morning while the convention is still on . " " Not a chance , " I said soothingly . " They have commitments , too . What did they talk about ? " " About what you 'd expect . She wanted to know about his book and what it was about and whether there would be a movie sale . Then she got onto his writing habits . Since he had said the book dealt partly with the Watergate crisis , she asked whether he did n't think there were fantasy aspects to that . He said surrealism ' was the word he would use and explained what he meant . He was very good . It was a good show . " " I 'll have to watch , " I said . " Did she ask about his publishers ? Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Henrietta sounded surprised . " Should she have ? " " I do n't know , " I said ingenuously . " I 'm just asking because Prism Press are my publishers , too , and I was wondering if they got any of the publicity . " " Oh , sure . When they mentioned the name of the book at the beginning and end of the program , they mentioned the publisher , too . " " At no other time ? Nothing else ? " " Nothing that I can remember . " " And what happened after the taping was over ? " " Nothing . We went back . " It was quite dark by then and I could n't see her face clearly in the streetlights . Her voice , however , had gone dead .  | I said , " After you took him to his room , I mean . " Her voice gained a sudden edge . " Why do you say I took him to his room ? " " You were going to , were n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that you would see him safely back to his room . " " Oh , I see what you mean , " she said , with a sudden air of indifference as though it all meant very little . " I went up the elevator with him to his floor . " It would have been utterly unconvincing in any case , but now that I had talked to Eunice , I knew exactly where we stood and she did n't have a chance with me . " Of course , " I said , " he asked you into his room . " " No-o-o , " she said feebly . " Henrietta , " I said , " be reasonable . He asks every woman into his room . " ( I did n't know that for a fact , but I felt absolutely safe . ) " And you must have gone in , or you would n't be in this state . " She did n't answer and she turned her head away . I 'm sure she had started to cry . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . You do n't have to go into any details . just let me know , roughly , what went on . " She looked about to see if there was anyone near us . There was n't . There 's a kind of freemasonry of humanity that keeps anyone not completely outside the pale from coming too near any man and woman engaged in what seems an intimate conversation . She said , " There 's nothing I have to be ashamed of , but it 's all so unpleasant . " I said , " Henrietta , I know Giles better than you think . I have an idea of what he is capable of . He did n't  --  hurt you ? " ( Even though I was doing my best to use words that would keep her calm , it hurt me to use that Victorian pause followed by that Victorian euphemism . ) " Oh , he did n't , " she said , grateful for the euphemism , I 'm sure . " He just asked me to come in and tuck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after the taping was over that now I  | would take him right back to the hotel as I had promised and tuck him in . " I laughed , because I thought he was joking , too , and said that I hoped he would have a good night 's sleep . But he took my wrist in his hand and said , Oh , come on in for a while . ' Well , I did n't like to make a scene and I could n't believe he had anything really ? you know ? " She paused in confusion . I said , " You did n't expect him to try to use force on you , you mean ? " " Well , I thought he might try to persuade me to come to bed with him " ? she was suddenly more businesslike , as though she felt it to be beneath her dignity to be caught being too coy ? " but I had no doubt he would n't succeed . He did n't appeal to me at all and I have a lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled in and the door closed behind me and then I said as coldly as I could , Really , I have work to do , Mr. Devote , ' and his voice changed . " " His voice changed ? " " It became high-pitched and squeaky ? Do I have to go on ? " " I wish you would . Please . Just roughly . You do n't have to give me every word . " " He wanted me to undress him . He called me Mommy . " " What did you do ? Undress him ? " " I did n't know what to do . I did n't want to start screaming ; I did n't want to create a stupid scandal . I thought I 'd humor him a little and perhaps calm him down . I mean , I 'm not a virgin and I 'm not afraid of men . I took off his jacket , his tie , his shirt , and I helped him off with his shoes and socks . But that was as far as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted me to bathe him . I mean , he said , Bathe me , Mommy , ' and that was just too much . I just dashed for the door and out . " " He did n't try to stop you ? " " No . He just cried . After I closed the door , I could hear him crying inside , like a little boy . So I went down to the bar and I had a couple of drinks and , thank God , I did n't meet anyone I knew . Then I went to my room and took a sleeping pill . " I waited a while to let her recover , then I said , " When you took  | off his clothes  --  those items of clothing you did take off , that is  - -  what did you do with them ? " " Oh , that ! That was another weird thing . He directed me . He made me put the shoes in the closet with the points inward . He made me hang up his jacket with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt in some very careful way . " " a whiny sort of way . So I did it  --  I told you I was trying to keep him under control . He wanted me to blow in his socks before folding them . That I would n't do and he got petulant and said he wanted to be bathed and I ran . " That was it , then . I had what I wanted . As late as last night , he still insisted on having his clothes folded . Henrietta said , breaking in on my thoughts , " So you have what you wanted . " " What ? " I looked up quickly . Was another one reading my mind ? " It was over me that he was upset , not over the missing pens . " " Are you guessing that or did he tell you that this morning ? " She got down from her seat on the wall . " Oh no , I did n't see him this morning . After I left him last night , I never saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I got up this morning , I had breakfast in my room , and I called down at five after nine and told them I would n't be in till after ten . He would be autographing then and there would be no chance of running into him . " " Then you were n't at the autographing session ? " " Certainly not ! " " Did n't someone go for him in the morning ? " " I would n't know , but it was n't I. I was through squiring him around . " Yet I had the distinct impression there had been a woman with him in the morning before ten . Someone had told me so . There was even a name given me . . . . No use , I drew a blank . I said , " Look , Henrietta , do n't start thinking it was over you that all this happened . It could have been something else alto-  | gether . Did Giles say anything at all to you last night that indicated he was disturbed about anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it for a while . Did anything happen out of the ordinary ? Were you stopped by anyone at any time ? Did someone speak to Giles ? Did Giles say something puzzling ? Did he look funny at any time I mean , not with respect to his sex games . Is there anything , as you think back on last night , that puzzled you at the time ? " She said , " Not a thingl Nothingl " Well , I had to accept it . I could n't beat her into remembering . And at that point , even if there was something to remember , I suspected that she would n't  --  just to be done with it all . In fact , I did n't think I could keep Henrietta there much longer . She showed distinct signs of getting ready to leave . I said hastily , " When did you leave him last night ? " " I did n't look at my watch . It felt something like elevenish , but I do n't know . Look , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know  --  it 's confidential . " " Absolutely . And thank you . " She turned and hurried down the steps , and I turned in another direction and walked down the street toward the hotel . 19 SHIRLEY JENNIFER 9:10 P.M. What was I to do next ? I knew what Giles had done up to possibly 11 P.M. the night before . At 10 A.M. he was autographing . Nobody had said he was late and it would have been remarked on if he were . What had happened in those eleven hours of night and morning that might account for what happened toward noon ? There was a woman with him toward the end of the period . Of that I was certain even if I could n't remember what it was that made me certain . The question was : Who was she and had she been with him all night ? I tried to put myself in Giles 's place . As long as he was with Henrietta and he was engaged in his game , it would surely never have occurred to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package and key were not there . Once she left , did he find another woman with whom to continue the game and was it not till morning that he noticed the lack ? Or did he go to sleep in frustration after Henrietta left , too much the little boy of his sexual fantasies to notice ? Or was it that he did notice but thought the cloakroom was closed after eleven and was he too frustrated and too little-boy to do anything about it ? As usual , when I asked myself a series of questions such as these , I had no answer . I was entering the lobby of the hotel when I heard the cry that I suppose I had been dreading , subconsciously , ever since lunch . " Dari-i-ius , I 've been looking for you all da-a-a-ay . " I do n't think she had , but it was the nice thing to say . " Hello , Shirley , " I said dully . " I 'm sorry . I 've had a terrible day . " " I kno-o-ow . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be the one to find it . I suppose that was the reason you never came to my booth when I was signing . " She picked that moment to light a cigarette . She knows I hate it and I decided that despite her claim to understanding she was getting back at me for standing her up . I said defensively , " I was spending the time with the cops , and it was no fun . " " Poor baby , " she purred . It was odd how remote and immune I felt . I said , " I feel pretty sick about it and I guess I 'll go home and give myself a chance to recover . " I backed away a little . She looked surprised and a little annoyed . " Home ? " One minute before , I had had no intention of leaving just yet , but now it seemed.the thing to do . I could think of no other way of avoiding another night with Shirley , and I had to avoid it . Perhaps after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , not while I was so aware that if it had n't been for the night before , I would n't have been the one to discover Giles 's body . If I think about it now , I do n't see much sense in my attitude , but at the time it was different . It made more sense to me than anything else that had happened the entire day . " I better do that , Shirley . I 'm wom out with the afternoon I 've  | had . " I managed a yawn , and suddenly found it was n't difficult . " Will you be here tomorrow ? " She looked indifferent . " I do n't know . " " I 'll be here . Maybe I 'll see you . " And I about-faced and walked out of the hotel . Ten hours earlier , I would have been willing to bet a hundred to eight  --  more  --  that I would spend another night with Shirley , but even very short odds win on occasion . Now I made a bet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd never speak to me again . I wo n't lie to you . I was sorry about that ; damned song . I walked home . It was a healthy walk to the park and then along its long side , but I was n't in a hurry to try to make it to bed . I kept thinking , with my mind going around in the same circles and ending nowhere . When I found myself in my apartment with the door locks clicked shut behind me ( all three of them ) and with my typewriter gazing reproachfully at me through the door to the bedroom ( as it always seems to do when it is neatly covered and has been unused for longer than two days ) , I could n't remember the walk from the hotel at all . It was a more-than-a-mile walk and I could n't remember a step of it . My passage from hotel to apartment might have been by instantaneous mass transference , like something out of Asimov 's silly science fiction stories. * It was only about 10:30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | yet I did not want to stay awake . I went through the preparations for bed , washing my teeth and all the rest of it , half in the hope that it would wake me , but it did n't . Of course , it was possible that , going to bed early , I might wake up at 3 A.M. with all my sleep done . I thought of Henrietta taking a sleeping pill , and while I disapprove of that , I would have taken one if there had been such a thing in the house . I put out the light , got into bed , and left the window open so I could hear the hypnotic sounds of traffic and city life seeping upward from twelve floors below . ( It 's hypnotic to those bred in the city , that is . ) Just before I went to sleep , there was one last thought I had . Isaac Asimov had been the second author at the autographing session . He might have seen Giles come in with somebody . What 's more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? 11 A.M. , I thought  --  I 'd look it up in the moming  --  it was something I had thought  --  might be in  --  teresting  --  anyway And I slept .  | But I did n't sleep really well . I had bad dreams of which I do n't remember the details . Though I did n't wake up at three , I did flip my eyes open at six and found I had a rotten taste in my mouth and that my head was resting on a pillow damp with perspiration . I stared at the ceiling for a while , sorting out the nightmares my imagination had constructed from the nightmare of yesterday 's realities , and decided I was n't going to be able to sleep any more that morning . So I pushed out of bed , took care of my day 's assurance that I would require no laxatives , showered , shaved , and then had to make the decision about breakfast . The contrast with the breakfast of the morning before was too extreme , and I decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . I did n't even want to be alone . It was a bright morning , the temperature was 59 and that would mean comfortable walking in a jacket , so I walked to the hotel . Actually , I jogged partway since I was feeling guilty over having stayed out of the gym for the length of the convention . The coffee shop at the hotel was respectably full even though I was there by 7:30 A.M. , and after I had ordered my pancakes and ham ( no use getting something I could make for myself at home  --  and I never made pancakes ) I listened to the conversation about me . Muhammad Ali , it seems , was the big hit of the convention . He had been big and brash , and I suspect there is something exciting to the audience in seeing a man who could flatten you into a grease spot with one blow if he wanted to exert himself  --  something like being in the same room with a tame lion and with no bars in between . I also heard comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , too , pushing the biography she had written of her son . A bookseller ( I caught just enough of his badge to see he was from Dallas ) complained that no editor or publisher ever came to his store , so how could they know the problems of the bookseller ?  | And the salesmen , he said , just wanted to unload books and did n't care if the store went broke . I took a circuitous route on my way out after I had finished , deliberately attempting to overhear conversations . There were complaints about the discounts on textbooks ( not high enough ) , on the nature of the packages the books came in ( not easy enough to open ) , on the quality of the books that came in ( not undamaged enough ) , and loud bitching about the Postal Service ( not anything enough ) . At one table , there was a discussion of the relative merits of religious books and occult books and how both were selling well , and I had a momentary impulse to lean over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just to stir something up , but did n't . It was n't my business , after all . I heard only one comment from the other end of the spectrum , which is n't surprising , since most of the attendees at the ABA were booksellers , after all . There must , however , have been two editors talking in the corner , for one was complaining that booksellers by and large did n't read books and how could they sell what they were not interested in ? I was n't just being a nosybody , you understand . I was curious as to the extent to which Giles 's death had taken over the convention . The answer was simple . Zero , that was the extent . I caught exactly one comment that was Giles-oriented . A fellow from Poughkeepsie said , " Someone fell and killed himself in the shower yesterday . Hear about that ? " He could n't even use his name . The answer was , " What I say is , do n't take showers . A cousin of mine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to hear . Life goes on . 2 SARAH VOSKOVEK 8:45 A.M. It was about a quarter to nine when I went to the elevator and punched the " up " button . I doubted that the hotel chief of security would be at his desk yet , and in any case I did n't know where his desk was . I did know where Sarah was , so I went up to the  | sixth floor . Undoubtedly she was n't in yet , but I would wait a reasonable length of time . I was wrong ; she was in . The girl at the outer desk still was n't there , but I could see Sarah in the inner room . I knocked on the doorjamb and said , " Hello . " She turned , saw me , and said , " Come in . " She did n't smile ; somehow I felt smiling did n't come easy to her , but she did n't frown , either . She was wearing a dark-green outfit in which the collar stood up behind ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to learn them ) . It was cut narrow and low in front , just low enough to show a pleasant cleavage between breasts of light cream . It was a pleasant sight for the morning . She said , " How are you , Darius ? You look a little worn . " " Bad day followed by bad night . It 's all right . " She changed her cool expression into one of quiet sympathy . " It 's Mr. Devore 's death , of course . " " Yes . " " If I had not come to see you at the luncheon ? " " What 's the difference ? I was about due to remember , and something else would have kicked it off if you had n't . " She said , " You know , the Medical Examiner came at about seven-thirty last night and took the body away . " " I assumed he did it at some time in the evening . What happened to Eunice ? I mean , Mrs. Devore ? " " That I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to get you coffee ? " " No , I 've just had some . ' What I 'd really like to do is to get , say , six hours of rest in which my brain was turned on to nothing but rest  --  preferably in your arms . " ' Why I said it , I do n't know , because she did n't appeal to me , but when you reach middle age and have as checkered a career with women as I have had , these things come out without real planning  --  like slicing bread . Even as I heard myself say it , I expected her to turn icy , but she did n't . Rather shockingly , she smiled and sat back in her chair . " Well , " she said , " do n't do anything that will get me fired . "  | She caught me by surprise and the moment passed . Her muscles tightened and she was sitting up in her chair once more , her posture excellent . " But is there anything in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " When does the chief of security come in ? His name is even harder than yours or I 'd call him by that . " She looked at her watch . " It is Marsogliani . " ( She pronounced it " Mahr-soh-LYAH-nee , " which is how I tried to say it afterward . ) " He 's usually quite early , but I do n't know if he 's arrived . And if he has arrived , he may not be at his desk . Is it that you want to see him ? " she asked , lapsing into non-English word order , which just made her sound cuter . " Quite a lot , " I said . She shrugged . " I 'll call him for you , but you know , he was a little annoyed with you yesterday . " " Did he tell you why ? " " He said you were a busybody . No details . " " I am a busybody , " I said . " At least right now I am . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Depends . " " Is there a drug problem at the hotel ? " " Drug problem ? " " I mean , is the hotel involved in some way in the sale or distribution of drugs  --  dope  --  heroin ? " " Certainly not ! " " All right . Not the hotel . But is it taking place here without the hotel 's connivance ? That 's what I mean . " She stared at me thoughtfully . " Why are you asking this ? " " I said I 'm a busybody . " " You are , indeed . It 's not your business to ask a question like that , nor is it mine to answer . If you must ask , you will have to ask Mr. Marsogliani , but I do n't see why he should answer you , either . " " Would you call him ? " She did . He answered . At least I suppose he answered , since she talked as though he were on the phone . She explained that I  | wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " He only wishes to see you for a moment . " She had to guess that , for it was not derived from anything I had said . I got the impression he would n't have agreed to see me if I had n't been working through Sarah . Chalk up one good decision for me in seeing her first , and one good turn from the little woman . " Thanks , Sarah , " I said . " I would n't want to do anything to make you lose your job , but it requires restraint on my part . " She smiled a little . Just as I was walking out , the receptionist walked in . She moved behind the desk in the outer office , put down her purse , and looked at me and then at Sarah with a kind of wise tolerance in her eyes . She was a good-looking black woman , about thirty , I should say . I lifted both hands as though surrendering . " Business , " I said . " Strictly business . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it weren't. 3 ANTHONY MARSOGLIANI 9:20 P.M. Marsogliani was n't smiling when I reached his office , which was also on the sixth floor . He made me wait while he went over some papers leisurely , making it perfectly clear he was n't rushing . I sat there , my mind detached , prepared to show no signs of impatience but letting my eyes follow him in all his movements . He was n't smoking a cigar but he smelled of stale cigar smoke just the same . I guess he always did . And he looked about the way he smelled , sour and uninviting . It was well after nine when he finally wore himself out at the game of doing nothing under my unswerving gaze and said , " What can I do for you ? " I said , " Would you be able to find out for me whether anything in Mr. Devore 's autopsy shows him to have been a user of drugs ? " " No , " he said . " Call the police or ask his wife . Anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't tell me and it would be rather rough  | bothering his wife on such a subject at such a time . Why ca n't you tell me ? " " The police wo n't tell me , either . It 's none of my business . " " Is n't it ? There was heroin in the hotel room . " " I did n't see any . " " It was there . Someone brushed it away . " He reddened very slightly . " Who is the someone ? Me ? " " I 'm not accusing anyone , but it was there , and after a while it was n't there . It seems to me important to know if it had anything to do with Devore . If he was not a drug user , then it may have been left over from the previous occupant of the room . " ( I did n't plan to say where I had gotten that notion ; I felt Marsogliani would n't welcome having his underling suggest such a thing to me and I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than Sarah 's . ) " Even if it was , so what ? " " So would it be an isolated incident ? Or is there a drug problem at the hotel ? " " I do n't know what you mean by a drug problem . " " I do n't know , either . Something that would make it undesirable to have anyone locate heroin in a hotel room . " " That would be undesirable at any time for any reason . " " If you found it , would you report it to the police ? " " Of course . " " Or is it something you would try to take care of quietly yourself , so that you would perhaps manage to avoid informing the police ? " Marsogliani looked at me for a long time from either side of his thick and majestic nose . Then he said , " These days there is the problem of drugs everywhere . It would be impossible not to have incidents in any hotel . Whether there is anything that could be called a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly tell the police , and I would certainly not tell you . " " You would n't , for instance , just quietly brush the heroin into an envelope and take it away ? " " No , I would n't , and I guess you 're lucky you 're such a little  | pipsqueak or , for suggesting it , I would pick you up , break you in two , and throw the pieces out of the office one at a time . " " I 'm glad I 'm small , then , " I said very politely , and stood up . " One minute , " he said . " What 's your name again ? " " Darius Just , " I said . " Mr. Just , I suppose all this is because you still think that the man in i 511 was murdered . Have you given your theory to the police ? " " No . After the reaction I received from you , I felt I had better dig up stronger grounds . " " I see . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Either the man in 1511 was not murdered or he was . If he was not murdered , your investigations will come to nothing , but they are likely to be a pain in the neck to the hotel and I may eventually find myself unable to resist unscrewing your head . If he was murdered , then your unauthorized and clumsy investigations may encourage whoever murdered him to try to do the same to you just to get rid of an annoyance . Think it over . " " Either way , I 'm not long for this world then ? " " Think it over  --  but do it outside . " He reached for a cigar and put it into his mouth and that was hint enough for me . I dislike cigarette smoke , but I detest cigars with a passion . So I walked out , having accomplished nothing . Before speaking to Marsogliani , I was reasonably sure that he had brushed away the heroin , and if so , it was to protect the hotel . Having spoken to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase my certainty . Status quo. 4 SARAH VOSKOVEK 9:35 A.M. I leaned against the wall outside Marsogliani 's office , thinking it out for a while and getting nowhere . I looked at my watch , found it a bit past nine-thirty , leaving me an hour and a half before the panel I wanted to attend . What to do ? I did n't have a room in the hotel , so I could n't go there and stare out the window . The exhibit booths would be opening at ten , but there was nothing I wanted there .  | I walked down the sixth floor toward the elevators , feeling very much the complete failure . There was the glass door that led to Room 622 on my right , but I had no excuse to go in there , or anything useful to do once I was in . The matter was taken out of my hands . Sarah was standing there , her spike heels bringing her eyes nearly to a level with mine . She said , " Mr. Marsogliani just called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for any purpose . I imagined you 'd be coming down the hall therefore , and I hoped in reasonable health . He sounded furious . " " He was slightly furious . He did n't hit me because I 'm so little . " " There are advantages to it , then . " It was about what I had said to Marsogliani , but what I say and what other people are allowed to say are two different things . I said , " Thanks , " rather angrily . She looked at me speculatively ; the kind of look , I think , that I give to some girls . She said , " If there were even one person in the world who despised you for your height as much as you yourself do , you would then have reason for complaint . " " Two nights ago , " I said , " you ? " " Ah , " she said , clasping her hands , " but I have apologized . That is not kind . " " You 're right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize . " I felt so gentlemanly that , if I had had a hat , I would have tipped it . As it was , I raised two fingers of my right hand and made an outward gesture at eye level . I turned away . " But wait , " she said . " I want to talk to you . " I turned again , expectantly . She added , " If you have the time . " I looked at my watch automatically , though I knew the time . " I have some time , " I said . She said , " There is a room I can use sometimes . Would you come to it with me ? Here we will be interrupted . I 'm expecting the art director . " " Wo n't he leave if you 're not here ? " Her lips set dangerously . " He will not . He will wait for me. "  | She leaned back , past the doorway , and said to her receptionist , " Ginger , if anyone comes for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be back soon .... Will you come to the room , Darius ? " It seemed only natural , almost inevitable , to grin , look knowing , and hope that the room had a bed in it . But I did n't say a thing . The trouble was that I never saw a woman look so  --  no , not innocent , I was quite sure there was nothing innocent about her in the old-fashioned sense and had n't been for some years  --  well , so divorced from seduction . " Gladly , " I said , and there was no seductiveness in that , either . We went up the elevator to the tenth floor . Others got in the elevator and she moved away and let them separate us . She did not look at me  --  or look away from me , either . She met my eye , occasionally , and without any particular interest whenever chance would have it so . She was a woman loaded with common sense . I felt myself liking her more per inch than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the total liking very high , unfortunately . She stepped off at the tenth floor , certain that I would follow , and I did . A third person stepped off , a youngish man , but he turned in the other direction . He was n't wearing a convention badge . She opened the door to a room quickly , and I followed her in just as quickly . She placed the " Do Not Disturb " sign outside and closed the door . I said , " What will they think when they see that sign ? " nodding in its direction . She said , " Let them think what they will think . " She sat down . " This is a staff room . There are several of them . They are useful when a member of the staff must stay overnight , or does not feel well and wishes to lie down . In great emergencies they are rented , but ordinarily not  --  not even with a convention like this in the hotel . " " Very convenient and pleasant . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about drug problems . Is that what you asked Mr. Marsogliani , too ? "  | " You said I should . " " I said he was the person to ask . I did not think you would , or should . " " Well , I did . " " But why ? Why do you ask about the drugs ? " " Why should you want to know , Sarah ? " " So that I might give you information in exchange . " " That is the payment ; that is not the reason . Why should you wish to know ? " She said , " Because I 'm afraid you think Mr. Devore was murdered . " I paused and considered , but there was nothing to consider . I had n't the faintest idea whether it would serve my investigation ( or , perhaps , from its general failure to accomplish anything , I ought to give it the disgrace of quotation marks and call it an " investigation " ) to admit it or hide it . All things being equal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I 'm sure he was . " " Oh , for goodness ' sake , " she said , looking far more troubled than that miserably mild expletive would justify . " I know , " I said wearily . " It would be bad for the hotel . " " Yes , it could . I 'm thinking of Dr. Asimov and his book about murder at the ABA . " I had forgotten about that completely . " Oh , boy , " I said . " Have you told him ? " " No , I have n't , but if it 's murder , it will come out and then Asimov could use it if he wanted to . But do n't worry . I know him well enough to know that by the time he 's through prettying it up and translating it into his own milk-and-water style and changing all the characters to suit his own pseudo-romantic notions , no one would recognize the truth behind it . And I tell you what . I will personally guarantee that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints that would identify it . " " But that 's prior restraint , is n't it ? " She seemed in two minds as to whether to smile or not , and ended not smiling . " I 've changed my mind . Now , what are you going to tell me ? " " That the whole thing may be more complicated than you  | think . I scarcely like to say this . " Her voice had lowered , nervously . " If you think the room is bugged , " I said , " I 'll turn on the radio loud , and you can whisper in my ear . Or let 's go out somewhere . " " Oh , it 's not bugged . I just do n't like to say .... It 's so disgraceful and I 'm not supposed to know .... Darius . " " Yes ? " " Darius , there is a drug problem . I 've heard talk about it . " " Are you guessing ? Or is this hard information ? " " Not rock-hard , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as eleven to five ? " I said . ( I never gamble , actually , though I keep score in my own head of the bets I make with myself . I 'm about three hundred fifty dollars ahead , as of now . ) She said , " Better . Three to one at least . " She seemed to have no problem falling in with my betting game . " Okay . ' What 's the problem ? " " This may be a clearinghouse for drug distribution . " " Here ? " " Why not ? Thousands of people pass in and out . Anything can happen here anonymously . If Mr. Devore was killed , who could find the murderer in the crowd ? Who could identify anyone who went to his room ? Who would see such a thing ? Who would be interested ? There is scarcely anywhere as anonymous and safe from oversight as a huge hotel . " " So they could use it as a clearinghouse ? Someone gets the drug and someone distributes it here ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , then , why does n't the hotel report this to the police ? Or has it already done so ? " " I do n't think it has . The evidence , perhaps , is not clear , and Mr. Marsogliani ? " " ? wants to save the reputation of the hotel ? " Sarah shook her head . " That is not quite it . If he can gain more evidence and present the whole to the police , then not only is police involvement less long-drawn-out , but the hotel 's work can  | be praised . What was bad publicity could be made into less-bad publicity , even into almost-good publicity . " " And I 'm threatening to upset the whole scheme , just over a little thing like murder . " " You do n't really know that it 's murder , do you ? And suppose it were , how can you be sure it had a connection with the drug traffic ? " I said , " There was heroin in the room . " She looked shocked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure in the ordinary sense of the word . There was no time to analyze it , for it disappeared  --  and the disappearance is analysis enough for me . " " Was Mr. Devore a drug addict ? " " I 'm sure he was n't . I tried to get Marsogliani to check that for me , but not a chance . " " Even if he were not a drug addict , is it your theory that he might be part of the chain of distribution ? Would that explain his murder ? Is it that he was not behaving in such a way as to please the  --  please the ? " " Syndicate ? " " Yes , so they  --  they ? " " Rub him out ? " " Yes . Is that what you believe ? " " No , " I said  --  but that was n't quite true . Again someone was handing me something I had n't thought of and something that seemed disturbingly plausible . She said , " But if Mr. Devore were himself a drug pusher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole ring than to find one little small-time killer and allow the head men of the ring to escape ? Should n't you leave the investigation to professional people ? " " I do n't think professional people will accept the death as murder . " " But do n't you see that if he were killed and if drugs were involved , surely desperate people are involved , and you will be in danger if you get too near the truth ? "  | That sounded very much like Marsogliani 's warning , and the hell of it was that it made sense . And I 'm no hero . I said , in a troubled way ( for since I felt troubled , how else could I say it ? ) , " I 'm not out to get killed . I 'll be careful . " She smiled suddenly and said , " Good . Let Mr. Marsogliani handle it . He 'll know when to go to the police . " It seemed to me that she had reacted too quickly and too sunnily . Marsogliani had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this up as further pressure . It was all a game , with Sarah maneuvering me into cooperation by playing on my cowardice . What the devil made her so sure it was there to play on ? I said coldly , " I must go . I 'm catching a panel . " I left quickly . She must have been astonished at my sudden change in manner and my abrupt leave-taking , but it had occurred to me , further , that she chose that route to persuasion because she assumed that a small man was bound to feel fear of violence . Damn her ! And damn myself for feeling that fear ! 5 MICHAEL STRONG 10:40 A.M. I went down to the third floor and , in a mood of disconsolate anger , took my seat in an otherwise empty ballroom . It was nearly a quarter to eleven before the audience began to gather for the panel , which was called " Explaining the Unexplained . " There was some time to go , but I have a moderate experience with audiences and I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not come near to filling the room and it was quite clear that the interview room , which was in charge of these panels , would be mightily disappointed . It did n't matter to me . I was emotionally uninvolved . In the panel , that is , but not in Sarah Voskovek . I went over the previous conversation in my mind . There were the trappings of intrigue  --  the special room , not to be interrupted , the secret to be given away . It was a matter of atmosphere , was n't it , designed to play on my fears and shut me up . The more I went over it in my mind , the longer the odds grew in my private book that the attempt had been made to play me into the net of shut-up.  | And it bothered me because I had been starting to think that Sarah was a nice person . I was beginning to count on her , to rely on her for little things , like getting me an empty room or getting me in to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel myself flushing . " Mr. Just . " I looked up and blinked my eyes into focus . Michael Strong , the security guard , was standing in front of me . " Hello , " I said . " Off duty again ? " " Early lunch hour , " he said . " I want to hear the panel . " He added conversationally , " This is the most interesting convention we 've had during all my stay here at the hotel . May I sit with you , Mr. Just ? " " Why not ? " I said . " You 're not going to throw yourself out for not wearing a badge , are you ? " He laughed feebly , and sat down in the seat next to me . Considering the fact that there were several hundred unoccupied seats in the room , this anxiety of my company betokened either a strong personal affection for me or an order from his boss to keep an eye on me . I had told Sarah I was leaving to attend a panel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one  --  at this time . He had no difficulty finding me . Strong produced a yellow pad from his jacket pocket , then carefully chose a pen from the inner pocket in clear preparation for taking notes . He was going to play his cover well . I said , " How 's your boss ? " Strong turned a pair of wide eyes upon me . " In a foul mood , Mr. Just . " " About me , do you suppose ? " " I do n't know . Why do you think it 's about you ? " " I advanced a theory about that heroin . " " What heroin ? What are you talking about ? " He dropped his voice to a low whisper though there was no one within twenty-five feet of us . I did n't want to induce apoplexy in the poor fellow , so I lowered my voice , too . " I told Marsogliani , " I said , lying somewhat to see what would happen , " that I was pretty certain that the  | hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel themselves were involved and that was why he was n't reporting it . " I got what I wanted , for a look of what anyone would interpret as the purest astonishment crossed Strong 's face . That was it as far as Sarah was concerned in my book . Strong might be unbrilliant and he was certainly not a man in whom Marsogliani ( who , for all his temper , struck me as a fine-edged sharpie ) would confide . And I could see they had n't bothered telling him what the setup was with respect to me . But if there was no setup , if there really was a drug problem it was much more likely that Strong had heard the rumors than that Sarah had . So since Sarah reported it and Strong was clearly astonished out of his pants at what I had said , it was a setup . For once I was proud of my capacity for weaving a logical net . I said , " How long have you been working here as a guard , Mike ? " " Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phrase badly . " And in all that time you 've been aware of no such thing ? drugs and matters of that sort ? " " N-no , " he said earnestly , staring at me in horror . " You must have been crazy to say something like that to Mr. Marsogliani . " " Not if it 's true . " " But it is n't true . I 'm surprised he did n't kick your butt . " " I 'm too small a target . " Strong stared at me in continuing horror . " You have n't been talking like that to anyone else , have you ? " " Just Marsogliani this morning about nine A.M. and now you . " True enough . I had n't told it to Sarah . I had asked her and she had then told me . He said , " I would n't talk about that if I were you . " " Bad for the hotel ? " " Sure . Especially when it 's not true . " " Okay ! " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , abruptly and nervously , " You did n't tell Mr. Marsogliani that I said the powder might belong to a previous oc-  | cupant like as if " ? he faltered ? he as if it might be a common thing to have that stuff in the place . " 1 felt for him . It was quite clear to me ( odds a hundred to one at least ) that Marsogliani would kick Strong out of the hotel and into the middle of the street on his left ear if he knew of that little remark . I had no intention of losing the poor fellow his job ; finding another would be hard work in the Ford recession . So I said , truthfully and as earnestly as I could , " I did suggest that the powder might have been there all along , but I did n't say you had suggested that . I did n't say a word about you . Not a word . " He looked unconvinced , disturbed , and he stared at me as though he were trying to weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which I could help him convince himself I was an honest man . I would have to throw myself on the mercy of his , perhaps defective , judgment in such matters . 6 ISAAC ASIMOV 10:50 A.M. A new voice broke in and I looked up . It was Asimov , walking in some ten minutes early . He said , " Darius ! You 've come to hear me say my piece . I 'm touched . " I think he really was . Why else did he refrain from calling me Darius Dust and then choking himself red in the face on the wit of it ? However , fair 's fair . Since he gave up Darius Dust for that one time , I did n't let on that it was strictly an ulterior motive that had drawn me into the room . I said , " I can count on you to be interesting , Isaac . " Apparently that merely heightened his philanthropic mood ( which the clear absence of much of an audience did not seem to dampen ) and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why not ? " I said . I turned to Strong and said , " You 'll pardon me , I hope ? " He mumbled what I thought was an affirmative ( what else can  | anyone give under the circumstances ? ) and off I went . Later , when I looked back , I did n't see him . Clearly , he had left to report to Marsogliani on me . I was vaguely sorry I had had to upset him in my desire to double-check on the duplicity of Sarah Voskovek . Actually , the panelists were a rather impressive group . With an air of eager and cheerful proprietorship , Asimov introduced me to Carl Sagan , an astronomer at Cornell , tall and slim with dark hair and dark eyes and a quick way of speaking . Asimov introduced me as a " real writer , " a remark , I presume , designed to elicit assurance that he , too , was a real writer. * Sagan nodded amiably but I have a sure instinct for people who have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times was the moderator . He was even taller than Sagan , and thinner ; white-haired , ruddy of complexion , and so eager to please that when I was introduced as a writer , he said , " Oh , yes , " as though he read himself to sleep with me every night . I was nearly fooled . Asimov did n't know the other two personally , but they required no real introductions . One was Charles Berlitz , who had just written a book on the " Bermuda Triangle , " tall , round-faced , and gray-haired , and the other was Uri Geller , the Israeli semi-mystic who is supposed to bend keys by telekinesis , to read minds , and so on . Geller was young and very attractive both in appearance and in conversation . It was clearly Asimov and Sagan versus Berlitz and Geller , with Sullivan trying to remain impartial , but unable to resist toppling over onto the side of rationality . The panel discussion , however , lacked excitement . I do n't know whether the poor attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precognition of the lack of clash had kept the audience down . Either way , it was a quiet hour .  | Or most of it was . Toward the end , there was a challenge from the floor when someone dared Geller to subject himself to an audience of magicians , doing so in somewhat provocative language . Geller , who was used to this sort of thing , was careful not to betray himself into losing his temper . He simply stated that he would never do any demonstrations before magicians because it was useless to do so ; they would never believe anything he did was anything but trickery , no matter what the circumstances . That seemed to stir Asimov . He leaned over to whisper something to Sullivan and was duly recognized . " I do not think , " he said , " that the problem of the refusal-tobelieve on the part of magicians is a serious one . It is paralleled by a far greater , far greater , and far more intense refusal-to-disbelieve on the part of almost everybody else . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this applies to him , for it is true of anyone who invades the area lying outside the narrow and constricted boundaries of what scentists will , without serious argument , accept . " The parascientific fringes are intrinsically glamorous , they are exciting and delightful , and they court belief . Millions will grant the belief and will not be deterred by anything scientists will say , especially since scientists can not counter with anything equally evocative but can only grumble a spoilsport It is n't so ! ' " In fact , so eager are people to believe the essentially incredible that they will resent , even with violence , any effort to advance evidence in favor of disbelief . If some mystic , with a wide and ardent following , were to disown all his previous statements , if he were to declare his miracles frauds , and his beliefs charlatanry , he would lose scarcely a disciple , since one and all would say he had made his statements under compulsion or under a sudden stroke of lunacy . The world will believe anything a mystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fakery . They actively refuse to disbelieve . " Is there , therefore , anything to be accomplished by arguing against mystics , or by trying to analyze their beliefs rationally ? As a healthful exercise to improve and strengthen one 's own rationality , certainly . As a hope to reform fools , never .  | " But it does n't matter . My own attitude is to bid the world , believe ! All of you  --  believe ! Believe whatever you want , for in doing so , whatever misery you bring upon yourself and others , you will nevertheless never affect reality . Though all earth 's four billion swear from top to bottom and left to right that the earth is flat and though they kill anyone who dares suspect it might be an oblate spheroid with a few minor irregularities , the earth will nevertheless remain an oblate spheroid with a few minor irregularities . " There was a polite patter of applause and the hour came to an end . I did n't applaud  --  even though I once again marveled at how easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essential triviality of his social personality to the intense intelligence of his professional one , and back again  --  since Asimov 's little speech took all my painfully gathered grounds for certainty and shook them badly . I believe in the murder of Giles Devore and so far had refused to accept any reasons advanced to support the contrary . Were there any conceivable reasons I would accept , or was I a true believer , dedicated to my belief though the heavens fall ? If Giles himself were to rise from the dead and swear that he had not been killed but had slipped in the bathtub , would I not reject that , too ? Would I not say that whatever had happened , whatever the attack , it had been so sudden and came from a source so trusted that Giles himself was mistaken and took murder for acci-dent ? And if I were a true believer , would my belief , however firm and inalienable , in the least change reality ? 7 ISAAC ASIMOV 12:15 P.M. I looked up and again Asimov was standing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent little speech you made at the end . I was impressed . " ( I must have remained in a brown study for longer than I had thought , for the audience had dispersed and only a handful remained at the door , talking to Charles Berlitz . ) Asimov grinned broadly , as he always does to any compliment ,  | from anyone about anything , and grew mellow enough to say , " Well , then , come have lunch with me , if you have nothing better to do . " Since lunch with him had been my hoped-for aim in attending the talk , I said , " Sure thing ! " Politeness forced me to say , " What about your panelist friends ? " " They 're off , " he said . " They just came in for the panel . " " In that case , in default of anything better for you , I will join you for lunch . " " Come on , " he said . " Do n't be falsely humble . " ( That remark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed . ) Apparently he had not yet come to the end of his good humor , for he added , " And lunch is on me . " I might have argued the point , but , frankly , the offer was so uncharacteristic of him that it took my breath away  --  so in default of objection on my part , lunch was on him. * It was Asimov 's idea that we leave the hotel and find a Chinese restaurant . I was delighted . I had had my surfeit of fried chicken and I was precisely in the mood for pressed duck and sweet-andsour pork . Off we went . During the five-block walk , Asimov said , " Say , do you remember that little girl with the breasts that tackled you Sunday night ? "  | " I remember , " I said grimly . " She did n't know who you were when she handed it to you , you know . She came to see me just as the autographing session was about to start yesterday and apologized very humbly  --  which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you should have seen her turn sick when I told her you were Darius Just . " " Not Dry as Dust ? " Asimov laughed , as he recognized , once again , the wit of this play on words . " Do n't be so damned sensitive , " he said . " Anyway , look her up , and give the poor thing a chance to make it up to you . " " She already has , " I said , " so we can forget it . " Asimov seemed taken aback at my tone of voice , but nothing takes him aback for longer than a second and a half , and in no time he was talking again . During the remainder of the walk , he prattled on about articles he had written denouncing astrology and various other lunatic-fringe beliefs and the letters these had educed . I answered in a desultory fashion , preferring to concentrate on my own thoughts , and finally we reached the restaurant , which , as so many Chinese places seem to be , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed . Once we had taken our seats , Asimov fell to studying the menu , and insisted on ordering for both of us , which suited me fine since he got the pressed duck and sweet-and-sour pork I had casually mentioned as we sat down , plus some soup and hors d'oeuvres . The waiter took it , after favoring us with a look of contempt when his invitation that we submerge ourselves swinishly in a variety of alcoholic beverages was haughtily rejected . I said , " You seem in high spirits , Isaac . " He said , " Well , I did my autographing stint yesterday and my panel today and now , after lunch , I can go home , take care of my mail , and get to work on an article that 's about due . " " And what about Murder at the ABA ? Do you have all the local color you need ? " " Enough , " he said airily . " I wo n't need much of it , I suppose . " " Do you have it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have enough to get started , and I have my gimmick , and I 'll make it up as I go along . " " What happens if you get tangled up in the middle and ca n't get out of the tangle ? " " Never happens , " he said cheerfully . " It always works out . " I sighed inaudibly . I wondered if some of us could n't arrange to picket him . About this time , the waiter filled the table with a dish of appetizers , and I knew that would be followed by the soup , and that by the main courses ( very efficient , the waiters at these restaurants ) with tea in between , so that there would be no use in continuing the conversation . Once food is on the table , Asimov is a spent force as far as social chitchat is concerned . His universe then consists of himself and food only . I ate quietly and made no attempt to keep up with him . I said , as he speared and devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will you kill off at your version of the ABA convention . Giles ? " It was as though I had pulled the chain and turned out his light . Even the afterglow of a good lunch seemed to fade . He said , " You know , I feel bad about Giles . I feel bad about him because I do n't feel bad about him . Do you know what I mean ? " " I do n't , " I said . " Well , I do an awful lot of kidding with an awful lot of people . You , for instance . I ca n't make myself say what people really mean to me ; I just drown it in horseplay . Then when people die , you wish they were back so you could say what you really felt . If you , for instance ? " " I know , " I said , " you 'd want me back to tell me that after all you never really noticed how short I was and that all your short jokes were not meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Ellison , if that 's his name . " He turned red . " Maybe something like that , Darius . But in Giles 's case , that 's not so . There 's nothing I want to say to him now that he 's dead . Darius , I did n't really like him more than just  | a little bit . " He owned up to it as though he were confessing a crime . I said , " No law against it . I did n't like him , either . " " But I do n't like not to like people . " " You ca n't always have everything you like . . . . Does that mean you wo n't use Giles in the book ? " " Not by name , of course . Not by anything identifiable . ' Who wants trouble with Eunice ? Still , after making all necessary changes , it 's possible that I 'll let Giles inspire something . Of course , it would have to be murder , not accident . " I thought : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I think it was murder , not accident . " You would think that what the " it " in that sentence referred to was obvious but people fight off unpleasantness and Asimov held it off one conversational exchange by saying , " What was murder , not accident ? " " Giles 's death , " I said . He stared at me for a long moment , then he said , in a voice half an octave higher than normaL " The police say he was killed ? " " Not the police , " I said . " They think it 's an accident , as far as I know . So does everyone else . I think it 's murder . As far as I know , only I think it 's murder . And I 'm trying to find evidence to support it , and I want to talk to you about it . " " To me ? " " Why not ? You owe me a little help . Damn it , your final speech at the panel shook me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . You made me think that perhaps he was n't killed . " Asimov looked relieved . " Good . I 'm sure he was n't . Drop it , Darius . " " I ca n't . I failed him night before last and I 've got to find out that that did n't contribute to his death . And even if I knew it did n't , I 've got to make up for that failure . " " It wo n't bring him back to life . " " Oddly enough , Isaac , I realize that . Getting this settled ,  | though , will help me continue to live with myself . Just a little , anyway . " " Well , then , what do I do ? Play the role of Watson ? " " Not unless and until I can be Holmes and , judging by what 's happened these last twenty-four hours , that will be never . No , I just want you to help me fill in the time between my last sight of Giles alive and my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you there ? I saw him two nights ago briefly and then never again  --  except for the autographing session . And besides " ? he grew thoughtful ? " I 'm not dying of eagerness to get involved . Once you start being a witness , heaven only knows how many hours you have to waste with the police and the courts ? and I 've got deadlines to meet . " It was the mention of deadlines and the knowledge that he had at most three months to write his mystery novel that impelled me to attempt a peculiar bribe . I said , " Look at it this way . If this turns out to be a murder , as I think it will , you may find yourself with a plot ready-made for your damned mystery . " " But then you 'll want to write it . " " I ? Never . I have better things to do than write stupid puzzlers . You write it . " I could see Asimov thinking quickly in the direction in which quick thought was his specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could write it with you as first person and introduce myself in the third . " I said , " Provided you do n't libel me . " " I 'd have to describe you as five feet two inches tall . That would be the most interesting thing about you . " " Five feet five , damn it . " " With elevator shoes . " " Look . You do what you want within the bounds of good taste  | and let me see the manuscript first and argue it out with you and maybe add a footnote for clarification now and then . And we 'll put it in writing , both of us . " " All right . But first let me call up my Doubleday editor . I do n't want to get involved in this if Larry Ashmead vetoes the idea . " " Go ahead ! " He was gone for about three minutes  --  which I spent wondering whether I ought to get into this , and rather hoping that Ashmead would say no . I doubted that Asimov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been as helpful as he could be , without it ( with a little coaxing ) , so why the devil had I offered it ? And then I thought  --  well , damn it , if it is murder and I can show it is , and work out the details , then why should n't I get some of the credit for it ? Asimov himself had wondered if I wanted him to be my Watson , and why should n't he be ? Once I had convinced myself I was doing it all out of a respectable drive for self-aggrandizement , I was satisfied and began to hope that Ashmead would say yes . He did . I could tell that from Asimov 's grin when he was still at the other end of the room . He said , " Larry 's out to lunch , but Cathleen says I can do it any way I want to and she 's sure Larry will feel the same . So now give me all the details and we 'll ? " " No ! " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it works out first. * For now , I just want to discuss the autographing session . " " It 's got to be written by August , Darius . " " That 's your problem . If nothing comes of this , you 'll have to work on the plot you 've already made up . You 'll be no worse off than you were ten minutes ago . " " Well , go ahead . What do you want to know about the autographing session ? "  | " When did Giles arrive at the session ? " " He came about five to eleven . I was there , seated and waiting . I believe in being early , damn it . I figure , what the hell , if people are kind enough to ? " " I know , " I said . " But he was n't late , was he ? " " About five minutes before , as I said . " " Who was it who brought him in ? " " Brought him in ? " Asimov looked blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on time . I was told that " ( I still did n't remember who told me that , but I was sure of the fact . ) He shook his head . " I did n't notice anyone . " I said impatiently , " Well , then , what kind of mood was he in ? How annoyed was he ? Was he shouting ? " Asimov looked blank again . " I did n't hear anything . Listen , there were a hundred people crowding round me and I was thoroughly occupied . There was the little dame showing up at the last minute and apologizing . " " I remember , " I said in annoyance . " Go on . " " So Giles was n't of great interest to me . I became aware of him sitting down at the other end of the stage about ten feet to my left . I shouted , Hi , Giles , ' and he looked at me with one of his basset-hound expressions . He struck me as being angry but there was no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waiting for me to sign and I had two hundred and fifty or so copies of Before the Golden Age , Volume Two , to hand out . " " But he did make a fuss eventually , did n't he ? " " Oh yes , I could n't miss that . For one thing , he stopped signing and that meant there was a pile-up . After all , everyone who got my signature passed on to get Giles 's . When Giles stopped signing , the line stopped moving . " " Did you know what was wrong ? " " Not right away . I said , What 's the matter ? ' and someone in the line said that Mr. Devore 's pen had run out of ink and I said I had a spare  --  you know , anything to get the line moving  --  but someone else gave him a pen , and then that ran out of ink ? " " Again ? "  | " Oh yes , twice in five minutes . Then Nellie Griswold of Hercules Books ran over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sort and then everything settled down and that was it . " " And what about Giles ? I presume he was swearing at me ? " " No . I did n't hear him swearing at you . Why should he swear at you ? " " Damn it , Isaac . He gave me a ticket to get a package for him out of the cloakroom , with a supply of pens in it , and I never got it for him . That 's the errand I failed to run . That 's where I messed him up . And he did n't say a word about that ? " " Not that I heard . But I see now why you 're feeling bad about this . Why the hell did n't he hand over the ticket to someone who was reliable ? " " You walked out on us , for one thing , if you 're talking about yourself . . . . The hell with it . What you 're saying , Isaac , is that the whole fuss , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing else was involved at all ? At all ? " " Not as far as I know . " " I want something else to be wrong . Something else that I 'm not responsible for . " " I ca n't help you . I told you all I know . " Asimov had signed the check , signed the credit-card slip , put away his credit card . He was clearly getting ready to leave . He said , " I wish I could do the dramatic thing . I wish that at the last minute I could remember something for you , some little apparently unimportant event that would break the whole case , but I ca n't do it . But why should that bother you ? I was ten feet away and completely busy with my own signings . I 'm not your best witness . Why not ask what's-her-name ? " " Nellie Griswold ? " " No . I mean , you can ask her if you want to , but that 's not the one . " He snapped his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that it might be the first sign of approaching senility . " I tried to be helpful . " Eunice ? What would she know ? " " Not Eunice ! Damn it , the woman who 's your editor , too . The gal from Prism Press , what's-her-name. "  | " Teresa ? " " Teresa Valier . That 's it . " I was surprised . " What 's she got to do with it ? " Asimov stood up . " She was sitting next to him , opening the books to the title page and handing them over for him to sign . " He looked aggrieved . " No one did that for me . I had to fumble the pages of two hundred and fifty books and sign them , too . " I said the natural thing . " Why the hell did n't you tell me this in the first place ? " He gave me the natural answer . " I assumed you knew . " How could he assume I knew that if I had n't been there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at my watch and it was well past two . Asimov said , " Will you be seeing her ? Do you want me to come along ? " " I may see her . But if I do , then  --  no , I do n't want you along . " He shrugged . I guess he did n't really want to be involved and his momentary urge toward active Watsondom abated . So we separated and I did n't see him again during what remained of the convention . 8 TERESA VALIER 2:20 P.M. It was twenty after two , which was borderline . Teresa might be back from lunch , or she might not  --  or she might not have come to work today  --  or she might be at the convention , though I doubted that strongly , not if she had gone home with a sick headache after she had heard of Giles 's death . But I was only two blocks from the Prism Press offices and it was home away from home for me , anyhow . Why not walk over ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator door was closing as I walked into the building , but the elevator operator knew me well , and having caught a glimpse of me through the closing door , opened it again . When I walked in , I found Teresa there . Her loud , glad greeting was a little less loud and a lot less glad than usual and when I said , " I 've got to have ten minutes , Terry  | ? it 's about Giles , " it got dramatically less glad still . In fact , when we got off at the eighteenth floor , she was crying as she rushed past a startled receptionist . I followed quickly . " Come on , Terry , they 'll think I made a pass at you . " " I do n't cry over passes , " she said , " and I do n't want to talk about Giles , Darius . " " Please , just a little , " I said . We were in her office but we had n't dashed in so quickly that I had lacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which was good . I did n't want him to interfere . I closed the office door . " Come on , Teresa . I 've got to know what happened . " " What 's to know ? He fell and was killed and I just hate people I know dying  --  especially when I 've been hating them before they died . It makes me feel so  --  damned responsible . " The tears were still rolling and she was snatching paper tissues out of a box on her desk . I felt distressed for her sake . " I mean what happened at the autographing session ? That 's what I 've got to know . " Then desperately , " Do n't cry , Teresa , do n't cry . If you just talk to me , I promise that you 'll see it was my fault , not yours . " " Your fault ? You had nothing to do with it . " " You heard Giles say it was my fault , did n't you ? " She was looking at me suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said , " He did n't say anything at all about you . What are you talking about ? Unless it was while I was gone . " I sighed . " Please , Terry , tell me about it and then I 'll explain why it was n't your fault , and I 'll go away . " She looked at her watch . " I 'm expecting someone ? " " They 'll wait , whoever it is , " I said urgently . " I 've waited for you often enough . Come on . Begin at the beginning . " Teresa said . " The beginning was months ago , when I made the arrangement for having Giles autograph his new book at the convention and promised him I 'd open the books for him . That pleased him and helped persuade him to agree to do the signing .  | You know the kind of man he is  --  was . It made him feel important to have the publisher open books for him . " Of course , then the business started about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go to hell , but Tom wanted to go through with it . You know , smile through the tears , make everything look normal to the last possible minute . " She made a feeble gung-ho gesture with her right arm and went on . " So I was there fifteen minutes early and so was the other guy who was autographing , raising the roof and hugging the girls and making me all the more nervous about Giles  --  you know , why could n't he be early ? And then he was there ? " I interrupted . " It 's my understanding that he was more or less dragged in by some woman . Was n't he ? " She stared at me . " Was he ? I did n't see anyone with him . " " Well , was he angry ? " " I do n't know . I was angry , because I 'd had a fight with Tom over the whole business . I was sure Giles would n't change his mind , and I said the hell with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good autographing session , I might get a chance to make one more try . And I said , What do you mean , humor him ? How far do I go ? ' and he ? Well , it was rotten . So I did n't look at him particularly , just enough to know he was there , and then I was ready to open books for him . But I did n't have any pens . " " Were you supposed to ? " " It 's routine . Some authors arrive without pens  --  too ethereal to think of any such mundane things  --  or they bring their special pen that does n't work . Giles is different , however . He always insists on using his own pens  --  his special monogrammed ones , you know  --  and wo n't use any others . Well , ordinarily , I would bring pens anyway , just to backstop , but this time I thought  --  well , screw him . I had to show my hostility somehow , so I did n't bring any pens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagstones that had laid out the fine path to my failure , and here was one that was later than any that had been laid for me . I said , " Does that make you responsible for his death ? "  | " In a way , I suppose it does , " she said , but she was n't crying now . " If I had had pens , the whole damned fuss might not have taken place and he would n't have been so upset that he would ? would ? " " Storm upstairs for a shower and be so blind with fury that he slipped , fell , and killed himself ? " " It could be that . " " I suppose so , but the fact is that I was supposed to bring him a supply of pens the night before and I had forgotten to do it . So you see , the primary fault is mine and not yours . Now please tell me what happened . Give me the details of the fuss . " " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing happened . He signed every book I put before him the same way : best wishes , his name , the date . He did n't say a word , he did n't smile , he did n't look up . I could hear the other fellow  --  what's-hisname  --  the one who writes all the books ? " " Isaac Asimov . " " Yes , I could hear him babbling constantly , talking to each one , flirting with the girls . " " I know , " I said . " I know his corn-ball routine . " " All right . People enjoy it . They leave him and come to Giles , expecting more of the same , and all they got was dead silence . " " He was upset over my failure to get him his pens , " I said . " Little failures in accustomed routines upset him . " " If what you did upset him , why take it out on the general public ? " " Why ' is a crooked letter , my old man used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does that mean ? " she asked . " I 'm not sure , but it sounds good . Please go on . " " Eventually his pen gave out and he just sat back . I said , What 's the matter ? ' and he said , Out of ink , ' in a high-pitched voice , with his lower lip pushed out . He just sat there . Naturally the line stopped and Asimov stood up and wanted to know what was wrong . I was just sitting there , too thunderstruck to do anything . Asimov offered a pen and so did whoever was waiting for  | the autograph . He pushed his pen toward Giles and took the pen Giles was holding  --  for a souvenir , I suppose . " Giles had to stir himself up to the point of using the new pen and then for five minutes everything seemed smooth and then the new pen ran out of ink . It was like a nightmare . It was as though God were punishing me for not having brought spare pens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as though she were reliving the experience too closely . I said , " What did you do ? " " I just got up and left to get new pens . I forgot Asimov had offered one and pushed past him . I could n't think of anything better to do than go down the escalator to the hotel desk . I was just completely derailed , that 's all . By the time I got back , I found that a girl from Hercules Books had given him a pen . Apparently there was a fuss about that , too , but I had missed it , thank God , and I do n't want to know about it . The signing went on to the end without any other hitches . I tell you , it was the longest hour I 've ever spent outside a maternity ward . " After it was over , I left . I did n't speak to Giles or look at him . In fact , I never saw him again , and when I heard he was dead , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss over the pens had just sent him off his rocker . I went home with a migraine . " I said , " But you 're better now ? " " A little , " she said woefully . " Thank God , Tom is bearing up . " " Oh yes , he 's bearing up , " I said . " And you say that while the fuss was on , he did n't say anything about me ? " " Nothing  --  unless it was while I was gone . " " How long were you gone ? " " I do n't know . Five minutes , maybe . " " Funny . " " What difference does it make whether he said anything about you or not ? " " Well , " I said a little abstractedly , " if he did n't say anything about me all that time , maybe it was something else that was bothering him . Look , Teresa , was there anything Giles did , anything at all that you can think of , anything that would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pens ? " Teresa shook her head emphatically . " As far as I know , it was the pens , pens , pens . " " Did he say anything , or did anyone else say anything , or do anything for that matter , that struck you at the time as odd ; or that strikes you as odd now that you look back on it ? " " No , " she said . I threw up my arms . " I was told he complained about me . " Teresa said , " Maybe that girl from Hercules Books heard him . She was with him when I was n't there . " " Maybe you 're right . In that case , can I use the phone in the conference room for a while ? " " Go ahead , provided no one else is using it . Close the door , if you want privacy . " " Thanks , " I said , and left . 9 HENRIETTA CORVASS 3:15 P.M. I did want privacy . It was n't that anything I intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to think . I visited the men 's room , thought there for a moment , then went to the conference room and thought there for a longer time . Periodically , I wanted to think  --  as though something would happen if I did , as though something would break and , at the center of that something , I would find the answer . But not so . No matter how closely I examined the events hovering about Giles in that less-than-a-day after I had seen him alive , I could find nothing that could serve as a reasonable prelude to murder . Well , one step I might take would be to fill the remaining lacuna at the autographing session , so I put in a call to Hercules Books . It would take too much time to walk there and back , and too much money to taxi there and back , if Nellie Griswold was n't there . It she was there , it might serve the purpose to talk by tele " Hercules , " the telephone told me . I asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that answered the proper extension  | disclaimed the identity . She told me in a semi-childish semi-treble that Miss Griswold was at the ABA convention . " Are you sure ? " I said , which was a silly question . How could anyone be sure ? The owner of the voice was n't so semi-childish as not to see that point . She said cautiously , " She 's supposed to be . " " All right . I 'll walk over . Thank you , " and I hung up . I looked at my watch . It was well after three . If she was there , she would remain there for perhaps two hours . I went back to the hotel , still thinking , braced by the fact that it was a sunny , mild , and entirely pleasant afternoon . There were two things  --  no , three  --  that puzzled me . First , was there any connection with drugs ? God knows , I have no gift for looking deeply into a man 's soul , but I had lived with Giles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee because of the caffeine ; he worried about food additives ; he was forever on the verge of toppling over into natural foods . Of course , a man can compartmentalize his life . I knew lots of natural-food freaks who inveighed against the damage chemicals did while peering through the smoke of chains of cigarettes out of eyes whose lids were covered with oily colored gunk . There was his writing . I had known it well in its early stages and there were numerous sections that I would consider as representing views incompatible with drug addiction . And yet might that be taken in reverse ? Every stick pointed in two directions , one opposed to the other . The second was the question of his complaint against me . He had gone through torture during the autographing session and Sarah had heard him mutter my name in anger . I would like to get corroboration of that and perhaps greater detail , and Nellie Griswold might supply it . Finally , there was the question of the woman who had brought him in that morning . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the more it seemed to me she might have been with him all morning , and all night . before , too , for that matter , and might represent the entire key to the matter . And with my foot virtually on the escalator to the exhibition  | floor , the thought of that unknown woman overcame me and I decided to postpone Nellie  --  for just a little while . I took the elevator to the fifth floor . The interview room seemed as hectic as ever . Leo Durocher had just been interviewed concerning his autobiography and I just caught a glimpse of him leaving . For a minute , I stopped to stare at his back , remembering the time twenty years back and more when I had been an ardent baseball fan and he had been one of my villains . The flash passed ; it may have lasted five seconds , not more ; and I was grateful to him , then , for supplying me with five seconds in which I totally forgot the convention and its miseries . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for Henrietta Corvass . She saw me , I suppose , before I saw her , for when I detected her presence , her back was to me and she was just out the door . I moved quickly and overtook her in the hall about three doorways down and seized her elbow . She shook me off . " Wait , " I said . She turned , her eyes narrowed and bitter . " What the hell do you want ? " Clearly , she regretted having talked to me the evening before ; she resented the hold I had over her in knowing too much about her . I spread out my hands and said in a low voice , " Nothing about last night . Nothing . " " Well , then ? " " The morning . " " What about the morning ? " " You said you had n't picked up Giles yesterday morning . Please , think again , and do n't twist things . If you did pick him up ? " She turned to face me full and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exasperation I had n't seen in years . " You must be crazy , " she said . " Right out of your mind . Do you think , after what happened , I 'd go near him ? " " You would n't want him to be late for the autographing session , would you ? "  | " I did n't give a f ? for the autographing session . " She said it as loudly as she could , and I did n't wince because the emotion with which she charged it made it the mot juste . " But somebody brought him . I know that . Who was it ? " " I did n't send anyone . I told you , I was n't even there . If anyone went of their own accord , that 's their business . " " Who would it be ? " " I do n't know . I do n't care . " " Would you find out for me ? " " No , I wo n't . Find out for yourself . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet of the corridor . I stared after her nonplussed , and then went back to the interview room . 10 GORDON HAMMER 3:40 P.M. It was hard to tell which of the individuals were functionaries of the interview department , but I picked a young man with pinched-in cheeks , pale blond hair , and a thin , nervous look about him . " Listen , " I said , " you 're working in the interview room , are n't you ? " " What about it ? " he asked suspiciously . " I 'm Darius Just ; I 'm a writer . " He relaxed visibly . He even smiled . " Oh , sure , I 've heard of you . My name 's Gordon Hammer . " " Thank you , Gordon , " I said . " Could you tell me something ? " " I can try . " " How many women are working here for the convention besides Henrietta ? " " It 's hard to tell . Some are just volunteers who run errands . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to get Giles Devore yesterday morning to see that he got to the autographing session ? " He looked confused . " I do n't think anyone did that . It 's not our job . "  | " Someone did , " I said , firmly positive . " Could you find out for me ? " He said weakly , " I do n't see how ? " But then he walked over to one of the girls and talked to her in a low voice . Then to another . I kept my eye on him and waited . When he returned , he was scratching his head . " I do n't think anyone did . " " Is everyone eliminated entirely ? Think , please . " He said , " It might be Stephanie . " " Stephanie who ? " " I do n't know her last name . " " Where is she ? " " She is n't in today . She just worked Sunday and Monday . She 's back in school now . " " Do you know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . " " Okay . " But as I turned to go , he touched me very gently on the shoulder . " Mr. Just ? " " Yes ? ' " Has Stephanie done anything wrong ? I mean , she 's only fourteen . " " No , no , " I said hastily . " I 'm just checking on something . Giles Devore was a friend of mine and I 'm trying to find out as much as possible of his last day for a  --  for a  --  eulogy I 'm writing . " It seemed to carry conviction , for a look of great relief came over his face . " I see . Okay . " Of course , it was n't okay . I did n't relish the thought of having to ask a fourteen-year-old what had transpired that morning , considering what might have transpired . It was not so much the thought of the futility of expecting useful answers that troubled me , as the possibility of inducing a fit of hysterics that would bring parents down upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any days . After all , Juliet was fourteen No , that was silly , and I had no time to follow up at the mo-  | ment . It was almost four and it was time to find Nellie of Hercules . ll NELLIE GRISWOLD 3:55 P.M. Although I did n't know her , I had no trouble detecting her at the Hercules booth . She had been described as " nice " with that particular roll of the masculine eye which gives that bland word an unmistakable flavor , and what I saw fit that exactly . She was five feet ten or eleven inches tall , with her brown hair at shoulder length , with a narrow waist that rather emphasized the caboose effect of her rear end . Her breasts were perfectly shaped and were encased in a brassiere of the type chosen by women who strongly suspect their breasts to be perfectly shaped . Her nose was a little long and her eyes a little small , which meant she was no raving beauty , but they did combine to give her face an open look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Miss Griswold . " I had put on my badge to get into the exhibit area and she looked at it , then said excitedly , " Mr. Justl I admire your books very much . " There 's no such thing as a better opener than that , and she went on immediately to improve on it . She said , " You know that Hercules is interested in doing a paperback of your new book . " " I do n't know , " I said . " The Valiers have shown us some of what you 've done and it 's made a good impression on our editor in chief . I read it , too , and I love it . " And I love you , lady . She looked so damned good to me at that point that I would have given my second-best typewriter to be able to forget Giles and invite Nellie to dinner , and maybe end up by not doing right by our Nell , if she were willing . But Giles came first just at that moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's great , but if you do n't mind , I wo n't count my chickens . We 'll see how you and Hercules like it when it 's done . "  | " Will that be soon ? " " If I can be left alone at my typewriter , maybe two months . In actual fact , probably four . But look , would you answer some ques-tions ? " " What kind ? " She seemed just interested , not in any way suspicious . " Well , you were at the autographing session yesterday with Devore and Asimov ? " " Yes . Asimov is one of our outstanding authors , you know . " " I know , " I said . " But it 's Devore I 'm interested in . You brought him a pen , I understand . " " Oh , yes , and what a bummer that was . Were you there ? " " No , I was n't . " " Well , let me tell you what happened . " She was the first person I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " Please . " She said , " I was there mostly for Asimov , making sure he had enough books and that things were going smoothly . " " He was a little annoyed you were n't opening books for him , " I said , getting in the needle just a bit on Isaac 's behalf . She dismissed it with a wave of the hand . " I was more useful keeping the line in order . Besides , whatever Isaac said , he loved it . You know him , he just eats it up ; he can sit there signing books for twelve hours , grinning and scribbling . So my attention wandered to Giles Devore and , boy , he was different . He looked as though he were suffering . " " He was , " I muttered . She paid no attention to the comment . " His pen ran out of ink and for some reason Teresa Valier , who was next to him , did n't have any spares , which I thought was pretty irresponsible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him . It looked as though the trouble was all over and then came crisis number two when the second pen went dry .  | " Devore seemed to fall apart . He just sat there with his face working and Teresa simply ran off the stage . Well , the line stopped and I could see Asimov getting out of his seat and beginning to look nervous , and I was in charge of him . So I dashed over to Devore with another pen . I had plenty . " He took it automatically , as though he were n't really there . He did n't even look down as he started to write with it . After a second or two , though , he stopped and said in a thin whisper , It 's red . ' I had given him a red-ink ball-point , you see . It was crisis number three . I said , It 's all right . Fans like it red . ' So he started writing again . " By then , Teresa was back and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was continuing to sign in red and there was no more trouble . Of course , when the session was over , he threw my red-ink pen against the wall and walked away without talking to anybody , so he was clearly annoyed . I guess I was lucky he did n't throw it at me . " And then , two hours later , he was dead and I ? Oh my , you were the one who found him , were n't you ? " I nodded . " Yes , but never mind that . What were you going to say ? " " Just that I wondered if he was so upset that he could n't keep his footing in the tub , and that maybe it was my red pen that was the last straw . " I said , " Everyone wants the credit . The fact is that I had his set of pens and I did n't get it to him . If I had n't muffed it , there would have been no trouble , so if there 's credit , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly a very warm girl , and I made another silent check mark in her favor ) and she said , " That 's too bad . " " Never mind . Listen , Nellie , tell me , was there anything in what he did , or said , or looked like , or anything , that gave you the impression that it was anything at all , other than the pens going dry or being red , that was upsetting him ? " She thought a while , then shook her head wistfully . " If it was anything else , there 's no way of telling that I can think of . " " Okay , one more question . Did you see who it was who brought him into the room ? "  | " You mean at the beginning of the autographing session ? " " Yes . " She shook her head again . " I did n't even see him come in . " I stood there for a moment , frowning . No one had seen him come in with a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so remained . Who had told me that ? I remembered ! It was quite sudden . I saw the face ; I heard the voice . It was the checkroom woman . When Giles had come to question her about the package to which he had no check , he had been urged on by the woman accompanying him . She even called her by some name . It was like having the roof cave in and every bit of plaster fall on my head . I said , " Look , Nellie , when you were near Giles , did you , at any time , hear him mention me , express anger in any way about me ? " " No . As far as I recall , he never said a word that I heard except It 's red : " " Thanks , " I said . " Thanks . I think I 'm in love with you , so keep me in mind . " And I ran from the exhibit area , as well as I could for having to dodge people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I had to take time to clear up the loose ends . Unless I were certain , I would n't have the clout to drive it home . It took me a while to get out of the area , and another while for the elevator to come . It seemed like a much longer while than it took but eventually I was back up on the fifth floor . I found him  --  Gordon Hammer , the young man with the pinched-in cheeks  --  and grabbed his shoulder and shook . He looked startled . I said , " That fourteen-year-old you told me about ? ' What did you say her name was ? " " Stephanie ? " " Yes , yes . She 's a little girl , right ? You said only fourteen . " I was holding my arm out at shoulder level  --  my shoulder level ,  | which would make her quite small , but maybe not for a fourteenyear-old . But Hammer 's lips swelled and he sputtered for a moment or two . Finally he said , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind my being personal . " I suppose I looked grim enough to show that I did mind so that his moment of laughing faded into anxiety again . Then he said , " And she 's fat , really fat . No one would call her little . " 13 DOROTHY 4:25 P.M. That removed the last possible source of confusion  --  the last one I could think of unless some entirely unknown factor had entered into it . It was back down to the second floor and my watch showed the time to be nearly half past four . I had a notion it was too late to find the next person I needed  --  the one who had seen the woman . When the elevator did n't come after fifteen seconds , I damned it quite loudly and dashed down the stairs . I probably did n't beat the elevator but there was no way in which I could stand still , even to save time . I ran across the lobby to the cloakroom , dodging through the crowds , and then pushed past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gasped . " Where 's the attendant ? " " I 'm the attendant , " said an elderly woman , still pretty , with white hair , metal-rimmed glasses , and a refined way of speaking which she probably cultivated very carefully . Her nameplate said : Dorothy . " Not you . The other one . Dyed yellow hair , fat arms , tinted glasses , nose twitches . I do n't remember her name . . . . Excuse me , excuse me . This is important . I 'll be out of your way in a minute . " That last was to the other people waiting there , who looked increasingly exasperated . The elderly attendant  --  Dorothy  --  smiled as though she recognized the picture without trouble . " That 's Hilda . She gets off at four . " " Do you know where she lives ? " " No , " she said briefly and disapprovingly . ( Come on , I thought  | impatiently , you ca n't think for a minute I have anything improper in mind . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " Well , wait , let me just ask you one question . Is there a woman around here that you and Hilda call Little Pepper . " She smiled again . " Oh , sure , that 's the ? " Then she stopped and said primly . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , and I 'm busy . " But I was off and running again . It was someone familiar , someone both she and Hilda knew , someone who was little , and peppery , and well known to them . Now to get to the sixth floor at last , and it was still well before five . 14 GINGER 4:35 P.M. The inner room looked empty . I did n't have to go in to check its corners ; it had the unmistakable look of emptiness , and my heart sank . I was bubbling over with resentment and I wanted things straightened out right now . The good-looking black receptionist , or secretary , or whatever , was at her desk . I remembered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eying me with a controlled amusement and I was quite certain she remembered me . " Can I help you ? " she said . " I do n't know . Can you tell me where Miss Vosto  --  Voskovek might be ? " In my impatience , I found myself still stumbling over the name . I felt there was no use asking . She was gone . But Ginger said , " I do n't know where she is , but I know she 'll be back . Wo n't you wait ? " Her voice was friendly , and she continued to be amused . I was n't sure what it was she was amused about , but it made me feel uncomfortable . I sat down abruptly and fidgeted . I had nothing to read , and although I consulted my watch often enough , its capacity to console and distract me was sharply limited . Ginger 's equanimity , her apparent warm and confident acceptance of the fact that Sarah would be back , was all that kept me in my seat after a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her footsteps outside . I had no doubt it was she  --  short footsteps , fussy but firm , with the high heels making sharp clicking noises . I stood up . She walked in , looked at me , stopped in clear consternation , and said , " Is something wrong , Darius ? " I said , " I want to speak to you . " She said , " Can you wait a bit till I clear up some things ? " " Will you have to rush away to go home then ? " " No , " she said doubtfully . " Not if it 's something important " " It 's important . " " Then please wait . " She did n't seem unduly disturbed . I sat down again and returned to my fidgeting . After a while , Ginger stacked some papers neatly at one side of her desk , made some scrabbling noises under the desk which I interpreted as getting her shoes on , and took her purse out of a desk drawer . She said in a brisk voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it she was giving fair warning that we would be alone together . She smiled at me as she left  --  wishing me luck , I think , which was nice of her but inappropriate to the occasion . Sarah 's voice came back , clear and serene . " Very good , Ginger . Have a nice evening . " Two more minutes passed . Sarah came into the outer room , looked casually out into the hall , then closed the door softly , pulled down a shade , and motioned me into the inner room . " If you want to talk further about our last topic of conversation , " she said , " we could n't do it with anyone else here , you understand . " I sat down on the couch in her office . She remained standing . I said , " Did you know the hired hands around here call you Little Pepper ? " " I 've heard the phrase , " she said indifferently . " Where did you hear it ? " I ignored her question . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hatred . Through clenched teeth , I imagine . " " Clenched teeth or not , he did . " " I 'm sure of it . Not , however , at the autographing session .  | There were three people near him part or all of the time . There were Isaac Asimov , Teresa Valier , and Nellie Griswold , and not one heard him say a thing about me . " She said , " I did n't say it was at the autographing session . I believe I said later . ' " " I do n't remember your exact words , " I said . " I got the impression , however , that it was at the autographing session . I was wrong , I suppose . And I 'm not surprised , since I 'm a very poor detective . I 'll accept your statement now that it was later  --  but might it not have been earlier ? " " Why earlier ? " " You were here at the beginning , were n't you , when you apologized to Asimov and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Yes , and about the time when Asimov was talking to you , he became aware that Giles was present , so I suspect you two came in together . " " I leave you to your suspicion . " " It 's more than a suspicion . None of the press people will admit to having escorted Giles to the autographing room , but someone did , because the cloakroom girl saw him that morning . He tried to get a package for which he did n't have the ticket and , the cloakroom girl said , Little Pepper urged him onward lest he be late . How about that , Little Pepper ? " Sarah took the seat behind her desk , placing three feet of steel between us . She said , " I have n't lied to you . He did make it clear that he was furious with you and there was unpleasantness at the session , and I had apologized to Asimov and had also found out who you were . I came to warn you of Mr. Devore 's fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with that , but you did n't tell me the whole truth , did you ? You did n't say you had been with him before the autographing session . " I paused a moment , then decided to say it . " Or , possibly , the whole previous night as well . " I was prepared for a storm , but she only reddened a bit , and clasped her hands tightly together so that the knuckles whitened as they interlaced on her desk .  | " If I had , " she said , " then it would be no business of yours , but , as it happens , I had n't . I was at home that night , in my own bed and alone . If you do n't believe that , there 's no need for you to sit here asking me any more questions . " " But if there was nothing to hide , why not tell me you had been with Devore before the autographing session ? " " Why on earth should I tell you ? I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I did n't know the man was dead at the time and that you suspected murder later on . And if I had known , there was still no reason to tell you , since you are n't the police . You still are n't , right now , and I do n't have to tell you anything . " I said , " No , I 'm not the police . Still , if you 're worried over my getting into trouble over this matter of drugs , then do n't mislead me and let me run the chance of getting into trouble through ignorance or misapprehension . " " The death of Devore ca n't have anything to do with drugs . " " I do n't accept that , but if there 's anything you can tell me that will show that you 're right , I will change my mind . So please tell me . Tell me everything that happened from the moment you saw him yesterday morning . " She stirred uneasily in her chair . She said , " All right . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long after I got to work ? " " By the way , " I said , " how is it you were working Memorial Day ? " " I 've told you , have n't I ? We 've got a major advertising campaign coming up and the art department has flubbed it , so I 've been here all weekend and so have they . " " And the security chief , what's-his-name  --  Marsogliani . He was here , too . Is he involved in the advertising campaign also ? " " No , he 's not , " she said , with just a touch of acid , " but he 's always here when there 's a major convention at the hotel . Why ? Do you think we all got here on an off day to work out a conspiracy against your friend ? " I felt a little foolish under the lash of her contempt and said , " No . I 'm just trying to ask all the questions I can think of . " I added , humbly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mollified . " All right . But do n't worry about us . We make up any off days we lose . " " Well , then , what happened at nine A.M. not long after you got to work ? " " I got word from the desk that there were peculiar phone calls arriving from Room 1511 . " " Why did they report that to you ? Why not to Marsogliani ? " " Marsogliani had n't arrived yet , and in any case minor troubles come to me occasionally . I have a perhaps exaggerated reputation in the hotel as a fix-it of miscellaneous mix-ups . " " Well , what did you do ? " " I checked on the occupant of the room and it was Giles Devore . That concerned me because he was a VIP at this convention and if something was wrong with him , it might mean unpleasant publicity . I decided to go up to the fifteenth floor . " " What were the phone calls about ? " I asked , without the slightest doubt as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the calls was n't sure . He said they were garbled and incomprehensible and , at one point , it sounded as though he were weeping . The clerk suggested that I call a doctor . " " Maybe you should have . " " Not at all . If a resident at the hotel wants a doctor , that 's one thing . You ca n't force a doctor on him , however , without his consent , unless you have reason to think he is in no position to give consent . I went up to check . " He answered the door , fully dressed , but with his hair grotesquely uncombed and with an oddly feverish look in his eye . The room was in complete disarray . He said , Are you the cloakroom woman ? ' I told him who I was and he said , Please come in and help me . ' " I went in . I was upset at his obvious misery . I 've read his book , you know , and I admired it ; and here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " What happened after you went in ? " She said , " He sat down on the bed with his face all twisted as though he were on the point of crying . He said , I 've looked all over . It is n't here . ' I said , What is n't here ? ' He said , The pack-  | age . It 's not here . It was supposed to be here last night but I forgot . I was busy . ' " I seized upon that . " He was busy . Did he say with what ? " Sarah shook her head . " I ca n't repeat what he said exactly . It was all very confused and repetitious and it 's not as though I had a tape recorder there . " " Tell me what you can . " " I 'll give you the impression I gathered . He had come to his room fairly late the night before from some television taping session and he had n't been entirely well . There was a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a bad woman ? " " A bad woman ? " " That 's what he said , over and over . " " He did n't name her ? " " No , he did n't . And I did n't ask . " " No , of course not . Please go on . " She said , " He had needed help , and she would n't help , or not enough , even though he had begged and pleaded , and when I asked , in what I hope was a cool and businesslike voice , if he wanted a doctor , he said no , very emphatically . He then went on to explain , quite repetitiously , that he had needed help and she would n't help him . He was very sorry for himself , almost disgustingly so . He was destroying my respect for him and I was embarrassed to be there . " I said , " Was it your impression that he was under the influence of drugs ? " " The thought did n't occur to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to tell ? " She hesitated for quite a while , and since it seemed to me she was trying to say something , I kept quiet and let her struggle . Finally she said , " I should n't tell you this . It 's confidential . The autopsy has been performed and Security received a copy a couple of hours ago . I saw it  --  and there are no signs that he had been taking drugs . " I was glad to hear that . " Then that 's one thing we can eliminate . " " As I told you , drugs had nothing to do with Mr. Devore 's death . "  | " Yes , but you did n't tell me why . At that , though , he did n't have to be an addict . Drugs could have been involved in his death if he were a pusher . " She grimaced . " Do you think he was a pusher , that poor , flabby little boy ? " " Little boy ! He was a hulk ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys come in all sizes . I could see him as an addict , but not as a pusher . " " I ca n't either , to be honest with you , but it 's got to be something , does n't it , to account for the murder ? " " Not at all . His death could be an accident . Everyone but yourself is sure it was . " I shrugged . " Well , go on . " She said , " He went on to say that he had felt so ill after this unsympathetic woman  --  he kept calling her bad ' ? left that he just went right to sleep without ever thinking about the package . " " Do you think he was telling the truth ? " She said , " Why should he have lied ? " " I do n't know . Do you think he was telling the truth ? " " How can I possibly know ? " " What was your impression ? " " I assumed he was telling the truth . As I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was too upset and too out-of-control to lie . Unless you 're pathogenic about it , it takes considerable effort to make up a lie . Was he a pathogenic liar ? " I thought about it . " No . I ca n't say I recall him lying to me , not even under provocation . " " You knew him well , then ? " " I lived with him for a considerable time , " I said dryly , " in the nonsexual sense of the term . " " Then I would say he was telling the truth . " " Let 's assume he was . Then , after the woman left , he went to sleep , and can we further assume that he had awakened not long before your arrival ? " " Some time before . There was a cup of coffee on the telephone table that was half full and had probably been made with the electric coffee maker . "  | " You mean that he had n't called room service for breakfast ? " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check that out with room service , however . " " Well , if we have to , we will . But if he slept all night , then that would mean he had n't left the room , and possibly the hotel , in search of a woman who would be sympathetic . And if he had n't done that , then we lose a large possible source of motivations for the murder . " " You 're still convinced it was murder ? " " Yes . And if the night is closed off , that leaves us with the missing package as the only unusual thing that could explain the whole tragedy . I dislike that . " " Because it is n't motive enough ? " " I do n't see how it can be , but mainly I dislike it because I was supposed to bring it to his room night before last and I did n't . That was the errand I told you I had forgotten yesterday afternoon . . . . Unless , of course , there 's something we still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , Sarah , did he say anything , do anything , give you any impression at all , that something was bothering him other than the package ? " " The woman of the night before , whoever she was , was bothering him , " she said firmly , " but except for that , it was the package all the way . " " All right , go on , then . " She said , " Once he woke up , he said , he remembered the package and started looking for it . He was in a state of fury , I suppose , that made him pretty irrational , for he tore the bed apart , had all the towels on the floor , the blankets out of the closet , and so on . He might have had some dim thought that you had hidden the package in order to annoy him . " I shook my head . " It would never have occurred to me . " " Then he called the desk . I gather he was trying to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not , to whom she had given it . " I said , " Listen , when he came back the night before , he could have gotten the package , could n't he ? How late are the cloakrooms open ? "  | " Till midnight . " " And if he did n't have a ticket ? " " That could have been complicated . Still , if he had been able to identify the package , it could have been opened in the presence of the assistant manager . " " Did he tell you what was in the package ? " " No . Do you know ? " " Yes , I do . Pens . Monogrammed pens . Total worth , maybe ten dollars . And if he had had it opened , his name on those pens would have proved his ownership . That idiot ! Dead or not , I 've got to call him an idiot . If he had just held on to his damned ticket , he could have gotten his package when he came back . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They take precautions . They worry about taking chances . I suppose he thought that if he did n't ask you to get the package for him , he would worry all evening long that the cloakroom might be closed when he returned ? " " And that would have affected his television taping . Yes , I suppose so . Please go on . " " It was about nine-thirty by then and he said he had an autographing session at ten . So I said , Well , let 's clean up your room and go . I 'll see to it that you get your package if it 's still in the cloakroom . ' I was trying to calm him down , you understand , because it seemed to me he was dangerously close to going out of control .... Are you sure , Darius , that the package contained only pens ? " " Not sure , " I said cautiously , " in the sense that I ever saw the contents , but Mrs. Devore said they were pens in there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that Giles is compulsive . When things do n't follow the scenario he has prepared , he goes wild . Besides , he was trying to change publishers and , between being afraid of losing a big chance and being afraid he was being unethical , he was probably very much uptight and on edge . And besides ? " I wanted to go on and say that since he had failed to work off his little-boy syndrome with Henrietta the night before , he was still a little boy  --  Sarah had described him exactly that way , as a  | matter of fact . Certainly , he acted like a little boy over the pens going dry . But I kept it to myself . I was n't going to give her anything that would guide her in what she had left to tell . I said , " So you cleaned up the room ? " " Yes . I did n't vacuum it , you understand , but I put back the blankets and towels , and made the beds . He did n't help much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away ? " " Oh yes . They were that way to begin with . " " You did n't leave any clothes hanging around on the chairs or bed ? " " No , " she said firmly . " By the time I was done , it was about ten minutes to ten and I felt it was my responsibility to get him down to the autographing . It was n't too hard to lead him , though I kept thinking that I had a robot by the elbow , one who would go wherever pressure impelled him but would stop if he were released and just stand in one spot indefinitely . " Once we were in the elevator , however , he did insist on going to the cloakroom . I was in no position to make a scene since the elevator , I assure you , was not empty . So we stopped off at the second floor . I knew it would be difficult to negotiate anything quickly with Hilda  --  she 's a rather hard-bitten attendant and we only had a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , I urged Devore on , telling him I would get the package for him in a few minutes , as soon as he was safely delivered to the autographing session . " " But you did n't get the package , did you ? " " No , " she said , with a shake of her head . " I was just keeping him quiet . Besides I did n't think there was any point in getting it till he was through with the autographing . It never occurred to me that he needed it for the autographing ; and he never told me what it was . Even if I had known it was pens , though , it would have seemed to me that the world is full of pens and you could borrow one from anyone about you . " " Not a monogrammed Devore pen out of which to manufacture a monogrammed Devore book . " " Well , I did n't know that , you see . " " All right , go on . "  | " We got into the autographing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were coming to life again . I let him go , figuring he could find his way to the stage himself , and he did . I saw him in his seat after a while . " " And no one saw you come in with him ? " " People saw him and people saw me , but I do n't know if anyone saw us both together . The place was crowded as we walked in because another autographing session was just finishing up , and Devore pulled away from me at the threshold . " " You must have stayed there , though . You knew about the fuss Giles had made . Or did someone tell you ? " " No . I remained . I noticed Asimov standing there and I felt impelled to go to him and apologize for my attitude the night before . I had come on a little strong but , you know , I was having trouble with the art people and the pressures on me were a little intense . He was nice about it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rather flabbergasted me . " " But you did n't run to me at once and apologize , " I said , with what must have been an annoying touch of irony . She refused the bait ( and I was relieved at that , for it had n't come out the way I had intended ) . She said , " No , I would n't have known where to find you , though it did occur to me I might get to you at the luncheon  --  as I did , you know . Meanwhile , I stayed there because Asimov amused me . Have you ever seen him sign autographs ? " " Yes , " I said unenthusiastically . She smiled . " He 's such a feckless lecher . Pants indiscriminately after every girl who shows up . An absolute democrat , who pays no attention to race , creed , color , age ? " " Or previous condition of servitude , " I said . " I know . I guess it is fun the first time you watch it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however innocent , into a heavy-handed double-entendre and manages it in so inoffensively self-delighted a way that somehow no one minds . He 's like a big puppy dog bouncing around and ? " I got her off the subject . " And you stayed there all the time till there was the fuss in connection with Giles ? "  | " Yes . And then I stayed on to the end because I was still feeling responsible for him and because I was afraid that something unpleasant might happen that would result in the kind of publicity that the hotel would not want " " You did n't hear him say anything about me during that time ? " " No . Not then . " " When did you hear it ? " " When the autographing session was over , he threw the pen he had been using against the wall . It hit and fell to the ground ? " " The red-ink pen ? " " I do n't know what kind it was , but he was clearly furious and perhaps out of control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people tried to stop him and talk to him , but he paid no attention . It seemed to me he was swaying and I was afraid he would collapse . My feeling of responsibility overcame me again so that I followed after him quietly , took his arm , and led him to the elevators . " " And what happened then ? " " As we were walking to the elevators , I asked him if he wanted to stop at the cloakroom for his package and he said , Too late . ' And then , in a kind of whisper , That Darius . That Darius Just . ' He said it with such hatred that it just chilled me . There was a homicidal edge to his voice , and even though he struck me as being a child , he 's such a physically large man and you 're so ? " " Small ? " I suggested when her hesitation had grown perceptible . She hurried on . " I felt you ought to be warned . " " But you did n't run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I told you , there was no way I could have found you then . Besides that , I had to take him up to his room . " " And what happened when you did that ? Did you leave him there ? Did you walk in with him ? What ? " Now she was in trouble . She took to shuffling some of the papers on her desk . Then she looked up and said , in a small voice , " I 've told you everything that 's important . " I said , " Why not just lie to me and tell me you took him to his room and walked away without entering "  | " How do you know that would be a lie ? " " Because I 've discovered things about Giles . We can be reasonably sure that he was left frustrated by the events of the night before , and there had been no relief since then . The failure to get the package , the fiasco at the autographing session , must all have accentuated the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to leave him in his room , you would n't have been able to . He took you by the arm , did n't he , and drew you in . And what could you do : he 's so large and you 're so  --  small . " She said miserably . " Yes , he drew me in . " " And once he had you in , he began to cry and then he asked you to undress him and give him a bath . " She looked me straight in the eye and said bitterly , " You know , then . You 've lived with him . Does he do it all the time ? And he 's never tried to get help ? " I shrugged . " My living with him has nothing to do with it . I just found out about this yesterday . And why should he get help ? If he finds a girl who does n't mind cooperating , who 's hurt ? " She did n't say anything and , after a few moments , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you cooperate ? " She rose from her chair so she could lean toward me and for the first time I saw her actively angry . " No , I did not . When he told me what he wanted , I left . " " You could n't have left , if he tried to stop you . " " He did n't try to stop me . I left quickly , in a hurry . I was near the door  --  and out . He could n't have moved fast enough to stop me . " " I see . " Sarah said thoughtfully , " I suppose that woman the night before had also refused . " " Yes , she had . " " And that 's it . " " Is it ? " I said . " You got him up to his room after the autographing session . Shall we say eleven-ten ? " " About that . " " And you came to the luncheon and warned me of Giles 's anger with me at about one o'clock , nearly two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you immediately . Did you expect me to wander about the hotel aimlessly , trying to meet you by chance ? " " What did you do during those two hours ? " " I was in my office . I had plenty to do . " " Who saw you there ? " " No one . My receptionist was out . It was Memorial Day , re-member ? " " You have no alibi . " " Why would I need one ? " Her eyes were fixed on mine and I could see the anger surge upward again . " Your story is unsupported , " I said . " Giles said he slept all that night and was not with a woman , and if he said so , as you reported he did , I would believe him . But I have only your report to that effect . I have only your report as to what happened before and what happened after the autographing session . You could be lying . " " Lying ? What do you imagine did happen ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging back on the couch , " but a dominating one . You run a department here with authority and you 're used to putting down large men . You may even like it . Now , here was a large man who wanted to be dominated . You might have stayed with him all night . Or , if not " ? I waved aside the beginning of an angry statement from Sarah ? " and I admit it sounds unlikely , then you might well have helped him out Monday morning , especially afterward . " Sarah was back in control . " Go on , " she said out of tight lips . " You said you had been feeling responsible for him all morning . You led him by the arm back to his room , felt sorry for him , and might even have enjoyed undressing him and bathing him . There 's no harm in it . Two consenting adults and all that . " " I see . And if so , what are you getting at ? " " Why , if so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I sat up suddenly , and said sharply , " What happened ? " And it was as though all the anger died in her at once and washed out . She laughed in complete good humor and said , " That 's funny . " Then she laughed again . I began to feel foolish . " What 's funny ? " " The way you did that . Sitting up suddenly like a schoolteacher  | who was going to trap me into saying something I did n't want to say . " " But you 're not answering . " She said , in total good nature , " Because there 's nothing to say . You do n't really believe I 'm lying . You 're just testing me and , I assure you , I pass . I brought him up about eleven-ten A.M. and it could n't have been much past eleven-fifteen when I left , eleventwenty at the outside . I left him there crying , poor fellow , but I assure you I had nothing more to do with him than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do have a little sadness over not having , perhaps , been a little kinder . When he tried to take his shower by himself , in his condition ? " " Everyone tries to be responsible , " I said querulously . " Now , look , are you certain now that when you left there were no clothes scattered about the room ? " " I tell you " ? and her usual precision of language became even more pronounced ? " that when I left he had his clothes on his body . Not one item had been removed . " " All right . Now , then , when you left , was anyone in the corri-dor ? " " No . " " Are you sure ? " " Quite sure . Look , Darius , I 've made love , you understand , and with a certain reasonable variety of technique , too , but this was something quite new and repellent to me and it was advanced by someone whom I found completely uninteresting , sexually , and I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have thought anything sexual could shock me . . . . Why are you looking like that at me , Darius ? Did you think I was a virgin ? I 'm thirty-two years old and have a seven-year-old son . " I spread out my hands . " Sorry . I had n't really thought of it at all . Except that your name fits your accent , so I thought you were unmarried . Of course , you could have married a fellow countryman , and your husband 's name ? " " Or I could be divorced and be working here under my maiden name . Is n't that possible , too ? "  | " Oh , is that it ? " " Does it matter ? Are you interested ? " I did n't really know what to say , so I settled for the truth . " No , it does n't matter , but I guess I 'm a little curious . " " I 'm divorced , " she said . " And your marital status ? " " I 'm single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never been married , though I guess it wo n't shock you if I tell you I 'm not a virgin either . " " I would n't have believed you if you had said you were , " she said ironically . " But let me explain how I know the corridor was empty . When I left Devore 's room , I felt somehow dirtied and I had an intense desire for no one to see me leave the room . I felt that too much , perhaps everything , could have been guessed from my appearance . " " Your clothes were mussed ? " " Do n't be foolish . It was a purely neurotic feeling . In any case , I did n't want anyone to see me and I took special note of the fact that no one did . There was no one in the corridor . " " No one at all ? " She hesitated . " Well , I did have the impression that there was a flash of movement in the direction of his room when I turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fearful apprehension . " " Anything more specific than just a flash of movement ? " " No . Since I did n't want to be seen , or worse yet , be caught by Devore if he was following me , I slipped down the staircase to the floor below and took the elevator there . " " Too bad , " I said . " Was there no impression of any kind other than the flash of movement ? Could you tell whether whatever you saw was large or small , man or woman ? " " No . Nothing . " " Too bad . If you did leave by eleven-twenty and if I found him dead two hours later , at which time he had been dead for some time , is n't it possible that the flash of movement you saw was of the murderer coming up to see Giles ? " " Goodness ! "
