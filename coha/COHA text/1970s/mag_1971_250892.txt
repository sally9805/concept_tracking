With his China initiative , the President is also taking some satirical fire from the right . William Loeb , publisher of the Manchester ( N.H. ) Union Leader and conservative thinker somewhat abaft of Coriolanus , regards the Peking trip with such horror that he instituted a reader contest to rename the President 's plane , now called The Spirit of ' 76 . That title , Loeb asserted , is totally inappropriate . <P> The contest winner was bland enough : Freedom 's Futile Flight . A few of the other , somewhat more imaginative entries : Red Airing ( second prize ) , Ping Pong Express , Tricky Dickie 's Chicken Ship , Neville Chamberlain Express , Yellow Bird , Judas Jet , Air Farce One , Asian Flew , DingALing Dickie 's Rickety Red Rickshaw and Go Mao , Pay Later .
