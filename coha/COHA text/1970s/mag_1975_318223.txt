During the past year or two , federal trustbusters have gone after some of the biggest names in U.S. business . Antimonopoly suits are now in various stages of litigation against several giants , including AT &T,; IBM , Firestone , Xerox and the big three in the rental-car field : Hertz , Avis and National . Last week the Justice Department turned its attention to some of the biggest banks and insurance companies , charging that they too are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws . <P> At issue are interlocking **25;3847;TOOLONG under which a director of one company serves simultaneously on the board of another . Interlocking directorates among competing firms have been forbidden since 1914 by Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act . Yet the Justice Department suspects that as many as 400 banks and insurance companies may share directors . Its two civil suits filed last week name the Prudential Insurance Company of America , in Newark , the nation 's largest insurance company , which has on its board a director of the San Francisco-based Bank of America , the largest U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The suits further named three directors of San Francisco 's Crocker National Bank , who also sit on the boards of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York ( MONY ) . The Justice Department charged that these arrangements are illegal . <P> The cases raise some questions of antitrust law . To begin with , the Clayton <P> Antitrust Act specifically prohibits sharing of directors between banks , but for 61 years it has been interpreted as not applying to links between the boards of banks and nonbanking firms . Now the Justice Department is saying that it does . To the defendants , this sudden new interpretation of the law seems very tenuous and unwarranted , and they intend to fight . Prudential refused to sign a consent order , and no company plans to fire its shared directors . <P> Another issue is an ancient one in antitrust law : under what circumstances can two companies be judged " competitors " ? To most of their customers , banks and insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their main businesses different but they make different types of investments . Insurance companies , for example , sometimes buy buildings , like the Landmark office complex in Atlanta , owned by MONY , a practice uncommon to banks . The Government nonetheless argues , with some justice , that banks and insurers do compete . Both make mortgage loans , and both manage pension funds . In making loans to corporations , banks have traditionally concentrated on loans of five years or less , insurance companies on loans of 15 years or more . Recently , however , both banks and insurance companies have been making more intermediate-term ( three-to ten-year ) loans .
