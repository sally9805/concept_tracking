In the 14 months since Poland 's pragmatic Party Boss Edward Gierek took power , the nation 's writers and intellectuals-reflecting the view of Poles in general-have found that it is possible to live with Gierek 's moderate regime . Stage Director Kazimierz Dej-mek has returned from exile and is again in favor ; he was disgraced in 1968 for putting on a heavily anti-Russian production of Patriot-Poet Adam Mickiewicz 's 19th century play Dziady , which included the line " The only things Moscow sends us are jackasses , idiots and spies . " Writer Stefan Kisie-lewski , who was severely beaten in 1968 for calling the government " a dictatorship of dimwits , " has been allowed under Gierek to travel abroad . Of the 939 books to be published this year , more than half are by contemporary authors , some of whom have not seen print in more than a decade . <P> Party 's Watchdogs . Last week , as delegates of the 1,130-member Polish Writers ' Union gathered in Lodz , Poland 's second largest city , they were clearly not inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously protested the cultural repression of Gierek 's predecessor , Wladyslaw Gomulka , and brought down the wrath of the regime . Jewish writers were particular targets ; Antoni Slonim-ski , a patriarch of contemporary Polish literature , was denounced by Gomulka as " not a proper Pole . " <P> This time , instead of overt defiance , the liberals concentrated on tactical victories and " a moderate , measured show of strength , " as Slonimski put it . The large Warsaw chapter of the union voted down most of the government slate of potential delegates , and sent a more independent and distinguished group to Lodz . At the convention , a total of seven liberals-including Zbigniew Herbert , Poland 's leading lyric poet-were elected to the 24-man executive committee that had previously been composed entirely of conservatives . Jerzy Putrament , who for 20 years has been the party 's politruk , or watchdog , within the union , was narrowly re-elected to the committee by a single vote-and only because some of his prominent opponents happened to be out of the hall at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government spokesmen went out of their way to be conciliatory . Zbigniew Zaluski , a leading conservative in the union , appealed for " a climate of trust between writers and the government . " The new Minister of Culture , Stanislaw Wronski , promised to improve the material conditions of writers , whose wages and royalties have not been increased since 1952 . <P> One issue on everyone 's mind was censorship . Even conservative union President Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz , 78 , complained that Poland 's broad censorship makes it impossible to deal with contemporary history . Liberal delegates did not attempt to press for total abolition of censorship . They agreed that Communist Party control in Poland must remain unquestioned , and - remembering the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia-tacitly accepted a ban on any works that would offend the Soviet Union . Instead , they set in motion machinery to make it more difficult for conservatives to expel writers from the union , and determined to press for more precise and less arbitrary censorship rules .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
