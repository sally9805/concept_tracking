Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has proclaimed 1976 as " The Year of Palestine , " and this week it begins in earnest . On Monday the United Nations Security Council is scheduled to begin debate on the Middle East situation . It is virtually certain that a large amount of the rhetoric will be devoted to the Palestinian problem-the plight of those Arabs who fled from the former British mandate of Palestine rather than live under Israeli rule . Although many have prospered , an estimated 644,093 still live in refugee camps in Lebanon , Syria , Jordan , the Occupied West Bank and Gaza . <P> Israel 's Arab enemies insist that a just solution of the issue include recognition of the Palestinians ' national rights as a people , and is essential to any peace settlement . At the Security Council debate , the pro-Palestinian arguments will for the first time be put forward not just by surrogates but by a representative of Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organization , probably its shadow " foreign minister , " Farouk Kaddoumi . <P> The U.S. and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was literally forced on them by the Syrians . Last November President Hafez Assad refused to extend the mandate of the U.N . Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan Heights unless the Council scheduled a review of the Middle East situation and allowed the P.L.O . to take part . The presence of the P.L.O . prompted an Israeli boycott of the Council session ; Premier Yitzhak Rabin 's Cabinet unanimously resolved " not to conduct negotiations with terrorist organizations in any forum . " A high Israeli official agreed that even " mentioning Palestinians makes them a political reality . " <P> Secure Boundaries . During the debate , the P.L.O . will push for revisions of Security Council Resolution 242 , adopted after the Six-Day War of 1967 and Resolution 338 , passed in the final days of the 1973 October War . These call for the " withdrawal of Israeli armed forces " from occupied territories and a recognition of the right of " every state in the area " to " live in peace with secure boundaries . " But they refer to the Palestinians only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.L.O. , backed by Syria and most Arab states , will try to amend the resolutions so they explicitly recognize the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination , independence and national sovereignty . <P> Too drastic a revision of Resolutions 242 and 338 , however , will almost certainly trigger a U.S. veto . " We would strongly oppose any attempt to change them , " Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned last week . The principal U.S. objective at the debate is to prevent the Security Council from becoming the main forum for future Middle East peace efforts . Washington is determined either to maintain the step-by-step diplomatic approach that so far has achieved two Israeli-Egyptian Sinai accords and one Israeli-Syrian agreement or to return to the Geneva Conference , jointly sponsored by the U.S. and the Soviet Union , which met briefly at the end of 1973.
