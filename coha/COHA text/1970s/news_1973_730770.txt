txt THERE WERE : 10 gal10 n s of flammable fluid ITask Force report Unknown to the seven famiIles living there , the corner building at 53d Street and Prairie Avenue , was a time bomb set to go off at 5 p. m. , ' Jan. 12 , 1972 . Richard Harris , the building janitor , and a tenant averted the disaster minutes before detonation . In pulling the electric timer 's plug from the wall he also aborted what insurance investigators say was one of the more callous and most careless of scores of arson-forprofit schemes they have dog-gedly tracked for years . Gilbert BalM , one of the city 's top slumlords and manager of the building , is now under investigation by a County A FOUR-MONTH Tribune Task Force investigation of slumlord operations has documented how unexplained fires strike buildings like these with incredible frequency , marking the final step in the pillaging of the slums . Abandoned or partly occupied tenements can generate one last financial killing . When the courts are threaten . ing severe action and the building has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonanza in insurance claims . The building at 5256 S. Prairie Av. was a slum nearing the end of the line . Most of the tenants had been evicted for nonpayment of rent , and the Building Department had sent notice of serious code violations just six days before the toaster bomb was planted . ? Victor Spector , operator of Spector Realty and another of Chicago 's top slumlords , had a $65,000 insurance policy on the , building . He denied any involvement in the attempted arson , but told fire investigators that an anonymous caller had warned Mrs. Harris to get out of the building three weeks before the bomb was discovered . POLICE REPORTS say a man posing as an exterminator was seen carrying six garbage containers presumably holding the flammable liquid up to the third floor of the building at 11 a. m. the day the bomb was discovered . The investigating officer also noted the remarkable similarity between this attempted arson and a fire that destroyed a Spector-owned building at 4446-48 S. Calumet Av. a year before . Witnesses told police that some containers holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " painters " three days before the fire . Spector 's $24,922 insurance claim was paid without question , because insurance investigators said they were unaware of the suspicious incidents preceding the blaze . Mysterious fires like these went virtually uninvestigated until recently , despite the fact that some slumlords were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fire insurance claims on scores of fires . The fire-insurance industry was caught in the same web the slumlords used to fool a grabbag of official agencies and the courts . They hid their ownership behind hundreds of secret trusts and scores of names  --  some of them fictitious . " THERE 'S absolutely no way of knowing ? how much they took the industry ( or when the ownership was concealed by land trusts and the names were phony , " said Clarence Reuter , chairman of the governing committee of the Ili linois Fair Plan , a federally regulated fire-insurance pool for ghetto areas . After the Fair Plan was set up in Illinois in 1968 , the processing of insurance applications and claims in ghetto areas was consolidated under one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice strange coincidences . ' They noticed that a lion 's share of the insurance claims were collected by a very small group of people , none of whom lived in the ghetto . " The problem came from a very small group of mostly absentee landlords who wanted to get out from under a mortgage , " Rauter said . " We 're the last resort for people who find that properties are of no economic value . " One of the absentee slumlords the Fair Plan is watching is Louis Wolf , who bought and built a commerical mall in the heart of New Town with help from more than half a million dollars in fire-insurance claims he was paid in the sixties , investigators said . THEY JOKINGLY call his empire of boutiques and bars in the 2800 block of North Broadway " Lou 's Piece of the Rock . " Another absentee landlord is Wolf 's childhood friend , Albert Berland , a convicted Federal Housing Administration swindler who has owned more than 300 Lawndale properties and collected more than $270,000 in fire-insurance claims during an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a known " torch man or suspected torch man , " has admitted there have been more than 47 fires in his buildings . Fair Plan finally arched its back and refused to pay Wolf , Berland , or their associates . All told , they are now fighting 10 suits for $239,157 in fire claims . Since the organization started fighting the slumlords in court , an additional $300,000 in fire claims have been withdrawn , officials said . One of these was a $58,000 claim filed by Balin and his attorney , Moe Forman , for two fires in a building at 3218 W. Maypole Av .. they had purchased for $2,000 . Cases in court in which Fair Plan has charged arson and fraud include : ? A PRECEDENT-setting civil case now being appealed in which a jury refused Berland 's bid for a $34,177 fire claim . Witnesses testified in Federal Court that they saw Wolf and another man enter the Berland-owned 12-flat at 715-17 S. Lawndale Av. on November 19 , 1969 , carefully carrying buckets and a ladder . The pair left shortly after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune inquiries prompted the state 's attorney 's office to subpena federal trial records for criminal charges . ? A $60,000 claim was made by Wolf in his sister 's name after a March , 1970 , fire devastated the building he had purchased three years before for $3,500 . The fire came after a futile five-year city effort to get the building repaired or demolished . ? Two suits seeking $44,000 filed by Florida Jenkins , owner of Pulaski Realty , who has managed slum buildings for Wolf and Berland in sworn statements denied having any business associations with them . In both cases she still owed more than half the original purchase prices of $5,200 and $6,000 when fires destroyed the buildings . IN ADDITION she has filed claims totaling more than $25 , - 000 for four fires that occurred in three of her buildings at the rate of one a month thru March . Demolition suits were pending in Housing Court at the time . One blaze killed two children . ? BALIN FILED suit to collect $60,000 in insurance for a 1970 fire loss on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,200 in 1967 . The building was hit by at least nine other fires while Balin owned it  --  five in the month that preceded the final blaze . Balin was facing a certain contempt-of-court order for failing to correct code violations , and tenants were with , holding rent at the time of the last fire . Spector was not BalM 's only client to suffer a heavy incidence of fires . In a 1970 deposition Balin told interrogators that he had 30 to 40 fires over a five-year span in buildings he managed . In the case of one client , he said , " every building I managed for them had a fire . " ONE SPECTOR suit seeking a $113,000 insurance claim was settled for $10,000 after the company threatened to fight tile case by arguing that Spector 's management of the building had increased the fire hazard there . I At the time of the 1970 fire , the 28-unit tenement had only two tenants and was in need of major repairs . Its history of serious fire and health hazards under Spector 's ownership dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a milestone in the three-year Fair Plan investigative effort that has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . It has been an uphill battle . When they began writing policies in 1968 , Fair Plan was swamped with hundreds of applications a day . It had no staff , and there was statutory pressure to approve policies and claims quickly . In addition , the new federally regulated program was " a nevernever land of insurance , " as one official put it , with procedures that will take " another 10 years to iron out . " AMONG THOSE clamoring at their doors then and now were the city 's top slumlords . They had a well-rehearsed repertoire of time-proven tricks and disguises they used to ob-tain policies without arousing suspicion and unwanted investigations . BalM , Wolf , and Berland masqueraded behind a battery of phony and real names of friends , relatives , and business associates . They even submitted some applications and mortgages signed by nonexistent people and notarized by a corpse . Reporters found at least 20 insurance applications or mortgages , mostly on Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf 's old friend , Maurice H. Blumenthal , long after Blumenthal was killed in a car crash . His signature was penned in a variety of hands , and was even misspelled once . Slumlords also frequently lie on their insurance applications when asked about previous fire histories , because a truthful answer would result in a more than cursory look at the applicant , officials said . Berland , for example , used a phony name in his insurance application for the Lawndale building , and said he had no fire history . He admitted to 27 fires when questioned under oath after the building burned down . TODAY THERE are 62,000 Illinois Fair Plan policies , a staff of 53 people to keep track of them , and " still not enough time or money or people to investigate applications  --  we ca n't do anything until after the loss , " Rauter said . As a result of its get-tough policy , Fair Plan here has been able to reduce its fire-insurance premiums by 20 per cent , but its e f f or t s are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious slum fires to a kid 's prank or a bum 's effort to keep warm . Incredibly , officials of the fire and police departments claim they have no evidence indicating the existence of any widespread burn - for - profit scheme . " All the people in the neighborhoods say everything is arson , " said George Schueler , chief of the Fire Department Bureau of Investigations . " It 's the vandals , and the kids , and the winos . I doubt very much that there is a conspiracy to burn buildings down . " However , insurance investigators claim they can practically predict when a fire will occur , depending on who the owner is and whether the building is in trouble on a demolition suit . " What has a demolition order got to do with it ? " asked Lt. Edward Neville , head of the police Bomb and Arson Unit . FAIR PLAN officials also say they are hampered by a host of federal regulations that make it difficult to deal with slumlords . " The Fair Plan was set up under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities who were not afforded equal opportunities to own property and obtain insurance in declining areas , " a spokesman said . " No one anticipated the potential abuses . " Rauter mentioned several regulations that practically invite arson : ? Fair Plan must insure a hovel in the worst neighborhood in Chicago for the same amount it would be insured for if it were located in Kenilworth . Records show slumlords have taken advantage of this regulation , sometimes insuring buildings for 20 to 30 times what they paid , when " they are n't worth anything unless you burn them , " Ranter said . ? They must give 30 days notice before canceling a policy , " plenty of time for a slumlord to get the tenants and salvage out and arrange for a fire , " Rauter said . A building bought had htby Louis Wolf for $ a $30,000 fire eight days after Fair Plan notified him of cancellation . FAIR PLAN complaints leave federal insurance administrator George K. Bernstein cold . He called them " a typical buck-passing response , " but conceded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're not going to deny insurance to the deserving 99.9 per cent of our policy-holders for whom this is the only game in town , " he said . " You listen to the insurance industry and you 'd think all the people we insure are aronsists . We do not subsidize slumlords. "
