Measured by the rate at which production will rise , the U.S. economy 's recovery from its worst slump since the 1930s will be swift . But business has fallen to such low levels , and has so far to climb back , that even a vigorous upturn will leave unemployment dismayingly high through 1976 . That is the consensus of members of TIME 'S Board of Economists , who assembled in Manhattan last week to discuss , among other key issues , the probable course of the nation 's bounce back from recession . Board Member Arthur Okun sums up : " The rate of growth in the economy is going to be sensational , but the level of operation is going to be lousy . " <P> Slower Slump . To a man , the economists agree that the recession is nearing its end-although the rebound is not yet at hand . Production will probably continue drifting down through the spring , making the current quarter the sixth straight in which output has declined . Underscoring that prediction , the Government reported last week that industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked slowdown from the 1.3% decline in March . <P> The board members believe that the long-awaited upturn should begin this summer and accelerate smartly after that . During the fourth quarter , most expect real gross national product-output of goods and services , discounted for inflation-to rise at an annual rate of 6% to 7% . For the whole of 1976 , a majority of board members predict that production will increase by 6% or more . Okun believes that real G.N.P . will increase at a hefty 8% rate during the first twelve months of the rebound . <P> Even that rapid a rise in production would still leave the economy operating well below its capacity . IBM Vice President David Grove figures that real G.N.P . this year will run 15% below what it could be if the economy used its resources of plant , materials and manpower to full potential . The gap between actual and potential output , he calculates , will shrink only to 13% next year , and even to 11% by 1977 . At its peak , in the third quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity . <P> The worst consequence : the jobless rate , now 8.9% of the work force , will go on rising for a few more months and will come down slowly after that . Most board members expect a peak of about 9.5% . Robert Nathan guesses that it could hit 10%-and predicts that the unemployment rate will not go below 8% any time next year . Other board members are slightly more optimistic ; Otto Eckstein forecasts a jobless rate of 7.7% by the end of 1976 . Even that would mean that after a year and a half of recovery , the unemployment rate would be as severe as it was at the bottom of the worst previous post-World War II recession , in 1958.
