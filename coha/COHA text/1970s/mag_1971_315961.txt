After a costly ten-week strike last fall , the United Auto Workers won an immediate 13% wage increase from General Motors and then turned on Chrysler , which yielded similar raises , including a 13% pay boost for several thousand white-collar workers . <P> Last week officers of the U.A.W. in Detroit found themselves in a painful role reversal . Around Solidarity House , the U.A.W. headquarters , 350 of the union 's own hirelings , members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ' s Office and Professional Employees International Union , had thrown a picket line , demanding that the U.A.W. cough up the same 13% raise that it had won for the auto workers . <P> It mattered little that the office workers already earn between $188 and $196 per week-compared to $191 for most auto workers-and that the U.A.W. was offering a weekly increase of $8.05 . <P> " They want more than the people who pay them , " complained U.A.W. Secretary-Treasurer Emil Mazey . The most traumatic part of it came when the U.A.W. men had to cross the picket line to enter Solidarity House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Christian Temperance Union throwing a cocktail party . The scene suggested facing mirrors-unions within unions , strikes within strikes , Joe Hill Jr . picketing his old man . And just how well is the Office Employees Union paying its hired help ?
