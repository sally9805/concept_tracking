A slot machine for blood pressure <P> Jeanette Williams , 73 , a San Francisco housewife , used to see her doctor every week to make sure she was winning her battle against hypertension , or high blood pressure . Now she merely stops by a shopping center near her home , where she consults a curious-looking machine that resembles an armrest-equipped chair in a college lecture hall . Taking a seat , Mrs. Williams rolls up her sleeve , puts her arm into a vinyl cuff , deposits 50 in the slot and pushes a button . On the console in front of her , the words light up , TESTING-REMAIN STILL . The vinyl cuff tightens noticeably around her arm . Moments later her blood pressure flashes on the screen . <P> The robot blood-pressure machine - or sphygmomanometer-that has sharply reduced Mrs. Williams ' dependence on her physician is one of the latest marvels of medical technology . Introduced in 1976 by Vita-Stat Inc. of Tierra Verde , Fla. , and now produced by other firms as well , the coin-operated gadgets have appeared in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospital lobbies across the country . They are not only cheap and fast -a reading takes a little more than a minute-but impressively accurate . Comparing their results with those obtained by conventional means , Dr. Joseph Chadwick , director of the health-systems program at SRI International ( formerly the Stanford Research Institute ) in Menlo Park , Calif , concluded that the machines are " more consistent than a well-trained blood-pressure technician . " <P> Like ordinary sphygmomanometers , they work by measuring the surge of arterial blood that occurs immediately after the tightened cuff is slightly released . The major difference is that the precise moment of maximum flow , when the heart is pumping hardest-represented by the upper , or systolic , blood pressure-and that of minimum flow , or diastolic reading , are not determined by a doctor or technician listening for the coursing blood with a stethoscope pressed against the forearm . Instead , that job is done by a tiny microphone in the cuff , which sends its signals to the machine 's miniature " brain " - tiny silicon chips or microprocessors . Programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine when to pump up and deflate the cuff , but also determine the exact time for taking the two readings . If there are any disturbing outside sounds or arm movements , Vita-Stat 's machine flashes three zeros on the screen and refunds the customer 's money . <P> By referring to a chart fixed to the machine , users can tell whether their blood pressure is outside the normal range for their age . If so , that should be prodding enough for them to seek medical counsel . Hypertension is probably the leading cause of death in the U.S. , yet can be easily treated , even in its most severe forms ( TIME cover , Jan. 13 , 1975 ) . <P> For those who are already under treatment , like Jeanette Williams , the machine is an enormous convenience . Says her husband Eric , 74 : " It 's easy to use , easy to read , and we have confidence in it . " -                   @ @
