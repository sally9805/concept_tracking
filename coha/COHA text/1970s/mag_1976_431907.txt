 | Betty FordTalks about Homemaking A former working girl who 's now a full-time wife and mother , the First Lady know that life at home can be just as liberating as an outside career . By Winzola McLendon Betty Ford , who has been so outspoken in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and legalized abortion , is equally as forthright in her defense of a woman 's right to be a full-time wife and mother . " We have to take the just ' out of just a housewife ' and show our pride in having made the home and family our life 's work , " she says . " What 's this about the liberated woman being a career woman ? " the First Lady also asks . Then answers , " A liberated woman is one who feels confident in herself and is happy in what she is doing . A woman who is satisfied with her life at home is just as liberated as a woman with a career outside the home . " " What is important , " Mrs. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide the direction of her own life and that she makes that decision herself , without pressures restricting her choice . " As First Lady , Betty Ford is very concerned about the lack of appreciation for the role of women as homemakers ? a word she likes better than housewife " because that 's what you are doing , making a home . " It 's a concern she shares with her hush .. - Earlier this year , President Ford told a grou Future Homemakers of America , " I regret that people in this country have disparaged and meaned the role of the homemaker . . homemak is not out of date and I reject such accusations : Betty puts it another way , " Homemakers are backbone of our society . They 're the ones ' , influence young people . Family culture is the v , beginning of everything . " Sitting in the family quarters of the White Hon recently , Mrs. Ford discussed her own role as homemaker and compared it with the years s spent earning her own living ? first as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and later as a fashion coordinator for a departme : store in her hometown of Grand Rapids , Mich . We met early in the day and she was wearing floor-length , crisp , white cotton hostess gown . Slit : and handsome ( someone once called her the think ing man 's Rita Hayworth ) , Betty 's chestnut ha : - was softly waved and her makeup understated , th , way John Robert Powers continued on page ? ( 24  | taught her when she was one of his models . The First Lady feels she 's had the best of two worlds ? a career she loved and never thought she 'd leave . and a wonderful life as a homemaker who has raised four different , very independent children . " Personally , I highly recommend marrying and having a family , " she says . " I think I would have missed something if I had n't been a homemaker . The satisfaction of a happy marriage and raising children is almost more fulfilling than a career . " But did n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to seek help from a psychiatrist to pull her through many difficult years ? The First Lady explains that it was n't homemaking itself that caused her problems . It was having the home and raising four vivacious children almost singlehandedly . As a congressman with ambitions of becoming Speaker of the House , Jerry Ford spent as many as 200 nights a year away from home , making speeches and campaigning ? for himself or other Republicans . Mrs. Ford was left at home to take care of everything . She did n't dislike doing it , she . just did n't like doing it alone . " I had to make all the decisions , without help , " she recalls . " And since I believe that discipline should be done at the moment and when Dad gets home , ' I was sole disciplinarian . Also , my chi were very active and I was overly concerned about their health and welfare . " She chooses her words carefully and her blue-gray eyes are serious as she explains , " I believe that a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of , say , 18 to 20 years . If you have n't created the best in the child by then , I think it is too late . " My mother , who was a great inspiration to me , always said if you are going to do something , do it well or do n't do it at all . I believe that . Today , if I am going to make speech or do anything ? maybe give a State Dinner ? I give it all I 've got . " I enjoyed building my home . I loved every minute of it , I really did . I should n't say every minute . There were some difficult times . But I loved being a homemaker . " Mrs. Ford arrived in Washington D.C. , in 1949 , as the bride of a newly elected congressman . I did n't miss the career she had 1 behind in Grand Rapids because the Capitol was new to her and she spent : a great deal of time on Capital Hill , " in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . She a. that she did n't know much government before that . Often Congressman Ford worked ir . office on weekends , she went @# f ? vz //hGttti  | and did his filing . And , when important visitors from their home state came to Washington , it was usually Betty who showed them around town . She also continued her dancing , taking lessons once or twice a week . ( She still dances for exercise every morning , alone in her White House bedroom ? " where no one can see me " ? but she stopped her lessons about 10 years ago after developing a pinched nerve in her neck . ) Unlike many young wives , Betty Ford did n't have problems adjusting to housekeeping . While working as a dancer and living in New York 's Greenwich Village , she had her own apartment and she had also been married before . ( It was a marriage , she once said , she could have " easily skipped . " ) So cleaning and cooking were n't new to her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother supplied me with some nice recipes ? I still use them . She gave me a lot of shortcuts . " One was using leftover mashed potatoes to make a sophisticated vichyssoise . Another was cooking " fried " chicken in the oven instead of on top of the stove in hot oil . ( The oven method eliminated the need to stand and watch a pot . ) Later , when the Fords had a house , with a backyard swimming pool , there were outdoor barbecues . Betty smiles and notes , " Then Jerry could do the steaks or hamburgers and hot dogs . The most exciting thing in our lives was when our first child , Mike , was born ( in 1950 ) . Both Jerry and I had been anxious to have a family , although I was apprehensive about him and how he would adjust to fatherhood . He 'd been a bachelor for 35 years and I was n't sure he was going to be able to take babies . But I do n't know a prouder father than he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . " Her own joy in that baby , and those who followed , is obvious as she tells about the years when her children were young . She remembers how she kept her babies in her own bedroom until they were strong enough to lift their heads and move about ? she 'd heard about infants smothering in their cribs , so she wanted hers near ? where she co ' . " hear every sound . " She breast all her children and recalls h : Jerry would get up at two A.M. and bring the baby to her . If a ba. awakened early , they had a " neat trick " that enabled them to get ext rest ? " Jerry would put this litt bitty thing on his chest on its lift ; tummy , and just the breathing movement of his chest would quiet down the baby . Here was th:s great big broad-shouldered guy , with this tiny thing on his chest ! It let us get an extra hour of sleep. ? Two years after Mike 's birth , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year later . BA this time the Fords had moved fro : - their Georgetown apartment to a home in Alexandria , Va . And t : - . Congressman , as he gained mot. , and more seniority , had become more and more involved in political affair , which kept him away from home . Betty was active in the Congressional Wives Club , especially with a group working with children it : a local hospital . She helped in PTA fund-raising projects , and was or .. of the " doers " in her church guild She taught Sunday school and made sure her four children were bap-28  | tized and had religious instruction the Episcopal Church . She was a den mother to a Boy Scout . troop . " I had them once a week , - se very , very active little boys , " recalls . " I would take them out 1 we 'd play leapfrog and I 'd do cartwheels and stand on my head , . n teach them how . They were azed ! They could n't believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up head.ads because of her problems with neck . Her children were encouraged to ag friends home and their house . s furnished informally , so that . ryone , including children , could oy every room . She remembers ne of her children 's friends not ng allowed in their own living ) ms because the rooms were " too elborately done in white carpeting something . " The Fords ' backyard , too , was a gathering place for neighborhood children . It was also a mini-zoo at tes , housing all kinds of pets , incling alligators and snakes . ( Betty once found a snake in her bathsm . ) Playing games with her kids , she insists , was relaxing . She also feels it 's important to be home when your children come in from school . " They have so much to tell you and to share with you and it 's the sharing that is so important . They must know that you care and that you are interested in what they did that day . " Weekends were always reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good about not taking speaking engagements when he knew one of the boys was playing high school football . He wanted to be there to cheer his kids on . There were also two-week vacations every winter at Vail , Colo. , where the whole family skied together . We wanted each individual child to develop his own personality . We did n't want them to be lawyers because Jerry was a lawyer , or to be dancers because I was a dancer , " she says . " It worked , because they have all gone off in their own directions . I think that is great . To Jerry and me it is a tribute that we were not overbearing in influencing their lives . Yet , we tried to advise them . " For all the joys she found in motherhood , Betty Ford does n't advocate it for every woman . " There are women who can have fulfilling lives without being mothers . Some women are n't particularly suited to raising children . " Just as there are some women , she thinks , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she believes everyone should have the option of working or not working , without being criticized or discriminated against . The First Lady recognizes the low status of the homemaker in today 's society and would like to find ways to raise it . She believes that some sort of monetary value should be placed on a homemaker 's contribution to the running of her household perhaps benefits , such as those given by Social Security . " There should absolutely be some financial consideration , other than her husband 's , " she says . Half in jest , she adds , " He may take off and marry a young chick . It happens . " If a price should be put on homemaking , Betty would certainly make it higher than that of a recent study which placed a housewife 's average monetary value at $5,750 per year . ( The study was conducted by the Social Security 's Office of Research and Statistics . ) Homemakers are worth at least $30,000 continued on page 35 @#  | annually , says Mrs. Ford , who points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursemaid , cleaning woman , doctor ( " A mother is the one who looks after the health " ) and chauffeur . She was relieved when her children turned 16 and could finally drive . though her husband recently vetoed a child-care bill , Betty thinks it might be helpful to have a " good " day-care center where homemakers might occasionally leave their small children , freeing them to pursue some . things of their own . " Women want to be active in their communities , " she says . " Some of them relate to volunteer service with the hospital , the church or involvement ; fine arts . This is fulfillment for every women . " Having a place where they could leave their children . for a few hours a week , would free women for such things . When the Ford children were small Betty was " blessed with a very beautiful woman " who helped raise Mike and Jack and Steve and Susan . " I had her for 20 years , " she says , " and I think our success was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were adjustable . When the babies were little , her hours were longer , and when they were older , hours were shorter . " When asked if she would be disappointed if her daughter , Susan , passed up a career in favor of homemaking , Betty laughs and exclaims , " I would n't be disappointed at al , but I ca n't imagine it ! " ( At 18 , Susan has already earned money as a baby-sitter , newspaper photographer a fashion model . ) Addressing the same question seriously , Betty says , " I would go right along with her if that was what she wanted . But I Id encourage her to have a career , something she could do to support herself if she had to fall back on it . How does a girl know how her marriage will turn out ? Also the husband could have an accident and the wife might have to go out and be the family breadwinner . " Actually , what Betty Ford wants for her daughter is the same thing she wants for all women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right decide if she wants a career out of the home or in the home .
