Sugarman reported yesterday . No check , he said , was fore , more than $100 , and the aver-1 age was $75 . The Administrator noted quickly that since Jan. 1 his agency had " recouped " almost $500,000 from the recipients and expected to get back $1-million more within six months . Mr. Sugarman said that regardless of the alleged illegal acts no destitute person could be dropped from the welfare rolls . He made the report at s joint news conference , with Commissioner of Investigation ' Robert K Ruskin to announce the filing of criminal charges against 13 welfare recipients . The 13 were charged with perjury , filing false instruments and larceny in obtaining replacement checks for ones they swore had been lost or stolen . This was the first time , Mr. Ruskin said , that felony charges had been made in such cases . ) If convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . They were accused of illegally obtaining from one to nine replacement checks that totaled almost $4,000 . In the past , Mr. Ruskin explained , misdemeanor charges were brought and in almost all instances tile defendants were freed by the courts . He said he hoped that the new approach in filing felony changes would bring prison sentences and act as a deterrent . Just prior to the conference at Mr. Ruskin 's office at 1 John Street , State Senator Roy M. Goodman , Manhattan Republican , charged that an " imbecilic breakdown of administration " in the H.R.A. 's Department of Social Services had wrecked the new slate law designed to employ persons 00 welfare . There are I.2 million relief recipients in the city , anti the city announced Wednesday that // it was seeking to employ 13,000 of them . At a City Hall news conference earlier , Mr. Goodman contended that his investigation showed that about 75 per cent of referrals from the Social Services Department to the State Employment Service involved sending applicants to offices that were inappropriate for medical or occupational reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards be issued to each welfare client to reduce fraudulent check-cashing , but that 55 per cent did not have proper cards and 45 per cent had no cards at all . He held that Mr. Sugarman " mist be held directly responsible " for " a case of idiotic , imbecilic breakdown of administration . " Mr. Sugarman promptly denied the charges , contending that Mr. Goodman 's facts were incorrect . Mr. Sugarman said that the department was moving " with great speed " to comply with new state regulations . " Mistakes are inevitable " at that pace , he said , adding that he was " satisfied that we are making progress " toward eliminating confusion . At the joint news confer ence , Mr. Sugarman said that since last summer a total of 156,000 welfare checks were replaced after the originals were reported lost or stolen . Of the 156,000 checks , he said , 40,000 , worth about $4-million , became suspect . After investigation , 3,000 were turned over to the agency 's legal department . Ultimately , the legal department referred 800 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare frauds . Several months ago , Mr. Ruskin explained , the cases involving the 13 welfare defendants were referred to his office by Mr. Sugarman. - He said the evidence was then turned over to handwriting experts of the Police Department 's crime laboratory before formal charges were made . Mr. Ruskin said that the charges were made against the 13 because in each instance the original check was cashed before the replacement . He admitted a legal loophole in cases of persons who cashed the original welfare checks : after they had cashed the replacements . In this instance , he explained , the criminal case for perjury was too weak to pursue , but the H.R.A. could move in Civil Court to collect the overpayment . This was the case involving 15,000 recipients from whom the city ' expects to get back $1-million in - the next six months . In many instances , Mr. Sugarman said , . the recipient , after being interviewed , admitted the illegality and agreed to pay back the funds . The . recoupment program Mr. Sugarman said , is contrary to Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area . Until it is challenged successfully in the court the program will continue , he added . Under the program , money is deducted from welfare checks from four to six times every other week over a six-month period until the city has been paid back in full .
