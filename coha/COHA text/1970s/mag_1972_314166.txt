Since World War II , Government secrecy has developed into a pervasive bureaucratic habit , an ominous development for a system of , by and for the people . It reached the point where Defense Department subalterns were classifying newspaper clippings , administrators used their SECRET stamps to conceal waste and stupidity , and the vaults of Washington were choked with millions of pages of momentous or banal information that the public was paying millions of dollars a year for the privilege of never seeing . <P> Last week , after more than a year 's review of Government secrecy , the White House overhauled the classification procedures for the first time since 1953 . Not that the Government is exactly throwing open its filing cases . The President reduced the number of officials authorized to classify from 5,100 to 1,860 . At the other end of the process , the minimum time for automatic declassification of low-sensitivity papers was cut from eight years to six , and most papers will be automatically declassified in ten years . <P> Nixon said that he wants an " open " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he declared , " is the belief that when information which properly belongs to the public is systematically withheld by those in power , the people soon become ignorant of their own affairs , distrustful of those who manage them . " But with a six-year limit on classification , the Administration he was declaring open was Lyndon Johnson 's . <P> The new executive order raised an intriguing question : Would the classification of the Pentagon papers have been " legal " under the new rules ? Perhaps . Some of the six-year-old material in the papers could have been acquired by the public without breaking the law , but even that is in doubt , since the study , which dealt with national security , would have required special clearance in any case .
