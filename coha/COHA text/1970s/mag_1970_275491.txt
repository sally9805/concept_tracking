WE are both relieved and delighted that Correspondent Robert Anson has been released after 21 days as a captive of anti-government forces in Cambodia . Fifteen pounds lighter , thanks to the largely rice diet , but none the worse for wear , Anson arrived early last week in Phnom-Penh , where he was soon reunited with his wife Diane . From there , the couple flew to Saigon for a festive gathering with members of the Saigon bureau and Time-Life News Service Chief Murray Gart , who flew in from Europe via Tashkent . Gart arrived with champagne , a tin of caviar and a bottle of vodka , which formed the first course of a feast that lasted well into the night , as Anson set about regaining some of those lost pounds . He reports on his experience in this week 's World section . <P> One would suspect the marriage rare in which both partners rise to worldwide prominence . Yet this week 's cover story on Actor Elliott Gould marks the 42nd occasion that both a husband and wife , either current or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gould 's estranged wife , Barbra Streisand , was featured in the April 10 , 1964 issue . <P> In most cases , the couples have made it for their individual news value , not for something they did , or did not do , as a family . Britain 's Queen Elizabeth has been on the cover five times , more than any other woman , but never with Prince Philip , who made it once in his own right . Between them , Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were reported in twelve cover stories ( she in four and he in eight ) , but they too never appeared together . All told , only 14 couples have been featured together , led by Generalissimo and Madame Chiang Kaishek , who were pictured twice . Jacqueline Kennedy was a solo cover subject as First Lady , and also with Husas First Lady , and also with Husbands John F. Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis . Some other famous pairs were Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton , Luci Baines Johnson and Pat Nugent , and Lynn Fontanne with Alfred Lunt. - <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of New York Bureau Correspondent Mary Cronin , who spent several days interviewing Gould at his Greenwich Village home . She also talked with Gould 's mother Lucille . Researcher Patsy Beckert added further insight by interviewing his father , Bernard Goldstein , and people from his early show business days . West Coast Correspondents David Whiting and Martin Sullivan rounded out the report to Jay Cocks , who wrote the finished story , and Peter Bird Martin , who edited it . <P> The Cover : Color drawing by Milton Glaser.
