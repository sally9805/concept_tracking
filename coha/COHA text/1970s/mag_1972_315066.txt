For all its political appeal , President Nixon 's proposed busing moratorium raises troubling questions for the nation 's educators . Since 1954 they have been guided by the U.S. Supreme Court 's historic ruling that " separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . " Last month , amid the latest uproar over busing , Nixon proposed that Congress prohibit new busing and concentrate $2.5 billion on improving inferior schools . Apart from constitutional dilemmas , the Nixon stand immediately reopened two hard questions : <P> &gt; Can substantial school integration be achieved without more busing ? <P> &gt; Can racially separate schools be made equal at any price ? <P> To be sure , Nixon did not rule out all busing . About 40% of U.S. schoolchildren would continue riding the ubiquitous yellow machines , most for reasons of distance , not race . Thus a city like Boston , which sends 85% of its students to high school by bus or public transportation and maintains de facto school segregation ( TIME , April 3 ) , probably could integrate with no increase in busing-not that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school could balance schools racially by following the example of Westfield , N.J. , which integrated its schools simply by reassigning blacks to white schools and hiring three new crossing guards to get them there safely . But Boston and Westfield are hardly typical . New Jersey education authorities , for example , estimate they could racially balance schools in 36 districts without new busing , but they could not do so in the 15 largest cities , where up to three-fourths of the state 's nonwhite schoolchildren live . The situation is similar in other densely populated states . <P> But this new busing would not necessarily mean the " massive busing " that most Americans assume integration would require ; increasing evidence demonstrates that it is needed only in rare cases . One study , by HEW 'S Office for Civil Rights , found that 19 districts operating in 1970-71 under court orders to integrate had to increase the number of pupils bused to school by only 9% . <P> Another , financed by HEW and released after Nixon spoke , found that substantial integration-even in large cities like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busing would be necessary . That study , by the Lambda Corp. , a technical research firm in Arlington , Va. , assumed that no school-bus trip should take more than 35 minutes after the last child is picked up . The Lambda report also assumed that existing school-district lines would be retained , except in cities where a white majority in the city schools could be achieved only by exchanging students with nearby suburbs. * Even then , little new busing would be required . Researchers fed census figures , road maps , busing schedules and other data into a computer . They found , says Project Director George E. Pugh , that " in most cases where the courts ordered desegregation , people put together plans that were highly inefficient , involving more busing than was necessary . "
