Television 's bionic twosome , Steve Austin and Jaime Sommers , seemed made for each other-literally . Like Steve , she had been rebuilt with superhuman powers by space-age engineers . Sure enough , when she made some try-out appearances on ABC 's Six Million Dollar Man last year , Austin 's all-seeing artificial eye nearly popped out of his head . Who could blame him ? Jaime looked smashing , and as Steve 's blood pressure climbed , so did the show 's ratings . Explains willowy Lindsay Wagner , who plays Jaime : " Viewers tuned in to see whether passion could flow between two people who were part Timex . " So many did so , in fact , that Jaime was spun out of Steve 's life for a series of her own . <P> Hot Entry . By the numbers , at least , this forced separation has been a success . Since The Bionic Woman first appeared in mid-January it has become , along with ABC 's sitcom Laverne and Shirley , the TV season 's hottest late entry . Big with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has also drawn a sizable adult audience stuck on Lindsay Wagner 's sexy looks . Her show has consistently been among the top 15 in the ratings , although Majors ' program often edges it out by a point or two . <P> Wagner plays a latter-day Wonder Woman who became the world 's first bionic woman after she was nearly killed in a skydiving accident ; doctors rebuilt her , piece by voluptuous piece , with 80-m.p.h. legs , a right arm that can shatter trees and an ear capable of hearing leaves rustle in the next county . Between classes at a military base in Ojai , Calif. , where she is a schoolteacher , she moonlights as an intelligence agent . <P> Unlike Steve Austin , who regularly uses his brawn to brain villains , Jaime seldom uses her strength to do more than defensively trip or trick her opponents . ABC also seems to have decided that she can get along without a coherent plot . The typical show seems to be a collection of barely related episodes intended mainly to display Jaime 's powers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; uses her foot to brake an out-of-control car ; leaps onto a second-story fire escape to avoid danger . <P> The Bionic Woman 's most impressive feat may have been the deal she wrung out of Universal , the show 's producer . Her contract gives her $500,000 a year for five years , a guarantee of one film role annually and 12% of the take from sales of Bionic dolls , T shirts and other spinoffs , which her agent insists could total as much as $2 million . Only last fall , Wagner , 26 , was having trouble at Universal , which decided not to renew a $50,000-a-year contract she then had with the studio . Although she was considered " promising , " her credits included only a few mixed-review films ( Two People , The Paper Chase ) and occasional one-shot appearances on TV shows . ABC vetoed her for a TV movie role because she was not well known .
