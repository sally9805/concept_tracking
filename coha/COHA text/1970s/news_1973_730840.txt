txt As the Watergate pressure on the President intensifies ? with John Dean III now on the docket of the Senate-probe and John Mitchell due next ? the Democratic leader in the Senate has moved strongly behind Mr. Nixon . Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield says flatly : " I do not think that the President was involved . " In an interview , the Montana Senator also said that he envisioned Watergate ending up as , a " boon " for both the presidency and for the American people as a whole . " I think , " he said , " that the foundation on which deinocracy rests may well become stronger as the result of what is being laid before the American people at this time . " Mr. Mansfield takes the position - that- Watergate , instead-of-destroying the President , has forced him to correct the  --  imhala ; nce  --  in  --  power  --  in -- Washington , where he had assumed I too much and taken too much away ! from Congress . In the readjustment , Mr. Mansfield sees the President gaining , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calling for a " regeneration of ethics , a restoration of old-time morality and renewed dedication to the American system , " Senator Mansfield said new enforceable laws were needed to regulate political campaigning . The shock of Watergate will bring the new law soon , he said . The Senator said the facts as they are laid out would eventually have to speak for themselves . " One can not render a judgment on hearsay , or make a judgment this early , " he said . " But I do ' not think that the President was involved . I have no knowledge to that effect . Under the United States system'of jurisprudence a man is innocent until proven guilty . We 'll have to determine that ? and we are a long way from knowing all the facts at this time , " Excerpts from the interview : Do you think that Watergate has seriously cut into leadership on the President 's part ? Yes , I think it has . But by the same token , it has- brought about a better understanding between the Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years remaining could make a comeback from Watergate ? if he is not personally involved ? // // Yes , I think so . Because , after all , the President , as such , is n't nearly as important as ? the institution of , the , presidency . And the government must be run as responsibily as pos , sible . We are prepared to donur share ' ? meet him at least half way . And I think that we will be able to function on a more equitable basis . . What about the post-Watergate period ? WM Watergate usher in a better day in politics and government ? Yes , I think there has been hope in this . Because many people have been shocked at this ? that individuals would place their loyalty to the President above their loyalty to the country and to the Constitution , and in so doing endanger the office of the presidency , and in so doing endanger the constitutional democracy . But it is a situation which will help to strengthen the bedrock of our system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to purge ourselves . ? ? Frankly , I feel sorry for everyone concerned . The committee members have a difficult job . I feel sorry for the witnesses , their wives , their families . But I feel sorriest of all for the people , as a whole . . . . Do you think that more legislation is needed ? We need more legislation ? and legislation that will be enforceable ; which will cut down on the amount of contributions an individual ' can make for a presidential or senatorial candidate ; which will shorten the length.of campaigns which have ? become unbearable and repetitious ; which will bring about something of the order of a national priniary on the same day so that ? all this showmanship , expense , and whatnot , will be done away with . And rigid laws must be in effect so that phony letters like those used against ( Senators ) Muskie , ; Humphrey , and Jackson will be punishable ? far more punishable than they are at the present time . Do you think the shock , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very soon ? I think so " ? yes . - Wholly . apart from whether the President was personally involved in Watergate , was there an administrative responsibility on the part of the President for what has gone on ? Yes , that is a valid point . I think that Mr. Nixon delegated so much responsibility and put so . much confidence in his subordinates that they took advantage of the confidence whiCh was placed in them and they did the President and the nation a disservice in ways- that are becoming apparent to all . ? You have known the President a long time and seen a good deal of him these days . Is there anything in him ? any personal characteristic ? which you feel may have had a bearing on the Watergate incident ? ? Well , the President , fundamen. tally , is a loner . . . . But unfortunately when you get away from Washington , if you do it too much , you lose ' touch with events as they are really happening and you do n't , have the contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- government suffers to a degree because of the lack of , this cooperation , this accommodation this partnership , which is so vital to the functioning of this republic . If you do n't have this relationship ' of - President and Congress , ' It throws the whole ship ? of state out of kilter and the end result is what we are facing at the present time . Our government operates on a very delicate balance and when that balance is disturbed , we get into serious diffciulties . Because of Watergate , the President 's effort to achieve better relations with Congress , are you saying that he could well imprOve his performance over the next three years ? Oh , yes . . .. You recall his Pekin ( illinois ) speech the other day he said he wanted to work more closely with Congress in a spirit of understanding and partnership . We will meet him at least half way because we think it is n't the individual ? fortunes of each of us that ' counts so much as the strengthening of the institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the weeks and months approach there will be increasing understanding and cooperation between the two branches .
