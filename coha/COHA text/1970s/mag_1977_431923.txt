 | Dirty Movies ! Dirty Books ! Explicit ads for X-rated movies take over newspaper entertainment pages . Porno theaters and " adult " bookstores invade residential neighborhoods . Graphically illustrated brochures pushing hard-core publications arrive unwanted in the mail . Even children 's stories , such favorites as Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio , are brought to the screen as " sexploitation " films . Public pornography seems inescapable these days and people who are offended or wearied by it ? or who are worried about the effects it will have on their children ? feel helpless to do something to stop the trend . That , says an aggressive young Federal prosecutor from Tennessee , is a mistake . He believes that the multimillion-dollar porno industry wants us to think that nothing can be done to solve this growing problem , but the truth of the matter is far different . " Flagrant pornography could be eradicated in just two years , " declares Larry Parrish , Assistant U.S. Attorney in Memphis . " And it can be done entirely within the law , with perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , he explains , is that obscenity is no longer hard to define . " Many people still are not aware of it , but after years of vacillation and confusion the Supreme Court has finally given us specific ' guidelines for determining what is obscene . And once it is identified , its purveyors can be put out of business . " Parrish , 33 , a tall , intense Southerner whose slow drawl seems only to underscore his confidence , is fast becoming the country 's leading expert on blockading the smut traffic . While many prosecutors in recent years have failed or have neglected even to try , Parrish has managed lately to obtain convictions against 30 obscenity defendants , some of whom have been sentenced to prison , a punishment almost unheard of in such cases . Nearly 20 others have been tried and are awaiting the judges ' verdicts ; still others have fled the country . In his most famous case , involving the well-publicized film Deep Throat , his arguments before a Federal jury last April brought convictions to a long string continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the star . At this writing , while those defend are awaiting sentencing , Parrish is r ing ahead with other prosecutions , u , a courtroom strategy he says can readily and successfully be adopted in s. munities throughout the United Su , ? and one that ordinary , concerned zens can help bring , about . Parrish , who has been officially mended by the Justice Department for his legal skills , has been a prose tor for seven years , his abiding intoin government service having first ignited at age nine , when he water the 1952 political conventions on IN The yearbook from his Nashville tschool characterized him as the " frier liest " member of his class , but fel : . students recall that he also was among the most zealous . Not because he 's ? , sort of crusader , " the amiable , per , sive Parrish maintains , but beca. " whatever I happen to be involved at any given moment is the most portant thing in the world to me .

" the Parrishes ' surprise , the previews coming attractions highlighted an ero : scene in which a nude man slim atop a nude woman and proceeded gray ically to simulate sexual intercourse. sat there with this bunch of kids watching and asked myself : What in the wor has happened that anyone could care so , little for young , undeveloped minds that he would expose them to this ? " A few days later he noticed a sign in the window of an adult booksto-e in downtown Washington : " Everythi : -c in this store approved by the Supreme Court . " Inside he found thousands books and magazines with full-col , photographs of men and women involve ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was aghast , " he recalls . " I decides there either is no law against obscenirr or this stuff is in violation of it . " It was not until several years lateafter he joined the U.S. Attorney ' , staff in Memphis , that Parrish got - . chance to test the law . In 1972 , the FBI : seized a number of 16-mm stag films in Memphis and charged distributors an . exhibitors with transporting obscene material across the state lines , whist was a violation of Federal felony statutes . In the fall of 1975 , after innumerable delays by defense attorneys , Parrish - finally won the case . Since then he haprobably become the government 's mos : . @#  | successful pornography prosecutor , doggedly purse g ducers , distributors , financial backers , theater owners are others in the high echelons of the smut trade . Of the defendants he has moved against , only one has acquitted so far . Critics contend he is driven by a personal pr against sexually explicit material . While he admits pornography repulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that laws on the books be aggressively enforced . " Otherwise , " he says . ' - lose faith in government . When flagrant violations allowed to go unpunished , it has an undermining effect threatens our whole legal system . " Crucial to his winning cases has been his ability to obscenity for a jury . " Attorneys defending pornography want everyone to believe that obscenity is simply a s tive thing , " Parrish says . But unbeknownst to many the U. S. Supreme Court in 1973 , in reviewing a gr cases lumped under the title Miller vs . California , estate a three-point test for obscenity that for the first ti eluded objective elements . " If printed or photographic material fits this test , " Parrish explains , " it is obscene the law of the land ? and open to prosecution . " ? First , the material in question must depict " pat offensive , hard-core sexual conduct " which , the Court means " ultimate sex acts , masturbation , excretion and lewd exhibition of the genitals . " " This part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Either a book or a does depict these acts or it does n't . " ? Second , applying contemporary standards , the rt rial taken as a whole must " appeal to the prurient inter of the average person . " " That does n't mean the ave . adult , the average moviegoer , or the average Quaker 65 . It means the average human being in our populations Parrish says . To put some " meat and bones on that perm he has called demographers as witnesses . " They cone with a person 29 ? years old , two kids with a third o way , married once , employed ? a very stable , traditi a person who observers some sort of religious activity in home and who has never seen a hard-core movie . Y paint a picture of the average person and you see it just not a porno freak ! " Parrish has also called psychologists and psychiatrists testify that " prurient interests " refer to such a person innate ( and possibly suppressed ) curiosity about sex . " Co trary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material in question does not have to actually arm , the average person 's prurient interest , " Parrish says , ' only to appeal to it , to speak to it . " ? Finally , the material as a whole " must lack serio artistic , scientific , literary or political value . " Parrish co cedes that this point is open to subjective judgment . " B points of law often involve subjective decisions , such as whether a man is guilty of first-degree murder or only of negligent manslaughter . Every day in this country , a thousand juries make subjective decisions interpreting the law. - In court , Parrish puts philosophers , anthropologists , political scientists , literary and artistic authorities on the stand to offer their expert opinions as to a work 's value . Then @#  | he lets the jury " weigh the evidence and decide , which is the jury 's proper function . " Only if a film , book or magazine fits all three points of the Supreme Court 's test , Parrish stresses , can it be considered obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-core material ? not movies or literature of any merit , regardless of how erotic or explicit ? can properly be subject to prosecution . " Ideas and the advocacy of ideas are absolutely protected , " he says . Many people just do n't understand what hard core ' means , " Parrish says . " The ordinary citizen thinks we 're talking about cutie-nudie movies and books with flirty , sexual overtones . But hard-core is really something else entirely . We 're talking about movies and magazines , for instance , that show adult men having sex with little girls , boys having homosexual intercourse , group sex orgies , people urinating on each other , men and women using whips and chains to beat each other . Once they understand what obscene ' really is , most people do n't want it around . " The only effective weapon for getting rid of it , Parrish believes , is vigorous prosecution . He says that too many prosecutors at both the Federal and local levels are now avoiding the pornography issue and the laws against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornography , arbitrarily refuse to present obscenity cases to grand juries , denying the legal process an opportunity to determine if laws are being violated . Others have not fully grasped the significance of the Miller decision and erroneously believe the Supreme Court 's view of what constitutes obscenity is still so fuzzy as to make lasting conviction impossible . Still others would like to bring pornographers to justice but are hamstrung by local laws . Parrish cites , as an example , one community where an ordinance requires two days ' notice to a theater operator before supposedly obscene films can be seized . " Naturally , once he gets the notice , he does n't keep the movies around . " Obscenity laws in many states and cities are poorly written and need drastic revision and updating , Parrish says , to reflect the guidelines of the Miller decision . " The laws should uniformly make obscenity violation a felony , punishable by prison sentence , " he says . " Fines just do n't have an impact . They are built into the ticket prices . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations and prosecutions could be carried out against obscenity peddlers at all levels of government , not just in Federal courts . According to Parrish , concerned citizens can play a vital role in bringing about these changes . He advises people to visit state legislators with evidence of sup-198 @# @#  | such as massive petitions , and dethat obscenity laws be modernized. ' t shout , do n't take the press with Just very quietly back the legislator a corner . Tell him , You be the : or of this and you take the credit . are the petitions of people who will rt you and your effort ? and vote -t you if something is not done . ' " on his courtroom experiences and live research , Parrish has drafted a I law which he says can be effective anti-obscenity statute in any state . ill supply copies free to any legislator - who requests them . Similarly , citizens can call on local tutors , since they are elected officials therefore also sensitive to public on . Prosecutors , Parrish says , should urged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue . On a number of , ions he has offered free advice on five courtroom tactics . " I do n't mend that citizens picket or resort extralegal measures , " he says , " bein the long run such methods ' t effective . They reduce the issue a shouting match , and prosecuting enity is something that needs rality . In many areas , however , prosecutors do need to know that the public is action before they themselves will effective measures were begun toParrish predicts , solid laws could on the books in most jurisdictions in a year . " You would see an instanus drop of the pornography trade 50 to 60 percent , " he says . " Then n perhaps five or six major court have resulted in convictions and n sentences , you would see pornography shrink within another year to a R : : 1 . underground business , comparable hat it was 20 years ago . As such , it would be no more than a limited , hidden . ciminal activity , which law enforcement control as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ssue . " Before Deep Throat , porno s were crude pictures , made hastily motel rooms with nonentities as . formers . But Deep Throat had stars , had a budget . it had tremendous motion ? and it opened a door , itimizing obscenity as just another acceptable art form . ' Pornography glamorizes a hedonistic e-style . It puts forth the view that kinds of sex it depicts are normal , en healthy . Pornographers are very filled marketeers , and more and more they are aiming their products at young ople . One of my expert witnesses , a political scientist , says that he believes obscenity one of the six most important social problems facing the United States toIt is so serious because of its subtlety . We become anesthetized to its image . We become convinced it is harmless . " Once , we felt the same way about defence in the media . Now we are coming to recognize we were wrong . Someday -- hopefully not after it is too L.te ? we will reach the same conclusion . c'out the impact of obscenity  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
