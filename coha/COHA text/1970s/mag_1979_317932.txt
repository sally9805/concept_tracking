" We Love You " <P> New view of the Viet Nam vet <P> The young man in the wheelchair began speaking softly , but then his voice turned bitter . His tone and words hushed the crowd at the city hall ceremony in Manhattan marking the beginning of Viet Nam Veterans Week . " You people ran a number on us , " declared Robert Muller , 33 , a former Marine lieutenant who lost the use of his legs in Viet Nam combat when a bullet shattered his spine . " Your guilt , your hang-ups. , your uneasiness made it socially unacceptable to mention the fact that we were Viet Nam veterans . " Pounding his knee with a clenched fist , he accused most Americans of regarding G.I.s who fought in Indochina as " Lieut . Calley types , crazed psychos or dummies that could n't find their way to Canada . That really hurts when you remember the pride we had . We fought hard and we fought well . " <P> Muller 's bitterness reflected the widespread and justified feeling among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.8 million who served in Southeast Asia , that they have been treated much less sympathetically and generously than servicemen from previous wars . There are growing signs , however , that the national mood is changing . The standing ovation that Muller 's tough talk received in Manhattan was one indication of that . <P> So was Jimmy Carter 's moving speech at last week 's White House ceremony observing Veterans Week . To an East Room audience composed mostly of Vieit Nam vets , including Muller , Carter said that " the nation is ready to change its heart , its mind and its attitude about the men who had fought in the war . ' ' After admitting that not enough has been done " to respect , honor , recognize and reward your special heroism , " the President said : " We love you for what you were and what you stood for-and we love you for what you are and what you stand for . " <P> Welcome as they are , warm words alone will not satisfy the vets . Various groups , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are organizing to fight harder for better education benefits , job training , health and readjustment programs . Muller , who is executive director of the Council of Viet Nam Veterans and the emerging spokesman for the movement , wants vets in more key Government positions . He notes that " only five of the 700 ' policy ' posts filled by Carter have gone to Vietvets . " There is also growing concern in the Government about veterans ' allegations that Agent Orange , a defoliant used during the war , might have inflicted serious injuries on servicemen exposed to it . <P> Agreeing that more must be done to aid the veterans of Viet Nam , Carter has pledged to support extending the G.I. Bill of Rights and promised to push for special vocational rehabilitation programs for the disabled . Capitol Hill too has been demonstrating a new attitude toward the vets . One reason may be that the number of Viet Nam veterans in Congress now totals 19 .
