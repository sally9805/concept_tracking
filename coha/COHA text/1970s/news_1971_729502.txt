txt The Government submitted to Parliament today sweeping tax reform legislation that would remove one million persons from the tax rolls , cut taxes for 4.7 million and impose cap ? ital gains taxes in Canada for the first time . In a long budget statement to the House of Commons , Edgar J. Benson , the Finance Minister , promised " progres-1 sive reductions " in individual income tax rates during the next four years . He said the Federal corpo. ' rate tax rate would be cut over four years , from 50 per cent to 46 per cent . The American rate is 48 per cent . Federal inheritance taxes would be ended . Mr. Benson said that to encourage the use of antipollution equipment he was excluding it from Canada 's general 12 per cent manufacturers ' sales tax . Reductions in excises and tariffs were designed to benefit the following industries : consumer electronics , margarine , petrochemicals , logging , pulp and paper and electric utilities , The budget contained several measures to encourage Canadians to invest at home rather than abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a controversial . topic these days . However , one item would tend to discourage the sale of small companies to foreigners . Nor did Mr. Benson announce a new fixed parity for the Canadian dollar , which has been floating freely in the foreign exchange market since June 1 , 1970 . Despite widespread concern about high unemployment , Mr. Benson offered only one mild . general stimulant to the economy  --  repeal from July 1 of the 3 per cent income surtax . The Minister forecast stronger economic growth in the second half of 1971 and declining ' unemployment . Mr. Benson 's advisers have told him that the unemployment rate-6.3 per // cent in May  --  may drop to 5 per cent , a so-called " full employment " level , by the end of 1972 . Mr. Benson 's reluctance to stimulate the economy more forcefully was evidently linked to a fear or inflation . " There is still too much slack in the economy , " he told the House of Commons . " At the same time , costs are still rising at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 597 pages of proposed tax reform legislation Mr. Benson sent to the Speaker 's table represented the result of nine years of study and debate . In 1962 , the Progressive Conservative party Government of former Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker appointed a Royal Commission , headed by the late Kenneth Carter , to make a comprehensive examination of Canada 's income tax . Stress on Tax Relief The Carter commission reported to the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson early in 1967 . It recommended radical changes , based on the proposition that equity required that all forms of income ? . salaries , dividends , stock profits and so on  --  be taxed equally . " A buck is a buck is a buck , " Mr. Carter said . In outlining a proposed tax program in November , 1969 , the present Liberal Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott ' Trudeau moved toward , but did not fully embrace , the Carter philosophy , In the revisions published today , there was more emphasis on tax relief , and perhaps a litle less on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has retreated on several points , among them its earlier intention to prohibit deductions for all business entertainment . The business lunch or evening at a hockey game are evidently safe , although the Government said it still intended to eliminate deductions for lodges , yachts and memberships in golf or country clubs . For conventions to be deductible they will have to be held within the territory of the group that is meeting . Whereas the Government insisted it was open-minded about its 1969 program , it is substantially committed to today 's proposed legislation . Mr. Benson said debate would start in the Commons in September and that the bill would take effect from Jan. 1 , 1972 , Heavier Than in U. S. The new scale of individual tax rates includes reductions from top to bottom , but the largest proportionate savings will be realized by taxpayers with low incomes . Married persons with incomes of $15,000 or more will incur smaller tax liabilities on their salaries but will probably pay more taxes over-all because of the introduction of capital gains taxes and other changes . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax ; 1 4.7 million would pay less ; 2 million would pay about the same , and 1.3 million , largely in the upper brackets , would pay more . Taxes have been higher in Canada than in the United States for years . No new comparison was published today , but officials acknowledged that the Canadian tax burden would continue to be heavier . All taxpayers would benefit from increased exemptions , to $1,500 from $1,000 for unmarried persons and to $2,850 from $2,000 for married couples . The exemption for each dependent child remains $300 . Other forms of tax relief included special treatment for the elderly , blind and bedridden , and deductions for child-care and the cost of moving to a new job . As an incentive to the expansion of Canadian-controlled small businesses in which the public does not ' have stock , the Government proposed to tax the first $50,000 of income at 25 per cent instead of 46 per cent .
