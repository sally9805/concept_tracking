It was one of those sticky summer afternoons in the Catskills , when everything seems to slow down . Even the flies seemed intimidated , slowed by the heaviness of the air . The sun radiated in a cloudless sky , over the heads of dozens of children awaiting the arrival of The Doctor . He arrived on time , stepping gracefully out of his station wagon and into the heat . His size  --  six feet , seven inches , 200 pounds  --  commanded immediate respect . He was surrounded . He waved his extraordinarily long arms , wiggled the fingers on his enormous hands , bounded up and down lightly on his size 151/2 shoes . The teenagers clustered around him as he moved , asking questions , reverentially calling him " Doc . " Whether he is summoned as " Doctor , " " Doc , " " Dr. J , " Julius , Julie , or Jewel , Julius Erving merits attention whenever he appears in public . On that hot day , the twenty-five-year-old pro basketball wizard , the most valuable aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kutsher 's Sports Academy in Monticello , New York to mingle with aspiring young basketball players . When he walked into the fieldhouse , wearing a blue T-shirt and red shorts , all play stopped . He walked over to the free throw line on one of the courts , caught a ball thrown by a small boy eager to serve him and casually shot some free throws . A confident teenager plunged through the crowd and challenged him . Erving smiled and accepted . The boy , husky and tall at fifteen , dribbled beyond the free throw line and took a jump shot . It went in . He grinned . He dribbled again , took another shot . It glanced off the rim . Erving strolled more than twenty feet from the basket , glanced thoughtfully at it . He made ten in a row , rapidly . The game was over . " You were using my ball , " the boy snarled . " I had to use another one . " Erving suppressed a laugh . " Lose , " he said , drawing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the camp coaches volunteered next . Erving wiped him out , ten baskets to four . A six-foot , eight-inch sixteen-year-old high school center from Manhattan stepped forward . Alert , eager , agile , but not yet initiated , he went one-on-one against Erving in a playground battle out of Erving 's own childhood . The Doctor won , but not easily ; he simply wore out the boy . " You 've got to have it at the end of the game , " Erving told him , patting him gently on the back . On the sidelines , a black teenager , at the camp on a scholarship , turned to a friend and said , " The Doctor , he 's a good guy . Friendly . A gentleman . Some of them wo n't even talk to you . " Erving lingered to talk to the kids , then went off to play tennis with friends . He had done his job for the day . Now it was time to relax . He does not relax often . Erving is a serious man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is foreign . A dignified man with a well-defined sense of purpose , Erving is thoughtful , careful , intense about his work and his play . Whatever he is doing , his face remains tranquil , the regal countenance of an ancient Egyptian ruler . He is a quiet , strong , American hero . In America , perhaps more than in any other country , we expect our athletic heroes to achieve for us , to give us a participatory feeling in the race toward excellence . We want our heroes to he young and strong and peerless . Erving qualifies . Millions of basketball fans watch the game , in person and on television , and most of those who do acquire a special respect for Erving . They respect him for his sense of calm ; Erving does not rage . They respect him for having emerged from a confining black childhood to become an expert at his trade . They respect him for his efficiency , and the dazzling way he shows it , on the basketball court . When Erving plays , he can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and to do it memorably . At age twenty-five , he has become known wherever the game is discussed . The idolatry that surrounds him is not limited to the New York area , where he has spent most of his life . In years to come , he is likely to sustain the extraordinarily high level of grace and skill for which he has become famous . He is a unique competitor in a game known for the fierceness of its competition . It is not easy to excel as he does , to be thought of as one of the greatest players who ever played basketball ; it is a game played by many men who know their craft . Erving in action is memorable , even when there are other gifted players around . His repertoire of shots , from dunks to jump shots , and his offensive versatility have made him unique . In his book , The Legend of Dr. J ( copyright ? 1975 by Marty Bell published by Coward , McCann &; Geoghegan , Inc. , 200 Madison Ave. , New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is quiet and unemotional . But he has tremendous inner confidence . Beat him to the hoop or push him or hold him . He will never shout you down . He will just quietly go about his business in a very orderly manner . Eventually he will make a move that lets you know what is on his mind . Do n't tell them . Show them . " He handles the basketball the way the average person handles a tennis ball . He can call for a pass from a teammate , reach out one hand and catch the pass like a first baseman catching a throw from third . . . . He can jump higher than anyone in the game . He can hang in the air while others have already returned to the ground . . . He leaves the floor farther from the basket than seems humanly possible . It is as if he is flying to the basket . " Whatever he does on the court , Erving does with confidence . " I 've got enough confidence in myself to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can beat me , " he has said . " Athletes have to think like that . But that does n't make me better than someone else as a person . " He is not an arrogant man . He has spent much of his life improving . Nothing has distracted him from it . His junior high school coach , Earl Mosley , has remembered that " Julius was never a street hanger . He would never hang out drinking wine as so many of the other kids did . If you wanted Julius , you always knew where to find him  --  in the park or at the school . He never asserted himself by being brash or loud or lewd . And I never remember seeing him in a fight or an argument . And you got ta know that many of the games in the park ended in fights and arguments . Most of the kids wanted to show they were the best with their fists . But Jewel always asserted himself by creating a move . " His moves , a catalogue of leaps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive . " I can do things I do because I put in the time experimenting with them , developing them and polishing them , " he has said . " I know what I should do in certain situations , and that 's what I do .... I know players who can do fantastic things with the ball but they never do them . They fear that if they do n't play a mechanical game and stick to the pattern , they 're going to be taken out . I 'd hate to be in a position where I had to play like that . " For Erving , consistency is more than a goal ; it is almost an obsession . To achieve it , he has developed a sense of concentration that is envied even by those players who have found it through forms of meditation . When he is playing , he is not distracted . If what he does generates excitement , that is an innocent by-product of his attitude , his determination . He does not set out to impress , in any crowd-pleasing conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best as well as he can do it . Off the court , he looks for answers . " A lot of people who watch me play come away with the impression that I 'm the type of person who might generate excitement , make things happen and be an extrovert in every sense of the word , just by how I play . But that 's not me . . That 's not Julius Erving , the poor black kid from Roosevelt and Hempstead , New York , one who has gone out and tried to gain a better understanding of what makes people do the things they do , and why this is as it is and why that is as it is . " Erving expressed one side of his personality as an athlete . There is more to him than that . " I know there are more important things in life than basketball , " he told one reporter . " Right now , it 's my life , but it 's really something for escape and enjoyment . I know I 'll have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to learn to live to my full capabilities and be able to help others benefit from my experience . I think I 'm a good person , but I want to be even better , as a human being and an athlete . " In a game played by many narcissists and egomaniacs , Erving 's realistic view of himself is rare . It is not false humility . Erving is , at heart , a conservative , a millionaire who spends money cautiously , a successful man who plans his future meticulously , a pensive man in a flamboyant sport . The story of his life provides some clues to his growth as a player and as a man . Erving was born on February 22 , 1950 in Hempstead , Long Island , New York . His mother cleaned other people 's houses and supported Julius , his brother Mar- When he was ten years old , Erving decided to join a Salvation Army basketball team . This was to prove to be a pivotal decision in his life . " I started playing basketball in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a coach named Don Ryan who took an interest in us and who really opened up my eyes . A lot of the guys came from broken homes and Don taught us things that we ordinarily would have learned from our fathers , like how to conduct ourselves in a strange environment .... " I traveled with the Salvation Army team ... and I came to see that basketball represented an avenue of getting out and seeing things . The more I saw , the more I wanted to see . " In retrospect , Erving concluded that his " family survived because we had determination and a positive outlook . A lot of people that I grew up with had the same opportunities that I had , but they didn'thave the same attitude . They just thought they 'd do nothing , like everybody else  --  they would hang around and that would be it . They did n't realize that your goals will determine what you 're going to be . I saw that basketball could be my way out and I worked hard to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was thirteen , his mother remarried and the family moved to nearby Roosevelt . Erving found a neighborhood playground , a field of green cement , and began to practice regularly ( today there is a sign at that playground : This Is Where Julius Erving Learned the Game of Basketball ) . His skills were apparent to those who played with him . One friend , Leon Saunders , began calling him " The Doctor , " in tribute to the curative power of the moves he made ; later a pro teammate , Willie Sojourner , shortened it to " Dr. J. " After high school , he decided to attend the University of Massachusetts on coach Wilson 's recommendation . He had not yet reached his full height and the pro vin and sister Alexis . They lived in a low-income housing project . When Erving was three , his father moved out . He has spent the years since guided by his mother and a series of coaches who provided the inspiration his father did not . " He was never a snappy child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to listen and he did n't give anyone cause to dislike him . He is smart and deep-thinking . " She added , " He always liked to make money . And he always loved to save money . " For Erving as a child , in his words , " Basketball was a type of escape for me . If I had a little argument at home , rather than staying to fight it out , I 'd go out to the park . I never dreamt of having grand things . " He did depend upon his mother . " My mother taught me to love and respect and to use common sense in judging right from wrong . I think that understanding has helped me retain a proper perspective . " James A. Michener It was thirty years ago that the Post introduced James A. Michener to its readers . When the manuscript of Tales of the South Pacific crossed editor Ben Hibbs ' desk in 1946 , he knew Michener 's was a very special talent . " When we read the book manuscript , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought home more of the whatit-was-really-like flavor of the war ... than anything we had ever read . " Hibbs excerpted one of the tales ? " Remittance Man " ? and gave it prominent display in the magazine , three months prior to publication of the book . Tales of the South Pacific won the Pulitzer Prize for Michener and was later the basis for Rodgers and Hammerstein 's classic musical , South Pacific . In 1976 , Michener is once again in the Post , the author of " A Pilgrimage for Peace " ( page 67 ) . His credits . since his debut are a compilation of two decades of best-sellers : Bridges at Toho-Ri ( 1953 ) , Sayonara ( 1954 ) , Hawaii ( 1959 ) , The Source ( 1965 ) , The Drifters ( 1971 ) and Centennial ( 1974 ) . After writing about the Pacific for most of his career , Michener turned to America when he wrote Centennial , designed to be a personal Bicentennial gift to his country . In a 1962 Post offering entitled " Why I Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , I would seem to be the least likely candidate for public office that a major party could find . But three factors do not appear on the surface . ( 1 ) I used to teach American history and took the subject very seriously .

I owe a debt to America which is constantly in my mind and which I have always been willing to repay , either by volunteering for military service or helping out in government . " Michener 's bid for office  --  he ran as a Democrat from Bucks County , Pennsylvania  --  was unsuccessful .

After covering World War II , he began an association with The Saturday Evening Post that continues to this day . From 1945 to 1969 , he was the Post 's photographer in the nation 's capital . With Post editor Stewart Alsop , he was a pioneer in the field of investigative reporting . When Richard Nixon became President , he asked 011ie to become the official White House Photographer , and thus began five years of world traveling . He went everywhere the President went  --  to Russia and China and the Grand Ole Opry . He is now the Washington editor of the Saturday Evening Post and lives with his wife Marjorie on a farm near McLean , Virginia . scouts had not discovered him . It was during that period that Erving faced his first serious emotional crisis . His brother died at age sixteen , of lupus The two brothers had been close , loving . Erving has rarely spoken about it . " That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julius Erving admitted several years later . " When he died , I stopped fearing ? and I stopped crying . Right now , I do n't think there is anything that can make me cry . " The loss of his brother made him even more single-minded about basketball . So did his blackness . After his sophomore year , he toured Europe and Russia with an N.C.A.A. team ; he was named the Most Valuable Player . During the summer , he continued to work out at the local park playground . " I had the key then , " he recalled . " I turned off the lights when I left , sometimes around midnight . I worked on shooting and dribbling . If somebody else was around , I 'd play one-on-one , 100 points wins . We did n't play for money . We played for ego and pride . " There is a psychology to the playground game . It makes you want to beat a guy in a way that makes him pay twice . You want to outscore stood around on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another game with Kentucky , he went one-on-one with Gilmore . Julie was moving in and Artis was guarding the bucket . Julie palmed the ball and took off , like he was going to stuff it . Artis moved in on him and stuck his long arm at Julie . While he was still in the air , Julie changed hands , moved the ball from his right to his left hand and made the shot with his left hand in midair . I just stopped . I could n't believe it . " Cincy Powell , an able A.B.A. forward now retired , played against Erving that him and you want to freak him out with a big move or a big block . That way , even if the score is tied , you and he both know you 're really ahead . " Gradually , he came to see " how people lived on the other side of the fence . Big houses , two cars , color TV . I wondered what you had to do to get them . " What you had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could . In his junior year at the University of Massachusetts , he averaged twenty-seven points and nineteen rebounds . Few pro teams noticed . For them , Massachusetts was an obscure school . One team owner , Earl Foreman of the Virginia Squires , did hear about Erving and while the other teams hesitated , Foreman moved in . He signed Erving to a four-year , $500,000 contract in 1971 ; Erving left college for the pro game . Jim " Jumbo " Eakins , a six-foot , eleven-inch center , was on the Squires at the time . " I was a veteran center when they brought him in and I wondered how he 'd make it , " Eakins said . " You ca n't really tell in practice . Julius stood out , certainly , and he had the tools , but you never know . " Then we played Kentucky . Artis Gilmore was the name in that game . The first time Julie took off , Artis was waiting for him . The ball was up and through before Artis could move . Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen in practice . The other four guys on our team just year . He has n't forgotten the experience . " Sure , I had heard things about him , " Powell said . " The word came down that he was doing things Connie Hawkins was n't doing . I had my reservations . You know . You hear things . But the first time we played him , when I was at Kentucky , man there were all those moves . " This guy was going higher than Elgin Baylor and Baylor was my idol . I had to guard him , which means that I 'd try to force him one way and get some help . Fast . He was going to go by you and how he could stretch and lean . The only way you could guard him was to put your hands on him . You 'd rather have him shoot from outside , not come driving at you . But one-on-one , you were going to foul him or lose him . I 'd never seen anybody play that position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got forty points . Doc would n't let me off the court without telling me , see you when you come back . ' He has that winner 's attitude . He does n't like to lose . " That first year in the A.B.A. , Erving maintained his consistency , just as he had in college . He averaged twenty-seven points and sixteen rebounds . His spectacular moves astonished opponents , encouraged teammates and won the allegiance of fans . In the A.B.A. playoffs at the end of that season , the Squires faced the Floridians in Miami . Erving did it all , as they say in basketball : fifty-threepoints , making twenty-one of twenty-eight shots from the field ; fourteen rebounds , and six assists . The entire Squires team scored 118 points in the win . Teammate Adrian Smith , after that game , was wide-eyed . " When they come to write about the greatest basketball games ever played , Julius Erving 's performance tonight will rank up there with the very best . I have seen Jerry West , Oscar Robertson and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Erving did for us tonight , " Smith said . The Floridians ' coach , Bob Bass , lamented , " Some of his shots were unbelievable . I do n't know how they went in . We tried three different guys against him and we just could n't stop him . " Erving commented after the game : " This is no pleasure trip , you know . We came here on business . " The following summer , Atlanta of the N.B.A. , the tried-and-true league , tried to steal Erving . The word had got around both leagues . Erving did play a few exhibition games with Atlanta , but relented and returned for another fine year with Virginia . It was to be transitional . During that time , Erving met another man who was to join his list of father figures , an athletes ' manager named Irwin Weiner . Weiner , putting his negotiating skills to work , moved Erving to the New York Nets . The contract called for a payment of $2.8 million over an eight-yearperiod , plus compensation to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained , happily , in the A.B.A. " I 'm not losing any sleep over the fact that I 'm not in the N.B.A. 1 think I 've proved everything I have to prove , " he said . He knew what coming to the Nets would mean . It would mean , first of all , that he was coming home , back to Long Island , where the Nets played their games . It meant more than that . " They were losers , " Erving said . " From the minute I knew I was coming . . . I was preparing myself to stop that . " He did his job . In the 1973-74 season , number 32 led the Nets to the A.B.A. championship and was named the league 's Most Valuable Player . Although the Nets lost out in the playoffs last season , Erving shared the MVP award with George McGinnis . Again he averaged almost twenty-eight points ( as he has throughout his pro career ) ; he was in the league 's top ten in rebounding , assists , steals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both knees . Whatever the A.B.A. 's growing pains compared to the N.B.A. 's solidity ( bolstered by a lucrative TV contract ) , Erving 's reputation became irrefutably national . Along the way , he acquired a sleek Avanti II $12,000 automobile ( a gift from the Nets ) and gave his mother his slightly used Lincoln Continental Mark IV . He ac- a - // quired , as well , a Lido Beach condominium , property on the north shore of Long Island , an assortment of investments , a wife named Turquoise , her young son , and a son of his own , Julius Winfield Erving III . The wife and children were Erving 's achievements . The rest was the result of the influence of Irwin Weiner . Weiner is a short , compactly built , tough high school dropout from the Bronx . He is a man in his mid-forties , whose life  --  studded with failures  --  changed when he met Walt Frazier in 1968 . When Weiner negotiated Frazier 's contract with the New York Knicks to Frazier 's satisfaction , Frazier set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frazier is president , but Weiner manages the day-to-day financial affairs of athletes , including Erving , Frazier , McGinnis , Bob Love , Bob Lanier , Marvin Barnes , Ron Johnson , Jon Matlack and Ben Jipcho , among many . In his office lined with autographed photos of sports heroes , Weiner waved his hands  --  decorated with a gold watch , a gold bracelet and two gold rings  --  and he talked about Erving . " He 's my friend first and my client second , " Weiner said . " I 'm godfather to his son . He 's his own man , but he listens to me . He may not take my advice . He decides . But if he gives you his word , you could put the Empire State Building on it . " We hattle , sure . He does n't like to spend money , even when he has obligations to spend it . What do I mean ? His wife uses credit cards . Julius will complain when the bills arrive and he 'll take them away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about that , because our friendship will never end over dollars . " Weiner concluded , " I respect him as a person and as a player . " Others concur . Billy Paultz , a former Nets ' center , has said : " He 's not at all like the stereotype of the spoiled superstar . A lot of superstars think they can take off from practice and loaf now and then on the court . But not Doc . His attitude has a great influence on the team .. .. He has one weakness . He ca n't shoot with his feet . " His wife , known as Turk , recognizes Erving 's virtues : " I love him because he 's so reliable and calm . He never gets mad and when I get angry he settles me right down . He 'll say , real quietly , ' Do n't you get no attitude now . ' He 's the sweetest , most down-to-earth guy you 'd ever meet . " Former San Diego player George Adams has opposed Erving and known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , I mean really stop Julius . You just run him up and down the court ... and pray that he gets tired . " Al Bianchi , who played pro ball in the N.B.A. for ten years and who was Erving 's coach and friend at Virginia , was another convert . " He was an unknown quantity . I did n't know he 'd be great . In fact , I was a bit edgy about signing him . But then I saw those hands , " Bianchi remembered . " Once he did his thing everybody smiled and said , ' We got one here . ' When we were in the last seconds of a close game , he always got the ball . Or he 'd make an instrumental play , to demoralize the opposing team and act as a catalyst on ours , maybe in the third quarter , and we 'd go on to win . " He has surpassed everyone who ever played the game . " I remember that first summer , one of the Kentucky players came back from playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen the best basketball player he 'd ever seen , a kid named Erving . Nobody believed him . Then he played for us . You just do n't forget him . He has a very special chemistry . " Kevin Loughery , Erving 's coach with the Nets , supports Bianchi 's view . " Erving is the best and most exciting forward in pro basketball . He 's a leader . I mean a real leader . ... He just does more and more . It is n't just the points and the rebounds and the passes ; it 's the way he does it . I see something different every night . And off the court , he 's one of the nicest guys you 'd ever want to meet , " Loughery said . It is true . Erving violates Leo Durocher 's most cherished maxim and evidence Continued on page 94 Dr. J continued from page 13 to the contrary can not be unearthed . The diligent investigator in search of someone who hates Erving comes up empty-handed . A face-to-face meeting with the Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Catskills last summer , Erving , freshly showered and at ease , watched the sun go down from a luxurious lakeside home owned by Weiner and Frazier and mused about his life . He thought about players he admired for their skills . He listed familiar names : McGinnis , Gilmore , Barry , Jabbar , Frazier and others . One man , however , meant more to him than the others . " Bill Russell . He impressed me the most as a man . I was a junior in college when I first met him . He lectured at my school and afterward we talked over coffee . I remember that he volunteered information as if he cared about my future . He did care . He fed me bundles . And I could relate what he said then to what happened to me later . He talked about school and about having kids . You know , he wanted me to know that in life we have a lot of opportunities , but the ones who advance must recognize them quickly and take advantage of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appreciation of the positivism that Russell embodied is a sharp sense of the negative . Erving knows what upsets him . " In a game , when a guy plays dirty and tries to hurt another player . I do n't mean little tricks , like holding a guy 's shirt or shorts . I mean something that can harm your career . When I play I want 100 percent concentration . I want to do it all . So when a guy tries that on me , I pay him back by embarrassing him . Off the court , what bothers me most is when someone lies to me . I do n't like to be deceived , to be a party to any kind of game . I get very tired of that . " He is , as Cincy Powell pointed out , a winner . Yet he can deal with losing . In last year 's play-offs , the Nets lost , 4-1 , to a St. Louis team they had beaten eleven times without a defeat during the regular season . " I accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical thinker . I learn from experience . But then I do some research . I try not to repeat my errors . " In the play-offs , we had a mid-season slump at the end of the season . We lost our cohesiveness . We were strangers . We took too much for granted , too often . An example of not being aggressive as a unit . Like a cancer , too . We were dying as a team , in practice and in the games . We knew it was wrong , but we could n't adjust . Usually , at the end of the season you 're stronger physically and tired mentally . And they , St. Louis , played fantastic basketball . They were hungry and we were n't . " Winners make more money than losers and Erving is , as others have pointed out , a careful man with money . " I 'm a conservative spender , sure .

In fact , I give myself an allowance of $125 a week and many weeks I do n't spend that . " When you 're a child , your needs are greatest . As you grow older , your needs diminish . A little food , a little clothing , a little shelter and I 'll be all right . When I want something , I buy it . I do n't have to say I need it . I just do n't mistake a want for a need . I have thirty pairs of slacks and maybe ten or fifteen suits . Not too many . I want a lifestyle that I can maintain all my life . I ca n't do that if I spend it all now .

" I 've listened to all the campaigning , sure . But I never felt within me that there was any candidate I wanted to support . I was tricked once into endorsing a candidate I really did n't support . He did n't even thank me . That 's okay . For me , taking care of my professional life and my personal life is a full-time job . " Although he is not an activist , he contributes his time without charge to a select group of charities . Among them is the Salvation Army ; he is repaying a debt incurred when he was a child learning how to play basketball . He works for the National Lupus Erythematosus Foundation , an intense and haunting experience for him because of his brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Kennedy Foundation 's Special Olympics for retarded children . But , as Erving put it , " If I do n't care about the cause , I do it , if I do it at all , for a profit . " There are many such demands on his time now . He looks forward to the time when his career is over and he is free . " Yes , I do see a life of freedom . I do n't want anyone making demands on my time when I 'm done playing . I do n't want to commit my time then except in terms of what my inner feelings lead me to commit . I do n't want to work for anyone . I want to take a van , take the family and head Continued on page 113 that principle , it will truly be awful .

" Then Mr. Stephen Benton , chairman of the Committee on City Property and chairman in charge of the ceremonies , invited Mr. Lincoln to proceed to the " very agreeable duty assigned " to him . Lincoln hoisted a new thirty-four-star American flag to fly over the historic hall . The newspapers of the day showed line engravings of the event . Artist 's and engraver 's work could be reproduced in a line-cut print , but the modern style of half-tone engravings for reproducing photos in newspapers was not possible at that time .
