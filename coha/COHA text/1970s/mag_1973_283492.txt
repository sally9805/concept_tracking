Looming above the Watergate crisis is the possibility of President Nixon being summoned before some investigatory body to answer questions about his actions . No sooner was the matter broached late last month than a White House spokesman angrily declared that such summons would be rejected as " constitutionally inappropriate . " Perhaps , but Presidents Washington , Lincoln and Wilson all agreed to appear before Senate groups to answer questions , and Senator Sam Ervin has wondered why such answers could not be compelled-at least in the proper circumstances . " If we were engaged in a war , " he said , " and some judge in , say , Guam subpoenaed the President in a crap-shooting case or something , then I can see the high court overturning the subpoena . " But in the case of a Senate hearing , he added , " I ca n't see how the President would be inconvenienced . " <P> Ervin said he himself had no such present plans . But in a Supreme Court decision last June requiring reporters to testify before grand juries , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Were the Prince of Wales , the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord High Chancellor to be passing by in the same coach while a chimney sweeper and a barrow-woman were in dispute about a halfpennyworth of apples , and the chimney sweeper or the barrow-woman were to think proper to call upon them for their evidence , could they refuse it ? No , most certainly . " <P> White went on in his footnote to say that the great Chief Justice John Marshall had once ruled " that in proper circumstances a subpoena could be issued to the President . " Upon closer examination , Chief Justice Marshall 's opinion is not quite so clear . While he did subpoena President Thomas Jefferson to produce a letter he had received , for use by Aaron Burr in his treason trial , Marshall 's language was elaborately conciliatory and courteous . As for Jefferson , he asserted that the court had no right to compel information , but he did voluntarily supply an edited version of the letter . <P> Given that sort of precedent , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute form . <P> <P> Ervin 's committee was considering a subpoena of White House logs listing the disputed meetings between Nixon and Counsel John Dean . The White House first refused to turn over the logs -a move it once again called " constitutionally inappropriate " - then , after a change of heart , the Administration agreed to produce the documents . <P> Can the President , in fact , be forced to honor a subpoena ? Constitutionalists are to be found on all sides of the issue .
