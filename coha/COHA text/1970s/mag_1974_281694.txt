Jerry Ford moved in genial confusion through the Midwest last week wearing his WIN button and the same blue suit two days in a row . He stayed in Harry Truman 's old suite at the Muehlebach in Kansas City and was made a member of the Future Farmers of America . He did not dodge any protesters or reporters . In Sioux Falls the supporters of George McGovern were swept into his hammy grip just as readily as others . <P> The presidential barnstorming 's impact on the congressional elections next month may be entirely uncertain ; but Ford 's road show is more evidence that the new President is fighting a good campaign against self-isolation . No matter what they say now about the economy , oil and the Nixon pardon being Ford 's main problems , his biggest battle is with himself . The kind of frontal criticism Ford is getting usually encourages a President to seek protection . Behind him the Oval Office enlarges the impulse , offering opulent seclusion as the angry world goes by . <P> Shortly after Ford moved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up his shoe trees . A graduate of the Nixon School of Imperial Protocol was aghast because American Presidents are not supposed to indulge in such menial tasks . Fortunately Ford has not as yet found out that he is completely above the humdrum routines of daily existence . <P> The army of White House advance men hit Ohio State University like a flying wedge when Ford decided to speak there recently . An argument arose over whether to have a small table with a water pitcher beside the lectern . The university president wanted it , but the White House disagreed . Old-fashioned image . To the everlasting glory of the Buckeyes , they carried the field and there was a water pitcher on a table beside the lectern . <P> The monstrous machine that has grown up around the White House is frequently idiotic and it will cut a President off from the real world if he does not fight it tooth and claw . It is little things like shoe trees and water pitchers that keep a President anchored to the ground on which the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment . If enough of them are dulled from nonuse , a President can slip into narcosis . <P> <P> Ford seems to understand this and he is clinging to his old lifestyle . He uses Sir Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco , sometimes out of a can . After Daughter Susan and Photographer David Kennerly gave Ford his new pup , Liberty , the President stuffed some dog biscuits into his pockets . As plain folks know , the new master of a golden retriever should pass out the rewards and feed the dog for a few weeks . The President is going to have crummy pockets for a while , and when the White House cook gives Ford his English muffins in the morning , Ford is going to give Liberty his bowl of chow . <P> Ford 's suits have been comfortably baggy and wrinkled . The men 's clothiers are planning a massive counterattack to put him into some of those fastidious , elder-statesman outfits that Nixon and Johnson wore . No wrinkles , no bulges , no flaws . Nobody who really works can keep clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Ford has been seen with buckle shoes , no-cuff pants and colored shirts . The other day he had on a gray shirt . Not a dirty shirt . Just a gray-colored shirt , like one of those which children and wives get for fathers and husbands .
