If Gambia 's Prime Minister , Sir Dawda Jawara , K.B. , had peered out a window of his seaside residence a few days ago , he would have seen a fat , nude 75-year-old Swede standing on his head . Shocking ? Not a bit , for over the past four years the residents of this tiny West African nation have shrugged off the sight of Swedes-nude or clothed - who each winter desert their frosty homeland for a gambol on Gambia 's beautiful white sand beaches . As a travel brochure puts it : " If you like , you can swim nude alone-so huge are the beaches and so few are the tourists . " <P> To most Swedes , that sort of lure is irresistible-though it does present problems for the locals . The chamber of commerce plaintively requested Swedish tour directors to curb nudism on beaches near public thoroughfares : " It distracts drivers , cyclists and pedestrians . This is dangerous . " <P> Nudism may have its perils , but it has proved a gold mine for Swedish tour operators and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , a chartered 707 swoops into Yundum International Airport , disgorges 150 pink newcomers , and then hauls 150 bronzed Scandinavians back to icy Stockholm . At Yundum 's terminal , things get hectic , for the building is only 40 feet by 20 feet . Still , officials of Gambia Airways ( which has clerks and baggage handlers but flies no aircraft ) cope magnificently . Once tucked into one of Gambia 's three hotels , the tourists head for the beaches . The weather rarely presents a problem . If one millimeter of rain falls during the day , the tour operators will pay each tourist $200 , half the price of the packaged two-week stay . So far , they have n't had to pay off . <P> For Gambia-a minuscule former British colony with 316,022 people and 340,000 head of cattle-the tourist business represents what may be the country 's only chance to diversify its peanut-based , peanut-size economy . The locals catch on fast . As soon as the tourists arrive , bar , food and taxi prices zoom . The Atlantic Hotel charges an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air conditioner and 50 for a daily shot of mosquito spray . Toast for breakfast ? One must make a personal request to the manager . <P> Beyond the beaches and hotels , Gambia offers little in the way of action . Bathurst , the capital , has a scattering of rickety bars , and there is a discothque , located on a rusty hulk moored to Bathurst pier . The bars draw a splendid selection of the local layabouts , who cadge drinks off the Swedes , and there is hot competition these days for a waiter 's job at one of the hotels . Only last year , it seems , a strapping Swedish gym mistress selected one of the Atlantic 's diminutive waiters as a husband . <P> For the tourist who has had enough skinny-dipping , there is always the tour of the Pool of the Sacred White Crocodile at Bakau . On a recent Wednesday , one Swede reported the following dialogue : <P> Tourist : Where is the Sacred White Crocodile ? Little Boy : He come Friday 2 o'clock . Tourist : Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Master , that 's when the big tour ship come . Pause . But if you give me shilling , maybe crocodile he come now .
