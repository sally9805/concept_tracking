txt WASHINGTON , March ** " the boys , " as we call them , are . coming back from the war , but what are they coming back to ? And what are they bringing back with them  --  what thoughts , what dreams , what habits ? It is easier to answer the first question than the second . They are coming back to a divided country , which has five million unemployed and a dwindling market for unskilled labor ; a fabulously rich country with a shortage of houses as well as jobs and a surplus of inflation and social tension ? scarcely " a land fit for heroes . " We do not know what they are bringing back with them , but we know they are no longer " boys . " They are men trained in violence and guerrilla warfare , many of them no doubt resentful of their contemporaries who stayed at home , many more brutalized by battle or corrupted by cheap strong dope , all of them expecting , and rightfully too , useful work and a decent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past wars , will slip back under the orderly and civilizing routine of work and family . General Westmoreland , for example , is persuaded that the discipline of Army life will prove to be a stronger and more lasting force than the brutality or the corruption . Still , even if he is right , even if they are not a problem or a danger , they are surely a debt . At least on this we should be able to agree , regardless of our views on the war . It is not a debt that can await the slow return of " full employment " or " stable prices , " both of which may be far down the road . Many of them are going to be mental casualties or even prisoners of war at home : restless , frustrated and ' out of work . The Government , of course , is conscious of all this . There is a demobiliW AS Fr I AT G7- CP 1V " zation program designed to ease the transition back to civilian life , hospital care for the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help for the dope addicts ? even a careful security watch , just in case  --  but the sum of all this Is pitifully small compared with the magnitude of the problem . Lately there has been a lot of talk in Washington about priorities , allocation of resources , revenue sharing and local responsibility for local problems . The Congress is deeply divided on all these . The Senate has not even been able to agree on its own rules of procedure , let alone getting down to legislating on urgent questions of policy . The returning veterans , however , are a special question , a first priority , an obvious test for revenue sharing and local responsibility , and they need Federal money and special local help much faster than they are getting it . now . What is happening in most cases , despite the help of veterans ' organizations and Federal assistance , is that most of them are thrown in with the rest of the unemployed to seek jobs or welfare as best they can , During the autumn months of 1970 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , partly as a result of returning vet ? erans , and the increase already threatens to drive welfare costs at least $1.5 billion above the estimates in President Nixon 's 1972 budget . In explaining the steep rise in the nation 's unemployed during the last year , the Administration has " blamed " much of it on the reduction in the armed forces and the layoffs in factories working for the Pentagon , but very little has been said of the human plight of the returning veterans . The politics of this problem are not an insuperable barrier . Few Federal legislators of whatever persuasion are prepared to vote against appropriations for veterans ' jobs , even if this means financing public-service work under the states , cities , counties and municipalities of the country . Meanwhile , much could he done by private employers in every community , if separate lists of local veterans were compiled and local committees were established to help employ the veterans as a first priority . At the present time , the major complaint in Washington , both in the executive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel trapped in vast controversies and can not get action on new welfare , housing or job  --  training projects . On the conduct of the war , there is of course a bitter stalemate . On the conditions of a negotiated peace and on the future of Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos it is the same . But the problem of the veterans is not a major divisive issue . The debt and the danger are widely recognized , but somehow they have been shoved aside by the more dramatic political and economic arguments . Seldom a speech is made here about the war without verbal tribute being paid to the men of the expeditionary force , and to the extraordinary sacrifices they have made under conditions unprecedented in the history of the armed forces , But this does not really help the veterans . They need money and jobs , and the cost of providing them is likely to be far less in the long run than the cost of paying for the consequences of indifference .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
