A pair of aces at Indiana State <P> Tops in their sports , two remarkable stars with remarkably different styles are brightening the long winter in Terre Haute : <P> LARRY BIRD . Watching him play stirs pleasant memories for basketball purists : not only can he shoot and rebound as well as the game 's legendary forwards ; he is an old-fashioned playmaker , a passer who can look one way and hit the open man breaking for the hoop . Averaging 28.6 points a game , Larry Bird , 22 , is the second leading college scorer and stands third in rebounds . What is more , he has led his hitherto obscure team through a schedule that reads like the mail drops on the midnight train to Yuma-Wichita State , Tulsa , West Texas State , New Mexico State-and arrived at the top of last week 's Associated Press national rankings . <P> Plenty for any collegian to crow about , but Bird maintains a strange public silence . Claiming he was misquoted last fall , Bird has steadfastly refused to talk to the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio representatives . " A lot of sportswriters ask you who your girlfriend is and things like that , " Bird has said . " I do n't want to talk about personal things . Basketball , that 's what I 'm here for . " <P> The 6-ft. 9-in . Bird was a model of calm consistency in last week 's 100-75 victory over West Texas . He effortlessly scored 27 points , grabbed 19 rebounds and passed brilliantly . " You ca n't take your eyes off him one second or he 'll hit you in the face with the ball , " says Teammate Carl Nicks . Three nights later , Bird registered 20 points and 13 rebounds as Indiana State ran its record to 24-0 with a 69-68 win over Southern Illinois . Still , Bird-when he talks-is frank enough to say , " It 's great to be No. 1 , but I do n't think we have the best team in the country . " <P> Bird may be weak on defense and a bit slow afoot , but neither shortcoming should prevent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Celtics drafted Bird last year as a junior and have until June 24 to sign him . The team has gone out of its way to acquire Jeff Judkins and Rick Robey , both friends of Bird 's , an obvious effort to feather a nest for him in Boston . Says Celtic Player-Coach Dave Cowens : " He 's unselfish , he can pass , and he does n't mind mixing it up underneath . " <P> If the Celtics do not succeed in signing Bird by June 24 , they lose all rights to him , and he will be picked again - probably first-in this year 's draft , which will be held the next day . In addition to his varied skills , Bird has one other box office advantage for pro owners in a game increasingly dominated by blacks : he is white . <P> Given his dislike of flying , sportswriters , big cities and public attention , the shy , blond sharpshooter knows his adjustment to the National Basketball Association could be painful . As he plays the packed arenas of the heartland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be savoring what may be the best days of his life .
