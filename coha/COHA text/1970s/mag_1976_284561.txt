" There 's no such thing as an undiscovered paradise , " says a California real estate man named Karel van Haefton . " There is only a paradise that someone has found and wants to sell . " He should know . At 29 , Van Haefton is founder and owner of a most unusual realty company . Operating out of a handsome houseboat on Sausalito 's waterfront , it is called Rare Earth Realty , and it sells the kind of land that some people consider , well , paradise . <P> For those who want their own secluded beaches badly enough , Rare Earth offers 2,700 acres of Caribbean frontage in Colombia ( asking price : $1,700,000 ) , 454 acres on a Fiji island ( $1 million ) or 30 acres in Tahiti ( $150,000 ) . Mountaintop retreats ? Van Haefton has 20 of them . Also an Indian burial ground in California , a 1,400-acre canyon in Mexico , an obsolete ICBM base in New York State . As for whole islands , Rare Earth lists 400 for sale , including , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $16,000 and another in the British Virgins for $8 million . " <P> The firm prides itself in finding what the client wants , usually by asking the target area 's Chamber of Commerce , realty groups , press and political organizations for help . If that fails , Van Haefton turns to maps , marine charts , atlases - anything that shows property to fill the need-or even occasionally slogs through the countryside himself . Right now he is searching California for a " Tibetan-type monastery " for the Hare Krishna sect and has no doubts that a reasonable facsimile will turn up . <P> Four months ago , a man came to Rare Earth with a request to be sovereign of an island . After some work , Van Haefton found that the Fiji government owned uninhabited islands that were so remote that it would consider selling them , sovereignty along with the deed . <P> The son of a Dutch diplomat , Van Haefton lived in Europe , Asia and Africa before entering the University of California at Berkeley in 1966 . After graduating , he went into real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , but he soon decided that " selling houses in San Francisco was no fun . " So he broadened his view to encompass the world and opened his esoteric firm in 1974 . <P> Brisk Business . " It took us a while to get known , " he says . But business is now brisk ; whereas Rare Earth had to sell 20 properties in 1975 to gross $700,000 , just three of the ten properties it has sold this year brought in the same amount . Still , profit margins are thin because overhead runs about $5,000 a month . That includes base salaries for Van Haefton and his wife ( six other employees work on straight commission ) , heavy advertising expenses and a lot of travel . <P> Abroad , Van Haefton has had to learn to measure in carres in Costa Rica and manzanas in Colombia . Harder yet is researching property deeds to make sure that the land 's seller is also its legal owner . But now that Van Haefton knows foreign realty , he plans to appeal to foreign buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . What German industrialists , Greek shipowners and perhaps oil sheiks want , he believes , might just be a trout farm nestling in California 's Lassen National Forest , a fly-in ranch in lush green Montana or a splendid 240-acre swamp in Florida .
