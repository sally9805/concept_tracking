' Governor Rockefeller 's plan for a $265-million " total war " against narcotics abuse by youths under 16 years of age , which was announced on Tuesday , was sharply criticized during the hearing . Political opponents of the Governor and directors of programs dealing with drug addiction labeled the proposal as " election-year gimmickry " and said that the plan would provide more buildings to house addicts but little money for treating their problem . " In his recent announcement the Governor has come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant proposals , " Nassau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson , a Democratic candidate for goiernor , told the legislators .

" A Democratic City Councilman , Carter Burden , who also testified at the hearing , labeled the Governor 's proposal a " package of deceptions " instead of the " program for action " as it was described in the Governor 's announcement . Bond Market Cited " The vast bulk of the Governor 's new financial assistance program allocated for locally sponsored treatment centers is , I 'm afraid , more fond hope than hard cash , " Mr. Burden said . " It is virtually impossible to float any bond issue in today 's market , let alone one for addiction treatment centers .

They estimated that there were more than 25,000 youngsters in this age bracket who were experimenting with drugs or who were already drug addicts . Dr. Densen-Gerber said the Governor 's proposal was a continuation of hiss " edifice complex " because the bulk of the funds were earmarked for buildings instead of treatment . " We do n't need buildings , " she said . " We need bedtime stories . The state owes it to the Ralphies to cure them . "
