A New Congress <P> To the Editors : <P> A Congress Jan. 23 with independence , more democratic procedures and faster turnover among its members sounds encouraging . However , I wonder about their making decisions that play well with the folks back home . When we want both increased Government services and decreased taxes , it must be hard to decide how to vote . I hope Congress will provide more leadership . We ca n't have it both ways , and it 's time someone told us . <P> Betty Noling <P> Shorewood , Wis . <P> While the intent of the recent shift of power from the White House to Congress is to improve and democratize our Government , it does not always work out that way . Senators and Congressmen seldom rise above the interests of their constituents , whereas the President is more likely to act in the interest of all the people . <P> Jacob Weitzer <P> North Miami Beach <P> This good story did n't bring tears of sympathy to my eyes . As for Congressmen " being watched more closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " It 's about time . " <P> Richard K. Kaminski <P> Mount Lebanon , Pa . <P> I find it ironic and pitiable that the Senate majority leader " would n't enjoy going away and doing nothing . " For I concur with the Roman statesman Cicero , who said , " He does not seem to me to be a free man who does not sometimes do nothing . " <P> Linda J. Zaleski <P> Pittsburgh <P> Your comment that I have " far more clout " as ranking minority member on the Senate Human Resources Committee than the committee 's chairman , Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr . of New Jersey , is wrong and misleading . <P> " Pete " Williams is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent , effective and humane legislators on labor and the other major concerns of the committee in Senate history . <P> He and I have forged a uniquely bipartisan partnership over the years as the committee , under his inspired leadership , has developed bills to better the lot of millions of American working men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the principal sponsor . <P> Jacob K. Javits <P> U.S. Senator , New York <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Violence in the Schools <P> In " The ABCs of School Violence " Jan. 23 , the writer says : " American parents and educators have yet to figure out a way of making respect for authority and for others part of every student 's education . " Every teacher will scream at that statement . <P> Students ' education begins at home . <P> ( Mrs. ) Charlotte E. Reeder <P> Clarksville , Md . <P> The general lack of respect for teachers exists because students know that law requires juveniles to stay in school . <P> American children should be entitled to free education only if they want it . <P> Chuck Reeder Narberth , Pa . <P> How shocking it is that we tend to ignore the rights of teachers and overemphasize the rights of students ! Will union contracts begin to demand combat pay ? It is not too far off . <P> Richard Dean Mazer <P> Pittsburgh <P> As a junior high school teacher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been assaulted four times-three times by parents or older siblings .
