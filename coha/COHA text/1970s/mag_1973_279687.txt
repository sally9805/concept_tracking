SAVE THE TIGER . Jack Lemmon wakes in the morning screaming-and he is worse off than he knows . Before the day is out he will have to see about having his clothing factory in Long Beach burned for the insurance money ; introduce the new fall line of Capri Casuals ; endure a brief nervous breakdown ; inhale a joint or two of cannabis ; sleep with an aging love child off the Sunset Strip ; dream of a pop apocalypse populated by everyone from Bobby Kennedy to James Earl Ray ; and recite lines like " I wan na walk in the kind of rain that never washes perfume away . " Under the circumstances , that gully of sweat staining the back of his pajamas is certainly understandable . <P> Lemmon , rather less febrile here than usual , portrays Harry Stoner , a middle-aged businessman of average rapacity who has fallen victim to anomie and his accountant . Down at Capri Casuals , money is as scarce as affection at Harry 's house . His only child , a daughter , is away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not exercised their connubial rights in some time . Harry ca n't stand it . But it is also difficult to stand Harry . His soulless soliloquies and fearless superficiality thoroughly sour the movie . <P> Director John Avildsen , who made Joe , continues to prove himself a master of the visual cliche , the low-slung symbol and the stereophonic anticlimax . He is abetted by Scenarist Steve Shagan , a sort of drip-dry Clifford Odets , who puts klieg lights around every metaphor . According to the credits , Shagan also functioned as the producer . Considering the results , that is a little like running off your unpublishable novel on your own vanity press . <P> UNDER MILK WOOD . Dylan Thomas wrote this verse play , as he put it , " for voices . " The images that Director Andrew Sinclair has added to his film adaptation do not complement Thomas ' language ; they detract from it . The language that comes cascading off the sound track is bottled into florid captions for an illustrated travel guide to Wales . Whenever Sinclair is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will not do for Richard Burton merely to read the first voice . He must appear , all rumpled and dour and selfabsorbed , like some wandering Welshman cursed to travel the countryside until he discovers his spiritual roots . Besides Burton , the cast boasts Elizabeth Taylor , playing Polly Garter as she might have looked if she worked Miami Beach at $100 a trick ; Peter O'Toole , who appears to have dashed right over from the set of Man of La Mancha , still wearing his same makeup ; and various excellent character actors like Vivien Merchant , Glynis Johns and Victor Spinetti . The film is actually brief , but it seems ruthlessly long , like being trapped in an endless high school assembly .
