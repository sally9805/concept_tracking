txt The folks at Uncle Bill 's discount store here laid in 216 five-gallon gasoline cans not long ago . Sonic thought it was a 90-day supply . They were fits lays off . " You better believe it makes sense to me " that all 216 cans were sold in two days , says Bill Perkins , manager of the store 's auto-parts department . It makes sense to Mr. Perkins because he recently bought six cans himself ? boosting his private holdings to 13 . He says he has filled the 13 with 65 gallons of gasoline . Thousands of Americans are beginning to think and act like Bill Perkins in this era of fuel scarcity Following the example set earlier by industry , they are hoarding fuel  --  mostly gasoline , although rumor has it that some home owners are also stocking up on home heating oil and even firewood . And while there is n't anything illegal about hoarding per se , much of the consumer hoarding of fuels appears to be illegal under local fire codes . Like most hoarders , Mr. Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of arousing fire marshals or thieves . But he does n't make a secret of his reasoning . " I 've got to drive back and forth to work , " he says . " I drive 37 miles each way and get about 12 miles to the gallon . I 'm afraid the rationing they 're talking about probably wo n't be enough for me . " " Tom , Dick and Harry " Nobody knows just how many individuals are hoarding fuel or how many gallons may be stored in garages and elsewhere . But talks with dozens of hoarders , gas-pump attendants , gas-can salesmen , fire officials and other sources indicate that the number has soared since President Nixon proposed the 27-hour ban on weekend gasoline sales . The ban is voluntary at the moment , pending passage of legislation ordering it . Clearly the trend is nationwide . In recent days , most of the fuel-container inventories carried by retailers and distributors have been bought out . " The demand is significantly greater than you 'd expect , " says a spokesman for Sears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a small percentage increase  --  these things are moving . The market is hot as a firecracker . " Adds an official of George Worthington Co. , a Cleveland hardware distributor : " Now that gasoline stations are going to be closed on Sunday , every Tom , Dick and Harry wants a fivegallon gasoline can . " Retailers , in fact , have been largely unable to meet demand . An executive of Cleveland 's Memphis Hardware says , " We just ordered two dozen five-gallon cans from a distributor . But they canceled the order . They 're out of stock . " As a result of orders double the expected pace , warehouses of Standard Oil Co . ( Ohio ) have been emptied of five-gallon containers intended for kerosene and fuel oil . " I do n't think there 's a five-gallon can left in the whole city of Cleveland , " says Mr. Perkins of Uncle Bill 's , a division of Cook United Inc. 55 Gallons , Please Gas-station attendants confirm that countless drivers are coming in with extra containers ; some carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers have no nroblem getting the extra fuel , though some gas stations do draw the line somewhere . " This guy came in the other day with a 55-gallon barrel and wanted me to fill it up with diesel , " says an attendant at Ecke 's Service Station near downtown Cleveland . " I told him no soap , that I 'd sell him 15 gallons  --  but that was it . " The customer settled for the 15 gallons . Gas-station owners and attendants all say they expect hoarding to become more widespread , especially since it appears that prices may streak further upward . They also suggest that a minor crime wave might develop if people try to steal gas from one another by siphoning it off . Hardware stores already report booming sales of siphon pumps and rubber tubing . Moreover , automotive suppliers say sales of gas caps that you can lock are soaring . A Ford Motor Co. spokesman says twice as many of the caps are being sold this year , presumably because of fear of thieves . " We ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoarders are snowmobile owners worried about their recreation this winter and yachtsmen worried about their recreation next summer . Sometimes the stash is only a few gallons , sometimes a few hundred . Boll Out the Barrel Tactics and techniques vary . One man who works at a Cleveland publishing concern took home a 55-gallon drum In which his employer had received chemicals ; lie set the drum on sawhorses in his two-car garage . Then he visited five hardware and discount stores trying to buy five-gallon cans . " My idea was to get 10 extra gallons every time I had my car filled up and store them in the barrel , " he says . But the stores were all sold out of five-gallon cans , so he settled for three 2-gallon cans . With the help of the cans and a siphon to trpnsfer some fuel from his car to the cans and then to the barrel , lie figures his barrel will be full " inside of two weeks if I keep nt it . " Equally diligent are the snowmobllers , who fear they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manuel , partner in a recreationalvehicle dealership near Pontiac , Mich. , says the dealership has sold at least two dozen 40-gallon fuel containers to snowmobile customers . " Without the gas shortage we might have sold one or two , " he adds . Mr. Manuel speaks with authority , for he knows firsthand whore the priorities of snowmobilere lie . Ho says ho and his father just spent four days installing and filling a 100-gallon underground tank at a cabin they use as snowmobile base , then they had a 50-gallon ontainer tilled at a gas station and hauled it 150 miles to the a bin . " It 's been a bit of an in ( onvemere e , you might say , " says Mr. Manuel . but it 'll he worth it if gasoline is rationed We 'll still be able to ride our snowmobiles " Reasoning like th at IS shared by boat owner , who are sywi reling away gasoline for next summer . One Midwest businessman stored his 37-foot yaa ht for the winter with the tanks full , rather than empty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pleasure boating may be a thing of the past by next summer , " he says , " but I have a big investment in my boat , and the only way I can be sure I 'll be able to use it at all is to store it with the fuel in it " The boat 's tanks hold 200 gallons , more than enough to assure that the boat can be moved from its - winter quarters to a yacht club , where it could at least be used as " a summer cottage " if fuel for bo ating is n't available , says the boat 's owner . Like most hoar derv , the boating enthusiast insists on : anonymity " Th-s could be adverse publn ity for me personally , " he says . Publicity appears to have deterred at least one would-be hoarder. ft , a ording to news ports , which are- a onfirmed by a ? impany spokesman , W. P Tavoulareas , president of Mobil Oil Corp. , had planned to replace a 550-gallon fuel-oil tank at his Long Island home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install a 1,000-gallon gasoline tank someday . But when reports of Mr Tavoulareas 's plans appeared in newspapers , the storage scheme was abruptly halted . More numerous than the hoarders with a fairly sizable stash are those with just a few gallons . These people tend to be somewhat more open about their activities . Olin M. King , a 47-year-old sixth-grade teacher in suburban Cleveland , just bought a five-gallon gasoline can , which he had filled and keeps in his garage Sitting in his living room , which is furnished with antique rugs , ( - locks and chairs , Mr. King explains that he frequently does a lot of driving on Sundays to get to antique shows Now if a Sunday trip almost drains his tank , he will have the five gallons available on Monday morning . " It 's a kind of insuram e , " he says Ready for Florida Unlike Mr. King , many motorists are actually carrying their extra few gallons with them in the trunks of their cars , and others have even more elaborate schemes for beating the Sunday closings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mich. , installed an extra 50-gallon gas tank in his 31-foot motor home , doubling its capacity . " I 'm going to Florida over Christmas , and I 'll be able to drive all day without having to refuel , " he says . " I wo n't have to buy any gas on a Sunday . " The motor home is already gassed up and ready to go . The gas hoarders , large and small , are already arousing opposition on two fronts  --  from people who think hoarding is selfish and unpatriotic and from people who figure it is downright dangerous to store gasoline and other fuels . In the first category is Charles W. Majewski , race director of the North Kent Snowmobilers , a group of Michigan enthusiasts . The club has urged its members to use 155 less fuel than last year and to refrain from hoarding . " As far as snowmobilers are concerned we do n't have a very good public image as it is , " he says , " so I do n't think it would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse than it is now " In the second category are most of the nation 's firefighters and safety officials . They fear ? justifiably if sonic recent mishaps are indicative of coming things  --  that all the extra gasoline in the hands of consumers who do n't recognize the highly volatile nature of the fuel will lead to fires , explosions and poisonings . To demonstrate the explosive qualities of gasoline , the New York City Fire Department recently conducted an outdoor press conference at which firemen ignited five gallons of gasoline In the trunk of an Oldsmobile . It Sticks of Dynamite " If you 'd been driving and had that happen , you would n't have had a chance to get out , " says Robert Perez , a Fire Department official . " The whole car was consumed in a matter of seconds . " Mr. Perez says a comparable blaze would be likely in any " rather routine " rearend collision involving a car with fuel in a can in the trunk . The National Safety Council , fearing widespread hoarding , recently issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one gallon of gasoline has been compared to 14 sticks of dynamite . " One risk run by hoarders is that home insurance policies may not cover damages . Pennsylvania 's insurance commissioner , Herbert S. Denenberg , says that most homeowners and fire policies carry a standard provision denying coverage if " the hazard is increased by means within the control or knowledge of the insured . " Evidence is mounting almost daily that the fuel shortage and hoarding are already factors in serious injuries and deaths . A 16-year-old Temple Hills , Md , boy is in serious condition following an accident in Vienna , Va , Dec. 1 . Authorities say that with gas stations closed , the youth did n't have enough fuel to return home from a friend 's house . Apparently the youth tried to siphon some fuel from his friend 's car , and in the process Wiled a match to see what he was doing in the dark The gasoline ignited , resulting in third-degree burns over 905a of his body . In Erie , Pa. , Richard Trojan , a 28-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of Dec. 3 when his ear ran off the road into it drainage ditch Police say the car had been outfitted with an extra 20-gallon gas tank and carried two two-gallon cans and one five-gallon can of gasoline in the trunk .

Metal police report : " As the operator spun the tires trying to get out of the ditch , the gas ignited anal the car became engulfed in flames .
