 | AMERICAS FOREIGN POLICY : A RAKE 'S PROGRESS @# THE INCREASINGLY DISSOLUTE course of American foreign policy makes it difficult to characterize the spectacle of the United States in the world as anrything other than a rake 's progress . The country exhibits itself in the persona of a profligate heir , squandering his fortune in gambling hells and on speculations in organic farming and utopian politics . Bearing this portrait in mind , I can make sense of the accounts in the newspapers . Otherwise I 'm at a loss to know what people mean when they talk about mutual-defense treaties , hegemonies , the China card , and arcs of crisis in Asia Minor and the Persian Gulf . On reading the communiques from Washington , Peking , and Teheran ( together with the supporting sophistry on the editorial pages of the New York Times ) , I see a soft-faced man in a nightclub at three A. M. , earnestly seeking to persuade a bored demimondaine that he still worries about the higher things in life and that his inheritance has failed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hear him saying , in a blurred but concerned voice , that he means to do what 's right , but that this is a much harder thing to do than perhaps the young lady knows . He would have preferred ' o become a poet or a Protestant minister , or possibly a guitar player hitchhiking across Arkansas with a girl who sings country songs . But his lawyers keep talking to him about the Russians ( the boring , tedious Russians , who never laugh at his jokes ) , and his trust officers keep talking to him about money ? about the goddam price of oil and the second-rate Shah who let him down in Iran , about the Chinese and the Japanese and the Taiwanese and the Vietnamese ( all of whom look so much alike that it 's hard to remember which ones are floating around in boats ) , and about the miserable Jews who failed him in the Middle East . The persona of the spendthrift heir seems to be fitting because in 1945 the United States inherited the earth . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers twice attempted suicide , and at the end of World War II what was left of Western civilization passed into the American account . " The war also had prompted the country to invent a miraculous economic machine that seemed @#  | to grant as many wishes as were asked of it . The continental United States had escaped the plague of war , and so it was easy enough for the heirs to believe that they had been anointed by God . In their eager innocence , they made of foreign policy a game of transcendental poker , in which the ruthless selfinterest of a commercial democracy ( cf. , the American policy toward the Plains Indians and the Mexicans ) got mixed up with dreams , sermons , and the transmigration of souls . In Europe people may not know very much about foreign policy ; as often as not they have no idea what to do about any particular crisis , but at least they can recognize the subjects under discussion . They know enough to know that the dealing between nations is a dull and sluggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual displays of pride , greed , nastiness , and spite . The @# Americans , who have little interest in tiresome details , prefer to imagine themselves playing cards with the Devil . @# THE WEALTH of the United States in comparison to other nations of the world makes the figure of the rich man representative of the country 's gargantuan extravagance . As the inheritors became increasingly profligate ( cf. , the rising levels of consumption , inflation , and debt through the 1960s ) , so also the assumptions of pecuniary privilege became habitual among larger segments of the population . I first encountered the prevailing attitude of mind in the fall of 1957 , when , having studied history for a year in England , I returned to the United States with the notion of working for either the Washington Post or the CIA . My interest in foreign affairs had been awakened by the Suez and Hungarian incidents of 1956 and by my inability to understand , much less explain to a crowd of indignant Englishmen , the policy of John Foster Dulles . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different departments of the same corporation . Newspapermen traded rumors with intelligence agents , and although the gilding on the Pax Americana was beginning to wear a little thin . anybody who had been to Yale in the early 1950s could n't help thinking the totalitarian hordes had to be prevented from sacking the holy cities of Christendom . Failing to find a job with the Post , I took the examinations for the CIA . These lasted a week , and afterward I was summoned to a preliminary interview with four or five young men introduced to me as " some of the junior guys . " The interview took place in one of the temporary buildings put up during World War II in the vicinity of the Lincoln Memorial . The feeling of understated grandeur , of a building hastily assembled for an urgent , imperial purpose . was further exaggerated by the studied carelessness of the young men who asked the questions . All of them seemed to have graduated from Yale , and so they questioned me about whom I had known at New Haven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss military history and the risings of the Danube ; instead I found myself trying to remember the names of the girls who sailed boats off Fishers Island , or who had won the summer tennis tournaments in Southampton and Bedford Hills . As the conversation drifted through the ritual of polite inanity ( about " personal goals " and " one 's sense of achievement in life " ) , the young men every now and then exchanged an enigmatic reference to " that  | damn thing in Laos . " Trying very hard not to be too obvious about it , they gave me to understand that they were playing the big varsity game of the Cold War . Before I got up to leave , apologizing for having applied to the wrong office , I understood that I had been invited to drop around to the common room of the best fraternity in the world so that the admissions committee could find out if I was " the right sort . " From that day forward I have never been surprised by the news of the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the best intentions in the world and convinced of their moral and social primogeniture , must be expected to make a few good-natured mistakes . If their innocent enthusiasm sometimes degenerates into sadism , well , that also must be expected . Nobody becomes more spiteful than the boy next door jilted by the beautiful Asian girl , especially after he has given her the beach house at Camranh Bay , $100 million in helicopters , and God knows how much in ideological support . It is a bitter thing to lose to Princeton and to find out that not even Dink Stover can make the world safe from Communism . This same undergraduate insouciance has remained characteristic of American foreign policy for the past thirty years . Administrations have come and gone , and so have enemies and allies , but the attitude of mind remains constant , and so does the tone of voice . It is the voice of Henry Kissinger explaining to a lady at a dinner that a nation , like an ambitious Georgetown hostess , can not afford to invite unsuccessful people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy , who told an audience of scholars in the early 1960s that he was getting out of Latin American studies because Latin America was such a second-rate place . It is the voice of James Reston finding something pleasant to say about this year 's congenial dictator , or the State Department announcing its solidarity with Cambodia and expressing only mild regret about the regime 's program of genocide . After 1968 the inflection of the voice became slightly more irritable and petulant . During the early years of the decade the heir to the estate flattered himself with the gestures and exuberant rhetoric appropriate to an opulent idealism . He had access to unlimited resources ( of moral authority as well as cash ) , and he stood willing to invest in anybody 's scheme of political liberty . Nothing was too difficult or too expensive ; no war or rural electrification was too small or inconsequential . The young heir undertook to invade Asia and to provide guns and wheat and computer tech-@# nology to any beggar who stopped him in the street and asked him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things turned a little sour , the heir began muttering about scarcity and debts , about the damage done to the environment and the lack of first-class accommodation on spaceship earth . Nobody becomes more obsessive on the subject of money than the rich man who has suffered a financial loss . The fellow feels himself impoverished because he , has to sell the yacht . President Nixon closed the gold window , and associate professors of social criticism dutifully taught their students that sometimes money weighs more heavily in the balance of human affairs than the romance of the zeitgeist . Even so , the assumptions of entitlement remain intact . Although feeling himself somewhat diminished ( as witness the success of the philosopher-merchants on the neoconservative Right ) and somewhat older ( as witness the dependence on sexual and spiritual rubber goods ) , the still-prodigal son continues to believe himself possessed of unlimited credit . He is still the heir to the fortune , no matter what anybody says about his horses and dogs , and he can damn well play his game of policy in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace begets a number of corollary attitudes , all of them as characteristic of a rich man going about his toys and pleasures as of the manner in which the United States conducts its foreign affairs . As follows : I. The world as theater CHILDREN ENCOURAGED to imagine themselves either rich or beautiful assume that nothing else will be required of them . What is important is the appearance of things , and if these can be properly maintained , then the heirs can look forward to a sequence of pleasant invitations . They will be entitled to a view from the box seats , and from the box seats , as every fortunate child knows , the world arranges itself into a decorous panorama . The point of view assumes that Australians will play tennis , that Italians will sing or kill one another , that Negroes will dance or riot ( always at a safe distance ) , and that the holders of the season tickets will live happily ever after , or , if they are very , very rich , maybe forever . The complacence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on the program . Nobody imagines that he can be dislodged by a social upheaval of no matter what force or velocity , and it is taken for granted that the embarrassments of death or failure will be vis- "  | ited upon people to whom one has never been properly introduced . Since the end of World War II the people who make American foreign policy have assumed that the world is so much painted scenery . The impresarios in Washington assign all the parts and write all the last acts . Other people make exits and entrances . Thus President Carter , on the last night of 1977 , offered a toast to the Shah of Iran in which he described the Shah as his " great friend " and Iran as an " island of stability " in the Middle East . " A year later Iran was in the midst of revolt and Washington was advising the Shah to abdicate in favor of any government , civil or military , Lewis H. Lapham AMERICA 'S FOREIGN POLICY : A RAKE 'S PROGRESS @# that could restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union appeared on the stage in the role of brave friend and courageous ally ; six years later , the script was rewritten and the Soviet Union appeared as the villainous eminence grise , subverting the free world with the drug of Communism . China remained an implacable enemy of human freedom for the better part of thirty years , but in 1972 President Nixon announced the advent of democracy , and in 1978 Pre -- ident Carter proclaimed the miracle of redemption . Following the example set by the wall posters in Peking , the American pre -- blossomed with praise for a regime previouslv celebrated for its brutality . The stagehands of the media took down the sets left over from the production of Darkness at Noon and replaced them with tableaux of happy Chine-e workers eager to buy farm implements , military aircraft , and Coca-Cola . In war , Napoleon once said , the greatest sin is to make pictures . But the man who has inherited a great fortune does nothing else except make pictures . Unlike the poor man . who must study other people 's motives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich man can afford to look only at what amuses or comforts him . He believewhat he is told because he has no reason not to do so . What difference does it make ? If everything is make-believe , then everything is as plausible as everything else . Asian dictators can promise to go among their peasant= and instruct them in the mechanics of constitutional self-government ; the Shah of Iran can say he means to make a democratic state among people who believe that they have won the blessing of Allah by burning to death 400 schoolchildren in a movie theater . The rich man applauds , admires the native costumes , and sends a gift of weapons . He believes that . once inspired by the American example , the repentant Asian despot will feel himself inwardly changed and seek to imitate the model of behavior established by Henry Cabot Lodge . Dictators do n't really want to he dictators ; they were raised in an unhealthy social environment , and if given enough tractors and a little moral encouragement , they will renounce the pleasures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor in Washington over the past thirty years resemble the farfetched rationalizations with which New York art dealers sell the latest school of modern painting to the nouveau riche . Like the visitors from abroad , the dealers retain a serene and justified confidence in the customer 's willingness to be deceived .  | II . The habit of inattention THE PRESS and the politicians sometimes blame the CIA for being so poorly informed , not only about the events in Iran but also about events in China , Russia , Africa , and Vietnam . The recriminations seem to me unfair . The inattention of the CIA reflects and embodies the carelessness of the society for which it acts as agent . On leaving his club the rich man never looks behind him to see if the waiter is holding his coat ; in much the same way the United States does n't take the trouble to notice much of what goes on in the world 's servants ' quarters . The American press reports news from Africa that deals with disputes between whites and blacks ; only large-scale civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then only if the Russians agree to sponsor one of the contenders . The rich man never knows why other people do what they do because it never occurs to him that they have obligations to anybody other than himself . Few among the nation 's more prominent journalists speak or read French . It would exceed the bounds of all decent patriotism to expect more than two or three of them to read or speak Russian . Chinese , or Arabic . The same thing can be said for members of Congress , for Presidents , Secretaries of State , ministers of defense , and almost the entire cadre of people who give shape and form to the discussion of foreign policy . Whenever I remark too loudly on the magnificent displays of American ignorance , somebody who has published an article in Foreign Affairs reminds me that the United States is the last , best hope of earth . This is undoubtedly true , but it has nothing to do with the subjects under discussion . III . Wastefulness WHEN PRESIDENT CARTER announced the Christmas demarche to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States had failed to gain any specific advantage from the deal . The United States ceased to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state , abrogated the defense treaty , and agreed to withdraw its troops from the island . In return for these concessions , the Communist Chinese promised to be as friendly as possible and to do what they thought best for the Taiwanese . The people who object to the slackness of this bargain overlook the rich man 's unwill-@# " ingness to set a vulgar price on metaphysics . The United States habitually makes poor bargains because it feels that it already owns everything worth owning , and so why haggle with the poor little fellows in Asia and the Middle East ? Why make unreasonable demands on the Soviets in the SALT negotiations ? It is the proof of a rich man 's freedom that he can afford to pay an excessive price . It never occurs to him that political economy might be a form of destruction as ruthless although not quite so obvious as war , or that the world is full of hungry people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich man considers it the height of fashion and good breeding to affect an aristocratic disdain for commerce . Thus a rich nation 's portfolio of treaties resembles a rich man 's stock portfolio . It is full of issues that he inherited from his grandfather or his mother 's uncles , and he has trouble remembering the assets and liabilities represented by NATO , SEATO , CENTO , and God knows how many other shares and securities for which he ca n't even recall the names . This explains his careless disregard for those countries denominated as allies . To the extent that none of them take precedence over any of the others , they can be bought and sold as the heir feels himself pressed by the need for cash or funds with which to stage an extravagant fireworks display . " The habit of mind remains firmly ingrained despite the depleted value of the heir 's investments . At the end of 1972 foreign banking interests controlled American assets of $26.8 billion ; in 1978 the same interests controlled American assets worth $98 billion . During the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured goods in the amount of $37 billion , as opposed to only $16 billion for foreign oil . The dollar continues to depreciate in the world markets , and American multinational corporations have begun to find themselves surpassed by their competitors in France , Germany , and Japan . But the rich man intent upon his game of policy impatiently dismisses the accountants niggling at his sleeve . He feels compelled to place another bet in Indochina , this time backing the Cambodians ( i.e. , the friends of his new partners , the Communist Chinese ) against the malevolent croupiers in Vietnam . He wants  | to make a grand and humanistic gesture in southern Africa , to do something visible and significant in Turkey , to effect a rapprochement in Central America . As recently as last summer , while listening to people with impeccable credentials discuss the prospects of American diplomacy , I heard a man say that nothing could happen in the world that could affect , in any serious way , the United States . Excepting only a nuclear miscalculation , he was happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immunity I N AMERICAN military circles , I 'm told , it is considered poor form to discuss fortification and the strategies of attrition and civil defense . The whole notion of fortification is seen as stodgy , corrupting , somehow un-American . It brings to mind the depressing memory of stuffy French generals on the Maginot Line in the early weeks of World War II . The United States owes it to itself to cut a more dashing figure in the world . Where is the fun in fighting dreary rearguard actions ? The young men in the Pentagon and the military academies speak of forward thrusts , of broad-gauged advances , of assaults and landings and insertions . All the fine talk conceals an ironic paradox . When it comes down to a question of how to go about these romantic maneuvers , the United States relies less on the daring and intelligence of its commanders than on the superiority of its expensive equipment . It is assumed that the wars will be won by the avalanche of American resources , materiel , production , logistics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be neither impetuous nor brave . The faith in gadgetry and the " tech fix " accounts for the incalculable investment in missiles , bombs , airplanes , and anything else that can be bought in the finest sporting-goods stores . Nobody has the bad manners to insist that strategic bombing has yet to be proved a decisive factor in any of the century 's wars . The rich man depends on his technology in the same way that he depends on his trust fund . Even if he makes no effort to think about the great bulk of his capital , it goes about the business of gathering its daily ransom of interest and dividends . The miraculous nature of this contrivance persuades the heir to believe in the divinity of machines . His lack of acquaintance with the domesticity of war gives him further reason to think that he may have been granted an exemption from the scourges by which less fortunate  | @# men sometimes find themselves humiliated . The world is object , and the United States is subject , the fighting always takes place on somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England suffered the terror of the German bombing ; in Moscow the present members of the Politburo watched German tank commanders sight their guns on the spires of the Kremlin . Their peers in Germany , China , Japan , and Italy all carry with them the memory of wives , fathers , brothers . and children killed by the armies of liberation . But in the United States these are tales that are told . Perhaps this is why the Americans were obliged to push the Vietnamese off the helicopters rising from the roof of the American embassy in Saigon . They had n't been taught that defeats were as plausible as victories , and so they did n't know how to manage a courageous retreat . V. Hypochondria THE DISEASE IS popular with the rich because only the rich can afford it and because , being incurable , it gives them a constant occasion to talk about themselves . Never before in its history has the United States been so heavily armed a nation . and yet the newspapers and the literary gazettes ceaselessly bring reports of helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the encroaching shadow of Soviet hegemony . The fear of death provides a further excuse for the feverish rates of spending and the extravagant consumption of the estate 's assets . Eat , drink , and be merry , for tomorrow we may have to pay one dollar for a gallon of gasoline and give up our chalets in Aspen . Like the society physicians who prev upon the anxieties of dowager heiresses , the learned doctors of foreign policy subtly remind the trembling patient of the illnesses that can befall the unwary traveler in the Third World who strays too far from supplies of safe drinking water . The symptoms of hypochondria have been chronic since the early 1950s . The moods of euphoria and exultation ( " How dare they defy us , those scrawny little peasants in Vietnam ? " periodically give way to seizures of doubt and self-reproach . For no apparent reason , the stewards of the American empire suddenly become preoccupied with the phantoms of the missile gap or the energy crisis . Every noi. and then the consensus of alarmed opinion declares a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in time variously given as 1954 , 1962 , 1968 , 1974 , and now ? with Pres.  | ident Carter 's casting around for a credible portrait of himself as statesman and world leader-1979 . The obsession with security corresponds to the desire of the American rich to live in protected enclaves and to escape the filth and nuisance of the world . Howard Hughes ascends to the roof of a Las Vegas hotel , there to keep himself safe from bacteria ; Hugh Hefner revolves on a round bed in a darkened room , arranging and rearranging pictures of paradise ; David Rockefeller sits drinking milk among reports of poverty and overpopulation : Richard Nixon composes his memoirs in the brooding silence of San Clemente ; and President Carter retires to the little study next to the Oval Office , listening to Wagnerian opera , checking off his list of things to say and do . communing with his God . This inward gaze , and the delight in the chimpanzee 's examination of the American self , contributes to the poor quality of the reporting from abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their presuppositions when they signed up for the package tour . They see what they have been told to see ( otherwise they would n't have been sent ) , and for the most part they notice that the world is a very poor and undeveloped place , not at all like Greenwich , Connecticut , or Far Hills , New Jersey . They assume that happiness can not be separated from its natural setting amidst suburban lawns , and this leads them to suspect that the natives are dissatisfied and therefore angry . What man in his right mind would not want to drive a station wagon and ride in triumph through Grosse Pointe ? The abyss looms on all sides , at all points of latitude and longitude . By confusing his money with his @# " 49  | AMERICA 'S FOREIGN POLICY : A RAKE 'S PROGRESS life , the rich heir imagines himself threatened by enemies of infinite number and variety ? by thieves , dictators , IRS agents , hijackers , unscrupulous women , kings , radicals , kidnappers , and nationalist sentiment in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be bothered with details . He never has time to listen to the whole story or to read through the statistical memoranda and the volumes of supporting analysis . He has planes to catch and meetings to attend , and so he expects his advisers to provide him with summaries and conclusions . Unfortunately , this is a habit of mind that obliges him to conceive of foreign policy in extremely simple categories . A nation is slave or free , North or South , in the First World or the Third . A man who must earn his own fortune learns to make subtle distinctions , and he knows that in all human undertakings , in diplomacy as well as in art or commerce , it is in the details that the issue is decided . So also the man who depends for his livelihood on the animals that he hunts and kills . He studies them with the fondness of a lover , watching them in all weathers , guessing their moods , admiring their grace , following their tracks . The heir to the fortune does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hires gunbearers and assumes that all wars will be short . Because he wants to do everything in a hurry and with the minimum loss to his own troops , he relies on the most brutal and undiscriminating means of warfare . In Vietnam the United States could n't distinguish very clearly between friends and enemies , and so it had no choice but to send the bombers . The soldiers followed the rich man 's simple rule of " shooting everything that moves , " and the Eighty-second Airborne Division resolved the political difficulties by defining a Vietcong as any dead Vietnamese . VII . Family retainers I T IS BOTH customary and correct to say that when President Carter arrived in office he knew very little about diplomatic history , political economy , or geography . Had he been asked , prior to his election and without benefit of public-relations counsel , to give the approximate location of Namibia or Romania , I doubt whether he could have come within several hundred miles of a convincing @# answer . But among American Presidents , a : least during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these matters is the rule rather than the exception . Who can expect a red-blooded American boy to bother himself with a lot of foreign names ? After two years in office , President Ford still had trouble remembering the whereabouts of the Red Arms in relation to Poland . Even President Kennedy , who had traveled in Europe and the South Pacific , remained charmingly vague about Asia and Latin America . Although some schools take more trouble with geography than others , the heirs of the American fortune ordinarily have no occasion to learn much more than the broad outlines of the civilization in which they happen to hspending the money . The better schools also insist that the young men have the good mannerto know the difference between a sonata and a logarithm table , but for the most part an American education ( at Harvard as well aat the universities of Michigan or California constitutes a social rather than an intellectual enterprise . It is also a means of acquiring a cash value , comparable to buying a seat on the stock exchange , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaucracies . If the need arises for more refined intellectual goods and services , the heirs to the estate can always hire a Wall Street law firm or a Jew . Thus do the tribunes of the people fall like sparrows into the nets of the foreign-policy establishment . For the past thirty years , the trustees of this establishment have been reLruired rrom the banking and legal hierarchies in New York and Washington as well as from the prestigious universities deemed to be sufficiently sound in their distrust of the artistic or political imagination . Although innumerable critics and newspaper columnists have remarked on the primacy of this establishment ( cf. , President Carter 's weaning at the dugs of the Trilateral Commission ) , the term itself causes confusion . The establishment does not define itself in terms of specific institutions , publications , or club memberships . Rather it can be understood as organizational support , of both a financial and an intellectual nature , for the belief in the redeeming and transfiguring power of , money . Sums in excess of $100 million have the properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frogs into princes . It is this doctrine , enforced with the rigor of an ecclesiastical court , that binds together counselors of such otherwise disparate views as Dean Rusk , John J. McCloy , Cyrus Vance , William Rogers , Henry Kissinger , Clark ( Continued on page 124 )  | Clifford , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , McGeorge Bundy , and Zbigniew Brzezinski . These men do not constitute a cabal ; it is even probable that they have no wish to form or join an establishment , but because most of the people in the country prefer to avoid the company of foreigners they achieve their eminence by default . Perhaps this explains the shoddiness and the timidity of their policies . It is their submission to the rule of money that gives their advice , no matter what the partisan politics of the moment , its consistency of tone and emphasis . * In periods of relative optimism and extravagance , when the world is young and all things seem possible , the family retainers permit the heir an occasional indulgence or youthful folly . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diem , and allowed him to toy with the hope of assassinating Fidel Castro . But the heir always likes to think well of himself , and so when going about these Machiavellian adventures of state , the family retainers perform the service of doing things in the heir 's name but not in his sight . In this respect they resemble New York divorce lawyers , who for the sake of the children , find it prudent to blackmail the showgirl wife with photographs of her debut in a New Orleans brothel . During periods of reaction and constraint the family retainers warn the heir against doing anything that might injure the integrity of the trust fund . Thus Mr. Carter 's advisers recommend that the United States curry favor with any nation , slave or free , that can guarantee commodities , raw materials , and markets . The more desperate the circumstances of the heir , the more likely that he will be attended by retainers who are themselves consumed with avarice and ambition .

He entered the Nix Administration in the persona of faithful squire and left it in the F sona of the resourceful manservant condescending to sell his court me oirs for $2 million . During the to vised proceedings of the Republic National Convention in Kansas City 1976 the camera paused briefly on M Kissinger sitting in the balcony , 1 telling to the speeches with an expr sion of unconcealed disgust .

Traditionally this as a little gazebo or pavilion with a w of a river or meadow . The heir the fortune could lean against a marble column , staring into the blue - 'tance and thinking thoughts of the eff able . In much the same spirit the United ates erected its policy toward Israel . e Middle East was n't a particularly portant place in 1948 , and the Jews d been through some pretty rough es at Buchenwald and Auschwitz . by not , as Nelson Rockefeller might v , do something nice for the fellas ? hat did it cost anybody ?

Everything went well enough for many years , until , in circumstances much reduced , the geologists found oil in a neighboring pasture . Unhappily , the heir needed the money , and his advisers informed him that he would have to tear down his folly and shift the raise-en-scene of his musings to some other pavilion . The heir objected to this , protesting that he had become fond of looking at the little river . But the lawyers were firm and unrelenting . The Arab money from the desert weighed more heavily in the balance than the Jewish money from the sown . Or , as it was explained to me about a year ago by a director of one of the American oil corporations , Over here at Z , we get down every morning and pray to Mecca ; if necessary we would kiss the ass of every Arab in Riyadh .

" If he gives even $10,000 to a philanthropic charity , he counts upon receiving at least $1 million in services and flattery . President Carter anticipated sustained applause upon the announcement of his opening to China , and when this was not forthcoming he became petulant and sullen . Mr. Warren Christopher , the Deputy Secretary of State , traveled to Taipei only a few days after the United States had declared inoperative its treaty with Taiwan . He proceeded from the airport in a cavalcade of limousines , never for a moment thinking that his progress could be anything out of the ordinary .

How is it possible that all the king 's horses and all the king 's men can not put the Shah of Iran back together again ? The lawyers and managers in their turn blame one another , as well as inflation , unemployment , and the rising cost of labor . Throughout Washington the bureaucracies ooze whispered recriminations . The White House blames the CIA for the poor quality of the intelligence from Teheran , and the CIA blames the White House for not listening to the early reports of discontent , possibly because Mr. Brzezinski could n't hear anyone 125  | speak ill of his strategic hopes for the Persian Gulf or because he did n't want to think Iran could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich man becomes particularly annoyed when he is forced to perceive that he is not behaving decently in the world , that he has associated himself with tyrants and criminals .

Reports or rumors of these unhappy accidents wound the rich man 's self-esteem and cloud the flattering image that he expects to see in the mirrors held up to him by his retainers , his servants , and the press . In the paroxysm of his rage he comes upon the great truth that only the rich and the powerful have rights. * He concludes that other people have failed him , that he has been betrayed by people in whom he placed so much of his trust , and it occurs to him that perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retainers assemble in comfortably furnished conference rooms to prepare exquisite phrases of regret . They ca n't quite say that the Jews deserve what they get because Jews are pushy , or that the English lost the empire because they are selfish , or that the French are corrupt and the Latin Americans shiftless and greedy . This is what they mean , but the words do n't make a good impression in the newspapers . The lawyers talk instead about treaties , trade balances , and the Arabian oil fields as the wellsprings of the democratic alliance . If there is n't time for the polite hypocrisies , or if the nations in question have n't shown a decent respect for the opinions of mankind , then the rich man simply sends the bombers over Hanoi on Christmas Eve . " Envoi I N THE GREAT GAME of diplomacy , I do n't count myself a professional , or even a particularly well-informed amateur . No doubt I do injustice to some of the American statesmen of the 1950s , and I 'm sure that in various aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parody . Those apologies and qualifications having been duly made , I think it fair to say that the people who formulate the present American policies in the world misunderstand the strength of the American idea . The United States remains the most powerful country in the world not because of its wealth or its arsenal but because the Constitution and the Bill of Rights give practical meaning to the possibilities of human aspiration . The society raised up on those foundations allowed men to free themselves from the tyranny of kings and priests . Joined with a democratic form of government , this free-@# @# dom of initiative gave rise to the enormous expansions , in all spheres of human thought and endeavor , that ha'e both created and defined the United ' States . The present generation of would-be statesmen apparently labors under the delusion that the price of liberty , once paid ( preferably by a man 's ancestors ) , can be written off as a non curring debt . Unfortunately the price of liberty must be paid every day . k requires people to renounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead for the gradual process of evolutionary change . This is never easy , but it be . comes all but impossible if people confuse the power of money with the power of the mind and the imagination . The interests of the United States as a nation do not always correspond to its virtues as a democratic republic ; in an increasingly dangerous world , the country sometimes has no choice but to deal with people who could n't qualify for membership in the Century Club . Dealing with such people is a different thing from enthusing about them with the adulation of gossip columnists . No matter how expensive the barbarian gifts and tributes , and no matter how magnificent the silks and furs , the worship of money binds the worshiper to the past as surely as if he had been buried with the gold in Tutankhamen 's tomb . Whenever possible , the United States should ally itself with the evolving future of man 's mind , with those forces in the world ( ideas , nations , movements , political parties , institutions ) that encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country would stand against the forces in the world that require human beings to crawl on the ground like so many humiliated apes . The simplicity of this distinction would oblige the makers of American police to ask of their allies a different set of questions . The health of a nation 's people and the stability of its institutions might come to weigh more heavily in the balance than a Shah 's capacity to give emeralds to the wives of magazine publishers and oil-company presidents . The more people who become fully human in the world , the more they can do for themselves ; the fewer the number of apes , the less seductive the voices prophesying war .
