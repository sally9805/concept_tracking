 | Bike Camping Most people think of bicycles as fun vehicles ? which they are . But bikes can be used for serious traveling , too . Many people are now biking to work . Day-tripping to a nearby park is becoming popular , especially in urban areas . And more and more , you 're seeing people taking their bikes with them when they travel . When you think about it , the combination is unbeatable : You drive to a scenic area , then leave your car and do the sightseeing by bicycle . You get great exercise and a relaxing change of pace . You see a lot more since you travel more slowly and you 're out in the open ? not crammed into a car with limited visibility . And you conserve fuel , since your car sits idle during most of the trip . My wife and I just returned from such a vacation . We traveled from the metropolitan New York area to New Hampshire by automobile , taking our bikes on a car-top carrier . We left the car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through New Hampshire 's spectacular White Mountains ( see map ) . We camped along the way , so we carried quite a bit of : tear ( more about that later ) . We could have stayed in motels or youth hostels and eaten in restaurants . Known as " bike touring , " this mode of travel is preferred by many biking enthusiasts since you travel much lighter and do n't overload the bike . But however you do it , here 's what you should know to make twowheel tripping hassle-free . The best place to carry your bikes is inside the car , where they 're protected from the elements , theft , and accidents . But if yours is a small car ? such as our VW Rabbit ? there is n't room inside . That means you carry your bikes outside , mounted on a carrier . There are carriers that attach to the car 's rear bumper . I do n't like this setup since even a minor fender-bender at a stop light could mean ta-ta to a couple of expensive 10-speeds . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamecraft Corp . ( 30 Hazel Terrace , @#  | Woodbridge , Conn. 06525 ) . A three-point clamping system ( one clamp on the bike 's seat post , two on the handlebars ) holds each bike firmly in place ? reassuring at 55 mph on an interstate . While the carrier itself does n't have an integral lock , it 's a simple matter to loop a cable through the bike 's rear wheels and lock them together . This provides ample security for brief stops along the way . ( For overnight stops I advise parking the bikes next to your bed in the motel room . ) I 'm not going to tell you which bike is the best for you . There 's no such animal . You should ride the bike you feel most comfortable on . But I do strongly recommend a bike equipped with a 10-speed derailleur if you 're carrying camping gear and riding in anything other than totally flat country . The wide range of a 10-speed 's gear ratios takes a lot of the strain out of biking . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make up a 10-speed bike , see " Big Boom in the Hot New Bikes " in the July ' 71 issue of PS or the books listed at the end of this article . Camping gear Like backpacking , bike packing demands equipment that minimizes weight . But with the wide range of lightweight camping gear available , choosing an outfit that comes in at under 30 pounds is no problem . Even with our photographic equipment , we kept our loads to under 30 pounds apiece . We carried Eddie Bauer sleeping bags ( Box 3700 , Seattle , Wash . 98124 ) to keep us warm on the chilly autumn New England nights . Three-quarter-length foam pads under the bags kept us dry , and provided additional insulation . The bag and pad combined weighed under five pounds . A tent of lightweight nylon ( Eclipse 's Tour-Lite , weighing in at five pounds ) , butane stove , lightweight cooking gear , first-aid kit , and a day 's supply of freeze-dried food completed the basic outfit . We carried the freeze-dried food for emergency use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . A bike repair kit is a necessity . Take a tube-repair kit , two tire irons , spare tube , small adjustable wrench , screwdriver , spare derailleur cable , brake cable , brake blocks ( two ) , and some extra spokes . If your bike does n't have a framemounted air pump , buy one . For more information on gear you 'll need , see " Bicycle Camping ? What You Need to Know to Join the Fun , " PS , Apr. ' 72 . Carrying the load Unlike backpacking , when you camp by bike you do n't carry your gear on your back . Instead , let the bike do the carrying . For this you 'll need a bike-pack system . We equipped one bike with bags by Eclipse ( P.O. Box 372 , Ann Arbor , Mich. 48107 ) , the other with bags by Cannondale ( 35 Pulaski St. , Stamford , Conn. 06902 ) . ( For details , see " Put Your Wheels to Work : Bike Accessories for Camping or Shopping , " PS , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each system consisted of two rear pannier bags , which hang from the bike carrier , outboard of the rear wheel , a seat pack , and a handlebar bag . We found that this setup gave us plenty of room to carry our gear protected from the elements , except for the sleeping bags and foam pads , which we strapped to the top of the rear carriers with bungee cords . We divided the weight between @# the two bikes , and then careful distributed it on each . A bike loaded this way takes a bit of getti : used to , however . You just do ; jump on and ride off . But wi some care and practice at firyou 'll find that you readily adapt . The rider 's curse Saddle sores are the bane of an one who rides anything . Bikes a no different . You prevent this 1 wearing riding shorts . They 're mid thigh length , have an elastic waiand cost about $15 at bike shop Their most important feature is chamois insert in the crotch . This what keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . Do use toe clips ? metal and leather straps you slip your foot into so it stays on the pedal and you can pull on the upstrokes . You may want to wear bicycle shot -- which have steel stiffeners and pc forated uppers and soles . We won ? tennis shoes and were quite hap with them for the four-day trip . 1 temperatures had been warmer an the trip longer , I 'd opt for the ccle shoes . On our trip we found that the . best time to travel was in the earl morning , before traffic built up . R planned the trip so that there wen about 25 to 30 miles between cams grounds . This allowed for a leisure ly pace and time to sightsee . W. frequently were at our destinatio : by early afternoon , leaving the re mainder of the day to relax , set u ; camp , hike , or jump into one cf New Hampshire 's ice-cold mountain rivers . You could stretch a day 's traveling by bike to 50 or 60 miles day , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance be tht guideline . And remember the whole idea behind bike camping : Go slow and enjoy the scenery . @#
