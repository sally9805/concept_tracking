The Sky Is Falling on Washigton <P> So it may seem to Jimmy Carter as he plunges further in polls <P> Not until late this month , at the earliest , is the falling Skylab expected to shower the earth with red-hot debris . From the White House last week , it may have looked as if Skylab were arriving early . President Carter 's public standing in the polls was still dropping , to an all-time low for him of 37% in the latest nationwide Gallup survey and to an almost unbelievable 11% in Mervin Field 's California Poll . The gasoline lines that seemed to be lessening in California began appearing in New York . A new round of Middle East oil price increases heralded still worse days ahead , both in the gas lines and for the nation as a whole ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . <P> Apparently without any new ideas for confronting the nation 's economic troubles , Carter did his best to sound confident . At a press conference , his 50th since taking office , Carter declared that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration legislation blocked in Congress . He added that he is undismayed by the stampede among Democrats to draft Ted Kennedy as their candidate for President in 1980 : " No President can expect to have unanimous support . " His " difficult " decisions on energy , inflation and foreign policy , Carter said , have cost him votes , " and if I should ever modify my positions away from what 's best for the country in order to pick up support , then I would not deserve to be President . " <P> Far from accepting any blame for the drift in Washington , Carter called on the public to complain to Congress . " The American people are beginning to feel that their own Government ca n't deal adequately with crucial issues , like inflation and like energy , " said Carter , just as though he had little part in that Government . Until the public gets aroused , he added , " we 're going to have difficulty in Washington getting action taken . " <P> Two days later , Carter tried to patch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives in the Cabinet room for a session that a White House aide said would plot " how we can best manage the projected gasoline shortfall this summer . " The President also wanted to know why prices were rising so fast . For two hours , the oilmen gave him their version of the crisis . The gasoline retailers blamed the oil producers for zooming prices at the pumps . Sniped Victor Rasheed , president of the Virginia Retail Dealers Association : " There has been some price gouging , perhaps , by the oil companies . " The oil producers , in turn , blamed the problem on a shortage of crude , chiefly caused by cutbacks in pumping by the OPEC nations . Gulf Oil Corp . Chairman Jerry McAfee urged " that we avoid finger pointing and name calling that does nobody any good . "
