txt GOV . WALKER brusquely turned down the appointment of Marshall Salo-way as a member of the Chicago Transit Authority board Friday , apparently because Subway supported building the Crosstown Expressway rather than using the , money for public transportation . Sideway , the city 's public works commissioner , had been nominated last January for the post by Mayor Daley and apparently was destined to become CTA chairman . The appointment required the approval of the governor . Walker made his rejection in the form of a letter to Daley , stating that Safeway " Indicates a lack of sensitivity to public transpoytation issues . " CITING A letter he had received from Suloway , written June 19 after Walker requested his views on the Crosstown Expressway , the governor told Daley : " Nowhere does Mr. Subway describe the need for improved public transportation facilities in the Chicago area or even acknowledge that funds now allocated to the Crosstown could be used for the improvement of public transportation thruout the Chicago area . " As member and possibly chairman of the CTA , Walker told Daley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public transportation , and his unwillingness to do so certainly reflects adversely on his qualifications for this Important post . " THEREFoitE , I will not approve the appointment of Mr. Subway as a member of the Chicago Transit Authority Board . " Mayor Daley could not be reached for comment on Walker 's rejection of Subway . The mayor reportedly was on his way to Boston . Reached by reporters after Walker announced the rejection , Subway said he was n't expecting it . Asked if it came as a shock , he answered : " When you are my age , nothing comes as a shock . " He said he was still the public works commissioner " and very happy with the job I have . " He said he would have no further comment until he saw Walker 's letter . IN THE LETTER to Daley , Walker showed anger at what he termed Suloway 's " arrogant " attitude toward the governor as expressed in the letter he wrote Walker . Subway had told the governor that he was " shocked and amazed " over Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any obstruction which w- ould prevent the building of the Crosstown corridor , " Subway wrote Walker , " would result in massive harm-to the transportation system serving Chicago and the suburbs . " IT IS essential to remember that the plan for , building the Crosstown is the result of the vote of Congress . It was the Congress which appropriated the funds and earmarked them for construction of the Crosstown to serve the people of Illinois . Moreover , it Is the Congress that mandated Crosstown be constructed if the city so desired . " Walker told Daley : " I certainly would not tolerate any of my appointees to the board to address you in such an irresponsible and , indeed , arrogant manner . " Construction of the crosstown was the first big issue on which Walker and Daley took sides . Walker campaigned on the promise of killing the expressway when he ran for governor in 1972 . Several community groups objected to the project because they said it would displace entire neighborhoods.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
