Little chips learn to speak <P> <P> " You are exceeding the 55 m.p.h. speed limit , " intones the engine . " Time to fill ' er up , " announces the gas tank . It sounds like something out of Looney Tunes , but a talking Ford may well be in the future , not to mention babbling Buicks and loquacious Lincolns . Ford and General Motors are tinkering with computerized voice synthesizers that in several years could replace the dashboard gauges with oral announcements about the condition of the car . Officials of both companies stress that audible autos are still a long way off , but , says a GM spokesman , " We might have something to show you in a couple of years . " <P> The technology for talking cars comes off the Dallas drawing boards of Texas Instruments Inc. , which has come up with a computer chip , costing less than $5 to manufacture , that synthesizes the human voice . So far , TI has used the chip only in its $60 talking learning aid for children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with considerable success since last September . The red and yellow plastic device asks wide-eyed kids and fascinated adults to spell words as easy as was or as difficult as quotient by punching out the letters on a keyboard . It then responds , " That is correct , " or " That is incorrect , " and gives the bad speller two more chances before it spells the word itself and goes on to the next word . The chip has a vocabulary of 250 words , and another chip called Vowel Power can add 150 more . The voice is a male monotone patterned after the Midwestern accent of a Dallas radio announcer . Says a TI public relations man : " We were looking for standard American speech-not good English , just very American . " <P> Speech patterns , like other sound waves , can be charted by assigning a numerical value to each point on the wave . These numbers are then run through a computer in sequence , and the numerical input is converted into sound by electrical impulses . The tremendous increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate such variables as pitch and loudness into numerical values to reproduce a sound exactly . <P> Three years ago , Telesensory Systems Inc. of Palo Alto , Calif. , came out with its Speech Plus talking calculator , which sounds out the numbers and the functions that are punched in . Price : $395 . Next year Telesensory hopes to produce a computer for the blind that will scan a printed page and turn it into speech . <P> TI is so secretive about the way Speak &; Spell works that competitors are buying the toy just to smash it and recover the chip . The Texas company has managed to put a fairly large vocabulary onto a computer chip at low cost . With that , synthetic speech becomes possible in many consumer products . Washing machines could gurgle when the suds get too high , and the refrigerator could snarl at the midnight raider . But what , the best brains in Detroit are wondering , will happen when a driver 's eight-track quadraphonic recording of Disco Queen Donna Summer is interrupted by a disembodied voice warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheating ?
