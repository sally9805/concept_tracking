California 's Governor Brown thinks he has some better ideas <P> If he runs for the presidency in 1980 , as many expect , California Governor Jerry Brown will be ready with his own energy program . Among other things , the $500 million Brown plan for California , unveiled after New Year 's , proposes using windmills , wood chips , walnut shells , rice hulls , solar panels , coal gasification and hot water as alternatives to fossil fuels . Says Brown : " Americans seem to be getting less inventive . I 'm going to try to stimulate things the best I can through energy innovation . " <P> Of the total package , Brown would budget $200 million for energy development , $50 million of which would be used for a proposed Southern California Edison Co. plant that turns coal into gas , and $50 million more for the private development of the geothermal industry , which uses hot-water springs to create steam . Among Brown 's more unusual ideas for spending the remaining $100 million : $4 million for the installation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; up to $3 million for the use of agricultural wastes-wood chips , walnut shells and maybe rice hulls-to heat and cool the state capitol and other government buildings . The wastes are baked until they emit organic gas , which is then collected and burned as fuel . <P> Another $200 million would go to conservation . One plan calls for modifying state buildings to cut down energy use by 25% : Brown wants more efficient lighting levels and heating-system maintenance . The remaining $100 million would be used to " grow fuel , " as one state official put it , in a reforestation project . <P> Environmentalists applaud Brown 's plan for its " symbolic effect . " Political foes find little to cheer about . Said former Los Angeles Police Chief Edward Davis , who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination : " When I was a small boy , I liked to play with toys too . But using windmills is like harnessing fleas when you have an elephant like nuclear energy available . " Retorted Brown : " When Fulton invented the steamboat , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't laughing . They know that walnut shells actually work . " <P> Not content with just an energy program , the Governor also plans his own space program for California , complete with a communications satellite , a space-faring academy with courses in space law and trade and a space research institute within the University of California . Brown detractors are chuckling . Wisecracks one : " Jerry has always been a little spaced-out , but this is carrying things too far . "
