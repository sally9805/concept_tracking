" I eat lunch in the White House mess in 25 minutes , " lamented a White House aide last week . " Everybody is afraid to talk . So the only thing you can do is bury your head in your soup . " <P> " I heard Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz was thinking of resigning , and when I heard that , I got right on the phone to tell him not to do it , " said Iowa Congressman Bill Scherle , standing outside the House chamber during a debate on the farm bill . " He 's our friend . If we lose him we lose a lot . " <P> " I heard some of the stories about George Secretary of the Treasury Shultz leaving , so I called up Sunday night , and it was only 8 o'clock and he already was in bed exhausted , " a friend said . " He 'd been working all day at the office . I 'm concerned . " <P> " Everything has stopped , " declared a frustrated Washington attorney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury . We ca n't get any decisions . And at the Price Commission it is hopeless . We 've got a raft of exceptions we 're trying to get settled from Phase II . " <P> " We 've been trying to get the St. Louis airport straightened out for months , " mused a senatorial assistant . " They need more facilities there . The question is whether they should expand Lambert Field or whether they should build another airport over in East St. Louis in Illinois . First John Ehrlichman had it , and he said he would make a decision . You know what happened to him . They told us the decision was in the hands of Egil Krogh , the new Under Secretary of Transportation . You know what happened to him too . Now there is a new man , I ca n't even remember his name . " <P> " We do n't know where to go for direction , " sighed a White House staff assistant . " We 've got the President 's daughter being contradicted by the press office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Buzhardt , issues a memorandum , which is immediately disavowed by the press secretary . " <P> " I ran into a friend of Melvin Laird 's the new White House domestic czar out West , and he felt Laird would be cut in a couple of months , " said a Washington lawyer . <P> These are the voices of Washington now . Some others : <P> " It is more serious than I ever remember it . . . It is n't just people sitting in front of their TV sets and watching the Watergate hearings . It is deeper than that now . There is a tremendous uncertainty . . . My friends want to leave not because of Nixon so much , but because nothing has happened . . . I can see now that I 'm not going to be able to accomplish much . Would I be disloyal if I left at the end of the year ? . . . I keep hearing how hard it is to get the President 's attention . " <P> Mel Laird , Bryce Harlow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief of staff , are fighting this crushing weight of discouragement . So is Nixon in a way , but he remains a distracted-and now ill-man . ( " How do we get him out of that cocoon ? " worried one White House official last week . ) <P>
