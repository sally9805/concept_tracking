Some of it I know from Leonard Douglas . Some of it I know from having once seen Warren Bogart and some of it I know from having once seen Marin but most of what I know , the most reliable part of what I know , derives from my training in iuman behavior . I do not mean my training under Kroeber at Califortia , nor with Levi-Strauss at Sgo Paulo . I mean my training in being de quern , an outsider . I am de afuera . I have been de afuera all my life . It is a little more than a year now since Charlotte Douglas 's death and almost two years since her arrival in Boca Grande . Charlotte Douglas 's death . Charlotte Douglas 's murder . Neither word works . Charlotte Douglas 's previous engagement . ILE MORNING THE FBI MEN first came to the house on California Street Charlotte did not understand why . She had read newspaper accounts of the events they recited , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no connection between the pitiless revolutionist they described and Marin , who at seven had stood on a chair to make her own breakfast and wept helplessly when asked to clean her closet . Sweet Marin . Who at sixteen had been photographed with her two best friends wearing the pink-and-white candy-striped pinafores of Children 's Hospital volunteers , and had later abandoned her Saturdays at the hospital as " too sad .

This section has been adapted from ter most recent novel , A Book of Common Prayer , which will be published early next year by Simon and Schuster . Who at eighteen had been observed with her four best friends detonating a crude pipe bomb in the lobby of the Transamerica Building at 6:30 A.M. , hijacking a P.S.A . L-1011 at San Francisco Airport and landing it at Wendover , Utah , where they burned it in time for the story to interrupt the network news and disappeared . Marin . Or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marin , who was at that moment , even as the two FBI men occupied Leonard 's Barcelona chairs , even as the fat FBI man toyed with one of Leonard 's porcelain roses and even as the thin FBI man gazed over Charlotte 's head at the ten-by-sixteen-foot silk screen of Mao Tse-tung given to Leonard by one of the Alameda Three , skiing at Squaw Valley . Or so Charlotte tried to tell the fat FBI man . The thin one did not seem to be listening . I am talking here about a day in November one year before the day in November when Charlotte Douglas first appeared in Boca Grande . Three or four things I know about Charlotte . As a child of comfortable family in the temperate zone she had been as a matter of course provided with clean sheets , orthodontia , lamb chops , living grandparents , attentive godparents , one brother named Dickie , ballet lessons , and casual timely information about menstruation and the care of flat silver . as well as with a small wooden angel , carved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her prayers . In these prayers the child Charlotte routinely asked that " it " turn out all right , " it " being unspecified and all-inclusive , and she had been an adult for some years before the possibility occurred to her that " it " might not . She had put this doubt from her mind . As a child of the western United States she had been provided as well with faith in the value of certain frontiers on which her family had lived , in the virtues of cleared and irrigated land , of high-yield crops , of thrift , industry and the judicial system , of progress and education , and in the generally upward spiral of history . She was a norteamericana . She was immaculate of history , innocent of politics . There were startling vacuums in her store of common knowledge . During the two  --  years she spent at Berkeley before she ran away to New York with an untenured instructor named Warren Bogart , she had read mainly the Brontes and Vogue , bought a loom , gone home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week . In those two years she had entered the main library once , during a traveling exhibition of the glass flowers from Harvard . She recalled having liked the glass flowers . From books Warren Bogart gave her to read when she was twenty Charlotte learned for the first time about the Spanish Civil War , memorized the ideological distinctions among the various PSUC brigades and POUM militia , but until she was twenty-two and Warren Bogart divined and corrected her misapprehension she believed that World War II had begun at Pearl Harbor . From Leonard Douglas she had absorbed a passing fluency in Third World power , had learned what the initials meant in Algeria and Indochina and the Caribbean , buton a blank map of the world she could not actually place the countries where the initials were in conflict . She considered the conflict dubious in any case . She understood that something was always going on in the world but believed that it would turn out all right . She believed the world to be peopled with others like herself . She associated the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few events in the history of the United States prior to the westward expansion to have come to her attention . She also associated it with events in France and Russia that had probably turned out all right , otherwise why had they happened . A not atypical norteamericana . Of her time and place . Some things about Charlotte I never understood . She was a woman who grew faint when she noticed the blue arterial veins in her wrists , could not swim in clouded water , and once suffered an attack of acute terror while wading in water where an artesian well churned up the sand . Yet during the time she was in Boca Grande once saw her skin an iguana for stew . I once saw her make the necessary incision in the trachea of an OAS field worker who was choking on a piece of steak at the Jockey Club . A doctor had been called but the OAS man was turning blue . Charlotte did it with a boning knife plunged first into a vat of boiling rice . A few nights later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the Caribe terrace , but that , although suggestive of the ambiguous signals Charlotte tended to transmit , is neither here nor there . Similarly , during the cholera outbreak that year Charlotte volunteered to give inoculations , and she did , for thirty-four hours without sleeping , until the remaining Lederle vaccine was appropriated by one of the colonels . When the colonel suggested that as a nortearrierienno she might be in a position to buy back some of the vaccine Charlotte only smiled , took off the white smock she had borrowed from the clinic , and dropped it at the colonel 's feet . For the rest of that day Charlotte sat on the edge of the Caribe pool with her feet in the water and stared at the birds circling in the white sky . She did not wear dark glasses and by five o'clock the pale skin around her eyes was burned and puffy . For a few days Charlotte spoke about leaving Boca Grande , but within a week she had revised the incident to coincide with her own view of human behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the army could lend its resources to the inoculation program . I used to think that the only event in Charlotte Douglas 's life to resist her revisions and erasures was Marin 's disappearance . NTERESTINC PORTRAIT THERE , " the thin FIN man said , his eyes still on the ten-by-sixteen-foot silk screen given to Leonard by one of the Alameda Three . " Warhol . " Charlotte said . " I would have guessed Mao . " " Mao . Of course . " Charlotte had no idea how one of the Alameda Three had happened to come by a Warhol silk screen . Or maybe it had not been one of the Alameda Three at all , maybe it had been one of the Tacoma Eleven or some Indian or Panther or heir to a motion-picture studio , Charlotte could never keep Leonard 's clients straight . They came in packs and they ate and they asked for odd drinks and they went through her medicine cabinet and they borrowed and did net return her sweaters and they never addressed her directly and she could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She also wished that Marin would walk through the door of the house on California Street with a tow ticket tied to her s windbreaker . " You see you do n't know Marin , " she added finally . " I know her . " The fat FBI man coughed . The other examined a matchbook he had picked up from a table . " I mean I 'm her mother . " " Of course you are , " the fat FBI man said . " I do n't quite follow what she 's saying about this Chinese couple , " one of the new FBI men said . It was almost time for lunch and Charlotte had not yet eaten breakfast and the house on California Street seemed to be filling with men who spoke to each other as if Charlotte were not there . " What Chinese couple ? " " The Chinese couple who come to the house , " Charlotte repeated . " And do the Peking duck . " " I do n't quite follow what she 's talking about , " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point . " " Maybe if she could run through it again . Marin arrives from Berkeley . Start there . Day before yesterday . Approximately twenty hours prior to the bombing . Marin arrives from Berkeley to --  " " To borrow a windbreaker . " Charlotte spoke by rote . " To go skiing . " " To borrow a windbreaker . But she does n't leave right away . She goes up to her room and she 's up there alone maybe three , four hours , ball-park figure , you are n't sure which . Up in her room she ? " " You wanted her to tell it . Eddie , let her tell it . " Charlotte raised her voice . " She went through some things in her drawers . " " What things . " " I do n't know what things . She 's eighteen years old , I do n't go through her drawers . " " Mrs. Douglas mentioned a gold bracelet , Eddie , do n't forget the gold bracelet . " " You mentioned a gold bracelet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold bracelet she thought she 'd lost . " " In a drawer . " " in a drawer , behind a drawer . " There was something about the gold bracelet Charlotte wanted not to think about . Marin had dropped the bracelet on the kitchen table and told Charlotte to keep it . Marin had called the bracelet " dead metal . " Charlotte wished suddenly that she had not mentioned the bracelet and she also wished suddenly that Leonard were not in Nicosia . Or Damascus . Or wherever he was . He had written out the cities and the hotels and the telephone numbers on a legal pad upstairs but Charlotte had not looked at it since he left . Her left temple was beginning to hurt and she resented the FBI men for remembering the gold bracelet . " Now we get to the part where I call the Chinese couple and ask them to do the Peking duck . " She could hear the edge in her voice but could not control it . " All right ? " " We 're back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man the others called Eddie said . " Not exactly , " Charlotte said . " They come to your house ? They cook dinner ? " Charlotte nodded . " Then they 're caterers . Was n't that kind of an exceptional thing to do , Mrs. Douglas , telephoning these ca. terers ? " " I do n't quite see the exceptional part . " Charlotte wished that the FBI man would not insist on calling the Chinese couple " caterers . " They were not caterers , they were a couple . Under certain circumstances which had not yet arisen they might come to the house on California Street not as cooks but as guests . Charlotte knew a lot of couples like the Chinese couple who did the Peking duck . She knew the Algerian couple who did the couscous , she knew the Indonesian couple who did the rijstafel , she knew the Mexican couple who were actually second-generation Chicano but who did the authentic Mexican dinner , not common enchiladas and refried beans but exquisite recipes they had learned while vacationing at the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew the Korean couple . She had recently uncovered the Vietnamese couple . In the kitchen of the house on California Street these and other couples regularly reproduced the menus of underdeveloped countries around the world , but usually for twelve or twenty-four people . Charlotte had never before called one of these couples to cook for fewer than twelve . This time she had . That might be the exceptional part . She began to see calling the Chinese couple to do Peking duck for herself and Marin in a different light , a light not necessarily more revealing but different . In this light the gold bracelet she had made Marin take had been too loose on Marin 's wrist . In this light Marin had been too thin and pale for a child who skied and played tennis and was supposed to have spent the week before celebrating Thanksgiving off Cabo San Lucas . In this light Charlotte had lit the fire and turned on the record player and called the Chinese couple for the same reason she had insisted that Marin take the bracelet : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catered dinner for two must be quite an expensive proposition , " the FBI man said . " They 're quite reasonable . " Charlotte spoke automatically . " Considering . " " Catered dinner for one , " the FBI man said . " Technically . Since Marin did n't stay . " " Marin had a paper to finish before she went skiing , I told you . " Charlotte avoided the blank gaze of the FBI men . " She had a paper to finish for her seminar in I think Moby Dick . " The fat FBI man spoke for the first time since the arrival of the others . " She 's not registered as a student , Mrs. Douglas , I suppose you know that " " Actually you should try this couple . " Charlotte spoke very clearly to shut out his voice . She did not know why she had said it was a seminar in Moby Dick . Marin had never mentioned any seminar in Moby Dick . " She has n't been registered for two quarters , and the quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you know this . " " I mean if you like Cantonese food at all . " Moby Dick had something to do with Warren . At nineteen Charlotte bad written a paper on Melville and Warren had failed her . Warren had failed her and had rung her doorbell for the first time at midnight with the paper torn in half and a bag of cherries and a bottle of bourbon and they had not left the apartment for forty-eight hours . For the first three she called him Mr. Bogart and for the next forty-five she called him nothing at all and it was not until the third day , when he took her to his apartment and asked her to clean it up and she came across the letter from the department chairman advising him that his contract would not be renewed , that she ever called him Warren . Still not looking at the FBI man Charlotte stood up and began placing their coffee cups on a tray . " They also do a marvelous Szechuan beef thing . " The fat FBI man signalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught a seminar in Moby Dick once , " Charlotte said before she broke . After the FBI men left that morning Charlotte went upstairs to Marin 's room , The Raggedy Ann Warren had sent for Marin 's twelfth birthday was on its shelf . The teddy bear Warren had sent for Marin 's fourteenth Easter was on its chair . The guitar once used by Joan Baez was on the window seat , where it had been since the night Leonard bought it for Marin at an ACLU auction . The embroidered Swiss organdy curtains were as pristine as they had been the day Marin picked them out . The old valentines beneath the glass on the dressing table were unchanged , the tray of silver bangles and bath oil and eye shadow untouched . All that Marin had removed from the room was every picture , every snapshot , every clipping or class photograph which contained her own image . NE IMAGINES A SWEET indolent girl , soft with baby fat , her attention span low and her range of interest limited . Marin approved of infants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " showing off . " She ap-peared to approve equally of Leonard and Warren , and tailored her per-formance to please each of them . When Warren came to San Francisco she would appear instinctively in the navy-blue blazer no longer required by the progressive Episcopal day school she attended . For Leonard and his friends she would wear blue jeans , and a dashiki which scratched her skin . On principle she " adored madly- the presents Warren occasionally sent , although by her fifteenth birthday these presents still ran to the sporadic stuffed animal in a box bearing the chargeplate stamp of whatever woman he was living with at the time . In principle she was tolerant of Leonard 's efforts on behalf of social justice , although in practice she often found the beneficiaries of these efforts " weird " and their predicaments " unnecessary . " That Episcopal day school Marin attended from the age of four until she entered Berkeley had as its aim " the development of a realistic but optimistic attitude , " and it was characteristic of Charlotte that whenever the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she read it as " realistic and optimistic . " That was Charlotte . Not Marin . Marin would never bother changing a phrase to suit herself because she perceived the meanings of words only dimly , and without interest . Perhaps because of her realistic but optimistic attitude Marin was easily confused by such moral questions as were raised by the sight of someone disfigured ( would a good God make ugly people ? ) or the problem of dividing her Halloween candy with the Episcopal orphans ( do six licorice balls for the orphans equal one Almond Hershey for Marin , if Marin dislikes licorice ? 1 . and when conftised could turn sulky , and withdrawn . What else do I know about Marin . I know that her posture toward all adult women was agreeably patronizing . I know that her posture toward all adult men , toward Leonard and toward Warren and toward any man at all who was not disfigured , was uncomplicatedly seductive . Her mind was empty of grudges and hurts and family malice . Her energies were simple and physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale verdigris from the chlorine in swimming pools . Charlotte adored her , brushed her pale hair and licked the tears from her cheeks , held her hand crossing streets and wanted never to let go , believed that when she walked through the valley of the shadow she would be sustained by the taste of Marin 's salt tears , her body and blood . The night Charlotte was interrogated and shot in the Estadio Nacional she cried not for God but for Marin . SEE , " LEONARD KEPT SAYING from wherever he was on the day the FBI first came to the house on California Street , " I see . " " I do n't see , " Charlotte said . " Frankly I do n't see at all . " There was a silence . " You 're calling from the house . " " What difference does it make . " Charlotte could hear only the faint crackle on the cable . Actually she had forgotten that she was never supposed to call Leonard from the house if she had anything important to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the call on what Leonard called a neutral line . During the Mendoza trial in Cleveland she had called Leonard every day from a pay phone in Magnin 's and once she had taken a room in a motel on Van Ness just to call London and tell Leonard that she missed him , but now that she had to tell him that Marin was said to have bombed the Transamerica Building she was calling from the white Princess phone in Marin 's room . " I mean what difference could it possibly make if they 're listening , since I 'm only telling you what they told me in the first place . " Still Leonard said nothing . " I mean , " Charlotte said , ca n't leave the house . " " I want you to leave the house . I want you to stay with Polly Orben in Sausalito . I want you to call Polly Orben right away --  " " I do n't want to stay with Polly Orben . " Polly ( ) then had been Leonard 's analyst for eight years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking about for eight years but Polly Orhen frequently reported that they were within a year or so of " terminating , " or " ending . " She seemed to mean finishing the analysis . " I do n't want to leave the house . " " It 's Wednesday . Polly counsels at Glide on Wednesday , call her at Glide ? " " I have to be here when Marin calls . " " My point is this . " Leonard spoke very carefully . " You do n't know where Marin is . " " That 's exactly why I have to be here . " " And if you do n't know where Marin is , then you ca n't tell anyone where Marin is . Under oath . Can you . " Charlotte said nothing . " If you see my point . " Still Charlotte said nothing . " Get in touch with Warren . Tell him exactly what I just told you . Tell him he does n't want to hear from her . " " I guess I 'll just wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then hire you . " Charlotte did not call Polly Orben at Glide . Charlotte did not get in touch with Warren . For the rest of that day Charlotte only lay on Marin 's bed , staring at the black-button eyes of the Raggedy Ann Warren had sent for Marin 's twelfth birthday . Charlotte did not see how Marin could have played any useful role in flying an L-1011 to Wendover , Utah . Marin could not even drive a car with a manual transmission . Marin could not fly an L-1011 so Marin must be skiing at Squaw Valley . Marin had called her great-grandmother 's wedding bracelet dead metal . Marin had been in bed with the flu on her twelfth birthday and as if she were four instead of twelve had slept all night with Warren 's Raggedy Ann in her arms . When it began to rain at six o'clock Charlotte wrapped herself in Marin 's blanket but did not close the windows . She went downstairs only once , when two of the FBI men came back to ask if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " In a drawer upstairs she had three recent photographs that Marin had overlooked but there was some quite definite reason why she did not want the FBI men to have them . She could not put her finger on the reason but she knew that there was one . " I 'd have to look . " She made no move to look . She realized suddenly that she was still holding the Raggedy Ann , with its dress pulled up to show the red heart that said I LOVE YOU . One of the FBI men cleared his throat . " I do n't suppose you 've heard from her , " he said finally . " I 'm sure you 'd tell us if you had , " the other said . " Actually I would n't , " she said finally . " Mrs. Douglas ? " " Actually I 'd lie . I 'd lie to you and I 'd perjure myself in court . You know that . You heard me tell my husband that on the telephone . " The two FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't hear me someone in your office certainly did , you should compare notes down there . " She did not want to talk to the FBI this way but she could hear her own voice and it sounded bright and social and it did not stop . " Someone down there 's been listening to me on the phone for at least five years , you should know me by now . I 'd lie . " " I 'm sure you know that under the law a parent has no special ? " The other FBI man held up his hand as if to silence his partner . " Maybe you 'd like someone to stay with you tonight , Mrs. Douglas . Keep an eye on things . " " I have someone keeping an eye on things . I have all those people you moved into the apartment across the street . Have n't I. I mean I did n't see you move them in , but I know how you operate . " She could not seem to stop herself . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raggedy Ann . " One thing I do n't know . I do n't know if you kept tapes of all those telephone calls . " Neither man spoke . mean it could he very useful if you did . If you could sit down now and listen to those telephone calls you 'd probably know more about Marin and me and Leonard and Warren then I even remember . You could probably figure the whole thing out . " One of the men closed his briefcase . The other reached for his raincoat . " You must have six or seven hundred hours on Marin and Lisa Harper alone . Doing their algebra . " Charlotte smoothed the Raggedy Ann 's dress over its red heart and did not look at the FBI men . " Lisa 's at Stanford this year . In case you missed the installment when Lisa got into Stanford and Marin did n't . " " We 're not on opposing sides , Mrs. Douglas . " " Marin cried when the letter came from Stanford . You probably remember that . Marin crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed the rain was streaming down Marin 's organdy curtains and puddling on the parquet floor . Charlotte knew as she woke why she could not give the FBI a recent photograph of Marin . She could not give the FBI a recent photograph of Marin because any photograph useful to them would show Marin 's eves , and then Marin 's eyes would stare back at her from newspapers and television screens , and she was not yet ready to deliver her child to history . I 0 Leonard flew home immediately but because of an airport strike at Beirut and a demonstration at Orly it took him thirty-six hours to arrive in San Francisco , and by then they had sifted the debris and identified Marin 's gold bracelet attached like a charm to the firing pin of the bomb . They had also received the tape , and released Marin 's name to the press . Charlotte learned about the tape when she opened the door of the house on California Street and found a television crew already filming . On the six o'clock news there was film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera and running upstairs as a young Negro pursued her with a microphone . When this film was repeated at eleven it was followed for the first time by the picture of Marin , the famous picture of Marin Bogart , the two  --  yearold newspaper picture of Marin in her pink-and-white candy-striped Children 's Hospital volunteer 's pinafore . The newspaper had apparently lost the negative and simply cropped and enlarged a newsprint reproduction in which Marin was almost indistinguishable , clearly a complaisant young girl in a pinafore but enigmatically expressionless , her eyes only smudges on the gravure screen . In the weeks that followed the appearance of the picture those two photogravure smudges would eradicate every other image Charlotte had of Marin 's eyes . The day I finally saw Marin I was surprised by her eyes . She has Charlotte 's eyes . She has nothing else of Charlotte 's but she has Charlotte 's eyes . OlU NO DOUBT HEARD THE TAPE . " This is not an isolated action . We ask no one 's permission to make the revolution . " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I read excerpts from it in Time and in Prensa Latina and in the Caracas Daily Journal , excerpts always illustrated by the impenetrable picture of the child in the candy-striped pinafore . The night Charlotte first heard the tape she tried to transcribe it word for word , so that she could explain to Leonard and Warren what Marin had in mind . She got only as far as the part where Marin discussed what she called the revolutionary character of her organization . " Now I would like to discuss the revolutionary character of our organization , " Marin definitely said on the tape . " The fact that our organization is revolutionary in character is due above all to the fact that all our activity is defined as revolutionary . " Charlotte read this sentence several times . She wondered if she had misheard Marin , or missed an important clause . The tape was still running and Marin could still be heard , talking about " expropriation " and " firepower " and " revolutionary justice " and about how the Transamerica Building was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Charlotte was still fixed on that one sentence . The fact that our organization is revolutionary in character is due above all to the fact that all our activity is defined as revolutionary . She could parse the sentence but she could make no sense of it , could find no way to rephrase it so that Leonard and Warren would understand . As it turned out she did not need to explain the sentence to Leonard because when he arrived from the airport at midnight he said that the sentence was not original with Marin but had been lifted from a handbook by a Brazilian guerrilla theorist named Marighela . " I 've got just one thing to say about the operation , " Leonard said . Charlotte waited . " I know where they got their rhetoric but I 'd like to know where they got their hardware . " As it turned out Charlotte did not need to explain the sentence to Warren either because when he called from New York at two that morning he had already heard the tape and . like Leonard , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fuck Marin , " he said . HEN I MARRIED Edgar Strasser-Mendana I received , from an aunt in Denver who had been taken as a bride to a United Fruit station in Cuba , twenty-four Haviland dessert plates in the Windsor Rose pattern and a letter of instructions for living in the tropics . I was to allow no night soil on my kitchen garden , boil water for douches as well as for drinking , preserve my husband 's books with a thin creosote solution , schedule regular hours for sketching or writing and regard the playing of bridge as an avoidance of reality to be indulged only at biweekly intervals and never with depressive acquaintances . In this regime I could perhaps escape what the letter called the fever and disquiet of the latitudes . That I had been living in these same latitudes unmarried for some years made no difference to my aunt : she appeared to locate the marriage bed as the true tropic of fever and disquiet . So in many ways did Charlotte . I think I have never known anyone who regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So dark and febrile and outside the range of the normal did all aspects of this contract seem to Charlotte that she was for example incapable of walking normally across a room in the presence of two men with whom she had slept . Her legs seemed to lock unnaturally into her pelvic bones . Her body went stiff , as if convulsed by the question of who had access to it and who did not . I recall once telling Charlotte about a village on the Orinoco where female children were ritually cut on the inner thigh by their first sexual partners , the point being to scar the female with the male 's totem . Charlotte saw nothing extraordinary in this , " I mean that 's pretty much what happens everywhere , is n't it , " she said . " Somebody cuts you ? Where it does n't show ? " I keep those cuts that do n't show in mind when I think about Charlotte Douglas 's passage from the house on California Street to the Boca Grande airport . Char. lotte Amelia Douglas . Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not even certain she was talking figuratively. - In the first week after the release of MarM 's tape these events occurred . Charlotte received a call from a young woman in New York who said that Warren would arrive in San Francisco on a midnight plane . Warren did not . . Charlotte received a call from a spiritualist in the Netherlands who said that he perceived the aura of a girl in a pinafore selling tripe in the Belleville section of Paris . He would discuss his vision in detail upon receipt of a first-class airplane ticket to San Francisco , round trip and refundable . The young woman in New York called back to say that Warren had missed the midnight . plane but would arrive in San Francisco the next afternoon . Warren did not . A pair of FBI men came for coffee every morning . An apartment-court manager on the outskirts of Detroit told NBC that he had seen Marin and " two jumped-up coloreds " loading carbines into the trunk of a 1957 Pontiac at dawn in the Livonia Mall parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marin 's companions as " possibly black or Indian " and the car as a 1957 Pontiac " or some later-model General Motors vehicle .

HAT HAVE WE HERE , " Leonard said when he finally walked into the room Charlotte had taken in the Fairmont Hotel . Leonard had addressed a bar luncheon on constitutional law at the Fairmont and a telephone had been brought to the dais and it was Warren calling from New York . Charlotte had watched Leonard take the call from Warren and then she had left the dais and gone to the desk and asked for a room and telephoned Leonard to meet her upstairs when he finished lunch . The room was cold and the radiator jammed off and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet for an hour and ten minutes Charlotte had been sittir , barefoot in the gray afternoon light wearing only the handmade navy-blue silk underwear she had just bought in a shop in the lobby . She had been trying not to remember about Marin or Warren . She had been trying to remember a carnal mood . " No . Do n't tell me , " Leonard said . " Let me guess . You decided the way to avoid seeing Warren was to move to the Fairmont " " I do n't want to talk about Warren , " Charlotte said . " I got him a ride out . " " Do n't talk about him , " Charlotte said . " Come here . " " I know perfectly well what you 're doing . Even if you do n't . " " Do n't talk about it . Do n't laugh . I just want it .

The resuscitator squad . And then an ambulance . And they lowered the flag . " Leonard sat on a chair facing the bed . " I know exactly what you 're trying to do . " " Look You can see the flag .

I say somebody died at the Pacific Union Club , you start talking about having a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leonard kept his eyes on Charlotte but she did not meet them . " Quite honestly I do n't . " " Quite honestly I do n't think you do . Quite honestly I always know what you 're thinking before you do . What you 're thinking now is this : you get yourself pregnant , Warren ca n't get to you . ABC . QED . Do n't ask me why . Where did you get that underwear . " Charlotte said nothing . " Has it ever occurred to you that your primary erogenous zone is your underwear ? " Charlotte had pulled the bedspread closer and smoked a cigarette without speaking and there had not seemed any point in staying in the cold room after that . In the elevator it occurred to her that he had been trying to make her laugh with him but that was another mood she could not remember . In fact she did want a baby . " He apparently called the office and gave Suzy a lot of shit before he got me here . " Leonard nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Suzy calls him . " " I do n't want him to come out here . " " It 's not up to you , Charlotte . Come out of your trance . He wants to come out . " " Then why has n't he . " " You know as well as I do why has n't he , Charlotte , he has n't been able to promote an airplane ticket , that 's why has n't he . " - " He did n't say that . " " Of course he did n't say that . Wake up . " Charlotte concentrated on trying to tie her scarf in the wind . " So as soon as the Q-A was over I made a call and got him a ride out on Bashti Levant 's plane . " " I can ' ? ? , " Charlotte broke off . " You ca n't what . " Charlotte shrugged . " You ca n't what , Charlotte . " " I ca n't see Warren on a small plane with Bashti Levant for five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . Bashti Levant was in the music business . Bashti Levant had " labels , " and three-piece suits and large yellow teeth and obscure Balkan proclivities . " They wo n't like each other . " " No . They wo n't . They will cordially dislike each other and they will entirely entertain each other . That 's not what you were going to say . You ca n't what . " " I ca n't deal with Warren right now . " " What 's to ' deal with ' ? You were married to him , now you 're married to me . You think you 're the only two people in the world who used to fuck and do n't any 9 95. more . " Not at all . " Another thing Charlotte could not deal with was Leonard 's essentially rational view of the sexual connection . " There 's also you and me . " " Not bad . You 're waking up . " Leonard seemed pleased . " Here 's a taxi . " " I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he got into the taxi . Charlotte walked as far as Grace Cathedral and stood for a while just inside the nave in a particular pool of yellow light Marin had liked as a child . When the light shift . ed on the window and there was no more yellow Charlotte left the cathedral . She intended walking back to the Fairmont to get a taxi but there was one idling outside the cathedral , and Leonard was waiting in it , just as he had been waiting in a taxi outside the courthouse the morning she divorced Warren . " She had a straw hat one Easter . " Charlotte had taken Leonard 's hand in the taxi but neither of them spoke until the house on California Street was in sight . " And a flowered lawn dress . " " Do n't think you have to get yourself pregnant just to prove he does n't have you anymore , Charlotte . " " We took her to lunch at the Carlyle , I remember she was cold . " " Do n't make the mistake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlotte . " " Warren gave her his coat . " Leonard said nothing . " And we drank a lot of Ramos fizzes . And in the middle of lunch Warren said he had an appointment downtown . And when the check came I did n't have any money . I did n't even have two dollars for a taxi . Marin and I walked home . " She turned to Leonard . " She was three . Everybody admired her hat . I think I was never so happy on a Sunday . Why are you bringing him out . " " He 's her father , is n't he . " " I ca n't handle it . " Leonard sat on the edge of the bed and picked up the handmade pieces of navy-blue silk from the floor . They were very plain . They had no lace or embroidery . They had only the rows of infinitesimal stitches . " Maybe I want to see if you can . Somebody in the Azores went blind making these . " " Why do you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat , " Leonard said.M2 HOSE WERE FOUR TRULY wonderful specimens you condemned me to fly out here with , " Warren said when he walked into the house on California Street at nine-thirty the next morning . Charlotte stood perfectly still . Warren looked as if he had not slept in several days . His eyes were blood- .. hot his chin - stubbled . He was wearing sneakers and a muffler Charlotte recognized as one she had knit for herself the winter they lived in an unheated apartment on East Ninety-third Street , he was carrying not a suitcase but two shopping ' bags stuffed with what appeared to be dirty laundry . He was also carrying one red rose , which he handed to Charlotte without looking at her . " Four authentic gargoyles , " he said . " Some favor you did me . The four worst people in the world . Climbers . Vermin . Gargoyles . New York trash . Hogarth caricatures . Twenty-five thousand feet , no exit . Deliver me from favors . I need a drink . " " You repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The FBI is due at ten , " Charlotte said . " What 's that got to do with your getting me a drink . Me no get FBI joke . " " I have n't heard that since it was still ' me no get Indian joke , ' " Leonard said . " Which I remember vividly from the night I introduced you to the maharanee of wherever she was from . " " Lower Pelham , " Warren said . " She was the maharanee of Lower Pelham . " He dropped the shopping bags on the floor in front of the fireplace . An aerosol can of shaving cream and a balled seersucker suit stuffed with dirty socks rolled out . " Get somebody to wash and iron that , Charlotte , all right ? The suit just needs pressing . " " We do n't have any washers and ironers on the place today . " Charlotte retrieved the aerosol can before it hit the open fire . " Or any pressers . " " I can see you 're in one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for me today , Charlotte . You think you can give me a drink ? Or ca n't you . " Charlotte filled a glass with ice and splashed bourbon into it . Her hands were shaking . The veins on her arms were standing out and she did not want Warren to see them . When she finally spoke her voice was neutral . " Who exactly was on this plane . " " All friends of yours , I have no doubt . Which reminds me , you look like hell , your veins show . " Warren took the glass . " This Levant creature , whoever he is . " " Bashti Levant controls three out of five pop records sold in America . " Leonard seemed amused . " As you know perfectly well . " " Yeah , well , I had some fun rit his expense , I do n't mind telling you . I had a little fun with him and this fat castrato he had along to bray at his jokes . This pasty Palm Beach castrato . Fawning capon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like him , " Leonard said . " Palm Beach trash hanger-on . I let the women alone . " " The last Southern gentleman , " Leonard said . " Not that they deserved it . Two terrible women . Ter-rible voices , terrihle brays . The castrato only brayed when the Levant creature snapped his fingers , but the women brayed all the time , 3,000 miles of braying . Le island . Le weekend . Les monkey-gland injections . Le New York trash . I believe one of them was married to the Levant creature . Whoever he is , I have no idea . " " That surprises me . Since Leonard just ' told you . " " That surprises you , does it . " Warren rattled the ice in his glass . " You surprise easier than you used to . I suppose this creature is a client of Leonard 's . " " As a matter of fact be is . " " Leonard 's got all the luck . Arabs . Jews . Indians . Bashti Levant . " " Niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How exactly did this creature come to your attention , Leonard ? He rape an Arab ? Or is that possible . Actually I believe that 's a solecism . Raping an Arab . " " You 've had that Arab in the wings , I can tell by your delivery . " Leonard took Warren 's glass and filled it . " I got involved with Bashti on a dope charge a few years ago . Involving certain of his artists . " " I do n't believe what I 'm hearing . Bashti 's artists . " " There was a civil-liberties issue . " " Of course there was . " Warren choked with laughter and slapped his knee . " I knew there was . " " There was , " Charlotte said . In the silence that followed she could hear her voice echo , harsh and ugly . She fixed her eyes on the ring Leonard had brought her from wherever he had gone to meet the man who financed the Tupanaros . The square emerald ring . The big square emerald from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voice , " Warren said . " Let 's have that tone of voice again . " Leonard looked at Charlotte and shook his head slightly . Charlotte picked up a cigarette and lit it . " No wonder your daughter left home , " Warren said . The red rose Warren had given Charlotte fell from the table to the floor . Charlotte said nothing . " All J hold against your daughter is she did n't catch Bashti Levant with that pipe bomb . Bashti and certain of his artists . That 's the only bone I want to pick with your daughter . Your daughter and mine . " " He does n't mellow , " Leonard said finally . " What did you expect , Leonard ? You expect I 'd hit forty-five and start applauding the family of man ? " Warren drained his second drink . " It 's my birthday , Charlotte . You have n't wished me happy birthday . " " I 'll tell you something I expected , I expected --  " Charlotte broke off . She did not know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogota . Quito . She had no idea where Leonard had met the man who financed the Tupamaros . " Today 's not your birthday , " she said finally . " Your birthday was last month . " " Your husband expected a humanist . " " Leonard , " Leonard said . " Pardon ? " " Her husband 's name is Leonard. ? " I stole that rose for you , " Warren said . " Off the flight of the living dead . " KNOW WHY CHARLOTTE liked talking to the FBI : the agents would let her talk about Marin . Their devotion to MarM seemed total . They were pilgrims pledged to the collection of relics from Marin 's passion . During the days before Warren arrived in San Francisco the agents had taken Charlotte to see Marin 's apartment on Haste Street in Berkeley . The agents had taken Charlotte to see the house on Grove Street in Berkeley where they had found the cache of .30-caliber Browning automatic rifles and the translucent pink orthodontal retainer Marin was supposed to wear to correct her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell through dusty windows onto worn hardwood floors and Charlotte had remembered how sad she herself had been at Berkeley before Warren came to her door . " Let 's flop back to one of the theories you were espousing yesterday , Mrs. Douglas . When you ? " " Let 's flop back to all of them , " Warren said . Warren had been sitting in the same chair ever since be walked into the house and dropped his shopping bags . He had gotten up only to get himself drinks and once , perfunctorily , when the FBI men arrived and Leonard left , " I 'm the felon 's father , " he had said to the FBI men . He seemed bent now in a fit of laughter . " I want to flop back to every one of these theories Mrs. Douglas has been espousing . In my absence . I 've been out of touch , I did n't know Mrs. Douglas had theories . To espouse . " " When I what , " Charlotte said . " Flip flop . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The FBI man glanced uneasily at Warren . " When you said yesterday that Marin ' might have been sad ' what exactly did you mean ? Normal everyday blues ? Or something more , uh , out of the mainstream ? " " Just your normal everyday mainstream power-to-thepeople latifundismo Berkeley blues . " Warren was still bent with laughter . " Just those old Amerikan blues . Spell that with a K. " " I do n't knoW what I meant . " Charlotte said . " Some theory , " Warren said . " Did you get the K ? Did you spell it with a K ? " " To push on for a moment , Mrs. Douglas , the office raised one other question . Did your daughter ever mention a Russian , name of , uh , Iet 's see . " The FBI man examined his notebook . " Those old Amerikan blues did n't come up the river from New Orleans , they K-O-M-E up the river from New Orleans . Get it ? Charlotte ? Did he get the K ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the FBI man said . " Russian , name of Gurdjieff . Marin ever mention him ? " " In the first place he was an Armenian , " Warren said . " Otherwise you 're on top of the case . " " I 'm not sure I get your meaning , Mr. Bogart . " " Not at all . You 're doing fine . " " Excuse me . The Gurdjieff I 'm thinking of is a Rus-sian . " " Excuse me . The Gurdjieff you 're thinking of is Bashti Levant . " " Warren . Please . " " Do n't you think that 's funny , Charlotte ? ' Excuse me , the Gurdjieff you 're thinking of is Bashti Levant ' ? " " It 's funny , Warren . Now ? " " You used to think I was funny . " " Let me try to put this on track . " The FBI man cleared his throat . " Marin ever mention a Gurdjieff of any nationality ? Ever mention reading about him ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren said . " She plays a good game of tennis , she 's got a nice backhand , good strong hair and an IQ of about 103 . " Charlotte closed her eyes . " Charlotte . Face facts . Credit where credit is due , you raised her . She 's boring . " " I 'm not sure this is a productive tack , " the FBI man said . " Irving 's not sure this is a productive tack . " Warren rattled his ice . " Hear , hear , Charlotte . Listen to Irving . " " Bruno , " the FBI man said . " The name is Bruno Furetta . " " Do n't mind me , Irving , I 've been drinking . " " I happen to know you 're not all that drunk , Warren . " Charlotte did not open her eyes . " I happen to know you 're just amusing yourself . As usual . " " You get the picture . " Charlotte stood up . " And I want to tell you I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren say as she fled the room . " Let me give you some advice , Irving . Never mind the Armenians , cherehez te tennis pro . " 00 II00 , " WARREN SAID when he came upstairs an hour later . " What happened to your sense of humor . " Charlotte said nothing . She did not want Warren in the room . She did not want Warren to be in any room where she slept with Leonard , did not avant him to see Leonard 's Seeonal and her hand cream together on the table by the bed , did not want to see him examining the neckties that Leonard had that morning tried , rejected , and left on the bed . In fact she did not want him to see the bed at all . " We do n't have anything in common anymore . " Warren picked up a yellow silk tie and knotted it around his collar . " You and me . Leonard wo n't miss this , he 's jaundiced enough . You ever noticed ? He 's got bad color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we both agree that as far as having anything in common goes ? " Charlotte broke off . She was watching a tube of KY jelly on the table by the bed . She did not see any way to move it into the drawer without attracting Warren 's attention . " As far as having anything in common goes wedo n't have anything . In common . " " You sound like you had a stroke . You had a stroke ? " " I happen to have a headache . " " You mean I happen to give you a headache . " " I mean I want you to leave this room . " " Do n't worry , I 'll leave this room . " Warren sat on the bed , picked up the tube of KY jelly and put it in the drawer . " I do n't like this room . " Charlotte said nothing . " I only flew out here to see how you were . " Still Charlotte said nothing . " I do n't like your room , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Warren picked up a silver box from the table by the bed . The box hell marijuana and played " Puff , the Magic Dragon " when the lid was lifted . Warren lifted the lid and looked at Charlotte . " I bet the two of you talk about ' turning on . ' See what I mean about your life ? " " Go away , " Charlotte whispered . " Excuse me . I mean your life-style . ' You do n't have a life , you have a life-style . ' You still look good , though , " " Go away . " Warren looked at her for a while , before he spoke . " I want you to come to New Orleans with me . " Charlotte tried to concentrate on meeting Leonard for lunch . Very soon she would walk out of this room and down the stairs . She would walk out of this house and she would take a taxi to the Tadich Grill , alone . " I said I want you to come to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She would go in the taxi alone to meet Leonard at the Tadich Grill . " I want you to see Porter with me . Porter is dying . Porter wants to see you . Do this one thing for me . " Charlotte tried to keep her mind on whether to order sand dabs or oysters at the Tadich Grill . Porter was a distant cousin of Warren 's . During the five years Charlotte and Warren were married Porter had invested $25,000 in an off-Broadway play that Warren never wrote , $30,000 in a political monthly that Warren never took beyond its dummy issue , and $2,653.84 in ransoming Warren 's and her furniture and Marin 's baby clothes from the Seven Santini Brothers Storage Company in Long Island City . Charlotte did not even like Porter . " If you wo n't do it for me you 'll do it for Porter . Or you 're a worse human being than even I think . " " I ca n't just leave . Can I. " " You 're not leaving , you 're paying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " I ca n't forgive Porter what he said to Leonard . At dinner out here . Two years ago . He behaved badly . " In fact Charlotte could not even recall what Porter had said to Leonard , but whenever she talked to Warren she fell helplessly into both his diction and his rosary of other people 's disloyalties . " I just ca n't forgive Porter that at all . " " Porter loves you . " " Leonard had to ask him to leave the house . " " What 's that got to do with you . " There did not seem to Charlotte any ground on which this question could safely be met . She put it from her mind . " I said what 's that got to do with you . " Charlotte stood up , walked to the dressing room , and took a coat from the closet . " Porter 's dying , Charlotte . " Charlotte put her coat over her shoulders . " Porter 's dying and you 're putting on your mink coat . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your life ? " " It 's not mink . It 's sable . I have a lunch date . " " Say that again . " " I said : I have a lunch date . With Leonard . " " Do n't let me keep you . Somebody who loves you is dying , your only child is lost , I 'm asking you one last favor , and you 've got a lunch date . " Warren opened the lid of the silver box again . The mechanism began to play . " You getting it ? You getting the picture ? You 're never going to see Marin again but never mind , you 've got a lunch date ? And maybe after your ' lunch date ' you and your interesting husband can , what do you call it , ' get stoned ' ? " " You Jack , " Charlotte screamed . Warren smiled . Charlotte grabbed up a pair of scissors and clutched them , point out . Charlotte 's sable coat fell to the floor . " You walk into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name except to make fun of her . You try to use Marin on me , you do n't give a fuck about ? " Warren still smiled . The music box still played " Puff , the Magic Dragon . " Charlotte looked at her hand and opened it and the scissors fell to the floor . " About Marin , " she said . " Time and fevers , " Warren said finally . His voice was tired . " Burn away . " " I do n't know what you 're saying . " " I 'm not saying , babe . I 'm quoting . ' And the grave proves the child ephemeral . ' Who am I quoting . " " Shakespeare . Milton . I do n't know who you 're quot ? ing . Make that thing stop playing . " " Auden . W. H. Auden . You are n't any better read than you ever were , I 'll give you that . " Warren closed the box and picked up Charlotte 's coat from the floor . " ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature lie . ' Where 's your lunch . " " I ca n't go to lunch . " She stood Iike a child and let Warren put the coat on her shoulders . " I ca n't go to lunch crying . " " Where was your lunch . " " Tadich 's . " " Sure , " Warren said . " Let 's eat some fish . " Warren entertained Leonard at lunch with news of an automotive heir they both knew who was devoting his fortune to Micronesian independence ; excused himself five times to make telephone calls ; cancelled the oysters Leonard had ordered - for Charlotte because Pacific oysters would not compare with Gulf oysters ; ordered oysters himself , drank three gin Martinis and a German beer , fed Charlotte with his own fork because she was too thin not to eat , left the restaurant before Leonard ordered coffee and did not reappear that afternoon or evening . In the morning Charlotte told Leonard that she could not stay in the same house with Warren . Leonard moved Warren to a motel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . Charlotte stayed upstairs until they were gone . I understand what Warren Bogart could do to Charlotte Douglas because I met him , later , once in New Orleans : he had the look of a man who could drive a woman like Charlotte right off her head . I have no idea what I mean by " a woman like Char-lotte . " I suppose I mean only a woman so convinced of the danger that lies in the backward glance . I might have said a woman so unstable , but I told you , Charlotte performed the tracheotomy , Charlotte dropped the clinic apron at the colonel 's feet . I am less and less convinced that the word unstable has any useful meaning except insofar as it describes a chemical compound . N THE SECOND WEEK after the release of Marin 's tape Leonard flew to Montreal to meet with leaders of a Greek liberation movement . A man who described himself as a disillusioned Scientulogist called Charlotte to say that Marin was under the influence of a Clear in Shasta Lake . A mas- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received definite word from Edgar Cayce via Mass Mind that Marin was with the Hunzas in the Himalayas . Charlotte watched the rain blowing across California Street . Leonard flew from Montreal to Chicago to speak at a Days of Rage memorial . " You want to see bad teeth , get on down here , " Warren said to Charlotte the first night he telephoned . He was calling not from the motel in the Marina but from the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel , where he had flown with Bashti Levant and one of his English bands . " The algae on the genetic pool . They drink Mai Tais . Get it ? " " I do n't understand what you 're doing there . " " I 'm not screwing their women , if that 's what you think . Not even with yours , Basil . Basil . " Ian . " Andrew . ' English Jews . You over your homicidal mood ? " Charlotte said nothing . " The women all had lobotomies at fourteen , but the teeth stop me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you . " " What exactly is Porter dying of . " " Porter is dying of that long disease , his life . Alexander Pope , lost on you . Never mind what Porter 's dying of . Do it for me . " " I do n't even believe Porter 's dying . If Porter were dying I would n't think you 'd be hanging around the Beverly Hills Hotel . With people you say you ca n't stand . " " I 'm not ' hanging around , ' Charlotte , I 'm ' hanging out . ' The phrase is ' hanging out . ' You always did have a tin ear . Will you come to New Orleans or wo n't you . " " I wo n't . " " Why wo n't you . " " Because if I went to New Orleans with you , " Char-lotte said , " I would end up murdering you . I would take a knife and murder you . In your sleep . " " I do n't sleep anyway . " Charlotte said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Go , do n't go . Come , do n't come . Murder me , do n't murder me . I 'm only telling you what you have to do for your own peace of mind . " " I have had that shit , " Charlotte whispered , and hung up . " I would bet my life on your having some character , " Warren said the second night he telephoned from the Beverly Hills Hotel . " Lucky for me I did n't . " Charlotte said nothing , " Not that it matters . Not that it 's worth anything . My life . " Charlotte said nothing . " You 're going to remember this , Charlotte . I tried to tell you what to do . You 're going to lie awake and remember this for the rest of your miserable unfortunate life . " Charlotte said nothing . Charlotte believed that there was something faniiliar about this telephone call but for a moment she could not put her finger on what it was . There had been something else she was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable unfortunate life . Leaving him . That was it . She tried to put that other telephone call back out of her mind . It must have been after she left him , the other telephone call , because she had never exactly told him that she was leaving him . She had told him that she was going to her mother 's funeral . This was true but not the whole truth . Her mother had just died and she was going to have some money to take care of herself and Marin and she did nut want to give the money to Warren and she took Marin and flew out of Idlewild and never went back . " You hear me , Charlotte ? " She had cried all the way to San Francisco and Marin had been asleep on her lap and she remembered the landing and MarM 's pale hair damp and sticky with sleep and tears . " Charlotte ? They ever mention sins of omission in those wonderful Okie schools you went to ? " For the rest of that week when the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as she heard Warren 's voice . A few days later a copy of Time arrived with a photograph that showed Charlotte leaving the house on California Street with her hands over her face , and Charlotte wrote a letter to the editor pointing out that the description of her as a " reclusive socialite " was a contradiction in terms . Leonard returned froth Chicago and asked Charlotte not to mail the letter . " I just remembered I never told Warren I was leaving him , " Charlotte said to Leonard . " He 's had fifteen years , I guess he 's figured it out , " Leonard said to Charlotte . " I mean I just kissed him goodbye at Idlewild and said I 'd be back in a week and I knew I would n't be . " " 1 know it . " " How could you know it . " " Because that 's how you 'll leave me . " " Fourteen years , " Charlotte said . " Not fifteen , Four-teen . " HARLOTTE DID NOT GET OUT of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the safe-deposit box . " I 'm not sure your daughter appreciates the legal bind she 's put you in , Char . " Pete Wright was examining some stock certificates . Charlotte had known Pete Wright longer than she had known Leonard . He had roomed at Stanford with Dickie and he had handled her divorce from Warren and as Leonard 's junior partner he had paid a Christmas call every year with a suitable present for Marin , but there in the safe-deposit vault of the Wells Fargo Bank on Powell Street he had kept referring to Marin as " your daughter . " Charlotte did not want to hear about the legal bind she was in and she did not want Pete Wright to call her Char . Only Dickie called her Char . There was something else about Pete Wright that bothered her but she did not want to think about that either . " You 're in a hit of a pickle here , Char . " " That 's exactly what you said when I left Warren . And vou took this enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charlotte took a gold pin of her grandmother 's from the safe-deposit box . Charlotte imagined the gold pin attached to the firing pin of a bomb . Pete Wright had come to New York once when she was married to Warren . " And I was n't . " " You were n't what . " " I was n't in a bit of a pickle . " " I have nothing but respect for Leonard as a lawyer , Charlotte , but , as you know , Leonard leaves the estate work to me . " Pete Wright took a deep breath . " Now . What we have here are stock certificates worth X dollars a quarter in dividends ? " " Eight hundred and seven , $807 a quarter . I looked it up when you called me . " " What I 'm saying , Charlotte , is that these particular certificates are in your and your daughter 's names as joint tenants . Her signature ? " " I can forge it , ca n't 1 . " " Not legally , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checks . It 's $807 a quarter , it 's nothing . " The gold pin had a broken clasp . As Charlotte held the pin in her fingers she had an abrupt physical sense of eating chicken a la king and overdone buiscuits at her grandmother 's house in Hollister . Pete Wright . Pete Wright had been in New York once and had  - -  11.11711111M1 " , -I 1 taken her to the Palm for dinner . " What may seem ' nothing ' to you Charlotte ? " " I suppose you 're about to tell me that $807 a quarter is the average annual income for a grape picker . Is that what you 're about to tell me ? " " I 'm about to overlook your hostility . " " Leonard leaves the estate work to you , you leave the grape pickers to Leonard , is that fair ? " " We used to be friends , Charlotte , and I like to think ? " She could taste the soft bits of pimento in the chicken a la king . She could smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell citronella , and calamine lotion , and the sweetened milky emulsion in prescription bottles that contained aureomycin . She could taste the acrid goat cheese her father used to get from the man who ran his cattle on the ranch . Iler father had died . She could feel crushed and browning in her hand the camellias her mother used to braid into her hair for birthday parties . Her mother had died . She had erased burned biscuits and citronella when Warren came to her door in Berkeley , and she seemed to have been busy since , but there in the safe-deposit vault of the Wells Fargo Bank on Powell Street she was not so busy . She had erased some other things too . She had been ' too busy . She had gotten drunk at the Palm with Pete Wright . " I gather by your silence you think Warren might oppose it . " " Oppose what ? " Charlotte said . " Oppose declaring your daughter legally dead . " Charlotte looked at Pete Wright . ' " It 's a legality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cash these particular dividend checks . " Charlotte picked up the certificates . " As well as clarify the question of the ranch . Which I feel impelled to remind you is tied up in trust for her . A loose trust , granted . but ? " Charlotte tore the certificates in half . Pete Wright gazed at the wall behind Charlotte and made a sucking noise with his teeth . " Warren 's quite disturbed . I do n't know if you realize that . He comes by the house , he drinks too much , he jumps all over Clarice abOut her hatha yoga class , he acts like ? " Her mother had died . Warren had not come home the night she got drunk at the Palm with Pete Wright . " You do n't need to tell me what Warren acts like .

People were loose in the world and left it , and she had been too busy , to notice . The morning after she got drunk at the Palm she and Warren had taken Marin to lunch at the Carlyle . Marin was cold . " I 'm trying to talk to you like a Dutch uncle , " Pete Wright said . Warren gave her his coat . " I think I fucked you one Easter , " Charlotte said . For the next several days Charlotte wanted only to eat the food she had eaten in Hollister but she had lost the recipes her mother had written out and Charlotte did not know the number of any couple who would come to the house on California Street and do chicken a la king and burned biscuits . When I think of Charlotte Douglas apprehending death at the age of thirty-nine in the safe-deposit vault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some advantage in having a mother who died when I was eight , a father who died when I was ten , before I was busy . HARLOTTE DID NOT GET OUT of bed the day after she met the woman named Enid Schrader . " Mark spoke so very highly of you , " the woman had said on the telephone . There had been in Enid Schrader 's voice something Charlotte did not want to recognize : a forced gaiety , a haggard sprightliness , a separateness not unlike her own . " Of you and your beautiful home . " Mark Schrader was said to have been on the L-1011 with Marin . Mark Schrader had on his face , in the pictures Charlotte had seen of him , a pronounced scar from a harelip operation . it did not seem plausible to Charlotte that she could have met a boy with such a scar and forgotten him , nor did it seem plausible that anyone on the L-1011 with Marin had ever spoken highly of the house on California Street , but maybe the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a code in that peculiar stilted diction . Maybe Enid Schrader knew where Marin was . " I think we should meet , " Charlotte said guardedly . " Could you have lunch at all ? Today ? The St. Francis Grill ? " " Delightful . Why . " " Why what ? " " Why the St. Francis Grill ? " " I just thought ? " Charlotte did not know what she had just thought . She had rejected the house because it was watched . She had hit upon the St. Francis Grill as a place where all corners of the room could be seen . " Is there somewhere you 'd rather go ? " " Not at all , I do n't keep up with where the beautiful people eat . Not to worry about my recognizing you , I 've seen pictures of you . " " I 've seen pictures of you too . " " Before , " the woman said . " I meant before . Pictures of you and your beautiful home . " Charlotte had met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman did not seem interested in talking about her son , or about Marin . The woman seemed interested instead in talking about a friend who had a decorator 's card . " You 'll adore Ruthie . " The woman was drinking dai-quiris and had refused lunch . " I 'm getting you together soonest , that 's definite , a promise . Meanwhile I 'll borrow her card and we 'll do the trade-only places . How 's Tuesday . " " How 's Tuesday for what , " Charlotte said faintly . " Monday 's a no-no for me but if Tuesday 's bad for you , let 's say Wednesday . Earliest . " " Listen . " Charlotte glanced around the room before she spoke . " If there 's something to see I think we should  --  I mean , could we see it now ? " " But I have n't got Ruthie 's card . I mean unless you have ? " The woman looked up . " What 's the matter . " " I do n't think I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about taking you shopping . " The woman 's eyes reddened and filled with tears . " Unless of course you 're too busy . But of course you are . Too busy . " Charlotte touched the woman 's hand . The last woman Charlotte had known to talk about " shopping " was her mother . The last time Charlotte had been asked to go " shop-ping " it had been by her mother . " Your ex-husband is n't too busy . I heard him on the radio . He was blotto but he talked to me . I called in to chat , he was n't too busy to chat . Although blotto . On the radio . Whatever his name is . " " Warren . " Charlotte did not want to hear about Warren on the radio . Leonard had once said that Warren could arrive in a town where he knew no one and within twenty-four hours he would have had dinner at the country club , been offered a temporary chair in Southern politics at the nearest college , and been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren on the radio and she did not want to think why Enid Schrader was crying and she did not want to think about her mother shopping . Her mother had been shopping a the day she died , at Ransohoff's. " ills name is Warren Bogart , " " Whatever . The little whore 's father . " The woman gave one last cathartic sob . Charlotte reached for the check . " My treat , " the woman cried , her voice again sprightly . " You do it next time . " All the next day Charlotte could not erase from her mind the first newspaper picture she had seen of Enid Schrader 's son . " They 'll ditch the harelip , " Leonard had said when she showed him the picture . " The harelip 's the fresh meat they 'll throw on the trail , they ca n't afford him , Marin 's not stupid . " " I would n't rely on that , " Warren had said . Another picture Charlotte could not erase from her mind was her mother alone at Ransohoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight back , I watch my own . plane blow a tire on closed-circuit TV , I go to my office , I find Suzy in tears because Warren camped in her one-room apartment , I come home and I find my wife has n't gotten dressed in two days . I finish this call , Charlotte , I 'm going to trot your ass over to Polly Orben 's office , this is n't healthy . " Leonard uncupped the receiver and spoke into it . " Try the other line , Suzy , see if you can keep your finger off the disconnect this time . " " Why do n't you trot Suzy 's ass over to Polly Orben 's office , " Charlotte said without turning around . She was watching the FBI man in the window of the apartment across the street . " Why do n't you trot Warren 's ass over to Polly Orben 's office . " " Tell him we 're going to trade off the felony and plead the two misdemeanors , " Leonard said into the telephone . " Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And tell him 1 do n't want any of that boom-boom shit at the hearing . " Leonard hung up the telephone . " Speaking of Warren he says you wo n't see him . He says you misunderstand him , " " The luck I misunderstand him . " " Felicitously put , " Leonard said after a while . " Tell him I 'm in Hollister . Tell him I 'm in Hollister and about how there 's no telephone on the ranch . " " There are eight telephones on the ranch . On three separate lines . " " He does n't know that " " For Christ 's sake , Charlotte , go to Hollister if you do n't want to see him . Go now . Go right now . " " I ca n't actually go to Hollister . " " Why ca n't you , besides the fact that it might entail getting dressed . She could not go to Hollister because she was afraid Warren might find her there , alone at the ranch . She could not go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch something bad would happen . This seemed so obvious to Charlotte that she could not bring herself to say it . " 1 ca n't go to Hollister because you have people coming to the house for lunch tomorrow . " " Tell me who I have coming to the house for lunch to-morrow . " " Coming to the house for lunch tomorrow you have .. " She could not think . " Coming to the house for lunch tomorrow I have ... the leaders of ... two dissident factions within ... the Haight  --  Divisadero Coalition . You got a whole lot you want to say to them ? " Charlotte picked up a brush and began attacking her hair in abrupt chops . " On the subject of day-care versus guerrilla theater ? Maybe we could get Dickie and Linda up from Hollister get =ret their thinking ? " " I do n't know why you put all those telephones on the ranch anyway . " " I do n't know , Charlotte . Communication ? " " Nobody in my family ever found it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nobody in your family ever found it necessary to pay the taxes on that ranch , either . Tell me again why you ca n't go to Hollister . " The hair Charlotte pulled from her brush was dry and wiry and faded . When Marin was small she had played a game with Charlotte 's hair and called it gold . nEmm ? ? ? ? Aillarlerjr . " I feel su old , " Charlotte said . " Tell me why you ca n't go to Hollister . " " I keep remembering things . " " Most of us do . Tell me why you wo n't see Warren . " " You do n't know what he wants . " " Of course I know what he wants . He wants you back . You think I make my living being dense ? " " Then why did you ask . " Leonard lifted a mass of Charlotte 's hair and let it drop through his fingers . " Because I was interested in whether you knew it . You do n't look so oid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe she thought it was easier . Maybe she believed herself loose in the world , maybe she was tired , may . be she had just remembered that peo-ple died . Maybe she thought that if she walked back into the Carlyle Ho . tel on Easter morning with Warren Bogart Marin would be there , in a flowered lawn dress . " Ifs too late , " she said to her gynecologist the morning he confirmed that she was carrying Leonard 's child . " It did n't happen in time . " Somebody cuts you . Where it does n't show . I have no way of knowing about the cuts that do n't show . I know only that during the fifth week after the release of Marin 's tape Charlotte woke early every morning , dressed promptly , and immersed herself in the domestic maintenance of the house on California Street . She made inventories . She replaced worn sheets , chipped wine glasses , crazed plates . She paid an electrician time-and-a-half to rewire , on a Saturday . two crossed spots on the Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands , and she laid it to her pregnancy . Leonard did not . So entirely underwater did Charlotte live her life that she did not recognize her preoccupations as those of a woman about to abandon a temporary rental . Leonard did . HOTOGRAPHS OF THE LAST evening Charlotte spent with Leonard Douglas appeared a year later in Vogue , Charlotte showed them to me . There was Leonard , standing with an actor at the party in Beverly Hills , standing with his head bent , listening to the actor but looking somewhere else . There was Charlotte , sitting with an actress at the party in Beverly Hills , Charlotte smiling , her eyes wide and glazed and in the end as impenetrable as Marin 's . She had not meant to go with Leonard to the party in Beverly Hills at all . She had not even meant to go with Leonard to the airport . But on the fifth day of the fifth week after the release of Marin 's tape she had opened the door of the house on California Street and found Warren standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " " Actually I 'm just about to drive Leonard to the airport . " She followed his gaze to the limousine idling at the curb . She had not until the moment intended going to the airport . " I mean , I 'm not exactly driving him to the airport but I 'm driving with him to the airport . " " I guess there 's room for me . " In the car Charlotte had sat on the jump seat and fixed her eyes on the driver 's pigtail , " While you were upstairs Warren was telling me about this ninety-two-year-old Trotskyist he drinks with in New York , " Leonard said . " This Trotskyist lives at the Hotel Albert . Naturally . " " Charlotte knows Benny , " Warren said . " You remember Benny , Charlotte . " Charlotte had not remembered Benny . Charlotte had not even thought that she was meant to remember Benny , whoever Benny was . Benny was only Warren 's way of reminding her that he had a prior claim . " This Trotskyist drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Warren said . " Not Pisco sours . Sazeracs . Benny always asks about you , Charlotte . You ought to go see him , he 's not going to live forever . " Charlotte kept her eyes on the driver 's pigtail . " Neither is Porter , " Warren said . " In case you forgot . " " Neither is Charlotte , " Leonard said . " You keep this up . Something I 've never been able to understand is how you happen to know more Trotskyists than Trotsky did . " " You know more Arabs , it evens out . What am I going to tell Porter , Charlotte . " " All of them ninety-two years old , " Leonard said . " I said what am I going to tell Porter , Charlotte . " " All of them sitting around the Hotel Albert drinking Pisco sours , " Leonard said . " Sazeracs . What do you want me to tell Porter on his deathbed , Charlotte . " " Personally I want you to tell Porter about this ninetytwo-year-old Trotskyist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , Warren . You 're pushing her too hard while she 's still got an ace . I 'll lay you odds , she 's going to see her ace . She 's going to say she 's coming with me . " " But I am . " Charlotte looked at Leonard for the first time . " I am definitely coming with you . I always was . " " No , " Leonard said . " You were not ' always ' coming with me . You see , Warren ? Bad hand . You did n't pace your play . " " But I always wanted to go with you , " Charlotte said . " Definitely you always wanted to go with him , " Warren said . " You have n't met enough Arabs . " " He 's going to Los Angeles and Miami , " Charlotte said . " Or enough Jews , " Warren said . Because Charlotte had gotten on the plane with no bag and because Leonard 's presence was required at the party I where the photographs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house in Beverly Hills , Charlotte was wearing , at the time she was photographed , a dress borrowed from the wife of the record executive who had organized the evening , a dress made entirely of colored ribbons . " You should n't have told Warren to keep the car , " she had said as she put on the dress . " He 'll keep it all night . I look absurd . " " You would n't if you had a tambourine , " Leopard said . " He 'll keep it all week . " Charlotte sat down . She was very tired . She did not think she had ever been so tired . She did not see how she could finish tying the ribbons on the dress . " Sometimes I wish , " Leonard said after a while . He began tying the ribbons Charlotte had abandoned . " I do n't know . " " Sometimes you wish what . " " Sometimes I wish you could just fuck him and get it over with . " " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want to . " A stage had been constructed over the swimming pool of the house in Beverly Hills and several entertainers auctioned their services , singing and dancing and placing surprise telephone calls to friends and relatives of high bidders . Leonard raised $500 by dancing the limbo under a pole held by the record executive 's wife , a young woman with pale blond hair like Marin 's and a Brahmin caste mark painted on her forehead , and , at Charlotte 's table , an actress who had visited Hanoi spoke of the superior health and beauty of the children there . " It 's because they are n't raised by their mothers , " the actress said . " They do n't have any of that bourgeois personal crap laid on them . " Charlotte studied her wine glass and tried to think of something neutral to say to the actress . She wanted to get up but her chair was blocked by three men who seemed to be discussing the financing of a motion picture , or a war . " No mama-papa-baby-nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beautiful . " Charlotte concentrated on the details of the financing , the part to be played by the Canadians , the controls exert- ed by the Credit - Suisse . " I know why you 're crying , " the actress said after a while . Morocco would lend its army . Spain would not . Two-eight above the line . " And I 'm sorry , but that 's exactly the kind of personal crap I never saw in Hanoi . " The flash bulb blazed . Charlotte smiled . The flash bulb dropped on the table . " Did you know I spent a night once with Pete Wright , " Charlotte said to Leonard as he led her from the table . " Did you know I did that and forgot it . " " You did n't forget it at all , " Leonard said . " You told me the first night I met you . " " I am so tired . I am so tired of remembering things . Leonard . Tell me it 's because I 'm pregnant . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte back to the Beverly Wilshire but she continued crying , so Leonard , because he was due in Miami the next day to assist in the sale of four French Mirages from one Caribbean independency to another , called the record executive and borrowed a company Lear to fly Charlotte home . Two hundred sixteen thousand dollars was raised that night to benefit some one of Leonard 's clients , Charlotte was unsure which until she saw the pictures in Vogue . She left the dress made entirety of colored ribbons on the floor of the suite at the Beverly Wilshire . I look at those pictures now and I see only Charlotte 's smile . HEN WARREN CAME to the door of the house on California Street Charlotte did not appear . When Warren telephoned the house Charlotte hung up without speaking . When Warren stood outside the house on California Street at two A.M. and threw stones at the windows Charlotte closed the shutters . When Warren left the note reading , " THIS IS THE WORST BEHAVIOR YET " in the mailbox of the house on California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms which fronted on the street . When the two FBI men came to tell Charlotte that the boy with the harelip scar had been apprehended on an unrelated charge in Nogales , Arizona , and had hung himself in his cell Charlotte left the room without speaking . That was on the second day of the sixth week after the release of Marin 's tape . " You 're aware Mark Schrader killed himself in Mexico , " the reporter said on the telephone . " Arizona , " Charlotte said . She was still lying on Marin 's bed . The sound of the man 's voice hurt her ear and she held the receiver several inches away . " About Mark and Marin ? " " Arizona . Not Mexico . He killed himself in Nogales , Arizona . " " Absolutely . My slip . Would you say that Marin was romantically involved with Mark ? " " Romantically involved , " Charlotte repeated . " Involved in a romantic way , yes . " The harelip 's the fresh meat they 'll throw on the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . I would n't rely on that . " You see you 're thinking of Nogales , Sonora , " Charlotte said . " Absolutely , " the reporter said . " Very good . About Mark and ? " " You do n't have to congratulate me . For knowing the difference between Arizona and Mexico . " " About Marin and ? " Marin had a straw hat one Easter and a flowered lawn dress . This is the worst behavior yet . Warren gave her his coat . " Fuck Marin , " Charlotte said .
