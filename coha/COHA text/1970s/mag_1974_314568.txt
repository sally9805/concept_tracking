As it demonstrated by orchestrating the Arab oil embargo , Saudi Arabia is the kingpin of world petroleum supply and prices . Last week it exercised its power once more , this time against the eleven other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . <P> At a stormy OPEC meeting of government ministers ( see pictures , top and bottom this page ) in Quito , Ecuador , the Saudis blocked yet another sizable increase in oil prices-though they had to settle for a tiny one . <P> It was essentially a holding action . The Saudis have argued that the posted price of oil , on which the taxes and royalties paid by oil companies are based , should be cut by $2 or more from its present lofty $11.65 per bbl . They fear that sky-high oil prices will create unmanageable trade deficits for their customers . The Saudis also hope that by cutting oil prices they can negotiate a better deal on the technology , goods and services that they hope to import from industrialized nations , as well as hold back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are anathema within OPEC . At the Quito meeting , Venezuela , Algeria , Libya , Nigeria and Kuwait pushed hard for a 63 increase in posted prices to offset the effects of inflation on the prices of the goods that they buy from the U.S. , Europe and Japan . Iranian Finance Minister Jamshid Amuzegar , who has accused the Saudis of hypocritically calling for price reductions while actually raising prices , favored a slightly smaller hike , " to show the industrialized nations that we are serious when we say that they must keep inflation in check . " Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani reportedly threatened to force prices down by dumping millions of barrels of cut-price petroleum on the market . In order to keep the cartel together , the delegates settled on a compromise that will hold posted prices steady but raise by 2% the royalties that they collect on each barrel from the companies . That works out to a mere 5 per bbl. , or roughly one-eighth cent on a gallon of gasoline . <P> How Low ? The Saudis went along - for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an OPEC meeting scheduled to be held in Vienna on Sept. 12 , they will be in an even stronger position . Last week Yamani journeyed to Washington in an attempt to persuade the U.S. to put more pressure on Iran to lower its prices . <P> More important , the Saudis hope to complete negotiations for full ownership of the Arabian American Oil Co . Only two weeks ago they completed an interim deal that raised their ownership from 25% to 60%-a move with ironic consequences in light of their stated desire to lower prices . Under the complicated oil pricing system , the four American oil companies ( Exxon , Texaco , Standard of California and Mobil ) that have part-ownership of Aramco will have to " buy back " 60% of Aramco 's daily output at 93% of the posted price , raising the market price of Saudi crude by about $1 per bbl . But when the Saudis take complete control of Aramco , they will have to set directly whatever price they think suitable-and the world is waiting to see how low it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
