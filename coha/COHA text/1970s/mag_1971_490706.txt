THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE midnight knock on the door of the unsuspecting citizen has long been a standard percussion sound in totalitarian countries . Americans have now  --  thanks to the testimony of former Army Staff Sergeant John M. O'Brien at hearings in a federal suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several citizens who wanted the Army to stop spying on them  --  been given a preview of that ominous rap in a form modified to suit a bourgeois consumer society . O'Brien is an alumnus of the Army 's diligent 113th Intelligence Group , the outfit that maintained files and conducted stir-y eillance on eight imndred civilians in the Chicago area , including Adlai E. Stevenson III , Representative Abner J. ' t4ikva , former Governor Otto Kerner , and reporters for the Chicago Daily . Nett ' . and the Chicago Sun-Tinu . The intrusion specified in O'Brien 's testimin ) was the inspiration of a group of agents , including O'Brien himself , who were conducting a stakeout of a house in suburban Wilmette where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held . Not content to cop the license numbers of those who showed up , the agents arranged  --  and here comes the consumer-oriented midnight knock  --  to have an order of unordered pizzas sent into the house that was under surveillance . On a national list of current injustices this may rank low , but we ca n't get it out of our mind . We suspect that we will never again he able to open our door to an unordered pizza , or answer our phone late at night to hear that we have won a dance lesson we had n't asked for , or read an insistent letter from a charity we hoped had never heard of us , without wondering fleetingly just how we have stepped out of line . Sequence DVANE TVItettALs is a thirty-eight ) ear-old photographer who used to specialize in shooting empty rooms . ( " People who did New York always did Times Square . People do n't live in Times Square . I shot the- haulldn ) mat , the luncheonette , the liquor store  --  interior spaces " ) Michals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures meant to suggest a story or the experience of one moment . The moments reflected in Duane Michals ' sequences are sometimes unusual ( one sequence ends with the burning of a woman 's shoe in the East Twenties ) , and sometimes they are recognizably ordinal. ) , but they are alwa ) s touched by something Surreal , and they have about them the feeling of something old that has been rediscovered but not quite understood . Mr. Michals ' sequences have been exhibited successfully in a show at the Museum of Modern Art , entitled " Stories , " and are now in a hook , entitled " Sequences . " We recently met Mr. Michals , a small man with a young smile , in his house , on East Nineteenth Street , as he was about to begin photographing part of a new sequence , which , he says , will he his most ambitious one . He introduced us to his model , a painter called Danny Mama , and led us into his front room f he has no studio I , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , old , elaborately carved grand piano . Mr. Michals did some minor preparation of the lights . " This is my epic , " he said . " It is The journey of the Spirit After Death , ' and it is based loosely on the Tibetan Book of the Dead . There will he about twelve parts . The most I 've ever had before was nine , for a sequence called ' The Illusions of the Photographer . ' I began to do sequences about four y cars ago . After I did empty rooms for a while , they began to look like stage sets to me , and I felt that I wanted to interject my self more into the picture . I have never wanted to he a re-porter or an observer . And , at the time I began , a number of things in my personal life were making me more introspective . I often deal with the subject of death , which intrigues me enormously . Death is unphotographahlc . I do n't mean the fact of death there are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of death and its metaphysical implications . ' The Journey of the Spirit After Death ' deals with the idea of death . Until now , the sequences have had the continuity of one event in one place  --  what happens in one instant , reflected in a visual haiku . In this sequence , Danny , the spirit , will he the only continuity . It starts out with his dying  --  I have n't decided whether it 's a mugging or an accident . Then , using a douhle exposure , I 'll show Danny 's spirit rising from the dead body . Then there is the shot we will he shooting now  --  Cosmic Consciousness , The Void , the spirit 's first experience , according to the Book of the Dead . This should 28 JANUARY 1 1 9 7 1 he pure light . Everything will he almost completely bleached out . The rest of the sequence will he like this : The spirit 's mind becomes manifest and hallucinates , and Danny experiences the contents of his mind  --  I will use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Danny . Then the spirit visits the bereaved . It will he hard to find the right room for that . I 'll need just the right amount of tacky furniture . My grandmother 's house , in Pennsylvania , would he perfect . I wish she lived in Brooklyn . Then there is a picture of a pregnant woman , with Danny 's spirit beside her . Then , at last , a man and wife with a child . The two last pictures will suggest reincarnation . According to the Book of the Dead , if the spirit recognizes Cos-ink Consciousness and union with the Universe , then the spirit enters Nirvana , but that seldom happens , so the cycle continues . " Mr. Michals began to shoot the Cosmic Consciousness section of " The Journey- of the Spirit After Death . " Mr. Maffia , his shirt off , sat across from him at a black Formica-topped table , making a small gesture with two fingers that had been suggested to Mr. Michals by a painting by Odilon Redon . " That 's beautiful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoulders there ? " asked Mr. Maffia . " Yeah , I do n't mind the shoulders , " said Mr. Michals . " Do n't forget , the whole idea is you 're supposed to he in ecstasy . " A roll of film was finished . " How did they look ? Not too corny ? " asked Mr. Mafha . " Sure , they look a little corny , but ? it should he that way , " Mr. Michals said . " How can you show ecstasy ? " No Rush AMAN we know who was out of the city over the New Year 's weekend returned to find that his apartment had been ransacked . Not wanting to use the police emergency number911 ? in a post-factum situation , he dialled Directory Assistance to ask for the number of the local police station . There was a pause , and then Directory Assistance asked politely , " The what , sir ? " " The number of the police , " our friend said patiently . There was another pause , after which Directory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Fellows IN the fall of 1968 , at the suggestion of two Yale undergraduates , Assistant City Administrator Sigmund G. Ginsburg drew up a program to tram college students  --  both male and female , and both undergraduate and graduate  --  in city government here in New York . Each student would work from September to June , as part of a class of twenty , and would receive a stipend of thirty-five hundred dollars from the city and , from his college , at least five hundred dollars and a waiver of tuition , plus academic credit for the time spent away from his classrooms . The plan went into effect in September of the following year ; a second group of Urban Fellows , as they arc known , started work last fall ; and the city now has recruiters on four hun deed and two campuses looking for twenty more Fellows . The other day , we dropped in on Mr. Ginsburg at his office , which is on the four-teenth floor of 250 Broadway , across the street from City Hall , to ask how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful than even I thought it would be , and I 'm the one who drew up the prospectus , " he said . " The Fellows have picked up nine months of practical experience dint no university could provide , and the city has received work that would probably have cost it three times the amount of the stipends that the Fellows get . In addition , we have henefitted immeasurably from the fresh perspectives that these young men and women have given us . " Seed money fur the first Fellowships was donated by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , but in September the city will assume the full cost of the program , which comes to a hundred thousand dollars a year . " We told the Sloan people that we believed the Fellowships would demonstrate their value to the city , and they have , " Ginsburg went on . " Mayor Lindsay is particularly enthusiastic about them . There may have been lots of students who were better qualified than those who were selected , but the point is that they did n't apply for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas  --  we simply select the best-qualified of those who apply . The first year , there were a hundred applications , and four of the successful candidates were from campuses here in the city ; this year , we interviewed a hundred and thirty-eight applicants , and none of those chosen came from city campuses . IV c are stepping up our recruiting program , though , both at the local colleges and at colleges out of town . " In addition to carrying on their scheduled work , the Fellows meet one evening a week in the office of Deputy Mayor Timothy IV . Costello for off-the-record seminars with speakers both in and out of government . Last year 's class of Fellows met with Deputy , Mayors Costello and Richard R. Aurelio ; Mitchell I. Ginsberg , then the Human Resources Administrator ; Victor Gotbaum , executive director of the citv 's chapter of the American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees ; the defense analyst and physicist Herman Kahn ; and McGeorge Bundy , the president of the F'ord . Foundation . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Wagner ; Jimmy Breslin , the writer ; and Martin Tolehin , who is a political reporter for the Time. : and the chief of its City Hall bureau . We crossed the street and made our way through the City Hall rotunda to the Mayor 's press office , where we found one of the present Fellows  --  the Reverend Mark Corrigan , a Roman Catholic priest , who was in mufti and had long sideburns . Father Corrigan ( " Nobody calls me Father around here ; in the office it 's just Mark " ) was drafting the text of a television address in which Deputy Mayor Aurelio was to publicize the fact that elderly tenants of rent-controlled apartments were exempt from recent rent increases . " What I 'm trying to do is develop an expression of my ministry , " he said . " I 'm trying to find new ways in which the Church can express herself within the political structure . I think my contribution to the press office comes in reestablishing a relationship between the political structure and the academic world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father Corrigan told us that he is currently enrolled in a doctoral program in education at Boston College , and that he hopes eventually to obtain an urban ministry , either in the Boston archdiocese , to which he is now assigned , or in New York City . " I wanted the Fellowship in order to attain an overview of the political structure of the city , and while I 've got that , all right , I 've also been learning that this city government amounts to so much more than the top people , " he said . " A real team concept comes through . " In the office of City Labor Relations Director Herbert L. Haber , on the twenty-seventh floor of 2511 Broadway , we were introduced to Esta R. Bigler , a recent graduate of Cornell Universitv 's School of Industrial and Labor Relations , who at that moment was compiling wage-and-benefit figures on the salaries of the interncs and the resident doctors employed by the city 's Health and Hospitals Corporation . " I 'm really an assistant to Mr. Haber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us . " Right now , I 'm trying to calculate what effect the interns ' and residents ' salary proposals would have on the corporation 's budget -- how much each offer would cost in dollars , and so forth . I 'm also working on a wage survey , finding out what physicians receive from private clinics . " Miss Bigler , who plans to return to Cornell in the fall and then go on to law school , said that she had studied the principles of collective bargaining in college , but her training up to now had been completely academic . " For the first time in my life , I 'm getting a chance to see how everything meshes , " she went on . " I never attended a collective-bargaining session before I came here , and now that I 've attended several , I 'm learning how , through subtle cues , hard negotiations progress until the parties concerned reach the area where thet ' re talking about the same things . " Paul E. Turner , who is completing his work for a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told us he is developing a grasp of the fundamentals of another kind of bargaining as a program-evaluation administrator for Edward Barker , who heads the program-evaluation staff of the Human Resources Administration . " I 'm doing research in contract compliance in the Council Against Poverty programs , " he told us when we stopped in at his office , at 220 Church Street . " What that means is that I 'm trying to find a way for the city to insure that the agencies receiving anti-poverty funds comply with the provisions of the government contracts and still do not usurp the rights of the people . " Mr. Ginsburg , when we got hack to his office , stressed the value of what the city has been able to learn from its student Fellows . " Because we have made it clear that we do n't want people who are . looking for jobs with the city , we have left the Fellows free to tell us what they really think , both on their jobs and at the seminars , " he said . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with this two-way kind of educational experience , and we certainly were . " We asked whether all of last year 's Fellows had returned to the campus . " Well , most did , including what I guess you might call our famous graduate- , Leon Botsrein , who as a Fellow was executive assistant to Joseph Mon-Se rrat , the president of the Interim Board of Education at that time , " Mr. Ginsburg said . " Monserrat was so impressed with him that he asked him to resign his Fellowship and become his deputy , at sixteen thousand dollars a year , but Burstein chose to stay in the program , and after he finished it he became , at the age of twenty-three , the youngest college president in the country  --  of Franconia College , in New Hampshire . " Several of the original Fellows , however , altered their educational plans to take regular jobs with the city , Mr. Ginsburg continued , and he told us what had become of them . " Lynda Brodsky , who was a Fellow in the Environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Administration , " he said . " Gwen Evans , who spent her Fellowship working at WNYC , the municipal broadcasting station , stayed on there in a career position . David Specht , a teacher-trainer in the Addiction Services Agency , accepted a career appointment with the Agency . Rhea Margulies , who worked in City Hall , in the Mayor 's office , is now a program-research assistant in the Health Department . " The graduate whose career Mr. Ginsburg has followed most close-y is John Berenyi , who is now a special assistant to E. S. Savas , the First Deputy City Administrator . During his year as a Fellow , Mr. Berenyi , a graduate of Columbia University , coordinated the surveys that led to the establishment of a city-wide Parking Violations Bureau . In addition , he and several other Fellows and a few city employees put together , in their spare time , a book that recounts their experiences in municipal service and urban living . " It 's called ' Up Against New York , ' and William Morrow is bringing it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us to another wing of 250 Broadway , where we found Mr. Berenyi , a modishly dressed young man . Mr. Berenyi told us that he and his parents fled from Hungary after the 1956 uprising and settled in Forest Hills in 1959 . As a student of urban systems , he had evaluated New York 's traffic-court services and found , he said , that , on the average , forty weeks elapsed between the time a violator was given a summons and the time he gut into court with it , and then he had to wait anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours for a twelve-second hearing before a judge . " With the new Parking Violations Bureau , we 've speeded up the whole operation , " he said . Currently , he is coiirdinating studies for the Mayor 's Inter-Agency Committee on Automotive Pollution , and he hopes to come up with a major traffic program for the city .

" Prugh 's Computer WORD recently readied us that a man named Thomas Prugh , who lives in Silver Spring , Maryland , had bought himself a computer and was teaching it to perform a variety of household chores . Since all the other computers of our acquaintance are gainfully employed in business enterprises of one sort or another , we called Mr. P nigh and made arrangements to visit him and his domestic computer , Mr. Prugh proved to he a Defense Department engineer , with a predilection for technical jargon , who lives in a suburban ranch-style house . His computer , which consists of a **34;3877;TOOLONG box and a teletype machine , is a two-year-old Digital Equipment Corporation Model PDP 8-L , and it resides in his den . " I 've always been fascinated by computers , " Mr. Prugh told us . " I acquired this one in January , 1969 , for eighty-five hundred dollars . I suppose other people would have bought a sports car or a pleasure boat instead . It 's one of a whole new species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communications industry and the machine-tool industry have found them to be useful components of larger systems . I got to wondering what a component like that could do in the home . " The computer came with a number of software programs prepared by the manufacturer . Mr. Prugh found a couple of them of interest to the householder . With one program , whereby he transmogrified the computer into a calculator , he prepared his 1969 income-tax return . Another program , called " text editing , " has helped him with an occasional business letter and has helped his daughter Amy , fifteen , with her English papers . Amy types up a rough draft of the paper on the teletype machine , types in whatever corrections she wants to make , and presses a button , and out conies a clean typed copy of the corrected paper . The first thing Mr. Prugh taught the computer on his own was how to tell time , which involved building a little hardware for an extra connection to the power line . Once the computer knew what time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out messages at given hours of the day . Mr. Prugh has also programmed his computer in what he describes as business functions ( it keeps track of his checking-account balance ) , secretarial functions ( it knows the phone numbers of his ? friends ) , and entertainment functions ( he has played a game with it , in which the computer tested his ability to add two-digit numbers , and he can make the teletype keys act like organ keys and produce musical tones ) , but what really interests him is a fourth category of functions  --  one he calls " baby-sitting the house and its occupants . " - rust then , Mrs. Prugh , who had been out visiting a friend , drove up in her car and obligingly demonstrated Category 4 . When she opened the garage door , which Mr. Prugh had connected to the computer by sensors , PDP printed out a terse bulletin : " GDO " t garage door open ) . Several minutes later , it issued another brief statement : " GDC " ( garage door closed ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five minutes , the computer would have instructed it to close , " Mr. Prugh said . " My goal is to make the computer the . silent sentinel around the house . I have it in mind to connect it to the windows , the furnace , and the basement floor . It will he able to give off alarm signals if the windows are opened unexpectedly , or the furnace overheats , or the basement floods . I 'm limited by the amount of spare time I have to work out each program and by the computer 's capacity , which is only four thousand words . A simple message like ' Wake up ' uses thirty to forty words . Another limitation is money . Let 's say the computer finds a window open and rings some bells but no one is at home to hear them . You 'd want it to be able to telephone the police automatically . But ' Ire decided , for now , not to get involved in the financial and legal transactions I 'd have to have with the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the phone and have it place calls or answer the phone when was away and dialled it to get a status report on the house . " Mr. Prugh is quick to admit that a number of relatively inexpensive gadgets  --  a clock , a calculator , a player piano , a text-editing typewriter , a burglar-alarm system , and so on  --  can , separately , perform many of the tasks his computer has learned , and also that his computer is " not what we at the Defense Department call cost-effective . " However , he admires the computer 's versatility ( " No clock can cope with my income taxes " ) , and he believes that a home computer will be economically feasible in the not very distant future . " In the two years since I purchased my computer , the price for a slightly more capacious model has dropped to sixty-five hundred dollars , " Mr. Prugh told us. " ' f he trend in the computer business is for prices to continue to fall , My guess is that by 1975 you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . And it would he simpler if , instead of trying to add a computer to an already built house , you sat down with an architect and planned how you 'd build in the sensors in a new house . The home computer could he programmed to plan menus , to keep track of the children 's dentist appointments , and to keep a running grocery list . Once the grocery list was compiled , the computer could tell you the shortest possible route through the aisles of your supermarket to make your purchases . Computers are already monitoring patients in hospitals . What the home computer will do someday will simply depend on the ingenuity of the person who is dealing with it . " ?
