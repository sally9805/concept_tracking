THE CONGRESSMAN IS READY to tie his shoelaces , having waited , as he does every morning , until he has stepped on the escalator that rises out of the bowels of the Longworth House Office Building , where he has parked his car , and is ascending to the basement , where he can take an elevator to his office on the second floor . The Congressman ties his shoelaces with a certain grace and style , the idea being that before he gets on the escalator going up , he will glance at the escalator coming down , and see if there is anyone on it he knows , The Congressman is an affable man , which is one reason he is a successful politician , and he knows a good many people in and about the House of Representatives , which is one reason he is a sound Congressman , and if he bends too quickly to tie his shoelaces while he is on the up escalator , he might pass without seeing someone on the down escalator to whom he might want to nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives ; and while this ran he one man 's bullshit , it is another man 's good manners , and without it the Congressmen might fly at one an-other 's throats and never get around to doing any business at all . On this particular morning the Congressman , an intensely disorganized man who can get on the escalator with a pair of socks or Jockey shorts in one hand because he has forgotten to pack them in the overnight bag he is carrying in the other hand , is completely unencumbered , and so with both hands free , and after saying hello to a Congressman who was on the down escalator , he bends , ties his shoelaces , and straightens himself up at that precise moment he reaches the top . " There , " he says , " 1 used six seconds that I might have wasted . " Now , this is whimsy , a ritual observed by the Congressman only because he enjoys observing it , and on this particular morning there is hardly any need to save time at all . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a new House , with fifty-six new members , will convene in less than a month . In fact , the Congress , having been sluggish in its duties in the past year , is meeting now mostly so that it can pass appropriations bills that will keep the great creaking machinery of government from going flat broke , and there is not much of a sense of urgency about even that . The Congressman , whose name is Guy Vander Jagt , and who is a thirty-nine-year-old Republican from the Ninth District in Michigan , will spend his day not being caught by the great questions of war and peace , but by things that few people outside his office have even heard of , which , as any Congressman will tell you , are the things that usually engage Congressmen anyway . A Congressman , you understand , is seldom allowed to be apocalyptic , which is a privilege ordinarily extended only to writers , ideologists , and a few show-business personalities ; and although the messianic complex is rampant in the House of Representatives , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Congressman does not . Consequently , on this quiet day in the House , when , among other things , seven hills and two resolutions will be introduced , when thirteen bills will be reported , a dozen committees will meet , and an uncounted number of Congressmen will either fall flat on their faces or run up some small and modest triumphs , Congressman Vander Jagt , recognizing it all as a slow day , will not hurry to his office , but will tarry , saying hello to as many people as he chooses , and move through the Longworth Housc Office Building with the sure tread of a man whc is absolutely delighted to be precisely where he is V ANDER JAGT WAS MADE TO HOLD OFFICE , beim an old farm boy from Cadillac , Michigan wh ( was graduated from Yale Divinity School , then lef a pulpit to become a television news commentator and then left that to go through law school and become a trial lawyer . In 1965 he ran for the State Senate , first telling the voters that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be only a servant of the people . He did win , and subsequently the members of the press gallery chose him as the outstanding freshman in the State Senate . When Senator Patrick McNamara died in 1966 , Congressman Robert P. Griffin was selected to fill the vacancy , leaving open his own seat in the Ninth District , and Vander Jagt chose to run for that . The district , made up of eleven counties on the western shore of Michigan , begins about a third of the way up the coast of the lower part of the state and stretches into the Straits of Mackinac , which is close to the wonderfully desolate Upper Peninsula of Michigan . The nice thing about Michigan is that while politically it is thought of as being mostly Detroit and a few outlying communities , it includes virtually every class and condition of American , and Vander Jagt 's own district , which is mostly rural and Republican , includes a county that is mostly urban and Democratic . Despite that county , which he carries anyway , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been Republican primaries , the first when he ran for the State Senate , and the second when he ran for Griffin 's seat . In that second primary , his opponent 's people distributed a particularly scurrilous broadside which charged , among other things , that Vander Jagt had been in and out of mental institutions and that his wife had had some unknown number of husbands before she met him . In fact , Vander Jagt had never suffered an emotional ailment and his wife had never been married before , and other than introducing Vander Jagt to the particular ugliness that gets entwined in the political process , the broadside induced a good many Republicans to vote for him . The Michigan Ninth has large number of what are sometimes called burghers , who do not much care for dirty pool , and he things that get to them the most are the things : hat can either be dismissed as home-and ? motheraood stuff or be recognized as the serious concerns serious people , which as often as not is what ley are . Possibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southernmost county in Vander Jagt 's district , where a man must search ong and hard to find a fifth of Scotch , and where most of the people , like Vander Jagt , are of Dutch iescent . Vander Jagt , in fact , won his first campaign in ) ttawa County , getting elected president of the stulent body at Hope College in the town of Holland , when a particularly astute campaign manager used he slogan " Fly High With Guy , " and insisted that he candidate appear before him each morning fully nd suitably clothed , Vander Jagt even then having n unusual tendency to look as if he had stood in he middle of a room and his clothes had dropped n him at random . At Hope , Vander Jagt also won early every speech contest that was open to a allege student , which was interpreted as a sign iat he could later make it in any of the entertainment arts , all of which he more or less did , while finding only politics sustaining enough to stay with . Vander Jagt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and he regarded Richard as a more interesting man than his brother Reinhold . Later , he left the pulpit of his Congregational church in Cadillac because he could find nothing suitable to preach about death . He left television because that was just another branch of show business , and he went through the University of Michigan Law School mostly out of perversity . A dean had called him in on his arrival and said that Michigan was the finest and toughest law school about and that it was impossible to get through without the utmost devotion to law books and classes . The hell , Vander Jagt had said , and subsequently made it a point not to open too many books , and not to be particularly diligent about classes either . Philip A. Hart , the senior Senator from Michigan , is supposed to have gone through Michigan Law School w ithout opening any books . He was graduated No. 1 in his class ; Vander Jagt , however , only made it into the top quarter . ) When Vander Jagt left law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest and most prosperous law firm in Western Michigan , and he was doing just fine , until one night , answering his own secret urgings , he summoned his wife Carol and announced that he wanted to go into politics . He did , running that first race for the State Senate , and being fortunate enough to have as his Democratic opponent a civilized doctor with money , who said to him , 1 have means , and you have none ; I shall not try to outspend you , but we will debate together , and try the campaign on the issues . This they did , arriving separately with their wives at the schools , Legion halls , and churches of Western Michigan , there to talk about issues and call each other skunks and blackguards , and then to steal away separately and unite for a drink in some place where they would not be recognized . The doctor is still the most formidable opponent Vander Jagt has faced in a general election , and the Democratic party in the Michigan Ninth is a frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , possessed of an enormous voice , an old Phi Beta Kappa key that he jangled a lot , and a firm conviction that the only thing worth talking about was the peril of extending aid to parochial schools . Another time he faced an apple farmer , who began each of his speeches by saying , " Hip , hip , hooray for America , " and never got much beyond that ; and in this last election he was up against a union official , who hardly said anything at all . Nonetheless , Vander Jagt has remained an assiduous campaigner . In 1970 , he returned to his district forty-nine times , speaking whenever he could get even two or three to gather in his name , and faithfully listening , nodding , and trying to accede to each request from a constituent , no matter how loony . In the spring of the year , Carol Vander Jagt organized a " Fry for Guy , " which was a bratwurst roast in the sand dunes alongside Lake Michigan , charged admission at $100 a couple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no other money , although the Democratic organization in the Ninth , which is really labor and its Committee on Political Education ( COPE ) , had more , and it was able to use unions , their members and halls , and their mimeograph machines too . This made the Ninth one of the few districts in the country where the Democrats spent more than the Republicans , although any Congressman from the Ninth would still cherish an endorsement from the conservative Americans for Constitutional Action infinitely more than he would one from the AFL-CIO . Vander Jagt , in fact , had even asked Americans for Constitutional Action for an endorsement , and throughout the campaign he carried a copy of their telegram in his back pocket . ready to whip it out at first sight of an outraged conservative . Vander Jagt had voted for the rat-control bill , and he had voted against the supersonic transport . He had voted for the House version of the Cooper-Church resolution , which would have required the withdrawal of American troops from Cambodia , and in his finest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote against a military appropriations bill . Still , a defeat was inconceivable , and he knew it , and the Democrats knew it , and so did everyone else . COPE 's campaign had not been particularly good , and there were defections in its ranks . One night Vander Jagt debated a union leader who stood up and said , " Well , 1 want you to know that Vander Jagt is my friend and I like him . In fact , I ca n't think of much bad to say about him . In fact , I ca n't think of anything bad to say at all . " Then he sat down . Still , politicians ' hopes are the most fragile of things , and politicians plunge easily into despair . On election night , the first return was from a Democratic precinct in the Democratic city of Muskegon ; " 214 for Rogers , 115 for Vander Jagt , " a voice on the phone said . " Do n't tell Guy . It will only worry him , " Mrs. Vander Jagt said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked stricken too . When it was all over , however , he had won with 67 per cent of the vote , and he had even carried Muskegon easily . The next morning Vander Jagt was outside the gates of a factory , awaiting the men as they came to work , and then thanking them for their support . S O , ON THIS SLOW DAY IN THE HOUSE , Vander Jagt enters the office on the second floor into which he and his staff lately have moved from an office cn the first floor . The new office is next to the one occupied by John Buchanan of Alabama . and Buchanan is supposed to have the best-looking secretaries on the Hill , one of whom had reached an ephemeral kind of fame by being dropped from the staff of Senator Joseph Tydings after she had worked as a bunny in a Playboy club . Now . marhismo is important to Congressmen , being one of the things they use to unite themselves when politics divides them , and a Congressman is only paying another Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of machismo . For days after he had moved in next to Buchanan , Vander Jagt was visited by Congressmen who would say . " Guy , you old rascal , how did you ever manage to get this office ? " All of this upset Vander Jagt 's own girls , who are good-looking themselves , and Vander Jagt , trying to do the right thing , told them that they probably were more efficient than Buchanan 's girls , which did no good at all . A Congressman 's staff is enormously important to him , handling his requests from constituents and other supplicants , and more or less seeing to it that the Congressman does not disappear under a welter of trivia . Among his other allowances , a Congressman is permitted to hire up to thirteen people , and to pay them a total of $135,000 . Vander Jagt has four secretaries and an administrative assistant working for him in Washington , and one full-time man and three part-time people in his district . Every so often , he gels in other people for specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is planning to hire a former professor of political science , who will be something of an idea man . The Congressional bureaucracy measures and operates itself under rules that no one man can ever know , or for that matter ever want to know . A Congressman , for example , is allowed to get a new steamer trunk at the start of each session of Congress and one plant a month from the Botanical Gardens . He is allowed to spend up to $3,500 a year for sta. tionery , but if he takes the money and puts it in his pocket , it is to be considered income . The long distance calls from his office are measured by units , with one minute on the phone being four units . and the office may use up to 150.000 units every two years . However , if the calls are made after 5:00 P.m. or before 9:00 a , a4. on something called the Federal Telecommunications System , they are free . Salaries for staff people arc figured on a has ( pay , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant may be only $7,500 , his actual salary may be $27,000 . A Congressman is allowed one free trip home every month , while members of his staff are allowed two a year . When Vander Jag first reached the House , he had to supply his owr curtains and wastebaskets . Subsequently , tin bureaucracy shuddered into action , and now gnomes from somewhere bring them in for free " Guy , these are the calls so far , " Peg Mardi says to Vander Jagt . Mrs. Martin is the doyenre of the staff , a pretty woman with gray hair win reached the Hill in 1939 , became enchanted by it and never left . She is a discreet woman , married t , a lobbyist for the oil industry , and one way or an other she may know everyone in government . Whel her husband gave a party for her on her thirtiet : anniversary in Congress , even Wilbur Mills , chair man of the Ways and Means Committee , came t celebrate , and Mills is a man with such small us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to dinner at the Whit House . Now Mrs. Martin gives Vander Jagt hi messages , arranging them so that the first he sec is one from Russell Train , the President 's advise on environmental problems . Vander , Jagt calls Train , listens , and says , " Russell , that 's just wonderful . I 'm absolutely delighted , and thank you , thank you , for calling . " Vander Jagt , you see , is the ranking Republican on the Conservation and Natural Resources Subcommittee , and about six months ago . the subcommittee went to the While House environmental people and discussed with them an old law that forbade industry from befouling interstate waters . The law , in fact , had been passed in 1899 , but , like so many things in gov ? . rnment. had lain moldering until good men would put their hands to it . Henry Reuss , a Democrat , who is the chairman of the subcumminee , brought the aw up in hearings , wrote letters about it , and then . tent around and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore closer to he White House , kept talking to the people there , end two weeks ago he got to Train at a cocktail mrty and insisted to him that the 1899 law should ndeed be resurrected . Now Train had called to tell rim that the Administration would soon issue an ; : , executive Order , declaring that the old law was official policy and that enforcement machinery for it would be set up . There is nothing simple about ; overnment , and in the end the 1899 law will inolve three or four agencies ( all of which will have heir own lobbyists ) , the Army Corps of Engineers , couple of Congressional committees , and the deli-ate considerations of partisan politics . Jobs will be reated , reputations will collapse , and some staff eople will weep with frustration . Government is ke that , and it is easier to he apocalyptic than to -y to understand it . So , feeling well pleased by Train 's call , and after aving disposed of some matters of no consequence , ander Jagt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep in the recesses of the Rayburn Buildig. is unmarked , and it is open only to Congress . ten , who , in fact , do a good deal of business there . is where they can he good fellows together and here even the least of the Congressmen can ap . roach a committee chairman , naked and alone in le steam room , and ask for a favorable ruling on is bill . Some Congressmen spend more time in the em than do others , and the Republican minority the Public Works Committee , for example , meets ' ere in a more or less permanent caucus . Vander egt himself is the president of the gym , which he Tame when the other Congressmen voted him the allshot of the Year Award . This is an engraved ip that ostensibly is given to the Congressman who ' eats the most at a game called paddle ball , and gues more over questionable line calls ; actually , is given as a mark of esteem , and Vander Jagt tasures it . The only duty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual dinner , which s been held in eighteen different places in twenty ars , few establishments being willing to have the ongressmen as guests more than once . At some int in the dinners , Congressmen begin to soak sir napkins in their water glasses , and then hurl ! ni at other Congressmen . The hilarity increases : e.r that , and otherwise dignified men get them selves sodden and bespotted , although the Great Republic itself always survives . Nonetheless , there is a majesty about the House , even if it is not always apparent in its members . It must always be remembered that the curious ways of politics in the House , unlike the Senate , do not allow for much majesty , which is why Congressmen are infinitely more interesting and proportionately more productive than Senators , who must strike postures a lot . In the House , it is sweatier , so to speak , and more intimate , and there is more room for caprice . Vander Jagt 's chief and abiding interest , for example , has been the environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park , a tract of 61,000 acres on the shore of Lake Michigan . For years , Phil Hart had been introducing a Sleeping Bear bill in the Senate , and for years the Senate had been passing it . In the House , however , the bill never got beyond the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee , whose chairman , Wayne Aspinall of Colorado , always declined to report it unless the full Michigan delegation . Republicans and Democrats , would support it . This the delegation always declined to do , and Sleeping Bear would always die . Shortly after the ' 68 elections , however , Vander Jagt began to negotiate with the Secretary of the Interior and with the Park Service over a new Sleeping Bear bill , one that might please everyone , and after ten months of negotiation he produced it , staying all the time in touch with Hart , who was still laboring for Sleeping Bear in the Senate . This annoyed James O'Hara , a Democrat , who was Hart 's closest colleague in the Michigan Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and not with Vander Jagt , who was , after all , a Republican . Consequently , O'Hara said , he would have nothing to do with Vander Jagt 's bill , which meant , of course , that Aspinall would then reject it because the Michigan delegation would be divided . Subsequently , a lobbyist for the Wilderness Society got to O'Hara and suggested that he introduce his own bill , which the Michigan Democrats could sign , while the Michigan Republicans could go with Vander Jagt . O'Hara did , confusing nearly everyone , and inducing John Dingell , another Democrat , to say the hell with it and sign both bills . Meanwhile , the Interior Depart . ment , which had been working with Vander Jagt on his bill , suddenly and inexplicably said that it liked O'Hara 's better . This enraged Vander Jagt , who , on demanding an explanation , was told that the man in the Interior Department who knew all about Sleeping Bear was on vacation and that someone had made a mistake . The department then reversed itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the Vander Jag bill , even though O'Hara 's name was still on it . Chairman Aspinall , however , said that a bill amended that much was a mess , and he demanded that the Michigan delegation produce a clean bill . Of course , he said , it would still have to be supported by the full delegation . During all these peregrinations , Martha Griffiths of Detroit , a Democrat , had been lobbying for her own bill on women 's rights , which was stuck off in another committee . Mrs. Griffiths wanted everyone to sign a discharge petition to force the committee to release the bill , but O'Hara , very sensibly saying that it was a bad bill , would not sign . This so angered Mrs. Griffiths that she said she would not support the Sleeping Bear bill . But , Martha , Vander Jagt said , that 's my hill . I know , Mrs. Griffiths said , but that man 's name is on it . But , Martha , Vander Jagt said . No , Mrs. Griffiths said . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she did , telling him that she really did like the bill , but that she simply would not sign anything that said O'Hara on top . Aspinall , who is seventy-four , rather liked the idea of Mrs. Griffiths coming to him that way , and so he said that his committee would report the bill out , even without her signature . Faithfully , the committee did report the bill , sending it to the Rules Committee . which was to decide when it would be sent to the House floor , where its passage would be assured . There was , of course , no reason to think the Rides Committee would delay the bill , which had been the fruit of so much labor and passion , but in the mysterious ways of Congress it did , and once again Sleeping Bear was languishing . Baffled , Vander Jagt approached various members of the Rules Committee , asking them why , and was told that " Charlotte did n't like the bill , " although no one knew quite why . Now , Charlotte is Congresswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Rules Committee , but she is a sunny woman , much admired and liked , who was once the vocalist on Don McNeill 's old Breakfast Club radio program . The members of the Rules Committee could not possibly know much about Sleeping Bear , but they did know Mrs. Reid , who has a summer cottage in the Sleeping Bear area , and they wanted to please her . Therefore , they were holding the bill back , and they kept holding it back until Mrs. Reid and Vander Jagt appeared formally to argue their cases . Then the committee locked its doors and voted in secret . When the doors were opened , it was announced that Sleeping Bear , finally , had triumphed . I T IS NOONTIME , AND VANDER JAGT is just sitting down in the House restaurant , and on the floor of the House the chaplain is praying over those few members who have gathered to open the day 's session . Three staff people from the White House happen by , and one of them glumly tells Vander Jagt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rules Committee . " Congressman Buchanan has sponsored a bill that would put a new consumer-protection agency more or less under the control of the White House , while a competing bill by a Democrat would make the agency more autonomous , which the staff people plainly do n't want . A buzzer sounds in the restaurant , and Vander Jagt frowns . The buzzer means that a quorum call has been put forth on the floor and that a clerk is about to read the roll . The Constitution says that Congress can not he in session unless a majority of its members are present , and so any Congressman at any time and for the most frivolous of reasons can ask the Speaker to check and make sure there b a majority . There are quorum calls because a Con gressman simply is feeling irritable , or because h ( wants to delay the day 's business , or because he ha : a friend who is making a speech and he wants tr roust the other Congressmen out to hear it . Then ( are quorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peers milling about him , and there are quorum calls because someone wants tr empty the paddle-ball courts in the gym and titer dash down and get the center court . ( For his own reasons . H. R. Gross of Iowa asks for more quorum calls than anyone else , and the other Republicans accepting H. R. , sometimes call him the " consciener of the House . " Mostly , however , H. R. is just being cranky . ) Consequently , Congressmen spend a goof part of their days walking rapidly along the under ground corridors that lead from their office build ings to the Capitol , where they run out on the House floor , shout " Present , " and then leave . 1 . is usually a great exercise in futility , and the Con gressmen resent it , but no one has been able tr think of a way to stop it . Quorum calls are part of man 's record , and they are just not very well under stood outside of Congress . A Congressman does no want his opponent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the roll was called that day and so he goes on making the quorum calls . " Ir politics , " Vander Jagt says , " if you even have tr answer a charge , then you 've already lost . " Vander Jagt waits until the buzzer rings a sec and time , which means that the clerk reading the roll is up to the letter Q. Vander Jagt has nicell ? calculated from all parts of the Hill exactly hoe much time it will take him to reach the floor after that second buzzer rings ; from the restaurant , al lowing for all vagaries , he knows that he can wai about two minutes , walk to an elevator , and ge there just as the clerk is ready to intone " Vande : Jagt . " Today this gives him time to swallow hi : soup , unnecessarily tell the waiter he will be back and start for the House floor in a dignified way Allard K. Lowenstein , the liberal New Yorker wh ( has just been defeated for reelection after one term wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ning . " Guy , " he says , " can you think of anythim more foolish than a lame-duck Congressman in lame-duck session trying to answer a quorum call ? ' Everyone knows Lowenstein , and for days now , con servatives who might be expected to want to crueif : a man of his proclivities have been coming up am saying how much they will miss him . Congress i a tough house to play to , but Lowenstein , who a much as any man had been responsible for Lyndce Johnson 's decision not to run again , was some thing of a celebrity when he arrived , and Congress men like to have celebrities about . Moreover , i terms of Congressional politics , Lowenstein wa an authentic radical , and conservatives always ar pleased when they meet someone they suppose to I a radical ? and then find he is a decent , pleasar man , Vor one thing , it makes a conservative Co good , convincing him that he can get along with any man ; for another , it makes him feel daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new boys , and if a new boy is supposed to have a special dimension about him , he is measured up all the more quickly . Ideologists do not come out well , but Lowenstein showed he was a genuine reformer , and certainly not just another liberal politician , and the old boys respected him for it . On Lowenstein 's first day in the House , the late L. Mendel Rivers accosted him and almost immediately began waving three fingers in his face . Ho , ho , the reporters in the gallery said . Rivers is telling Lowenstein not to try any fancy New York-Jewishliberal stuff here . Actually , Rivers was very courteously telling Lowenstein there were three synagogues in his district in South Carolina . T IS THE 190TH QUORUM CALL that Vander Jagt has ' answered this year , and he shouts " Present " and starts to move off the floor . Congressman Garry Brown stops him and says he needs his vote on an amendment he will offer in the afternoon . " I 'll he there , Garry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , " Guy , do n't go away . I 've been designated to seek your support for Sam Devine for chairman of the house Republican Conference . " Now , this is a move by the more conservative Republicans to put one of their own in a job held by John Anderson , who is a moderate . It is largely a ceremonial job , but most Congressmen are moderates , and both the right and left wings of Congress place great stress on ceremonial victories . " I 'm sorry , Don , " Vander Jagt says , " but John Anderson is a friend of mine . I 've been in his home , and he 's been in mine . " " Okay , Guy . I understand , " Clancy says , and almost certainly he does , friendship and personal loyalty being recognized in the House as things beyond ideology , and suffi:ient to justify nearly any position . So Clancy does lot try to persuade , and Vander Jagt returns to unch . He has made the round trip in four min-rtes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is a little bored , even though he is a man who loves the House . " Sometimes , " he says , " I ' eel as if I should be paying for the privilege of beng here . " Congressman Pete McCloskey stops by , xchanges pleasantries , and mentions something , bout the Government Operations Committee . A ew days before , in an interview with a reporter or the Los Angeles Times , McCloskey had said that t would be a good thing for everyone if Nixon were hallenged in some Presidential primaries in 1972. low . McCloskey has lean , tough good looks , and he residue of a national reputation left over from he time he beat Shirley Temple Black in a primary . Moreover , he is a liberal Republican . and he was ndorsed by the New York Times in the last election , rhich he then won with 78 per cent of the vote . In in interview he had not said that he would enter a rimary against Nixon , and in fact he had said that e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be young , nd to be a politician , is to have a sense of the possibility of all things , and it is also to think of all the other politicians who could get in your way . So , what is McCloskey really thinking ? Another reporter wanders up to him and Vander Jagt . " Congressman McCloskey , " he says , " have you had any trouble from the White House on that statement about Nixon ? " " I said it because I wanted to make some trouble , " McCloskey says , moving away , and looking leaner and tougher than ever . " It was a good answer to a bad question , " the reporter says to Vander Jagt , " except that it did n't mean anything . " Vander Jagt , who is young , and a politician , and gets mentioned himself when the Michigan Republicans count their candidates . looks speculative and says nothing at all . It is early afternoon , and Vander Jagt is alone in his inner office with Bud Nagelvoort , his administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a baby food manufacturer in Michigan before he joined Vander Jagt in Washington , speaks very softly and very cautiously . He is superb at details and mustering all the small pieces of information that go into legislation , and like many politicians . Vander Jagt is not . Nagelvoort and Mrs. Martin are the only ones in the office who will call Vander Jagt by his first name , the secretaries always saying " Congressman , " which is what Nagelvoort and Mrs. Martin do , too , when strangers are about . There is a deference shown to Congressmen , and one of the truly sad things in Washington is a Congressman who has just lost an election and must now forgo that deference forever . It is one reason so many of them never return to their districts , but linger on in Washington , wraiths around their old privileges . The police stop traffic on Independence Avenue so a Congressman can cross and walk to the Capitol , even if it is only for one of H. R. 's quorum calls , and they will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic tickets . The clerks at Washington National Airport will delay a flight for him , and the telephone company will put " The Honorable " after his name in the phone book . A Congressman can find someone to do something for him nearly any time , and while this may not corrupt him , it can easily confuse him . Politicians , like trial lawyers , want to he loved for themselves , but a politician can never be entirely sure that this is why he is loved , and so he has a harder time than most . of us . Like all great institutions , official Washington sorts out men by their positions , and the positions determine the esteem one man shows for another . There is nothing wrong with this , and the Sacred College of Cardinals does it too . In Washington , however , there are more positions to go around than there are in the College , and while the cardinals only get together once in a while , the Washington people keep seeing one another all the time . Since only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the others treat them , they are all greatly dependent on one another . Unhappily for a politician , however , he can not be sure whether he is treated the way he is because of himself or because of his position , and so he carries a burden that most of us do not . In his soul , it vexes him . Bud Nagelvoort , meanwhile , is shuffling pieces of paper . " Guy , " he says , " we have this . " It is a confrontation they have each day , Nagelvoort carrying in to Vander Jagt the most recent memos , proposals , requests , and stray pieces of information he thinks he should know about , and Vander Jagt , after considering each one , saying either yes , no , let me see it , or put it aside . This day there is a memo on the United States and Soviet space programs . Vander Jagt wants to see it . There is more information on the Administration plan to help the railroads . He hesitates , and Nagelvoort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers . It is put aside . Someone will propose a bill to increase the number of family doctors . Vander Jagt is interested . There is a statement by another Michigan Congressman . He is not interested . The Government Operations Committee will vote on something while he will he out of town . He will send a proxy . The committee is sponsoring a trip to Puerto Rico . He is interested . The offer expired last Sunday . Oh . There are clippings on the Hope College choir , new Republican officials in Michigan , and pollution in the Great Lakes , and there is a report on the Muskegon County sewage system . He is interested in all of them . There is a cable from a friend , a black artist , who is on a trip to Africa . He has just been invited for a showing in the Soviet Union . Should he go . Certainly . There are twenty-three pieces of paper , each one of considerable moment to someone or other , and if Vander Jagt stops to be thoughtful over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . His talent , however , is to extrapolate , and then to decide quickly , which a good politician ought to be able to do . On larger matters , of course , it is more difficult . When Vander Jagt voted against the supersonic transport , the White House was for it ; Gerry Ford , being the House minority leader , was for it too , although like any sensible leader he had said no more than , " Guy , we 'd like your support on this one . " Furthermore , a factory in Muskegon fabricated metal parts for the SST , and the Republican county chairman even worked there . What if the chairman were to lose a stock option , or even his job , if the SST were canceled ? It was the kind of question that can get to a Congressman and gnaw at him . Vander Jagt brooded , wavered , and still voted against the SST . Shortly afterward , he learned that the men who ran the factory had never cared for him anyway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tolerable to him , although he wished he had known about it before . Now , of all things that can sway a Republican Congressman , a Republican White House is probably the greatest . The White House , however , is not one man ; it is a warren , a separate culture , of assistants , special assistants , counselors , and all their deputies . Their roles are unclear , and their authority never exactly defined , but they can be the ultimate source of favors and dispensations . A Congressman , for example , is supposed to be something ofa public-relations man for his district , and Vander Jagt once worked his White House sources for five months to be allowed to present a pair of wooden shoes to President Nixon as a gift from the people of Holland , Michigan , who every year hold a Tulip Festival . ( Vander Jagt also decided to give the President a recording made by an orchestra at Interlochen , a summer music camp in his district . When he walked into Nixon 's office , the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " Mr. President , I 'd like to present you with this wooden record . " ) In 1969 ; on a trip home , Vander Jagt met with some ecologists , urban planners , and Muskegon County officials who were trying to establish a new kind of sewage system to take the sewage that was wasting Lake Michigan and divert it to fertilize barren land . It was a stunning plan , with implications for every city in the country , and it was being delayed by opposition in the state capital . When Vander Jagt returned to Washington , he met with the federal people involved , and then finally . and most importantly , with John Ehrlichman , Nixon 's assistant on domestic affairs . Ehrlichman is one of the better people in the White House ; his soul is not always torn by fear that his President might not be reelected , and he can consider an issue on its merits . Moreover , the Ehrlichmans are friends and neighbors of the Vander Jagts , and Ehrlichman 's daughter is their baby-sitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , much less that of a sewage system , has been decided . Vander Jagt and Nagelvoort talked to Ehrlichman for two hours about the Muskegon proposal , and shortly thereafter the whole federal bureaucracy became more interested in it . Nonetheless , the state government in Michigan still was not ready to accept it until Vander Jagt carried a letter from Nixon to Governor William Milliken at his summer home in Traverse City . The President told the Governor that he was personally interested in the sewage system , and although this was unlikely ? the sewage system being a highly complicated project , and Presidents generally not having the time to study such things ? it was ReaLpolitik . Sub . sequently , Milliken visited Muskegon , the state decided it supported the sewage system , and the federal government announced a $2 billion grant to get it started . Vander Jagt came out ahead too , when the League of Conservation Voters , which is interested in how of ecrive a politician is , named him as one of only seven Congressmen it was endorsing for reelection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forthcoming on the House floor , and Vander Jagt leaves his office , falling into step , as lie does , with his neighbor , Congressman John Buchanan . " John . " Vander Jagt says , " I talked to my man at the White House , and his reading is that they could n't get your bill out of the Rules Committee with cannons ? ' " That 's just not true , " Buchanan says . " and I got an even more optimistic report only an hour ago . " Vander Jagt speculates . This Administration has not distinguished itself when it has counted votes beforehand , and maybe it is wrong again . " Well , I hope you 're right , John , " Vander Jagt says . " I certainly hope so . " Vander Jagt crosses Independence Avenue ( the policeman stops traffic for him , of course ) and he sees coming toward him a Congressman he does not like , and who , for that matter , does not like him . They ignore each other as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost imperceptibly , they both nod . Vander Jagt keeps walking until he is in the shadow of the Capitol . " I 'll never be able to get along with that guy , " he says moodily . Vander Jagt quickens his pace , afraid he will miss the vote , and when he gets to the floor he enters on the Democratic , and not the Republican , side . The clerk reading the roll is up to Udall , and across the floor Vander Jaw sees the Republican doorkeeper , William Bon . sell , grinning , and then very gravely taking his index finger and poking himself in the eye with it . Vander Jagt stops and ponders . He is there to vote for a resolution that will limit the debate on a housing bill that afternoon to two hours . It is the 176th time this year he has appeared for a record vote , and he understands the resolution and knows how he will vote . Sometimes , however , dashing in from a committee meeting , or getting up from lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known what the hell he was supposed to be voting on . and even if he has known , he has not known how he wanted to vote . Bills tumble over one another in the House , and some of them are so complicated that only the staff , and perhaps a few Congressmen , ever know what is in them . There is no way that even the most conscientious Congress . men can sort them all out , but they are supposed to try , and so the Republicans , at least , will turn to Bonsell . " How are we going ? " Vander Jagt will say as he runs past him . " Well , " Bonsell will say , " Les and Gerry voted yes " ? Les being Leslie Arends , the Republican whip ? or " Everyone 's voting no , " Bonsell will say , sounding a little cavalier about it . So , there is Bonsell , still sticking his finger in one eye and looking at Vander Jagt with the other one , only now he is grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vander Jagt , " the clerk calls . " Aye , " Vander Jagt says . The afternoon is waning , and Vander Jagt is back in his office . A brigadier general from the Corps of Engineers , paying a courtesy call , was awaiting him when he returned from the House , and they exchanged pleasantries , the general saying that the Corps only took directions and did lot set policy , and Vander Jagt agreeing , saying hat of late the Corps had been doing a marvelous oh against pollution . Then the two Democratic ounsels to the Conservation and Natural Resources 3ubcommittee came by to talk about the 1899 law hat Russell Train had called about in the morning . rhe two counsels are capable men who work well vith Vander Jagt and Nagelvoort , but after they eft , neither Vander Jagt nor Nagelvoort were exctly sure why they had come . The two counsels , fter all , are Democrats , and they had been concerned about who would administer the 1899 law , and at bottom this is a political question . Vander Jagt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , and they did not talk about it after the two Democrats had left , but that was because of the convention that allows party politics to he present in all things in Washington , while at the same time never acknowledged . It is a sensible convention , and it allows men to work together when they might otherwise be inclined to argue . Now Vander Jagt is returning telephone calls . One is to a manufacturer in his district , who wants to object to an Administration plan for the Federal Aviation Agency . The second is to a Republican county chairman in Michigan , who wants his support on a candidate for the bench , and who finishes by saying , " Vander Jagt for Senator in ' 76 . " The third is from a friend , who wants a favor for his friend . The friend 's friend is a Democratic county chairman in Vander Jagt 's district , who has just discovered that he can not get a loan from the Federal Housing Administration for a home on a private road . The Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling a Republican Congressman about it , and so has asked someone else to do it . Vander Jagt , who knows that perhaps a third of the homes in the county are on private roads , agrees with the caller and says that he will check into it . Now , it happens that Vander Jagt plays paddle ball regularly with the chairman of the FHA , and after a game sometime he will talk to him about it . The chairman may or may not think that the law should be changed , but either way the Democratic county chairman will have his day in court . Vander Jagt says it is a perfect example of the way things get done in Washington . HE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS are scattered about I the floor of the House . They arc meeting in what is called the Committee of the Whole House , and they are about to consider the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 . In appearance , Congressmen are disparate , although they like to have their suits well pressed , and there is an uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like aging juvenile delinquents , and there are Congressmen who look like wheezing , belching rustics ( and who , in fact , turn out to be experts in the arcanum of the tax structure , say , or the tariff ) . Here there is a Congressman with a spiky Kaiser Wilhelm moustache , who quotes Shakespeare , and over there is a Congressman who won two Olympic gold medals , and a little further on is a Congressman who steals money . There arc Congressmen who can imagine themselves in no other place than the House , and there are Congressmen , a smaller number of them , who say the House makes their souls wither within them . Here is one , a younger man , exorcising his devils : " There are three kinds of Congressmen . First , there are the talented and gifted who will get out because they ca n't stand the system . Then there are the men with no talent , but they have a good job and so they stay . And then there are the men who are bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rayburn dictum still works ? if you want to get along , go along ? but the more docile you are the more resentful you become , and it becomes corro-sive . " There are Congressmen known by every man and woman in the House , and there are Congressmen so obscure they are known by hardly anyone . Their single devotions to the commonweal vary widely , and there are some easily indictable on the grounds of moral turpitude , but there is almost none who will break his word to another Congressman . That is considered the greatest of all sins , and the second greatest is to sell another Congressman on an absolutely lousy idea . Therefore , not everything produced by the House will have a great deal of merit , but very little will have no merit at all . It is a system that makes the House handle smaller issues better than it does larger ones ; and a dedicated , conscientious man can work his will on small things , while he can wreck himself fighting for large things . Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first got here I was shocked at the rudeness that committee members ' would show to Administration witnesses , and then gradually I became that way myself . Look , I checked , and there are only three computers in the House , and there are 3,700 in the Executive branch . You wait two hours so you can get a shot in at the Secretary of Defense , and then it lasts only five minutes . The only thing you know is that you 're getting bullshit from him , and there 's nothing you can do about it . My committee 's staff is loyal to the chairman , and the chairman will go along with the Secretary . It gets down to where you ask yourself , Should you even bother going to a meeting when you know you wo n't get anything from it ? " So , on this day , assembled to consider the housing act , are people of many temperaments and persuasions , most of them seriously involved in their own separate projects and few of them with deep knowledge of a housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what their colleagues will bring forth . It is a big and complex bill they are dealing with , and it has been drawn up by the Housing Subcommittee of the Banking and Currency Committee . That is , the original bill was drawn up by the subcommittee , but at the moment Congressman Robert Stephens is rising to offer what is called an amendment in the nature of a substitute , which is 132 pages long and which would replace the subcommittee 's bill , and he is doing it with the subcommittee 's approval . Now Congressman Charles Jonas stands , and asks if he can offer three amendments to the Stephens amendment , and he is told he can , but that he must wait . Congressman Frank Brasco , however , is on his feet , offering an amendment to the Stephens amendment , and it is accepted . Now Congressman Garry Brown is up , having waited so far for tactical purposes , and he proposes a substitute amendment for the Stephens amendment , which , remember , was a substitute for the subcom mittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises to offer an amendment to the Brown amendment , and then Stephens is up again to say that he thinks Congressman Blackburn is attaching his amendment to the wrong other amendment . Then Congressman Olin Teague is recognized so that he can propose his amendment to the Stephens amendment , and Congressman Blackburn is making a parliamentary inquiry : whatever happened to his amendment ? Congressman Robert Sikes then offers an amendment to the Brown amendment ; if that amendment loses , he says , he will propose it for the Stephens amendment . At this point there can be no more than a few members who clearly know what is happening , and things are not helped greatly when it is announced that " the question is on the substitute amendment , as amended , offered by the gentleman from Michigan for the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from Georgia . " It is a time for visceral instincts , and Vander Jagt knows only that , respecting Garry Brown as he does , he will vote for whatever it is he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , and he and Congressman William Barrett , who opposes his amendment , are appointed as tellers . They withdraw up an aisle , and the members who support Brown , the aye votes , start to pass by in single file . Brown taps himself on the chest , saying " One , " and then taps each Congressman on the back as he passes by : " two , three , four . " Barrett , as is the custom , is keeping his own count , and so they are standing there in the aisle , antagonists in a kind of numbers game , with the other Congressmen running by as markers . " Ninety-four , " Brown says finally , and then Barrett starts counting his no votes . He is up to ninety-six , and waiting , when five more Congressmen , found and summoned from Cod knows where , come running up the aisle , their arms outstretched , and point first to Barrett , and then to Brown , and then hack to Barrett again . " One hundred one , " Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is Brown , and so are two of the five Congressmen , who had wanted to be on Brown 's side . It does not matter , of course , because Brown would still have lost ; but he is a professional , and so his pride is a little touched . H OWEVER CONSIDERABLE HIS TALENTS , Vander Jagt is among the most forgetful of men , seldom wearing an overcoat , for example , because he knows he will leave it somewhere behind him , and often leaving home in the morning without his wallet , keys , or anything else that might persuade a police . man he is not a simple vagrant . Moreover , no matter how readily he may grasp a complicated piece of legislation , he is baffled by nearly any inanimate object , and by timetables and maps as well . Or . Election Day he was minutes getting into and ma of the voting booth because he was defeated by E lever , and when he was new in Washington he one ( had to call the police to guide him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less forgotten the way . Recognizing these things , his staff compensates for them , and now Vander Jagt is sitting at his desk while a secretary reads from a list . " Keys ? " she says , and Vander Jagt pats his pocket . " Tickets ? " she says , and he picks up the envelope in front of him . Vander Jagt is leaving town later in the evening so he can speak in Chicago the next day , and the secretary is leaving nothing to chance . A call is put through from his outer office , and Vander Jagt gets on the phone to talk to a friend at the White House . The Rules Committee has tied . 7 to 7 , on Buchanan 's bill for the new consumer-protection agency , and while this means the White House wo n't be able to get it now , it also means that it wo n't have to accept Democrat Rosenthal 's bill , and for this it is grateful . Vander Jagt is not scheduled to leave Washington until 8:00 P.tvt. , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , which means that he has time to go to a party . If Vander Jagt chose to , he could go to a party , or a reception , every night , a Congressman always being in demand for something , but he has long since learned that there is no profit in this , and so he exercises discretion . Tonight the National Space Club is holding a reception in the Caucus Room of the Cannon Office Building so that it can present trophies to Wernher von Braun and the widow of Dr. Robert H. Goddard , and as a member of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics , Vander Jagt has been asked to attend . The president of the Space Club is a man from Texas Instruments , and the first vice president is from Boeing , and the host for the evening is Congressman George P. Miller , chairman of the Committee on Science and Astronautics . It is a lobbying effort , and like most lobbying in Washington it is terribly en famille . ( Washington , in fact , is terribly en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees is Von Braun . " Wernher , " he says , " the last time I saw you , you were leading a conga line in New Orleans . " Von Braun smiles , acknowledges the memory , and then he is talking to someone about the stars , a fine flicker of fanaticism lighting his face , and Vander Jagt is plainly impressed . " Damn it , " he says , " I know it 's emotional , but I want to be exposed to the emotional part of it . " A lobbyist wanders by . and tells Vander Jagt that the word is that George Bush of Texas w ill be the next head of NASA . t Two days later , Bush is appointed Ambassador to the United Nations . J Bill Anders , who flew an Apollo spacecraft around the moon , falls into conversation , and he says that when he speaks to college students he emphasizes the spiritual part of his journey . " Guy , " ie says , " when 1 looked back at the earth , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the corner ) f the room , Von Braun is introducing his young on to Neil Armstrong , and Mrs. Goddard is talkng about her late husband , and a Texas Congressnan is hustling a secretary from NASA . Vander fagt is feeling warm and sustained , arid as he leaves o go to the airport he begins to talk about his vision if a federal medical academy . He has at the moment great sense of the possibility of all things .
