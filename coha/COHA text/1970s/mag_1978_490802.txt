THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONE of our favorite New York words is " Wad.jaback . " Not very many people ever hear it  --  they have to he in the right place at the right time ( and how many people are ever in the right place at the right time ) ? hut those , who manage to be hear it constantly . " Wadjaback " means " Watch your hack , " and it is shouted throughout the night by men who push handcarts at the Fulton Fish Market . It does n't mean that you should watch only your hack ; it applies equally to handcarts approaching from the front or either side . A handcart pusher coming right at you down an alley of haddock will look you in the eye and say " Wadjaback . " ( The danger from a fast-moving heavily loaded handcart is not to your back anyway  --  it 's to your ankles . The bottom of the cart has a metal platform that supports the cargo , and its leading edge is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind would probably take care of both Achilles tendons simultaneously , sending the victim briskly to the pavement and burying him under six boxes of iced flounder . ) But the reason we like " Wadjaback " is that it is rather personal and specific ( your hack ) , as opposed to the more common New York warning ( or threat ) " Watch it ! " ? which puts the priority on the " it " that is about to fall on you , strike you , or run over you , and whose implication is that your damn body may dent the fender of the Mack truck . In a city where people sometimes seem to be yelling at one all the time , the texture of a yell becomes significant . " Wadjahack " really means " Get the hell out of the way ' , " but it is too polite to say so . It acknowledges that you exist , that you have a back , and that you might wish to protect it . As warnings go , it 's solicitous . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hollow , exhausted , yet challenging imprecations " Have a nice day " and " Have a nice weekend . " There is no nonsense to " Wadjahack , " yet it combines concern , a recognition of one 's humanity and vulnerability , and good , solid advice . Wadjaback ! Playwright TT was in 1965 that we last had a chat with the playwright Guy Bolton , the longtime collaborator of , among other theatrical giants , Jerome Kern , George Gershwin , Cole Porter , and P. G. Wodehouse . At that time , Mr. Bolton had a new show opening on Broadway , and we were properly impressed ; after all , he was over eighty . We renewed our acquaintance with him the other day , upon hearing that he had recently finished another play ; we were even more impressed , inasmuch as he now counts himself to he ninety-five , is still exceedingly lively , and may be the oddest functioning dramatist of all time . ( Shaw lived to he a mere ninety-four and three months . ) During a tasty Irish-stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island , where he and his fourth wife , the former ballet dancer Virginia de Lanty , have lived off and on since 1943 , he told us that he is afraid he is slowing down : it took him three months to write his latest opus , " The Supper Party , " as opposed to the maximum of six weeks which was characteristic of his more prolific years . " I have delivered the script to my agent , Audrey Wood , " he said " We do n't have a producer yet , but I think it 's a marketable play . Well , we 'll see about that when I return from my annual trip to England . " Mr. Bolton was horn in England , at Broxhourne , Herts . He started off his working life as an architect , after studying at the Beaux-Arts in Paris , and thus did n't have a play produced until 1911 , when he was approaching the ripe old age of thirty . That first one was a corned ) called " The Drone , " which went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splash . In 1914 , he had his first success , a farce called " The Rude of Three , " and the following year he teamed up with Kern and they brought forth " Nobody Home . " It opened at the Princess Theatre , on Thirty-ninth Street east of Broadway  --  a slew of Bolton shows that played there became known as the " Princess plays " ? and was the first of many Bolton hit musicals : " Very Good Eddie , " " Sally , " " Oh , Kay , " " Girl Crazy , " " Anything Goes , " and several dozen et ceteras . " Very Good Eddie " was the second Princess play , and it was reviewed for Vanity Fair by Pelham Grenville Wodehouse , Bolton 's elder by a. year or so . " / had never met Plummie until we bumped into each other on opening night during the interval , " Bolton said . " I was a bit flustered then , because a couple alongside me had noticed during the first act that I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lines . If you do n't like this show , why do n't you go home ? ' one of them had said . Later that night , Jerry Kern took Plummie and me hack to his apartment , to wait for the dailies ' reviews , and the three of us decided to collaborate . After 1952 , Plummie ? lived right up the road here in Remsenhurg , and he and I used to walk our dogs together every day after lunch . We wrote together for fifty-four years , and one of our shows ? ' 0h , Lady ! Lady ! ' ? once played simultaneously at two theatres only a couple of hundred yards apart  --  the Princess and the Casino , at the corner of Thirty-ninth and Broad26 JANUARY 30 , 9 7 8 way . The Casino production was supposed to move straight on to Chicago as soon as we 'd had a look at it , but it was such a success that it stayed where it was for several weeks before we sent it West . " Bolton and 1Voclehouse teamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborator or another , or on his own , Bolton has had a hand in so many plays and musicals that he has no idea what the total is , though it is well over a hundred . Whether or not " The Supper Party " goes on the hoards this season , its author is anticipating revivals of " Tip-Toes , " a 1925 collaboration with Gershwin , and of " Anything Goes , " which dates back only to 1934 . " I probably wo n't get too personally involved , " he told us , " because the one thing my doctor has said to me is ' Do n't get in an argument . ' I never lose my temper . I do n't believe in arguing with people  --  except , of course , over something in connection with my work , I was living in England when Vinton Freedley persuaded Plummie and Cole and me to do ' Anything Goes , ' and we all forgathered at Le Tooquet . Very pleasant place to work . I thought that that was the best musical book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into rehearsal , I was in a hospital with blood poisoning , from a burst appendix , and Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse were brought into the picture and they went off on a different tack . It had been a challenge story originally , like ' My Fair Lady ' or ' Around the World in Eighty Days ' ? a show in which somebody decides to do something and the audience sits hack and says , ' All right , let 's see you do it , ' but Howard and Buck took most of that out and put in a lot of comedy . No matter . Because of Cole 's songs and Ethel Merman and the rest of the cast  --  incidentally , Ethel had made her debut in ' Girl Crazy , ' in 1930 ? it was a great success . Amateurs are still doing it all over the place . Ginnie and I practically live off it . I do n't know where they find all the amateurs . " The play of his that Bolton likes best , all things considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Winston Churchills , called " A Man and His Wife , " " We ran for six months in South Africa , to fantastic notices , with this marvellous Welshman , Emrys Jones , playing Churchill , " Mr. Bolton said , The first theatrical offering that Bolton recalls seeing was a production in England , when he was around ten , of " The Yeomen of the Guard . " " I went to see it after rriv paternal grandmother , a very old lady of seventy , who was related in some way to the people who made Pears ' soap , said to me , ' Guy , I hope you will never enter a theatre . It 's one of the properties of the Devil . ' I came to the United States for the first time just after that , and went to school for a while in New Rochelle . I am part American , actually .

I do most of my writing in longhand . I do n't like dictaphones , though my friend Edgar Wallace used them all the time . Ile died broke , and Ginnie and I had to ship his body back to England , but he was a fine man . He would keep his plays running long after they should have closed , simply because he was fond of actors . So em I. We saw a good deal of Wallace in Hollywood , while I was out there writing films . I quite liked that . At the time of the Depression , I was getting a very nice salary out there  --  about two thousand a week . But I prefer the theatre . " Mr. Bolton told us that his favorite twentieth-century playwrights , exclusive of those he has worked with , are S. N. Behrman , Robert E. Sherwood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted . " When I was living in London around 1927 ? Jerry Kern and I had our ' Blue Eyes ' opening there  --  I borrowed a flat in the Adelphi from the playwright Tony Harwood , " Bolton said . " Shaw lived next door . There was only a narrow space between his window and mine , and I could see him all the time puttering around in his woolly underwear . One day , he came to the window and said , ' Where is Tatty Ha rwoiid ? " In the United States , ' I said . ' Well , who are you ? ' Shaw asked . am a playwright , ' I said . ' Well , I am , too , ' he said . Then we chatted For a hit about playwrights  --  mostly , I 'm bound to say , about him , which was fine with me , " Move ECONOMIC optimism prevails in the vicinity of Eleventh Street and Sixth Avenue , where several commercial establishments have recently been playing musical storefronts . After forty-eight years at 457 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by a man called Al Barnett and was founded by his father , Jacob , has shifted sixty-five paces uptown , to larger quarters , at No. 467 , the quondam home of the Five Brothers Tavern . ( Last September , the Mentasti brothers , who had by that time dwindled from five to three  --  Angelo , Pete , and Joe  --  collectively decided to retire . ) At No. 465 , next door to the new Barney 's , the Famous Ray 's Pizza , which is owned by brothers named Mario and Lambert ? Di Rienzi ) , has been afflicted with too much business and has been forced to enlarge the premises for the second time in two years . About the time that the Mentasti brothers were pouring their farewell toasts , the Di Rienzo brothers studied the ever-lengthening queue of customers on the sidewalk outside the Famous Ray 's and decided to take woefully drastic action : they stopped serving special toppings ( sausage , pepperoni , etc. ) on individual slices of pizza until they could expand their kitchen space and install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final phase . But the sudden growth of the Famous Ray 's has knocked a Di Rienzo tenant  --  Little Tony 's No. 1 Unisex Haircutters , which is owned by a little man called Tony  --  off Sixth Avenue and around the corner to 103 West Eleventh . And , hack at No. 457 , a next-door neighbor  --  the Jefferson Market , owned by John Montuoriwill soon dismantle a wall and take over the space formerly occupied by Barney 's hardware Store . Q.E.D. A hidden character in this drama is Barney 's former landlord , at No. 457 , who wanted to raise the rent to a level that made Al Barnett see red ink . " Then , one morning early last year , Angelo Mentasti walked in here and said , ' Why do n't you buy my building ? ' just like that , " said Al on a re-cent Saturday , his last business day at No. 457 . " I 'd heard that it was for sale , but the price had sounded too high . We got together and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just closed this place up . " If Al was feeling melancholy about the move , he did n't reveal the strain . He is a pleasant-looking partly bald man in his late fifties , His round face seems to he perpetually creased by a near smile . Although Al 's old store was compact and cozy  --  eighteen by thirty-eight feet  --  not all its charms were immediately obvious . Somehow , within those confines Barney 's managed to carry an inventory of approximately twenty-thousand different items , including a lot of things  --  potting soil , Tupperware , kerosene lamps -- that do n't obviously belong in a hardware store . However , knowing that Barney 's probably stocked a certain item and being able to find it there were entirely separate matters . Indeed , one of the pleasures of a visit to the old Barney 's was searching for the unfindable object , finally giving up , and asking for help from one of the employees , who seem to be infected with Al Barnett 's natural politeness . " I 'm afraid we wo n't he able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told us . " It 's a lot bigger . It has the shelf space we need . It 'll have to become more of a self-service proposition . " As he finished that statement , a customer approached and asked where he could find a certain kind of small incandescent bulb . Al disappeared into his " office " ? actually a three-by-four-foot cubicle equipped with a desk , a telephone , a calendar , and Hoor-to-ceiling shelves  --  and soon emerged with the bulb that the customer had requested . " Is this what you 're looking for ? " he asked . " That 's it , " said the man . " Now , I 'll need six of those . " Al ducked hack into the office and reemerged with five more light bulbs . After the man had paid and left , Al said to us , " See how that guy wanted those bulbs ? I do n't know what for  --  refrigerate-a , oven , maybe . A dollar-fifty each . He wanted just as many as I happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to order more . The people come in and they need help . They say , I want something like  --  you know , it 's got a wing on it and you shove it in the wall . ' Right away , we know it 's a toggle bolt . I can read their minds a lot of times . Single girls come in ; they 've bought a lamp or a plant , and somebody tells them they can hang it from the ceiling . They walk in the door , and I say , ' What do you want  --  white , brass , or black hanging hooks ? ' They say , ' How 'd you know what I wanted ? ' It 's obvious  --  they 've been all around and finally they have to come to Barney 's Hardware . I know this neighborhood . " Al then excused himself to help another customer , leaving us to wonder whether by moving a block north he might alter the delicate demographics that guide his inventory decisions . At one-thirty the next afternoonSunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder in the rear of his new place of business supervising the dismemberment of an oak-andformica counter which had been the home of the cash register and the nail bins in the old store . To fit the scheme of the new store , it needed to he shortened . The metal bins had been removed , and two employees , Eddie and Sal , were using a framing square to chart the path that a jigsaw would make as it sliced off two feet of countertop . Seconds after Eddie went to work with the jigsaw , the blade broke . " Wonder where we can get a new one of these , " he said . " You 've got to go to a hardware store , " said Sal . " You know where there 's one around here ? " " Sure , down the street , " said Eddie . " Between Tenth and Eleventh . " " There 's no hardware store there , " said Al . " Just the shell of a hardware store . " Al relaxed on his perch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , " he said . " I took a vacation to the Bahamas not long ago , and ever since then I 've had terrible muscle pains . Seven-day weeks and muscle pains . " Then he invited us to accompany him through the sleet to No. 457 . On the way out , we noticed that a piece of marble engraved with " BARNEY 'S " had been embedded in the wooden floor . Al explained , " The contractor on the job said he 'd make me a tile with my name on it , and when he brought it in I felt like saying , ' My God , Vinnie , that looks like a tombstone . ' But I did n't say anything . " The scene inside the old store resembled the late stages of a looting spree . Sam Marra , the store manager , was bent over some wastebaskets and towel racks . When he stood up , he wore a slightly shocked , almost apologetic expression " I 've just never seen this place looking this way , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he already filled with all the merchandise that could fit , there was still plenty of stuff to be moved from the old place . " Now , I do n't know what we 're going to do about these , " said Al as he swung open a wooden display panel studded with drawer handles and exposed several rows of neatly stacked ancient-looking wooden boxes . They contained carbon drill bits , masonry hits , pipe taps , stove handles , casters , awls , hasp eyes , hinges , doorbells . " They made these drawers of pine , and nobody makes them like this anymore , so I ca n't throw them away , " said Al . " Maybe I can make room in the new place for about fifty drawers . have to separate the slow movers from the fast movers . These are slow movers here . " He pulled out a drawer full of bulky black door hinges . " And these are fast movers here . " He pulled out a drawer that was supposed to contain ceiling hooks . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eight-thirty the next morning , although the moving was not yet completed . At that hour , Sam Morra had a more cheerful look on his face than when we had last seen him . He was watching Jeff Barnett , Al 's eldest son , remove two " New Horne of Barney 's Hardware " signs from the front of the store , so that a window-washer , who had just arrived , could give the world a clear view inside . In the hack , Al was sitting in an armchair wondering aloud about opening-day lagniappe possibilities . " Think we should go for unlimited free doughnuts and coffee in here today ? " he asked . " We 've got to do something . " Within moments , there was something to do . A red-faced man who spoke with a brogue came in holding a tiny white plastic cylinder , and Sam went over to help him . Al watched the scene develop , and finally rose from his chair and approached the customer . " We specialize in self-service now , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he need , Sam ? " " One of these , " Sam said , holding up a plastic adapter for a faucet aerator . " I know just where they are , but I 've got to go to the other store to get it . " " You 're kidding ! " Al said . " No , but I 'm happy to do it , " Sam answered , and he led the customer out of the store and down the block . The Commissioner IT is n't easy for us to think of Henry Geldzander as " the Commissioner . " We were present at City Hall the other day when the former curator of twentieth-century art at the Metropolitan Museum took the oath of office as New York 's Cultural Affairs Commissioner ; we saw Mayor Koch administer the oath , in a ceremony attended by a host of well-wishers ; and afterward we witnessed any number of introductions to " Commissioner Geldzahler . " But the title still gives us trouble . For one thing , the Commissioner was wearing a pink silk how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , even though Geldzahler showed great dignity and considerable emotion during the brief ceremony , his rotund , bearded presence , alongside the tall and rather saturnine figure of the new Mayor , conspired somehow against municipal solemnity . " Did you realize I nearly choked up in there ? " he said to us a few minutes later , on the way out of the building . " I was n't prepared to he so moved . By the way , I 'm going to take TV lessons from someone David Garth recommended . Not to watch it  --  I 've got to learn how to move around and act natural on the tube . Where shall we go to lunch ? " An Italian restaurant in the Village having been decided on , we got into a taxi with the Commissioner and Christopher Scott , his close friend and assistant , and proceeded to examine his official certificate of investiture . The first thing we noticed about it was that " Geldzahler " had been spelled " Geldzhaler . " Commissioner Geldzahler ( this is getting easier ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At his request , his oath-taking had been delayed for several days , so that he could present a number of prospective purchases to the Met 's acquisitions committee while he was still a curator . His resignation was obligatory , because the Metropolitan 's status ? ? as a recipient of municipal funds would have placed him in a conflict-of-interest situation in his new role as a dispenser of such funds . As Cultural Affairs Commissioner , he was now an ex-officio trustee of the Met , but we wondered whether , having been there ever since he got out of graduate school at Harvard , in 1960 , he might not have regrets about leaving the place . He did have some , he told us as we sat down in the restaurant . " But I 'd come to feel very boxed in at the Met , " he said . " I feel they always underestimated my administrative abilities there . And then , I remember how happy I was during the time I worked for the National Endowment in Washington . " Geldzahler had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve as the visual-arts program director for the Endowment , and until 1969 he had acted as a consultant there . " It 's a great pleasure to help support the arts , " he went on . " And , as I recently said on television , after seventeen years at the Met it 's a great relief to get out of politics . " Always a somewhat controversial figure at the Metropolitan  --  he had dismayed some of his colleagues in the nineteen-sixties by appearing in avant-garde " happenings , " championing the art of Andy Warhol and other young masters , and being a highly visible and audible presence on the contemporary art scene  --  Geldzahler excited controversy in his new job even before he was sworn in . One member of the Mayor 's search committee to recommend candidates for the post of Cultural Affairs Commissioner had said that Geldzahler was the least qualified of the four people they proposed ( the others were Stephen Benedict , a consultant to the National Endowment for the Arts ; David Katzive , an assistant director of the Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set up the Department of Cultural Affairs when it was created , in 1976 , under Mayor Beame ) . We asked Geldzahler about this , and he gave us one of his forthright replies . " I got the job because my cousin Barbara Rauch worked for Ed Koch in one of his first campaigns , " he said . " She was the one holding the Bible while I took the oath . Actually , though , I do know Ed , I ran a couple of fundraising auctions for him when he was up for Congress . Last summer , I was out at Southampton and I got a call from him . ' Henry , ' he said , ' I 'm going to win . ' I said , ' Really ? ' He said , ' I mean it . There 's going to be a runoff , and I 'm going to win . ' He asked me to do another auction for him on Labor Day , which I did , and it all happened the way he said it would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't think those things are n't noticed . Once , / sent a small check to Paul O'Dwyer when he was running for senator against jack Davits , and two days later I ran into Javits and he said , ' I know what you did . ' " His first priority as Cultural Affairs Commissioner , Geldzahler told us , was " to catch up with what 's been done so far . " The Department of Cultural Affairs currently dispenses twenty-four million dollars a year , about ninety per cent of which , he said , goes to major cultural institutions  --  museums , orchestras , libraries , and so on . " That leaves very little to play with , or to encourage the new , " he went on . " Both Ed Koch and I want to get more money for cul ture . He 's really committed to that  --  he knows how important culture is in this town . New York is the arts center of the country , and I 'm just sure there 's federal money around that is n't being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do first . " Geldzahler went on to say that he would like very much to establish some sort of contact with Martin Segal , who recently resigned as chairman of the advisory Commission for Cultural Affairs  --  because , Segal said , nobody in the incoming Koch administration had bothered to consult him . It was Segal who engineered the creation of an independent Department of Cultural Affairs within the city government  --  previously , culture had been administered as part of the Parks , Recreation , and Cultural Affairs Administration  --  and Segal , in his unpaid advisory job , was the man primarily responsible for Mayor Beame 's energetic and enlightened activities on the New York cultural scene . GeIdzahler admires Segal , and would like to build a bridge and re-involve the former chairman in some active capacity . " But neither Ed nor I want to have anybody standing in the way of our ability to communicate directly , " he said . " From now on , cultural authority is going to be with the . Commissioner . " Did the Commissioner have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wen , if the electorate does n't want to give us another chance , I do n't consider myself unemployable , " he said . " But Ed 's talking about twelve years . He 's very sanguine . Besides , two vex ) nice things have happened so far  --  I 'm losing weight , and I need less sleep . That means I 'm excited and happy . "
