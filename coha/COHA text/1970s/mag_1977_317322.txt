From Boston Bureau Chief David Wood : <P> The beatings , the stonings and the angry demonstrations that accompanied school desegregation all seem to be behind . Where there was hatred , there now is relief and a rising sense of vitality . The South Boston Marshalls , which once fought against school busing , now run afterschool athletic programs . Luxury apartments and a hotel may be built near the places where motorcycle cops once roared into angry crowds to separate blacks and whites . " I feel hopeful about the city , " said Jerry Carey , a white social worker . " There is , overall , less paranoia , wider horizons . " <P> Nowhere was this new spirit more evident than on Boston Common on New Year 's Eve , when 65,000 people , summoned by the pealing of church bells , gathered to celebrate together . There were fireworks , a gigantic spinning globe with thousands of tiny lights , and a parade of celebrants wearing costumes , carrying giant puppets on poles and brandishing homemade noisemakers . " It was incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , all having a great time in the freezing cold , the whole thing organized and paid for not by the city but by the people themselves . " <P> There is a similar lowering of voices-and turning inward-elsewhere in New England . One sign is the sharp decline in the number of letters to the editors of newspapers . Said Roger Linscott , associate editor of the Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield , Mass. : " It 's not apathy . People are involved in public affairs , but it 's all local , at-home stuff . " Town meetings in rural Amherst , N.H. , have drawn overflow , boisterous crowds to debate how to limit the community 's growth . Hundreds of demonstrators have virtually halted plans to build a nuclear power plant at Seabrook , N.H. <P> The concern with local and private affairs shows up in other ways . On a typical Saturday morning , hordes of homeowners stagger out of local lumberyards with loads of paneling , paint and bathroom fixtures for some do-it-yourself remodeling . A surge in family outings has helped to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skating . <P> Despite these rosy-cheeked , Currier &; Ives scenes , there are many disconcerting signs of ill health . The long-term shift of money , jobs and population away from New England continues , leaving behind a disproportionate number of the elderly and the poor . Still , New Englanders do not have a sense that their problems can not be solved , only that the answers have not yet been found . Said Mary Newman , regional director for the Department of Health , Education and Welfare : " People are not scared , just confused . " Added Hartford , Conn. , Mayor George Athanson : " People want the buck to stop with them . They want to have something to say for a change . All you got ta do is show them how to do it . " New Englanders want Carter to supply this missing ingredient-which may be asking quite a bit .
