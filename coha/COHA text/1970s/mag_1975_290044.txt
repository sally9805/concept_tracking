In the turbulent ' 60s , students frequently went on strike to protest such weighty matters as the war in Southeast Asia , the draft or national political problems . Last week students at Brown University took to the picket line to speak out on what is strictly a campus affair : the school 's projected budget cuts and the lack of any student voice in the decision to slash expenses . <P> The dispute that led to the walkout began with a February announcement by President Donald Hornig , a science adviser to President Johnson , that Brown would have to trim its budget by 15% and its faculty by 16.5% over the next three years . The school was facing a $4 million deficit and could no longer afford to support its full academic program , one of the most innovative in the Ivy League . A student committee met with the administration but could not work out a compromise . When it became apparent that the university was adamant , the students voted last week to boycott their classes . <P> Higher Costs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping pace with increasing college costs ( tuition , room and board will be increased by $620 next fall , while the average scholarship will rise by only $66 ) . They also want Brown to drop plans to fire junior faculty , to admit more minority students , and to include students in budget decisions . <P> During the week , some 30% of Brown 's 5,119 undergraduates remained in class , while others marched outside buildings with signs saying CUT CLASS , NOT FACULTY and organized workshops on subjects ranging from " sexism awareness " to " prison reform . " The faculty did not take a stand , and most teachers showed up for class . Robley K. Matthews , chairman of the geology department , urged his professors to deliver their regular lectures even if not a single student was in the room ; he also advised them to make sure that topics covered in last week 's lectures would " figure heavily in the final examination . " <P> President Hornig was more understanding , conceding that the strike was " a reflection of the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't learned to live with . " Nonetheless , he added , " It is not clear to me how staying away from classes hurts anyone but the students involved . "
