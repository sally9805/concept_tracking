On a pleasant afternoon in Los Angeles last week , Bob Seagren walked out onto the track , chatted amiably with his competitors and with A.A.U. officials , and then proceeded to win the pole-vault event . His best jump of 17 ft. 4 in. was not really much of an accomplishment for Seagren ; he is co-holder with Sweden 's Kjell Isaksson of the world 's record of 18 ft. 4 in. set in El Paso , Texas , in May . But without top competition , Seagren explains , he ca n't reach the psychological plateau necessary to crack 18 ft . " In practice , even when I 'm trying , I can never get over 16 ft . " Lack of competition will not be a problem this summer in Munich , however . Then the 6-ft. , 175-lb . Seagren meets Isaksson in an aerial duel that very likely will decide who goes home with the Olympic gold medal in the event . <P> Flyaway . Seagren , 25 , must be conceded the edge in Munich on the strength of his 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartilage while horseback riding last summer . Running eight miles a day , including wind sprints up and down the steps of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , Seagren was back in competition by March 4 , vaulting a respectable 16 ft. 6 in. at the Meet of Champions in Los Angeles . <P> A sometime Hollywood bit player who is married to actress Kam Nelson , Seagren reached the heights early , when , as an undergraduate at the University of Southern California , he shattered N.C.A.A. and world pole-vaulting records . Still , nothing that he had ever done before came close to equaling his record-breaking leap in El Paso . He gives at least partial credit for that effort to a new pole he used that day , which was developed by Herbert Jenks , a fiber-glass expert from Carson City , Nev . Seagren 's pole weighs only 6 Ibs. instead of the standard 61 Ibs. and has a thinner than usual cross section , which allows for a better grip . That enabled Seagren to hold the pole higher and sprint faster on his takeoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seagren predicts , " I think we 'll see 19 ft. this year . " <P> The man who may well beat Seagren to 19 ft. is Kjell Isaksson , who is relatively unconcerned about the type of pole he uses . The wiry little ( 5 ft. 8 in. , 145 Ibs . ) Swede has broken the world record three times this year with springy vaults that give him the appearance of coming off a trampoline instead of a pole . Says Seagren 's former track coach , Donald Ruh : " Bob is a classic vaulter . Isaksson is more gymnastic . He makes it look almost effortless because he gets so much flyaway on top . " Adds Jenks : " Bob overcomes that by being stronger , faster and taller . " <P> Isaksson actually began his athletic career as a gymnast , bouncing away with a brace of trophies in his native Harnosand . When he was a teen-ager he moved to Stockholm . " His first day there , " his mother recalls , " he asked me if he could go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ? He came home later with two gold medals . He had won the high jump , and then borrowed a bamboo pole and won the pole vault . "
