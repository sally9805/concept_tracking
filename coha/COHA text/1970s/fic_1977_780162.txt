 | one . " He ran down the others in the stable , gave Winslow a brief appreciation of their market position . The reference to a " Paris One " had elicited no discernible pause . Having entertained the small talk , he got to the point : What precisely did Rousselot &; Partners want to know ? Winslow double-talked for ten minutes about certain unnamed American retail stores and **27;909;TOOLONG who were concerned about the future of the house of Fayol following the founder 's regrettable death . Naturally , they wanted to be assured that Fayol would continue in business and they were curious as to what directions , if any , the dead man had left behind . New products , new pricing structure , that sort of thing . Would Max run the show ? Or would the heirs come in ? Max made a good show of being assured . Of course the policies of the house would remain the same , new projects were always being explored , he valued highly the various commercial arrangements with America , and surely he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want it that way , he was certain . Winslow did n't think he sounded all that certain . They agreed to dine one evening . Max would delight in playing host , organizing a small party , perhaps , at some pleasant spot on the Ile . Winslow said that would be very nice . " Where are you planning to go this evening ? " Max asked . Winslow said he had a dinner date but had n't yet decided . " You must try L'Orangerie , " Max said . " You 'll need a reservation . I 'll have my secretary call . " Winslow told him the time and the men shook hands . " Jacques Fayol was my patron saint , " Max said piously . " It shall be my solemn task to keep his great house number one . " As if in afterthought , Winslow asked how he could get in touch with Fayol 's daughter . There was some business the bank wanted to discuss . Max shook his head . The girl was a bit , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You might ask the mother , " he suggested . Winslow , playing the rustic , said that was a splendid idea . Knowing it was not . Marianna Troy lived on the second floor of a hundred-year-old  | apartment building two thirds of the way up the hill of the rue de Boulainvilliers . There was a fine-looking meat shop , a seedy hardware store , a splendid bakery , and a chocolatier on the ground floor . She showed Winslow through the apartment ; huge rooms , high ceilings , and marble fireplaces . " It 's grand right now , " she said , " but it was hell staying warm last winter . If I did n't have a date I 'd get right into bed with my coat on when I came home and eat dinner off a tray and worry about falling asleep . I 'd read somewhere that was how you froze to death . " While she finished her hair , Winslow roamed around the big living room . Marianna had a desk covered with papers and old copies of Vogue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old upright Underwood . It was the Sunday crossword puzzle from the Paris Herald-Tribune , the same one that runs in The New York Times . Winslow was impressed . He had never seen anyone do a crossword in a typewriter before . There seemed to be no x-ing out , and what he could see of the puzzle was completed . He had an idea this girl , a journalist in and out of couture houses all day , partying with designers and their hangers-on at night , might be useful . She came out of the depths of the apartment , looking very good , smiling but cool , and he was glad he had called her . She might turn out damned useful . And not only on I'affaire Fayol . At L'Orangerie , Max 's call had gotten them one of the good tables , along the wall on the left . There were people waiting , but be and Marianna got their table right away . Her French was very good ; slangy , well accented , suggesting the aristocratic 16th arrondissement drawl . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied it . All through school , then at Yale , and I hadmy junior year here with a French family just up the street at La Muette . Then Vogue sent me over as a go-for after I won some sort of essay prize . And I 've been here almost two years now . What about you ? " Winslow talked about himself , something he usually avoided . " My mother was French , a minor actress in Paris in the thirties when my old man met her . She died a couple of years ago . My  | father hibernates up in Rhode Island , clipping coupons and reading The Wall Street Journal and grumbling about the Democrats and me . Marrying my mother was about the only instinctive thing he ever did . He fell in love , and he was kind of shocked to realize it . He 's been trying to live it down for thirty years . " " My mother and father are terrific . I 'd hate to have a parent I did n't like . " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's that sometimes I find some of him in me , characteristics I do n't especially admire : coldness ; a calculating way of looking at people . I suppose I 'm reacting against things I do n't like about myself when I criticize him . " The girl was listening carefully , so Winslow sheered away from self-analysis and turned flippant . " We get along in a formal sort of way : he calls me Anthony ' and I call him sir . ' We just do n't agree on much . When my mother was alive she maintained a sort of uneasy truce . She 'd listen to us nattering for just so long and then she 'd explode in wonderful backstage French idiom . I went in the Marines to devil my father and then got into banking just to keep the peace . But I realized I really liked it , which surprised hell out of me . I liked working with money , liked the leverage , and I had the right instincts . Psychiatrists and clergymen and doctors are always coping with infinities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finite world . No matter how enormous the problems , the dreams , the plans , no matter how complex , there are always solutions . When my mother died , New York was going into the hole so I dropped out and went to work with a guy called Rohatyn who was trying to keep it functioning . My father thought I was a fool . " He paused . " All I got out of it were two of the best , toughest years of my life and a tremendous offer from a fine old merchant bank . So , once again , I think my old man was wrong . And he 's still absolutely certain I was . " He paused , " Is n't this boring you ? " " Not at all , " she said . The food came and they got into it . The place was crowded , noisy ; but pleasantly , the clientele attractive .  | " You come here much ? " She shook her head . " It 's a bit pricey for the men I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Frenchman with the usual motives . It 's , I do n't know , a bit staged . " " Max suggested it . " " He would . " " Oh ? " " Jacques Fayol was one of the big gourmets . Gourmands ' may have been more like it . Max usually tagged along . A place like this , they 'd make a fuss over Fayol . He 'd spend a couple of thousand francs here in an evening . You know , a Latour ' 6i out of the cellar , the oldest brandy , gobbets of caviar to start . I had dinner with them once , a whole bunch of us from Vogue . Fayol stood us a meal and then was outraged two months later when we put a Saint Laurent dress on the cover instead . " " You like fashion ? " She shrugged . " I do n't like or dislike it . I 'm not a fanatic . I 'm easy to fit , I like nice things , but I could never get caught up in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , it 's divine . Glorious . Perfection . " Marianna shook her head . " I 'm a reporter , really . I look at the clothes and take notes and I ask questions . Surprising how much you can learn simply by asking a designer how he achieved a certain effect and why . " Winslow decided he had an opening . " I 've been asking questions too . Trouble is , I do n't understand all the answers . " " Maybe you ask the wrong questions . " The waiter cleared the plates and they ordered the Brie and soda crackers to finish off the last of the wine . " How do I learn the right ones ? " he asked . She laughed . " You take bright young junior editors from Vogue to dinner in expensive restaurants and ply us with wine and cheese and souffles and we tell you everything you want to know . Even if it is n't true . " " Miss Troy , " he said , " you are on the payroll as of now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . " There were some people at the next table who seemed to be  | half listening to their conversation , and so over the coffee Winslow suggested they go somewhere else to talk . " How about Regine 's ? " " You have an exotic notion of where people go to talk in Paris . At Regine 's you ca n't hear anything but the music . Come on , I 'll take you to a place . We can have a brandy and it 'll be quiet . " The place was Les Nuages , in an alleyway just around the corner from St.-Germain . It was smoky and nice . They got a table . Young men in turtlenecks and pretty girls in jeans or suede skirts sat talking , drinking , laughing . There was no music . " This is a great hangout for young journalists from L'Express . Some of the left-wing writers . The young ones . Not Sartre or that crowd . They 're much too grand for a dive like this . " They ordered brandy , and Winslow gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . so , naturally , as bankers for several American companies that do business with Fayol , we want to know what the hell 's going to happen . Can a guy like Max really keep the house operating ? " " Do n't underestimate Max , " she said seriously . " Fayol surrounded himself with good-looking boys like Max . Called them his little monks . ' They were all talented , some of them very bright . And it was competitive as hell . For Max to emerge on top , he had to be pretty good , pretty tough . " " Then it was n't just sex ? " " Oh , sure , " she said , " that must have been part of it . A big part . Old Fayol was n't your usual fashion pederast . He 'd go through periods , just girls . He 'd devour them by the score . I suppose it was like that when he married Helene . I 've seen pictures of her . Incredibly beautiful in those days . Then , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max was recruited during one of those times . He 'd been a male hooker ; did some modeling ; tried to get into the movies . A tough guy for all he 's gay . " " How old are you ? " " Twenty-three . Why ? "  | " They teach you all this at Yale ? " She laughed . " At boarding school . New Haven was really very conventional . " " I never doubted it . " He smiled . " Do you know his daughter , Anne ? " " Sure , Anouk . Her pet name . She was at that silly party Blatter gave . Tall girl , dark hair . Supposed to look a bit like me . She sleeps around , sniffs coke , hates her mother . The usual happy , well-adjusted young Parisienne . " " You 're not cynical ? " " Me ? A cynic at twenty-three ? Just say I 'm a bit skeptical . I question people 's motives . " " Mine ? " She looked at his face . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not terribly anxious about it . " They got a cab and went back to her apartment and she poured another brandy for him . " Not for me . Not while I 'm still questioning motives . And as long as I have to work tomorrow . " " It 's Saturday . " She knew , but there was a photo session . During the pret-aporter showings they could n't get the clothes out of the couture houses to shoot during the week . The buyers were trying them on . You had to take the pictures over the weekend , she said . Winslow finished his drink . She 'd put some music on , Leo Ferre songs . They sounded good . He took her arms with his hands . She raised her head and kissed him . He could feel her breasts through the man 's shirt she wore . He reached the top button and opened it . He felt her breast . She leaned against him . " Is this part of the employment contract ? " she asked in a whisper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the deal . " Her shirt was open to her waist . Winslow stepped back and looked at her . She was very lean . She pulled the shirt out of her skirt and let it drop to the floor . She had very nice breasts , not large , but firm . Her nipples were erect . She ran a slender hand through her long hair .  | " I do n't know why , " she said , " but I 'm embarrassed . I 'm not usually embarrassed . " " I 'm sorry . " " No , " she said . " Do n't be . I 'm not sorry . I do this sort of thing occasionally . Well , maybe more than occasionally . But it 's just part of being an American girl on the loose in Paris . It does n't really mean anything . With you , I do n't know . I feel uptight . " He smiled . Then he bent down and picked up her shirt and draped it around her shoulders . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe tomorrow you can question them again . And maybe you wo n't be uptight . " She frowned . " Look , you can stay . I mean , we can ... " He shook his head . " Kiss me good-night . I do n't want to hustle you . " " No , " she said . " Do n't hustle me . " She said it quietly . Winslow hailed a cruising cab at the corner of Avenue Mozart and told him the hotel . It was funny , he thought , the way they 'd gone to the verge and then backed away . The girl was n't a tease , he was sure of that . But she 'd pulled back . And in a way , he was glad she had . Not that he would n't have enjoyed making love to her . He could see her body , bare to the waist . He wondered what her legs were like . You could n't tell with the mid-calf skirt she wore . Hell , he told himself , she 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything else was right , why should n't they be ? There was a message : " Telephonez a M. Delane . " He called . The designer was asleep . He sounded groggy but intent . " I found out something . Maybe it 's nothing . Tomorrow , we go to the Stade Colombes , watch the rugby international . It 'll be a good match . And we can talk . " They agreed to meet for lunch at a restaurant on the rue de Longchamp . Delane would have his car . " I was afraid of that , " Winslow said , but Paul was too sleepy to riposte.  | Winslow turned out the light and undressed . It was another warm night , and he opened the shutters . The apartment across the street was dark . He stood there for a moment smoking a last cigarillo and thinking how fortunate it was Marianna Troy knew Anouk Fayol . If he could n't track down Anouk any other way , he could use Marianna . Then , annoyed with himself for this tendency to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked , he switched back to thinking about how she looked and about things they might be doing together . He stared out into the night . He did not see the black Citroen parked in the alley between the hotel and the RTL building . And if he had , he would have assumed it was simply parked there for the night .  | With the possible exception of polo , international rugby is the most exclusive of all the great team games . Only five European countries play world class rugby , and except for France , they are all from the British Isles . And when one of these " foreign " teams comes to Paris , university-educated Frenchmen flock to the Stade Colombes as cripples to Lourdes . Delane parked his Porsche about a mile from the stadium , paying an enterprising householder a few francs to let him park on the lawn , and he and Winslow walked through the stucco town of Colombes with its dozens of cafes . The afternoon was warm and the cafe doors open and they could hear accordions playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last piss against the concrete wall . French sports arenas are not noted for their sanitary facilities . The two men had eaten at Jamin , the horse-players ' restaurant , drinking Bordeaux and eating the eggs and truffles and talking only of the match and not of Fayol or of their telephone conversation of the night before . The English were in town . Delane said it would be a good match . Whichever team won today would win the Tournoi des Cinq Nations . It was always good when the French played the English . " We 've never really forgotten Agincourt , you know , " Delane said . They had pretty good seats , halfway up in the grandstand .  | Some Englishmen ran out on the field before the match , waving signs and shouting " For England and Saint George ! " The French whistled derisively and then gave a roar when some French kids ran around the green turf carrying cardboard roosters . The English players wore white shirts with little roses embroidered on the chest . They were big , blond boys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , faster . When they moved the ball the crowd swayed , singing " Allez la France , Allez . " The French passing , even among the more ponderous forwards , was intricate . The English dug in and held . One boy came out of a scrum with blood running down his face . The referee whistled a halt and the English trainer ran a sponge over the cut and the match went on . " I may have something for you , " Delane said in a normal conversational tone under the noise of the crowd . " About perfume . " Winslow nodded and leaned slightly closer to Delane , his eyes still on the field . " Yesterday was the weekly meeting of the Chambre Syndicale de la couture , " Delane explained . " All the couture houses get together to discuss matters of common interest : labor difficulties , taxes , foreign duties , that sort of thing . Nothing about fashion itself , you understand , just the commercial aspects . Anyway , at yesterday 's meeting there was a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What sort of talk ? " Winslow asked , his cigar bobbing in his mouth . Delane lifted his hands . " Well , it began innocently enough . The usual complaints about price , some talk of labor unrest , rising costs . The usual chat . Cardin and Givenchy were represented . Their managers did most of the talking . But since they are always complaining , I took no notice . Perhaps it was nothing . But since all of us lose money on clothes and make it on the perfumes , we listened . Who knows ? Maybe there really is trouble . " Then someone , it may have been Courreges , said this was old ground , that he was more alarmed about something else , some  | vague talk about a cabal among the landowners . I can tell you , my dear Tony , my ears perked up at that . " Winslow puffed out slowly . " Why ? " he asked , still watching the match . " Ah , " Delane said , gesturing dramatically even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked myself . Because such a thing is patently absurd . Those farmers of Grasse , they hate everybody . Superstitious peasants . They could never be or ganized . Never . " " Then why did your ears perk up ? " " My dear ... " Delane began . " You know , that sounds better in French , " Winslow protested politely , with a glance at the macho rugby fans all around them . " Okay , mon cher , " Delane continued , " but fashion designers are like women . We are worse than women . Every month a small crisis . Every month the end of the world . It is like California ( he pronounced it Cal-ee-fornia ) where your San Andreas Fault is always going to put Hollywood among the fishes . So when I hear ridiculous rumors of cabals in Grasse , I report them faithfully to you . Even when I believe such talk is groundless ; impossible , hysterical ravings . " Delane was satisfied he had made the point and he stared out at the field , puffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marvelous passing maneuver by the French halfbacks . Winslow ' s face was still turned toward the field but his eyes glazed over and he missed a game-saving tackle on the touchline by one of the English . " Why , " he asked Delane , " is Grasse so fucking important ? They grow roses everywhere . " Delane turned to him . Patiently , almost patronizingly , he began . " My dear , it is in Grasse that we distill the natural oils from the flowers . Not only the roses . In fact the Bulgarians grow better roses for perfume . We have les roses de mai , but more important we have the lavender , the lilac , a little violet , the narcissus , the  | jasmine , some mimosa , some oak moss that looks like the moss on your trees in Georgia and Florida but which is different . Grasse is the heart of the floral end of the perfume trade . The flowers are grown , the petals are picked , and wholesalers buy by the pound , by the burlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into steam distillation , into ether baths , into hot wax . I do n't understand all the mechanics , but what happens is , when you put the petals into one of these solvents the oil floats to the top and you draw it off . " And that oil ( he emphasized the words ) is essential to the manufacture of quality perfume . Other things go into it , but without those oils , nothing happens but some cheap cologne the whores of Les Halles douche themselves with during menstruation . Nothing . " Winslow nodded . ' When Delane started to elaborate , Winslow cut him off . He wanted to absorb that much and chew it a bit . " Back up a bit . What I do n't understand is the Grasse angle . Roses grow in America . You say the Bulgarians grow roses . Then why . . . ? " Delane was patient . " For one thing , Bulgaria is in another sphere of political influence . They sell their attar to the Warsaw Pact market . For another , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' just wo n't do , well , consider the analogy of our vineyards . Everyone grows grapes , and yet it is French grapes , and then only grapes from certain precisely defined regions of France , that produce great wine . The soil , the annual rainfall , the angle at which the sun strikes the slope of the hill , the temperature at harvest time , all these variables combine to create a drinkable grape . So it is with the flowers of Grasse . God knows why , I do n't , but there it is . " He grinned , sure he had satisfied Winslow 's curiosity . But the American , trained to ask questions and then more questions , was already thinking about Maggy Moal 's promise to put him in touch with her manager at Grasse . As helpful as Delane was trying to be , it was apparent he was n't the expert . Perhaps Maggy 's man would be . Perhaps the riddle could be solved in Grasse . Perhaps . . .  | " Regard , Tony , " Delane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the match , a draw that satisfied no one , drunken Englishmen and sulky Frenchmen pushed their way slowly out of the stadium . Winslow and Delane let most of the crowd dissipate before they started down out of the grandstand toward the exit tunnel . Delane was blaming the result on the referee . " You get a Welshman in a situation like that and what do you expect ? To the French , he 's a coal miner who should be singing in chapel . To the English he 's one of their goddamn provincials , fit for drawing water and making bricks . The poor fellow did n't make a decent call all afternoon , he was so awed . " He looked toward heaven . " God save us from Third World domination . " Winslow laughed . " I 'd never considered Vales part of the Third World . " " Ah , but what does an American know ? I once . . . " He stopped in mid-sentence . Then , very calmly , he said : " Antoine , do not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the step ahead . We are not alone . " A thrill ran through Winslow . He wanted to look up , to look around . Instead , he concentrated on the concrete steps that led to the exit . They were at the iith row now , then the loth , then the 9th ... " Two men , " Delane said , still speaking quietly and without any great sense of drama . But there was an edge to his voice , as if he was rather pleased to be involved in something after such a betise of a match . " Watching us . Watching you , I suppose . Who the hell wants to see me ? " " They French ? " Winslow asked . He was at the third step now . " I suppose . Their suits are tacky enough . Hey , you have n't been fucking around with some married woman ? Could be her husband and the brother , you know . " They were at the tunnel now . " Do we go through ? " " Sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were a few men ahead of them in the tunnel but they were fans , moving toward the gate . Winslow felt a damp feeling  | at his back , but in a moment they were through the dim tunnel and out in the sunlight . He touched Delane 's arm , thinking to suggest that they wait and see just what the hell this was all about ; and then , as Delane looked up , he shook his head . " Nothing . Let 's get the car . " There was no point to having an argument here  --  or worse , a brawl . Junior partners at Rousselot did not brawl in public ; they did not get into slanging matches with Frenchmen who , for all he knew , were just a couple of rugger fans . They passed out through the gate , past the last spectators pissing against the stadium wall , and down the street and into the town . " Okay , we 're clear , " Delane said from the corner of his mouth . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the Occupation , when I was ten years old , I ran messages for six months for the maquis . I always know when someone is watching me . " They went through the town and got the car . There was no indication they were followed . The two men in their tacky suits were gone . Delane went up and down Colombes streets for a few minutes , getting himself thoroughly confused and nearly hitting a a CV at an intersection . He shook his head . " Gone , " he said . " If they were ever there , " Winslow said dryly . Delane gave him a pained look and they headed for the autoroute and Paris . Delane successfully got the Porsche halted in front of Winslow 's hotel without , for once , ricocheting off the curb or another car . Winslow started to get out , then stopped . " Paul , what 's Madame Claude 's phone number ? " Delane gave it to him from memory , without even a wisecrack . Why not ? he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbled the number on his program from the rugby match and asked , " Do you think those guys were really watching us ? " Delane frowned . He hated being doubted . " Okay , " Winslow said . " Have a good weekend . I 'll be in touch . "  | He went in , picked up his messages , and opened the door to his room . The laundry was on the dresser , neatly boxed . He opened the box to be sure the shirts were unstarched . He got out of his clothes and took a shower . Clouds were building up in the west , coming off the Channel and across Flanders and northern France , promising rain , but it was still warm . He wrapped a towel around his middle and sat up on the bed with the phone in his hand . " ETOile 56-73 , s'il vous plait . " The phone rang a couple of times . " Allo ? " He asked for Mme. Claude . The woman said this was she . Winslow spoke English . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Winslow . Paul Delane gave me your number . I 'm at the Hotel ? . There is a young lady I met the other evening . I believe she is a . . . friend of yours . Her name is Anouk ... " The woman who said she was Mme. Claude promised to call back . She would have to track down this Anouk . These girls , so young , so beautiful , all with their little sports cars and their friends in the country , it was impossible to keep track . But she would do what she could . When she hung up he understood very well this meant his hotel would be called , Delane would be queried , and Winslow 's credentials as a visiting businessman with money to spend would be carefully checked . Mme. Claude had paid protection money for too long to too many high officials to do anything reckless . Winslow looked at his watch . He thought about phoning Henry Rousselot . It would be early afternoon in Connecticut . Rousselot would surely be on the course at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report ? Not that much , and Rousselot was a man who wanted final reports , not interim meanderings and hunches . Marianna Troy was still working . He 'd phoned her apartment and then the Vogue office and someone told him she was at a shooting at the Place du Trocadero . Winslow got up from the bed  | and pulled on his shorts and some flannel trousers and tugged a turtleneck over his head . He got the Burberry out of the closet and shoved some cigars into his pockets . He told the cab driver to drop him at the opposite side of the Place , near the cafe . Taking photographs , getting everything in focus , and not cutting off the heads or the feet was a profound mystery to Anthony Winslow , and he did not want to drive up to where they were doing their pictures and screw things up and get Marianna into difficulty . He could have spared himself the worry . It was eight o'clock , the sun nearly down , and the clouds cutting the last of the light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaillot . The Tour Eiffel directly across the river had just been illuminated and against its light he could see the team of photographers and models working on the broad , polished , almost-marble flagstones on which the French kids love to roller-skate . As he got closer he could pick out the photographer himself , an elfin little man entirely in black , with what looked like a woman 's stocking over his head , keeping his hair tidy in the damp wind . One assistant was holding a bit of aluminum reflector sheet , another had a sort of silvery umbrella . The models  --  there were two of them  --  struck poses and the photographer capered , shooting all the time with a flash and jabbering at them nonstop . Staying always behind him , moving easily on her long legs in the well-cut dark-blue velvet jeans , was Marianna . She wore a khaki shirt with big patch pockets over her breasts and a quilted down ski anorak that flopped open as she moved . She saw Winslow coming and smiled over the head of the photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winslow stood there , a few yards away . They changed models now , and Marianna wrote down something on the clipboard . After another few moments the photographer looked up at the darkening sky and groaned . " Alors , c'est fini . " The assistants began to pack up the equipment and the two models huddled together , talking about whatever it is models talk of endlessly , and Marianna came over to Winslow .  | " Well , and now you see how glamorous it is . " He laughed . " I 'm nothing but a bloody script girl . " " With no dialogue , " he said . " Oh , you get dialogue . Those models . My god , they say nothing but they talk constantly . " " Drink ? " She nodded . " Maybe something hot . It 's windy out there . " She took his arm and they strode back across the Place to the cafe , both of them tall and moving neatly through the traffic . They got a table and sat down . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the extra chair . Winslow noticed she had blue eyes under the long , dark hair . It was funny , he had n't noticed that the night before . He had a beer and she sipped hot chocolate . " Tell me about the fashion business , " he said . " Well , if you want the big picture , you subscribe to Vogue and you read Women 's Wear every day and you go to lunch at grand restaurants and give intimate little dinner parties for Valentino and Bill Blass and Madame Gres . If you want the small picture , you buy yourself a clipboard and get sore feet standing around for five or six hours telling the girls not to chew gum and fetching coffee for the photographer and trying to make sure the dresses get back to the couture house without being stolen or having too many cigarette holes burned in them . " " But you do n't have to do that tonight . " " No , Scavullo is a jewel . He 's the one with the stocking cap . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop off the clothes . Thank God , I 'm really flaked out . " " Ever been to Grasse ? " " No , is n't that where the attar comes from ? " " Yeah . I might go down there for a day or two . Sounds like an interesting place . " " I do n't know much about it , " Marianna said . " But every night before he climbs into bed with his lover , every couturier  | says his prayers for Grasse . They make their big money from perfume . " " That 's what Delane told me . We went to the rugby today . England versus France . " " Quels sports ! Well , Delane would know more about it . But what happens is , the couture is sort of like a lab  --  all experiments and punctured dreams and tantrums and back to the drawing board in the morning . They lose money on it , all of them . " " Even at a thousand dollars a dress ? " " Even at fifteen hundred  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric is forty or fifty dollars a yard , everything is constructed : the interlinings and so on . No automation at all . But the couture clothes , if they 're any good , are what get the headlines . They show up on the cover of Elie or Vogue or WWD , and Eugenia Sheppard goes ape in her column and The Times runs a sketch and voila , Delane or Chanel or Fayol or whoever is suddenly a genius . So everyone rushes in to buy the copies of the couture clothes , the machine-made mass-produced ready-towear , the accessories , the handbags , the furs , the pantyhose ? anything with his label on it . And , the most profitable of all , the perfume . " " The clothes get the publicity and the smelly stuff makes the money . " She shook her head . " Only a banker could put it so neatly . " " And where does a famous fashion editor like you buy her clothes ? " " Oh , me . Well , I got this anorak last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store at home and the pants at New Man . " " New Man ' ? " " Sure , I always wear men 's jeans . They fit better . Do n't you think ? " She seemed quite serious . " I think they 're the most beautiful pants I 've ever seen . " Two hours later , after a steak and pommes frites and two bottles of Brouilly , the beautiful pants were tossed carelessly over the back of a chair in her bedroom and Marianna Troy of Yale  | and Vogue magazine was kneeling astride Anthony Winslow of New York and Rousselot &; Partners , thrusting herself up and down , as her small , high breasts bobbed and she panted with pleasure . When she had rolled off and now lay cradled in his arm , her head against his shoulder , she said in a low , happy voice , " I 've never screwed a banker before . " " You 're my first Vogue editor , " he said . " And ? " " I 'll send in my subscription first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew to Nice , rented a car , and drove north from the sea over the coastal hills to the town of Grasse . Wherever he turned in Paris , someone  --  Maggy Moal , Delane , Marianna  --  was talking about Grasse . Maybe there would now be some answers . He stopped once for directions at a gas station and to phone ahead , and when he got to Maggy 's factory her man , large , hearty , and competent-looking , came out to greet him . " An honor , monsieur . To think , all the way from America . From New York . " Only from Paris this time , Winslow said . It was good of the manager to receive him . " When there is a message from Madame Moal , " the man demanded , " could I do otherwise ? " There was more politesse and then the ritual tour of the factory , the storerooms half full of petals ( " the season is still young " ) , the great vats brimming with hot liquid , distilling off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " to clear the head , monsieur . The flowers can intoxicate " ) followed by lunch . " Now , " Maggy 's manager said , " what can I tell you ? " He wielded a toothpick rather daintily behind his napkin and sat back , waiting for Winslow 's questions .  | While Winslow was doing his homework in the town of Grasse that Monday , other things were happening . In other places . The bureaucracy of Teheran is like all bureaucracies everywhere . Except , in these times of rich oil , more so . On this particular Monday morning Zader Nafredi 's chief , a stooped , angry little man who might have reminded you of Mohammed Mossadegh , issued certain instructions . Oh , of course he had faith in Nafredi 's competence . The man was too frightened not to succeed . But it was well to hedge one 's bets when playing at the heavy tables . He dialed a certain number and issued instructions . The American , representing the competition in this affair , should be bribed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His listener asked what if bribing and muscling failed . Nafredi 's chief made a small moue . " Then , of course , you must do what must be done . " He hung up , buzzed for fresh coffee and those sweet biscuits he had flown in from Fortnum &; Mason , and meditated upon Nafredi . It was unfortunate they had to rely on such men , to employ dancing masters to turn the heads of young women . Nafredi 's record in such matters was impressive indeed . His chief wondered what young women saw in him . And then , remembering a pleasant interlude the previous evening , he wondered what Nafredi saw in these young women he was assigned to seduce , when there were so many young boys there for the asking . The chief considered informing Nafredi of the new " arrangements . " No , he concluded . The fig and the date prosper in the same oasis without necessarily having been informed of the other 's existence . In New York there was a call for Henry Rousselot . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaware Corp . There had been no reports , no indication of progress from Rousselot 's man in Paris . " Interim reports are discouraged , " Rousselot said coldly . " A good man has been assigned to the problem , and if there is a solution you can be reasonably assured he will find it . "  | But of course , Wilmington appreciated that , without question . But , and the " but " had an edge , acquisition of the House of Fayol was of considerable importance . Certain other deals hinged on its satisfactory conclusion . More than a measly $85 million was involved . Rousselot 's ears perked . He 's been uncomfortable with this assignment from the start . Deadlines . . . interim reports ... offering $85 million for a company worth $zo or $25 million . Not at all the sort of tidy banking he understood . Instead of clarification , Rousselot got more questions . " We understand the key to the whole business is this young woman , Anne Fayol . Only she can sign over . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say yes . Or no . " There was a pause . Then : " Is this fellow Winslow the sort who . . . ? " Henry Rousselot cut off the question . Angrily he snapped , " Rousselot &; Partners employ bankers . Not gigolos . We are not ... an . . . escort ... service . " The caller apologized ; smoothly sought to calm the ruffled banker . Delaware knew it was in good hands , " the best hands . " The Delaware Corp . would be patient . Unmollified , Rousselot coughed into the telephone and hung up . In Wilmington , the Delaware Corp . executive put down his telephone . Rousselot was a fine banker , none better , but the executive was concerned . This Fayol business was n't all as cutand-dried as they 'd intimated to Rousselot . Perhaps the banker , celebrated as a hard man but punctilious , was beginning to sniff out Delaware 's plans , and did not like the smell . Well , if there were any doubts about the reliability of Rousselot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get into the act itself . The executive picked up an internal line . " Carl , " he asked , " do we have anyone who knows his way around the French couture ? " In his apartment over the couture establishment of the late  | Jacques Fayol , Max was dressing for the office . He was not content . It was not fashion that was worrying him . It was this nagging silence on the part of the heirs . You 'd think Helene Fayol or that junkie daughter of hers would have called on him already ; would have begged him to keep the house of Fayol together , maintain the business , ensure that the collection was made . But there was n't a word , just this unsettling silence . By every right Max knew he should already have been confirmed as permanent director of the establishment with a tasty new contract and a share of the profits . Fashion was not the immediate concern . The July couture collection would be fine . Fayol had done the sketches before leaving for Marrakesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns had been cut , even a few of the canvas toiles had been basted up . The May ready-to-wear collection was virtually complete . The cutters and tailors of the Maison were certainly up to turning out a " representative " ready-to-wear collection in two weeks ' time and the couture collection in July for the press , the buyers , and the rich private clients . Thinking of the press cheered Max slightly . He knew how they loved an angle , and here was one ready-made for them : Jacques Fayol 's Last Collection ! But after July , what about the ready-to-wear collection in November , and then next January 's couture collection ? Suddenly , Max felt less than secure . Of course he could hire a top-notch outside designer to come in and do the job if none of the " little monks " in the design studio seemed up to it . But giving that sort of power to one man would create a monster . What would the Maison then need of Max himself ? No , better to keep the thing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lost " drawings by the old man , keep the legend going until he 'd gotten Helene and the girl , Anouk , to give him the long-term contract that would ratify his authority . He would think about it . Somewhat brighter , he slipped on the silk-lined vest of his narrow-bodied Renoma suit , very " English gent-luh-man , " and  | began to select a tie . Memories of last night crowded in . He really must stop picking up boys on the street . They were usually so unsatisfactory . He must look over the " little monks " again today . Perhaps , with the old man out of the way , he would bestow his blessing on one of them . A more-or-less permanent arrangement of that sort was really much more suitable to his new position than the casual liaisons of the Boul Mich . Now if only this American fellow Winslow were n't complicating the picture .. . On that same Monday morning Paul Delane was still in bed . He regarded himself in the mirror of the armoire across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously he had not shaved , the eyes were heavy , and he was fatigued . Truthfully fatigued . Time was , Delane told himself , when he had either the good sense to go to bed , early and alone , on Sunday nights , or the youthful resilience to indulge in idiocies and survive them . Last night he had lacked both good sense and resilience . The trouble had been an Australian girl , tall and blond and with the most delightfully funny speech mannerisms . Although he did not tell the Australian girl this , Delane was convinced his English was better than hers . He wondered if they all spoke that way in her country . He also wondered if they were all as voracious . He had met her at Castel 's , dancing with someone left over from the rugby match , one of the larger Englishmen . The boy had had the decency to go outside into the rue Princesse and be ill in the street , and that had given Delane his opening . More drinks , more music ( the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxicab when the Englishman staggered back inside , the giving of instructions and the paying of bribes to assure that the Englishman got back to his hotel safely , and then more drinks . He had gone to the girl 's hotel . She had taken off her clothes right away ( no need for diplomatic niceties with this one ) and they had made love . They had made love again . They had made love a third time . At that point it was three o'clock in the morning and Paul Delane was void in trumps . When he notified the  | Australian girl of this she became annoyed . She sat up in bed , the long blond hair flowing , those incredible breasts standing erect , and her eyes flashing . " And I was told you Frenchies had something . " She got out of bed , and despite his fatigue , Delane had watched her buttocks and her long legs and the narrow waist as she stalked into the bathroom . He half expected tears , perhaps a brisk comb-and-brush-up , and a renewed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before , with a short , translucent robe wrapped around her . " You get some sleep , luv , " she declared , " I 'll be down the hall . " Oh ? Delane said , down the hall ? Yes , the girl said . " That bloody Englishman must be recovered by now . " Sadly , Delane had watched her go . More sadly , he got up , dressed , and went home . Now it was morning and he felt , approximately , like death . He wondered absently how Tony Winslow was doing down in Grasse . He hoped he would n't get into trouble . He had n't liked the look of those gorillas at the Stade Colombes . Then , feeling his own pain , he consoled himself in the knowledge that banking was a sober and dignified trade and that bankers rarely were roughed up or knocked about in the normal course of business . Except , and he smiled despite the hangover , by Bonnie and Clyde and that lot . Zader Nafredi had passed a delightful weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just completed his usual gallop in the Bois . He walked the horse back slowly to the stables , chatting with the pretty girl on the roan , cooling out the horse and realizing just how well riding clothes suited him . The girl had noticed as well . How could she not ? The English hacking jacket , the puttycolored britches , the polished boots . . . no wonder she had fallen in next to him on the path and had ridden along , stride for stride , chatting amiably about " chere maman " and next weekend 's revels at Deauville . Ah , Nafredi told himself , not for the first time , this was indeed Paname . There was nothing in Teheran to match it . He hoped this American would not cause trouble .  | Trouble was something Nafredi did not need right now . He was glad he had taken certain steps to ensure that Mr. Winslow would not disturb his tranquility . " Handbags , Marianna , handbags , that 's your assignment . Creamy , luxurious leathers , horse brass fittings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took notes . The editors of Vogue always spoke this way . Hyperbole was the language of fashion and no one spoke it more fluently than Vogue 's editors . " Marianna , I want to see handbags that will cause me to laugh , to weep , to shudder with intensity . Bring me handbags that sing , that dance , that dominate a room . Handbags that carouse , that whisper , that titillate my every appetite . Fetch them , dear girl , fetch them in the hundreds . I shall reproduce them in full color on our pages and millions of American women will thank you . " " Yes , ma'am , " Marianna said , and prepared to go out into the handbag market and pick out the bags to be photographed . It had been like this all morning . No time to think about Winslow . Well he probably was n't thinking of her . It had probably been a mistake to go to bed with him so soon . Probably now he would n't even call again . Well , tant pis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of her lackeys . " Now , you , tell me about lingerie . I want to be aroused , amused , shocked , delighted , frightened , sent wailing and weeping from rooms , driven to desperate limits , elevated and forced to my knees , canonized and rendered mute . Tell me , girl , tell me . " Marianna smothered a giggle , grabbed her notebook and tote bag , and went out into the market . She wondered whether Tony would call . Winslow flew back to Paris on the 6 P.M. out of Nice . Maggy Moal 's man in Grasse had been helpful , but not all that much . He was a technician , a " modernist , " and full of contempt for the locals , the farmers who produced the attar . " These small holders , monsieur , they are not men of the world , like you and me . They are a difficult breed , suspicious ,  | shrewd , wed to the land . These little farms , many of them in the same family for generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and the regime tried to get them to increase production , there was no reaction . Just a mulish indifference to outside forces , a shrug of the shoulder , and nothing more . " Winslow asked why the Germans , of all people , had wanted flower production increased during their desperate war for survival . " Speer was to blame . Albert Speer . Someone at I. G. Farben or one of those big German chemical complexes had an insane notion they could put our essential oils to industrial use . All nonsense , of course , and it never came to anything . From what I 've read of Speer , he was the only scientist Hitler really trusted and he was always coming up with schemes , some of them sensible , others , like this , crack-brained . " Maggy 's manager paused . " But of course the poor fellow was an architect and not a chemist , though perhaps Hitler did n't distinguish . But , as I say , nothing ever happened , and these farmers of Grasse plodded doltishly on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These fellows " ? he shook his head ? " these fellows are mules . " Winslow absorbed what he was told . Then , just before he got into his car to drive back to Nice , he tried once again . " Have you ever heard the phrase Paris One ' ? " The man thought , ponderously . " Is n't that the central district of Paris ? " The clouds had blown out and Orly was in the clear as the plane came in . Winslow picked up a cab . There was very little traffic on the autoroute . The driver asked his expectations of the elections . Winslow said he thought it would be close . " Next week , then we shall see , " the driver predicted . " Next week ? " " The first of May . The workers will be out . Marching . The city will be truly fucked that day . " " The traffic . " " Sure , " the driver said , " the traffic is always shit when there is  | a parade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both sides . And then , there is the army . Who knows ? " Winslow said he did not understand . The driver was patient . " Look , monsieur , next week , May Day , if there seems to be a big shift toward the Left , with the unions and the workers demonstrating , well , then , will the colonels sit sipping their citron presse or will they call out the paras ' ? " " A coup ? " " Monsieur , " the cab driver said solemnly , " it has occurred before , you know . " When he had gotten into the hotel elevator , the concierge picked up a telephone . " Monsieur Winslow est revenu , " he said , and hung up . The concierge smiled . This was earning fifty francs the easy way . Tony Winslow sat in the bathtub , his knees high and dry , the rest of his long body soaking comfortably . He was reading the Paris Herald-Trib , specifically Red Smith . The Paris Herald-Trib was Winslow 's favorite paper in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead New York Herald-T rib , it had the good features of The Times and the Washington Post , and it was only i6 pages long . Red Smith was writing about some drinkers he had known in the early days of the pro football leagues . Winslow was very happy sitting there in the tub reading Smith and thinking perhaps he should have made himself a drink to go with his cigar and the newspaper and the tub when the phone rang . Goddammit , Winslow thought , as soon as a man gets comfortable .. . The call was from Mme. Claude . She had been able to contact Anouk . The young woman was free that evening . She would phone Winslow within the hour to arrange the rendezvous . Did Monsieur Winslow wish to open an account ? His friends recommended him very highly , and if convenient , he might pay by check or by cash . After he hung up , Winslow stood naked , dripping on the hotel-room rug , a bath towel hanging uselessly over his shoulder . Anouk Fayol ! Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would finally learn something . He ran his  | fingertips over his chin and decided to do that rare thing , to shave a second time in the same day . He remembered the girl vividly . Thirty minutes later she called and they arranged for her to pick him up at the hotel at ten . " I 'm really looking forward to meeting you , " Anouk said in near-perfect English . Her voice had a throaty quality . She sounded very much as if she meant it . Winslow stuffed a wad of hundred-dollar American Express traveler 's checks into a suit jacket hanging in the closet and began to dress .  | Anouk Fayol had a little Lancia and she drove it beautifully . Much better than Paul Delane , Winslow concluded . Even though she drove fast , his feet remained relaxed , not reaching for brake pedals that were n't there . Here and there they passed roving packs of students testing the nerves of the riot police , testing themselves , engaging in dress rehearsals for the obligatory riots of May Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the riot cops , the C.R.S. , had tommy guns slung over their shoulders on leather belts . And there seemed to be more of the big blue buses with mesh over the windows parked in alleys and on quiet corners , full of men in uniform who smoked or slept or talked quietly through the night . Anouk turned to him . " Do you prefer that we speak English or French ? Madame Claude told me your French is very good . " " Ca m'est egal , " Winslow said . " Okay , then , we 'll talk English . I do n't get all that much opportunity . " It was too early to go dancing and Winslow had not eaten , and on Anouk 's suggestion they drove into Les Halles and got a table in the back room of L'Escargot . The girl pulled the little car halfway up onto the sidewalk and they went inside . The place was full of middle-aged men , some with their wives , some with  | ladies who were obviously not their wives . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , and the serious sounds of glasses tinkling , of corks being pulled , of knives and forks on the dinnerware . Winslow noticed , as the girl walked ahead of him , that every man in the restaurant saw her . Not every man acknowledged he had seen her . But he had . Winslow understood why . Anouk Fayol was a very physical girl . As tall as Marianna Troy , and with the same long , dark , heavy hair , the same articulate , graceful movement , the girl turned crossing a room into a minor performance . Winslow wished he could be farther back , to enjoy it better , without the foreshortening of proximity . She wore a long patchwork skirt with a white silk shirt opened one button too low and then knotted at the waist , and a heavy peasant shawl carelessly tossed around her shoulders . Under the skirt was the hint of highly-polished heeled boots . She wore gold chains around her neck and on her wrists . They had no reservation , but that seemed to pose no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall young man and this woman ? They sat side by side on a banquette and Winslow ordered drinks , a vodka martini with olive on the rocks for both of them . " Whatever you drink , I shall drink , " Anouk had told him . " That 's part of the adventure . " When the drinks came they toasted one another and Winslow said , quite casually , " You know , we have met before . " " Oh ? " " At that party in the Bois , last week . You were with Nafredi . " Please , " she said coolly , " I never discuss one client with another . " It was almost as if she were establishing ground rules , reminding the American she was a whore , perhaps reminding herself of the fact at the same time . Winslow let it pass . " But you do n't remember me , " he said . " I remember meeting someone very tall . It must have been you . But I never look at the faces . " Winslow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often the best of people , the most interesting . Anouk looked at  | him , through him , and without being obvious , at his body . " I 'm sure you 're mistaken about that , " she said . Her voice had a sensual hunger in it . Winslow found her not at all what he 'd expected . ' What had he expected ? A spoiled , middle-class brat in rebellion against family and class ; more vaguely , perhaps , against society , convention , religion , whatever . Instead , or maybe for those very reasons , she was being very much the professional ; the tough , sexy hooker ? no fencing , no false modesty , no wanting to be talked into it , and claiming all the while that circumstance was to blame , that she was really pure at heart . He examined her while they drank . The shirt and the peasant skirt exposing a midriff that was lean and brown . He asked her about the tan , this early in the season . Someone had taken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a lot of swimming . Strangely annoyed , Winslow thought of the sleek Iranian and was jealous . " How did you learn your English ? " he asked . " On the job , " she said , again being tough . Then , for the first time , she unbent fractionally . " No , in England . At a boarding school . And your French ? " Winslow told her about his mother . They ordered , had another martini , the dinner came ( disappointed ) , and Winslow made a note to check the Guide Michelin to see whether they were still giving L'Escargot a decent rating . The girl did n't seem to notice the food ; she pushed it around the plate but did n't eat much . He got the check and they went out and she said she preferred Regine 's , and she drove and Albert took the car at the curb of the rue Ponthieu , and when they went inside , Luciano found them a good table . They were on scotch now , and when they danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to get anything out of this girl , he 'd better slow down . She danced well , using her body against his . God , she felt good . That was another thing he 'd better slow down on . Back at the table she sat very close , curling in against him and taking a drag on his cigarillo . It was all very sexy . She was being pliant , suggestive , ripe . Everything you wanted in a call girl . Then he dropped the bomb . " I know who you are , you know . "  | She tensed , then laughed . " Of course you do . I 'm one of Madame Claude 's young women . My name is Anouk . And in another hour or so I will be fucking you . " Nice bluff . He ignored it . " I know who your father was . I 've been to see your mother . I ... " She told him , in French , to do something foul to himself . She kept her voice low : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no masking the intensity of her anger . " What are you , some goddamn tabloid journalist after the dirt ? " she demanded . " No , I really am a banker . We have some dealings with the House of Fayol . I 'm over here looking at papers , trying to track down some deals your father was ... " " Do n't call him my father . ' Call him Fayol , ' whatever . He 's not my father . " Winslow let that pass . " There was a negotiation your .. . Fayol was working on with one of my clients , a big American company . They thought they had an agreement . Then , he died . Now they 're not so sure . They need something more on paper . You understand , do n't you ? You and your mother . . . " " The nun , " she interrupted bitterly . He ignored it . " ... are the heirs . I 've been to see the huissier , seen the files at the bank , talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one seems to ... " She pulled the shawl around her lean shoulders . " I do n't think you want my services , Mr. Winslow . My specialties are of a rather different sort . I think you need an accountant , or a barrister , perhaps . I suck cocks and wear leather underclothes and occasionally permit people to whip me . I used to think these were shameful things . But now I think I 'm in a decent trade . Decent , compared to yours . " It was a hell of a good speech , Winslow admitted that to himself , and a grudging admiration for the girl wormed into his awareness . But now she started to get up . He grabbed her arm , firmly .  | " No , you do n't , " he said . She stared at him angrily . " Do n't worry , " she said , " there 'll be no charge . Obviously I have n't been satisfactory . " " Sit down , " he ordered . When she hesitated he pulled her down onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , we made a bargain , and you 're damn well going to carry out your share of it . " There was hatred in her face . Then , unexpectedly , she took a deep breath and said , quite calmly and in French , " Might I have another drink ? " He started to order two more scotches but she interrupted and said she wanted a " fine " this time . Oh , he thought , so it 's going to be like that . The whore 's tricks were put aside . He ordered and then he began to ask questions . All around them people laughed and danced and flirted and the discs played and he asked questions which she did not answer . Or , rather , she answered , but without telling him anything . Finally he said , " There are several files that seem to be missing . One of them is called the Paris One ' file . Do you know anything about that ? " She shook her head . " I never discussed business with my . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And besides , I have n't spent much time in France recently . I do n't know anybody , and I thought nobody knew me . " Her curiosity made her ask how he had known . " Maggy Moal pointed you out . The night you were with Nafredi . I mean , one of your clients . " She nearly smiled for the first time since he had told her he knew who she was . " Maggy . I should have known . My father and she were lovers once , I suspect . When he was very young and she reigned over the couture . " Winslow noticed the slip . " My father . " Maybe the hate did n't go all that deep . He took advantage of the opening to dig in . " Has n't any of your father 's fashion sense rubbed off on you ? Do n't you care about the couture house ? It 's yours now . " She made a face . " Since I was twelve they 've shunted me from  | one boarding school to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . There was a year in London , the College of Design . Poof ! Fashion . What do I care for it ? I know enough to wear the clothes that suit me . Women obsessed with fashion I find pitiful . Ridiculous ! As for the rest , the money , Max runs the house . He 's capable . I take no interest in it . And " ? she looked down at herself , provocatively ? " I am quite obviously able to earn money in my own line of work . " I 'll just bet you are , Winslow thought . Aloud , trying to get her back on the track , knowing he sounded ponderous , he said : " The files seem incomplete . There are leases , property rights , my client needs to see , there may be a rival claim . There 's so much I do n't know . " She shrugged . " Could n't old Grumbach tell you ? He kept all the Fayol secrets . " " He did n't seem to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't half through it when I saw him . I suppose I 'll go back again this week . Maybe it 'll turn up . " The girl said in a dreamy voice , " Poor old Grumbach . When I was a little girl I 'd see him at the office or he 'd come to the house . Even then he was bent and old and trembling and always with a thousand papers under his arm . He was a good old man . He wrote me when my . . . when Fayol died . " " You mean , condolences , not about the estate ? " " No , just a sweet letter . Some advice my father had once given him for me . Some shit about seeking spiritual guidance , I do n't know . A romantic notion , I suppose , born of guilt . " " How old are you ? " Winslow asked , without knowing why . Now she was again the whore . " How old do you want me to be ? Some men like me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he looked stern she said , " I 'll be twenty in May . " She was only nineteen , Winslow thought . My God , a girl like this . " Is it possible your mother might have some information that could ... ? "  | " My mother ! That wax saint ! A foolish woman without the heart or the mind to understand that a genius like my father will always have flaws , that no man can create the way he did without some wild drive twisting him this way and that , forcing him , torturing him . No ! I despise my father for what he was . But I hate my mother for what she was n't . " Anouk ordered another " fine " and then another and then she excused herself . Winslow let her go , wondering if she would try to slip out . He watched the dancing and sipped at his scotch , and then she came back , very bright now , her eyes shining , and , if possible , even more desirable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , that she wanted to go somewhere else . He got the check and gave Luciano fifty francs and they went outside , the men turning to watch her go , and he gave old Albert ten francs and he limped off at a sprint to get the car . " Should I drive ? " Winslow asked . He noticed she was high . " You can do anything you want , " she said . She was back to the tone of earlier that evening , the pliant whore tone that promised so much . She gave him the directions , and when she told him where to turn on the Avenue Georges Cinq he asked where they were headed and she told him . " The Crazy Horse . Maybe all those Teutonic tits will inspire you. , , Winslow bit back the retort . He could n't blame her for turning nasty , but it was odd how quickly she slid from one mood to another . Watching her face , the lovely green eyes so bright , despite the drink and the smoke and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside , she quickly whispered to him , " Do n't get a table . They rob you . They rob you at the bar too but not so badly . " They wedged into a space at the bar and Winslow looked around . The place was jammed . Up on the stage an absolutely lovely young blonde was dancing . She was naked except for some silly plastic boots . He ordered drinks and they leaned against the bar watching the show . Anouk maneuvered her buttocks back  | against his thighs and moved them slightly . He felt himself hardening . The blonde went off to applause and then two girls came on , and the crowd , most of them foreigners , cheered . Apparently they knew the drill . The two girls undressed to music and then faked a lesbian act . It was very well done . Anouk turned and looked up into his face . " I could phone another girl if you want . If you enjoy that sort of thing . We could ... " " Shut up , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful laugh . " Sleek cows , " she said contemptuously . " Stupid Swedes . " Winslow said impatiently , " This was your idea . Not mine . " " Well , so it was a bad idea . " Then she said something Winslow could n't hear against the noise of the room and the beat of the music . He said " What ? " and she looked into his face and then away . " I started to say I 'm one of them . A bit slimmer , better educated , more intelligent , perhaps . But just like them . " " I do n't think you are . " " Hah ! Do n't delude yourself . We 're all angry at something , we 're all striking back at somebody . If I could dance and had bigger tits , I 'd be up there too . But because I speak languages and have some chic , I fuck rich foreigners like you and Nafredi . But really , I 'm just like those peasants up there . Rebellious , guilty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except to strip or to take drugs or to fuck . " Winslow did n't want any more of this second-rate drunken moralizing . Any more of this and he 'd be handing her his handkerchief and they would both be agreeing that , yes , it was a hard , cruel world and the deck had been stacked against us . He thought of the old Kennedy line , " Life is unfair , " and decided it was time to get out of there . " Come on , " he said . " I 've had enough . " They pushed through the crowd toward the narrow hallway . Anouk was a few paces ahead of him . As Winslow squeezed between the men and a few women queued up at the entrance , someone grabbed his arm .  | " Qu'est-ce que to fais , monsieur ? " Winslow half turned to see a heavyset Frenchman , perhaps a head shorter , holding his arm . Winslow lifted his head and said , " Hein ? " and the man pushed a bulky envelope into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slipped past Winslow into the club . Winslow stood there for a moment and then a tourist behind him said , " For chrissake , pal , let 's move it , " and he shoved the envelope into his pocket and joined Anouk at the curb . The cab drivers at the hack stand were looking her over . She smiled at one of them and the man licked his lips . " Come on , " she said . " Get in the car . " " Look , " Winslow said , " I can get a cab from here . Or walk . " She drove this time . They stopped in front of his hotel . He turned to look at her . " I 'm sorry to have tricked you this way . But I had to ask questions . I hope if you think of something , anything , you 'll let me know . It 's important to me and it could be damned important to you . Quite a bit of money is involved . " She shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He started to get out of the car . She turned the engine off and opened the door on her side . " Wait a minute , " she said . She came around and joined him on the curb . " We have a contract , remember ? " The night concierge leaned down and unlocked the door and they went inside and got into the elevator . The concierge waited until the door had closed and he picked up the telephone . Inside the elevator Anouk leaned against Winslow and lifted her head to kiss him , her mouth moist and slightly opened . Inside the room she dropped the shawl and turned to him . " Do you prefer the lights on or off ? Do you want to undress me or should I . . . ? " " You have to play whore , do n't you ? " " Why not ? " she said . " I am one . " She looked around . " Is that the bathroom ? " He nodded . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober now . He threw his suit jacket on the bed and loosened his tie . Jesus , this is sick . The girl was beautiful , wanton , and he was certain that in bed she would live up to the promise . He wanted her and at the same time was repelled . There was nothing of the well-scrubbed , refreshing sexuality of Marianna Troy about her . With Anouk it would be a dark journey into pleasure . He heard the water running in the sink , the toilet flush . He lighted a cigarillo and then remembered the bulky envelope shoved at him in the entrance to the Crazy Horse Saloon . He ripped it open . There were ten crisp one-thousand-franc notes , about two thousand dollars . And a bit of good notepaper . And a photo torn from that morning 's Le Figaro , a wire service shot of an auto wreck on one of the suburban roads . " Trois morts a 16o KPH , " the headline said . He looked at the notepaper . The typed message , unsigned , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a ticket home . " The notepaper had a scent to it . He sniffed , but with the cigar smoke in his nostrils , it was vague . He wished he knew more about perfumes . Maggy Moal 's man in Grasse had told him about the specialists , the professional " noses " employed in the trade . Perhaps he could have one of them sniff the paper and .. . From inside the bathroom there was the sound of a body falling . He pushed open the door . Anouk Fayol lay on the floor . He picked her up and carried her to the bedroom . She was wearing just the shirt and a pair of bikini underpants , curiously childlike with little yellow daisies on a white field . He wet a hand towel and washed her face with it . She mumbled something he could not understand . Back in the bathroom was her purse . On the shelf she had lined up four tiny mounds of white powder . One of them was diffused , a plastic straw discarded nearby . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went back to examine her again . She was breathing normally . Asleep , he guessed , just asleep . He breathed out , relieved . But he picked up the phone , just to be sure . An hour later Delane 's physician pal had left , assuring Winslow the girl would be fine once she slept it off . He grinned mischievously at the American .  | " I 'm sure she 'll have nothing but a hangover and some pleasant memories , " he said , looking down at Anouk 's long legs and lovely face . Playing his playboy role , Winslow grinned right back . " Wo n't we all ? " the grin seemed to suggest . Now he tidied up the place , hanging her skirt in the closet and flushing the drugs down the toilet . It was cooler now , and he pulled a sheet and blanket up to the girl 's chin . She slept quietly . He thought about the bikini with the daisies . It was apparent Anouk had n't thought him the type for leather underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to review the night 's bidding . Had she said anything at all , anything ? that might unravel the tangle of Fayol 's deal with Delaware ? Just before he drifted into sleep it occurred to him there had been something . Something she had said had struck him as false . But he could n't remember what it was . In the morning when he awoke , Anouk was gone .  | The morning began badly . Anouk had slipped away and the evening gone by without getting the girl to talk seriously about the sale of her father 's business . Worse yet , he still did n't have any direct way of contacting her , just the awkward conduit of Mme. Claude . On top of that , a hangover . And now , a call from the American Embassy . Charlie Casey had called , now the commercial attache and once , years earlier , one of Winslow 's professors at the Harvard Business School . Casey had heard Winslow was in town , they really must get together for a drink , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . " Yes ? " Winslow asked . " Do n't tell me , Tony , if you do n't want to . But we hear you 're in Paris to buy a French company , one of their precious national treasures . ' A year or two ago one of the big American distilleries tried to buy Chateau Margaux , which is just about the most famous vineyard they have . There was hell to pay , I can tell you . The distillers had to pull in their horns and cancel . And now , with an election right around the corner , Giscard is n't about to allow a prestigious Paris fashion house to be sold to the goddamn Yanks . The Opposition would just murder him if he did , and a hell of a lot of Frenchmen are pissed off already about American muscle . You get me ? "  | Winslow did , but he decided to be obtuse . " Charlie , first of all , I may not be buying a damn thing . And secondly , even if the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're supposed to be representing us , not them . " " That 's the rough part of it , Tony . Washington likes Giscard . They do n't want to see the Left win this election . They 've got enough trouble with Italy already . They want Giscard to win  - -  unofficially , of course  --  and Washington does n't want some smart young banker of Henry Rousselot 's coming in here and handing the Socialists and the Communists a tailor-made emotional issue that could lose Giscard some votes . " There was more of this , and then , less businesslike , Casey 's assurances of friendship and a promise to help Winslow in any way he could without breaching Embassy policy . " Thanks , Charlie , I appreciate that , " Winslow said , recognizing his old teacher 's dilemma . " One last thing , Tony . Be careful . Assume you 're under surveillance . The French are damn serious about this election and they can play rough . " None of this helped Winslow 's morning mood . He 'd been moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated by his failure to pin her down on the House of Fayol , irritated by her sluttishness and the drugs . And , he had to admit , the thought of sleeping with her had not been all that repugnant . Instead , the night had produced nothing but the crude bribethreat and the nagging notion Anouk had said something , something quite innocent , that rang false and might possibly be vital . Except that in his stupidity he could not remember what it was . He walked down to the Place de l'Alma for breakfast and to clear his head , and halfway through his brioche he realized there might be a very simple way to trace the origin of the bribe note . He hurried back to the hotel . The shoe designer who was one of the hotel 's permanent residents hopped into the elevator with him just before the door closed . The man was a White Russian . He was very elegant . He tipped his hat . Winslow was cheered .  | Any city where men still tipped their hats to one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delane . " Do you have a nose ' in town ? Someone who can ... " " I know what a nose ' does . The good ones are in Grasse . But I can probably find one . Why ? You gon na start bottling perfume now ? This is a hell of a thing to compete with another Harvard man right here in his own town . " Winslow agreed . " Oh , another thing . Maggy Moal 's secretary called . She 's trying to run you down . Wants you to go to dinner there tonight . " Winslow took down the number . He would leave the piece of scented notepaper in an envelope in Delane 's name . This business of a " nose " was important , to sais ? Delane complained for a moment and then said he would do what he could . " That 's the old school spirit , " Winslow told him , and hung up . Marianna Troy looked very lovely . " It is n't a real Moal , " she said when he remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to it that I can afford . " " And I thought all you fashion editors got your clothes free in exchange for plugs in the magazine . " Marianna laughed . " For a banker you do have the most astounding notions of morality . " They were in a cab , headed for dinner chez Maggy Moal . Marianna had not been laughing when he called . She was quite cool , his silence of the last few days rankling . He had made no excuses ; told her he wanted to see her again and that Madame Moal was giving a small dinner party . He picked her up at eight . She wore a strapless black dress in something Winslow imagined was silk . It clung just ever so . He supposed they designed it that way . She poured a drink , less cool now . By the time they were in the cab she was smiling again . She liked Winslow , she liked him very much , and she realized now how badly she felt when he had n't called since they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel in a small suite that gave on the gardens on the rue Cambon side . But the dinner was in the couture house , just across from the Ritz and perhaps zoo yards from the Maison Fayol . A liveried doorman let them in and directed them to the winding , mirrored staircase . Marianna went up first . Winslow watched the smooth motion of her hips as she climbed the stairs . She looked around at him . " I 've been here . For shows . But never at night . " She looked happy now . There were cocktails first in the sitting room with all the chinoiserie . A waiter in white gloves served . Maggy was very good . She said the right things to Marianna , how pretty she was , how young , how American girls had a freshness so many European women lacked . " Confidentially , " she said , " we do n't wash often enough . It makes a difference . " She screwed up her nose and laughed . The other guest was a middle-aged Frenchman , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslow on her right and Marianna at her left for dinner . The editor played host . Two servants worked the table . They began with vodka and caviar and progressed from there . Marianna was nervous at the start , having seen Maggy from afar but never this close , but the old couturier relaxed her . " What sort of thing do you do ? " she asked , and when Marianna said she worked for Vogue , Maggy launched into a history of fashion magazines dating back to some of the later cave drawings . " Fashion editors are the most pretentious of women , " Maggy declared . " They contribute nothing , they know less , they assume airs , they lack taste , they are rude and unlettered , and most of them have bad legs . " Having delivered this fusillade , she leaned over and put her hand on Marianna 's thigh . " But you , my dear , are exquisite . " The Paris Match editor was gloomy . " This , then , is the scenario for the next fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day the workers are choreographed in the thousands . Someone drinks too much cheap wine and throws a brick at a policeman . The mounted police , anxious to prove themselves anything but anachronistic , charge the marchers . A  | seven-year-old child , all pigtails and blue eyes , will be trampled by a horse , and her mother , a poverty-stricken La Passionaria , will weep for the television cameras . The resulting riot will find a number of policemen being thrown into the Seine and a jittery government will mobilize the reserves . Some colonel in the Camargue , fretting about his pension , will decide this is a marvelous opportunity to reestablish the monarchy and he will march on Paris . Madame Gandhi , who has troubles at home and wishes to divert the world 's gaze , will summon the UN Security Council on grounds a Hindu fakir in the 9th arrondissement has been illegally detained . Forces from all the world 's great powers , including Cuba , the Malagasy Republic , and Zaire , will occupy France , and Giscard will fly to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Resistance during a commercial break in a replay of Upstairs , Downstairs . ' " The editor paused for breath . " It promises to be a splendid season . " He sat back . Winslow knew he was supposed to be amused . But he was n't . Maggy cackled and said the Communists were to blame . " His Majesty tells me . . . " and she went into a long story . Marianna looked puzzled and Winslow whispered , " Her PR man is an exking . " The meal was wonderful . ' When they were on the tarte au pomme Maggy got up and went to the window . With a trembling hand , her cane and a cigarette balanced precariously , she announced : " They watch me . I suppose I 'll be one of the first they shoot . " " Who watches you , ma chere ? " the editor asked , continuing to shovel the tarte into his mouth . " Those bastards out there . ' What did Peron call them ? It was a splendid phrase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shirtless ones . " Maggy turned , dropping ash on the carpet . " Ah , you 're a treasure . Why you work for a filthy scandal sheet I do n't understand . I 'm sure you could get a position on Vogue . " " I 'm sure she could , Maggy , " the editor said smoothly , ignor-  | ing her lapse , " but who is it that watches ? Are they out there now ? " Maggy pushed ineffectually at the curtain . " They 're there . In a car . A Citroen . Nobody drives Citroens anymore but the Left . Suddenly it 's the chic car for the radicals . " Winslow got up and went to the window . " May I ? " he said , and peered out . There was a car , lights off , across the street . He could n't tell if it was empty or not . Maggy gibbered on . " Or it might be that baggage I showed the door last week . My directrice , she called herself . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and shouts obscenities at me . There 's no sense of decency in France since the first war . The gentlemen all died and the women became whores . " She lit another cigarette and blew the smoke up into her brown wig . While the men drank brandy and smoked Havana cigars , Maggy and Marianna disappeared into the depths of the apartment . Winslow did n't like the editor , but he felt he had to make talk and so he asked him about the elections . Without Maggy as an audience , the man dropped the mocking , sophisticated tone and said , quite seriously , that he was worried . " Alarmed ' would be too strong a word . But I worry . We can live with a Front Populaire government . We 've done it before . In the thirties . But I 'm afraid of the Right , of the army , of the pieds noirs who never really forgave democracy for having surrendered Algeria . These things concern me . Not Giscard . He 's an arrogant fellow , intellectually vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , however , men I fail to trust . " Winslow thought for a moment . " Would sale of a French company to foreigners become a campaign issue ? " " It could . Why ? You buying one ? " Winslow laughed . " No , I just wondered . " The editor told the latest oil sheikh story , the one about the Danish girls and the 747 , and they were still laughing when Maggy came back , leaning on Marianna 's arm . " It 's an offense , " she rasped , " that the men save all the really filthy stories for when I 'm out of the room . It 's the only argument  | I share with the feminists , this business of excluding women from the really gamey stuff . I have to settle for old women 's twaddle . Not at all the same thing . " She cackled then and told a story that was far riper than anything the editor or Tony Winslow had told , and when Marianna 's eyes went wide , Maggy put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondly . " My god , she 's incredible , " Marianna said when they were on the street . " How old is she ? Eighty , eighty-five ? " " She liked you , " Winslow said . " Did she not . I thought I 'd never escape from that bathroom of hers . Have you seen it ? The fixtures are solid gold . And she kept wanting me to try on dresses . " Marianna paused . " I think she knew I was n't wearing anything under this . " " Oh ? " They found a cab at the corner of the rue St.-Honore and got in . It was agreed , without having to be spoken , that they would make love . The cab turned right and right again into the rue de Rivoli , and Marianna fell lightly against him . He softened his shoulder but did not try to hold her or to kiss in the back of the cab . Once he glanced out of the rear window . There were cars following , but it was impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take them to the hotel . Somehow , it seemed the right thing to do : the first time in her apartment , the second in his bed . There was no mincing , no coquettishness . She leaned against his shoulder and looked happy . It was still before midnight and they passed some students , not demonstrating but simply hanging around , bunches of them on the street corners , watched warily by the riot cops . Both sides seemed to be marking a truce . The doors of the hotel had not yet been locked and they went inside . The fat concierge said bon soir and dove down into the pigeonholes to come up with a batch of messages . Winslow thanked him and jammed them into his coat pocket . He watched to see if the concierge smirked , but the man sensed his dislike and busied himself with meaningless paper shuffling , not looking at them . In the elevator Marianna kissed him . It was the first time since the night they made love . She  | tasted clean and fresh . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , in the same room , neither staring at one another nor looking away . There was none of the teasing of Anouk . But it was infinitely more seductive . Winslow turned off the lights and opened the French windows . A soft light from the streetlamps and the other buildings flowed into the room . He threw down the bed covers . Marianna came over and kissed him . They stood , two tall , lean bodies pressed together . Then they fell into bed . During the night Winslow woke . Marianna was lying next to him , on her back , looking at the ceiling and smoking a Gitane . " Ca n't sleep ? " he asked . " Do n't want to , " she said . " It 's a good night . I want to think about it for a while . I do n't want it to drift away while I sleep . " He reached over and put his hand on her breast . She drew smoke into her lungs and then snuffed out the cigarette and they made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was gone . But printed neatly on the bathroom mirror in lipstick she put this message : " Do n't just vanish again . Please ? M. " He went back to the correspondent bank during the morning and went through the files again . This time he had more of a sense of what he was looking for , something to do with Grasse , with perfume , with a missing file that might be called Paris One . ' Or again , and he scratched his head , it might not . He lunched alone in a bistrot , reading the Paris Herald-Trib and noting with perverse pleasure that Bill Bradley had scored only eight points in the Knicks ' first playoff game . He dropped by Rizzoli , the bookstore , and bought Kaufman 's massive book on perfumes . A coffee-table book . In fact , damn near a coffee table itself . He hoped they 'd buy it back used , once he was through with it . At three he talked to Delane . The designer was ecstatic . " Aha , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our faculty at Harvard . " " Yes ? "  | " Yes , and again , yes ! My nose ' has done his work . Ah , what a magnificent thing is the human olfactory system . How subtle . Did you know , Cher Antoine , that each of the tiny hairs within the nostril has the capacity to ... ? " " Merde . What did you find out ? " Delane sounded injured . " I have n't quite completed my treatise on the nasal mechanism , " he said . What it came down to was , the scent was a new one , not yet marketed , but one that various " noses " had been called in to sniff . It was a pleasant , light scent , lavender-based , with low musk content , and would be priced to reach the market at , oh , say thirty dollars an ounce ? Winslow restrained himself . " And who plans to market this wonder ? " he asked quite calmly . " Oh , " Delane said , " the Maison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek bastard ! Winslow said to himself . To Delane he said , " Now we can nail it down through the notepaper itself . We can ... " " Attends , mon vieux , " Delane protested . " I find you a nose . ' In Paris , for me , that is not so difficult . But now , to find a man who can analyze notepaper ... ? " " No , " Winslow said , not to analyze , " to compare it with other paper . I 'm sure this damnfool note came from Max . Just get hold of a letter from Max , compare it to ... " " I know I should be hurt , " Delane said , " but Max very rarely writes little notes to me . Almost never . " " That trade association you belong to , the Chambre Syndicale , would n't they have a file of letters from members ? Max is director of the house . Surely he 'd have had occasion to write a note , query something ? " " I hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it , a trade association . ' But , yes , you are perhaps right . " " Then get over there and .. . " Winslow said . " Oui , mon capitaine , " Delane said , and hung up . About seven that evening he phoned Winslow at the hotel and said , yes , it was the same paper . There were several letters from Max to the Chambre on the same stationery .  | " What do you do now ? " Winslow had been thinking about that . " Better you do n't know , Paul , but if the cops call , tell them it was evil companions led me astray . " The couture houses would be closed by now , or nearly so . He would give it another hour , then he would drop in to see M. Max . Without an invitation . He went up in the same elevator as before . The Maison de Couture was still and empty . He got off a floor below this time . He walked through a door , another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready for the cutting . There was the musky smell of animal hair . The bright overhead lights were out , just a shaded work light or two to show the way . He found the back stairs , wooden , worn , no linoleum even . Moving as quietly as he could , he climbed to the next floor . Here everything was deeply , lushly carpeted . He passed several doors until he came to a double door , heavily padded with leather , studded with decorative nailheads . Winslow put his car to the door . He thought there was some sound from the other side , music perhaps , low and indistinct . Inside that door there was another door , and now the sounds were quite distinct , music playing  --  something synthesized , very contemporary  --  and other sounds : a girl 's voice and a man 's . That surprised him and he stopped . What the hell do you do when you 've broken into someone 's house and get to his bedroom door and you expect to find him alone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead he 's in bed with a girl ? Winslow knocked . " What the devil ! " someone said in French . It did n't sound like Max . " Who 's there ? " Definitely Max . " Winslow . Anthony Winslow . I 've got to see you . " There was some low talk inside and a girl 's laughter . Then Max said to wait a moment , he would be right out . Winslow backed away from the bedroom door and sat down in a leather armchair . This was awkward as hell . He hoped Delane 's  | " nose " was right and that there 'd been no mistake about the notepaper . In a moment Max came out , tying a navy robe that suggested Sulka , and looking cross . His hair was slicked back . Despite his bedmate . " I 'll have to ask you the meaning of this , " Max said . Winslow considered for a moment being apologetic . Then rejected the notion . It was this son of a bitch who 'd sent that fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lousy ten thousand francs . " I carne to ask about that silly note you sent me . The note and the newspaper clipping and the money . " Max 's eyes went huge . His face was pale . " I do n't know what you 're saying . I ... " Max lied badly . Or , more properly , he lied badly when he 'd been caught . Winslow waved the note in front of him . " Your notepaper . I 've checked it with scent all over it , that new fragrance you 're testing that is n't yet on the market . I know it all . The bills themselves were traced . Bankers have ways , you know . " Winslow was rather enjoying laying it on now . " I swear to you , Winslow . On my ... " " Shit , " Winslow said . He got up out of the chair . He got up simply because he did n't like looking up at the miserable Max . But the Frenchman , thinking Winslow about to attack him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms facing Winslow . " Of course I 'll cooperate . " Winslow mimicked him . " Of course you will . " Max shrugged . " D'accord , I sent it . Is that what you want me to say ? " " I want to know why . Why you want me to disappear , " Winslow said . " I assure you I ... " Winslow erupted . For the first time since he left New York he had become angry . Being tailed by mysterious thugs , adrift in a sea of tantalizing leads that led nowhere , now this perfumed  | dandy offending him doubly with bribes and threats . He reached out a long , sinewy arm and grabbed the lapels of Max 's dressing gown . " Goddamn you ... " Max pulled back and brought up his hands as if to cover his face . " Please , do n't . Do n't hit me . " He began to whimper . Winslow pulled him closer . " Then tell me what this shit is all about . " Max stopped blubbering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as director of the house of Fayol . If the house remained in the hands of Anouk Fayol , he was confident she would permit him to run it . If it were sold , his position would be in danger . He was desperate . He thought if he could get Winslow to give up his quest and go home , even temporarily , he could solidify his directorship , negotiate a long-term contract , so that whatever happened he 'd be secure . Winslow nodded . It sounded plausible . Max was too frightened to lie , especially face to face like this . It rang true . Having Max in a talkative mood , he pressed the questioning . " What about Grasse ? What the hell 's going on down there ? What 's this Paris One ' file Grumbach ca n't find ? " Max started to whimper again . " I do n't know . Fayol had something going on . He did n't tell me . There was something . But I do n't know . He ... " Winslow cut in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all I know . And you mean he did n't tell you ? You were director of his couture house and he kept you in the dark ? Do n't pull that on me , Max . " Max pulled himself free from Winslow 's relaxed grip , straightened his lapels , and tried to regain his composure . " There were a lot of things he did n't tell me . A lot of nasty work he did n't talk about to anyone . Like what he did during the war . With the Germans . " He saw the disgusted look on Winslow 's face and said hurriedly , " And do n't tie me into that . I was five years old when Paris was liberated . " And you were a bastard even then , Winslow thought .  | " Fayol would drop a hint occasionally , something about screwing Maggy Moal and Patou and Dior and everyone else . He 'd have them all by the balls one day . He used to laugh over it . We 're all fashion geniuses , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make the big score . " ' " He used to say that , did he ? " Max nodded . " Not very loyal to your old boss , are you ? " Max 's whine turned bitter . " You think he 's so great . Everyone thought he was so wonderful , so eccentric , so charming . Well , let me tell you . It was n't just being in bed with the Germans . It was , well , it was a lot of things . The way he ate , the way he drank . Gorging himself . The fat pig ! Leaving the house to the girl without taking care of me . And sex ! Men , women , boys , girls . Anything . Everything . You think you know something about sex ? Until you knew Jacques Fayol you did n't know anything . Every day a new boy . A new girl . Take that filthy little Arab boy in Marrakesh . Do you think it was pleasant for me to sit there in the cafe while he ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died ? " Max made an effort to calm himself . " Just do n't be too sure , Monsieur Winslow , that Jacques Fayol died of overeating . " " What do you mean by that ? " " Just what I said . I ca n't prove it . I ca n't prove anything . But Fayol was playing a nasty game , and there were people who hated his guts . That Arab boy , he could have been sent to lure him away and .. . " Winslow sat down again . " Tell me about the Arab boy , Max , " he said quietly . The two men spoke for another fifteen minutes . Winslow took notes . Max was calm now , self-image at least partially restored . He puffed on an exotic cigarette holder . When they were nearly finished the door to his bedroom opened . Winslow looked up . It was Soroya , the Iranian mannequin . She looked as good as she had the first time he 'd seen her . Perhaps better . This time she  | was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain around her waist . " Hello , " she said . Winslow said hello . " Are you going to be much longer ? " " No . " " That 's good . Max , we 're waiting . We have n't finished , you know . " She turned and went back inside . Through the open door Winslow could see a large bed with a red satin headboard . A blond young man was sitting up in bed , smoking a joint . The girl went back to the bed and climbed in . The young man handed her the joint . Winslow got up . " No more notes , Max , " he said . The fashion director laughed , nervously . " Of course not . " Winslow left . Back in the bedroom Max took off his robe . " Soroya , remember his face . I might want you to be nice to him . " The girl smiled . " Yes , Max . " Max got into bed next to the young man . They resumed .  | The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was before the 1939 war . Deauville was chill and damp , but it was convenient , only a hundred miles from Paris . After the war , with the regular air service to Nice , the Cote d'Azur became the place . In the sixties St.-Tropez enjoyed a brief vogue . Today , with the fast jet buses , the designers and the other fashionable people escape the rain and the cold and the gray skies of Paris in Marrakesh . Marrakesh is a big , neat , high , desert walled-city in the interior of Morocco . The flying time from Paris , direct , is just under two hours . Anthony Winslow took the eight o'clock plane out of Charles de Gaulle airport Wednesday morning . He had waked Charlie Casey at home the night before . Casey was still feeling guilty about parroting embassy policy . He promised to call a pal , the acting consul , to help smooth Winslow 's path in Marrakesh . " Savio 's a good man , Tony . Just for God 's sake keep everything unofficial . " Winslow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , Tony , I 'm just the goddamned commercial attache . Not E. Howard Hunt . " Savio , the American acting-consul , greeted him at the airport . He was a plump little man , balding , damp even in the dry heat , and he drove an air-conditioned five-year-old Ford station  | wagon . " We have eight kids . You ever try to get eight kids in a Ferrari ? " Winslow liked him . " Charlie told me to keep this strictly unofficial . Tell me what I can do for you . But do n't tell me why . When the inevitable congressional investigation takes place a year from now I want to be as uninformed as I sound . " Winslow wanted to interview the police official who handled the investigation of Fayol 's death , the doctor , the people at the cafe where he took his last meal , " and some Arab boy he picked up . " Savio roared . " Some Arab boy ? " He shook his head . " Mr. Winslow , there are maybe 200,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sell themselves to rich , fat foreign pederasts for fifty cents an hour . How many Arab boys do you want ? I can get them wholesale . The local A &P; is running a special . " On the highway from the airport to the town , Savio drove at , perhaps , eighty miles an hour . And he was in the slow lane . " What the hell , " Savio said , " you hit a camel , you hit a donkey . Peasants you are n't supposed to hit . It makes a mess on the fenders and corrodes your radiator . Back home , if I drove fifty miles an hour I knew I was drunk . " Winslow had never been to Africa . He stared out of the window at the robed women , the occasional farmer working a field , the palm trees , the snow-covered mountains off in the distance . " The Atlases , " Savio said . " Beautiful . Little villages up there have n't changed since the Third Crusade . " " They come through here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through here . Once . " The police officer was cooperative . But not very helpful . He told Winslow he had not himself seen the body but had read the medical report and the transcripts of questions put to , among others , le beau Max . " What about this Arab boy ? " Winslow asked . The cop threw up his hands . " Monsieur Winslow , there are Arab boys and Arab boys . We questioned those at the cafe . Some remembered a boy , vaguely , others did not . The quartier is rife with ragamuffins . Did the unfortunate M. Fayol effect a liaison with one of them ? Only he , or Allah , might enlighten us.  | I 've said over and over again , and now most recently to you , we consider this death by natural causes . ' Had there been something suspicious , we would of course have followed it up . " Winslow thought for a moment . " Over and over again ? You mean , someone else has inquired ? " The policeman looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . The dead man was rather famous , I 'm told . And the French consulate . And .. . well , you know , the idly curious . " " Of course . " Savio drove him to the cafe . En route Winslow asked , " Do you have any graft in the police department here ? " Savio shrugged . " Sometimes . " " See if you can find out who else has been asking questions about Fayol . I do n't mean the newspapers or the French authorities . Private parties , commercial interests . " " Okay , " said Savio . He pulled the Ford up in front of a cafe . " This is supposed to be picturesque , you know , for the tourists . So if a cockroach finds its way into your coffee cup , please understand , this is local color , and unless you mention it , there will be no additional charge . " They went inside . It was just noon and the hot sun beat down . The cool gloom of the cafe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Winslow said doubtfully . Savio made an apologetic gesture . " Look , it 's noon . Give it time to develop . At midnight , you know , it 's better . " Winslow looked around the room , his eyes now accustomed to the darkness . A half dozen old men were drinking sweet coffee . A fat waiter , wearing a red sash with gravy spots , worked the tables . There was n't a woman in the place . There was n't a nubile Arab boy . There were senior citizen homes in New Hampshire , run by nuns , that promised more . Savio was very embarrassed . Casey had told him Winslow was an important man , that his errand was substantial . He had made Savio swear to watch over young Winslow in this evil garden of  | delights . And now Winslow was yawning . It reflected badly on Savio , on the consulate , on the entire American presence . " Listen , " Savio said , " there are other cafes . There are districts in this town you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abduction and subsequent gang rape of English schoolmarms . " " Ummm , " Winslow said . He did n't seem impressed . Savio got the proprietor over and a few coins changed hands . The proprietor waved his hands , stroked his beard , and looked sage . Winslow waited patiently , not understanding the language . Finally the old man shuffled away , muttering runic wisdom . " What 'd he say ? " " He was n't here that night , " Savio said . " That was the night man . " Savio took Winslow to lunch at the Anglo Club . They ate on a marble terrace overlooking a swimming pool . Savio had invited one of the local gentry to join them . " Name of Wa'Hoosh . Means The Wolf . ' Ferocious character . Knows damn all about everything . Desperado of the worse sort . You 'll like him . " " What is he , some bandit ? " " Why , yes , I suppose he is , " Savio said . " He sells antiques . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall iced drinks in glasses beaded with sweat . Lean tanned kids frolicked in the pool . Savio watched the teenaged girls . " My God , " Winslow said , " how hot does it get ? " Savio smiled . " In the summer , pretty warm . Right now , oh , in the nineties . But the sun can be a problem . " Winslow mopped his face . Abdul Wa'Hoosh wore a seersucker suit from Brooks Brothers and a rep tie and buttoned-down shirt . They went very nicely with his fez . " Permit me to order , " he said . " Foreigners never know what to order . " The waiter came over and took notes . Abdul Wa'Hoosh ordered Caesar salads and rare lamb chops . " It 's like Athens , " he said , " you eat the lamb , the poultry , and the fish but stay away from the beef . It 's usually horse . Or camel . "  | Savio spun some tale that explained Winslow 's presence and Winslow took it from there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an airline or two , developers . I 'm told Marrakesh is at the same stage now that Acapulco was fifteen years ago . Are n't the fashion designers , people like that , taking it up ? " Wa'Hoosh nodded enthusiastically . " The most chic people in the world are flocking here , Mr. Winslow . I can tell you that , and without being contradicted . Mind you , I have a vested interest . But I also revere objective truth . Some of the smartest people anywhere come to Marrakesh these days . They buy houses . They rent apartments . The climate , the scenery , the cheap labor , the low prices . Ah , if I did n't live here I 'd live here . " Had n't one of the chic people died here recently ? Winslow inquired innocently . Abdul Wa'Hoosh threw up his hands . " Quel tragedie , " he said . " Jacques Fayol . One of my closest friends . A loss to mankind . But what is life ? A scratch on the blackboard of infinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ? " said Winslow , " you were close ? " " Like brothers , " Abdul Wa'Hoosh declared . Then , with Savio looking at him through skeptical eyes : " Well , I met him a couple of times . " Winslow shook his head sadly . " The poor man . " Savio got into the act . " A genius , " he said piously . Abdul bowed his head . " He had high blood pressure , " Winslow said . " He ate too much , " said Savio . Abdul Wa'Hoosh , the Wolf , smiled . " Well , of course , if that 's what the family is saying ... " His voice rose , doubtfully . Winslow took the cue , leaned toward him . " You mean , that was n't the cause ? " Abdul gave a short laugh , like a bark . " My dear fellow , among men of substance like ourselves , need one accept as truth every innocent little falsehood ? " Winslow shook his head . He looked toward Savio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among men such as we . "  | Abdul Wa'Hoosh became very cozy . In a confidential tone he said , " I have information that says his death was , well , that it was not high blood pressure . " " No ! " Winslow said . " But yes , " Abdul said . " There were other people about . A young man from Paris . A young Arab lad . A boy of surpassing beauty , I am told . A boy of the most intricate of tastes . You get my meaning ? " Winslow nodded . " Mind you , " said Abdul the Wolf , " one hesitates to speak ill of the dead . " " Of course , " Savio said , " but try . " The salads came and another round of tall drinks . Abdul said he usually avoided alcohol , " for religious reasons , " but he would make an exception . The salads were excellent . Winslow complimented Abdul . " They manure them with human excrement , " he said , " which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate aside and drank for a while . Wa ' - Hoosh explained that his first name , Abdul , was a very common name in Morocco . " As common as Joe ' in an English-speaking country . So my name is really not all that exotic . Joe the Wolf , ' as simple as that . " Savio suggested that Joe the Wolf tell them more about Fayol . " You see that man over there , under the green-and-white striped umbrella ? " Abdul asked . They nodded . " That is a very important artist from Paris . Those people with him ? Very rich collectors . That man has a house here , lovely house . Fayol had a house . A little jewel box with a courtyard and a small pool . Fountains . Wonderful marble . Well , my point is , this town has been discovered . Painters , sculptors , not the ones starving in garrets but the ones who sell at Galerie Maeght in Paris , at Parke Bernet , at Felix Vercel in New York . What do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious rooms with high ceilings , light . What an artist wants . So they come here because it is pleasant . " He paused . " To work and to relax . " He held up a finger . " Then , there is another reason . They  | come , some of them  --  and I fear we must include the late Fayol ? they come to indulge their weaknesses , if you care to pass judgment , to amuse themselves , to satisfy themselves in ways not as readily available , or as economical , in Paris or London or New York . They come here to purchase boys . "  | Joe the Wolf beckoned a waiter with a languid wave . Winslow noticed that there were no wasted motions . In this climate , in this heat , exertion cost you . Another round of drinks was ordered and Wa'Hoosh suggested they try the local cigars , which he claimed had nearly achieved parity with the good Havanas . The three men sat smoking , sipping their drinks , and watching the children and the teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent finished their lunches and drank coffee or cool ades under their umbrellas . " As I say , " Abdul Wa'Hoosh continued , " they come here to buy boys . Not literally , of course , not anymore , though there was a time not too many years ago when a flourishing traffic existed . And it is not that our women , our young girls , are any more virtuous than their counterparts in Europe . Or the boys less virtuous . It is simply that , as with the fig and the date , we have discovered a plentiful commodity , locally grown , that satisfies a growing demand on the world market . Sex , " said Abdul , " may well be our single greatest invisible export . " Having pleased himself with the aphorism , he went on . " There is the trade in unnatural sex , of course , between older , usually foreign , men , and our home-grown boys . But it would be a mistake to assume this commerce to be totally homosexual . There are women who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the great cities of the  | western world , to taste the local pleasures . I know a titled lady from Kensington who spends a month here every winter . She has a charming flat , with a private entrance , over near the market district , where she rarely if ever rises from bed for four weeks . An industrious and tasteful merchant of the quartier keeps her supplied with teenaged boys who mount the stairs to her apartment one after the other , and subsequently mount the titled lady . She pays handsomely , presumably the boys enjoy their work , and the lady returns to London and to her set in Kensington after the month , refreshed , sated , and positively blooming . That " ? and he shrugged ? " is of course one of more traditional of our visitors . Not everyone who comes here is quite so establishment ' in his or her sexual activities . While the titled lady is entertained by these young boys seriatim , ' there is another woman I know , the wife of a big man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual tableaux . Her local procurer is under instructions always to provide never less than three , and often as many as six , boys simultaneously . The lady in question may go for a week without indulging herself , but when she does so , it is an extraordinary business . I myself have seen some photographs she has commissioned to be taken during the act , and I can tell you , messieurs , the woman 's athleticism is quite wondrous to behold . " Winslow was feeling the drinks and the heat , and he could have sat listening to this born storyteller for hours , but this was getting him no closer to the death of Fayol . He nudged Savio , who was dragging lazily on the cigar and enjoying Abdul . " This is all most enlightening , " Winslow said , " but I am still curious about Jacques Fayol . Did he deal with one of these procurers ? Was the boy he was with that night he died sent him by someone ? Or did he simply pick up the ... ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming to that . With Fayol , the situation was somewhat different . And more complicated . He had these young men who accompanied him from Paris ? I think he referred to them as his little monks ' ? men who worked in the couture house . The last of them , and the most  | important , was this fellow Max who was here with him on the final trip . It was not a straightforward arrangement , the sort of thing I described with the Englishwoman or the wife of the diamond merchant . For one thing , Fayol owned the house here and maintained a full-time staff of servants , including a number of young Arab boys . For another , there were apparently some rather complex sexual and emotional relationships between the various little monks ' and Fayol himself . Occasionally outside talent would be recruited , of course , and then , to muddy the waters further , Fayol still enjoyed the occasional girl . They used to come down with him from Paris ; very chic tall girls with long blond hair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madonnas in pictures by lesser Renaissance Italians ; the impulse purchase , so to speak , some strapping American college girl with tennis shoulders and a peeling nose and a yen for experimentation . Drugs entered into the situation , surely  --  they are always at hand here in Marrakesh  --  and one assumes the girls who attended his parties quite frequently were there for hash or cocaine and stayed on for the sex . So with Fayol , it is difficult to say . " This boy , this Arab kid of the last night , would it be possible to find him ? " Abdul Wa'Hoosh looked at Winslow as if he were a retarded child to be humored . " It is possible , naturally . It is also possible a snow storm will come down out of the Atlas mountains this afternoon . But it is not likely . " Savio apparently had Abdul on a retainer for the day . Leaving the Anglo Club , the three men visited the hospital and by a stroke of luck spoke to the physician who had signed the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could the death have been " not natural " ? Winslow wanted to know . " When the police bring in a man in the small hours of the morning who has been found dying on his doorstep , you immediately look into the possibility , " the physician admitted . " And there were bruises . On the right arm , on both knees , and on the  | temple . Also his lips were badly split and a tooth broken . But these marks , these injuries , were not at all inconsistent with what would be suffered in a fall . The man was , you are aware , a huge person , weighing some 135 or 140 kilos . Falling onto tile , with that weight , would cause abrasions of this sort . " " And you performed an autopsy ? " " But of course . A foreigner , a well-known person , no witnesses ? One must . " " And ... ? " " Stroke . Not immediately fatal . The man lived for an hour or less . The classic symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged . Drink , naturally . Arteries slightly clogged . But the heart , huge , powerful , a faithful pump to the end . It was the brain that killed him . " Winslow had hoped to fly back to Paris that evening . Obviously , that was impossible . He had learned nothing . Savio drove him to a tourist hotel and arranged a. room . It was now four o'clock . Winslow would try to nap . Abdul Wa'Hoosh would meet him at ten that evening in the Cafe de Paris , Fayol 's last bistrot . Savio would have to come along later . " Unfortunately , I 'm spoken for in the early evening . Members of the consulate are putting on a performance of Hello , Dolly . I play Horace Vandergelder . " He looked slightly embarrassed , and Winslow began to understand why , as a senior diplomat , he was still only the " acting " consul . Winslow showered and tried to sleep . Even in the air-conditioned , darkened room , he imagined he could feel the heat ; imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , the back of his neck . After a while he got up , tied a towel around his waist , ordered room service to send up some beer on ice , and he threw open the curtains so he could watch the mountains . He had a copy of the Saturday Review in his Vuitton case and he pulled it out . There was a wonderful critique of western movies by an Oxford don who attacked them as both racist and sexist . " There are very few women portrayed as leaders , " the don complained , " and you almost never find a Puerto Rican or an Oriental in the famed Seventh Cavalry . "  | The beer came and he drank one bottle and half of the second , and between the beer and the Saturday Review he was sufficiently tranquilized to be able to nap until the desk woke him at nine . At midday the Cafe de Paris had been seedy , artificial , and dull . By night it was seedy , artificial , and electric . Joe the Wolf had a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiters and performers , such as they were . He smiled a greeting to Winslow . The banker wondered what all these smiles were costing Savio . And how he was supposed to get Savio to accept repayment . Maybe it came under the heading " contingency funds " in the State Department appropriations bill . A zaftig young woman did a dance involving several veils and a tambourine . The various sheikhs and tourists at the tables sipped their coffee and their cognac and restrained their excitement . Then a slender boy , utilizing fewer veils , came out and did the same dance . The place began to move . " One can not term it a first-class nightclub , " said Abdul Wa'Hoosh , " but among the second-class clubs it certainly is near the top . " Winslow drank scotch with Perrier and Abdul ordered CocaColas with Pernod on the side . Just before midnight there was movement between the tables as , apparently on cue , a number of young boys entered the place and began to circulate . Abdul raised his eyebrows as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It reminded Winslow of Elaine 's in New York , where the Irish kids with homemade haircuts come in to peddle the bulldog edition of the Daily News . Here the kids were selling something else . Abdul shooed away the first two or three who came by until Winslow held his arm . " Let 's talk to one of them , " he said . The next kid they told to sit down , and the boy ordered a diet cola . " If they get fat , " Abdul explained , " only the specialists will buy . " The boy said his name was Aziz . He had an incredible face . Winslow pictured the face framed with longer , softer hair , and he could see Isabelle Adjani . The boy wore tight , faded jeans and a white tennis shirt with the Lacoste crocodile . His skin was more golden than tan . He spoke slangy French . They chatted for a  | while and then Winslow asked if he worked the Cafe de Paris every night . Not every night , Aziz said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been to Tangier just last month with a client . They had stayed in a wonderful hotel , very luxe , of very grand standing . But what of mid-April  --  around the 15th , the 16th  --  was it possible he had been around during that week ? Aziz calculated . He was a shrewd little bastard . He calculated some more . He would try to recall , he told Winslow , but it was so long ago . Perhaps if monsieur could tell him why those dates were of importance his memory would function better . Winslow passed him a fifty-franc note . Aziz ' lovely brown eyes narrowed . He would think hard , he promised . Very hard . " There was a Frenchman here on several of those nights , " Winslow began . " Later he became ill and had gone to the hospital . A young boy had been with him here , with the older man and another . The boy had gone off with the older man . In consequence of the boy 's kindness , the friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reward him . " " Is the older man dead ? " Aziz asked . Winslow was unsure whether the question was knowledgeable or simply a skeptic 's quest for detail . " The older man is very sick , " he lied . " Perhaps he may die , as men do . Perhaps a large amount of money is involved for the boy who was so kind , so thoughtful . " Aziz remained blank . Could the older man be described more precisely ? Winslow told him how Fayol looked , how Max looked . The boy screwed up his face . " I rather fancy the second over the first , " he said . " Those fat ones , sometimes they injure you . " That at least had the ring of honesty , and Winslow pushed another fifty francs at the boy . Stay with us , he said , and think about it . Perhaps one of the other boys is the one . You can help us by pointing him out . Of course , Aziz said , it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went behind a beaded curtain and picked up . It was Savio . " The audience loved it , " he said . " Three curtain calls for  | Dolly , two for me . I ca n't tell you how fulfilled it makes one feel . All those rehearsals in the heat , all those hours . And now , one understands the pull of the theater . " Winslow agreed , it must be a splendid feeling . " Look , " Savio said , " there 's a small party going on . For the cast . I 'll come over if you need me , but I really hate to miss out on this . It 's , well , unless you 've been on the stage you probably would n't . . . " Winslow told him to enjoy the party . " Joe the Wolf and I have the situation well in hand . I 'll phone in the morning . " When he went back to the table there was a second boy . " He is n't the one , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed excited , as if for the first time caught up in the chase . The boy nodded . " I remember the fat one . He came here sometimes . Sometimes with women ( he looked slightly disapproving ) , sometimes with other men , like the handsome one ( Max ) . The last time I saw him , a fortnight ago , he invited a boy called Hassan to the table . Then they went off . I 'm not sure if Hassan went with them . I assume so . " " Have you seen Hassan since ? " No , the boy said , but he himself had been out of town . A German , a very distinguished man in the electronics business , tres gentil , had taken him on holiday . If Hassan had been around he would not necessarily know it . Did the boy know where Hassan lived ? Of course , he said , but ( with a shy smile and lowered eyelids ) surely it was not necessary to make a tiring journey across town in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aziz , could provide whatever services were .. . Winslow told Abdul to remain in the cafe until he heard from him . " Keep asking questions . This may be nothing . If I find the boy , I 'll bring him back . If I do n't , I 'll call you here . We can meet with Savio for breakfast . " Joe the Wolf nodded . He was quite comfortable at the table and Aziz had been making sidelong glances . Winslow hoped they 'd be very happy . There was a cab rank just outside the Cafe de Paris , and the boy gave an address and got in first , as if he were the woman . Winslow tried to keep track of the turnings in case he wanted to come back again , alone . They stopped in front of an apartment building and Win-  | slow gave the cabbie some money and promised an extra tip if he would wait . The driver said that would be possible , but if monsieur could pay a small advance on the tip , the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him another ten francs . The building was one of those hideous modern blocks , institutionalized boredom relieved by little boxed terraces . They went inside and climbed the stairs to the second floor . The boy knocked and a woman came to the door . She was sleepy , annoyed . No , Hassan was not there . He did n't live there any longer . Winslow tried to ask more questions but the woman pushed the door shut . He knocked again and the woman shouted something he did n't understand through the door . He lighted a cigar and wondered what to do next . When he looked around his guide had disappeared . When he came out onto the sidewalk the taxi was gone . Winslow jerked his necktie open in annoyance . A goddamn false lead . Which was okay . You do n't expect everything to be tidy when you go looking for a teenaged homosexual in the middle of the night in North Africa . But it was a pain in the ass to be led up the garden path like this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around him the night was still . A light breeze had come down off the mountains and the stones of the old town had begun to cool . Winslow started to walk , glancing over his shoulder whenever a car went by , watching for a cruising cab . He could hear his footsteps echoing on the stones . Except for them , everything was quiet . This surprised Winslow . He would have expected an African night to be full of sound . Somewhere a shutter slammed . A car rolled past . He crossed from a narrow street into a broader . Several blocks ahead he could see a boulevard of some sort , cars passing , a cruising cab . He was not sure of the direction , either back to the Cafe de Paris or to his hotel , but when he reached the boulevard it would be all right , he would ask directions , stop a cab . The shops he passed were shuttered with the big steel " volets . " The apartment buildings dark , the streetlamps and a sliver of moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His long legs carried him toward the lighted boulevard . He wondered if he should go back to the Cafe and Joe the Wolf , or call Savio at home . He laughed to himself . What a mixed bag they were : a merchant banker , an antique dealer-cumscandalmonger , and an acting consul out of a little theater group . If Delaware Corp . could see them  --  an $85 million deal in the balance and this ill-gotten crew blundering around North Africa handing out tips to fairies and getting lost in the native quarter . Wilmington would shit . Just then he heard footsteps . " Monsieur ? " Winslow froze . A man had come out of the building just ahead of him . An Arab , complete with robes . Winslow started to move again , edging toward the gutter so as to pass the man at distance . " Monsieur . " Winslow stepped into the street . He was abreast of the man now . He glanced to his left . The way was clear . Nobody else there . " Monsieur ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed . He was in the street and the man was edging crabwise across the sidewalk toward him . " Oui ? " Winslow said , trying to keep his voice steady . " Puis-je vous aider ? " He could still hear the footsteps , behind him , coming on . " Non , je vais bien . " The Arab 's hand moved toward his robe . Winslow decided then . He leaped at the man , reaching him in two steps . The Arab 's hand was inside the robe now and starting to reappear . Winslow knew there would be something in that hand . Without plan , without thinking , Winslow swung one arm horizontally to catch the Arab across the face . Instantly , he brought up the other arm , the palm flattened into a knife edge , and slashed down at the man 's shoulder . He heard the crack of bone and a scream simultaneously . The Arab staggered ; reeled toward the building wall . Winslow started to follow him . Then he heard a door open nearby and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footsteps and the whimpering of the injured man . In  | another hundred yards he had reached the boulevard . He pulled his necktie closed , ran a hand through his hair , and walked briskly until a cab rolled up and he got in . It was four o'clock in the morning . Winslow sat on his bed , still dressed . His right hand had already begun to purple . It hurt like hell . He must have broken that son of a bitch 's collarbone . He looked at the hand . Angry-red and fast going darker along the outer edge , the killing edge . Jesus , he 'd never hit a man like that before . He noticed the hand was shaking . He laughed . He was shaking all over . He picked up the phone . The desk clerk , sleepy , answered . " Oui , monsieur ? " " Please send up a bottle of scotch and some Perrier . Black Label , if it exists . " " Le bar est ferme , monsieur . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mais le bar est . . . " " ... est ferme . Oui , je sais , and now send up the fucking scotch . " He slammed down the phone . He looked down at the hand again . Hitting a man like that , full force , with the leverage of his great height and reach , nearly two hundred pounds behind it , it was a wonder he did n't break the bastard 's neck . Suddenly he sat up . Suppose the Arab had been a panhandler ? Suppose he 'd simply wanted a handout ? No , that hand diving swiftly into the folds of his robe . A knife , a gun , a blackjack . But suppose it was just a deck of dirty pictures he wanted to pitch ? Winslow shook his head . That way lay madness . The desk clerk , understandably surly , brought the scotch . Winslow poured a stiff one . When had he last fought , hit anyone ? He remembered the instructor at Quantico telling him that a man his ! III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare hands into lethal instruments . He 'd shrugged and told the instructor he was having enough trouble just learning how to throw a knee to the groin without rupturing himself . His last real fight ? At Ithaca , it must have been , the year Bradley was still playing freshman ball and Winslow was starting at forward . That big black kid from Cornell  | ? he must have been six seven  --  practically broke his ribs with an elbow , and Winslow , blind with fury because Princeton was losing and this kid was manhandling him , had swung . He could still remember the sound of his fist hitting the big black sweating face , the sound of it and the feel , from his knuckles through his wrist and right up his arm to the shoulder . And that son of a bitch just stood there and grinned , and then had hit Winslow back . And knocked him down . The only thing about the fight worth remembering , the only part that was n't shameful , was that he got up , and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the game , he had dressed in a hurry and had gone outside to wait for the big black . Winslow had held out his hand and the black had taken it and they 'd talked for a while , awkwardly , but no longer angry ; and then the team bus was ready and he 'd left . Funny , he should remember the guy 's name . But he could n't . Remembering that way , now he remembered something else . The footsteps . There 'd been someone behind him , not the Arab he hit , but behind him . He 'd heard steps before the Arab stepped out of the doorway , he 'd heard them afterward . Alarmed , he thought of the others . Of Savio , of Joe the Wolf . He got the desk clerk to ring the Cafe de Paris . After a dozen rings someone answered . " Le Cafe est ferme . " " Listen , a friend of mine was there . With a boy . They ... " " You want a boy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't got boys here . You want , I look up the number for boys . " " Abdul Wa'Hoosh , not the fucking boy . Is he there ? Did he leave ? " " Yes , he left . Long time ago . " " Alone ? Do you know where he went ? " The man at the cafe assumed an injured air . " Monsieur , we do not report on the goings and comings of our faithful clientele . This is a respectable house . Most respectable . "  | He rang Savio . The diplomat answered , grunting his way out of sleep . " Jesus , I 'm glad I got you . Is everything okay ? " " Who the hell is this ? Winslow ? " " Yeah . Listen , do n't go out tonight . Just take it easy , huh ? " " Tony , it 's four thirty . I 'm asleep . I 'm not going anywhere . You drunk ? " " No . Just , I was worried about you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you about the show ? About the curtain calls ? " Winslow went to sleep after another drink . He was still wondering about the footsteps . In the morning he woke with a hand that hurt like hell , a vague sense of unease about the night before , and a headache . Then , without even trying , he remembered what it was Anouk Fayol had said that made no sense at all . The letter from old Grumbach . The last message from her father : " Some shit about seeking spiritual guidance . " He slid off the bed and looked at his watch . He might be able to make the morning plane .  | At a fashion show you look at the people first . Then at the clothes . Marianna Troy knew this . Intuitively . Her editor had gone back to New York and Vogue 's complement of front row seats was unfilled and Marianna had claimed one . Junior editors traditionally sit in the second row , taking notes , mentally swatching the fabrics , watching everything , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior people allotted a little gold chair in the very front row . It was the first press showing of Maggy Moal 's fall ready-towear line . The German buyers and the Japanese press and the Seventh Avenue copyists and whoever was a current enemy would be sent a ticket for the second day . The first day belonged to Maggy and the important press and a scatter of pals and private clients and the usual names from the cinema . Marianna had a seat directly across from Maggy 's pearl-gray couch . The old lady smiled when she saw her . Marianna wondered if Maggy remembered her from dinner or simply because she was a pretty girl with good legs and Maggy was in an acquisitive mood . On one side of Maggy was the editor of Elie magazine , a dried-out woman in boots and Chanel chains . On the other , a beautiful child who had just starred in her first film and who was , it was said , Maggy 's latest protegee . Most fashion designers remain offstage during the showings of  | their collections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannequins ' cabine . Marc Bohan of Dior helps dress the girls while his assistant sneaks looks through the drapes . Saint Laurent never looks , he 's too shy . Chanel used to sit at the top of the winding stairs watching through the multiple mirrored images . Captain Molyneux sat smiling in the audience , but then he did n't actually design anything ; his " nephew " did . Cardin opens with an endless speech no one can hear and then hides away . Courreges prances onstage with the models . And Ungaro remains invisible , watching through closed-circuit television . But Maggy Moal ? Maggy took the best seat in the house and enjoyed the show . Even before the first model came out into the pearl-gray room , Maggy was in action : talking , chain-smoking , dropping her cane and retrieving it , brushing ash from her lap , and adjusting her teeth whenever the upper plate slipped . " It 's all a betise , tu sais , " Maggy rasped , her eyes darting this way and that . " What the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unions . I found one of my premieres mains ' proselytizing for the union during working hours last week . I gave her the door . Twenty years with me and then , a dagger in the back . Hand me that ashtray . I wo n't tolerate treason . They want to sleep around , get a dose , that 's their affair . But I wo n't have them coming to work unwashed or carrying picket signs . ( Her cigarette went out . ) Who has a light ? And the mannequins ! Cows , most of them . They all want to be Madame what's-hername , it starts with a B ' I think , Bardot , that one , a very pretty little bottom and nice legs , but up here ( the chest ) it becomes gross . Gross ! Ah , here comes the first dress . I do n't like it , but tell me what you think . " Maggy dropped her cane again and swore softly . The little actress , who seemed to Marianna beautiful but quite stupid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sobbed with joy . " Madame , " she hissed , " it is too lovely to be real . " Maggy cackled . " Ah , " she said , loud enough to be heard  | throughout the room , " when one has an ass like yours you can wear hopsacking . " Marianna took notes . Not on Maggy 's comments , which would have been amusing but valueless , but on the clothes , which were predictable , dull , and of vital interest to Vogue . Mick Jagger 's wife slipped in late and took a seat saved for her by a vendeuse . She was wearing a bowler . Maggy lit one cigarette from another and spilled the ashtray 's contents with a trembling hand . " Ah , regardes ca . What an offense to nature for a woman to support a hat like that . On a man , well , that 's another matter entirely . I remember when I lived in London ... " Marianna took notes on the first half dozen numbers that came onto the runway and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moal was simply ringing a few changes on the bell , that the clothes were what they had been six months earlier and what they would be six months from now . Like Balenciaga and Chanel and Madame Gres , Maggy had become a classic . The younger , less established designers had to do it over again every spring and every fall . A Maggy Moal could cheat a little . Again , the harsh , rasping voice . Maggy was in a state , punching with one arthritic hand at her brown wig , which had somehow come unanchored , and which she kept trying to push back up into her straw hat . The cane was discarded now , lying on the carpet for a careless mannequin to trip over and earn a sound cursing . One cigarette burned in the ashtray , another in the crimson corner of her mouth . " Now this , " Maggy told the editor of Elle , " jetez un coup d'oeil at this one . Not bad , though I say it who should n't . " The fashion editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The girl is horrible , " Maggy announced . " Pregnant surely by that blackamoor she sleeps with . Ca n't wear clothes . Not in that state . Not at all . " She flicked the ash from her cigarette onto the lap of the young actress . The fashion editor nodded again . The actress smiled , and when Maggy was n't looking , brushed off her ripe lap . Marianna looked around the room . Parkinson , the British photographer , towered in one corner . The Puerto Rican fag in  | another . The English press ladies huddled together , all bad legs and veiny noses . A Mitteleuropean who called himself " Baron " and who supplied pirated fabric swatches to the reused woolen mills of Prato , took assiduous notes . Two French dancers , male , pressed their knees together . Picasso 's natural daughter smiled at the photographers . A pretty blonde from Glamour shredded her program and the Women 's Wear Daily editor nursed a hangover . " I ca n't abide this dress , " Maggy Moal barked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " It will sell , of course , taste being what it is . As for me , chiffon is nothing . Rien . The merest breeze blows it right up your crotch . " She lighted another cigarette and inhaled deeply . Some of the smoke went down the wrong way . Maggy leapt to her feet , coughing and gagging . The cane was kicked further out onto the floor and the ashtray went flying . Her straw hat tilted crazily and she dove into her handbag for a huge silk bandanna . The next few moments were occupied by sneezes and blowings of the nose . " Numero quatre-vingt-huit , " the vendeuse announced . " Merde ! " said Maggy Moal . " They grind up turds in the tobacco these days . " Tony Winslow was waiting for Marianna on the steps of the house . " Hello , " he said . " Well , hi . " " Drink ? Or do you have to go back to the office ? " She shook her head . " No , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zinc bar on the corner . Marianna ordered a citron presse and Winslow had a beer . They stood at the bar . It was only four thirty , too early for the workmen to come in , too late for the lunchtime drinkers . A rummy played the pinball . " Well ? " Winslow said , sensing her reserve . Marianna looked at him . " Hey , listen , I know all about liberation and stuff . Really I do . And being with you those times was great . And no regrets . But , hey , you do n't think you can just come and go this way and never ... "  | " I was in Africa , " he said , feeling slightly self-conscious about the sound of how it came out . " On business . " " Africa ? " " Yeah , Marrakesh . " " Oh , hell , " she said . " That 's just Morocco . I thought you meant Africa . " " Listen , " he said . " I need some help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fayol 's daughter . I 've got to find her . " Marianna lifted her hands . " Oh , boy , " she said , half to herself . " She 's one of Madame Claude 's girls , but when I put in a call from the airport , Claude played dumb . Where does she live ? Does anyone have a phone number ? " Marianna looked at him . " ' Winslow , " she said , " I 've got to hand it to you . We go to bed once . You fly off to Grasse . We go to bed again . You fly to Africa . You come back telling me you 've got to find some hundred-dollar-a-night hooker and complaining the madame does n't know and can I help ? I mean , Jesus ! " He nodded . " I know it sounds crazy . But it is n't . It 's damned important . " Marianna pulled out a cigarette . " Important ? " she asked . " Yes . " She exhaled deeply . " Okay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen ... " " Yes ? " " Do n't you think you can trust me enough to tell me something ? I mean , you 're running all over Paris , in and out of the country , desperate straits , kill the lead dog , ride the horses into the ground , but keep the flag flying . . . and I do n't know what the hell you 're doing or looking for or chasing . Do n't you think I ought to know ? Something ? " " Okay , " he said . " Do you have to go back to Vogue or can we sit and talk ? " She looked into his face . " We can talk , " she said . He reached out to light her cigarette and she saw his hand then , bruised and  | purpled . " Hey ? " she said , instinctively reaching out to touch it . Gently . " Okay , " Winslow said . " Here 's what happened . " He did not tell her the whole story . In fairness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts that were not essential . But he gave her most of it and did not hold back on what seemed vital . She listened , occasionally asking an intelligent question , and always watching his face as he talked and never wisecracking or saying a silly thing . Toward the end he said : " That note from Grumbach , the old huissier . The posthumous advice from her father , that 's the part does n't make sense . That 's the part I know is important but I need Anouk to tell me for certain . " ... seeking spiritual guidance ... that part ? " " Yeah . " " I do n't understand . A dying man , his only child , it 's not an unnatural thing to say . " " For Fayol it was . Remember what I told you about his wife . How she hated him for playing around , but just as much for rejecting religion , the church , God ? " " A deathbed confession . It happens . " Winslow shook his head . " Fayol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a message he 'd left with Grumbach some time before . Something that was to be transmitted to Anouk if and when he died . A message conceived by a man who had no intention of dying . No , it 's got to mean something more than it says . There has to be more to it than that . " That seemed to make sense , she said . All right , then , where did they start looking ? Castel 's ? New Jimmys ? Winslow said that was the damnable part of it . Anouk might just have gone off with someone for a day , for a week . She might be at St : Trop , in Italy , spring skiing at Val d'Isere . Who the hell knew ? Did Marianna have any ideas ? Any hunches ? Where would a beautiful young whore spend the last day of April ? " I think I know whom to ask , " Marianna said . " Who ? "  | " Zader Nafredi , " she said . There was an argument . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still daylight but getting darker , clouds on the wind off the Channel . A spatter of rain . " The government hopes it rains like hell , " he said . " Why ? Oh , for May Day . " " Sure , " he said . " Just like New York . During the hot summer . The cops always hope for rain on the weekends . " " Do you think there 'll be trouble ? " He shrugged . Then he stopped and took her arm . " Look , I do n't want you fucking around with Nafredi . We 'll find Anouk . We 'll drop by all the usual places tonight and . . . " " Oh , come on , Tony . He 's easy . He 's always been after me . I can call him , make a little date . Just drinks . I can ... " " You do n't know whether he 's dangerous . I do n't either . But I told you about those guys tracking me . Nafredi 's men , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a fop . A sleek ponce . Thinks every girl in Paris is mad for him . I can . . . " " He 's an Arab and I do n't want you to ... " Marianna shook her head . " Persians are not Arabs . They 're Moslems but they 're not Arabs . They ... " " Oh , shit . " They were walking again now , not so much because they wanted to , not because they were going anywhere in particular , but simply to walk . To argue and to walk . Because now it was raining hard and they had no coats . And they did n't really care . Henry Rousselot had lunched at the Bankers ' Club . Not La Grenouille or even the Twenty One Club , not by any stretch , but passable food and good service and a place where the pulse of the Street was never far beneath the surface of the steam tables . Now , shorn of his guest , he sat over a second coffee , toyed with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew these Delaware Corp . people . When they sent " A " to see him , it meant information . When they sent " B " it meant  | litigation . When they sent " C " it meant the bond market . And when they sent " D " it was trouble . Henry Rousselot wondered if he should call Winslow home . It was , after all , a banking matter . Not a war . He puffed at the cigar and worried . He had just bought lunch for " D. " Zader Nafredi hated the Pakistanis . Oh , he knew they were all part of the same Moslem League , that he should be indulging in fraternal bonhommie . But really , what shits they were . What total shits ! To play two hours of deadly serious squash , without a single , " tres bien joue , " without a smile , and . . . uncouth peasants .. never to concede a single easy point , well , you could keep your Pakistanis . And welcome to them . He emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dressing room . The Pakis had gone . Probably , he thought , they do n't even shower after a match . Quelle salete ! He toweled down and drank off two glasses of the iced water the boy had fetched . There was a full-length mirror on the wall opposite . Nafredi looked at himself . His anger began to slip away . He half turned . Not a pound of fat . Not an ounce . Anywhere . He smoothed back his damp hair and picked up the can of deodorant aerosol . The evening stretched pleasantly ahead . A new girl , that was what he needed . A different face , not just another girl from Claude . A foreigner , perhaps . An English girl . Or an American . He looked at himself again . Yes , he thought . He had begun to stiffen .  | Marianna Troy giggled . It was not like her to giggle . Not standard operating procedure at all for Yale graduates from Connecticut with decent grades and junior editorships at Vogue to giggle . Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of herself and of her relationship to the world around her . And to men . Marianna liked men , she enjoyed sex , and without indulging in adolescent ego-tripping she understood quite clearly that to most men she represented a readily negotiable piece of tail . But Marianna was giggling now . It was just before midnight and she was alone with Zader Nafredi in his apartment and she was nervy as hell . Nervy and also stoned . Tony Winslow had dropped her at her place at six . They were still arguing . She was still being protective about his hand . " It 's okay . Just looks awful . " She stroked it , the part that had gone purple . She said nothing , but shook her head . " Now do n't , dammit , start crying on me , " he said . " Who 's crying ? I 'm not crying . I 'm mad . " Tears ran down her cheeks . " Angry , " he said . " Okay , angry . Sore as hell . Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and people are beating you up and trying to kill you and I thought this country was at peace . "  | " Just to keep the record straight , " Winslow said sensibly , " I half killed that poor son of a bitch getting this . " He looked at his hand . Then : " What country 's at peace ? " " The U.S. of fucking A. , " she said . She was still crying but she was smiling , too . " All right , let 's just keep our goddamn countries straight . Let 's not go getting our countries mixed up . " " I never mix up countries . I got straight A 's in social studies in boarding school . " " Which used to be called geography . " She reached up and kissed him on the mouth . " Now get the hell out of here and let me go inside and get dressed up sexy and go and seduce Mr. Nafredi and find Anouk Fayol for you . " " I do n't like it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound like a little boy . And he 's not an Arab . He 's . . . " " I know , " Winslow said . He looked unhappy . Now it was nearly six hours later . Marianna had phoned Nafredi . " Ah , quel coincidence merveilleux , " he enthused . " I said to myself not two hours ago that it was time for me to be seeing some new faces . That Paris was going stale . And now .. . voila , you call . " They met at Laperouse . Nafredi , lean , dark , the hair going gray just ever so , the English-cut clothes , the long , tapering fingers . Marianna wore a silk shirt , a suede skirt , and boots . " You should have let me send the car . " " No , " she said . " I like the rain . " He had arranged one of the small , private dining rooms . She smiled over that . How corny could you get ? Well , all the better to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to herself . Nafredi snapped his fingers and the sommelier brought the first wine . Only the first . For a Moslem Nafredi had an enormous capacity . Marianna did not . When the souffle de chocolat arrived she was drunk . Nerves , nerves , and the wine and the necessity to play a role had done it . That and the Percodan Nafredi had dumped into her glass . " Hey , " she said . " What 's that for ? "  | Nafredi pointedly sprinkled a bit of powder into his own glass . They were at the Dom Perignon stage of the dinner by this . " To make you fly , my dear . And to permit me to fly a little bit as well . " He smiled . Oh , my God , she thought , if I really have to fuck this character I wo n't be able to live with myself . I laughed off better lines than his in junior high in Greenwich . Instead she smiled with what she hoped was half lechery , half mystery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on the door of the little room . " Entrez . " The waiter came in . He was a great diplomat . He was probably a second secretary at one of the lesser embassies when he was n't moonlighting at Laperouse . He did not look at Marianna . And with a straight face he suggested , " Monsieur , the Brie is very good . Runny , just as it must be . Also the Port Salut and naturally there is a decent chevre . " To his credit , Nafredi made an effort to consider the plateau of cheeses before settling on the chocolate souffle . It was at that point Marianna realized she was drunk . Thirty minutes later they left the restaurant . The chauffeured car sped them across town in the rain and Nafredi grappled with her in the back seat while she alternated between giggling and wondering how the hell she was going to get Anouk 's home phone number out of him and avoid being screwed at the same time . She was too drunk to notice the lines of buses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military policemen who were waving hooded flashlights to direct them to the appropriate assembly areas . Now she was in his bed . Or , rather , she was still lying atop the bed , fully clothed , the shirt open a bit , but the rest of her very comme it faut . Nafredi smirked . Marianna tried to suppress a giggle . There was something she wanted to ask him , some reason she was here . " My dear , " Nafredi said suavely , " you really must let me  | help you take off those wet boots . " He brightened . " Or do you prefer wearing them in bed ? " She giggled . How banal could he get ? Nafredi smiled , thinking her laughter complaisance . She remembered . " Zader , that girl you were seeing . Anouk . I liked her . She was sweet . " " Oh , yes , a splendid girl . A bit sullen at times . Not like you , all sunshine and laughter . You Americans , such an optimistic peopie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's call her . Let 's see if she 's home . " The Iranian 's eyes went wide . Mmmm , he thought , what a marvelous idea . Two girls . Both of them tall , dark , beautiful . One French , the other American . Who would have thought this college girl ( as he thought of her ) could stumble on such a diverting scheme . " Marianna , you 're delicious . I 'll phone her . " He went to a tall dresser and took a small leather book out of the top drawer . Ah , here it was . Her number . He was sure Anouk would enjoy it . The American , well , he was not so sure . It was the drink talking , that and the Percodan . But once they had begun , what could the American do ? Lie back and enjoy it , he smiled to himself . What a vulgar way they had with words . Yet how descriptive . He moved to the phone . Marianna sat up . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waist . Nafredi 's eyes were on her . " No , " she said , " lemme call . I want to talk to Anouk . " " Whatever you wish , darling . " Marianna took the phone from him . " ETOILE 67-82 , " he said . " Etoile what ? " " ETOILE **26;938;TOOLONG deux . " " Okay , " Marianna said . She dialed half the number and then dropped the phone , sat back against the headboard , smiled weakly at Nafredi , and said , " You do it . " He picked up the phone and untangled the cord . Perhaps he  | would watch , just watch , the first time . Watch these two beautiful young women make love . Then , when he was fully aroused , first one and then the other . Perhaps later , some photographs . He wondered if there was film in the camera . What a pleasant sight it would be . He began to dial . " Zader ? " Marianna said dreamily . " Yes , my pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marianna Troy leaned over the side of the bed and vomited . " ETOILE 67-82 , " Marianna said . " Least , I think so . I 'm still kinda stoned . " Winslow wrote down the number . " You 're sure you 're okay ? " " I 'm home , I 'm almost in bed , and I 'm alone . " She made a face . " And my mouth tastes like sneakers at the end of the season . Look , Tony , lemme go . I 'm going to get sick again . " He laughed into the phone . He thought she was being funny . " What did Nafredi say when you bailed out ? " " He called his man to clean up the mess , sent for the chauffeur to get rid of me , and mumbled something impolite about American women . " " The bastard . " " You would have said something impolite too if I upchucked on your best Persian carpet . " Winslow called the ETOile number . He called it over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought . Marianna had done her job , tricked Nafredi , spent a miserable evening , and now Anouk was away or coked up or just too damn lazy to answer . He called the phone company . No , there was no way they could give him the address . Finally , at four in the morning , he woke Paul Delane . " Have n't you got some friends in the police department or at the telephone company ? " " Who is this ? "  | " Winslow . Wake up . " " Winslow , you 're fucking crazy . Do you know what time it is ? What time is it ? " " I have this phone number . Anouk Fayol . But she does n't answer . " " Damn smart she is , I 'd say . " " If I give you the phone number , will you . . . ? " " I should n't have answered . " " Paul ... ! " " Okay , okay , give me the number . But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad enough as it is . " Winslow gave him the number . He thanked Delane and then he called the number a few more times and finally , still dressed , he fell asleep . He woke just before eight to the sound of drums . Confused , he looked at his watch . Then he threw back the curtains . The rain had stopped . It was a lovely morning . It was May Day .  | The rain had stopped . The streets were washed clean , the trees and the grass were a startling green , and despite the best efforts of the government 's meteorologists , the sun rose , shone brightly , and the first of May , celebrated throughout Europe and in most other civilized places as Labor Day , had begun . Winslow put on a robe and went out onto the balcony . He could see only a bit of the street . Men and women , some of them wearing sashes and uniforms , some carrying furled flags , milled about . From the top floor they seemed a jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , and rang for coffee and brioche . The eight o'clock news told him about the parade . They estimated 200,000 people would demonstrate in favor of the government , and being a nice , manageable government-regulated radio station , mentioned only in passing that a workers ' parade was also scheduled for that morning . They neglected entirely to say nearly half a million people were expected to march in opposition to the government . Winslow phoned Delane . The Frenchman told him grumpily , " I 'm calling , I 'm calling , " and hung up . He tried Anouk 's number . No answer . He thought of calling Marianna and decided against it . She needed the sleep and it was a holiday . Across the street he was pleased to see that his neighbor had come out on her balcony to see what all the noise was about and that she wore  | a very pretty short pink robe that looked fine above her tanned legs . By nine thirty Winslow was shaved , showered and dressed , and he decided to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Winslow remembered there had been no papers at the door . " C'est la grove , " the concierge said cheerfully . There was a strike . Nothing serious . But certain services might endure a disruption for the day . " Vous savez , monsieur , c'est les syndicats . " The unions . It was the unions . Winslow and the concierge exchanged shrugs , as experienced men do , and he stepped out into the morning sunlight where the page bowed and where one of the porters was sweeping . It was a lovely day for a parade , Winslow thought . The sun was warm , nothing like the Marrakesh sun , but pleasant . He walked left and went up to the avenue Franklin Roosevelt . Here the street was already closed off by the cops and a band and several hundred men with arm bands smoked cigarettes and waited impatiently for something to happen . He turned left again and walked up to the Rond Point . There was still vehicular traffic on the Champs but there were a half dozen motorcycle cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent they would soon shut down the Champs as well . If you want to get anywhere today , Winslow told himself , you 'd better plan on walking . That or the Metro . He wondered if the subway was running . He crossed the Rond Point and ducked into one of the cafes on the other side . He tried Anouk again and then called Delane and told him he 'd check in every hour or so . The Frenchman said he was working on it . He sounded less annoyed now . Winslow assumed he had had some coffee . Winslow sat at one of the tables on the sidewalk and ordered a citron presso . It was getting warm . The waiters were already hustling with most of the tables taken by tourists and a few curious Frenchmen . Away off in the distance he thought he could hear other bands , other loudspeaker trucks . He wondered if it was all part of the government parade or if this was the workers . He hoped to hell the lines of march of the two parades did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Winslow tried Anouk 's number again . Goddammit , where was the woman ? He knew exactly what he would ask her , it would take only a few minutes , and then he could go on and .. . suddenly , he stopped . Grumbach ! The huissier ! Why had n't he thought of that ? Grumbach could tell him just what was in Fayol 's last note . Jesus , why had n't he thought of that ? He hurried away from the cafe and his long legs carried him toward the Faubourg St.-Honore . Grumbach might have taken the day off , he might not talk . But if he was on holiday , surely he could bribe his home address out of the concierge . And he was confident he could charm , or bully , the old notary into giving him something . Anything was better than waiting for Anouk . He took off his suit jacket and slung it over his shoulder and strode along . All Paris seemed to be on the march and he had to push his way past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petits Champs was too narrow to be a marshalling area . The street was quiet , shuttered , and except for one or two children playing and a concierge washing down the steps , it was deserted . He rang for the concierge of Grumbach 's building . An old woman peeked through the lace curtain and then , recognizing him to be neither an obvious rapist nor a bill collector , she opened her door . " Ferme , " she said . Closed for the day . " Oui , je sais . Mais Monsieur Grumbach ? I1 n'est pas la ? " She looked confused . " Monsieur Grumbach ? " he repeated . The old lady stared at him . " Monsieur Grumbach ici ? Evidemment pas . " Did she perhaps have his home address ? It was a matter of some importance . He and Grumbach were close friends , practically brothers , and Monsieur Grumbach would be disconcerted indeed if his old friend who had come so far were not to spend a pleasant hour with him . " You are his friend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all the world , perhaps his closest , his dearest , his .. .  | " Then I am sorry to have to break the bad news , monsieur . " What bad news ? He was n't out of town ? En vacances ? No , the concierge said , " il est mort . " " Dead ? But he ca n't be ... " The old woman smiled . She was quite pleased to have such a divertissement on a dull morning . " C'est vrai . Il est mort depuis cinq jours . Six , peut-etre . " Dead five or six days ? My God , when had Winslow seen the old man ? He started to count back . The concierge was pointing . La , right there . Death was instantaneous . The truck , the way it they speed these days , it 's a wonder any Parisians are still alive and ... " " A truck killed him ? " " Ah , mais oui . The poor fellow . " " And he ... ? " " You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the concierge said , eyeing Winslow shrewdly . " So feeble , shaking , and the trouble with his eyes . All that close work . He stepped into the street , never looking this way or that , and voila ... " The detective at the local precinct regarded him bleakly . Grumbach had been the victim of an auto accident . The truck driver might face a technical charge of involuntary manslaughter , nothing beyond that . He had been released , of course . The old gentleman had been buried . Winslow tried to probe . The cop stood up . It was a holiday , a half million people were marching , a general strike had been declared with fortunately only so-so effectiveness , monsieur must understand the police had other things to do than to review a routine traffic accident that had occurred five days earlier . Winslow phoned Delane from the stationhouse . Delane rummaged through his issues of Le Figaro . " Yes , here it is . He was seventy-two . Most unfortunate accident . The Societe des Huissiers plan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found Anouk ? No , but he had the address . Did Winslow want to meet him  | there ? In an hour ? Make it an hour and a half . It was a bitch trying to get around town with parades and the strike . Winslow was angry as he walked back across Paris toward the Etoile , toward Anouk 's apartment . Old men got run over every day by careless truck drivers . Arab toughs held up tourists who 'd been drinking in dubious parts of Marrakesh at three in the morning . Fathers with high blood pressure sent last words regarding spiritual advice to wayward daughters . Rich , sleek men like Nafredi preyed on long-legged American girls with blue eyes and erect nipples . Fags sent anonymous threatening notes and promised bribes . And spoiled 19-year-old French girls took drugs and wore leather underwear and disappeared for days at a time . These things happened . There was nothing bizarre about any of them . Except when they all happened at once . And when they all happened because a merchant banker from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , dusty files about a modestly profitable fashion house that suddenly seemed to be worth a hundred million dollars . " I 'm damned if it 's all coincidence , " Winslow told himself . " Damned ! " Both parades were in full flower now . The workers , many of them carrying red flags , snaked through the streets heading east , toward the Place de la Bastille . It was a cheerful march . The Left sensed it was coming to power and it wanted to demonstrate its maturity , its cohesiveness , its capacity to rule the nation . This was n't a day for surly defiance , for the baiting of the police , for window smashing or the overturning of cars . The bands played . The " Marseillaise , " the " Internationale , " martial music , and popular tunes clashed and blended . Children romped alongside , and occasionally a drunk staggered into the line of march to be shoved gently back to the curbside . At the other end of Paris , along the Champs Elysees , there were fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had n't been a Popular Front government in France since the thirties , and these people did n't mean to have one now . Their  | march was somber , pugnacious , and slightly nervous . The progovernment forces were decidedly not looking forward to the tenth of May , to the elections , possibly to the end of an era of privilege and the start of a time of social revolution . Especially grim were the officers , the CRS riot police , and the veterans groups . Only among the detachments of " paras , " of marines , of air force troops , and among the sailors with their red pompons was there joy . To be in Paris , on a pleasant holiday in the spring , meant pretty girls , cold beer , and a few hours away from the drudgery of garrison tedium . Winslow was having even more trouble getting through the crowds this time . Anouk 's flat was in a good building on the Avenue Marceau , a few steps from the back door of Le Drugstore . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy . Holidays bored him . He hated parades and loathed politics . The general strike upset the routine of his life and he could not amuse himself by working , since there was no staff . Winslow 's summons , the mysterious death of the huissier , the search for a beautiful girl with dubious morals , this pleasantly conspiratorial mission , and the sense of being wanted , being needed even , erased the ennui of the day . Paul Delane was at the top of his form . There was no answer at Anouk Fayol 's apartment . Delane was sent to fetch the concierge . The old gentleman performed as advertised : with petulance , fatigue , and irritation  --  outraged at this proposed invasion of his tenant 's privacy . " You expect me to open the door of an apartment of one of my finest young clients ? " he demanded . " It 's important , " Winslow said lamely . The concierge shook his head . He stamped his foot , but he was wearing soft carpet slippers and the gesture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never heard of such an impudent suggestion ! Mademoiselle Fayol pays her rent on time , she is most generous to my staff ( the concierge and his wife ) , she is a young woman alone whose safety and privacy I am sworn to uphold . "  | " He wants fifty francs , " Delane whispered . Winslow handed over the money . " But of course , " the concierge declared as he inserted his passkey , " if it is a matter of importance , then surely I would be less than faithful to Mademoiselle Fayol to prevent her friends from entering . " He opened the door , gave a half-bow , and shuffled off . Except that it was more luxurious , better appointed , the living room was about what would be expected of a nineteen-year-old Paris career girl . There was a good stereo , a well-stocked bar , several rather nice pictures , the usual magazines , a stack of newspapers ranging from L'Humanite to The Sunday Times of London . It was in the bedroom that the scene changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frederick 's of Hollywood . " " Comment ? " Delane asked . " Never mind , " Winslow said . The room was constructed around the circular waterbed . There was an electric cord . Delane held it up . " Complete with thermostat . " There were mirrors everywhere , including , of course , the ceiling . An intricate strobe light setup included several different-colored jellies . A flip of the switch sent them revolving and the room was turned into a nightmare of rapidly moving , constantly changing colored lights . " I wonder if she has video tape . " Delane shook his head . " When I was her age I was happy to make love in the stairwell . Considered myself damned lucky to get it anywhere . " Winslow nodded . " But you 're a romantic , Delane . " He opened a closet . There were the usual street clothes and then there were ... well , costumes . Winslow held one up . It was sheer , black , and apparently composed mostly of open spaces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I need ideas for my next collection . " Winslow 's natural distaste for prying capitulated to curiosity . He opened a dresser drawer . Sweaters . Another . Stockings and  | pantyhose . A third . A collection of dildos . He held one up . " Ah , " Delane said , " how can mere man compete with the genius of the rubber specialty trade ? " He took the device . " I did n't know they came so large . " On the back of the bathroom door , on a hook under a terry robe , they found the dog whip . " Well , " Winslow said , " she was n't kidding , I guess . " By the phone on the night table was a small revolving file . Phone numbers . Boy , he thought , what the tabloids would n't give for this . Curious , he spun to the " W 's . " His name had n't yet been entered . He did n't know whether to be sore or relieved . Under the " N 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delane , " do n't you think it 's about time you gave me some rational reason why you 've taken up breaking and entering ? ' Why this morbid interest in Anouk Fayol ? " Winslow thought for a moment . " Yeah , " he said , " yeah , I guess it is time . " They closed the apartment and Winslow gave his phone number and another fifty francs to the concierge . " When Mademoiselle Fayol returns , please call me at the Hotel . At any hour . It is most important . " The concierge would not fail to do so . For gentlemen such as these there was very little he would fail to do . Tony and Paul worked their way through the May Day crowds and went into an American bar on the rue de Berri down the street from the Herald-Tribune building . They ordered drinks . " Well ? " Delane asked . Winslow lighted a cigar . " Okay , I 'll give you everything I can . I 'm getting a bit pissed off trying to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told most of this to Marianna . Now to you . But you 've got to keep it quiet . " Delane nodded . " She went to Yale , did she not ? The lovely Mademoiselle Troy ? " Winslow said yes . " And you to Princeton , and I am a Harvard man . Ah , " said Delane , " an Ivy League entente cordiale . " He was pleased by the line . Withholding only the name of Rousselot 's client , Dela-  | ware Corp. , Winslow told him the story . They had finished their second scotch by the time he finished . " You think the huissier was murdered ? " Delane asked , uncharacteristically somber . Winslow looked at his friend . " What else is there to think ? " As May Day was celebrated with marches and music on the Right Bank , with student riots and bloody retaliation on the Left , as Anthony Winslow and Paul Delane picked their way through Anouk Fayol 's underwear , there were other happenings , more or less significant . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time , packed her several passports , a great deal of money , and several open tickets to Zurich , to Nice , and to London , and prepared herself for flight . In suburban Montfort L'Amoury , where there were no riots or marches but only some very decent polo , the Shah 's man , Zader Nafredi , congratulated himself on having successfully bribed the one person who might deliver into his hands the great fashion house of Fayol . In New York , where it was not a holiday , Henry Rousselot puffed at his pipe , fretted about the rain that threatened to wash out his golf the next day , and wondered whether he should acquaint young Winslow with his suspicions about the Delaware Corp . and the real reason they were willing to pay $85 million ( or more ) for a Paris fashion house and the " real property " the house presumably owned . And in her flat on the rue de Boulainvilliers , Marianna Troy once more threw up and , once more , vowed never again to mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Persians later than Cyrus the Great . As for Anouk Fayol , it would be Sunday night before Winslow would have news of her .  | Winslow phoned Marianna late Friday night . He gave her a reprise of events , excepting the death of the huissier . He saw no point in upsetting her . He would tell her later . Marianna promised to stay home that night , in case of trouble following the parades . " Anyway , I still feel lousy , " she said . Delane took Winslow to a bistrot near the Porte des Ternes . Marchers , some of them wearing armbands or carrying furled flags , came in and settled down to the serious business of a French dinner . There were rumors of fighting on the Left Bank , but here , at the western gate of the city , it was quiet , the marchers being more interested in the menu than in politics . By midnight , when they started home , the streets had been cleared and there were plenty of cabs . Delane continued to insist they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to isolate the trackers as he had done at Colombes . Back in his hotel room Winslow wearily stripped and got into bed . He made one more call to Anouk 's apartment . The phone rang and rang . There was no reply . " I 've got an absolutely brilliant idea , " Marianna said . It was ten o'clock Saturday morning . Wakened by her call , Winslow sat up in bed and reached out a long arm to pull back the drapes . Dazzling sun burst into the room . He flipped a ciga-  | rillo out of the pack and lighted it , cradling the phone between ear and shoulder . " You are a constant source of brilliant ideas . Give . " " Madame Fayol . We 'll go see her . " Winslow drew in the smoke . " Yeah ? " " Sure . She 's a religious fanatic . We 'll tell her about her husband 's last message to Anouk . About spiritual guidance . ' She 'll know what it means . " " And she 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product of the best schools ? " They met at Brasserie Lipp for lunch , took turns calling Anouk , got no answer , and then took a cab to the Avenue Foch . A woman in gray admitted them . From somewhere deep in the house came the same chanting he had heard before . Marianna stood close to him . " Monsieur Winslow et Mademoiselle Troy pour Madame Fayol , s'il vous plait . " " Veuillez attendre . " The woman disappeared into the depths of the house . Winslow took Marianna 's arm . He could feel her trembling , just slightly . " If she asks , " he said , " try to be enthusiastic about Gregorian chant . " She smiled , cool now , the trembling over . Helene Serrat Fayol came into the anteroom . " Yes ? " Winslow told her it was vital they contact Anouk . " You mean Anne , " the woman said . " Yes . " Mme. Fayol led them into a rather formal sitting room off to the right . She beckoned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you were first here , Monsieur Winslow , I told you I had very little knowledge of my late husband 's business affairs and I think I also informed you that my daughter and I have had very little contact for some time . Nothing has altered that situation since last we met. "  | You 're a cold one , Winslow thought . " I think something has altered it , " he said . " Yes ? " " Monsieur Grumbach , the huissier to whom you kindly sent me , is ... " " He is dead . Yes , I know . An unfortunate accident . " Winslow let that one slip by . " Of course , " he said smoothly . " But before his death Grumbach had sent a last message from your husband to Anouk . . . Anne . " " Oh ? And how do you know this ? " Winslow dove in . " Anne told me . " Helene Fayol looked pointedly at Marianna . " Your stay in Paris seems to have been full of event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what light I can . . . " " Anne mentioned the message , told me roughly what it said , but not the details . I need those details . And Anne seems to be ... out of town . " " I can not help you . " " Madame Fayol , " Winslow said , speaking quietly , intensely , with what he hoped was at least a facsimile of religious fervor , " that last message dealt with Anne 's spiritual life . It urged her to seek spiritual guidance , ' to . . . " Helene Fayol laughed . It was a bitter sound . " Forgive me , Monsieur Winslow , mademoiselle , but it is a bad joke to associate my late husband 's name with references to higher realms . His very being was so rooted in this earth , in materialism , in pleasure , that it is simply inconceivable that he would have anything to say on the subject of spirituality . The message is clearly fraudulent . " She stood up . Winslow knew it was hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a lovely sound that is , Madame . Might we possibly listen for a moment ? " Helene Fayol smiled . For the first time her face took on life . " Of course , " she said . " Come . " Like most private homes , " hotels particuliers , " along the Avenue Foch , the house seemed to have more depth than width .  | Helene Fayol led the way through several other large rooms and down a hallway into the back of the house , into what had apparently once been a solarium with high vaulted ceilings and walls of glass . But instead of a room flooded with the afternoon sun , everything was dim and dusty . Ivy crept everywhere on the outer surface of the glass , crawling upward over the windows , upward over the glassed ceiling , screening and obscuring the light , throwing the solarium into churchlike gloom , creating a stainedglass effect through clear panes . Madame Fayol halted , just inside the great high room , as if to adjust her vision to the artificial dusk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully done , but disturbing . Winslow could feel Marianna standing very close . There were perhaps a dozen people in the room . Five or six wore the same dull-gray stuff of Helene Fayol 's costume . There were several monks , cowled and kneeling at prie-dieux . The women formed a semicircle around a small organ at which was seated a slender young man with tonsured head and white flowing robes . Two younger women , girls really , in the same white robes , flanked the organist , holding tall lighted candles . The young man seemed to be leading the chant . He sang a line in a strong , pure tenor and the women and the monks responded , the young man accompanying them on the keyboard . Winslow wondered if he and Marianna were supposed to join in , to kneel , or simply to listen . Helene Fayol motioned them to stand with her . The chanting was solemn , lonely , beautifully done . Even Winslow , who had no ear at all , could tell that . He let his gaze wander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some religious pictures , a crucifix , what seemed to be an incense burner , some icons that might have been Russian , and a curiously primitive painting of the Virgin . Helene Fayol joined in the chanting . She had a high , sweet voice . " ............ " they chanted . Winslow 's eyes were watering . He blamed it on the incense . Marianna stood close to him . " ............ " they chanted .  | It was like nothing he had ever heard . It throbbed , it lifted him , carried him . His face felt damp and his eyes continued to run . Beside him Marianna followed the chant with her lips . He reached for her hand and squeezed it . Goddammit , Winslow swore at himself . He drove the nails of his free hand into the palm . He pulled Marianna closer to him and felt her smooth hip against his . He concentrated on breathing deeply , slowly . " they chanted . And then it was over . Helene Fayol led them back through the house . Winslow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own reactions . He had nearly fainted , something he could never remember having done . Ever . Marianna and Helene were chatting , pleasantly , as if they had just heard a pleasant bit of chamber music in someone 's music room . He could not seem to hear clearly what they were saying . He could smell the incense . Then Helene Fayol was extending her hand and he was taking it . She was smiling , a controlled smile , but a smile . And saying something . He mumbled something in French in return , " . . . je vous en prie , " some meaningless politesse . Marianna shook hands and then , instinctively , reached and kissed Helene Fayol , lightly , on each cheek . There were more vague words . Then , blessedly , they were in the open air , in front of this ordinary house on the Avenue Foch . Winslow was surprised to see it was still daylight . They went down the path and out through the gate to the footpath . Winslow sighed . " Another blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslow said . " You must n't have been listening , " she said . Winslow looked blank . " When we were leaving . When Madame Fayol took us to the door . You were n't listening . " " Listening ? I was just trying to stay on my feet . That damned incense . I . . . well , what was it I did n't listen to ? " " Nothing much , " Marianna said . " Just the name of the priest . " Winslow tensed . " What priest ? "  | " The one who 's going to provide Anouk Fayol with spiritual guidance . " Tony Winslow stayed with Marianna that night . Delane met them for dinner . Having survived May Day without an explosion , Paris was in a Saturday night mood . Delane drove them to the Grand Comptoir and they had steaks and pommes frites and bottles of young Brouilly chilled . Winslow was still shaken by his experience at Helene Fayol 's . Delane told him that was all nonsense , that people reacted in different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church for years , all that chanting and nuns and monks and incense had been too much for him . " My God , man , " Delane said in exasperation , " one minute you 're on the Avenue Foch watching the jeunes filles go by , the next you 're in the Sistine Chapel among the cherubs and the seraphim and the thrones and dominations . . . " " Paul , " Marianna asked , " how do you know so much about religion ? " " I am a man of parts , cherie . Most couturiers spend their lives basting and tucking and swatching and creating lovely nothings . I am a man pursued by two demons , the making of money and the amassing of knowledge . " He paused . " And , needless to say , there is money in religion . Right now , at this very moment , I am negotiating for a commission to redesign the Dominican habit . If all goes well  --  and with God 's blessing , why should n't it ? ? the Cistercians , Benedictines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No Franciscans ? " Winslow asked , pleased to know the name of an order . Delane shook his head . " A poor lot . Their vow of poverty .. . it impoverishes them so . " He brightened . " I also refuse the Jesuits . Their intellectualism , it leaves no room for a color sense . " At the next table were a family of four : the mother and father , tres bourgeois ; the son and daughter , radical , ye-ye , anti-establishment . Winslow found himself listening to their talk . The parents had attended the pro-government parade the day before ;  | their children had marched with the Left . They were discussing the issues now , very politely , very solemnly . It made a nice change from an election in the States , Winslow thought ; and then he remembered the dead huissier and the men shadowing him , and it did n't seem all that nice . " Do n't you want to know what Helene Fayol told me ? " Marianna asked , a bit deflated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delane leaned forward . " Well , " Marianna said , " there was a priest called Masson , during the war . Apparently he and Fayol had some dealings . The old priest was something formidable with the Resistance , blowing up bridges , baptizing children , ambushing Germans , reading his office , all at the same time . Fayol was , well , he was a bit fuzzy . Collaboration one day , flag-waving patriotism the next . Anyway , this priest , Masson , and Fayol became very close during the war and used to have these ferocious theological debates . Fayol clenching his fists and damning heaven , the old priest sprinkling holy water and telling his beads . " And ? " Winslow asked . " And , simply , that there was something of a bond between them . If Fayol had wanted Anouk to turn to anyone for guidance , it would have been to Masson . " " My God , " Winslow said , " what a break . Where is he ? " Marianna 's face sort of changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she thinks he 's dead . " Paris had a curious style that night as Delane drove them home . The Saturday night theatergoers , the well-fed emerging from the restaurants , the lovers on the Seine bridges , the buses and the taxis and the cars hurrying along  --  and on the silent street corners , just out of the lamplight , the CRS boys with their machine guns , the big blue buses parked in the shadows , the cruising police cars and motorcycle cops . When they entered the apartment Marianna turned out the hall light and led the way , her long legs striding , into the bedroom , where she put on a low light and some music on the radio  | and matter-of-factly stripped off her sweater and shirt and began to unzip her jeans before Winslow had even loosened his tie . When she was naked she turned down the bed clothes and then looked at him as if to say " Well ? " and then she got into bed and waited . Later , after they had made love and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one glass , Winslow thought how comfortable and domesticated he felt , and how , without having made a judgment , he very much liked the feeling . On Sunday they bought the English papers and some fresh croissants , and Marianna ground coffee and brewed it , and they spent the afternoon in bed . Delane called to say Maggy Moal was having the vapors over the political crisis , and could they dine with her ? " The old dame wants some young people around to tell her the world will not end next Sunday , " he said . " You 've got the wrong man , " Winslow told him . " I 'm convinced it will . " Marianna said she could n't face one of Maggy 's monologues , the weekend having been emotional enough , and would Delane mind terribly going along without them ? " Once more into the breach , dear friends , " he said , and hung up . Marianna creased her brow . " I wonder if he has any idea of the origin of that line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , the old lady 's convinced the country is for the shit pile . She rather hopes for a putsch . But only if the army gets some decent uniforms and brings back red stripes on the trousers . " " D' you discuss Madame Fayol with her ? " Winslow wanted to know . Paul threw up his hands . " But of course . I lied a bit , told her I 'd dropped by Avenue Foch to pay my respects  --  grieving widow , all that nonsense ? and asked her what she thought of the lady .  | " Mean , narrow-minded , puritanical , priest-ridden , a spiritualist , necromancer , and assuredly a witch . ' Maggy said Helene dabbles in the occult , has a string of paid lovers , all of whom are renegade seminarians , takes drugs , overpays her servants to ensure their discretion , serves bad wine , always was a lousy dancer , and probably had a lesbian affair with Madame Nhu . Beyond that , Maggy says she 's quite fond of her . " Delane drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , you know , " the Frenchman said . " Same ones ? " " Du n no . But they were lurking outside Marianna 's place when I came by tonight . Hope to hell they do n't start leaning on her . " Winslow glowered . " I should have had her come to the hotel , " he said . Delane told him not to worry , and Winslow said he 'd try not . In the morning , Monday , they would begin checking out priests . Winslow was in bed and nearly asleep when the concierge called . " Mademoiselle Fayol , " he said portentously , " has returned . "  | Anouk Fayol opened the door of her apartment . Winslow was there standing in the hall , annoyed , impatient , angry . " Where the hell have you been ? " he demanded . Anouk looked absolutely marvelous . She was wearing white duck pants and a striped jersey . She was very suntanned , her long hair tied up in a rag of crimson silk . The striped jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in the tight white pants . Just two hours earlier Winslow had left Marianna Troy , thinking her as exciting a woman as he had ever known . Now he stood facing Anouk Fayol . And had he thought on it , he would have realized he was not thinking about Marianna . Not at all . " Well ? " he asked . " Fuck you , " she said . Winslow had been waiting for her for so long , it seemed he should be the one aggrieved . Instead , here was this slim young woman standing in the doorway of her own home and he felt the interloper . " I 've been trying to get in touch , " he said weakly . " Ever since the other night . " " And ? " " Well , you were n't here . " She put her hands on her slim hips . " That 's rather obvious , is n't it ? " Winslow realized this was n't at all the way he intended it  | should be . " Look , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I had a question ... " " Oh , come on , " Anouk said , " the other night was a bit of a flop . I 'm sorry for that . If you want to buy me for another evening , tres bien , anything you want . But set it up properly . Through Claude . I 'm not in the mood right now for all that filthy bargaining . " Anthony Winslow , Princeton , Harvard , and Rousselot &; Partners , did not know quite what to say . Here was this nineteen-yearold girl toying with him , putting him down , leaving him on the doorstep like a teenage boy lusting for a good-night kiss . He had the manic notion he should tip his hat and go off alone into the night , his corduroy knickers whistling regret . Instead , he said : " Shut up . Get inside . I want to talk to you . " His belligerence was just irrational enough to be effective . Anouk stepped back and Winslow walked in . The girl stood there watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if she was to defend herself . " Anouk , " Winslow said , more gently , " do you know a priest called Masson ? " " Masson ? " " A friend of your father 's . From the war . " " My father 's friend . . . ? " She seemed dazed by the question . Winslow thought it the time for tact . " Look , Anouk , where the hell have you been ? I 've been calling and coming by here since last Friday . You ... " " How did you know where I lived ? " " A long story . I saw your mother . She told me about Masson . The man I went to see a week ago , Grumbach , your father 's huissier , he 's dead . " " Dead ? He ca n't be dead . " " Hit by a truck . An accident , the police say . " She was vague now , really vague . She sat down on the nearest chair . Suddenly she looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dead , " she said . " He sent me a letter . A message from Fayol . From my father , " she corrected herself .  | " I know , " Winslow said . " You told me . The other night . " Anouk began to laugh . " I go off for a pleasant weekend with friends and come home to find a strange American telling me my father 's notary has been run down by a truck and asking questions about a priest my father knew during the war . You do n't find all this a bit odd ? " Winslow sat down without being asked . The damn thing was odd : nearly keeling over during some silly prayer service , going to rugby matches just to hold a private conversation , bribing concierges , dawn flights to Marrakesh , priests and notaries , being tailed like some unfaithful husband . " I 'd like a drink , " he said . " All right , " she said , sounding very sensible . She brought ice and glasses and Winslow poured stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but under the tan she looked tired . There was something about the eyes . He wondered about her " pleasant weekend with friends . " Having an active imagination rather handicapped him in talking to her . He kept seeing mustachioed men whipping her in her leather underwear . " A Greek , " she said , apropos of nothing . " What ? " " It was a Greek this time . His name does n't matter . Not Niarchos , one of the others . His yacht . It was smashing . " She talked like an English girl from one of the home counties . The same adjectives . " Smashing . " It must have been the private schools . " The sex too ? " he asked . She shrugged . " Oh , well , you know , the sex is part of it . It 's expected . But the yacht was the terrific part . And several cinema stars . They 're gathering for Cannes , for the film festival . " " Oh , you were at Cannes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " actually . " He smiled over it . " Why are you laughing ? Is it at me ? " Suddenly she was stern , defensive . " I would never laugh at you , Anouk . " He was quite sincere . " I ca n't believe my mother would tell you about Canon Mas-  | son . About anything . She usually refuses to discuss my father . She really hates him . Hated him . " " I tricked her , I 'm afraid . But she did give me Masson 's name . Said she was sure he was dead . " " Ha ! " " Oh ? " " She knows he 's not dead . What a silly thing to do  --  give you his name and then , when it 's so easy to trace a Catholic priest in France , to lie about that . How foolish she is . A stupid woman . " " Canon Masson , " Winslow said , trying to be nonchalant , " where would I find him ? " " But do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grasse . He 's the pastor in Grasse . " He left her at three o'clock in the morning . They had made love . He pretended to himself that he did it because he needed her , that he was using her , that this was the most effective means of insinuating himself with her , getting Anouk on his side . It did n't wash . He 'd wanted her the first time he 'd ever seen her , and now , after all the twists and turns , he had her . They had talked , of course , over a second drink . Masson and her father had been together during the war . She did n't know the story , but apparently Masson was some sort of great hero in the Resistance and her father had been , well , equivocal about the Germans . But there was a bond between the two men , something that held the hero and the collaborationist together , something that . . . she broke off . " Look , I do n't know the story . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him , but my father used to tell me stories . He 's quite a numero , apparently  --  swills wine all day and preaches great sermons and raises the dead , that sort of thing . Might be good for your soul , as well . " " I 'm sure of that , " Winslow admitted . Then , half to himself : " But does he have Paris One ' ? " " What ? " " Nothing . Is there more scotch ? "  | Anouk got up and went into the kitchen for ice . Winslow knew now that he would go to Grasse to see Father Masson . And that the girl would go with him . Would have to go with him . She was the key to Masson . A priest , already practiced in the art of keeping his mouth shut , and a Resistance hero besides , would not likely be terribly chatty , with an American he did not know , about his old friend , lately dead , and the old friend 's only daughter . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And call on the parish priest . To discuss , well , Anouk 's " spiritual guidance . " She came back into the room . She had no ice . She was naked . Winslow got up and she moved into his arms , standing on tiptoes so that her mouth could reach his . She did not taste of scotch or cocaine or of Greeks with yachts . She tasted marvelous . In bed , after they had made love the first time and now lay together , her arm across his chest , their legs entwined , he asked her , Why ? She looked into his face and said quite simply , " Because I wanted to . " " Can we talk about the Maison Fayol ? " he asked . " About the people who sent me here to buy it ? About the money they ... " " Shut up , " she said . He moved to free his right arm , and with his hand he began to rotate her nipple . She shivered slightly and then , sliding down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move and he felt the first renewed stirring of erection . He watched the top of her head , the silky , shining hair , and for that moment at least , her answer seemed sufficient . The concierge woke Winslow . There were two men , from " the Ministry , " waiting in the lobby . They wished to see him . " What ministry ? " Regrettably , the concierge did not have this information . " Give me five minutes and send them up , " Winslow said . He swung his legs out of bed . What the hell was this all about ? He thought about showering and then decided just to pull on pants  | and a shirt . There was a knock . The two men came in and shook hands . One of them handed him a business card . It identified him as from the Ministry . Winslow asked what he could do for the ministry . The one who had handed him the card launched into a complicated review of Franco-American commercial relations dating back to the Treaty of Versailles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policemen , bad haircuts , heavy shoes , cheap raincoats , and those silly flat French fedoras affected by the civil service . " I think you 've got me confused with the commercial department of the American Embassy , " Winslow said . " But you are here to negotiate the purchase of a French corn- pang , are you not ? " That , Winslow said flatly , was a confidential matter . If and when any serious negotiations were undertaken , the ministry would of course be notified and the various clearances sought . The answer was not entirely satisfactory , the lead Frenchman regretted to say . The ministry was aware that negotiations with the Maison Fayol had already reached an advanced state . It was essential that .. . Winslow stood up , tired of fencing . " Look , " he said , " who is it , precisely , who wants this informa-tion ? " The men 's eyes bugged . But they thought he knew . How stupid of them to have rambled on this way . Could he possibly forgive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if only they could now inform him as to just who ... ? " Monsieur le ministre , " the junior partner said reverentially . They were the first words he had spoken . " And does the minister wish to speak with me ? " Winslow asked . Oh , if only that could be arranged , what a beneficence for all concerned , how quickly all these confusions would be cleared up , how their careers would flourish , how Franco-American relations would ripen and deepen .. .  | Winslow got the idea . " D'accord , " he said . " Now if you 'll retreat to the lobby and let me finish dressing , I 'll be with you in ten minutes and we 'll go see Monsieur le ministre . " The two flunkies bowed and backed out the door , taking their flat hats and their bad haircuts and the cheap smell of the national police with them . Winslow got dressed . There was a touch of Mussolini about the cabinet minister . His desk , an ornate Empire affair , rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms used by college professors to anchor , and elevate , their desks . The room was long and relatively narrow , and it took a long time to get to the desk . A single straight-backed chair was placed so that a visitor would be somewhat below the minister and would be looking directly into a large window that during certain of the daylight hours provided a sort of halo around the minister 's head . Winslow , who did n't like the setting , remained standing . " Now , " the minister said , " we seem to have a small problem , Monsieur Winslow . " " Oh ? " " As you are doubtless aware , our national elections will be held on the tenth of May . The indications are that the government will prevail quite comfortably ... " " Oh ? " said Winslow again . " I 'd heard it would be quite close . " The minister looked at him narrowly . " My sources indicate otherwise , " he said coldly . " What concerns us here this morning is l'affaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winslow asked , at his most obtuse . The minister realized the interview was not going at all the way he 'd planned . Alors , if it 's to be an adversary proceeding .. . " Monsieur Winslow , my government do not intend that on the eve of the national election the Maison Fayol be sold to a foreign group . Nor that any suggestion the house may be sold in future be discussed publicly . Later on , after the election , well , that 's another matter . These things can be arranged . But for now , non , absolument non ! "  | " You have me at a disadvantage , Minister , " Winslow said mildly . " I am not negotiating a purchase of the House of Fayol or anything else . On behalf of any purchaser . " The Frenchman slammed his small fist on the large desk . " Semantics , " he shouted . " Semantics . Rousselot did n't send you here to sample the new vintages . We know that . . . . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather competent . " " So ? " The minister stood up . He was tired of looking up at Winslow . " Monsieur Winslow , you are a highly respected banker . Rousselot has a considerable reputation . Is n't there some accommodation two gentlemen can reach in this matter ? " " Such as ? " Winslow asked . " Take a fortnight 's holiday , " he said , speaking quickly as if sensing a sympathetic opening in Winslow 's manner . " After the elections , complete your negotiations . The Maison Fayol will still be there . Paris is not going to get out of the fashion business . Women will still buy perfume . The world will not end in the next few weeks . " " Suppose the government loses and the Front Populaire comes in ? Maybe they 'll nationalize . Where would I be then ? Assuming , of course , your thesis that I 'm interested in buying Fayol or anything ? " The cabinet minister walked around to Winslow 's side of the desk . " Such a preposterous remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . With something approaching candor for the first time since he 'd entered the room , Winslow said soberly , " Monsieur , I would always speak seriously with a member of the cabinet of France . " The minister seemed curiously pleased . " Will you be staying in Paris ? " he inquired . " Yes , " Winslow said . " I expect to be here . " He wondered if the question were simply a ranging shot or if he knew something , about Grasse , about Anouk , about the priest Masson.  | " And we can not come to an accommodation ? " Winslow resumed his earlier pose . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand , " he said . The minister stamped his foot . He did , he really did stamp his foot , Winslow thought . " I wo n't permit a sale ! I wo n't ! " he screamed . Innocently , Winslow inquired , " Does the Minister advise that I consult my embassy on this matter ? " The Frenchman breathed deeply . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , another " interview , " also bearing on the matter of the House of Fayol , took place in another quartier of Paris . It concerned two men who had attended the Graduate School of Business of Harvard University . One of them , the man who had sought the interview , was employed in Europe by a great American corporation . The other was Paul Delane.  | For all his ridiculous posturing , the minister had frightened Winslow . It was one thing to have good old Charlie Casey tell you the French government was opposed to your doing something . It was quite another to stand before a minister of France and be threatened . It was a healthy scare , an intelligent fright . Winslow was concentrating completely now , his senses heightened , the tension curiously pleasurable . It was a feeling he had known before . Briefly , in combat ; and then , sustained , over a longer period , with Rohatyn during the city crisis . Winslow knew the time had come to move . To move quickly . Staying away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delane . Delane would cover his tracks in Paris , leaving messages at the hotel to indicate Winslow was still in town : he was expected here for cocktails , there for dinner  --  a fragile stratagem but one that might provide a brief confusion . Delane was strangely argumentative . " Why ca n't I come with you ? I could be of immense help . " " Look , ' ' Winslow said patiently , " stay in Paris and cover me . Keep an eye on Nafredi . Keep tabs on Max . I do n't need you down south . " " Where will you be staying ? " " Oh , hell , Paul . I du n no . " Delane paused . " You do n't even have a gun , I 'll bet . "  | " A gun ? " Winslow said . " I have n't even held a gun in ten years . What the hell would I do with a gun ? " " You could shoot somebody , " Delane suggested . Winslow sighed . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't carry a gun . I was only a kid . " He brightened . " Antoine , why ca n't I go with you ? Then , if you do n't want to shoot somebody , I could do it on your behalf . " " This is what comes of permitting fashion designers to attend Harvard , " Winslow told him . Delane made Winslow promise to keep in touch . " I should know where you are at all times , " he said . " Sure , sure , " Winslow said impatiently . " Do you have any contacts with the minister ? " " That fascist ! " Delane spat out . " What would a good socialist like me have in common with a capitalist-roader like that ? " He went up to the Vogue studio to see Marianna . Avedon was shooting some pictures . When Winslow started to talk , Marianna hushed him . " For god 's sake , " she hissed , " not while Avedon is shooting . " Winslow paced up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was gorgeous . He had a bad case of the guilts about Anouk . They went across the street for coffee . It was four thirty . Winslow told her about going to Grasse . With Anouk . " With Anouk ? You and that baby assassin alone in the south of France ? Ha ! " Winslow talked fast . " Look , Anouk 's essential . Two reasons . First , the old priest has this famous message for her . Spiritual guidance . ' That 's got to be these deeds or whatever that make Fayol so goddamn valuable . Paris One , ' if my instincts mean anything . And he sure as hell is n't going to turn them over to anyone but Jacques Fayol 's daughter . Second , if the paperwork looks legit , Anouk is the inheritor . She 's the only one who can talk sale . If she 's willing to sell , we can get a written commitment right on the spot , beat the election deadline , wrap up this goddamn mess , and go home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip could be dangerous ; two could move faster than three , Marianna had to work , a halfdozen other reasons she could n't go . Coolly , she dismantled his arguments . " Suppose you lose her . I could impersonate her . I can drive better than you . As for work , I could have my period . Everyone always takes off for that . And who says it 'll be dangerous ? The most dangerous part of this entire madness is that turkey , Anouk . " " Who said I was driving ? " " It 's logical . With the French sicking their hounds on you , they 'll have the airports and the trains under wraps . You got a cigarette ? " There was more of this . In the end Winslow surrendered . At six he phoned Anouk . She sounded very friendly . " I 'll come by about nine . That okay ? " " Mmmm , " she said . " I think it 's more than okay . I think it 's sensationelle ! " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was very low , almost sleepy . " Come as early as you want , " she said . " There were one or two things we neglected to do the other evening . " When Winslow hung up he had a vaguely dirty feeling . He 'd wanted to tell the girl to stop the shit , to turn off the electricity , and drop the Xaviera Hollander act . He wanted to tell her to be nineteen years old again . Instead , because the girl was unstable , because he needed her cooperation , he had said nothing . At the hotel there was a letter from Rousselot : " Why do n't you call me at home toward the end of the week . I do n't want a progress report . I just want to know your judgment as to whether all this huffing and puffing is constructive . " Well , Winslow thought as he packed his little Vuitton bag , by the end of the week , we ought to know . We surely ought . He took a cab to the rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was excited about the trip . She was in lean suede jeans and a pullover . Her hair was pulled back . She looked very good .  | " My car 's gassed and ready , " she said . " Well , let 's see . Maybe Anouk will want to use hers . It 's a Lancia . " Marianna looked at him . " You sound like an account executive I used to know . " Winslow ignored the sarcasm . He was looking out the window . He saw the men . " Those sons of bitches , " he said . " Listen , show me the back way out . Then , after a couple of minutes , go in the bedroom and make a big deal about going to bed and turn off the lights . Maybe they 'll think we 're in the pad . " " Okay , " she said . She did n't sound sleepy or petulant or teasing . Nothing like Anouk . She just sounded as if she knew what he was asking and what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winslow nodded , still watching the street , " Yeah , " he said , " scotch . And let 's drink it in the bedroom . " They went down the hallway arm in arm . It felt comfortable . Right . The drapes were only partially pulled in Marianna 's bedroom . " Leave them like that , " Winslow ordered . He took the girl in his arms and they kissed . When they broke , he loosened his collar . " Okay , now , where 's the back door ? " " Through the kitchen . Then down the stairs . You 'll come out in the cave . From there , there 's an alleyway . " He nodded . " Now kiss me once more and I 'll act as if I 'm going to the bathroom . I 'll call you from Anouk 's . For God 's sake , do n't tie up the phone . " She kissed him and he went out of the bedroom , peeling off his shirt , as if preparing for bed . Marianna waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall switch and flipped off the overhead light . The two bed lamps bathed the room in a warm glow . Marianna stretched and then pulled her sweater over her head . In a doorway across the street stood two men . Without being obvious about it , Marianna could not know if they were reacting . Being a woman , she was certain they were . She heard the kitchen door close . Winslow was out ! Now , to keep the watchers amused . And keep them across the street and not snooping around the alley . Marianna walked back across the  | room to the dresser , making sure the open blind kept her in view . She lighted a cigarette , breathed in deeply , and blew out the smoke . She looked down at her breasts , as if to examine them , and picked up the bottle of Y perfume . She moistened both forefingers and then slowly rubbed the perfume into her nipples . Now , one of the men moved . Then the other . She recoiled fora moment , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only moving to where they could watch her better . The perfume stung . But it felt good . The tension , the playacting , the silent watchers outside , provided a sensual excitement she could nearly taste . She wished Winslow were here now . It was impossible , she knew , but she wanted him . She shuddered slightly . The excitement was tangible now . She knew what she was going to do and the knowledge both frightened her and caused her to shiver with pleasure . Goddammit , Marianna , she thought , you dig this act . Winslow was by now three blocks away . He 'd gotten through the alleyway , scaring himself when a cat darted between his legs , and had avoided the brightly lighted Avenue Mozart . He picked up a cab just short of the avenue and gave the driver Anouk 's address . He hoped to hell Marianna was putting on a convincing shadow play . " Jean-Pierre , regarde ! " One of the two watchers poked the other . Marianna had undone the waistband of the suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs , her back to the open window . When they were off she stood there for a moment in her bikini pants and then turned to the window , yawning rather theatrically . The watchers were a good audience . They did n't notice the overplaying . They were looking at the rest of her . Marianna picked up a drink , it was Winslow 's , and took a long sip . The maneuver lifted one breast . The second watcher groaned with pleasure . " Ah , " he said , " quelle poitrine . " Anouk was stoned . " It 's something new , " she told Winslow . He stood awkwardly in the middle of the living room wondering how a merchant  | banker from New York got into these things . Anouk was wearing a T-shirt and jeans . She looked happy but stupid-happy . She had a glass in her hand . " Have some ? " she asked . " No , " Winslow said curtly , not sure whether she meant a drink or the " new " drug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't hurt , " the girl said . " They 're just pills . You pop them . And they pop you . " She laughed . " Anouk , " Winslow said , " I want you to drive down to Grasse with me . To see Canon Masson . About your father 's message . It 's important . " " Do n't want to go anywhere , " she said . " Just to bed and fuck . But you 've got to try this stuff too . It 's sensational . " Winslow nodded . " Yeah , I want to . And we will . But later . In Grasse , or we could stop at a hotel along the way . " She shook her head , the silly smile still on her face . " Bed , " she said . Then she brightened even more . " Or did you want to do it in the bath ? We did n't do it there last night . " She paused . " Did we ? " " Anouk , this thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , angry now , the little girl deprived of a favorite toy . " I 'm sick of Grasse . Sick of my father . I do n't want to see any old priest . I want ... " Winslow blew up . " Goddammit , you little bitch . This is something we 're going to do . And we 're going to do it if I have to slug you first . " She licked her lips . " Do you want me to put on my leather underwear ? " When she asked that , momentarily she sounded sober . Then , without saying anything else , she crumbled into a graceful heap on the floor . Marianna was naked now . The two watchers had moved again , getting a better angle on the bedroom . They were watching her and talking out of the corners of their mouths , exchanging rather specialized commentary on her anatomy and the various attitudes they might like to see her assume .  | " Jean-Pierre ? " the one said . His voice was huskier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think would happen  --  I mean , what would the boss say if we went up there ? " Jean-Pierre laughed . It was a rough laugh . " He 'd have our balls , " he offered . The other man shrugged . " I 've had my balls cut off by bosses before , to sais . " " Alors , " Jean-Pierre said , " me , I 've got only two . I have to be more prudent than you . " " No , wait a minute , " the other one said . " I 'm serious . We go up there , beat up the American , take the girl , have some fun . " " And what do we tell the boss ? " " Shit , we tell him they tried to get away . The guy pulled a knife , a gun , whatever ; we did n't want to lose them . Meanwhile we take the girl . " Jean-Pierre again demonstrated his prudence . " The American , " he said , " he 's a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window he could see Marianna drain a glass . Then , moving across the room , she turned off the light . The watcher was decided then . " We 'll give them ten minutes . Let him get the girl warmed up . Then we go in . " Jean-Pierre licked his lips . He did n't like it , he did n't like it at all . The boss had very little patience with this sort of amateur behavior among his professionals . Still , he remembered the girl 's flat belly and those long legs and how the breasts rose . " D'accord , " he said . " In ten minutes . " Jean-Pierre 's partner looked pleased . His name was Emile and he was quite ugly and he had never had a girl who looked as good as this one . Winslow had picked up Anouk Fayol and laid her on the couch . He went into the bathroom . Jesus , he thought , it 's a goddamn pharmacy . He had no idea what she had taken ; what , if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles of  | pills , rummaged among the cocaine straws and the powders , opened a charming ceramic jar and found marijuana . He returned to the living room . Anouk was smiling in her sleep , her lips just slightly parted , the way a child sleeps . He felt her face . It was cool . Her breathing was regular , her pulse normal . He went into the kitchen and poured himself another scotch , this one straight . Then he went back into the living room and again examined the girl . Well , he thought , now she ca n't argue the point . Now she has to go to Grasse . He lighted a cigar and picked up the phone to dial Marianna 's number . Jean-Pierre and the other watcher crossed the street . JeanPierre pushed the button and the heavy iron door unlatched . There was a small glass elevator on the right . They passed it and walked carefully up the carpeted stairs to the first floor . Marianna 's front door was one of those big , heavy double wooden affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large blade . He wiggled it into the gap between the lock and the door , and then , finding the angle he sought , he leaned his body weight against the knife and there was a sharp , metallic crack . He kept the knife out and turned the doorknob with his free hand . It opened . Marianna 's bedroom was along the hallway on the left . The two men moved silently along the bare hardwood of the hallway , Jean-Pierre in the lead . A floorboard creaked and he looked over his shoulder nervously . smile , just behind him , was grinning . He put his hand to his groin and mimed masturbation . Jean-Pierre shook his head and turned forward again . God knows , he wanted the girl too , but this one , this one was an animal . He wondered if they could catch the American unaware . He hoped the couple were fucking . It would make it easier . He slid the .45 automatic from his shoulder holster and tiptoed toward the bedroom door . He hoped the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be much fun to have to knock her out before they could start to play .  | Winslow ransacked the armoire in Anouk 's bedroom and found a large canvas tote bag . He threw in some slacks , a pair of shoes , some blouses , and a couple of sweaters . He found a bikini in the dresser and some underwear . He should put in some cosmetics , he supposed , but she would just have to use Marianna 's . He could n't begin to choose between the jars and tubes . Then , remembering that they might have to drive through the mountains , he tossed in a down anorak . He stopped , thought for a moment , and went into the bathroom . He picked up the cocaine and a half dozen straws . He did n't like it , not one bit , but if it took that to keep the girl going during the next few days , well .. . He wished Marianna would get there . He wondered if she 'd been able to slip out through the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out . He relighted it and sat down in a deeply cushioned chair to wait . Across the room Anouk slept . Emile slipped past Jean-Pierre and gripped the doorknob to Marianna 's bedroom . He nodded at Jean-Pierre . It was unlocked . He held the knife low in his other hand . Jean-Pierre cocked the .45 . Emile bunched his shoulders and then , with a last nod to Jean-Pierre , he threw his weight against the door and it sprung open . The two men charged into the bedroom . It was empty . " Where the hell have you been ? " Winslow asked Marianna . She was staring at Anouk . " What 's the matter with her ? " " Stoned , " Winslow said . " What happened ? It 's nearly an hour since I called . " She shrugged . " It took me time to pack . " Winslow handed her a parking garage ticket . " ' We 'll take her Lancia . Here 's the ticket . And some money . Get it out of the garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled . Take the bags . I 'll carry her down and meet you at the front door . " Marianna nodded . She picked up Winslow 's bag and Anouk 's and then her own and looked at Winslow .  | ' ' I .... " " Yes ? " he asked . She shook her head . " Nothing . I 'll meet you in front . " She hurried out of the apartment , carrying the bags . She wondered why she had n't told him why she 'd been so long . She tried to smile about it . " An intellectual striptease , " she thought . But she remembered how it had excited her , how she had trembled with pleasure rather than fright , and she knew that was why she had n't told him . Winslow waited just inside the front door . Anouk stood upright in his arms . Anyone seeing them from any distance would have assumed they were lovers , that perhaps the girl had had a cognac too many . He heard the car pull up and he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one else on the street . Marianna jumped out and ran around to open the door . Winslow placed Anouk as gently as he could on the back seat while Marianna stowed the luggage . He got into the driver 's seat and checked the gauges . Everything looked all right . He turned to Marianna . " Ready ? " She smiled and nodded . He turned once more to the back seat and then got out of the car and pulled off his suit coat . He tossed it over the girl 's sleeping form . She stirred slightly and then mumbled something . Marianna turned to Anouk , and the girl , still asleep , said something else . Quite clearly . Marianna sat up straight and turned to stare through the windshield . What Anouk Fayol had said was directed to Winslow . What she had said , in that most colloquial of French slang phrases , was that Tony Winslow should fuck her . " Again . " Four hours later they were nearing Lyons . He and Marianna had alternated every hour at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still set . He lighted two cigarettes and passed one to her . She took it without a word . The road was clear , the sky starry . The great belly of France raced past on either side . The car performed beautifully . In the back seat Anouk  | slept . Shit , Winslow told himself , they had to talk sometime . " Look , I 'm sorry . I should have told you . It was a situation in which . . . " " You do n't have to explain , " Marianna said coldly . " I quite understand . " " The hell you do . We needed this girl . She , well , I know it sounds corny , but there was nothing I could do but go to bed with her . " Marianna 's cool smashed . " Damn you , Tony . Do n't give me these phony euphemisms . Go to bed with her ' ! Why ca n't you say what you mean ? You screwed her , you fucked her , you .. . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too . " He was angry now too . " You 're right . I did . I did enjoy it . " " Was it tonight ? Was that when you did it ? While she was getting high ? " " What does it matter when I did it ? " He sounded unhappy . " Oh , nothing . It does n't matter at all . " She was thinking of the view into her bedroom , of the watchers across the street , and of how she had taken off her clothes and rubbed her breasts and performed nude for those creepy bastards just to give Winslow the breathing space he 'd needed . Marianna took a drag on the cigarette . Calmer now , thinking of her own exhibitionism , of the pleasure she 'd taken in it and her failure to mention it to Winslow , she said , less bitterly : " But with that teenage junkie ! That 's what hurts . A goddamn cheap little call girl ! " Winslow sensed an easing in the tension . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gets a hundred dollars a trick . " When he looked at Marianna she was trying not to smile . South of Lyons they stayed on route seven . Winslow was driving now . Marianna slept , her head on his shoulder . At six in the morning they stopped at a cafe and had coffee and cheese and used the bathrooms . Anouk was still asleep . At eight they were in Grasse . They got directions to the church at a gas station . Win-  | slow got out and went to what seemed to be the rectory . He was not yet sure how he was going to explain Anouk 's being unconscious . Well , with a priest perhaps the truth would obtain . An elderly woman came to the door . No , Canon Masson was not there . He was away for the day . Winslow slumped , tired from the long drive , from the tensions of the night . Damn , why was n't the priest where he should be at eight o'clock in the morning ? " Can you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head . Then Winslow turned solemn . " It is a matter , " he said , " of spiritual guidance . The young woman in my car and I . . . well , we . . . " The old woman stared through her glasses at Marianna , sitting in the Lancia . She could not see Anouk . " Ah , well then , if it 's a spiritual matter , of course . Canon Masson is in Cannes . " " In Cannes ? " She nodded . " He goes to Cannes every year in May . " " Oh ? " Winslow said , feeling stupidly that he was missing something . " But do n't you know ? " the old woman said . " He goes to Cannes every year during the film festival . He goes to demonstrate against obscenity in the cinema . " Eighty miles from Grasse a big Citroen DS barreled south along route seven . Jean-Pierre slept in the back seat . Emile was at the wheel . He was still thinking about Marianna and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifty thousand inhabitants on the Mediterranean coast in the shadow of Nice . Winslow drove the car through Grasse to route N. 567 and headed south . It was only seventeen kilometres , according to the signpost . Anouk was still curled up in the back seat of the Lancia , but now she woke . " Alors , " she said . Marianna turned in her seat . " If you say where am I ? ' I 'm going to slug you . " She turned back to Winslow . " That okay ? " " Perfect , " Winslow said . " You 're a credit to Vogue . " He decided they should stop for a council of war , lay their plans for finding Masson , and what they should say when they got to him . Pretty vague stuff , trying to find a French priest picketing a film festival . Well , their luck had held so far . They came into Cannes and hit the usual traffic . Winslow bore off to the east , and when they reached the waterfront he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on , " he said , " let 's get something to drink . " The two girls got out of the car . The waterfront loungers watched them appreciatively . The cafe was pleasant , sun-filled . They sat down at a white metal table and ordered . The jukebox was playing something by Regine . Winslow looked around . The place had a preseason feel to it , the waiter still  | attentive , eager , the barman rubbing the bar top and looking pleasant . Later , when the season had really started , you would be fortunate to get them to scowl at you . " Could someone please tell me . . . " Anouk began . " You were stoned , " Winslow said . " Out . Dead . Crocked . You really dig the stuff , do n't you ? " " It passes the time , " she said . " Like solitaire , " Marianna said sweetly . Winslow hoped she was n't going to be too tough on the kid . They still needed her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go to the police , you know . " " Kidnapping ' is a bit strong , " Winslow said . " Oh , Tony , " Marianna interrupted , " stop mincing words . Yes , we put on the snatch . You were too stoned to make it on your own . You 're damn lucky . If we 'd left you in Paris you might be dead by now . Like old . . . what 's his name ? " " Grumbach , " Winslow offered . Marianna really had quite a gift for this sort of thing . They must be doing marvelous things with the curriculum at Yale these days . " All to find Canon Masson , " Anouk said . Winslow nodded . " To find him and find out what this ' guidance ' was your father talked about . " Anouk was quite awake now . She slid closer to Winslow and her leg bumped against his . Looking at Marianna out of the corner of her eye she said , " Well , of course , if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " merde " soundlessly with her lips . Then Anouk got up . " I 'll be right back , " she said . She started for the toilets . " Go with her , " Winslow hissed . " We ca n't have her snorting more coke . " " Go with her ? I just might drown her . " " Dainmit , Marianna , that girl is ... " Marianna got up . " I know , I know . " She followed Anouk . The barman looked very happy . He wondered if they were cinema stars , the two young women . Already it was starting . And usually  | the stars kept to the center of town and not out here at the fringe . He smiled at Winslow . What a fortunate man to have two such . He wondered if Winslow slept with them simultaneously or one at a time . The girls returned . The adaptable Anouk had slid into another of her unpredictable moods , this one of complete cooperation . " I 'm curious myself about Masson . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In order that they not take her completely for granted , Anouk needled Marianna . " Myself , I find fashion magazines superficial . And most fashion editors pathetic social climbers . " Marianna smiled sweetly . " I suppose one comes by such knowledge at Madame Claude 's . " While they finished their drinks Winslow laid out the plan . It was very simple . They would find Masson ; Anouk would identify herself ; they would ask about " spiritual guidance . " If that fell flat , they would engage him in conversation about the late Fayol , the old days , those cheerful times in the war , and casually Winslow would slip in a mention of " Paris One . " It was very simple . Winslow had an uneasy idea it would turn out to be not simple at all . The festival was coming into bloom . There were lots of flags . Banners were strung across the streets and on the facades of the hotels and the movie houses where the films would be shown . One of the banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars on billboards and temporary hoardings . Raquel Welch looked splendid with bosoms a meter across . The blowups did very little for Barbra Streisand 's nose . In another day or two you would n't be able to drive a car along the Croisette . Now it was just passable . Winslow drew up in front of the hotel where the festival was headquartered . " Marianna , go ask . I 'll stay with Anouk in the car . " Marianna got out . For the first time she felt silly . Inside the hotel she went up to the concierge . " Je m'excuse , mais y a-t-il un pretre qui manifeste contre le ... ? "  | The concierge did not permit her to finish . Was there a priest demonstrating against the festival ? Was there not ? It was Canon Masson , bien sur , down from the hills for his annual manifestation . There could not be a festival without the good canon ! Why , the governors would not permit it to begin without him . " Then where is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yachts , " he said . " That of MGM or Joe Levine or Roman Polanski or . . . " One could never be sure with Canon Masson . He liked to give generously of himself so that no one would be slighted , not even the Hollywood trash . Marianna thanked him and went back to the car . Anouk had climbed into the front seat . Her tan looked lovely under the hot sun of the Midi , while Marianna had the uncomfortable suspicion her own nose was beginning to redden . Grumpily she got into the jump seat and told Winslow about the yachts . He shook his head . " Hell of a way to protest obscenity . " They drove out onto one of the wharves that advertised speedboats . Winslow parked the car . " Bring your suits , " he said . " You never know . We might have to swim for it . " The lovely little harbor was full of yachts . While Winslow dickered with the patron of speedboats , the two women asked about the priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sam Creel , " Anouk reported . " Creel ? " Winslow demanded . " That son of a bitch has n't made anything that was n't X-rated in years . Maybe never . " Marianna smiled . " What better place to mount his protest ? " The speedboat was one of those wonderfully lacquered old mahogany affairs they do n't make anymore . The patron of speedboats had refused to rent them the boat without a driver . The driver wore a beret and a dark-blue suit and tie and looked retarded . He was perhaps seventy years old . Winslow whispered to the patron . " Is he okay ? " nodding at the man . " Our finest speedboat driver , " the patron assured him . " In the  | war he commanded a cruiser . Got sunk at Mers-el-Kebir . Very brave fellow . " The speedboat pulled away from the dock at approximately forty knots . Jesus , Winslow thought , I hope we do n't hit something . The old man turned as if to reassure him and grinned his idiot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Tony , " Marianna asked , " are there sharks ? " Anouk laughed . This was her kind of scene . Winslow wondered if somehow she 'd sneaked a snort . " Par-a-mount , " the old man said , pointing while he spun the wheel with one hand and almost dropped Winslow overboard . " Bon . Arretes ici . " They drifted up to the big white ship with the motor cut , and when a sailor peered down at him Winslow shouted up that they were looking for Canon Masson . The sailor cupped an ear . Then a very pretty blonde with long hair and huge sunglasses leaned over the rail . She was naked from the waist up and possibly below . " Come aboard , " she said in Swedish-accented English . " We 're looking for the priest , " Winslow said , staring at the girl 's nipples . " A priest ? " the girl said , confused . " We need him for the last rites , " Marianna said , somewhat sourly . The blonde shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . They say he 's very religious . " Winslow signaled the speedboat driver and the old man threw in the clutch . They all sat down abruptly as the boat roared off . The blonde was still waving . Her breasts moved beautifully in the afternoon sun . " I 'm going to get out of my clothes too , " Anouk announced . " Where now ? " the old man demanded . " Le bateau de Samuel Creel , " Winslow ordered . Anouk took off her shirt . She was n't wearing a bra . " Jesus , " Winslow said . The old man had turned from the  | wheel and was gaping . The speedboat headed directly for a yacht showing British colors . " Well , I will too , " said Marianna . She started to unzip her pants . The old man left the wheel entirely . " Alors , " Winslow shouted . The old man smiled wetly and held his hands out , palms upward . Reluctantly he turned back to the wheel and they missed the British boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazer took his pipe out of his mouth and shouted something . Winslow assumed it was uncomplimentary . Anouk and Marianna were both down to their panties now . Marianna dug into the tote bag . " Here , " she said , tossing a bikini to Anouk . She pulled out a bikini top and put it on . Then the bottom . She looked pale but fine . Anouk looked at the bikini she 'd drawn and pulled off her panties . Her tan was startling against the tiny white strip . She tugged on the bikini bottom and tossed the top back toward the bag . " In the Midi no one under thirty wears the bra , " she said , looking meaningfully at Marianna . " Bullshit , " said Marianna . But she kept her top on . Sam Creel 's yacht was even bigger than Paramount 's . Unlike the others in the harbor , it was pale blue . It showed the usual flags and a giant banner with the initials " S. C. " There was a landing stage and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Anouk . Marianna , with her top on , had been forgotten . The old man licked his lips . The speedboat lost headway and bobbed up and down abeam the landing stage . A uniformed sailor held them off with a long gaff , waiting for instructions . A bald head appeared over the rail . " Yes ? " he said . Winslow guessed this was Creel . " Hello , there . I 'm Anthony Winslow . From Rousselot &; Partners in New York . I heard you were out here and I ... " Creel was looking at the two girls . At Marianna . But even more at Anouk . Winslow realized she was still topless . He resumed . " I believe we have mutual acquaintances who ... "  | " Yes , yes , " Creel said , " of course . Do come aboard . " They moored the boat and the old man was told to wait . He looked unhappy to see the women leave . Creel was at the top of the ladder to greet them . Talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " It is always pleasant to meet an associate of Henry Rousselot . " Winslow and the girl were not the only travelers from Paris who had come to Cannes . Aboard the yacht of Sepp Gardolfi , the ill Italian producer , Zader Nafredi was enjoying a siesta . Only he was not alone in the big stateroom bed . With him were Soroya , the Iranian mannequin from the Maison Fayol , and a little blond German actress who was in Gardolfi 's party . The German girl , whom Gardolfi thought very promising indeed , was kneeling between Soroya 's legs . Nafredi was observing . He tended to agree the girl was promising . She was , after all , only sixteen . On the same yacht , working on his suntan , was the most famous of Fayol 's " little monks , " Max , interim director of the great fashion house . Why was Max in Cannes , on the same yacht as the Shah 's man , Nafredi ? Max would have laughed at the question . He was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cannes than to brood in Paris where malicious folk might suggest one had not gotten an invitation , not one , to someone 's yacht in Cannes . There was an additional reason : He was there because Nafredi had paid him to be there . On yet another yacht , her own , was Maggy Moal , flanked by several of her mannequins , swilling beer , chain-smoking , and rasping orders to her captain to keep steam up lest the political crisis force them beyond the three-mile limit into the safety of international waters . Maggy 's yacht , which she rarely used , was a converted destroyer painted white , with a crew of ninety . Now she reclined on a chaise in the shade of a striped awning , asking questions and shouting directions to her valet , who dutifully focused a high-powered telescope on the other yachts and reported to his mistress who was clad , who was naked , which famous  | actress was going to fat , and which movie producer was oiling the back of which young starlet not his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports left to Maggy Moal . Tony Winslow , Anouk Fayol , and Marianna Troy lounged comfortably in the sun on the flying bridge of Mr. Sam Creel 's 4,500-ton yacht . Young Italian girls made up in sarongs and leis to portray Polynesian maidens passed around the drinks . Mr. Creel , who suffered from duodenal difficulties , drank milk . The Reverend Canon Masson , a huge man in sandals and a black cassock , fanned himself with a straw hat , puffed on an impressively long cigar , and accepted another drink . Piled neatly by the priest 's deck chair was a stack of printed leaflets urging strict censorship of films and television . " Canon Masson and I have argued the point for years , " Creel was saying . " My conscience is clear . I sleep like a babe . Wickedness is undeniably in the eye of the beholder . " The priest laughed . " There is weakness in all of us , Monsieur Creel . It came in the same post as original sin . " A lean young man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of gold chains twisted his fingers in the long hair of a girl who sat at his feet drinking Coca-Cola . He was the Communist candidate for Grasse in the coming election . He creased his suntanned brow . " Canon Masson and I are at opposite poles on most questions , " he said . " The election , for example . His obsolete regard for the late de Gaulle for another . But on film festivals and dirty movies , he and I are as one . Solidarity forever . " He melded his hands together . Creel scowled . " But why ? Movies , images on the wall , shadow play , what are they but an entertainment , a divertissement ? Harmless in themselves . Light and shadow . Chiaroscuro . What damage is there ? " Anouk had taken one of the leis and in deference to the priest had arranged it rather attractively over her nipples . Now she leaned close to Winslow and whispered .  | " By any chance do you have a joint ? " Winslow shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was clearly unstable . She was also crucial to their chances of recruiting Masson to the cause . Anouk sulkily moved away from Winslow . He could see Creel eyeing her . " I do n't understand , " Marianna was saying to the communist , " why you 're against the festival . I appreciate Father Masson 's objections . But not yours . " The young man smiled . He had nice teeth . It was easy to see why he got votes . " Mademoiselle , " he said , " this may sound bizarre to an American convinced that all Communists are godless and immoral . The truth is , we are godless and disgustingly moral . Where Canon Masson finds dirty films obnoxious to his god , I find them obnoxious to the people . So , for different reasons , we are both enemies of our host , Monsieur Creel . " " Then why , " Winslow asked , " do you pass the day on his yacht ? " The Communist laughed . " Because neither of us has a yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Winslow murmured . Creel was watching Anouk . " My dear , " he said , " have you done any film work ? " " A few private movies , " she replied obscurely . Winslow could imagine what they were . Creel looked confused , not knowing what to make of her . Anouk stood up . The lei did n't do her body any harm . None at all . " I 'm sleepy , " she said . " Is there somewhere I might ... " Creel jumped up . " There are several unoccupied cabins , " he said . " Permit me . " They disappeared into one of the corridors . Marianna looked at Winslow , an eyebrow raised . He nodded " Okay , " relieved Anouk was at least temporarily offstage . Now was his chance to talk to Masson . He got the priest off into a corner of the deck . " I wonder if I might speak with you , privately . "  | The canon waved a big hand . " But of course . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marianna and the Communist were talking politics , Creel 's other guests appeared occupied . Well , he thought , here goes . Then , just as he began , Masson looked over his shoulder and held up a hand . Sam Creel had returned , alone . " She really did want to sleep , " he said , incredulous . Masson beamed . " The young , they need more sleep than old fellows like us . " Creel was comforted , at least slightly . He slung an arm around the priest 's ample shoulder . " My best friend and source of inspiration , " he said expansively . Marianna wrinkled her nose . " With due respect to your friendship , " she said , " I still do n't understand how a priest demonstrating against pornography can spend his afternoon on a pornographer 's yacht . " The producer looked hurt . Masson , however , smiled tolerantly . " Mademoiselle , " he said , " in our baptismal vows we pledge to renounce Satan and all his works and pomps . I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I renounce them . But not the poor , misguided chap who produces them . " The Communist laughed . " What sublime casuistry . I am stunned . You should really be in politics . " The priest shrugged . " You and I are both in the business of providing conviction to the undecided . You in politics , I in another realm . " The Communist shook his head . " What I do n't understand is how such an intelligent man can testify to superstition , to gods he can not see , address himself to souls he can not touch , to spirits and dominions invisible to rational men . I simply do n't understand it . " Masson thought for a moment . " Monsieur , " he said , " it is true I believe in a god I can not see . Yet I know Him to be . " He  | paused . " Consider yourself . You have never seen your asshole and yet you know it to exist . " Maggy Moal crinkled her nose . " What species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discharging merde into the harbor . " The valet 's eyes widened . He stared at Maggy 's lap , where blue smoke wreathed up from the burning wool . She had set herself afire once again . " Madame , " he said sharply . " ill Maggy shrieked at him . " Get back to the telescope , you . Do you deprive me of the simplest of pleasures ? " The valet 's eyes remained wide , but docilely he turned toward the glass . Maggy Moal waved a hand impatiently in front of her . " They must be burning garbage , " she remarked . " The air is full of smoke . " Cocktails were being served on Sam Creel 's yacht . Winslow was at last alone with Canon Masson . " Canon , " he said quickly , " we must see you privately . It concerns Jacques Fayol and his daughter . " " His daughter ? " Winslow nodded . ' The girl who is asleep . She is here to see you . It concerns her . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherubic charm . He looked shrewdly into Winslow ' s eyes . Then , making a judgment based on what he saw there , or failed to see there , he said , " Alors , wake the girl . "  | The helicopter taking Maggy Moal to the burn center at Marseilles passed over the speedboat at five o'clock in the afternoon . Nobody looked up . The boatman was in something of a sulk . Anouk , in deference to the hour , or to Canon Masson , had shed her floral arrangement and had tied on her bikini bra . They paid off the boatman and crossed the Croisette . Masson led the procession . " My motorcycle and picketing equipment , " he apologized , " I left them at the Splendide . " Since the Hdtel Splendide was the headquarters of the festival , and since Masson was dedicated to its forcible closure , Winslow thought this was chutzpah indeed , if a Catholic priest could be said to possess " chutzpah . " In front of the hotel there was a promising little demonstration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that some species of Czech had won one of the minor awards over an Italian competitor . The Italian claque was manifesting its displeasure . Canon Masson , his great stomach preceding him , waded through the demonstrators , making signs of the cross and giving benediction as he went . " Bless you , my son , " he said to a young man who was spitting at one of the jury . The young man fell to his knees , blessed himself hastily , and got up to spit again .  | Masson turned to Winslow and beamed . " Is n't it splendid to see such fervor ? " he asked . Winslow nodded . " I 'd feared our young people had become so obsessed with material things , " Masson said piously , " that they had abandoned completely the joy of aesthetic polemic . " Just then a rioter , perhaps more than normally inspired by the aesthetics , threw a punch at Masson . The old priest slipped the blow and dug a stiff hand , palm rigid and fingers extended , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , stunned . " Qu'est-ce qui arrive ? " he asked , gasping for breath . " Bless you , " Masson intoned . " Bless you . " He shoved another demonstrator from his path and they reached the railing where his motorcycle and a number of furled signs were parked . " Can we get all this in your car ? " Masson inquired . " I dislike these roads after dark . My headlamp is a feeble thing . " They shoved the signs in the trunk and lashed the motorcycle on the back bumper . The Mediterranean sun blazed down . The girls got in the back seat and Masson arranged his skirts and sat up front with Winslow . The American started the car and slowly nudged his way through the crowd and up out of the town and toward the road to Grasse . He did not notice the two men in cheap suits who climbed into their Citroen DS and set off behind him . The sun was low over the hills when Winslow drove into Grasse . They dropped Canon Masson at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being very pleasant , refreshed from her nap and the sun and as enthusiastic about their mission as Winslow . Marianna and Anouk went off chatting like friends to their room . Masson had asked them to dine with him at nine . The American peeled off his clothes and left a call for eight thirty . He was immediately asleep . Jean-Pierre and Emile parked the Citroen on a side street and went into a cafe across the Boulevard jeu du Ballon . They or-  | dered mares and Jean-Pierre drank off his right away and went off to telephone . Emile sat at a table by the window and watched the entrance to the hotel . The marc warmed his belly . He was tired . He needed a bath and a shave . And he was still angry about Paris , about the empty bedroom , about the slim American girl . Well , he consoled himself , now there were two of them . And the second , if it were possible , as good-looking as the first . He did not yet know her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fayol would look stripped naked . Jean-Pierre came back to the table . He ordered a second mare . " Well ? " Emile asked . " We wait , " Jean-Pierre said . " There 's some sort of document , a deed or letter or something . That 's what they 're here to find . We wait until they do . " Emile nodded . That was simple enough to understand . " Then what ? " he asked . Jean-Pierre waited until the waiter had put down the drinks and gone off . " Then we take the document from them and go back to Paris with it . " " And that 's all ? " Emile asked , incredulous . Jean-Pierre nodded . " What else ? " he wanted to know . Emile smiled . It was not a very winning smile . " Oh , I might be able to think of something , " he said . Jean-Pierre sipped the second drink . God knows , they were good-looking girls and he had no love for the tall American . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like this , with his brains in his scrotum , you never knew . When he noticed that Emile was staring out of the window , Jean-Pierre eased the flap of his shoulder holster . He was glad Emile was a knife man , that he did n't carry a gun . In a situation like this you went for the money , the papers , the key , whatever it was the boss sent you after . You got that first . Then , if it was convenient , you fucked a girl or beat the shit out of someone who had given you trouble . But first , you did your work , you carried out the assignment . The amusements came later . Emile was still looking through the  | window . Jean-Pierre decided against having another marc . With an animal like this one , he wanted a clear head . Canon Masson poured the wine . " Of course this is n't first-rate country for decent wine , " he was saying . " Too hot , too much clay in the soil . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to have my hectares in grapes . But ... " He spread his hands . " It would n't do for the pastor of Grasse to be quoted thus . " Winslow was at the foot of fhe table from fhe priest . Anouk and Marianna , wearing cotton dresses against the heat of the southern evening , sat one on each side . The meal , cane d'agneau and fresh asparagus , had been fine . Winslow felt better after the nap , after the meal . He offered a cigar to Masson and the priest took it . " With all my vices , " he said , " it 's a good thing God is allmerciful . Simple justice , in my case , would be condemnatory . " Winslow wondered at what point it would be appropriate to get Masson back to the reason they had come . Then , as if sensing the moment , Anouk asked : " What about this message my father sent through old Grumbach ? This business of coming to you for spiritual guidance ? " Masson puffed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon my rudeness , but these are areas of a rather personal nature , and I 'm not sure that you wish me to ... " Anouk smiled . " Monsieur Winslow and Mademoiselle Troy are good friends . They helped me to get here . You may speak freely in front of them . " " Bien , " Masson said , and he sat forward in his armchair , his great arms resting on the table . " I knew your father first in the late thirties , just before the second war . He would come to Grasse on business , the usual trafficking with the attar merchants , the farmers who grow the flowers . We were not close . He was a most cosmopolitan sort , charming , obviously intelligent , vigorous , and already quite successful . He enjoyed his table , his vintage , his . . . women . I , on the other hand , a country priest .  | " Alors , in the course of things , the war came . At first we were not greatly affected here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less bitter about the defeat and the Occupation , one was vaguely aware of this fellow de Gaulle issuing grand statements from London . Grasse was part of the unoccupied zone . Oh , there were Germans about , but almost never in uniform . No jackboots , no Deutschland fiber Alles , ' no swastikas , no roundups of Jews . There was rationing , there were limitations on political activity , there was the occasional troublemaker hauled off to prison for some inconsequential act or other , but it was our own authorities that did it . Frenchmen still governed Frenchmen . And if times were hard , well , we had the sense to realize they were much harder in the north . " From time to time Jacques Fayol , like a number of other Paris couturiers who chose to keep their doors open , would procure a pass from the Germans and come south to engage in a reasonable facsimile of the normal commerce . The Germans had an interest in maintaining the perfume trade . Like all tourists , they wanted an ounce or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period was of course very restricted . And occasionally Fayol , or any visitor , would be stuck here for a week or two , waiting for the laissez-passer to return to Paris . It was then he and I got to know one another well . Grasse was a quiet town , he was bored , and I was one of the few educated people in the vicinity . We began dining together , late nights over brandy , political discussions , arguments about . . . well , the nature of things . " Anouk interrupted . " But you were nothing alike . " " Oh , your father made that very point , mademoiselle . Many times . I can hear him now , sounding very much like you , very definite in his speech : " Ah , Masson , we have such different appetites , you and I. You lust for eternal pleasure and are willing to wait a lifetime to achieve it . I want a lifetime of pleasure and am more than willing to expiate eternally . ' " The priest paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were not all that different . That we were  | both passionate , intemperate men . Only our weaknesses differed . " " It 's so difficult , " Marianna said , " for someone of my generation to imagine those days . France occupied by a foreign enemy , people being sent to concentration camps , men being shot . It 's as if it all happened in another age , another century . " Masson laughed . " I am slightly older than you , mademoiselle , I lived through it and sometimes I do not believe it happened . " He drew in the cigar smoke and resumed . " In the north there were already the first stirrings of the Resistance . Men disappeared into the maquis or they sailed small boats to England or they talked their way out of the occupied zone and went through here headed for Afrique du Nord and eventually to de Gaulle . In Grasse , in much of Vichy , there was a good deal of tut-tutting about all this . I remember one friend of mine , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who would listen : ' It is we who requested the armistice . It is our law . A Frenchman who breaks the armistice , who fights against the Germans , is breaking not a Hitler law but a French one . He is , res ipsa loquitur , a bandit . ' There were many who considered de Gaulle a bandit , an opportunist , an ambitious careerist who saw in the debacle of 1940 the chance to advance himself out of obscurity . And even for those who did not take such a harsh view , what was a man to do who had a wife and children to feed , bank loans to repay , a farm to work , employees to pay ? He had to work each day , and leave the maquis to the disaffected , the poseur , the unbalanced , the repressed criminal . " He nodded . " I can tell you there are Frenchmen today who will still tell you , in all sincerity , that it took greater courage to collaborate , to try to keep a wounded France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip into the maquis and shoot German boys in the back on dark nights . " " They also serve ... ' " Winslow quoted . " Precisely , " Masson said . " Now , I did not feel that way . But I understood . At least I did until 1942 . " " What happened then ? " Marianna asked . " North Africa was invaded by the Americans and the British , and in retaliation , or for strategic reasons , the Germans occupied  | the rest of France . For the first time there were soldiers in Grasse . The town was too small to sustain a Gestapo office , but there was one in Nice ; and occasionally there would come the knock on the door and one of our neighbors , some man I knew personally , would be taken away . The Jews were rounded up . The woman who had sold me my vegetables in the market , the man who soled my shoes , a teller at the bank  --  they were taken away . " So " ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Grasse . Mind you , " he said , " it was not as if every day there were bombs being thrown and tanks in the streets . No . The overwhelming impression was one of a sort of forced tranquility , an artificial peace . Farmers went into the fields to work , the construction of a small bridge over the river continued , policemen put on their uniforms and went on duty and gave out traffic tickets or arrested drunks . One saw Germans , but we had always had foreigners here in the tourist season . The flowers were harvested , the oils were extracted , the merchants from Paris came to town and stayed in the same hotels des commerciants , deals were made , houses were bought and sold , the children attended school , there was music on the radio . In the summer it was hot , in the winter cold and wet . And yet " ? Masson flicked his cigar ash and paused dramatically , a practiced sermonizer who knew the value of a pause ? " and yet , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winslow asked , as entranced by the telling as he earlier had been by the mystery of Fayol 's message to his daughter . " Well , sir , it was like this , " the priest said , very much the good storyteller appreciating the timely question , " there was tension . Tension and always tension . And of course , to sais , now we also , like our brothers in the rest of France , we also had the Resistance . " He rang a little bell and the old woman-servant came into the dining room . " There is still some brandy ? " he inquired . " Oui , Monseigneur , mais . . . " Masson slammed a big hand down on the table . " My good woman , " he said impatiently , " I know very well it is not good for my liver . However . . . " The servant dove into a cupboard and emerged with a bottle of  | old brandy , unlabeled . She set out some small ponies and poured . " Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that this country brew would be the death of me . I am sure he was correct . I only regret , " he said with sincerity , " that he did not remain to witness the event . " Canon Masson mused for several moments . Winslow wondered if indeed the priest was drunk , if his story would now drift off into country none of them could navigate , into the half-remembered reminiscences of the old , the tired , and the drunk . Instead , Masson put down his glass and resumed , if anything , more lucidly and less discursively than before . " Jacques Fayol was in Grasse when the first Resistance cell was formed . Being a good Frenchman and presumably  --  since he was Parisian and rich  --  with some knowledge of the world , he was invited to join us . He seemed quite pleased , flattered even , to be part of it . We were amateurs then , in forty-two , not at all what we would later become , and I am afraid those first clandestine meetings were abysmally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare war because they had not been allotted sufficient candy . Alors , the thing began . It was agreed that Fayol , for his part , would do nothing operational in Grasse . He was to come and go as before , but he was to be our link to more seasoned , more experienced , more professional people in Paris and the north . Since he possessed a railroad pass , we would use Fayol as liaison . Here , in Grasse , we simple countrymen would do the stabbing and the shooting and the bombing . " Winslow could imagine Masson in the pulpit , spinning out parables . Marianna hung on his words . But it was Anouk who surprised Winslow . She listened , she asked pertinent questions , she communicated quiet dignity . She was a long way from the man-crazy , pill-popping child-woman of the past two nights . Then Winslow remembered the cocaine he 'd brought from her apartment . What a rotten thing to do ! He resolved to flush it down the toilet back at the hotel . Masson went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We made mistakes . Guns misfired , ambushes were set up on the wrong street corner , we  | misused code , we pestered the English with meaningless information we thought perfectly splendid and they knew to be useless . " He paused for a moment and smiled . " I remember once arguing vociferously that we absolutely must send a courier to London with the bus schedule between Grasse and Cannes written in invisible ink on a matchbook . Well " ? he smiled ? " we were young . " " Even from the first , Jacques Fayol was better than most of us at the game . He was a more sophisticated man , more worldly in the good sense . He seemed to know instinctively what was vital , what was marginal . When a man 's life should be risked , when prudence was the right course . Small beginnings , of course , until the Resistance in the north gained confidence in our loyalty , in our resolve , and in our ability . By mid-1943 we were pretty good at what we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . Information got out , men came in , the occasional German was killed , the odd Vichyite roughed up . It was in the intelligence aspect that Fayol shone . " His couture house was functioning full out in Paris . Despite the shortage of fabric , of buttons , of needle and thread , the couture prospered throughout the war . The Germans , of course , were excellent customers , buying fine clothes for their wives at home , for their girl friends here . French women of means had little to do with their money . They could n't travel , they could n't buy new cars , they could not play the Bourse . So ... they bought clothes . Anything to brighten that drab time of Occupation . Important people , Germans , Vichyites , the rich and powerful , dropped by Fayol 's establishment and the other couture houses , and , as people will do , they gossiped . Fayol ensured that most of that gossip found its way to the appropriate ear . He had valid reason to travel , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various retail stores around the country . He used his rail pass frequently . And he used it well . " Then , " said Canon Masson with the properly dramatic flair , " then he made his mistake . " He gestured for the glasses and he refilled them all , including his own . Anouk shook her head .  | " I did n't really want any more , thank you , " she said . Winslow thought she looked especially alert . He realized this was the first account she 'd ever really had of just what her father had done in the war , just what his shame had been , and what his excuse . She leaned toward the priest and her suntanned hands clenched pale . " Poor Jacques , " Masson said , with what seemed real feeling , real affection . " Like all of us , he had his weaknesses . Larger than life as he was , even in those days his flaws were magnified . There was an important piece of intelligence that arrived by boat down the beach from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was left to Fayol to carry it to Paris . Well " ? and he raised his hands helplessly ? " what can one say ? There was a woman , Fayol dined too well , in bed they talked , and . . . " He stopped for a moment , looking at Anouk . " I am sorry , mademoiselle . Six members of the Resistance here in the south and several in Paris , no one ever really knew how many , were brought in . One of them survived his conversations with the Gestapo and implicated your father . " " The others ? " Anouk asked in a low voice . " Oh , dead , of course . By various means . " Anouk shook her head . " They did n't think he , my father , did it on purpose ? " Masson nodded heavily . " Well , there were those who did . I did n't . I knew the man . Some others here in Grasse  --  farmers , commerciants , jealous perhaps of a Parisian , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a traitor ! He is venal , he sold out ! He is a coward , he became frightened and talked ! ' I argued , but who would listen to me ? There was no seal of confession , of course : Fayol never Communicated . But I knew his little lapses , I knew his tongue became loose , I knew the woman involved , I knew how . . . susceptible he was . " " What happened ? " Winslow asked . " What usually happened in those days . Drumhead justice . A star-chamber proceeding . Fayol was sentenced in absentia . I voted to acquit , of course , so did one or two others . But the majority ruled and a request was sent up to Paris to the Resis-  | tance there to arrest him and send him back to Grasse . Or , if that was inconvenient , to execute sentence right there . " " Without even a chance to defend himself ? " Marianna demanded . " Mademoiselle , " Masson said gently , " our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of war , thousands of others had been arrested , tortured , shot . They were hard times . What was the life of one Frenchman more or less ? Especially a Frenchmen his peers considered had betrayed them . But , as I say , Fayol was intelligent . He knew , of course ; must have known from the first . He hid out , without ever going to the Germans , mind you , for three months . And when things had quieted down he suddenly appeared again , right here in Grasse , and gave himself up . Quel geste ! It was magnificent . He dazzled these local peasants at the hearing . Ridiculed their suspicions , admitted he 'd been a fool , that the girl had played with him , and demanded which of them had never made a mistake . It was in this very building , in the cellar , where the Resistance leadership customarily met . I can see Fayol now . " Canon Masson pushed back his chair and stood up . He weaved slightly . My god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadied . He was Fayol now , Fayol in 1943 with his life dan-gling : " Which of you has never had a glass too many ? Which has never spoken when he should have remained mute ? ' Which .. . which of you has never . . . never , I say . . . never made a damnfool of himself over a beautiful woman ? " Masson looked at his guests , his eyes , reddened now , engaging theirs and then sliding away . He breathed deeply , sat down heavily , and for a minute or two said nothing . To Winslow he looked emotionally spent . Anouk , looking very much her age now , face shining , eyes wide , broke the mood . " But , Monseigneur , what happened ? " Masson roused himself . " Alors , of course they voted to give him another chance . He  | himself offered to dispatch the woman involved . And from then until the end of the war he performed prodigies . It was only afterward , with the hysteria of the liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had once again to stand before a tribunal . That was in Paris , where they knew Fayol only as a successful businessman during the Occupation . And not as we knew him , the best courier in the business . " Marianna looked at Winslow . Her face was serious , her brow knit . " But the woman ? You said he dispatched ' her ? Did you mean that he killed her ? " Masson nodded . " It was that more than anything , I believe , that turned him to young men . " He stopped abruptly and turned to Anouk . " You will please pardon me , Mademoiselle Fayol , for mentioning this in front of you . " Anouk smiled . It was late . The old priest had obviously tired himself . Winslow decided now was the time . " Canon Masson , there was this message from Monsieur Fayol to his daughter . Transmitted by the huissier , Grumbach . The message referred to your providing spiritual guidance if ever she needed it . " " Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask a priest about spiritual guidance for a third party ? He determined to press on , regardless of the protocol . " Spiritual guidance would be , bien stir , a private matter . But I have the suspicion , and Mademoiselle Fayol agrees with it , that her father was saying something else . That he was not a man who spoke in spiritual terms and that Grumbach 's message meant something entirely different . Different , but important . " " Yes , " Anouk put in quickly , " it would be hypocritical of my father to suggest . . . " Winslow cut her off . He did n't want this to become a theological debate . " As you may not know , Canon , the huissier Grumbach is dead . Killed by a truck just a day or two after having sent his message . "  | Masson 's eyes were glazed . " Ah , " he said , " there were many good men killed . In the war . I remember . . . " " Father ? " Marianna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with you for his daughter ? Some paper ? " Winslow thought , bless you , my love , bless you . Masson seemed to pull himself together . " For his daughter ? Oh , yes , yes . Some papers . " Winslow flashed a signal to Anouk with his eyes . " Monseigneur , " she said quietly , " may I please have that which my father left here with you for me ? " Masson considered for a moment . Then , slowly , heavily , he stood . He looked at this beautiful young girl sitting at his table , the only child of his old wartime comrade and lifetime antithesis , and he made a courtly little bow . " But of course , Mademoiselle Fayol , " he said . Winslow exhaled slowly and drained the pony of its brandy . Masson stood up . " These papers . He used his code name from the war to label them . " " Paris One ? " Winslow asked . Masson looked blank . " But how did you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , he smiled . " Jacques was our man in Paris . He was Paris One . ' We were , you see , a modest organization . There was no Paris Two . ' " He left the room .  | It was three o'clock in the morning . Anthony Winslow sat in his shorts in his room at the Muraour . His eyes were tired , his back ached . The fake period escritoire was covered with papers , many of them written by hand . Tossed on the bed , opened and empty , was a dusty brick-red manila folder , the same sort of file folder the dead huissier , Grumbach , had passed to him with trembling hands the first , and only , time they met . But this folder was different . Affixed to the top left was a simple gummed sticker on which were written two words in what Winslow took to be Grumbach 's own spidery hand : " Paris One . " Winslow reached for a cigar butt resting soggily in an ashtray . He relighted the butt and stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but if it was what it seemed to be , the nagging mystery of why Delaware Corp . valued the House of Fayol at a hundred million was no longer a mystery : Jacques Fayol had quietly , legally , and effectively made a corner of the world production of attar . Fayol literally owned the flowers of Grasse ! The thing was incredible . Oh , there 'd been corners made before in the strategic commodities . Tungsten , vanadium , certain grades of industrial diamond , upland coffee , that sort of thing . The wood-paneled world of merchant banking was replete with  | instances . But always the coup had been pulled off by giant corporations , by consortiums , by shrewd , reckless brigands who gambled millions , leveraged their assets , and ruthlessly destroyed competitors . The international bully boys backed by Wall Street , by the gnomes of Zurich , by the oil sheikhs , by the CIA  --  those were the fellows for a sweep like this . But it had n't been they who 'd pulled it off . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , and a country priest for confidant , who 'd done it . Winslow shook his head in admiration . He wished Henry Rousselot were here to savor the moment . Then , after a moment , he wished even more that he could have known the man who accomplished it . Canon Masson had left them at table and had gone off , rolling slightly as if on the deck of a small boat . The file was wrapped in oilskin and had been concealed in some hidey-hole in the depths of the old stone rectory . He returned blowing away the dust . With another little bow , he handed it to Anouk . She held the think for a moment and then passed it on to Winslow . " Monsieur Winslow est mon banquier , " she explained . There was no flirtation about it , just a dignified statement , and not even Marianna could take offense . Winslow smiled at the girl and unwrapped the file . There was a letter , from Fayol . " It 's addressed to you , " Winslow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winslow turned toward the light . " My dearest child , " it read . " My instructions are that you shall read this only if I die . Grumbach is a good fellow and Canon Masson is my friend . Trust them . I am sorry I have not given you more reason to trust me , but I shall not bore you with regrets or apologies . " As any competent lawyer will be able to tell you , these papers represent valid claim to ownership of a great many of the farms of Grasse . They are in various forms : outright deeds of sale , deeds of transmittal in lieu of loan repayment , collateral , even one or two gifts to me , for reasons even I find difficult to analyze . " At the time of this writing I estimate this file conveys owner-  | ship of pernaps seventy to eighty percent of the attar-producing land of the region . I will attempt , before I die , and obviously before you read this , to augment these holdings . " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how I came by it . It is not my intention to sell at present , alI though I have initiated preliminary talks with one of the big American multinational concerns and with someone acting for the Shah . I have begun these talks out of curiosity , to determine just how much greedy men might pay for Grasse . And , oh yes , for another reason . Because the playing of intricate games has always amused me . " This file of papers now belongs to you . Grumbach notarized each in its time . You now own what I amassed . . . the essential oil fields of Grasse . Do with them what your head , and your heart , tell you is right . " The flowers , dearest Anne , belong to you . " With all my love . " Winslow looked up . " It 's signed , Papa . ' " The girl was smiling . Winslow was surprised . He had found the last words of Fayol touching , moving . He felt a momentary anger at Anouk . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about ? Anouk looked around the room , at Winslow , at Marianna , at the old priest . " He did love me , you see . He really did . Whatever my mother said . " Winslow felt ashamed . The girl 's happiness was this last message from a father she 'd thought she 'd lost . He reached out and took her hand . Masson had poured a final brandy . " It was guilt , of course , guilt and expiation , " he said in answer to Winslow 's question " Fayol felt he had a debt to Grasse to the farmers of the region because of his folly during the war that had killed those six men . He lived with guilt and searched for some way to expiate . And there was guilt on the other side too , chez les  | fermiers . They 'd judged the man , sentenced him to death , and now they were sorry . So , after the war , when times were hard , the farmers went to Fayol for loans . He helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in essential oils . In return , they signed over their land to him , deeded their farms , made him the repository of their hopes for Grasse , for the trade , for the future . You see , " Canon Masson said , " they were being naive , in the best sense . They were demonstrating to Fayol that they trusted him with what they held most precious , their land . They had mistrusted him once , and he had proved himself a better man than most of them , and now they wanted to pay off their guilt . " I think , " he said , " Fayol would have held this paper forever . I do not think he would ever have called in his notes . " Then , hurriedly , as if he 'd committed a gaffe , he turned to Anouk . " I do not mean to predispose you , mademoiselle . The deeds , the leases , the farms , they are for you to do with as you wish . I am only stating an opinion that obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and kissed him on the cheek . Now Winslow sat in his hotel room , drained , exhausted , pleased to have put an end to riddles . He wondered what the sleeping farmers would think if they realized some smart young merchant banker from Wall Street was sitting among them , literally holding their futures in his hands . Well , he thought , Rousselot always said bankers could n't play God . Winslow inhaled . And that , he supposed , meant Delaware Corp . would end up running Grasse . He stood up . " To hell with it , " he said aloud . He needed sleep . Masson was taking them in the morning to meet with one or two of the farmers involved , just to authenticate signatures . It was a formality . But at Rousselot you observed the formalities . He fell into bed and was quickly asleep . He had forgotten to jettison the cocaine . Emile and Jean-Pierre had seen Winslow and the girls return from the rectory . They had seen the bulky parcel under Win-  | slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long call , and their instructions were quite precise . They rendezvoused at Canon Masson 's rectory at noon . He was jocular , expansive . " My housekeeper was wrong , " he said . " She told me the country wine will kill me . Not at all . It will be the local brandy . " He had telephoned to one of the farmers to warn of their coming . Winslow and the girls had checked out of the hotel . After seeing this farmer , Gaspar , and perhaps one or two others , they would head north . Driving fast and taking turns at the wheel , they would be in Paris soon after midnight . It was a hot day and Winslow put down the top of the car . Anouk asked him to drive . " I 'm still so happy about my father I shall never be able to concentrate on the road , " she said . Gaspar was a huge red-faced peasant in overalls . " Ah , well , " he said , " of course I signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who gave him the black spot that night in the cellar . You owe a man something after a foul business like that . " He had them seat themselves in the main room of the house . " My wife is dead , my son spends all his time listening to discs and chasing girls , and I 'm alone . Still , " he said , " I 'll hate handing over this place to anyone else . It 's been in my family since , what ? oh , since about the time Napoleon went into Italy over the Petit Saint-Bernard pass up there in the mountains . " Then , realizing the girl was there , he turned to Anouk and apologized . " Naturally , mademoiselle , the deed is valid . I do n't mean to suggest it is n't . Just an old fellow 's meandering over a wasted life . " " Not wasted , not wasted at all , " Masson insisted . " Gaspar , it is sinful to denigrate yourself that way . I wo n't hear more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats and a chilled white wine . He and Winslow and Masson smoked Winslow 's Havanas while  | Marianna and Anouk went outside into the sun in front of the farmhouse . " You should stay the night , you know , " Gaspar told the American . " That 's the time . The workers going out at two , three o'clock in the morning , their gunnysacks ready to be filled with petals . Ah , that 's the time . Then , at sunrise , into the town in the wagons , and after you weigh out at the merchants ' ? the first glass of the day , a fresh brioche , and some cafe au fait and a smoke . " Winslow went to stand in the open doorway . He could see Anouk and Marianna walking waist-deep in the fields , the flowers all around them . Even through the cigar smoke he could smell the blossoms . " What are they , Gaspar ? " he asked . " Oh , those are the roses of May , " he said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungent mosses , the lilac . . . ah , you can barely breathe in the fields without becoming drunk on it . I tell you , monsieur , stay awhile , stay and smell the bags tomorrow . We 'll have a splendid time and drink some wine and smoke more of these wonderful cigars of yours . " " Gaspar , " Masson said sternly , " au fond you are a sensualist . " The farmer laughed . " At bottom and everywhere else , Monseigneur . " Winslow looked across the field , shimmering in the heat of early afternoon , the roses barely moving in the still air . So peaceful , so calm , so unspoiled . Tomorrow he would be in Paris , next week in New York ; and this field , these roses , this jovial old farmer , would be here , under the Mediterranean sun . That is , if the Delaware Corp . so dictated . He had a sudden , irrational dislike for his clients . Not very bankerlike , he thought , frowning at himself . Marianna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Winslow saw them slow , stop , and turn . He raised an arm to wave , not sure whether they could see him in the doorway . A bee hovered in the warm air just before his face . " Pollinate , dammit , pollinate , " Winslow told the bee . The bee , unimpressed , buzzed again , and then drifted off on the light breath of the wind .  | Behind him Winslow could hear the old priest and the old farmer , both of them large men , expansive , loud  --  in the old world sense , " men with big bellies . " He liked the sound of their talk , their laughter . He was n't part of it , could not be , but that was not to say he could not hear it with pleasure . The thing that was not pleasant was this sense of inevitability about the land stretching off beyond him , land under flowers , land that had not changed all that much since , in Gaspar 's wonderful words , Napoleon had passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to be Delaware Corp . He gave a brief , silent laugh . At least that bastard up in Paris in his neo-Mussolini office would be screwed . Screwed too , the Iranian , Nafredi . Well , if bastards had to win , maybe it was well that they were " our bastards . " He wondered who had said that . But , shit , it was hard to see a man like this Gaspar sign over . If only Anouk would decide not to exercise her prerogatives , leave the land to the farmers , put the fucking " Paris One " file in a safety deposit box and tell him and the bank and the Delaware Corp . that she was saying " no " to eighty-five million . Would he ? Winslow asked himself . And could not answer . The sun weighed down . The flowers stretched red and pink and yellow to the horizon , first Gaspar 's fields and then another and then another , until the land began to roll upward and then became fuzzy in the haze and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to float above the flowers . Then the bee returned , buzzing , buzzing louder , and Winslow 's hand moved instinctively to shoo it away again but behind the buzzing there was the wind and then he realized it was not a bee but something larger . The flowers rippled and swayed rhythmically first , then erratically , then chaotically , like the angry chop of a riptide in a technicolored sea . Then Winslow saw the helicopter . The pilot , like Jean-Pierre , was a technician . The man riding shotgun , like smile , was a Corsican . He fondled the machine gun the way tmile cared for his knives , with care , with delicacy , with passion even . The copter had refueled at Nice and it came in low  | over the coastal hills and picked up Jean-Pierre 's and Emile 's car at the appropriate map coordinates . They exchanged waves , and both car and copter set off for their rendezvous at Gaspar 's farm . It was the Corsican who saw the girls . He poked the pilot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sort of thing , understood . He dropped the nose of the ship and roared in low over the farmhouse . He did not see Winslow but he saw the two girls . Seeing the yellow ship approach , Anouk tentatively raised a hand , as if to wave ; but Marianna , without knowing precisely why , recognized danger . She grabbed Anouk 's arm roughly and the two of them began to run , awkwardly in the high flowers , toward Gaspar 's house . The little yellow craft got there first . The helicopter hovered a few feet off the ground and then , nearly obscured by swirling dust and thousands of petals torn from the rose bushes , it settled to earth . The glass hatch swung open , and even before the rotor had stopped turning , the Corsican hit the ground , knees bent , the machine gun held low , pointing toward the farmhouse . As the rotor slowed and stopped , the flower petals drifted softly to earth , a colorful , silent snow . Marianna and Anouk had stopped running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stood there , tensed , waiting . They did not realize it , but they were holding hands . " Merde ! " shouted Gaspar as he burst past Winslow into the front yard of the farmhouse . Winslow was looking at the girls , frozen , unsure . Gaspar was looking at his flowers . " The fucking bastards , " he cried . " My goddamn flowers . " He shook his head in rage and raised two great fists to the sky as if to call down god . Then , he wheeled and ran heavily back to the house . Winslow had started toward the copter . The pilot had climbed out now . He was not showing a weapon but Winslow could see all too clearly the automatic weapon aimed in his general direction by the other man . Winslow kept walking , his hands slightly extended , open , to show he carried nothing . He had no idea what would happen when he reached the two men . Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a car bouncing along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shout behind him .  | " Out of the way , mon vieux ! " It was Gaspar , raising an ancient shotgun to his shoulder . Canon Masson was in the yard now too , still smoking his Hastill holding a glass . He looked bemused . Winslow slid off to the left , trying to move smoothly so as not to draw a shot , but wanting to clear Gaspar 's field of fire . Fifty yards away the machine gunner sank to one knee and casually raised the gun . " Destroy my flowers ... " Gaspar was muttering , when his face disappeared and then Winslow heard the rrrippp of a burp gun and Gaspar fell . " Oh , " Canon Masson said . He put down his wineglass carefully upright in the dust and knelt over Gaspar to bless him . The gunner stood and began to walk toward the farmhouse . The pilot drifted behind him , watching the girls . The car was there now . It was a Citroen DS . Two men were getting out . Winslow had seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom window . Well , he thought , here we go . Then there was movement behind him and Masson said , " S'il vous plait ? " Winslow turned and watched as the old priest raised Gaspar 's shotgun to his shoulder and fired . The shot rocketed past Winslow , momentarily deafening him , and he flinched . When the smoke had cleared he saw that the pilot had fallen but the other man , the one with the automatic gun , was coming on at a trot . Masson fired again . This time there was only a dull click . The men from the car had reached them . One of them  --  it was Jean-Pierre  --  - took the shotgun almost gently from Masson 's hands . The other , Emile , patted Winslow 's body . Then he turned and waved an arm to the girls . " Alors , venez ici , hein ? " Winslow , helpless , defeated , nodded , and slowly , almost wearily , Anouk and Marianna walked toward the little group of men standing in the yard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot . No one said anything , and the gunmen simply gestured toward the house and they all went inside . Masson spoke first .  | " It is difficult to imagine why a man would load only one barrel of a gun . " He sounded disappointed in Gaspar . It was cool in the house . Gaspar 's cigar was still burning in the ashtray . The dishes with scraps of cold meat and cheese , the half baguette of bread , the wine bottles , Gaspar 's napkin , were there on his table . And his body lay in the sun just outside the door . " Close that , " one of the gunmen said , and the one with the machine gun kicked the door shut . Winslow 's eyes , used to the bright sunshine , moved around the dim room . " Alors , " said the one who seemed to be the leader , Jean-Pierre , " now we commence . " Winslow decided it was time to break the spell . He had n't said a word since the helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a killing on your hands already , " he told JeanPierre , " but since the farmer also had a gun , you may be able to get off . I suggest you leave all of us alone here before this goes so far you ca n't ... " " Shut your mouth , " the machine gunner said flatly . Marianna and Anouk were quiet . Thank god for that , Winslow thought . If they were hysterical .. . " It was n't like Gaspar , you know , " Canon Masson said . " What ? " Winslow asked , concentrating not on what Masson was saying but on their predicament . " A man of his experience with guns . One shell in a two-barreled shotgun . Unheard of . " " Monseigneur , " Jean-Pierre advised , " please be still . " He turned to the machine gunner . " Give me that thing and go out and bring in your pilot . Then the farmer . I do n't like leaving bodies in the open like that . " Emile laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell like sausages , tu sais . " The machine gunner did as he was ordered . " Now , " JeanPierre said , " their luggage . Bring everything in. " smile nodded and went out . Jean-Pierre , his eyes on Winslow as the potential
