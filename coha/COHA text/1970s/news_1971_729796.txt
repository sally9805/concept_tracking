txt If you want to buy a pair of blue jeans , a car , a U.S. flag or a tuna sandwich , you had better hurry . If the price has n't gone up already , it probably will soon . On the other hand , if your need is for a hearing aid , a couple of pieces of fried chicken , a new razor , a carload of aluminum ingots or a Hong Kong custom-tailored suit , take your time and shop around . Chances are the prices wo n't change for a while . That , at least , is the word from some of the businessmen who make and sell those products . They are among executives in scores of industries who were interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters in an attempt to learn what price trends can be expected now that the first phase of President Nixon 's new policy is over and Phase 2 is in effect . The answer turns out to be that no overall trend is yet evident . Some companies are raising prices , some are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 rules that they just do n't know what they will do . As Big as Possible Even within specific industries , clearcut trends are gernPfirn .. 5 hard to discern . For instance , Latrobe Steel Co. , a Pennsylvaniabased producer of stainless and other specialty steels , says it plans to raise prices as quickly and as much as it can . The only question is what the government will allow ; Marshall Schober , president , says company officials at the moment are " totally confused " over the guidelines laid down by the Price Co But a competing specialty steelmaker , Washington Steel Co. , says the Price Commission 's guidelines are irrelevant at the rrinTr ? PT " . " The real question is whether or not the marketplace gives you the option to exercise the right " to raise prices , says George P. Baumunk , president of Washington Steel . " We could n't raise prices in a market as weak as this one . " Indeed , specialty steelmakers tried several times late last year and early this year to raise prices  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the demand for their products just was n't strong enough . Stainless steel prices , a particular target of price cutting earlier this year , eventually were raised successfully- , but only ? after- some of the major steelmakers , like U.S. Steel Corp. , went along . For companies in some other industries , the problem is not so much market no.ralitinna but outright confusion over just what the government will or wo n't allow . " We fall in the same category as 99% of the nation  --  totally confused as to what the hell is allowed , " says Jim Christensen , vice president of Amalgamated Sugar Co. of Ogden , Utah . Waiting for an Answer In Amalgamated 's case , the problem is compounded because it signed a contract with its employes Oct. 5 calling for a 10% wage boost retroactive to Aug. 1 . But now the company is n't sure whether so large a wage boost will be allowed or whether it can be retroactive . Consequently , it does n't know how much it needs to raise prices to cover higher wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote a letter to the Pay Board stating our contract terms and saying we 'd like to put them into effect , but so far we 've heard nothing , " Mr. Christensen says . When Henry H. Sayles , assistant secretary of Corning Glass Works and the man in charge of the company 's Phase 2 planning , was asked whether Corning Glass would raise prices , he began reading aloud to a reporter from the Price Commission 's guidelines . Then he stopped and asked : " What the hell does it mean ? " But Jean Roberts , owner of Roberts Delicatessen &; Restaurant in downtown Philadelphia , suffers from no such confusion . She says she 's raising a number of prices on her menu effective today . Some will be well over the general 2.5% restraint set down by the Price Commission , but others wo n't change at all . On balance , Mrs. Roberts says , the increases will average less than 2.5% . Try the Chopped Liver One item that 's going up is a tuna sandwich ; it 's now 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that due to wholesale increases in food prices , dishes containing fish , lettuce , cheese and beef all will be increased . " Chopped liver wo n't change , " she says . Across the country in San Francisco , the elegant Blue Fox Restaurant will raise prices " in the near future " on " whatever is imported from Europe , " says Mario Mondin , manager . That would include caviar , foie gras and wines . " Why , " says Mr. Mondin , " cognac is going up $6 a case . " Imported supplies , of course , now cost the re.tairrnnt more because many are subject to the new import surcharge . Mr. Mondin says he does n't plan to increase prices on locally produced foods . ( Some other San Francisco restaurateurs , however , wo n't be raising prices , much as they might like to . " Raise prices ? We have n't any business to speak of , " says Tom DiMaggio , coowner of DiMaggio 's Restaurant on the city 's Fisherman 's Wharf . " How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . I got to take it on the chin if I want anyone to coma into my door . " Many San Francisco restaurant owners have been moaning about slow business lately , and Mr. DiMaggio says publicity about mercury poisoning in fish has been particularly harmful to seafood restaurants like DiMaggio 's . ) From a total dollar-volume point of view , the most comprehensive round of price increases likely soon will be in the auto industry . Though the exact amounts are n't yet known , it 's expected that auto makers will levy one and possibly two sets of price increases within the next 45 days . The first increase would be an attempt to reinstate as much as possible of the 4% to 5% increases  --  amounting to $175 to $200 on an average car ? that were scheduled for this fall but were blocked by the wage-price freeze . Nobody as yet is sure what the new increases may amount to because , under the Price Commission guidelines , they will have to be justified by a complex formula taking into account new cost increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies have annual sales of over $100 million , it is expected that any price increase will have to be approved in advance , despite an ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - ? - ? ? .. t to the contrary over the weekend . ( For details , see story on page 3 . ) The second increase , if it comes , would be a relatively small one to cover the cost of new seat-belt warning systems that will be required in all new cars sold after Jan. 1 . The net effect on the car-buyer 's pocketbook may be hard to figure out , however , because of other factors involved in car pricing . If Congress agrees , as expected , to remove the 7% excise tax on autos , the price of an average car would drop about $200 . Thus any increase would be at least partially offset . The prices of some types of clothing will be going up , too . Cone Mills Corp. , a major textiles and apparel producer in Greensboro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases , " says C. Edward Connolly , vice president and treasurer . He says cost increases such as higher cotton prices make the price rises One textile-industry source says c ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? can expect higher prices on such big-selling items as blue jeans and other casual wear that use cotton denim , corduroy and flannel . Cone is a major producer of all these materials . Even the price of Old Glory will be going up soon . W. Frederic Shedinger , president of Dettra Flag Co. of Oaks , Pa. , says his company has already laid out a new flag catalog with an average price increase of about 5% . Today he plans to push the button on the press to run the catalog off . The cost of parking also will go up in some cities . Allright Auto Parks Inc. says fees in 25 of its garages in Los Angeles , Baltimore and some other places will go up from about $1 to about $1.25 . But they wo n't be raised for a week or so . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spokesman Jor the Houston-based concern . He hastens to add that the garages involved are only a fraction of the company 's 1,000 lots ; those involved just happened to get caught with lower summer rates in effect , he says . Those companies that do n't plan to try to raise prices in the near future offer a mixed bag of explPn ? ? tinr ? q A sizable number say , like San Francisco restaurateur DiMaggio , that ' business is so bad they could n't get away with higher prices . " Business is so slow , how can I raise the price ? " asks Henry Kwok of Henry 's Hong Kong Custom Tailored Clothes in San Francisco . " Especially this kind of business . A man can always wear a suit for another year . " Don Herlihy , operations vice president for Church 's Fried Chicken in San Antonio , says the company plans to continue offering two large pieces of fried chicken and a fresh roll for an average price of 54 cents in order to maintain its competitive position . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about Phase 2 before acting . A Gillette spokesman says that for this reason his company has n't any plans to change prices in the near future . Some businessmen say they are just downright reluctant to raise prices even if they could . Bruce Elder , president of two small casket-making firms in Detroit , says he may have to raise prices eventually but " not immediately . " And Anthony DeLorenzo , president of Anthony 's Hearing Aid Center Inc. , says : " As far as I 'm d , ( hearing aid prices ) are high enough now . " He says he has n't raised prices in the last year and a half .
