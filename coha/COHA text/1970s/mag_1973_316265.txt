For years the Soviets have raided Western publishing houses and simply taken whatever they wanted . In 1972 alone they published 8,100,000 copies of books by Americans without gaining their authors ' consent and without paying royalties . Western governments , publishers and authors have long pleaded with Moscow to change its ways . Last week the U.S.S.R. suddenly announced that it accepts the Universal Copyright Convention . Although royalty payments will not be retroactive , the Soviets are now committed to enter into financial contracts with foreign publishers , just like the 62 other adherents ( including the U.S. ) to the UNESCO-sponsored convention . <P> Since the U.S.S.R. translates far more foreign books , mainly scientific , than the West gets from Russia , the Soviets stand to lose millions of dollars in hard currencies . Like the agreement to pay some old Lend-Lease bills , however , it is part of a general normalization of East-West relations . Beyond that , the copyright decision has political consequences as well . In Moscow last week a Communist Party official said bluntly that " the copyright law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . " As an example , she cited Alexander Solzhenitsyn , whose last three banned novels have been bestsellers in the West . <P> Until now , some dissident writers have been able to avoid trouble by claiming that their books appeared abroad without their consent . They " risked imprisonment only if it could be proved that their work contained " slanderous inventions defamatory to the Soviet state . " In the future , any publication within the copyright area would need the writer 's approval . The Soviets could then claim that any foreign publication of a dissident work violates the state monopoly on foreign trade-a crime punishable by up to ten years in prison and confiscation of property . <P> Soviet adherence to the copyright convention will also establish official control over Western publication of works that appear in Russia . Such works were previously in the public domain , and Western houses felt free to print what they chose . Says U.S. Copyright Lawyer Alan U. Schwartz : " The Soviets may now presume to play on the commercial greed of our publishers by offering special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets from using their copyright to suppress some of the finest works of Russian literature .
