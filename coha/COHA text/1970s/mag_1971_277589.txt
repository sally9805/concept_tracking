" In short , we find ourselves guilty , " the Washington Post told readers of its editorial page . In convicting itself of " reinforcing a misconception , " the Post was straightforward about it : " There is no adequate excuse for making this kind of error in the first place and none for failing to pursue the truth behind the phony ' facts . ' " <P> The Post 's sin was to state on Dec. 9 , 1969 that " a total of 28 Black Panther members have died in clashes with police since Jan. 1 , 1968 " without giving the source of its information or trying to verify the accuracy of the figure . What prompted the Post apology was an investigative report by Edward Jay Epstein , published last month in The New Yorker . In six months of research , Epstein found that only ten Panther deaths were due to police action , and in at least eight of those cases the police had been provoked in varying degrees before opening fire . <P> Tracking Truth . The original claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garry , chief counsel for the Black Panther Party . Most newspapers that reported Garry 's statement mentioned the lawyer in their original stories . But some-including the Post and the New York Times-carelessly dropped Garry 's name in subsequent stories . With or without mention of the source , the constant use of the figure tended to fix it as factual in the public mind . When finally confronted by Epstein last fall , Garry readily modified the charge from 28 Panther deaths to 19 . Later , he classified any figure as " irrelevant . " <P> Epstein , a 35-year-old political-science instructor at Harvard , was assigned to track down the truth of the police-Panther issue by New Yorker Editor William Shawn . He not only deflated the Garry figure but also took the press as a whole to task for failing to carefully check claims that enthusiastic partisans such as Garry make for their cause . <P> Among Epstein 's targets were both TIME and Newsweek . While neither accepted Garry 's claim as fact , both used it as a reason for speculating on the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dec. 19 , 1969 ) asked : " Are the raids against Panther offices part of a national design to destroy the Panther leadership ? " In the same week , Newsweek posed a similar question : " Is there some sort of government conspiracy afoot to exterminate the Black Panthers ? " LIFE gets some backhanded credit for saying in its Feb. 6 , 1970 , issue : " The Panthers claim 28 dead , but it is uncertain that more than a dozen have died of police bullets . " <P> Shouldering Blame . The Epstein article stirred some self-examination that served to remind newsmen that they can never be too careful . In taking itself to task , the Post filed only a mild demurrer " concerning Mr. Epstein 's presentation of his case and his manner of quoting . " The Times dutifully mentioned Epstein 's indictment , but in a story that was buried deep in a bulging Sunday edition . The Washington Star , which was not even among those accused by Epstein , ran an editorial that noted its own care not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its mea culpa , but nonetheless shouldered part of the blame directed at the press in general .
