// It 's a forbidding land , of austere desert and scorching heat . A forbidden land  --  when one thinks of Mecca , the center of the Muslim world . Saudi Arabia occupies four-fifths of the Arabian peninsula and governs half the population of that region . Founded in the 1920 's by the purist Islamic Wahabis , to whom the ruling Saud family must still lend a furtive ear , this kingdom has brought unity to the area for the first time since Muhammad , in the seventh century . In the Mideast war of 1967 , its allies , Egypt and Syria , bore the brunt of the military operations and the ensuing political wrangling . The aftermath of the Yom Kippur war was different . Once the Arab world decided on oil well diplomacy , to impose the fear of an energy shortage  --  or an energy catastrophe  --  on the rest of the world , it was clear that Saudi Arabia would become the leading political force . Everything changes , nothing changes . The arc lamps of international concern beam down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways of life of the majority of the citizens remain as they have for centuries . The Arabian desert conjures up the delights of swirling chiffon , skilled amours and Copenhagen love . But its true face is tough , so different : the sand dune , not the divan . The life is puritan , stark , not luxurious ; just  --  to the letter of the Koran  --  not corrupt ; practical , not seething with feuds . The desert is harsh , inimical to anyone who has not learned to adapt ; yet a point of return even for the city Arab . Quentin Crewe , perhaps more than most authors , has captured this soul of Arabia , this spirit of the desert . He writes : " The desert is a basic part of life for all Arabians . Every Friday ( the Muslim Sunday ) the inhabitants of Riyadh set out from the city in cars to picnic there . " At first sight the desert is a sad disappointment to Europeans , whose eyes are trained to landscapes busy with incident and splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape by the high sun , they see nothing . All looks like a gigantic vacant lot , scrubby and dirty , lifeless and abandoned  --  miles and miles of drab sameness . " A few days later you can not imagine ever having this feeling . The desert becomes a place of infinite change and subtlety , alive and powerful . What seemed repetitive is now exciting in its delicate permutations . in moving across it , you get to know those places that can be safely driven over , and the patches of rippled sand that will snatch at the wheels of the car and bog them down . This means an hour 's digging and pushing . " Nowhere in the world does the time of day make so great a difference to the landscape . In early morning the sands are red and vibrant , instantly awake as soon as the sun gives shape to the dunes . The great crescents and , domes look highest in the morning . The air is cold , crisping the knife-edge of the dune crests , and colors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock it is hot and the sun takes everything out of the desert . There are no shapes , no shadows  --  only the shimmering streaks of the mirages . The sun grips the desert until about foul o'clock , when the white glare slants away from your eyes , revealing an almost glacial landscape . The shapes of the dunes return , somehow more rounded , perhaps blurred by the heat . Strangely , while the sands glowed in the cold morning light , now , in the hot evening , they look cold , reflecting the light . " Then it is dark , suddenly and conclusively , and the desert ceases to exist . There are only the stars-more vivid and real than you have ever seen them . This is a far cry from the seemingly drab waste of the first few days . But perhaps more important than the new meaning of the vast spaces is the recognition of the abundance of interest that lies within a hand 's reach . The sand about you becomes a newspaper to be read and a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who or what has passed that way-men and their camels , gazelles , scorpions , lizards , chameleons . In a short time one learns to concentrate on the smallest details . Having first had to absorb spaces greater than ever before , the eye then has to see the land more minutely than was ever necessary . " The people who live in this desert are as hard and spare as the land they inhabit , for to survive demands unrelenting attention and a rigid code of behavior . To refuse a traveler is perhaps to kill him . To be refused may be a sentence of death . In this simple fact lies the basis of Arab hospitality . Every attitude is geared to survival . Various codes must not be open to question . A traveling companion must be totally reliable . If a Bedu is traveling with a stranger and they are attacked by the Bedu 's family , he will kill his father and brother to protect his companion . No doubt is admissible . " Once we had seen the way in which the nomads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desert life . We were some six hundred miles from even the smallest village when we first met the true nomads . " We sat at a well . Suddenly , the men all vanished . They always saw things at least half a minute before we did . What they had seen was a Bedouin 's head beginning to appear over the saucer rim of the depression in which the well lay . Before you could see the camel on which he was riding , our men had found their rifles , loaded them . and concealed themselves behind the trucks . " For several minutes we waited . Then , one of our guides suddenly leapt out and advanced unarmed toward the rider , who dismounted . The two men kissed , rising slightly on their toes and bumping their noses together three times , but keeping their arms closely by their sides . It was our man 's uncle , the outrider for a whole group of Bedouin . For nearly two hours they came , camels and people ambling gently , but certainly , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the winter on the southern fringes of the great desert and were now crossing it to spend the summer at Jabrin , the only oasis in the Empty Quarter . There they would halt and a few of their party would go on to Riyadh or some large community to sell some of their two hundred camels . They would buy rice , clothing , sugar , flour , tomato paste , utensils , and perhaps a luxury , such as a rifle . Thus stocked for another year , they would gather dates at the oasis and wander forth again into the sands . Such was the regular cycle of their lives . For them we were an event . As each man arrived he came over to inspect us and , by the rules of hospitality , to share our lunch . The women , on the other hand , took great trouble to avoid us . " Perhaps more important than anything else we saw in the desert was the unusual spectacle of a working religion . In Riyadh and in the villages around the desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , it appeared , it was an essential part of life . Very rapidly you learn not to be pained that a man to whom you give something regards it as Allah 's bounty , not yours  --  for he would give you anything you asked for . Very easily you come to accept that if you have behaved today exactly as you behaved yesterday , then a misfortune or a piece of luck is the will of Allah . Fatalism , when indeed the slightest stroke of fate may changeyour destiny , seems not so feeble a concept . " The Bedouin are a totally civilized people , i f a primitive one . Their lives are guided by a simple , unfanatical belief in Allah . They kill easily but they are deeply shocked by torture . They have the universal Arab attitude toward sex  --  it is to be had as often as possible and as quickly as possible . " As 1 watched a child working , a six-year-old boy who led a camel to and fro for an hour , pulling up the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights and wrongs of his future . The children seemed never to have time to play , yet they were plainly as mischievous as other boys . I watched one of them , in the early dawn , creep into a huge water skin on a camel 's back , hoping by hiding to be able to ride instead of walk for the first few hours of the day . his father found him , walloped him , and they both laughed . " The Arab way of life , rooted in the sands of the desert , has long intrigued anthropologists . But with the vast oil deposits underneath that desert linked to every gas pump in the world , Saudi Arabia takes on an economic significance that belles its centuries-old lifestyle . Not only will oil inevitably change the ways of the Saudis , but current events show its power to change the assumptions , attitudes and power of Western civilization itself . Soon after the establishment of the Saud kingdom in the 1920 's , a severe economic crisis caused by the world slump hit the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca  --  the nation 's financial mainstay . For a mess of potage. in this case 5120,000 in gold , King ibn Saud granted an oil concession to what became known as ARAMCO , a consortium of U.S. oil companies . From the wells of eastern Arabia came the first oil in 1938 . The outbreak of World War II brought the next round of problems . The much-needed product could not escape the Axis U-boats . Again lbn Saud turned to the United States for aid : his kingdom urgently required $10 million a year to survive . Washington was at first dubious but quickly saw that the well-being of Saudi Arabia was vital to the defense of this country . Harry Hopkins , Roosevelt 's chief assistant , ruefully concluded that the money should be provided , although it was hard to " call that outfit a ' democracy . ' " The money was duly handed over in return for a USAF airbase near the oilfields at Dhahran . America now had a base independent of the British positions at Cairo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okinawa . In February 1945 , King Ibn Saud met the President on board a U.S. warship in the Red Sea . As a result of that meeting Saudi Arabia joined the Allied powers for the last months of the war . Shortly after the end of the war relations between the two countries declined again during the first " Arab oil scare . " U.S. aid , however , continued unabated and by 1947 lend-lease financing totaled $100 million . Industrial capital also poured in . By 1950 , ARAMCO completed its $200-million Tapline oil pipeline which brought Saudi oil to the Mediterranean for use by the Sixth Fleet , among others . The company also furnished the king with a prestige railway from the oil-producing port of Dammam to the capital city of Riyadh . With some deft sidestepping into politics , for which some U.S. companies have since become notorious , ARAMCO also advised and trained pro-Saudi dissidents who were challenging British rule in the neighboring Sultanate of Oman . The on-again , off-again relations between the two nations entered a new phase upon the death of Ibn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek millionaire Aristotle Onassis and scorned the advances of the United States . The following year , in tones similar to the present ill feeling , Saudi Arabia complained that the $4.1 million figure for U.S. aid was too small in comparison with the aid being given to Israel . Instead of imposing an oil embargo , the government slapped United States fingers by placing a month-to-month renewal status on the base at Dhahran once the lease had run out in 1956 . With the Suez crisis in the following year , the international seesaw shifted again . The U.S. now attempted to woo the Arab conservatives through the Eisenhower doctrine , the new King Saud visited Washington , and the President broke tradition by going to welcome him at the airport . The cordiality paid off in a five-year lease of life for the base at Dhahran and Saudi Arabia received U.S. weaponry for an army twice its current size . Two short years later , Washington was busy supporting Prince Faisal in his bid to oust the king who had received such fanfare in the nation 's capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravages of his incompetent and wasteful predecessor  --  and making his kingdom a bulwark against revolutionary nationalism . In order to bolster this status quo , the U.S. sent jets and paratroopers to the country in 1963 , when Egyptians attacking in North Yemen appeared to cast a hungry eye on the oil-rich neighbor . Spurred by U.S. arms shipments and the threat of attack by fellow Arabs , the Saudis have built their forces to a strength of 36,000 infantry and 3,500 air personnel backed by seventy com ? bat planes . Further expansion is currently planned . This military preeminence has enabled the country to dominate the surrounding states and stifle any possible internal opposition . The industrial development of the Sixties can only be enhanced in this decade by the massive influx of wealth , already running at $8 billion annually , which will accrue from the steep increase in the cost of crude oil and the recently completed agreement to assume a 51 percent state control of oil production by 1983 . King Faisal will open a new $75 million hospital in Riyadh in early 1975 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stands on the edge of Rub al Khali  --  the great Empty Quarter  --  where many of Arabia 's fiercest and purest nomads live , maintaining the quality of life , the bare bones of existence , that have made the country a sort of moon-on-earth survival proving ground for the human spirit . The hospital will serve both the urban population of Riyadh with its half million population and the vast mountains and deserts that still frugally nourish large segments of the country 's people . There will be 250 beds with a large staff of doctors and technicians from western Europe . Within a few years most of these people will have trained Saudis to fill their positions , though it is anticipated most of the physicians will still come from Europe or America , or if native , be t rained there . Dr. Rifat Alsayed Ali , personal physician to the King , said , " We are building the best possible referral health care facility for the people of the Middle East , and we are determined to secure the most competent management available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital Corporation of America , which has a contract extending to 1980 to recruit employees and medical staff and to manage the hospital . There will be eight operating theaters , obstetrics , pediatrics , coronary and intensive care units , inhalation and physical therapy , emergency facilities , complete X-ray and laboratory facilities and a highly sophisticated medical computer system . The building is located on a ninety-acre tract , evidence of the vastness  --  even in its cities  --  of space in Saudi Arabia , which is half the size of the continental U.S. John C. Neff , presi-dent of the Hospital Corporation of Amer -- sees the hospital as an international community which will heal ancient enmities as well as diseases . Because of the nomadic lives of the Arabs they often find boundary disputes  --  the cause of most wars  --  a displeasing concept which , in its turn , has displeased neighbors who would engage in combat over lines drawn in the sand . But when one of the leaders of the Trucial States -- say , Yemen , or Oman  --  is in Riyadh , ill , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , flare-ups between the countries become unlikely . Although the hospital will include a private utility system , commissary and housing for the hospital staff , it is hoped staffers will slowly pervade the cut stone squares of the city . And that the city will pervade  --  just as gently  --  the hospital compound . One comes to Riyadh from Jeddah ( the town closest to Mecca , still largely forbidden to Westerners ) , or from Dhahran ( the ARAMCO 's oil headquarters on the Arabian Gulf ) . Dhahran is almost a parking-lot city  --  a space of buildings and squares that had nothing to adjust to , since its beginnings never coagulated into the usual desert community . Jeddah is much more the mysterious East of purdah and pilgrimage . The houses jut out over the street like Elizabethan dwellings and almost touch each other toward their top stories . Carved wooden bays catch the few breezes that lift themselves up from the Red Sea and the mountains of Eritrea fifty kilometers inland from the opposite shore . The new King Faisal Specialist Hospital is Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing fifty-two hospitals in twelve states . Neff is not worried about his organization 's performance : " Although our management contract is for seven years , we are hopeful of developing a longer term relationship with this hospital . " In spite of the primitive way of life , by Western standards , of most of its people , Saudi Arabia , by throwing down its trump card dramatically , has achieved world power status overnight . She can manipulate her vast oil resources , her vast foreign currency reserves , at will . Given the present delicate balance of world power , other nations do not dare to overreact to her fanatical , even whimsical acts . This Christmas , when a bountiful Saudi Arabia deigned to allow oil to flow again  --  to friendly nations  --  a grateful world bowed obligingly and doubled its payments . The future will see frenetic attempts by other powers to break this dependence on oil . For Saudi Arabia , the great test will come from within . The coffers of oil revenue lie locked beside the bed of the ruling Saud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and equitably enough to allay the growing frustrations of an articulate , western-trained middle class ? No matter what happens , the desert with its mysterious beauty and strength will remain .
