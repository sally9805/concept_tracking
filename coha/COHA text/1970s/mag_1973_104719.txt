As if the blasted sports world were not confusing enough already , what with male and female golf tours , bowling tours and tennis tours  --  was it Billie Jean Whitworth who bowled that perfect game in San Jose , or Slammin ' Sammy Petraglia ?  --  the men 's racket squad has now doubled its size and split in two . Yes , World Championship of Tennis , the international circuit run by Texas zillionaire Lamar Hunt , is now twins , cleverly named Group A and Group B. Each is headed by a slight Australian , A by Rod Laver , B by Ken Rose-wall . At this time it is not known which group has fewer cavities , but A definitely has fewer Czechoslovakians. // Group A made its debut last week in the $50,000 Saga Bay Tennis Classic on the asphalt courts of the University of Miami , a five-day fling that had all sorts of pleasant diversions . Cliff Richey and Nikki Pilic were on hand to fuss and fume at officials , always a jolly sight . Aussie vaudeville star John Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he chased an angled shot , landed in a pretty girl 's lap and then called for his opponent to hit it there again . For those who did not care for sideshows , Wimbledon champion and Davis Cup hero Stan Smith , known as Godzilla to some , Mr. Clean to others , was there for his first taste of WCT combat . And the 34-year-old master , Laver , was returning after a more than three-month layoff forced by an aching back . // The rest apparently did Laver some good because he got to the finals as expected this time , where his opponent was not second-seeded Smith or third-seeded Cliff Drysdale or any of the 12 seeds . Instead it was 21-year-old Dick Stockton , who just last June was graduated summa cum laude in tennis from Trinity University in Texas . He was the 1972 NCAA champion , which does not exactly compare in the credentials department with Laver 's two Grand Slams . Stockton played well in the finals , and even took Rocket to a tiebreaker in the first set , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and won in straight sets 7-6 , 6-3 , 7-5. // Laver collected $10,000 for winning the singles and later in the day he picked up $900 as his share of the doubles first prize . Since he had already won $1,500 in a pro-am earlier in the week he left Florida with $12,400 and high hopes that his back would hold up under the grind . All this , said a press-box wit , and he did n't even have to tip a caddie . // This new twin-tour idea was made possible when WCT and the International Lawn Tennis Federation signed a truce last year . WCT had an international panel of 29 sportswriters rate the world 's players  --  Laver , Rosewall , John Newcombe of Australia and Smith finishing in that order at the top  --  right down to No. 125 , Paul Gerken . WCT invited the top 64 and a few substitutes to compete and most accepted . WCT then filled the berths by going down the list in order . A fellow named Stockton was ranked 65th . No. 3 Newcombe and No. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dividing the 64 players into two nearly equal groups , a task demanding the skills of a diplomat , travel agent and juggler , was the headache of Welshman Mike Davies , WCT executive director . Every day for six weeks he fiddled with the lists , feeling like a little boy preparing the rosters for a dice-baseball league  --  toying with the fates of Babe Ruth and Willie Mays on his kitchen table . There could be no divorces among such successful , longtime doubles teams as Okker-Riessen and Laver-Emerson . Group A was going to South Africa , so Arthur Ashe , a black , would no doubt prefer to be in B , away from apartheid , but that meant he would not be playing in his hometown , Richmond , Va . Ray Moore of South Africa normally would have been put in A , but he wanted to be with B 's free-spirited contingent , Jeff Borowiak , Haroon Rahim and Torben Ulrich . And so on , a thousand combinations swirling in Davies ' mind . // He finally settled on two lists , heaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling again . Joaquin Loyo-Mayo of Mexico , no bigger than a chihuahua and apparently just as flighty , dropped out to work for a cigarette company . Alexander Metreveli of the U.S.S.R. joined up and had to be put in B because his country does not truck with South Africa , which led to Frank Froehling being transferred to A , which led to Charlie Pasarell being unhappy in B because Froehling had been his doubles partner , all of which made Davies wake up screaming in the night . // Well , Loyo-Mayo gave up tobacco and came back , Davies managed to reunite Pasarell and Froehling in A , and after a few million other adjustments WCT-73 was ready to wend its merry , bifurcated way . Each group will play 11 tournaments , A starting in the U.S. and Canada and then going abroad , B doing the reverse . Six of the 22 finals will be televised live by NBC . The top finishers in singles and doubles at each event will be awarded money , of course , and points . The four doubles teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal May 3-May 6 for $80,000 in prize money , the most by far ever offered for doubles . A week later in Dallas the eight leading singles players  --  again , four from each group  --  will be clawing each other for shares of $100,000. // Otherwise the twain shall meet only twice during the season , at two all-star events , the Aetna World Cup in Hartford , Conn. , and the CBS Tennis Classic in Hilton Head , S.C. , both in March , with neither counting in the point derby . // A continuing annoyance to WCT staff members has been their inability to dream up jazzy names for their two caravans . A and B are not only dull but also imply there is a difference in quality . The traditional National-American designation is inappropriate since 19 countries are represented in the two troupes and nine countries will host tournaments . Blacks-Whites might cause some nervousness in Johannesburg and , besides , any pair of colors could confuse fans because of the pros ' rainbow wardrobes , e.g. , red-haired Laver of the Blues playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s also came up with : Lavers-Rosewalls , Globetrotters-Nomads , World-Global , East-West , Faults-Double Faults , Forehands-Backhands , Aces-Slams , Aces-Deuces , Ad In-Ad Out and Ad Infinitum-Ad Nauseum . None of them quite struck the desired note . // So let 's have a contest . Any reader who conies up with a pair of names that wow the judges and are accepted by WCT will receive a snip from Stan Smith 's mustache and a portfolio of photographs , Cliff Rickey 's Greatest Glares. // For Laver the A-B business was probably less important than another innovation , the hiring of two traveling trainers , one for the U.S. and one for abroad , a move he has been suggesting for two years . After each match last week Laver put the trainer to good use . The redhead would swig his beer , then have his still-weak back massaged . Wednesday night he and Roy Emerson gave Stockton and 20-year-old Brian Gottfried a lesson in how to play doubles , but afterward the two kids were showered and dressed while Laver and Emmo were still being strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final by beating Edison Mandarino of Brazil , Nikki Pilic of Yugoslavia , fellow Aussie Emerson and Bob Lutz of the U.S. , but it was not exactly a pleasant stroll through Sydney . He was inconsistent , or " scratchy , " as he put it , yet he seemed able to turn on the steam and let loose the shots when he needed to . He was forced into three tiebreakers along the way and won all . He played Pilic at night on a damp court but he won in straight sets . Emerson routed him 6-1 in their first set and had him down 6-5 in the third , but Rod in one streak won nine straight points and took it 7-6 . Against Lutz he paced himself through the end of the second set when he saw he had little chance to catch up , but had plenty of tricks and energy left to win the third 6-2. // Stockton 's climb was smoother . He has an edge over most of the other rookies because he played five tournaments on the 1972 WCT tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off by upsetting Charlie Pasarell and then beat Ove Bengston of Sweden . He missed facing third-seeded Cliff Drysdale of South Africa in the third round when Drysdale was eliminated by the flu . Stockton went on to wallop Jim McManus , 10 years his senior , and then challenge Alexander . // The handsome Alexander , also 21 , had bashed Smith the night before 6-4 , 6-2 with strong serves and strong returns of serve , but he had to stick around and play a rain-postponed doubles match that did not end until two a.m . He was not in rare form the next day under a hot sun , but Stockton was . He served beautifully , blasting cross-court winners a la Laver and probably played his finest match , winning 6-3 , 6-2 . He joyfully leaped the net for the handshake , not for the moment considering that he , lowly No. 65 , would be playing No. 1 the next day . // Despite the surprising showing by Stockton and the sharpness at times of Lutz , no one at this early stage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American in Group A , or even the top player period . He seemed to accept all the minor and major setbacks of the week with his usual calm . On the first day he arrived without his shoes and had to borrow a pair from Bengston , who at 6 ' 5 " is one of the few tennis tourists taller than Stan and with feet to match . Smith was fortunate that 5 ' 6 " , 130-pound Harold Solomon , his Davis Cup teammate , was n't the only guy around . On the second day Smith and doubles partner Lutz were socked with small fines for wearing different-colored shirts in a match . // Even the lopsided loss to Alexander did not cause Smith much distress . He remembered that he had been smashed by hard-serving Vladimir Zednik in his first tournament last year . // " It 's a matter of timing , moving , positioning , " he said . " I 'm not doing any of that well yet . I expected to start slowly . There 's a long way to go  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
