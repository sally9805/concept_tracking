Of all the men around former President Richard Nixon , probably none was more hated than Chuck Colson , top hatchet man and tireless inventor of dirty tricks . There was a sense of national satisfaction when he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served seven months in jail . Now , in a book to be published in mid-February , Colson , 44 , tells how , in embracing evangelical Christianity , he learned the error of his ways-and of his fallen chiefs . Born Again ( Chosen Books , a religious publisher ) is an uncomplaining and contrite testament to the belief , renewed each generation , that power corrupts . <P> Colson denies that he said he would run over his grandmother for Nixon . But he admits that he might as well have made the remark . His loyalty to Nixon was total . Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman once warned him : " Richard Nixon will use anybody . Remember that . When he does n't need you , he 'll discard you . " But Colson thought he was somehow exempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at once arrogant and vindictive , reflective and melancholy , and finally desperate and isolated . He is a man incapable of savoring his triumphs , for beyond them his enemies were still lurking . While his finger slowly circled the rim of a wineglass , Nixon told his aides : " One day we 'll get them-we 'll get them on the ground where we want them . And we 'll stick our heels in , step on them hard and twist . " His eyes darted to Kissinger . " Henry knows what I mean-just like you do in the negotiations , Henry-get them on the floor and step on them , crush them , show no mercy . " <P> Colson reports that he eagerly agreed with Nixon . Kissinger " smiled and nodded , " and Haldeman said nothing , but had a look " of hand-rubbing expectation . Only Ehrlichman , expressionless and often a lonely voice of moderation , jerked his head back and stared at the ceiling ... A Holy War was declared against the enemy ... The seeds of destruction were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right Thing . For Colson , Nixon was at his best when he seemed to make a decision on principle . When the President ordered all-out bombing after the North Vietnamese offensive in the spring of 1972 , Colson warned him that the action might cost him the election . " So what , " snapped Nixon . " It 's the right thing to do . " <P> After Nixon 's reelection , Colson left the White House to practice law . As the Watergate scandal unfolded , he was occasionally summoned to the Oval Office , where he observed a President in alarming decline . Nixon , ironically , feared that his office was being bugged by his enemies ( it was his own bugging system that brought him down ) . " I do n't think I can trust anybody , not even the secretaries . " <P> It was about this time that Colson 's thoughts , he reports , turned more frequently to God-with the aid of one of the White House 's most notorious enemies , former Democratic Senator Harold Hughes . While Colson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members of Colson 's prayer group offered to serve out the rest of his term for him on the basis of an old statute they had unearthed . " For the first time , " writes Colson , " I felt truly free , even as the fortunes of my life seemed at their lowest ebb . "
