A conference room at Division Headquarters , Schofield Barracks , Hawaii . Monday morning , November 1970 . Two small tables sit apart , one for Captain Martin and the other for the Commanding Officer . Between them is a rolling office chair . On a third table upstage are two wooden Japanese boxes . Seven chairs sit to one side . Enter Captain Martin , a young career officer . He places files and papers on the two small tables and pushes the rolling chair to the center of the room . He double checks the room . Then he opens the door and speaks to people outside it . MARTIN Please come in . ( Enter Sergeant Bates , Lorna Ann Bates , Colonel Moore , Katherine Nomura , Sergeant Major Ruggles , and Lucy Lake . ) Good morning . Thank you for coming . Please take a seat . As soon as the Commanding Officer arrives , we 'll begin . ( They sit in the chairs . Martin sits , and checks them off his list . Enter the Co . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The Commanding Officer of Schofield Barracks . ( The military personnel rise . ) C. O. Thank you for coming . Please be seated . ( To Martin . ) Are they all here ? p. 3 MARTIN Sir , all but one . A Mr. Edward Roundhouse . C. O. Who 's he ? MARTIN He owns several restaurants on Oahu . C. O. All right . We 'll start . ( Quietly and politely . ) Ladies and gentlemen , this is an unusual and preliminary inquiry . It is authorized not by the Code of Military Justice , or by the Provost Marshall , but by a United States Army General Order , issued to me by my superior officer , the former Commanding General of Schofield Barracks . We will ask you some questions . You may answer or not . You may add whatever you wish . We thank you very much for whatever you have to say . Captain . ( He sits at his table . ) MARTIN Master Sergeant Norvel T. Bates , please . ( He indicates the desk chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you are not required to answer under oath , or against your wishes ? BATES I understand , sir . MARTIN You are on the General 's staff ? BATES I am the General 's Enlisted Aide . MARTIN We have a note here , from the General , speaking of you very highly . You were aware of his esteem ? p. 4 BATES ( In sorrow . ) We knew each other pretty well . MARTIN You played a large part in his preparations . Can you describe that for us ? BATES I 'll do my best . Late Saturday morning , I was summoned to his quarters . He handed me a sealed manila envelope . In it was a General Order he had written out by hand and signed . I was ordered to process it myself , by myself . ( To the Co . ) I did , and that was the order you received , sir , to hold this inquiry . C. O. Right , Sergeant . Go ahead . BATES Then he asked me to sit down . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said something that surprised me . He told me he and his wife were writing a sort of skit . To do at the Officers ' Club . I tried to show polite interest . But then they asked me to help them . MARTIN Write the skit ? BATES No , sir . Be in it . They wanted me to read part of it aloud at the Officers ' Club party . They said , " Here it is , look at it . " MARTIN What did you think of it ? BATES I thought it was silly . I did n't understand it . When I saw one of the last lines said , " I will wait for you in heaven , my noble husband , " I thought , oh Lord . But , sir , I ca n't tell you how much I admire the General and his wife . And if what they wanted to do was make fools of themselves at an Officers ' Club party , I was glad to help out . p. 5 MARTIN What else were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was leaving , the General gave me keys to his front door and verbal instructions . He told me no matter what happened Saturday night , I was to return to his quarters directly after the party and take possession of papers I would find on a card table in the living room . And I did that . In shock , but I did it . MARTIN Describe the papers . BATES First , the will . The General and his wife liquidated their estate . It was a lot of money , and they left it all to an Oriental-American orphanage in Honolulu . There is a certified check already in the mail to that orphanage now . I put it there , by his order . MARTIN How much was it ? BATES Three hundred and fifty-five thousand dollars . They gave that orphanage everything they had . MARTIN What else did you find ? BATES Many resignations , from all sorts of things he belonged to . On top , his resignation from the American Archery Association , and from the Army of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  of course , their bodies . MARTIN What about them ? BATES Notarized document , donating their bodies to a civilian research hospital in Honolulu . p. 6 MARTIN Thank you , Sergeant . Anything else ? BATES Yes , sir . This envelope , sealed . It says on the front that I am to open it and read its contents at the end of this inquiry , if as the General directed , it is held here . If not , I am to destroy it . His signature is on it , there . C. O. Let me see that please . ( Martin takes the envelope quickly to the Co . He looks at it carefully , and gives it back . ) That 's what you 'll do , Sergeant . As ordered . BATES Yes , sir . C. O. Thank you very much . Is there anything you yourself would like to add ? BATES Yes , sir . I want to say that I still admire the General . He was the best soldier I ever saw . MARTIN Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . ( Bates goes to his seat . A Japanese woman takes the chair . ) Miss Nomura , this is an informal inquiry , conducted along lines suggested by the General in his order . You may answer or not and we are obliged for your help . Do you understand ? MISS NOMURA Oh , yes . MARTIN How long have you been in the service of the General ? MISS NOMURA Four days . p. 7 MARTIN How did you come to work for him ? MISS NOMURA I was sent to him from a commercial bureau . I fitted his requirements . MARTIN What were your duties ? MISS NOMURA Very light secretarial work , for his wife . I know now , of course , it was to read what was written . Which also explains his requirements . MARTIN What were they ? MISS NOMURA They were for a female with some knowledge of Japanese culture . Who should have one other qualification I prefer not to mention . He had trouble finding me . MARTIN And you read it aloud , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARTIN What did you think of it ? MISS NOMURA I thought it was very beautiful . MARTIN Why ? MISS NOMURA I knew what it was they had written . It was a shinju . MARTIN And what is that ? MISS NOMURA A love suicide . A kind of play , in which lovers , who can not live together any longer , commit suicide together . There have been a great many of them . p. 8 MARTIN Do you mean plays , or love suicides ? MISS NOMURA Both . MARTIN I see . Now , Miss Nomura  --  MISS NOMURA Please . One other thing . It is not a sin or a disgrace . It is not an act of psychological selfhatred . It is release from illusion . It is embrace of eternal truth . Therir life then becomes a poem they leave behind , and is considered a great achievement . Many believe they are taken directly into heaven and are reborn on lotus leaves . Thank you . MARTIN I see . Now , Miss Nomura  --  C. O. ( Breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some idea of the actual purpose of the play ? MISS NOMURA Oh , yes . C. O. You did ? MISS NOMURA I said yes . C. O. You mean you knew Saturday night they were going to kill themselves ? MISS NOMURA I knew they were going to act out a shinju . It did occur to me they might be in earnest . C. O. Then pardon me , Miss Nomura , why did n't you tell anyone ? MISS NOMURA That would have spoiled a shinju . ( Pause . ) And who would have believed me ? Would you ? p. 9 C. O. What else did they tell you about what they were going to do ? MISS NOMURA Nothing . I was to meet with Sergeant Bates at the Officers ' Club at about ten o'clock . We were to read our parts while they performed on the dance floor . C. O. And you understood what they might really do ? MISS NOMURA I said yes . ( Pause . ) If a man and his wife decide the home they loved has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that impossible to understand ? C. O. Thank you very much . MARTIN Is there anything you wish to add ? MISS NOMURA Oh , yes . I am glad I saw what I saw . ( She gets up and sits again in her chair . The CO stares at her for a moment , then nods to Captain Martin . ) C. O. Who 's next ? MARTIN Sergeant Major Reuben H. Ruggles , please . ( A calm , quietly arrogant soldier in his forties takes the chair . He carries a handsome swagger stick . ) Sergeant Major , do you understand the informal nature of these proceedings ? That you do n't have to answer a question if you do n't want to ? RUGGLES I do , sir . p. 10 MARTIN The General tells us here that you first served under him in Korea . As a platoon sergeant in a line company . RUGGLES That 's right . MARTIN His directive characterizes you as an outstanding combat NCO . C. O. And I can certainly agree with that . RUGGLES I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Sergeant Major , what the General asks for now , is your opinion of him . RUGGLES Yes , sir . ( Quickly . ) He was a great General , it was my privilege to serve under him . MARTIN There 's a note here that you had a conversation with him , in his office , last week . Is that correct ? ( Ruggles , surprised , pauses then nods . ) Can you tell us about that ? RUGGLES ( Slowly . ) If I have to . MARTIN You do n't have to . The General asks you to . RUGGLES Oh , he does , does he ? MARTIN Can you tell us about your conversation with him ? RUGGLES To some degree , Captain , sir . A private , D Company , 19th Infantry Brigade , a black man , had a nervous breakdown on the rifle range Friday morning . Live rounds . It was dangerous . He was disarmed by big Georgia Sergeant with a big red neck , who fractured the black man 's skull . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 11 MARTIN What did he do ? RUGGLES Several ineffective things . Then he consulted me . MARTIN And what did you do ? RUGGLES I figured the racial incident , or whatever was going to happen , might happen on Saturday , the next morning , at the full Division parade . The General sent his black cadre around Friday night and posted all his bulletins . Saturday morning , at the parade , we 'd see . Now , in two months , a black Sergeant , 12th Artillery , after his twenty years , was supposed to get out . Slated for a little parade . Two horns and a drum outside a quadrangle , where some Major would shake his hand , and that would be that . So , on Friday night , I had a chat with a Personnel Specialist and then another one with our black Artillery Sergeant . I told him he was going to retire the next morning . He really did n't want to retire the next morning , but I convinced him . MARTIN Of what ? RUGGLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this Division massed for parade . Band started , flags unfurled and when seven thousand combat ready troops thundered past the reviewing stand , with tanks and artillery and choppers whirling in the air  --  wind , flags , the great Army in all its glory  --  who do you think was standing up there to receive all those salutes ? The General and his black Sergeant , honored on the day of his retirement . Whose name , by the way is Caesar . That 's right . Sergeant Nelson O. Caesar . Well , everybody saluted the colors and the colors saluted everybody and it was all just one big happy family . p. 12 MARTIN In other words , Sergeant Major , what you did was put a black man in a window . Is that what you 're so proud of ? ( Ruggles stops laughing , looks mildly but dangerously at Captain Martin . ) RUGGLES You best not talk to me like that , son , sir . I am nearing the end or a long and honorable career . You ai n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a talk with you . What did you say to each other ? If you please . ( Ignoring Martin , Ruggles speaks directly to the Co . ) RUGGLES General , sir , what do I have to do here ? Six weeks before I retire ! I am only an enlisted man . I respectfully ask you to direct me . C. O. Follow your conscience and say what you please . Whatever you say will be to your credit . RUGGLES ( Doubtfully . ) Yeah . Thank you , sir . If that 's what you want . C. O. That 's what we want . RUGGLES After the parade , he took me into his office , closed the door , pulled out a bottle of Jack Daniels . And we had a drink together . MARTIN And that was all ? RUGGLES No , that was n't all . He thanked me for the saving of his ass . Because putting Caesar up there probably stopped a race riot , and certainly saved his ass . He was grateful , or something . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 13 MARTIN What did he say ? RUGGLES Lots of dumb things nobody knows the answer to . If I really thought the new all-professional Army could become a black dumping ground . If the Army was getting like a big corporation that could plan but could n't fight . Things like that . MARTIN What did you say ? RUGGLES I said I did n't know , what else ? I reckoned a mostly black Army would have mostly black officers and mostly black parades , like in Haiti , and I reckoned men would always fight but I was n't sure about officers . He did n't like any of that , and changed the subject . MARTIN To what ? RUGGLES Sergeant Caesar . " Good Soldier ? " " Damn right , " I said . " Just like his namesake . Julius Caesar served Rome , and so did Sergeant Nelson O. Caesar and so do I. We serve Rome for twenty years and Rome serves us for twenty years and we all got it made . " I do n't see the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , " I said , " maybe that 's because you 're not a Roman , really , and Sergeant Caesar is and I am . And if you 're not , then I pity you . " C. O. Sergeant Major , you spoke that way to your commanding General ? RUGGLES Why not , sir ? I 'd just saved his damned ass for him , had n't I ? One chance in twenty years to talk turkey to a General . Shit , I let go . I told him the Army he believed in did n't exist . That it was a god damned fairy tale he was told at West Point . That I found out what the Army really was in Korea . " Korea ? " he said , politely , as if remembering the country was all I 'd meant . " Yes , sir , Korea , " I said . " When you and me was young , General , and we made our bargains with Rome . " " I do n't know what your bargain was , Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my country . " " Mine was to kill , " I said , " and serve myself . To do what I was told to do , so my country would serve me . The trouble with you is , General , you just do n't like what your country wants you to do . " He did n't fancy that idea , neither , and changed the subject again . p. 14 C. O. To ? RUGGLES Nostalgia . Maybe he thought that would be safe . " Waht I remember about Korea , " he said , " is great long lines of marching men , ice cold nights , bleak Asian skies , and the hard , lonely duty of serving your country . " " What I remember , " I said , " is a damn good Roman Soldier staying alive . White men , black men , Rome takes us on . Then murders us , if it needs to . But if we survive , we have earned our good name and we are honorably retired with it . ' Fair enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesar . Duty , honor , country , like they say at West Point . But hell fire , for me and Caesar , it was n't to die for our god damn duty , it was to kill for the god damn Army ! Kill for it and live ! Tell me it 's hard ? You think I do n't know that , General ? I 've seen a few people die in the war . My SON , my own SON , HE died in the god damn war , General ! But not me . I 'm alive , and I kill for this Army and live ! Make money off the fucking P.X. for it , and live ! Serve up slant-eyed pussy to Generals like you for it , and live ! You do n't have to tell me my duty , General . I know all about it . You give it to me and I done it , and so did my boy , whatever it was . He did n't live , but I did , to my honorable old age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain ! I understand what the real Army is , and I would rather have the common virtue of a down-in-the-dirt , dog-face killer , than the glory of a fake like you ! " ( Pause . ) And that was the end of the interview . Well , sir ? p. 15 C. O. It 's a good thing you 're retiring in six weeks . Anything else ? RUGGLES As a matter of fact , there is . When the General took over this Division , he gave me and the two other Sergeant Majors a swagger stick . This one here . He said he was n't the smartest man in the world but he was smart enough to know who understood the Army : old time Regimental Sergeant Majors . He was always going to depend on us to tell him the truth when no one else would . Well , that 's exactly what I did . C. O. Please remain in the room . RUGGLES Thank you , sir . I prefer not to . ( He walks deliberately out of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General 's list is Lucy Lake . C. O. Is she here ? LUCY LAKE Yes , I 'm here . ( An extremely plain , blunt , white-haired , down-to-earth old New England woman takes the stand . ) C. O. Miss Lake , in his directive , the General tenders you an apology for taking up more of your valuable time . And speaking for the rest of us , allow me to thank you very much for coming here today . LUCY LAKE All right . p. 16 C. O. Poets are not usually close friends with Generals . Am I right about that ? LUCY LAKE No . I knew Archie Wavell in World War II very well . He loved poets . C. O. A British General , I believe . In America , however ? LUCY LAKE America however , nope . Rare . C. O. You understand , Miss Lake , the nature of these proceedings ? LUCY LAKE I get the idea . C. O. How did you come to meet the General ? LUCY LAKE I did n't . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last summer . C. O. Can you tell us about this meeting please ? LUCY LAKE Breadloaf Conference , Middlebury , Vermont . Writers meet would-be writers , who pay to come , listen , and have their material read . C. O. Mike had been writing what  --  poetry ? LUCY LAKE Yep . C. O. And he went there on his leave ? LUCY LAKE Yep . C. O. Go on . p. 17 LUCY LAKE That 's it . I was working with the poets . We all met . MARTIN What was your opinion of the General 's poetry ? LUCY LAKE Not just his . His wife 's too . MARTIN Their poetry , then . C. O. What did you think of it ? LUCY LAKE Oh , they were dilettantes , but not impossible . Bad , but not always completely . But , poets , you see , love very specific things , the concrete particulars of life , while Generals can be general . You could see that wrong with him . He did n't understand it at first , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a poem . Bringing disparate elements together . Yet I felt it was his wife who was truly remarkable . C. O. As a person , or a poet ? LUCY LAKE Both . Poets are people , General , even when they may seems mysterious to you as generals do to me . She was a lovely woman . It was my pleasure to know her . MARTIN Did they say or do anything unusual at this writers ' conference ? LUCY LAKE No . He was very self-conscious . Said he was retired . He and his wife seldom came to the parties with everybody else . They worked on their poems . Took longs walks . Looked at Vermont , the mountains and the stars . They had a quiet , enriching cultural experience , just like it says in the brochure . p. 18 MARTIN How about you , may I ask ? LUCY LAKE I was drunk most of the time . It 's a fun two weeks . C. O. When did you hear from them again ? LUCY LAKE Just a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii . Money . I was in the newspaper , and the General called . So I spent the last two weeks with them in a little beach cottage they 'd rented for me . C. O. Miss Lake , you have been seeing them for the past two weeks ? LUCY LAKE Yep . C. O. Well ? LUCY LAKE Well ? MARTIN Well , have n't you any  --  did n't you notice  --  LUCY LAKE I noticed a lot ! Some of it I may tell you about , and some of it I may not . You ask the questions , and I 'll make up my mind as we go along . C. O. Certainly . But the first question is this : You 're hostile to everything here , are n't you ? LUCY LAKE Yep . C. O. Okay . In your meetings and conversations with the General and his wife , did they ever indicate anything unusual about themselves ? p. 19 LUCY LAKE General , you are going to have to be more specific . C. O. I 'll do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARTIN Criticize the Army ? The country ? LUCY LAKE Never . MARTIN Did they exhibit psychological peculiarities ? Show nervous strain ? Act or think in strange ways ? LUCY LAKE No . I did all that . They were fine , always quite composed . We simply talked about poetry and watched the sea . They drank a little , I drank a lot , and exhibited psychological peculiarities . MARTIN I see . LUCY LAKE Good . C. O. But Miss Lake , did n't anything about the General say anything to you  --  about his despair , his impending suicide ? LUCY LAKE Nope . C. O. Well , perhaps the man was trying , Miss Lake , and you were too drunk to pay him any attention ! Is that a possibility ? LUCY LAKE They talked about writing something Japanese , using poetry and masks . I suggested they read Chickamatsu . They liked one of his plays in particular . From what I hear , their own was a copy of it . p. 20 C. O. What play is that ? LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . ( Pause . ) That was the last visit . C. O. Miss Lake , what did you think about an American Army General and his wife doing such a thing ? LUCY LAKE I thought it unutterably sad . Sobering . At their age , watching them try to find a life in poetry . They began like good children , slightly worshipful . Stealing quietly into the world of art , a magic forest they thought filled with mossy groves and dappled pastures and innocent living things . Finding instead the pits and swamps and the true difficulties of the animals within  --  ahh ! C. O. Please take your time . LUCY LAKE Well , Sheila . What a waste ! She must have been so cheerful once ! Not beautiful , but  --  radiant , whole , a good American girl ! A Navy nurse , picked up by a young Army Captain , as they stood wondering in front of the great golden Buddha at Kamakura . They had just conquered Japan . So they shacked up , took a trip . Nikko , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they married . They loved each other , Japan , and the Army . In twenty years , they managed to spend only seven west of Hawaii . And then it all  --  well . C. O. And then ? p. 21 LUCY LAKE Oh , Jesus , General ! If you do n't know , how can I tell you ? Ask me another ! C. O. Well , I do n't know , Miss Lake ! And , yes , I certainly will ask you another . The General and his wife killed themselves . Do you know why ? LUCY LAKE And if I do , and if I tell you , do you suppose I 'd believe you would ever take me seriously ? C. O. Well , why do you think you were asked to come here ? LUCY LAKE Oh , because my name was on that list . For the recording session . C. O. The what ? LUCY LAKE Recording session . That 's all this is . We 're his secretaries , scribes ! The General has us here writing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We were all used . Somehow . Still are . ( Pause . ) Bringing his disparate elements together . C. O. That may be . LUCY LAKE Has to be . Why were n't you there , by the way ? C. O. At the Officers ' Club ? LUCY LAKE Sure . You were second in command . Number two , right ? C. O. Yes . LUCY LAKE Well , where were you ? p. 22 C. O. In the field . Inspecting a supply base , on another island . LUCY LAKE And who sent you there ? C. O. The General . LUCY LAKE Sure . C. O. In any case , Miss Lake , believe me , whatever you have to say , I will take seriously . LUCY LAKE Promise ? C. O. Promise . LUCY LAKE Okay . Ask . C. O. The General is dead . Why ? LUCY LAKE Because he came to believe , literally now , something dreadful . And his wife had the courage to agree with him . C. O. And what was that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That he had murdered his son . C. O. Miss Lake , the General 's son was a grown man . A combat Marine . He was killed in action in 1965 , near Danang . LUCY LAKE Precisely . C. O. The horrors of war ? Well , my dear Miss Lake . LUCY LAKE Well , my dear General . ( The CO laughs , throws up his hands . ) Yeah , you see ? p. 23 C. O. What ? LUCY LAKE You were going to take me seriously , remember ? C. O. Well , I 'm sorry , but I expected something more worthy of Lucy Lake . LUCY LAKE And I expected you to keep your word . C. O. I beg your pardon . You say the General believed he 'd murdered his son . How ? And now let me ask you to be specific . LUCY LAKE He believed he had done his duty . He believed his duty led to the useless death of this son . He questioned his duty and his country . He decided he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCY LAKE Mo  --  ral lun  --  a  --  tic . C. O. What did doing his duty have to do with the death of his son ? LUCY LAKE It was the murder weapon . The instrument of homicide . C. O. You do n't make sense . LUCY LAKE Call it poison . He had poisoned his son . That help ? ( The CO sits back in his chair , and looks at Martin . ) MARTIN Did the General ever say he 'd murdered his son ? LUCY LAKE Not in words . p. 24 MARTIN Did his wife ? LUCY LAKE No . MARTIN You never overheard them say that ? LUCY LAKE No . MARTIN And you still insist  --  LUCY LAKE Insist the General believed he had murdered his son . And his wife did , too . Yes . C. O. How can you  --  with your book review platitudes  --  insult a good servant of his country , a wonderful father to his son ? Mike and I both had sons killed in action . Mike never pushed his boy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They embraced it ! Mike and his son , my dead boy and I , we were all proud of any life given for our country ! And your pompous attitude here is obscene ! LUCY LAKE Bullshit , General ! Do n't you talk to me about dead children ! Pompous am I ? You son-of-a-bitch , you make those boys serve one solid year in that deathtrap . You watch them die from your helicopters , and then fly home to your bloody promotions ! Do n't call me obscene ! C. O. Oh , please . What do you knoe about military life ? It 's Sheila you keep talking about . Just why were you here , messing about in her life ? LUCY LAKE Old dyke , General ! Who 's been through wars you would never survive ! ( She holds up one hand . ) But . You seem like a decent man . I 'm sorry about your son . We should speak to each other with respect . Mike and I did . p. 25 C. O. So we should . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right . I did stay to be with Sheila . I do n't often find someone I like as much as I liked her . We became good friends . On those afternoons by the sea , we knitted , Sheila and I , and talked about poetry and children . C. O. I ca n't understand that . I knew them longer and better than you did . They grieved . But they knew why their son died . They loved their country as well as their child . They would n't write amateur romantic poetry about that . ( Lucy Lake opens her purse , takes out a piece of paper . ) LUCY LAKE This is a sonnet . Written together . Shall I ? C. O. Yes . ( LUCY Lake reads it critically , like a writing teacher . ) LUCY LAKE ON MAKING LOVE AGAINBut for this night and rain we would n't weep , As that dear face fades slowly from our keep.And we drink gallons , press our souls to sleep , And in this world alone no harvest reap . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend , old fists be furled , As if from sperm and womb we 'd simply hurledHis being , so deep in our ambition curled , Away ! Right now ! Into some better world . ( She looks at the Co . ) It 's dry , my love , to bear these dreams we seek , And tears at night fit best the treacherous meek.I 've watched my heart , I know the blood-sharp beakRun through it is my own : it mends next week.But wet and heedless rain undoes the national spite , And my corrupted love is yours through rain and night . ( Pause . Lucy Lake shrugs . ) Romantic poets today are all in the Army . p. 26 C. O. Is there anything else you 'd like to say ? LUCY LAKE I 'd like to tell you something . C. O. Fire . LUCY LAKE I was married , General . Three times , years ago . Before I learned what I know about myself now , that I destroy as much as I create . I , too , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have been . A battlefield where he wanted to please me . Where he perished . C. O. I 'm truly sorry . But that 's more like it . It 's your son you 've been talking about here . I understand . LUCY LAKE My son and yours , General . And Mike 's . Ours . ( Pause . She looks around . ) Wait a minute . Has anyone else  --  called here today  --  lost a son  --  or a child  --  in any way ? MISS NOMURA That was the General 's other qualification for his private secretary . BATES Yes . MRS . BATES Our firstborn . MOORE Me , too . And Sergeant Ruggles . C. O. And mine . LUCY LAKE Building a poem . C. O. Thank you very much . Please stay . p. 27 LUCY LAKE Sure . It 's my story , too . C. O. Next . MARTIN Colonel Robertson H. Moore , please . ( Colonel Moore , a thin , healthy , sardonic man , gets up and goes to the witness chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry et cetera , et cetera , and I am Robertson H. Moore , Colonel U.S. Army , Chief of Staff , this Division , and I know exactly why the General got me down on his little list and why I 'm here and what I 'm supposed to say and I 'll be just delighted to say it . C. O. ( Smiling . ) All right , Robie . Go ahead . MOORE A pleasure . I suppose I 'm here to give the minority report , my usual function . I really do n't mean to dance on the man 's grave , but I disagreed with the General on just about every idea he ever had . The only thing I approved was the way he played poker . That he knew how to do . And his archery , of course . But tennis , his mind collapsed every second set . And golf , a game of fidelity and endurance , well , to watch him go to pieces inside a constant framework was to realize that he was a profoundly childish man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , but that 's the freezing truth . C. O. And just what we want you to say , Robie . Go on . p. 28 MOORE You really do n't have to call me " Robie . " Little telegrams are no doubt replacing both of us at this moment : you as executive officer and heir apparent , and me as his ridiculous chief of staff . He appointed me above my time in rank , kept me there against my wishes . He also started calling me " Robie , " with nauseating condescension . C. O. I beg your pardon , Colonel . Your record speaks for itself . You 've been very effective . MOORE Well , I do have my passion for details . Okay . But that is n't why he put me here , over the heads of at least five other officers . He made me his chief of staff because I was a thorn in his side . Due to the chemistry of our personalities , or whatever , I could never lie to him . Or flatter him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought of his decisions , and him . And I disapproved of that more than anything . C. O. You disapproved of a superior officer who allowed you to speak honestly to him ? MOORE Of course ! That is n't the way this Army or any other Army works , and you know it and I know it and he knew it ! As a matter of fact it is n't the way anything works , as everybody knows ! But it was his perverse nature to be  --  well , illustration , please . May I ? I mean , I ca n't be sued for slander , can I ? C. O. You ca n't be sued for slander , Colonel . p. 29 MOORE Fine . That Italian place down the pike , you know , was his favorite off-post restaurant . It 's pretty dependent on the military , so of course the waiters all peed in their britches every time he walked in the door . Okay , fine . But you see , he made them play it the other way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha  --  and pick on him and kid him and bully him a little , you know  --  ho , ho  --  so he could just be one of the boys there . Another good fellow , who belonged , and who 'd get it , just like anybody else , if he stepped out of line . Christ , you half expected him to go out and lay some bricks with them on weekends . Pals , real sports , and it was pathetic to watch him . Sickening . You might have respected the man if he 'd made those flunkies bang their heads on the floor and run their tails off when they brought him his Chateaubriand  --  I think he hated Italian food  --  but watching him play that game with them made me want to vomit . Because that 's what I was ! Honest , outspoken , independent Chief of Staff , nothing . I was his flunky Italian waiter , and I hated it , and him . C. O. All right , Colonel Moore . You 've filed your minority report . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident ? MOORE Well , I fought with him damn near every day , you know , so I hold out to you an embarrassment of riches . But the biggest fight we had , and the gem , was , of course , about the President . p. 30 C. O. President ? MOORE Yes . Of the United States . Yes . C. O. You mean the conference ? MOORE That 's right . That was called off . That 's right . C. O. Well , what about it ? MOORE As everybody knows , on September 15th , the President of the United States announced another Hawaiian conference with representatives of our noble allies in Indochina . Word had come down to the General almost six weeks ago . September 25th . Same old thing . Three days of the President in Hawaii . The General had a fit . C. O. Why ? MOORE Oh , God knows . He was full of little explosions . He bitched and raved about the preparations involved , when he knew the President would never come within thirty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left the paperwork to me . Okay . Five days later , with steam coming out of his ears , he wanted to know why the hell our contingency plans for the arrival in Hawaii of the Commander in Chief were n't smoldering red-hot on his desk . " Because you said the hell with it , " I said . So he hopped all over me , and I hopped and we both hopped . C. O. Why the sudden change in attitude ? Duty ? p. 31 MOORE Hardly . This General 's idea of his military duty was much too sophisticated to include anything as simple as obedience . No , what happened was brand new . Army Headquarters had now scheduled the President , if he felt like it on Saturday night , to visit Schofield Barracks and attend a party at the Officers ' Club . Now , the General thought that was just dandy , so we worked like hell . C. O. But that conference was called off . MOORE Right . Poof . Fini . No Hawaii conference with Indochina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , after all that work , was n't angry . No , he had a strange , dippy , far-off look in his eyes , as if he was dreaming about something impossible , and he said , " Well , we 'll just pretend he came . We 'll have a chair marked RESERVED , pretend he came , and have the party anyway . " And that was that . ( Pause . ) C. O. Interesting . MOORE Yes , is n't it . ( Pause . ) C. O. Well , Colonel , were there any other confrontations you wanted to tell us about ? MOORE You do n't get it , do you ? C. O. Get what , Colonel ? MOORE Never mind . Neither do I. But it 's here , somewhere . Yes , there was another confrontation , of sorts . A day or so later . He came into my office and put a photograph from a newspaper on my desk . Of a Buddhist monk in flames . You saw the gasoline all over him , burning . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you " How about that ? " said the General . I was mad at him . " Barbecued gook , " I said . " So what ? " p. 32 C. O. Colonel Moore ! MOORE Sure I did . He looked at me with profound distaste while I so regarded him . And I thought , to hell with this . " It is a pathetic , useless gesture , " I said . " It is utterly un-American . What does it accomplish ? " And he just looked at me a minute , and then , by God , he slapped me on the back . " You 're absolutely right , " he said . " There has to be something more . There has to be something more . " And he walked out of the room . C. O. What did he mean ? MOORE Who knows ? Maybe what he did . Maybe something we have n't got yet . Anyway , nothing more from me , except I was there Saturday night , and I find most extraordinary the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but the man gave himself exactly what he deserved . C. O. Now , Robie ! MOORE ( Quickly . ) Sorry ! I did n't mean that . ( Pause . ) Oh , hell yes I did . You see ? It 's hard being a United States Army Colonel and an Italian waiter at the same time . Sorry . ( He steps down . ) MARTIN Mrs. Norvel T. Bates , please . ( A woman in her thirties takes the chair . She is very decorous and proper , dressed in a simple ladies suit . ) Mrs. Bates , this inquiry does not require you to answer if you do n't want to . Is that clear ? p. 33 MRS . BATES Yes , sir . MARTIN You are Lorna Ann Bates , married to Sergeant Norvel T. Bates , Headquarters Company , this Division ? MRS . BATES Yes , sir . MARTIN You live here at Schofield , in Army housing , with your husband and three children ? MRS . BATES Yes , sir . MARTIN Mrs. Bates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center ? MRS . BATES Yes , sir . ( Enter Edward Roundhouse , a large man , with a tortured look , wearing casual , comfortable clothes . ) ROUNDHOUSE ( To Mrs. Bates . ) Excuse me . ( To others . ) I am looking for a Captain Martin . MARTIN I am Captain Martin . Please have a seat . I 'll be with you in just a moment . ( He indicates a seat with the others , turns back to Mrs. Bates . Roundhouse sits down . ) Mrs. Bates , is it true that the expansion of the Children 's Day Care Center was the General 's idea ? MRS . BATES Oh , yes . And his wife 's . There was n't much to it until they came . C. O. And brought you . p. 34 MRS . BATES And brought me , yes , sir . MARTIN Mrs. Bates , we have no particular questions here to ask you . By your name the General noted that you would know what to tell us , and that he hoped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BATES Yes , I 'm afraid I do . MARTIN Are you willing , then , to talk about it ? MRS . BATES I guess I have to . If that 's what he wanted . Like I say , everything at the Children 's Center was just wonderful until about three weeks ago . Then they took to coming to the playground together , every day . Something was different about them . I do n't know how to describe it . They just stood there by the fence , watching . Then , about ten days ago , they told me they wanted a child . MARTIN I beg your pardon ? MRS . BATES They said they wanted a child , for the Officer 's Club party . A little boy who could be in a play . MARTIN What was your answer ? MRS . BATES To them ? We have twelve orphans four afternoons a week . Mostly Eurasians , GI fathers , abandoned by both parents . They 're sent to us for the chance to play with other children . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BATES The Orphanage . They said as long as the General and his wife were responsible , of course . So I introduced them to a new little friend we have : Yoshida Robinson . Yoshi is six and a half . C. O. Mrs. Bates , are you telling us that a child , from an orphanage , was being prepared by the General and his wife to take part in an act of violence ? MRS . BATES No , of course they would n't do that ! But  --  Yoshi was supposed to have been there , and was , except for me  --  C. O. Except for you ? MRS . BATES I took Yoshi away from there . When they came out with those masks on , I just took him home . C. O. Be glad you did . MRS . BATES Yes , I am glad I did , but after all they had done for me , I --  MOORE All they did for you , Mrs. Bates , was use you . Ca n't you see that ? MRS . BATES That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did in fact involve you , and through you , a child . Why ? MRS . BATES I do n't know why ! C. O. Mrs. Bates , you prevented what looks like an act of cruelty . p. 36 MRS . BATES Cruel ? Them ? ( She jumps out of her chair , goes to her husband . ) Oh , Norvel . BATES Lorna , go on and say what you want to say . MRS . BATES It ai n't going to do no good . BATES That 's all right . Say it . C. O. Please . ( Mrs. Bates sits in the chair . Sergeant Bates stands a few feet behind her . ) MRS . BATES I met them first outside Miami , at a place called Slim 's , on Route One . Dinah Shore and Jerry Lewis do n't play Slim 's , but I did . That was in the summer of 1962 . I was twenty-six American years old , and I had seen all the ugly , low-down American things a girl like me could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing it , with my Star-Spangled Garter-Belt Guitar : " I 'm Highway born and Highway bred , I 'll be Highway shed , and Highway dead . " I 'll sing it for you sometime . Well , that night , I was just back from the Dominican Republic , where I 'd been for a while , with a real nice man I knew . Brought back an act with a snake , and a few other things . Like smashing customers ' beer bottles in a big towel and rolling around stripping in the broken glass , and not getting cut . Things like that I learned for a living , and playing with snakes , and men . I did n't even see them come in . They were just there , sitting at the piano bar . They were wearing plain old clothes , and just wanted a quiet , relaxing , low-down bar sort of a drink . They could get awful tired , you know , of Officers ' Club parties they had to go to . ( She smiles , fondly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed ; and we sang a lot , and drank a lot , and had the best time together . They even sent me a Christmas card that winter , and we wrote now and then , and about two years ago they wrote asking where I 'd be that summer , and they came to see me . " Hello , " they said . They did n't ask why I was at Freedom Ranch , in Calcutta , California , which is a western-style **27;287;TOOLONG whorehouse , because they knew . I was working , like before . This time I was a masseuse . The house girl , Lorna . " Hello , " they said . " Hello , " I said . " You 're looking fine , " they said . " Oh , yes , " I said , " I 've come up in the world . High society , now . " " Any different ? " they asked . " No , " I said . " Same old Highway trash . Better clothes , and the pimps have Ph.D . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the night , because of so many things , I do n't know , it came to an end for me , and I swallowed everything I had in the medicine cabinet , and went to sleep dreaming of my first husband , my childhood sweetheart I married in Plainfield , Kansas , who when he got mad at me used to fry my brassiere and panties in the oven , and I did sleep , and I was gone away from it all , a free American at last , at peace , and then , oh , God , I woke up in the hospital , with the General and his wife , who 'd got worried about me , and come back that night , and saved my life . " WHY ? " I asked them when I saw them at my bedside . He was dressed right then . It was the first time I 'd seen him in his uniform , looking so -- strong . " Because , Lorna , " he said , " you are a decent woman , and we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what they 'd come to see me about . They got me and Norvel together . Norvel alone with two children to care for , and so , after awhile , we was married . I was saved . Saved from the ditch , from the rock-bottom Highway trash of these United States ! ( Filled with anger and anguish , she stands up . ) And now they 've gone and done what they saved me from ! They have killed themselves , like I tried to do . And everybody wonders why . Well , Jesus Christ on the Cross , I 'll tell you why ! They were too god damned good for their own stinking country , that 's why ! And after fifty years of believing in it , they found that out ! ( She weeps . ) I could have told them that ! They did n't have to die for that , god damn it ! The good life they gave me , they could n't keep for themselves . ( MRS . BATES stares at everyone with defiance . ) Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this country . Everything else I ever seen in it is shit . And the General , except for the husband he found for me , is the only top-to-bottom real man I ever met . My husband and our children , and me , we will be all right . What the General and the Army gave to me , this country can not never take back again . That 's what they mean to me , the General and his wife . ( They go to their seats. ) p. 37 C. O. Next . MARTIN Are you Mr. Roundhouse ? ROUNDHOUSE Roundhouse , Edward E. I was n't coming , but I had a drink and changed my mind . You want me to sit there ? MARTIN Please . ( Roundhouse goes to the chair , stands by it . ) This is an informal and preliminary inquiry , and we thank you for coming . The General left us notes , one saying you were an old and valued friend . That you would have something to tell us . ROUNDHOUSE I want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who nods . Martin gives Roundhouse the note . He reads it , hands it back . ) All right . ( He sits in the witness chair . ) MARTIN You are the owner of a restaurant on the island ? ROUNDHOUSE Several now . Because Michael got me the first one , when he was a Major , stationed briefly here . Its title was Michael 's idea , The Breeze and I. He found it for me , helped me buy into the place , where I washed the dishes and swept the floors until it became a lunch stop for tour buses from Waikiki . Now you must ask me what I did before sweeping the floors of The Breeze and I. C. O. Ask him . MARTIN What did you do before sweeping the floors of The Breeze and I ? p. 38 ROUNDHOUSE I was President of two American universities . After a scholar 's education in classical studies , I graced several advanced faculties , and in due process , bored finally with Socrates and Plato , turned my hand to university administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , in Ohio . In 1951 , President of the University of the Southwest . In 1952 , I began sweeping the floors at The Breeze and I. Follow me ? Never mind , do n't try , just listen . In those lost days of my academic glory , I traveled often , up to my neck in liberal crusades . I met Michael and Sheila in August of 1951 , on the great sweeping porch of the Zen temple that overlooks the Ryuanji Stone Garden , outside Kyoto . They were on a vacation , and we liked each other at once . On my way home , I stayed with them a week , here . We became good friends . I enjoyed their common sense , and respected their intelligent patriotism . They loved to hear all about the great figures in the wide world I journeyed in so freely . Then , time up , I returned home , to give my incoming freshman class my most stirring speech on the advantages of being an American , how lucky we were , of the endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in themselves , and after that , there was a business trip to New York , where in a perfectly respectable hotel bar , over a glass of sherry , I met a young man who thought me equally charming . We adjourned to my room , where he turned out to be cruising for the Vice Squad . He arrested me , that little Benedict Arnold , whose legs , by the way , I can still remember . Those were the days of terror , you recall , when you were probably not merely a homosexual , debauching a poor , innocent policeman , but also most likely a Communist , since both vices were obviously intimately connected . When I got out of jail , what the Hearst papers in Chicago did n't do to me , the faculty and Board of Trustees of the University of the Southwest did . Never mind the honors and the service now , the friendships and the acclaim . As far as my country , which I loved , was concerned  --  just another fairy . ( Pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it killed my mother . Contrary to what you are told , in the Dell edition of Freud , I was very fond of her . But there I was , Mama dead as mutton , and with her my distinguished career in higher education , which had educated in bitterness , alas , only myself . I vaguely supposed I would go to Paris , call myself Sebastian Melmoth , and die there like Oscar Wilde . But my little Major Michael from the summer , who had read about me in the newspapers , called me and said , " Come here . " With Michael 's help I bought my little restaurant by the sea . And as Michael foresaw , a tidal wave of tourists rolled over me . So here I am , better off than ever , a closet queen midwestern college President , turned into a rich , free comber of Somerset Maugham beaches , and boys . I am even a force in the economics of this state now , and believe me , where my sex life is concerned , nobody says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it just for me . We made a deal . In return , I was to make The Breeze and I , in the evenings only , a place for certain soldiers of the Army this young Major loved . " They are good men , too , " Michael said . " The Army should help them . You should help them . " So I put Offenbach and jazz in my jukebox , draped with fiendish cunning fish nets and sailcloth on the walls and ceilings , arranged booths for dignified semi-privacy , and created what Michael had wanted . At noon , of course , I made a killing , the place jammed with Los Angeles tourists and their screaming wives , bedlam but profitable , and at night , under an Oahu moon , something else . ( Pause . ) It 's been that way now twenty years . Major Michael left Schofield for other assignments , passing through now and again . He would call me on my birthday , and at Christmas , like a good son . He wrote me letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Schofield Barracks . Major General Michael , commanding . And once again , as it was in 1952 , one night a week The Breeze and I was closed . Only two men drank the coconut rum , ate the bonito , listed to Offenbach and jazz and looked at the moon . But now it was the war he talked about , and what happened to him in it . About the jealousy of Generals , the panic over their careers , the maneuvers that turned what should have been counsels of war into tangles of vipers . About a President of the United States who so skillfully invited his Generals to lie to him , they finally did n't care when they were lying and when they were n't and neither did he . ( Pause . ) Three nights ago , he told me he understood now , what my country had done to me . " Me , too , " he said , his face like slate . " We are going to lose this war , and rightly . " He looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had someone call me here , " he said . " Is that all right ? " I said yes . He talked briefly to the leader of a Washington protest organization , gave him some information , said , " Use my name , " and hung up . ( Pause . ) And there we were . A disgraced college President and a defeated Army General . " I wo n't see you again , " he said . " But let 's kill the bottle first . " And we did . We embraced . And that was the end of us . I watched him turn , warrior into priest . Religions come and go , conversion remains . I saw it touch him , burning away the soldier he had always been . I loved him . I admired him . In an age where everyone else is innocent , Michael chose the terrible right to be guilty ! p. 39 MARTIN And to betray his country , sir ! ROUNDHOUSE His country , young man , betrayed him ! MARTIN ( Coldly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Sir , that 's the last of the witnesses . C. O. Right . Ladies and gentlemen , the last request the General makes is for a simple review of what they did . Captain Martin . ( Martin gives Bates and Nomura a few pages of a play . ) Mr. Roundhouse , please stay with us . ( Round- house goes back to his seat . ) Sergeant Bates , Miss Nomura , would you please read what you did Saturday night ? And Captain Martin , do we have the masks they wore ? MARTIN Yes , sir . C. O. Let 's see them , please . ( Martin moves the table holding the masks to center . He opens the wooden boxes and sets the masks up against them . They are Noh masks .

You mean the orphan ? LUCY LAKE Yoshida Robinson . Yes . MRS . BATES No ! I took him home . LUCY LAKE But they expected him . MRS . BATES That 's right .

You 're all wrong ! ( The CO stands up . ) C. O. That will do ! ( Pause . ) We have not finished . Is there a medical report ? p. 44 MARTIN Yes . C. O. I want to hear it . MARTIN ( Reading . ) The General 's wife died , unresisting , from the intrusion into her throat of a steel-tipped archer 's arrow , shot from a sixty pound bow . It severed the right carotid artery . She herself grasped the arrow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . The General then took off his mask , drew his Army automatic pistol , placed it against his ear and pulled the trigger .

Sergeant Bates , you have a sealed envelope from the General ! BATES Yes , sir . C. O. Open it and read it . Let him speak for himself .
