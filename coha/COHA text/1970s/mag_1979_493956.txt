White House Watch Upward Bound The Carter claque ? Cabinet members , White House and Carter-Mondale campaign committee staffers , a few congressional supporters and veterans of the 1976 victory , daughter Amy and mother Miss Lillian and sons Chip and Jeffrey ( Jeffrey with his wife ) ? seemed to believe when they stood there in the East Room of the White House moments before 3 p.m. of December 4 , awaiting the entry of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter , that their leader and papa and son and father-in-law was upward bound from his recent lows in every measure of public esteem . They seemed to believe that he had every reason to say , as he did then and again that evening , that he intends to win and will win " reelection as President of the United States of America . " It should have been a gladdening occasion . For reasons connected with but distinct from the reasons he referred to by opening his remarks in the East Room with the words , " I speak to you at a somber time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nearly three years in the presidency this crowd of familiars in the East Room was the only group in the whole country which could be guaranteed to give Carter the applause and the welcome to the 1980 race that he needed for that evening 's TV news . It was saddening for the larger reason that in the East Room and in a disembodied , paid five-minute taped broadcast to what was to have been his Washington " announcement gala " he had to cite his handling of the crisis brought on by the Iranians ' seizure of our Tehran embassy , 52 Americans held there and at the Iranian Foreign Ministry , and the deposed shah 's inconvenient presence in the US , as evidence that he was capable of the leadership that Americans expect from their President . The preludes to the East Room occasion and to what followed it tell something of what 's going on at the Carter White House and in the campaign preliminaries . replied , the President had devoted practically no time to politics and he and Strauss had spent no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ? discussing politics . How much time , Strauss was asked , had Strauss spent on the same subject with Carter 's chief of staff and personal campaign strategist , Hamilton Jordan , in the same three weeks ? Maybe two to three hours a week , Strauss growled . " And that was mostly on the telephone , " Strauss continued . " You ca n't get into his office . " Most of the reporters had n't been able to get near Jordan in that period , either . Jordan was deeply involved with the President 's Iranian and related foreign difficulties . At his best and freest , he is not excessively fond of journalists ' company . It nevertheless did occur to one reporter , listening to Strauss , that Gerald Rafshoon , Carter 's campaign imagist , and Robert Keefe , a political consultant who at Strauss 's instance had been put on part-time contract by the committee , had been seen in and entering and leaving Jordan 's White House office four times during the weeks in question . Jordan excepted ? in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the President 's personal strategist he must be excepted ? political staffers on the White House payroll really have tried within practicable limits to do their campaign work after working hours and during weekends when they in theory are on their own time . They never are really on their own time , of course . After the Carter-Mondale committee was established last March , Jordan and others on the White Housesenior staff met every Tuesday evening at the committee 's temporary office across Lafayette Square from the White House . Frank Moore , a Carter Georgian and the chief White House lobbyist , later had the White House senior staff and senior committee officials to dinner at his house . The dinners have been suspended for a while . They or similar gatherings will soon be resumed . The out-of-hours cover makes some sense in these carping times , but it 's basically silly . Jordan , Anne Wexler , Sarah Weddington , Stuart Eizenstat , Frank Moore , Jack Watson ? just naming a few senior White House assistants ? are paid ( handsomely by my measure ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do it well they of course promote Carter 's chances of renomination and reelection . Those named and many not named here promote his reelection and would be asked to leave if they did n't . They 've been told to hardball it , meaning : help your President 's friends and not his enemies with federal appointments , grants , loans , what-have-you , and at least let the friends and not the enemies announce the largesse . These amateur Carter hardballers ought to call in some of the late John F. Kennedy 's master hardballers , from retirement or from the vasty eternal deep . Most of them are dead or retired or too old anyhow for active campaign duty . Very few are with Senator Teddy . They , in brother Jack 's day , tended to regard Teddy as a young upstart . The kindest remark you hear at and near the Carter White House ( slightly laundered ) is that the CarterMondale campaign operation is all screwed up and that Bob Strauss , the pro of pros , is going to spend some painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I du n no . I summarize what I hear at the White House and at the committee 's new and , at the moment , squalid headquarters in Washington and offer a few tentative answers . Question : is Hamilton Jordan , Carter 's personal campaign planner and strategist , capable of letting Bob Strauss be the overall effective campaign boss that Strauss , being Strauss , insists on being ? General answer from others : that 's the problem . My answer : of course Jordan is capable of it . Strauss would never have taken the committee job if he and Jordan and Carter did n't have a workable understanding about all that stuff . Jordan the young thinker and planner and Strauss the veteran doer are very different people . But they value and like each other and will never tangle to the disadvantage of their man , Jimmy Carter . Question : can Strauss and Jorda-i 's recent White House assistant and gift to the committee , campaign manager Tim Kraft , work together ? A common assumption at the White House is that Kraft would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman Evan Dobelle last September 1 , if Kraft did n't know or expect that Strauss would soon be taking over the committee and him as the permanent chairman . Ominous fact , reflecting as sadly upon Jordan as upon Kraft : Kraft did not know . One gathers that he 'd probably still be at the White House if he had known . Now he talks with committee associates of " a threesome , a Troika " ? Strauss , Jordan , Kraft ? running the campaign . For all his " I 'm the boss " bluster , Strauss is a master of compromise and accommodation . But ? Troika ? That just ai n't Bob Strauss 's style . The committee is loaded with recruits from the White House staff ? administrator Leslie Francis , committee-White House liaison person Diana Rock , and press spokesman Linda Peek , for instance ? whose original loyalty was to Jordan . He did a poor and late job of preparing them for Strauss 's advent . Strauss and they probably will get along , but it makes problems . Question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , when and if Iran and related crises are resolved or at least on the back burner ? Two answers are heard : that even now he " makes the big decisions " and , contrarily , that occasionally he listens for a busy hour or so to Jordan , Strauss , Jody Powell , and others and says , " I 'll let you settle that . " I imagine that some of both is true . Finally , and , if it were not for the preoccupation with Iran and related problems , the uppermost question for now : will Hamilton Jordan 's effectiveness as staff director and campaign strategist be diminished or destroyed by Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti 's decision to ask a special appellate court division to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate charges that Jordan violated federal law by sniffing cocaine ? The obvious answer at this writing is that it has not andprobably will not . My answer is , I pray not . This whole damned thing is unnecessary , outrageous , far beyond the requirements of the relevant law and of simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soon .
