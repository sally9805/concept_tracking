&gt; When the San Francisco board of education announced recently that it no longer had enough money to pay coaches and teachers overtime and had to cancel all after-school sports , drama , music and forensics programs , everybody pitched in to help . The coaches agreed to work one year without overtime pay , and private donations of $70,000 rescued some of the cultural programs . That barely put a dent in the board 's $4 million deficit , but Rock Impresario Bill Graham may yet save the day . He has scheduled a benefit concert of ten major acts ( including the Jefferson Starship , Joan Baez and Santana ) in the city 's 59,626-seat Kezar Stadium . The concert , on March 23 , is called SNACK , Students Need Athletics , Culture and Kicks ; the audience will pay a $5 admission to boogie down from midmorning to dusk . In addition , Graham will sell special SNACK T shirts for $4 each , and all proceeds , after expenses , will go to the schools . <P> &gt; Like many small liberal arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heidelberg College in Tiffin , Ohio , has been having trouble recruiting students . Now , perhaps inspired by the Detroit automakers ' rebate plan to increase sales , <P> Heidelberg 's 39 trustees reached into their own pockets for a $125,000 kitty to underwrite a merit-scholarship plan . Students at or near the top of their high school class will be offered scholarships in the form of reduced tuition charges . For the most deserving , as much as $1,000 will be sliced from the college 's $2,520 tuition . <P> &gt; After the school board in the quiet desert town of Apple Valley , Calif. , voted to fire high school Gym Teacher Lou Zivkovich last fall because he had appeared nude in the centerfold of Playgirl magazine , Zivkovich , 33 , appealed the decision . Last week a state appeals panel admonished him for a " mistake in judgment , " but ruled that he could not be fired . Zivkovich , who received $1,000 plus an expenses-paid weekend in Hawaii for his extracurricular modeling job , called the ruling a " national victory " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Radcliffe admissions last week proposed the inevitable : the two schools should adopt a sex-blind admissions policy " as soon as practical " , meaning next year . Such a policy would probably not immediately alter the current ratio of 2.5 men to every woman , because fewer women apply . Harvard President Derek Bok and Radcliffe President Matina Horner issued a joint statement saying that the major recommendations of the report " seem to us to have great merit . " The proposals still have to be approved by the faculty and trustees . But some Harvard officials and alumni are worried about the long-range consequences . They feel that the proportion of female students will eventually rise , resulting in a smaller number of male students and thus fewer sons of Harvard fathers . Furthermore , men usually contribute more to alumni fund-raising drives than do women .
