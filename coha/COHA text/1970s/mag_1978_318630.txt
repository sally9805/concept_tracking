George Patey is a public relations man whose reach exceeds his grasp , but within his grasp , he has the entire wall against which Al Capone 's gunmen shot down seven rival gangsters on St. Valentine 's Day of 1929 . Patey was in his native Vancouver one morning in 1967 when he heard on the radio , that the famous wall on Chicago 's North Clark Street was about to be demolished . He immediately got on the telephone and , for a price he keeps to himself , bought it . Says he : " They tore down the wall and shipped it to me wrapped like fine china . " Patey 's idea , actually , was to use the wall to create publicity for a Roaring Twenties restaurant he was representing , but the restaurant owner thought the whole idea was , well , perhaps a little too roaring . " So I just kept it , " Patey recalls . He reassembled the wall and showed it at a wax museum , with gun-wielding gangsters shooting each other in front of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went bust . The wall made its last appearance at a Vancouver nightclub , and then Patey dismantled and stored the thing . Now , if any nostalgia enthusiast feels nostalgia for the wall where seven gangsters were shot , George Patey will accept any reasonable offer .
