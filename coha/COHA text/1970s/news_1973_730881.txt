txt Mrs. Marjorie Carr , a housewife from Micanopy , Fla. , watched intently from the audience this week as the historic trial on the controversial cross-Florida barge canal opened here . Although she took no part in the opening-day arguments , nor sat at the plaintiffs ' table , her allies agree that Mrs. Carr has been the biggest single factor in bringing the $200-million canal project to a halt . From a nine-foot-wide office in Gainesville , near the canal site , she has rallied the opposition , recruited research scientists who have donated months of their time , raised tens of thousands of dollars , and compiled extensive files which have proved " invaluable " in the fight . Since 1962 , Mrs. Carr has worked 30 , 40 , and 50-hour weeks ? without pay ? and helped Florida become perhaps the most environmentally conscious state in the Union . Fight for narrow river All this , it might be noted , to save a 60-mile-long river that is so narrow along most of its length that George Washington could have thrown a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven Mrs. Carr so hard against this Corps of Engineers proj-ect ? " It 's the same outrage one feels upon hearing that a man took a hammer and wrecked the Pieta , " she says . The canal , about one-fourth complete before being halted by President Nixon in 1971 , would have inundated about half the entire length of the Oklawaha River under impounded water needed to operate the canal . Thousands of acres of cypress , tupelo , and ash swamplands rich in wildlife would have been destroyed . " It should be saved because it is a beautiful , unique river , " Mrs. Carr explained over a salad during the court 's noontime break . " Man recognizes the worth of man 's work , " she continued . " More and more he is recognizing the value of the works of nature . We are in a transitional change so far as our ethics are concerned .

Its effort , not counting legal expenses for the current trial , has cost $50,000 , Mrs. Carr estimates . FDE , though , is n't paying the latest legal expenses . Around the table of lawyers here opposing the canal are those from the Environmental Defense Fund ( " They wanted to set a precedent with this case . " Mrs. Carr says ) and the U.S. Department of Justice . Government lawyers are defending the President 's right to cut off funds for the canal , on which the corps already had spent $56 million . " We 're the good bad guys in this case , " says one justice attorney . If FDE needed to carry the legal burden alone , however , it probably could have done it , based on Its past record . And Mrs. Carr 's would have been at the forefront of that effort .

Dr. Paul Roberts , assistant professor of economics at the University of Florida , says enthusiastically of Mrs. Carr : " She has changed my career . " Dr. Roberts , who formerly taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , says Mrs. Carr persuaded him to use computers of analyze the corps ' economic justifications for the canal . He has devoted four years of his spare time to that study and subsequent follow-ups  --  and also has become involved as a specialist in 10 other environmental cases across the country .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . It can be an ad hoc group , as ours was , " she says . " Then find out exactly ? exactly ? what is going to happen . This was very difficult in this case of the Oklawaha Valley . The corps said not much was going to happen . . .. But find out what they are going to build , investigate carefully . That is , they may say they will flood the trees , but it will not kill them . The corps would't lie and say they were n't going to flood ; but they do n't know the effect . " Then find out what 's available in the law . . . to protect this . " You must stick meticulously to the truth . If it 's a fact , say it 's a fact ; if it 's an opinion , say it 's an opinion  --  and stick to this principle . " We 've never dealt with personalities .. . . Credibility stressed " Then you need to get people informed . You must develop a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Our files always have been open to the public , and particularly to the press . " As few as three could start such an effort .. . . " I think you need an honest budget for something . If you 're a new group , get half the contributions in big amounts ? $300 or more . " As the years went by , and the fight became more complicated , Mrs. Carr persuaded more and more research scientists to join the effort and lend their skills to save the Oklawaha . Mrs. Carr expresses optimism about the outcome of this month 's trial , which is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal . Now she looks forward to what may be the next major environmental collision in Florida : offshore drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico . Exxon , Texaco , and Gulf ? take heed .
