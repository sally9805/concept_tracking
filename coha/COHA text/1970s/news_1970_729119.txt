txt The Army announced today detailed plans to destroy its biological and toxic weapons in accordance with pledges made by President Nixon . But the United States will continue research on defenses against weapons of this kind . The germ warfare stocks now stored at four arsenals it the United States , will be de ? stroyed at a cost of $12.2-mil. lion as soon as the plans have been finally approved by all interested Federal , state and local agencies . The work will probably begin early next year and take 12 months . Primary emphasis in disposing of these materials will be placed on " safety and security rather than cost - or time , " Lieut . Col. Gerald -G . Watson of Kilgore , Tex. , the officer in charge of the destruction program , said today . He emphasized that the materials would not be moved but destroyed where they are now stored . Other officers said that the Army was anxious to avoid public anxiety of the kind that occurred last March when the Army planned to ship nerve gas from Okinawa to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army finally to choose Johnston Island in the Pacific as a storage place . ? Made Since 1962 Colonel Watson said the United States had been making biological weapons - since 1943 but that the supplies now to be . destroyed . were manufactured from 1962 to 1969 , at a total cost of $726-million . Supplies produced before 1962 have been destroyed from time , to time as they became obsolete . Most of the supplies to , : be disposed of are for " use against human beings and are stored at the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arlicenses . The rest , for use against enemy crops , are at Fort Detrick , near Baltimore ; Rocky Mountain Arsenal , Denver , and Beale Air Force Base , Marysville , Calif . ' The program will take 48 weeks at Pine Bluff , 26 weeks at Fort Detrick , 52 weeks at Rock Mountain Arsenal and 12 weeks at Beale . In the operation 298 persons will be employed . Both biological materials and toxins are to be destroyed . Biological materials are living organisms whereas toxins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not act immediately and might get out of hand  --  if , for instance , birds carried a contagion back to an attacking country  --  toxins are more immediately potent . And toxins would . affect only those directly exposed . The toxins include botulin , the substance that poisons consumers of improperly canned vegetables by attacking the ? nervous system . It can paralyze the breathing muscle . Colonel Watson declined to disclose either the quantity or the nature of the supplies to be destroyed . It was reliably reported in . October of last year , however , that the Army had produced more than 20 , - 000 bullets containing botulin . There is no evidence that they were ever used . Not Chemical Weapon President Nixon renounced the " manufacture and use of biological and bacteriological weapons on Nov. 25 of last year , and on Feb. 14 of this yead he extended the repection to toxins . The United States has , however , not renounced the manufacture or use of chemical weapons , including various kinds of gas and defoliants . But it is American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use gas . Official statements , however , have added that the United States reserved the right to use riot control gases , by which tear gas is meant . A protocol banning the use of chemical as well as biological weapons was adopted in Geneva in 1925 . It was approved by the White House and sent ' to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , where it remained until it was returned to the White House in 1947 . Last August , in response to renewed international pressures , the White House ? again submitted this protocol to the Senate , but the Foreign Relations Committee has not called for hearings . The ' memorandum submitting ' the , protocol added that the United States did not consider tear gas as a gas that must be banned . The elaborate method by which biological materials will be destroyed at Pine Bluff was described by Colonel Watson today . The building in which the work is done is kept at low pressures so that any leaks will seep into rather than out of its shell , and exhausts from the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat Sterilizing Some conception of the precautions taken is conveyed by the following passage in his description of the destruction process : " In the hold tanks the material will be sterilized by heating with steam to 280 degrees Fahrenheit and held at this temperature for three hours . After cooling , samples will be removed , taken to the laboratory and extensively tested to verify beyond any question that the , agent has been destroyed . After verification , the harmless material will be inoculated with sewage organisms and biodegraded in a manner similar to the treatment of domestic sanitary sewage . " The material is sterilized again at 280 degrees Fahrenheit for three hours . Samples will again be drawn and tested to verify there are no living organisms present . After this verification-the liquid will be placed in drums and sterilized in an autoclave and moved out of the plant . The waste will then be transported to a small commercial sewage treatment facility near the plant where it will be further bio-degraded . " The harmless liquid waste Will be discharged to a sealed covered evaporation pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry material will then be collected and spread on the arsenal property adjacent to the plant . It will be diced into the soil to a depth of about four inches . and grass planted as a cover crop . '
