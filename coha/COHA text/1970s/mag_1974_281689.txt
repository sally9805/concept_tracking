In the U.S. today many public men must sympathize with Satan in Milton 's Paradise Lost , who hears " On all sides , from innumerable tongues/ A dismal universal hiss , the sound/ Of public scorn . " It is a period in which reputations seem extraordinarily vulnerable , in which everyone 's bank of prestige faces a run . <P> Cases vary widely . State and local officials are being investigated and indicted in unprecedented numbers . The record of a durable doer like New York 's Robert Moses is debunked . The awesome images of Nelson Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger have been leaked on with acid . The public 's approval of Presidents , at least as measured by opinion polls , fluctuates wildly . <P> Part of the trend stems from wide spread disillusionment over Viet Nam , part from the multifarious crimes of Watergate that ruined so many reputations and deepened public distrust . Now there is a new and spreading skepticism about the pronouncements of the mighty , a new impatience with politics as usual , a new eagerness to challenge practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards can have practical benefits . Last week , for instance , President Ford signed a long overdue campaign-financing reform bill . The voters of California have approved a stringent anticorruption measure . But there is also a tendency to condemn prematurely and to burn today 's leaders with the laser of hindsight . It is a particularly painful period both for public leaders and for a people in need of leaders who merit confidence .
