There are small groups such as the South Coast Repertory , Inc. , of Costa Mesa , Calif. , which will get $30,000 , and large consortiums of groups banded together to broaden their fund-raising appeal .

" We 've grown to the point where we can do things on a national scale , but this is a tremendous step . It will help us expand further without taxing energies to the breaking point " The challenge-grant program was approved last year by Congress , with White House backing .
