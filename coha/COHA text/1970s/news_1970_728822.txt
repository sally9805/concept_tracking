txt After years of obscurity black power has suddenly become a potentially powerful political force in Britain . Its numbers are still small , but race experts see in recent police-black power confrontations a deepening malaise in British race relations and a springboard for increased black-power activity . Two or three years ago , black power was scarcely known . Now , following an ugly police-black power confrontation in which 17 policemen were hurt and 18 demonstrators remanded on bail , it is the subject of close and urgent government scrutiny . At a time when integration appears to make no forward advancement , black power 's progress is attributable specifically to these factors : ? Organizationally , the fragmented and brittle British Black Power Alliance has recently solidified itself into a relatively cohesive alliance . ? Ideologically , it is spawned , so race experts say , on three fertile breeding grounds . These are lack of equal job opportunities for British-born colored youths , breakdown in police-colored community relations ? a point vigorously disputed by the police ? and the powerful presence of Enoch Powell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strands of black nationalism and Marxist influence running through practically all of them but with the mix varying in each case . The American experience ? reflected in vocabulary , style , and method ? does much to cement the alliance . Consequently those involved in race relations believe there is a serious danger that the police tend to think the problem is one of outside American agitation rather than internal discontent ? though nobody denies outside influence has played its part . * Please turn to Faze 4 Keystone Black customers vie with whites in London market *Black power bubbles in British caldron // In terms of actual membership , black-power ranks are sparse  --  thought by some to have only a few hundred followers . Other estimates put the figure at several thousand . Those close to the movement argue that the figures are either meaningless or deceptive . Michael Abdul Malik ( Michael X ) , Black Muslim leader , president of the Racial Adjustment Action Society , and Britain 's most visible black-power leader , totally dismisses numbers in assessing the strength of the movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization .

For Dipak Nandy , director of the Runnymede Trust and an authority on British race relations , figures gives no hint of black power 's latent appeal . He believes that , unlike two years ago , black power " is beginning to speak to the conditions of a lot of black people in this country . " That a number of colored people in Britain today are attracted to black power without admittedly giving it their active support is critical for the country 's future race relations . Police are confident that the vast majority of colored people in Britain totally reject the concept of black power ( colored onlookers have jeered its supporters ) and are ashamed by its behavior to the police . The police themselves widely believe there also is a strong unconscious alliance between colored people and whites against black extremism . Supposition is suspect Mr. Nandy regards this as an extremely dangerous supposition .

It does n't give me any pleasure to say it but the evidence is unmistakable . " Black power in Britain , relatively quiescent until this year , grabbed the headlines last week when its supporters and the police clashed violently in the Paddington-Notting Hill area of west London . A police drug raid on a " soul food " restaurant , noted as a rendezvous for black-power supporters , sparked the demonstration . The violent clash , plus the impact of other provocative factors , such as strident demands to raid police stations to release black detainees , means that the police are to open up their dossiers on black-power agitation to the Home Office . Yet as recently as early 1969 that definitive work on race relations in Britain  --  the 756-page " Color and Citizenship " by E. J. B.
