With advice from their state medical society , which has set up a $500,000 malpractice war chest , four Illinois physicians have filed suits of their own against patients and their lawyers who are suing them . <P> One of the cases involves Dr. Eugene R. Balthazar , the founder of a highly regarded free clinic in Aurora , Ill . ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) , who was accused of malpractice by a woman treated for a facial malignancy .

Though the cases have yet to be tried , the doctor 's attorney , Ellis Rubin , thinks that they have already had a chastening effect in the area . " Suddenly , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
