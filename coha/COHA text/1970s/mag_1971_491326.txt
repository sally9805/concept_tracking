OWE AND , 2717ZN : TWO MENDOWETHOUT OliNGLE THOUGHT By ARON COOPEA No one who has watched any scene they made during their 18 years as a team could doubt that Laurel and Hardy operated as two minds without a single thought . Who else but pencil-necked Stan Laurel could saunter up to a soda fountain and innocently ask for " mustachio " ice cream ? Who else but fat , pompous Oliver Hardy could break the icy silence with a lady on a stagecoach by observing , amid blushes and tie-twiddles , " Awful lot of weather we 're having . .. " ? Together , they bounce and blunder off each other to set new standards for mindlessness . Like the time Stan takes 011ie 's temperature . Shoving a huge " thermometer " in the ( typically ) open mouth , Stan pulls it out and shakes it . Confusion and silence . " Well ? " says 011ie . After a long double-take , Stan shrugs and blurts . " Wet and Windy . " " Yoouu IDIOT ! " 011ie booms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were an elegant mismatch . Skinny Stan Laurel , wearing his hair in a vertical shock mop , his eyes fixed in a vacant stare , played the well-meaning dimwit . Oliver Hardy , rotund , with greasy bangs and a slow-burn stare , affected normality . 011ie usually got the worst of it and always blamed his pal . But he went through life in a mental fog every bit as impenetrable as Stan 's ; he just never realized it . These gentle buffoons are dead now . Their best movies were made over 30 years ago . Yet their popularity has never been greater than it is today . Nostalgia ? Maybe ? but a harmless belly laugh needs no explanation , no excuse . Laurel and Hardy were simply two very funny people who never realized that life was supposed to be tragic and complex . They were children with a knack for disaster no matter how uncomplicated the task that confronted them . They lost every round and came back . Hal Roach created the Laurel and Hardy team in 1927 . Stanley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally settled as a writer and director for Roach . Oliver , the son of a Georgia lawyer , had mainly been a " heavy " in supporting roles . Their teaming was as much accident as anything else . As Laurel and Hardy , they made their best films during their 13 years under Roach . " Both Stan and Babe ( 011ie 's nickname ) were fine actors , " recalls 79-year-old Roach . " They had to be . A good comedian is harder to find than a good dramatic actor because of the timing involved . " Roach and the boys had good times as well as notorious differences during the years of filming . On the set of Leave ' Em Laughing , Stan recalled , " we actually had to stop shooting because we were laughing so muck " In almost 100 films as a team , Laurel and Hardy were everything from mousetrap salesmen in Switzerland to French Foreign Legionnaires . Mostly they played common people ? peddlers , carpenters , dog-lovers ( evicted with their hound , Laughing Gravy ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on chaos . Plot was just a rumor . As soon as you sat down to the familiar " da-doo dee-doo " of the " Cuckoo Song , " you knew what to expect . Catastrophe , pure and simple . Even some sight gags were equally predictable : 011ie 's tie-twiddle and camera-stare ; Stan 's flip-flop walk , crying routine , and vacant expression . Still , they made people laugh . And laugh . And laugh . If their present popularity is a revival , it has been going on since their first days on the silent screen . During World War II , Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin had private screenings of their films . Marshall Tito does the same today . In 1956 , poet Dylan Thomas shocked a group of experimental film converts by defining poetry in film as " a scene in which Laurel pushed Hardy down the stairs .... " In 1953 , they docked in Cobh , Ireland , while on tour . Their film careers over , their best movies more than a decade gone , Stan and 011ie could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles and a huge crowd cheering madly on the docks . Stan recalled that day to biographer John McCabe in Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy . " You 'd think people would forget , but they do n't .... We just could n't understand what it was all about . And then something happened that I can never forget . All the church bells in Cobh started to ring out our theme song , " The Cuckoo Song , " and Babe looked at me , and we cried . Maybe people loved us and our pictures because we put so much love into them . 1 do n't know . I 'll never forget that day . Never . " Nor will their fans forget them . One young soldier stationed at Ft . Leavenworth sold a pint of blood to gain the price of a ticket to a Laurel and Hardy double feature in Kansas City . Probably the high-water mark was established by a Peace Corps volunteer stationed in Africa who hitchhiked 250 miles to Nairobi to catch a half-hour L &H; short . Such devotion was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCabe helped found " Sons of the Desert , " the official L &H; buff club . ( " A buff types his letters ; a fan writes on lined yellow paper , " said McCabe . ) Shortly before he died in 1965 , Stan himselfpenned their " **25;3176;TOOLONG Thought " motto . The club got its name from the title of a 1934 L &H; movie . In the film , Stan and 011ie belong to a fraternal organization called " Sons of the Desert. ? They swear an oath to the Exalted Ruler ( the " Exhausted Ruler " to Stan ) to attend the annual convention in Chicago . The wives say no dice ; the boys cook up a typical scheme . 011ie pretends to get sick , and Stan calls in a veterinarian ( " But 011ie , I did n't think his religion had anything to do with it . " ) who prescribes a quiet rest in Honolulu . The boys go to Chicago instead , whoop it up , and head for home . Meanwhile , the ship supposedly bringing them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they happen to see their lost husbands in a newsreel with h footage of the convention . The boys try to lie their way out . " We got caught in this terrible storm , " 011ie intones . " Yes , " Stan volunteers , " we floundered in a typhoid . We dove overboard just as the ship was going down for the third time . " But Stan finally breaksinto tears and his wile . I orgives him . 011ie 's wife is downright uncharitable . The film ends with Stan , in silk kimono , cigar in hand , peering down at 011ie amid a mound of broken dishes , advising : " Honesty is the best politics . " The buff club adopted more than the name of their film counterparts . The bombast of the " Exhausted Ruler " and the secret rituals provide the buffs with a spoofing framework , a " half-assed dignity " as Stan put it to McCabe . The Sons of the Desert have 23 " tents " ( chapters ) across the country now . Each tent takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " Tit for Tat " tent of Toronto . Members include bank presidents , doctors , lawyers , factory workers . and performers like Dick Van Dyke and Soupy Sales . Of them all , the newest tent is the most unusual . It started with a letter to Hal Stanton , a member of the Sons and a broadcaster for " The Wonderful World of Laurel and Hardy " on station WWLP in Springfield . Massachusetts . The touching letter began , " I am an inmate at the Somers prison .... In here where there is little comedy and constant pressure , it is great to see a little clean American humor as only these two can present it thank you for bringing Laurel and Hardy to me and the rest of the fellas here who watch your show , and there are quite a few . We need to smile too with the rest of the world , an hour of comedy by these two men goes a long way in here where smiles are rare . " Eventually , this letter resulted in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somers , a maximum security prison with 900 inmates . The tent has a " fluctuating membership , " according to the Sons , but currently there are 153 members . On the West Coast , Larry Byrd , vice-sheik ( in charge of vice ) of the " Way Out West " tent in Los Angeles , edits and publishes Pratfall , a small periodical devoted to Laurel and Hardy . Byrd does all the work in his Van Nuys home as a labor of love since he rarely breaks even with an issue . He has had inquiries from buffs in the Netherlands , England , and even Poland who want to distribute Pratfall in their countries . Byrd and the " Way Out West " members do their best to circulate the magazine with their tiny budget . Besides Pratfall and the Sons of the Desert and other private buffery , the popularity of Laurel and Hardy is maintained on two commercial fronts . First , they can be seen weekly on TV networks in virtually every major city in the nation . In New York , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WF LD ; and in Los Angeles , on KTTV , film distribution being handled by the Walter Reade organization of New York . Second , a flood of products ? from L &H; jams to T-shirts ? are being distributed by George Garabedian , a licensing agent for Richard Feiner &; Co. , which bought merchandising rights from Hal Roach Studios in 1969 . When the commercialization and revival cult die down , Stan and 011ie will still be popular among those who have always loved them . Stan could n't have been more wrong when he wept upon learning of 011ie 's death in 1957 , saying : " That ends the history of Laurel and Hardy . "
