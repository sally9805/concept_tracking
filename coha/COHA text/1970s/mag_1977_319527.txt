Now that the President is more concerned with the global village , the real Clinton has stood up . Early last week the genuine town meeting was scheduled to discuss , among other items , Clinton 's $6.5 million budget . The attendance : 268 . Police beat the streets in an effort to flush out enough folks to reach the total of 300 needed for a quorum . No luck . <P> Lamented Selectman Martin H. MacNamara : " Apathy has crawled back into the system . " Said local P.T.A . Representative Edward Mclntyre : " We should have invited Billy Carter . " But for at least one Clintonian , what loomed largest was a possible reproach from on high . Said he : " I just hope Jimmy does n't find out . " On Thursday Clinton tried again , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warning that " TV will be there even if you 're not . "
