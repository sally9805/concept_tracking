Racing is not a sport with Julius Rudel . It is practically a way of life . Briefcase clutched in one hand , a tuxedo in a plastic bag slung over his arm for use later that night , he hurried out of his apartment on Manhattan 's upper West Side one recent midday and jumped into a worn 1966 Chevy . A morning full of conferences had left him just ten minutes to get to a dress rehearsal of a new production of Carmen at Lincoln Center , 20 blocks south . " If we take the proper turns , we 'll make all the lights without stopping once , " he explained . " The ride should take no more than four minutes . " <P> Actually it took five , but promptly at one o'clock Rudel was at the podium raising his baton-or , rather , a thin white knitting needle-to start the Carmen overture . His instructions to the orchestra were brief and to the point : " Trumpets , did n't you notice I slowed down ? " Politely but firmly he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baritone in mid-phrase . " He remained unperturbed when a voice from backstage implored : " Wait , Julius , wait . Don Jos 's costume has just fallen apart . " The singer finally appeared onstage clutching uncertainly at his trousers . " Jesus Christ , Julius , " he wailed , " I 'm losing my pants and I 've got nothing on underneath . " Deadpanned Rudel : " Now you 've got it made . " <P> That kind of cool is indispensable for Rudel as he pursues one of the busiest schedules in the music world . After 14 years as director and chief conductor of the New York City Opera , Rudel is now also music director of Washington 's new John F. Kennedy Center . As if that were not work enough , he is also consultant to the Wolf Trap Farm summer festival in Vienna , Va. , and is music director of both the Cincinnati May Festival and the elegant , intimate Caramoor summer festival in New York 's Westchester County . <P> Economist 's Talent . Gray-haired but athletic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , an economist 's talent for budget balancing and a gift for inspiring loyalty in colleagues . As a conductor-the job he likes best-Rudel is almost wholly devoid of showy theatricality ; yet his taste , musicianship and sense of rhythm are faultless , and he is at home in an unusually wide variety of styles . Says Soprano Beverly Sills : " I think he is one of the greatest opera conductors in the world . " <P> Rudel frequently conducts opera six nights in a row , which is a little like pitching six baseball games back to back . " Obviously , there is something driving me , " he admits . " I do n't know what it is , and I do n't want to know . " Rudel came to the U.S. in 1938 as a teen-age refugee from Vienna . Studying music on scholarships at settlement schools and later at Manhattan 's Mannes College , he supported himself by working part time in a button-dyeing factory . After graduation he became assistant conductor at Mannes at a salary of $35 a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have enough money to go to work , " remembers his wife Rita . A neuropsychologist , she raised their two daughters ( now married ) and Son Anthony , 14 , more or less on the side , while going to college and pursuing her own career .
