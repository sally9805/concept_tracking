With a broom sticking out of the rear window of his green Ford , David L. Boren drove across Oklahoma , promising to reform the government and " sweep the Old Guard " out of office if he were elected Governor . At the start of his campaign , Boren , 33 , was scarcely known outside Oklahoma Baptist University , where he teaches government , and the state capitol , where he is a four-term representative . But his message caught on , and " Boren Broom Brigades " sprang up all over the state . Last week they swept the chubby , soft-spoken Rhodes scholar to a decisive win over Congressman Clem R. McSpadden , 48 , in the Democratic primary runoff . <P> The victory was all the more remarkable because of Boren 's unorthodox campaign tactics . He made little effort to court the bloc votes of teachers , ranchers and labor that are traditionally a determining factor in Oklahoma elections , and spurned all contributions from groups and organizations . Said he : " I just want to be indebted to the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma voters , weary of scandal not only in Washington but also in Oklahoma City , where incumbent Governor David Hall ( who was eliminated in the primary ) faces probable indictment by a federal grand jury investigating kickbacks in the awarding of state contracts . <P> Boren is the favorite to win in November , when he will face Republican State Senator James Inhofe , 39 , a conservative insurance executive . Before the August primary , when his close friend Boren was considered a distant dark horse , Inhofe praised him as the best Democratic candidate .
