Son of 60 Minutes hits CBS <P> After undermining the taste , intelligence and dental hygiene of American children every Saturday morning for a generation , commercial television may have discovered a way to make amends : news for kids . In recent years the networks have been experimenting with various brief news updates and didactic entertainment specials for younger viewers. * But so far , TV has produced nothing for children quite so grown up as CBS 's newborn 30 Minutes . <P> As the name implies , the show is a junior version of the network 's hard-punching weekly magazine-format program , 60 Minutes .
