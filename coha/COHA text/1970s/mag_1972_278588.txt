Italy last week seemed to be heading toward a political fate that most people did not want but no one seemed able to avoid : the dissolution of Parliament and a general election a year ahead of schedule . If that were to hap- ! pen , it might well mean the demise of the quarrelsome , cumbersome and increasingly ineptcenter-left coalition that has governed the country for the past ten years . <P> The keystone of the coalition is the Christian Democratic Party-Italy 's largest-which has dominated 27 consecutive governments since 1945 . For the past decade , the party 's strategy has been to try to hold power with the help of the Social Democrats and the farther left Socialists in order to keep the Communists , the nation 's second largest political organization , out of office . <P> During the past year , though , the Christian Democrats have suddenly found their right flank exposed . In last June 's local elections , the Neo-Fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano made substantial gains by preaching the need for more law-and-order . Now the M.S.I , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a controversial divorce law that Parliament passed in 1970 . In order to keep the vote of Italy 's conservative Catholics , the Christian Democrats can not openly oppose the referendum-but a waffling stance threatens their alliance with the Socialists , who are adamantly opposed to repeal of the law . <P> A more immediate cause of Christian Democratic worries was the defection from the coalition of another party - the slightly left-of-center Republicans , who withdrew last month to protest inflationary government spending . When the Republicans pulled out , Premier Emilio Colombo resigned from office , and Italy since then has been without effective government . President Giovanni Leone asked Colombo to try to form a new one . When he finally admitted failure , Leone turned to yet another Christian Democrat , Giulio Andreotti , the party 's floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies . <P> At week 's end Andreotti was holding summit talks with other leaders and tinkering with alternatives . The Christian Democrats still wanted another coalition . Even if Andreotti succeeded in forming one , no one gave such a government much chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most plausible alternative is that the Christian Democrats , who do not have a clear majority in the Chamber , might try to carry on as a one-party monocolore government which could be brought down at any time . That would simply be the next step toward dissolving Parliament and sending Italians to the polling booths .
