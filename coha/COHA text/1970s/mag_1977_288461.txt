THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE <P> Directed by Luis Buuel <P> Screenplay by Luis Buuel with <P> Jean-Claude Carrire <P> Mathieu ( Fernando Rey ) is an elegant middle-aged Spaniard who likes brandy and cigars , expensive suits and an occasional pretty woman . He is an unflappable sort-but since he is the hero of a Luis Buuel film , his poise is soon put to extraordinary tests . Terrorists , for no discernible reason , begin to blow up cars in his tranquil Seville neighborhood . A waiter at his favorite restaurant serves him a martini containing a huge fly . His butler , ordinarily a paragon of civility , starts to give him Up . Somehow Mathieu remains untouched by all these shenanigans , but then he falls in love with Conchita , a ravishing young virgin . Though Conchita professes to adore Mathieu with an ardor equal to his own , she will not go to bed with him-and will not say why . Such torture is more than even Mathieu can take : slowly he surrenders to the chaos that presses in on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desire is Buuel 's free-flowing meditation on Mathieu 's fall from bourgeois grace , and like so many films by this great surrealist director , it is art of the most subversive kind . Buuel wants the audience to see the world as he ultimately forces Mathieu to see it-as an irrational state where logic is a worthless tool . In Obscure Object the director never bothers to explain Conchita 's stubborn celibacy or any of his story 's other absurdities , for he does not believe that any explanations exist . In Buuel 's view , life 's visible events are random and misleading ; the sooner we learn to accept the meaninglessness of reality , the sooner we will begin to understand the buried psychological truths that reality tends to disguise . <P> This is why , in Obscure Object , Buuel pulls the fiendish stunt of casting two actresses as Conchita , and then proceeds to interchange them at whim . It is his way of saying that the movie 's subject is Mathieu 's obsessive desire rather than the ' obscure object " that brings it about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all designed to pull the rug out from under civilization as we know it . Buuel casts a dwarf as a professor of psychology and dreams up a clerical terrorist group called the Revolutionary Army of the Infant Jesus . When the two Conchitas implore Mathieu to respect their virginity , they are sometimes dressed in racy undergarments that even Frederick 's of Hollywood might consider too much . <P> For all the anarchy of Bu@#241 ; uel 's vision , there is nothing chaotic about his filmmaking style . At 77 , he is in such fluid touch with his ' medium that he seems incapable of staging an awkward shot . The movie appears to flow directly from his subconscious , just as surrealist art is meant to do . Fernando Rey , a veteran of a decade of Buuel films , finds as much baroque humor in his many bouts with coitus interruptus as he did in the unfinished eating scenes of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie .
