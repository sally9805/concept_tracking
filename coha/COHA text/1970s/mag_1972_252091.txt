THE airline industry is like the little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead . When the industry is good , it is very , very good ; but when it is bad it is horrid . After nearly two years of being absolutely awful , largely because the U.S. economy was sluggish , the highly cyclical air-travel business appears headed for good times once again . <P> The Civil Aeronautics Board is forecasting pretax profits of up to $350 million for the eleven domestic trunk lines this year , up from last year 's $25 million and 1970 's $85 million loss . Executives of six U.S. airlines that either lost money or made only minor profits last year ( American , Eastern , National , Northeast , Pan Am and TWA ) expect to do much better in 1972 . As CAB Chairman Secor Browne says , " the airlines have essentially turned the corner . " <P> Not only is passenger traffic running 3.2% ahead of 1970 , but the lines have laid off some 10,000 employees , deferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 flights from their schedules , and otherwise cut operating costs to the leanest levels in years . The CAB last April granted the trunks a 6% fare increase and is expected to permit another 3% rise this spring . The wage controls of Phase II will probably help hold down the industry 's labor costs , which have risen at least 43% per employee since 1966 and account for nearly half of all airline overhead . <P> Of all the flights toward recovery , TWA 's has been one of the most dramatic . The line lost $64 million in 1970 and did little better than break even last year . Wall Street analysts figure that TWA will earn $30 million this year . TWA carried out an aggressive cost-cutting program , laying off 4,000 employees and dropping a number of minor passenger services-like eyeshades on night flights . No further economy moves have been announced , but TWA Chairman Charles Tillinghast cautions that " both TWA and the industry are still far from out of the woods . " <P> Mating Season . American Airlines , which lost $26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The company could earn $36 million this year . One factor in the recovery is President George Spater 's successful campaign to focus on the growing leisure market by picking up routes to Hawaii , the South Pacific and the Caribbean . Pan Am lost $48 million in 1970 , and its future looked so bleak last year that the CAB 's Browne raised the possibility of some kind of federal assistance for the line . Now Wall Street analysts figure that Pan Am will break even this year and turn a substantial profit in 1973 . United Air Lines reduced its losses from $41 million in 1970 to about $3,000,000 last year . " I think there will be a turnaround for us in 1972 , " says U.A.L. President Edward Carlson .
