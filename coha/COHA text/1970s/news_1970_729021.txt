txt Dr. Frederick R. Franke of Pittsburgh and his family of five often drive their 1969 Ford Country Squire station wagon over " washboard " roads in the country . With every bounce , he seriously wonders whether one of his front wheels may suddenly collapse . It 's happened to other Fords of the same vintage . Dr. Franke wrote to the manufacturer but was assured his car had no defect , if driven under " normal " conditions . Now a growing number of consumer advocates , led by Ralph Nader and the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety ( manned by some of Mr. Nader 's young colleagues ) charge that the incident illustrates a grave problem . They argue that neither the industry , nor its watchdog , the federal government , begings to go far enough on ordering recalls . They say that " relative danger " is not a relevant factor when lives are at stake . They say the government has failed to take full advantage of its power ( admittedly limited ) and knowledge . Certainly the auto industry has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the Department of Transportation began keeping tally , recall notices have been mailed to more than 14 million car owners in the United States . Nonetheless , criticism continues ? with the critics pointing the finger at the government particularly in the Ford case . Dr. Franke 's car happens to have the same basic lower control arm , holding the front wheels in place , as the 85,000 police cars recalled by Ford at the urging of the National Highway Safety Bureau ( NHSB ) last August . So do 4 million other privately owned Fords manufactured between 1965 and 1969 . A five-month study by the safety bureau found that of 90 verified control-arm failures on cars produced between 1967 and 1969 , some 53 were on police pursuit cars . Both the government and manufacturer concluded that police cars were the most prone to the trouble . Most failures had occurred , they said , under conditions of " extreme abuse " at high speeds , and with high mileage accumulated on the speedometer . However , there is growing evidence that there is more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation ( DOT ) bulletin issued in mid-October warns owners of 18 models of Fords manufactured between 1965 and 1969 that under certain conditions they just might experience control-arm failures , and it solicits any experiences motorists would care to offer . // By R. Norman Matheny , staff photographer Defects missed . . . on the assembly line have motorists heating up and safety advocates pushing for more recalls .. *Nader raps auto industry for infrequency of recalls // ? But the guarded announcement soothes owners with comforting statistics ? their odds for difficulty are less than 1 in 100,000  --  and the manufacturer is not asked to launch any massive recall , let alone even notify those who bought the cars that they might have trouble . Mr. Nader and the center charge that the NHSB has relied almost exclusively on Ford testing data for its technical conclusions . Alarming result noted They say the results of independent testing , such as that contracted for by NHSB with private firms and that done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , are far more alarming than consumers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with low mileages and driven at low speed are not immune from control-arm failure . The Center for Auto Safety argues thti more models are involved than are listed on the DOT bulletin ( just this month the department conceded this point in a letter to Lowell Dodge who heads the center ) and that all autos concerned ought to be recalled . The Ford case is no isolated phenomenon . The Nader forces counted it a significant victory this month when the National Safety Bureau capped two years of dodging such an issue by urging General Motors to notify owners of 150,000 three-quarter ton pickup trucks manufactured between 1960 and 1965 that the wheels are defective . The Nader contingent had been arguing the point since November , 1968 , when it launched the NHSB on a study by its reports that wheels of trucks in motion were literally exploding , shooting metal fragments into passing cars . Two studies by bureau engineers , only recently made known to the public , disclosed that the wheels , manufactured by Michigan 's Kelsey-Hayes Corporation , of some 200,000 pickup trucks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the private meetings that then began with NHSB officials that only the wheels on the roughly 50,000 pickup trucks equipped with campers or other heavy bodies were involved . It argued the failures were the result of over loading and said that the strength of the wheels varied with the size of the tires installed . Compromise reached Finally in October , 1969 , before a DOT administrative decision had actually been reached on whether the 50,000 or the full 200,000 trucks were involved , Francis Turner , head of the Federal Highway Administration announced a compromise . GM had offered to replace the wheels of the 50,000 trucks at its own expense and the government decided to accept it . As Larry Schneider , NHSB 's acting chief counsel , explains it , the government has no power to force a recall anyway . It can only require the manufacturer to send a certified letter , notifying owners that their cars have possible defects . The manufacturer decides whether he wishes to bear the expenses or let the customer do so . Mr. Schneider says that since GM offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOT studies at the time showed it was mainly trucks with campers or other heavy bodies which experienced the wheel difficulty , NHSB opted for the compromise . " Our experience has been that unless the offer to replace is at the manufacturer 's expense , the average guy is n't going to take advantage of it , " he says . " Once the manufacturer sends the letter , " counters Bruce Montgomery , a public-interest lawyer working with Mr. Nader on the GM case , " he usually pays the expenses ? otherwise he 's a sitting duck for damage action . DOT should have required that the defect notice be sent to all 200,000 truck owners . " The following March Mr. Nader filed suit , charging the government with ignoring the reports of its own engineers . He asked that the investigation be reopened and that the earlier announcement be " corrected . " The renewed investigation launched by the NHSB confirmed the earlier findings and this month the DOT broadened its directive to include all 200,000 trucks . During the developments , a public hearing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us this is the most important part of the case , " notes Mr. Montgomery . " It sets a precedent for all future proceedings . " The safety bureau did try to step up its , power last spring through stronger recall legislation . The measure that passed the Senate but failed in the House would have enabled the NHSB to force recall at the manufacturer 's expense . ? At the moment NHSB officials are concerned about the outcome of their ostensibly bold request for recall of the GM trucks . As soon as the announcement was made , GM filed suit in a Wilmington . Del. , federal court , asking judicial review . The government has countered with a suit of its own .. Meanwhile , the 150,000 truck owners go unnoticed . Though the bureau has taken its knocks in criticism on some of its recall efforts , or the lack of them , it has been particularly thorough in ? school-bus recalls . Requests to GM for such recalls have been made in each of the past three years .
