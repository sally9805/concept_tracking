Sizing up the ungainly red rig in a Prague parking lot , one puzzled passerby conjectured that it was a dormitory-on-wheels for an ascetic order of monks . <P> Another observer , spotting a bus-trailer combine on a dusty back road in India , ? guessed that it must be a fancy transport for carrier pigeons . Equally baffled reactions greet Rotels wherever they turn up , from Tehran to Tierra del Fuego . Rotels ? It is short for " rolling hotels , " which may be the ultimate in no frill , **32;4889;TOOLONG world travel . <P> There are 42 Rotels based in twelve countries and all owned by Rotel Tours a West German travel firm . In the 17 years since its first Mercedes bus dormitory left Munich for Jerusalem , the company has booked more than 150,000 customers on trips through scores of nations on six continents . Thi year some 20,000 passengers will choose to leave the driving , the cooking , the sleeping arrangements and almost everything else to Rotels . <P> The Rotel catalog offers 92 different itineraries , ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England to month-long trek across the Middle East , Afghanistan , the Ukraine , Thailand and Malaysia , Australia , South America and the U.S When Peking permits , Rotel will probably offer 30-day tours of mainland China for around $2,000 . At prices ranging from about $100 a day for a seven day trip to Rome and Assisi to $2,00 ( for a 40-day Australian marathon , Rotels are probably the cheapest way available anywhere to see the world . <P> But not the easiest .

In the evening the juggernaut pulls into a camping ground or stops at a village fountain , and the action shifts to the 40-ft. trailer hitched to the rear . It becomes an outdoor kitchen , dining area , dressing room and dormitory . After supper the tourists repair to the sleeping quarters : a morguelike arrangement of 3-ft-wide bunks stacked three high and 13 across , each with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests Devil 's Island more than a dream vacation . Rotels have no toilet facilities ; when there is no campground , oasis or hotel on their route , passengers go without bathing . Each morning after breakfasting and making their beds , they resume their seats in the bus for another ten hours on the road . Only two meals a day are included : tea or coffee , bread , butter and jam for breakfast and " quality German cooking " - all canned-for supper . Passengers must use the same sheets for the duration of the trip and , on journeys through remote areas , be prepared-as a German woman put it-to " sleep in our own dirt . " One tall tourist found the beds so cramped that he had to sleep with his legs sticking out of the window ; at least , he suggested , the management should provide bed socks .
