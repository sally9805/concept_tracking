Unlike the physical sciences , the behavioral disciplines offer no absolutes . On practically any issue , " scientific " evidence is used to support diametrically opposite points of view . Take vasectomy , for example . According to one recently reported investigation , this procedure for male sterilization ( in which the tubes that transport sperm are severed ) makes sex more pleasurable and marriage happier . According to another , the operation can lead to less satisfying sex , and ultimately to separation and divorce . <P> The favorable findings come from the Midwest Population Center of Chicago , a nonprofit medical organization that does nothing but perform vasectomies . To evaluate its work , the center sent questionnaires to 740 couples six months after vasectomy . Of the 320 who replied , 70% said that the husband 's birth control operation had resulted in " a better sex life , " while 30% reported no change . Of the men , 93% asserted that they felt " exactly as much a man as before " ; another 6% felt even more masculine . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22% described it as enhanced . An improved relationship was reported by 32% of the couples ; 18% believed that they had better rapport with their children since vasectomy . <P> On the other hand , Family Service-Travelers Aid of Des Moines , a social agency that gives help for marital problems , studied 26 couples who came for counseling ; in each case the husband had had a vasectomy performed . In this group the operation resulted in " relatively disastrous " consequences , with worsening of old problems or development of new ones . Some of the wives began to feel that their husbands were " no longer a man . " Extramarital affairs became more frequent , drinking and job troubles increased , and minor disagreements seemed less tolerable . Though the number of cases in the study is small , Staff Supervisor Shirley Southwick of the Family Service Organization of Worcester , Mass. , asserts that they are not atypical : across the country , she says , marriage counselors have growing doubts that vasectomies are always benign . <P> Though it is impossible to know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may result from the psychological health-or distress - of the couples before vasectomy . In the unsuccessful cases the marriages were immature to begin with , Family Service reports . Both husbands and wives were dependent personality types who chose sterilization because it was easy , sure to work , simple to obtain and required no continued effort or selfdiscipline . They looked to the operation as a magic cure-all for problems ranging from sexual inadequacy to financial insecurity . Inevitably , they were disappointed . <P> But the results of vasectomy need not be unpredictable . " Men with healthy egos and self-confidence apparently can accept sterility without psychological dysfunction , " Southwick believes . The moral of the two studies , then , may be that vasectomy should be preceded by psychiatric consultation-a requirement that responsible vasectomy centers already demand .
