At a news conference at the airport here , Senator Eagleton said , " In the last analysis the decision is going to be made by George . " But he quickly added : " If my visceral feeling is that my candidacy is untenable and is negative insofar as the ticket is concerned , I 'll not even wait for to give me the word . I 'll give the word myself . " I want George in the White House and I would n't do anything to keep him from obtaining that goal , " he said .

Nixon did in 1952 , when disclosures about his financial support jeopardized his place on the Republican ticket with I General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower . At a news conference today , Senator Eagleton acknowledged that his staff had misled the public in Missouri about his illnesses and had told newspapers , when he went to the ' Mayo Clinic in 1966 for electric shock therapy , that he had gone to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for treatment of gastro-intestinal difficulties .
