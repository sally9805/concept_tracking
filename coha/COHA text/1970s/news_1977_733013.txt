txt In the cold war , this city of two million people was a brave symbol of Western freedom and prosperity 110 miles inside Communist East Germany . Today , in the anguish of urban decline , some Berliners are wondering whether their city has become a casualty of detente . Soviet tanks no longer rumble menacingly up to the Berlin wall . Since 1972 West Berliners have been free to visit relatives in East Germany , and people and goods can move freely over the transit routes through Communist territory to and from West Germany . Yet investors are not investing and builders are not building . The city is growing shabbier , its population older and smaller than in cold-war days . West Berlin would be bankrupt were it not for outside financial aid . Like New York City , West Berlin is a thriving cultural and entertainment capital despite its other troubles . " But New York does n't have our problem , which is ' What are we here for ? ' " said Gunter Struve , an aide to West Berlin 's beleaguered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special place in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy visited after the CotnmuR . WHITNEY ' e Now York Times nists had sealed it off with the wall and told a cheering crowd , " Ich bin ein Berliner . " Fifteen years later , Mayor Schutz said , " Berlin should he a big city just like any other . " And now he concedes he made a psychological error . In the last five years , West Berlin has lost nearly a quarter of its industrial jobs , down to 189,000 this year from 265,000 in 1970 . The population is al most twice as " old " as in most Wes German cities , with nearly a quarte of the people over 65 . The Kurfilrstendamm , the city 's pre mier boulevard , still glitters , but in creasingly with signs like " Blue Movie One and Two " and " Burger King . " Instead of being united in patriotic purpose , the city 's political parties are embroiled in sordid squabbles and a mire of municipal corruption . Instead of rattling sabers , the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy of bureaucratic restrictions on the contacts West Berliners are permitted to have with family and friends across the border . Visa fees , $4 " street-use " fees and continuing attacks on West Berlin 's political ties with West Germany have kept many of the cold-war tensions alive . Some people are fed up , and for every one attracted by the urbanity of life here others are put off by its limitations . Heinz Adamwicz , a 48-year-old steel worker , came to look for a job the other day and said : " Unemployment in the winter is n't so bad  --  this is seasonal work . But I 'm getting older . I 'd like to buy a house in the suburbs , get some fresh air , be able to drive 20 miles out into the country when I want to , and you ca n't do that here  --  the wall . " He plans to move to some city in West Germany when he can , though he 's lived in West Berlin for 30 years . At a municipal clubhouse for the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gossip with three friends the other day and said : " I 've lived here all my life , and once a Berliner , always a Berliner . But I think the Russians are going to wait until we 've finished building up West Berlin and then come in and take over . " Her friend Gertrud Eiger said , " Do n't be foolish . " She lived in the bombedout ruin of her apartment house for several years after the war and has a brother in East Berlin whom she could n't even visit until 1972 . " But I was always uneasy going across the border , " she says , " and I do n't go to visit him any more . " Desire to Go West She will stay in her two-room apartment in the center of West Berlin , but says her 40-year-old son wouid like to leave . " We lived in Silesia before the war and he remembers the mountains , " she says . " He 'd like to go to the west and live where there are mountains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magda Lehner , an office worker , after collecting her unemployment check the other day . " A good apartment has always been hard to get , and now jobs are hard to find . " " I 'd leave if I could afford to , " she said , although she was born here and has lived in her cold , run-down tworoom apartment since the war . There are 31.000 unemployed workers like her in West Berlin . This is 3.8 percent of the labor force , not so bad as in West Germany . But the economic recovery that set in there in 1976 has still not taken hold in West Berlin . " I have to attract companies to come to West Berlin , to invest in the city , " the mayor said , " and it 's hard . " Other electronics companies with factories here are in even worse shape and the threat of plant closings has begun to stir union unrest in Mayor Schiltz 's Social Democratic constituency . For years , West Berlin has provided tax breaks and other incentives to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Rosenberg , an economist , has been here for five years and soon his fianc  --  e will come from Bonn to join him . If she gets a job with the city power company as she expects , the city will pay for her moving costs . And every employee in West Berlin gets an S percent salary bonus from the Government in Bonn . All these , and countless other things that Bonn does to aid the city , are expensive ? $2.9 billion or 46 percent of the city budget comes from federal funds this year , $500 million more than West Berlin generates in federal taxes . Despite the help , the city has not become a going , autonomous concern . Ten years ago federal subsidies amounted to only 39 percent , and now more people are leaving than settling in . The Soviet Union , which concluded an agreement on Berlin with the United States , Britain and France in 1971 , is constantly accusing West Germany of trying to violate it , and almost every month Bonn accuses East Germany of disregarding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of the winter . Even the city 's politics have been dominated in the last two years by petty scandals . That is just like in any other big West German city , Mayor Schutz maintains , but his Christian Democratic opposition says he should resign . They say that his Social Democrats , the unions , and municipal officials have woven such a close web of corruption over the last 30 years that the only way to make a fresh start is with a new government . A perfect illustration of the corruption is the case of Dieter Schwabl , a Socialist who was caught promoting himself from head of the city 's porcelain factory to head of the sanitation department , and replacing himself with a friend . That scandal cost the deputy mayor for transport his job . Another scandal last year found a mysterious architect , Sigrid Kressmann-Zschach , sharing a hotel room with a high official of the city comptroller 's office after a $100 million office-building project went bankrupt . The deputy mayor for finance quit over that one . " Corruption was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mayor  --  it 's lust that people pay more attention to it than they used to , " the mayor said . " West Berlin is not thought of by West German industry as a national mission any more . " said Dr. Ginter Braun , chairman of the West Berlin Chamber of Commerce . " We 're trying to emphasize the national mission again , but in the end what counts is that it has to be a sound business proposition to invest here . " Nearly all of West Berlin 's trade is with West Germany . Though it is not West German territory , the occupied city is economically fully integrated with West Germany . Since diplomacy reduced tensions with the Soviet Union over the city in 1971. apparently many West German industries are treating their West Berlin branches as purely economic propositions instead of patriotic displays . Companies are not forsaking West Berlin for West German cities , but they 've been cutting back more sharply here . Even Siemens . the electronics giant that was born in Berlin and was the flower of Prussian industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42,000 to 30.000 workers . " We 're not trying to starve out Berlin , " said Dr. Bernhard Plettner , its chairman . But the automated telephone and telex equipment produced here were hard hit by budget cuts in Bonn 's hard-pressed post office department .
