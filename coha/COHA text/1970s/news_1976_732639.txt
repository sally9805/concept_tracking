txt Letters to the Editor pg . 17 Letters to the Editor What U.S. Foreign Policy Should Be To the Editor : With the election coming up , it would be highly desirable to air all views on what American foreign policy should be . With d ? tente suffering from criticism and declining in appeal , both at home and abroad , it is indeed high time to call for a new guiding concept that will give clear direction to U.S. policy . Hence , the concept of " intertwined restraint and redevelopment " is hereby offered . Briefly stated , it has two main principles . First , toward the U.S.S.R. Both superpowers should exercise restraint toward each other as well as toward other nations . And the spirit of restraint does have its positive side of redeveloping desirable relations . The reduction of armament is but one outstanding goal among various possibilities . However , as the redeveloping relations evolve , both sides must , in the spirit of restraint , refrain from making expansionist or imperialistic attempts at the expense of any other nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what most nations in the world are looking for . For instance , china stands opposed to hegemony . It means the same . Second , toward the world at large , the American policy should give particular attention to redeveloping progress in various nations . It should respect , appreciate or at least understand the national and redevelopmentat aspirations of other nations . It should appropriately support such aspirations in varying degrees of desirability and practicality . This is also Schweiker 's ' Moderation ' To the Editor : I am amazed at the screams of dismay emanating from Republican conservatives at the selection of Senator Schweiker by Governor Reagan as his Vice-Presidential designee . Of course , Senator Schweiker voted on the side of his heavily labordominated constituency in industrial Pennsylvania in such matters as pension reform , black lung-disease benefits , consumer protection , etc . However , he also voted against forced busing , abortion , confiscation of citizens ' firearms , and elimination of capital punishment . I 'll stack up Senator Schweiker 's economic liberalism and social moderation with President Ford 's Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedham , Mass. , Aug. 1 , 1976 ? Open Hydrants To the Editor : This is in response to an Aug. 3 letter regarding the waste of water in the City of New York . More so than metering to conserve water , why is not enforcement of open hydrants in New York more diligent ? As I drive and walk the streets of this city , my eyes and senses are shocked at the countless numbers of hydrants left open by irresponsible citizens . Hydrants not only run during the summer months , but right through the winter as well . The city has spent thousands of dollars attaching hydrant harnesses to prevent this waste , but to no avail . My comments not only refer to the street urchins who need to cool off in the A Site To the Editor : Should the gardeners of the world cease growing roses because some people destroy flowers ? I think not . There will always be people who will seek to destroy beauty . I have just returned from a week 's vacation in Montreal attending the Olympic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I read The Times editorial of July 20 complaining of the political use of the games , urging the elimination of team sports , and concluding that the games , as presently conducted , are not worth holding . I strongly disagree . Granted that Prime Minister Trudeau 's action on the Taiwan matter was an abuse of his position as head of the Government of the host country , and that the African nations used the games to gain attention to an issue that had nothing to do with the Olympics . However , how much attention was given by the press to the good that is achieved by athletes and sports buffs of the world meeting and gaining better understanding of problems in other parts of the world ? The Queen of England was in Montreal with really not a great deal of protection and I saw no demonstration against her by any French separatist , only warm affection in largely French Montreal . On opening day , I wondered Milton Harris what most nations would welcome . However , the American role must be a restrained one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . In the main , they should do it themselves . As an objective example , China 's case is inspiring ; selfreliance , even in meeting earthquake disaster . In short , this kind of American foreign policy would be selectively outreaching , but neither overreaching into illusion , nor retreating into isolation . JAMES T. C. Ltu Princeton , N. J. , Aug. 6 , 1976 summer , but the ever growing number of " street car washers , " " sidewalk repair shops , " and also to construction crews and repair crews , who walk away from the work site at the end of the day and leave hydrants running . I strongly urge that severe enforcement be instituted and that repair crews be held accountable for carelessness . I also suggest that every member of the following city agencies ? Fire Department , Sanitation , municipal street repair crews , etc. ? be instructed to turn off all hydrants they see open . The consequences of a city without water could be catastrophic . FREDERICK W. VILLEGAS Riverdale , N. Y. , Aug. 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we congratulate ourselves on negotiating an " orderly marketing " agreement with Japan in specialty steel , in effect , achieving quotas without a quota onus , it is well to bear in mind the price that is paid . Overwhelmingly , import quotas imply export cartels and specialty steel is no exception . The July 6 issue of the " Japan Economic Journal " carries the story , " 21-firm cartel will be established for governing specialty steel export . " The story begins , " Three small specialty steel producers and eighteen traders will form an export cartel during July in line with the recent Japan-U.S. agreement on specialty steel restraint . " When will we realize that for a country which treats cartels as illegal per se , it is anomalous to insist on cartelization as a condition for trade ? ELEANOR M. HADLEY Washington , July 31 , 1976 what attitude the team from Ireland would display when they entered the stadium and passed before the Queen . The result , a polite dipping of their flag and the removal of their hats in respect . Eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relays , field hockey , rowing , etc. , as suggested by The Times . Definitely not . Nothing wrong with hard sports competition between nations . Probably the greatest thrill I personally experienced during the week was seeing the Israeli soccer team in two exciting matches against Mexico and France . Although it is clear that the organizing committee is very autocratic and disrespectful of the general public , as was witnessed by the fact that the best 350 seats for every event were reserved for the committee , but were rarely used , while fans were paying premium prices to attend , the games must continue . In fact , considering the existing facilities we have in New York City , I will be requesting our city government to consider making an application to bring the summer games of 1984 to our city . That would be an experience for New Yorkers that I am sure was not predicted by Mr. Orwell . EDWARD H. LEHNER Member of Assembly , 73d Dist . New York , July 30 , 1976 Improving Health Care To the Editor . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the role and importance of basic biomedical research was distorted ahnost beyond recognition . It was suggested that my message and that of others to the National Institutes of Health was : " Stop wasting your time with basic research ; get busy curing cancer , diabetes , heart disease , etc . " This formulation is , of course , ludicrous . It has never been my view  --  nor was it proposed at my recent Senate Health Subcommittee hearings ? that we should stop doing basic biomedical research . Contrast the implications or your editorial with my actual word from the Congressional Record of last November 10 : " As we turn our attention more and more to the pressing problems of health care delivery in this country , we must not lose sight of the important role that fundamental biomedical research plays in this process . The practice of medicine to day is based upon the broad foundation provided by yesterday 's research effort . We must continue this effort as an investment in the future , and past experience shows that this investr ment ultimately pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , as I said at the hearing on June 16 , the maturing public acceptance of an investment in basic research obliges researchers and clinicians " . . . to struggle all the horder to apply this science to public need , and stretch their work from laboratory to bedside . " We have demonstrated our capacity to do basic research . However , we will not have fulfilled our contract with the taxpayer until we have matched the excellence of opt efforts in basic research with a com : parable effort to apply new knowledge to improve the quality of day-to-dty health care in every community in our nation . The National Institutes of Health and the research community are already , of course , engaged in clinical research , clinical trials , and other efforts to bridge the gap from " bend to bed . " The point of these hearings is to examine whether we are , in fact , doing all that we can in this area , and to review a wide range of issues growing ? out of the relationships between biomedical research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research community in conducting this review of our national policy . EDWARD M. KENNEDY United States Senator , Massachusetts Washington , Aug. 3 , 1976 ' ? For Two-Man Police Cars , To the Editor : A letter printed on Aug. 4 , had in the author 's very words , a simple solu-. tion to reduced police radio car patrol at no increased expense to the city . This is to assign one police officer to each patrol car and this would , in ' effect , double the amounts of patrol . This novel idea is at least fifty yearsold . It is contemporaneous with an actual lawsuit in this state brought by an economist against a business firm . for payment to him for his unique ? idea to double profits by doubling prices . Technological advancement and in7 creased automation may soon find a radio car dispatched to the scene of . a crime , accident or disaster without any police officers . But , what does it do when it gets there ? Police experience in New York City , contradicts arithmetic . It shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times better than one . The writer 's gratuitously expressed non sequitur stating that this plan will find no acceptance because the P.B.A. places its own interests above the welfare of the city is unkind and uninformed . Shooting , maiming and killing of policemen do not add to the welfare of this city . Diminution of the effectiveness or the radio motor patrol force responding to an emergency does not add to the confidence of this populated , corn ' : plicated , sophisticated , well-motivated , ill-regulated , " X " - rated , but not yet devastated nor ill-fated , community . BERNARD F. DUHAN New York , Aug. 5 , 1976 ? Beame-Byrne Programs To the Editor : There seems to be a bipartisan agreement in New Jersey that Gover- : nor Byrne is the worst we have ever had . Mayor Beame seems bent on achieving a similar distinction as Mayor of New York . Both men , irt defiance of the wishes of the people most concerned , in opposition to environmental objections , regardless off ' need and heedless of effects , are pursuing projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing wisdom , because " we need the jobs . " The construction , in the face of community resistance in both areas , of an amusement park in Staten Island and highway 1.287 in New Jersey . flouts any pretense of responsiveness to the wishes of the governed . The highway will save us the time that wO may then spend in the dreary pleasures of an amusement park . Both projects surely represent all the worst of our society  --  concrete and synthetic happiness . They destroy beauty , peace , the landscape and bring us ih their place all that Is most meretricious in our civilization . Both the Mayor and the Governor are bowing to the wishes of the construction unions , No one lacks synipathy for those in need of work , brit surely there are projects at hand that will provide more truly constructive benefits for all of society .
