Over the telephone , as well as in the courtroom , alibis often tend to fall apart . A phone call to the wife pleading late work at the office , for example , is less than convincing with the noisy hilarity of a swinging singles bar audible in the background . Similarly , the **32;16491;TOOLONG ploy is apt to prove a dud with a boss whose receiver is also picking up the strains of a jukebox or the cries of a ballpark hot dog vendor . To prevent such pretexts from collapsing , help is finally at hand : alibi tapes . <P> Devised by a Manhattan recording production firm , Leisure Data , Inc. , the tapes-available as cassettes or cartridges-supply the proper noisy backdrop for eight separate situations . The familiar noises of a traffic jam , the jet whines and flight announcements of a busy airport , the sounds of a crowded lobby , a phone booth at Grand Central Station or Macy 's department store , an array of long-distance operators from major U.S. cities , a hospital or office milieu-the whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to alibi tapes came to Leisure Data President Steve Lichtenstein when he saw the movie The Owl and the Pussycat . " George Segal had this tape of a barking dog , " he remembers , " and I suddenly saw the possibilities . The whole country is paranoid , especially city apartment dwellers . So I got an attack dog and taped him trying to chew me up . It began selling 1,000 copies a week all over the country , just so people could switch it on when the doorbell rang . " Soon Lichtenstein 's out-of-work friends asked him to tape a selection of office background noise , the better to telephone for job interviews without betraying that they were at home and unemployed . <P> Alibi Cartridges . There are different reels for different deals . One businessman , according to Lichtenstein , established a reputation as a highly mobile go-getter and " destroyed his competitor by calling an account from five different cities in the space of one day . " The wild-party tape has its advocates . " A guy wanted this girl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She thought there was a party , but when she got there , there were only the two of them . " A major liquor distiller has ordered 500 sets of alibi cartridges and tape players to be installed in bars throughout Manhattan for the coming Christmas season . Signs will offer them to customers , compliments of the company . The tapes will enable long-staying patrons to have one for the road while providing an alibi that is sound .
