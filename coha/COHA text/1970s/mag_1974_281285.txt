As the flag-draped coffin of General George Grivas was lowered into the ground last week in the southern Cyprus city of Limassol , a tearful crowd of 50,000 took up their old battle cry , " Enosis or death ! " But enosis ( union with Greece ) seemed farther away than ever for Cyprus . Grivas ' death at 75 of a heart attack may finally have brought to an end the reckless terrorist campaign for enosis that he had led since his secret return to the island in 1971 . <P> To many Greeks , the slight , mustachioed Grivas was more god than man . He was already a legend during World War II , when he led a feared band of right-wing guerrillas that fought against the German occupation of Greece and , more actively , against Greek Communist partisans . Then in the 1950s his skillful command of EOKA , the Greek Cypriot guerrilla army , ended British control of the island and gained for Grivas a place in the Greek pantheon of heroes . <P> But his image had been tarnished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assassination attempts that his revived underground organization , EOKA-B , conducted against the government of Archbishop Makarios had become increasingly unpopular among the island 's inhabitants . Most Cypriot Greeks , while holding to enosis as a political ideal , had long recognized the impossibility of forcing the island 's Turkish minority ( 20% ) into accepting union with Greece . Even the government in Athens had condemned Grivas ' terrorist campaign . And in Cyprus , the general 's repute had sunk so low that the House of Representatives , just before his death , was threatening to brand him " a common criminal " unless he ceased his guerrilla activities . <P> After Grivas ' death , Archbishop Makarios proclaimed an amnesty for all imprisoned and wanted EOKA-B members ; in response , Grivas ' successor as head of EOKA-B ordered a stop to all terrorist activities . While not officially identified , the new commander is thought to be Major Vassilios Kourkafas , a relatively unknown Greek army officer . There remained some concern that the more fanatical elements of the EOKA-B would renew the terrorist campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred men would survive without Grivas ' leadership .
