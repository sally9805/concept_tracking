" We like democracy . Soldiers like democracy . Everyone likes democracy . " <P> - Thai Army Secretary Kriengsak Chamanan <P> Less than a month after it ousted the fractious democratic government of Prime Minister Seni Pramoj , the Thai military 's 24-man National Administrative Reform Council ( NARC ) formally turned over the reins of authority to a civilian Cabinet . In ceremonies presided over by King Bhumipol Adulyadej , NARC 'S nominal chief , Admiral Sangad Chaloryu , even bade an official farewell to the nation as a new civilian Prime Minister , Tanin Kraivixien , 49 , was sworn in . A former justice of the Thai Supreme Court , Tanin announced that Thailand would be " guided " by stages back to full democracy . " From now on , " he said , " NARC is the outer shell that protects the snail . " <P> A snail 's pace seems an apt metaphor for Tanin 's plans to delay transition back to " full democracy " for at least eight years .

Among its first official acts was the appointment of a committee to probe graft . As Army Secretary Kriengsak Chamanan , NARC 's minence grise , told TIME Correspondent William McWhirter , " We have learned the lessons of South Viet Nam and Laos . In those countries , corrupted politicians were a main cause of their downfall .
