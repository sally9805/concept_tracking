An eerie clue to Sindona <P> Was he , or was n't he ? When Michele Sindona , 59 , Italy 's notorious fallen angel of high finance , was first reported kidnaped from a Manhattan street two months ago , Italians as well as U.S. authorities were skeptical . Most believed that the native Sicilian had arranged his own disappearance . After all , he was about to stand trial in New York City on a 99-count indictment of financial finagling , and was wanted in Milan on charges of bank fraud totaling $225 million . <P> Now officials in both countries have a persuasive reason to fear that Sindona really was abducted . Their clue : a Polaroid color snapshot of a scraggy Sindona as an apparent captive . It was delivered to the Rome office of Sindona 's lawyer , Rodolfo Guzzi , in a plain envelope postmarked Sept. 8 , Brooklyn , N.Y . It shows Sindona , gaunt and pale , hair unwashed and jowls unshaved , seated on a plain wooden chair . A cardboard sign covering his chest carries an ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROCESSO LO FAREMO NOI ( The fair trial will be conducted by us ) . <P> Enclosed with the photo was a scathing , ten-point " interrogation " about his alleged wheeling and dealing , apparently handwritten by Sindona under duress . The questions demand detailed information from Guzzi about illegal deals that Sindona reportedly conducted through his banks on behalf of some of Italy 's leading politicians and businessmen , and the Vatican to boot . Guzzi is instructed in the note to be ready-if he is telephoned by one of the captors-to reply to all of the questions within ten minutes . <P> The picture evokes painful memories of the comparable photo of Aldo Moro before he was murdered by his Red Brigades abductors last year . More than that , if the allegations were even partly true , they would set off a Vesuvius of scandal . The group claiming to hold Sindona , the Proletarian Committee of Subversion for Better Justice , is unknown to Italian police , and some authorities still believe Sindona may be only pretending . Lawyer Guzzi theorizes that the kidnapers may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for extortion . Says he : " I do n't believe for one moment that they are terrorists in the political sense . I think they are criminal blackmailers. "
