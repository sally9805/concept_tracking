Peking decides its " people 's war " needs some Occidental punch <P> They did not exactly go around kicking the tires of Jeeps or thumping the sides of armored vehicles , but in other respects the Chinese officers were behaving just like wide-eyed customers inspecting the new models in an auto showroom . Evincing much more interest than the representatives of the 60 other countries attending Britain 's Aldershot exhibit of glittering military equipment last week , a six-member Chinese military delegation moved slowly from display to display . It intently studied the Chieftain tank , asked detailed questions about the Clansman tactical communications system and carefully examined dozens of examples from among the 10,000 other items of defense hardware being offered for sale . <P> In the meantime , a second delegation of Chinese military men was ending a twelve-day tour of Sweden 's defense facilities . There they had looked at , among other things , Swedish-built submarines and the Saab-Scania supersonic Viggen fighter jet . This week the delegation heads southward to see what Italian manufacturers offer in the way of land , air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited France last autumn to inspect materiel there . <P> The Chinese have been mostly looking , not buying , but they are clearly interested in acquiring advanced Western military equipment . This sharp and very recent departure from the Maoist policy of " self-reliance " in arms betrays Peking 's deepening concern over the adequacy of its defense forces and the relevance of Mao 's dictum that " the richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people . " For decades this " people 's war " strategy led Chinese generals to maintain religiously that their hordes of soldiers would triumph over any attacker , no matter how sophisticated his weapons . As a result , Peking all but ignored the advances in weapons technology that other countries have been pressing to achieve . Thus while China today can boast the world 's largest standing military force , its 3.95 million soldiers , sailors and airmen ( compared with 3.67 million for the U.S.S.R. and 2 million for the U.S. ) are equipped with obsolete arms . <P> The Chinese air force , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , but comprises mostly various home-built versions of the MiG-19 , a Soviet fighter of the 1950s based on now outdated technology . Facing the obsolescent Chinese MiGs are some of the Kremlin 's hottest new war planes , including the high-flying MiG-25 Foxbat . <P> Peking 's ground forces are not in much better shape . While Chinese-produced rifles ( based on the Soviet AK-47 ) and grenades are of high quality , artillery and antitank weapons lack modern infrared and laser aiming devices . Most of China 's tanks , moreover , are copies of Soviet products that are at least a generation old and no match for the powerful new T-72s that the Russians are beginning to deploy along the tense , 4,500-mile Sino-Soviet border . Even Peking 's atomic force lacks punch . China has 80 nuclear-tipped missiles , but only two or three of them are in the 3,500-mile intercontinental-range category .
