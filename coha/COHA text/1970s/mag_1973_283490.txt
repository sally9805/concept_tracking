LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL <P> Directed by SID LEVIN a nd BOB ABEL <P> Flashback to the teen-age ' 50s : <P> grease and black leather jackets , ankle bracelets , fins on cars , proms . And rock ' n ' roll . In the cascade of nostalgia currently inundating the country , an entrepreneur named Richard Nader resurrected an assortment of vintage rock acts ( Danny and the Juniors , the 5 Satins , Chubby Checker ) and packaged them into a free-floating concert tour called the Rock and Roll Revival . This film is a sort of illustrated program of the show , featuring backstage high lights , biographical chatter and large-scale photo portraits of the stars . <P> Had it been content to record the onstage performances of the musicians , many of them still rowdy and full of solid , rough energy , the movie would have been enjoyable enough . Film Makers Levin and Abel , however , have also tried to compress the history of the ' 50s between the concert scenes . Some of the stock footage they unearthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> scenes from television quiz shows like Strike It Rich and Queen for a Day ; lectures from the P.T.A . chairwoman about dress codes for the local high school , and from city officials about the dangers of this new music ( it was supposed to promote riots , you may recall ) ; Brando on a motorcycle , James Dean slumped across the front seat of a car , Michael Landon turning into a foaming teen-age werewolf . <P> As long as they concentrate on dusting off these pop curiosities , Levin and Abel do well enough . But they also try , unfortunately , for something a little more substantial . Adlai Stevenson joins Jayne Mansfield , Khrushchev is paired off with the Coasters . There is even a bathetic requiem to some departed figureheads of the decade as the 5 Satins sing I 'll Be Seeing You : <P> Spencer Tracy , Judy Garland , Montgomery Clift - a soggy and unintentionally demeaning memorial . It is the music that comes off best . The Shirells are funny and sexy , Bo Didley wonderfully raunchy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still kinetic and outrageous . He is a performer who neatly and emphatically encapsulates the lowdown power of rock'n'roll . <P> J.C .
