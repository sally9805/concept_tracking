txt LOS ANGELES  --  The 85 passengers boarding many Flying Tiger Lines flights to Asia these days are docile despite the spartan service  --  no food , drinks . or stewardesses . In fact , Flying Tiger does n't even provide seats . But the only complaints the airline occasionally hears are from its crews . They sometimes find the smell overpowering . Ws not difficult to understand why . Flying Tiger is in the skyrocketing bustness of flying livestock to Asia . " SEVEN YEARS ago when we started this from San Francisco with ** the crew had to fly most of the route with their oxygen masks on , " said Peter E. Hubbard , the airline 's charter operations manager . " Now , I think most of our crews would rather fly cattle than people , " he said . " The cattle do n't complain about the service , " Increased food and breeding demands in both the Far and Near East during the last three years have taxed the imagination of the men who run this Los Angeles-based freight airline , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of Gen , Claire Chennault 's legendary Flying Tigers fighting group during World War II . Its first flight from California to // Column 1 You name it , Flying Tiger will carry it // Middle East than the rest of the country , " Hubbard said . IN ONE RECENT week , five Flying Tiger flights left O'Hare for Iran loaded with Holsteins . " For several years now , Iran has had a big program to build its cattle iiidusMichigan was loaded with flowers . It now flies such unusual cargo as live eels , cattle , pigs , fish , sheep , chickens , and tuna . Even an occasional load of sea urchins is flown to Japan , , which accounts for about 80 per cent of Flying Tiger 's trans-Pacific animal shipments . ? TO ACCOMMODATE the exotic seafood market , Flying Tiger officials are developing , a special water tank , complete with pumps and life support systems , for its planes . ' " We 're developing a container that is being tested right now , " said Charles Malone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost an experimental market for us . " The tanks , when not In use on flights to Japan ? might be used to handle the occasional flight of tropical fish Flying Tiger hauls back to the United States . AIRLINE OFFICIALS contend they will fly almost anything that will fit into a plane  --  except humans . Flying Tiger flies eggs from Europe to the Near East , strawberries to Paris , chestnuts from Europe to Canada , grapes from South America to the U. S. , and fresh produce from California to Hong Kong . " We even had an airplane full of monkeys at one time , " Hubbard said . But none of the food commodities handled by Flying Tiger has expanded as quickly in recent years as the cattle shipments to Asia , despite the quarantine and customs problems animals present shippers , Cattle must be quarantined and Inspected by veterinarians for disease both before and after shipment across international lines , citICAGO 'S O'HARE International Airport is a center for export of breedleg stock to Iran , and flights leave regularly from the West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The U. S. Department of Agriculture estimates that cattle shipments from America to those three countries will expand from nearly 5,300 head in 1974 , to nearly 25,000 head this year . Of that , the U. S , will supply about 8,000 of the 13,000 head bound for Iran . Because of the expansion of the shipment of impregnated breeding cattle to Iran , " this year Chicago has emerged as ' a much bigger export center for the try , " Hubbard said . " We 're in the third year of their 10-year program , . " Shipping animals by air is not cheap . The transportation costs exceed the price of the animals , Hubbard said . From Chicago , a cow selling for $750 would cost $900 to ship by air to Iran , For Japan , the cost of air-shipping live cattle doubles the price of the steak , " ROUND STEAK in one Tokyo restau ? rant sold last week for $7 a pound , " one Flying Tiger official said . " People in Asia are acquiring a taste for beef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its small beef industry . Kobe beef is world famous , But times have changed. , " They have acquired a taste for beef and ca n't keep up with the demand . So they have to import . " TILE JAPANESE now eat an average of 8 pounds of beef a year , far below the U , S. average of 120 pounds , but nearly double the amount they ate a decade ago . Apparently , the Japanese pocketbook is willing to support the increased appetite for beef . The Animal Transport Association estimated that in 1078 , about $2 million was spent to ship livestock to the Orient , The worldwide animal air shipment cost was $28 million . Despite the high cost of air freight , U. S. cattle still sell for less in Japan than do their domestic herds , officials said . This year , cattle shipments to Japan are expected to be 1,500 head  --  up front 661 in 197A , BEEF IS N'T the only U. S. commodity for which the Japanese have acquired a taste .

To handle the market , Flying Tiger developed en insulated container thpt keep the fish between 35 and 38 degrees , Each " Igloo , " as airline officials call them , can carry up to seven of the 600-to 700-pound fish . Flying cattle , however , does not present as many problems , The cattle are loaded on Flying Tiger 's DC-8 freighters en ramps much like those used on railroad curs years ago , Once inside the plane , they are herded into collapsible lightweight pens and packed as tightly as possible to avoid movement . Each plane holds eight such corrals , AIRLINE OFFICIALS do not sedate the cattle before takeoff . " Flying at high altitudes makes them pretty docile , " Hubbard said , Because the flights take only hours there Is no need to feed or water the animals , The only problem Is what to do with the piano deck sweepings after the cattle have been delivered .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
