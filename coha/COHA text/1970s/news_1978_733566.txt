txt WASHINGTON ? President Carter 's anti-inflation program will involve greater action by the President himself in a more aggressive plan to head off and publicly criticize excessive wage-price increases , the government 's top inflation fighter said Tuesday . " You 've got to get off your duff and do something , " Barry Bosworth , director of the President 's Council on WagePrice Stability , said in describing the major theme of Carter 's anti-inflation program , to be announced within a week to 10 days . The " do something " determination will not mean the pnnounnement of another anti-inflation plan to replace the voluntary program announced a few months ago , he said , but carrying out the old policy in a more open , tougher way . IN JANUARY , Carter announced an anti-inflation plan that called on businesses and labor unions to cooperate with the government in trimming back wage and mice increases by one-half-of-one per cent each year over the next three years . This deceleration was supposed to take place on an industry-by-industry basis . For its part , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully and try to talk major companies into holding the line below the average price increase within their industry . Bosworth said it 's taken three months for the administration to settle on its plan of action . " You have to have the vigorous involvement of the President and his advisers , " he said . " You have to continually raise the inflation issue every day . We have not at this stage been aggressive enough in doing that . " ASKED WHY the President had not been more actively involved in the past , Bosworth said that he and other economic advisers had been unable to come up with an " attractive means of fighting inflation " until early this year . He said the council does not need new legal powers to carry out the more vigorous effort . Bosworth said the program will involve first sitting down with an industry before it announces a price or wage increase to try to settle on a responsible wage-price policy . But then , he said , if a company or union went beyond that , it // Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public identification by the White House . For example , he said , " In autos , that can be very effective . I do n't think the auto industry likes criticism . It affects demand . The consumer may not want to buy if lie thinks prices may come down . So it is not an idle threat . " AS FOR THE council , he said that when it deals with major companies it will try to be responsible . " We 'll try not to make mistakes . " He said the council will approach companies with an open mind and say , " Look , we 're Ignorant " about their price policies and seek cooperation . Bosworth said another part of the program could Involve a greater use of government buying policies to put the squeeze on companies that raise prices unreasonably . For example , if a certain product is priced out of line with what it should bring on the market , he said , " the federal government can try to find a substitute . " As for wages , Bosworth said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint " unless you do it yourself . " He indicated that Carter will impose a ceiling on federal pay increases . The ceiling Is reported to be 5,5 per cent . AN EMPLOYER " can use this as an effective argument " at the bargaining table , he said , In addition , Boswo.:a said the seine principle could be used at the state and local government level . " You can extend the same principle to the Postal Service , " he said . A new contract will be negotiated by postal workers later this year . He indicated that Carter will be tough in seeking restraint in that contract . Bosworth said the administration is satisfied over the rollback of U. S. Steel 's price increase from $10.50 to $5.50 a ton  --  and he cited that as an example of what the governmmt will be doing in the wage-price area in the future . Carter himself criticized the increase , and the council did some behindthe-scenes negotiating . BOSWORTH CONFIRMED that he and other administration officials called National'Steel and persuaded that firm to undercut U.S. Steel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it because of their concern for inflation , " he said . Other details of Carter 's anti-inflation program involve , among other things , allowing greater timber cute on public lands and urging Congress to approve a hospital cost containment program .
