The hotel is actually an extension of the old Peking Hotel and will hear the same name . But there Is no mistaking the effort that has been made to break away from the prudish Image that Chinese hotels have earned among travelers In the past two decades .

Western features added However , it was not for nothing that a design team spent several weeks In Hong Kong studying modern hotels . Features of the new building that are new to China include automatic lobby doors , a painted wall map dividing the world into time zones with a clock for each , and eight automatically synchronized elevators .
