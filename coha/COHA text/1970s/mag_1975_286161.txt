Paul Revere these days gallops onto New York TV screens crying breathlessly : " Independence is here ! Independence is here ! " His message : the South Brooklyn Savings Bank has changed its name to the Independence Savings Bank . He might as well be raising the alarm that from now until July 4 , 1976 , and no doubt beyond , the American consumer will be assailed by an army of business mercenaries out to make money from patriotic fervor . <P> Like a sudden swarm of 200-year locusts , commemorative kitsch is appearing everywhere : plates , mugs and glasses decaled with an eagle or the likeness of George Washington or John Adams or the flag or Archibald Willard 's familiar Revolutionary fife-and-drum trio. * Businessmen are offering patriotic yo-yos , ties , music boxes , telephones , costumes , clocks , T shirts and egg timers . Even foreigners are getting in on the act . Many inexpensive Bicentennial items-though the ads , of course , never say so-are made in Taiwan or Japan . British Airways advertises : " You gave us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll do it again . " <P> Going Zowee . So far , the horde of promotions has drawn a beneficent nod from the guardians of tradition . " I see no harm in these Bicentennial products , " says Robert Williams , executive secretary of the New York chapter of the Sons of the Revolution . " There 's nothing wrong with making a buck . Free enterprise is the thing that has made this country go zowee . " Another reason some approve : makers of souvenirs that meet the modest standards of the Government 's American Revolution Bicentennial Administration pay royalties for the use of ARBA 's imprimatur , and those fees-4% to 15% of sales-have so far earned the Government $700,000 to help finance such projects as a coast-to-coast bicycle trail and ten massive abstract sculptures to be constructed along Interstate 80 in Nebraska . <P> Free Decals . There are also , of course , Bicentennial promotions run by companies that figure to gain nothing more than good will . Philadelphia 's Olney Federal Savings &; Loan is running a series of ads honoring Revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help finance an exhibit called " 200 Years of American Sculpture " that will open at New York 's Whitney Museum next March . IBM has offered $500,000 to help pay for a multimedia exhibit , " The World of Franklin and Jefferson , " that is now touring Europe . But these projects are vastly outnumbered by the kind described by Robert Freedman , president of Streisand , Zuch &; Freedman , a New York ad agency . Says he : " I do n't know how many clients have called and said , ' O.K. , come up with a Bicentennial promotion , ' when they have nothing to do with the Bicentennial and are just trying to sell more .
