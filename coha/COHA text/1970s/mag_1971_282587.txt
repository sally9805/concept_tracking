MR . CAMPION 'S QUARRY by Youngman Carter . 237 pages . Morrow . $5.95 . <P> <P> Somerset Maugham once observed that historians of the future-with whom he confidently identified-may find more to admire in contemporary mystery stories than in purely literary works . Unlike serious novelists , mystery writers must tell a good story and are judged principally on how they tell it . The suspense novel , as Maugham pointed out , should be short , inventive and cleanly written , unencumbered by purple passages or digressions . The detective should be an agreeable and intriguing character - perhaps an eccentric , but never a cartoon . Few writers would pass Maugham 's test more handsomely than the late Margery Allingham , who , along with Dame Agatha Christie and the late Dorothy Sayers , dominated a golden age of suspense that began in England after World War I. Her aristocratic sleuth , Mr. Albert Campion , survived four decades , 20 books and dozens of malefactors before his creator died in 1966 . Even then , he did not retire immediately . Allingham 's plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author 's husband , Philip Youngman Carter , revived Mr. Campion for two more books until he too died in December 1969 . Mr. Campion 's Quarry is his final effort . <P> Miss Allingham 's strength - and her husband's-is clear , serviceable prose , less careless than Agatha Christie 's and less precious than Dorothy Sayers ' . It must be said , though , that Mr. Campion began life in The Black Dudley Murder ( 1928 ) in unblushing imitation of Sayers ' rococo creation , Lord Peter Wimsey . Both were lean , languid young noblemen who spoke in the high whine that Waugh classified as the British upper class baying for broken glass . Both concealed great skill and cunning behind a facade of graceful , gratuitous vagueness . <P> Lord Peter expired after a mere eleven novels , smothered by the author 's love for her creation . But Allingham took a critical look at her man . By Death of a Ghost ( 1934 ) , Campion had dropped his drawl and the pose of an amateur adventurer and become a professional detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been a cat burglar until he put on weight . <P> <P> No small part of the Allingham charm is her chariness with detail . Where Sayers gorges the reader with information about Lord Peter 's mulish family and elegant tastes , Allingham drops only a few facts per book . In Police at the Funeral , for instance , the reader learns that Mr. Campion loathes and suppresses his Christian name , Rudolph , which makes it all the more astonishing to discover-eleven books later-that he has called his own son Rupert . Gradually , too , as the series progresses , a caste of semiregulars assembles : the policemen Gates and Luke , the trouble-prone Faraday clan , Sister Val . Perhaps the apogee of Campion 's career occurred early in World War II in one of the best episodes , Traitor 's Purse . He is called upon to save his embattled country from a massive , ruinous counterfeiting scheme , and he does-despite the fact that throughout the book he has amnesia induced by a blow on the head .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
