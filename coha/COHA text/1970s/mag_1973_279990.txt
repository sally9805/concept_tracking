One morning last week , Saturday Review Executive Editor Ronald P Kriss strolled into what he thought would be a routine conference . He was greeted by an apology from his boss , SR Chairman and Editor in Chief Nicolas Charney , who said that he had been unable to reach his second in command the night before . " Oh , really ? " Kriss replied . " What 's up ? " Then Charney broke the news : Publication would cease immediately , and the company would seek reorganization under the federal bankruptcy statute . The innovative enterprise started 17 months ago , in which the old weekly was converted into four specialized monthlies , had been a total financial failure . <P> Later that morning , the assembled staff was told . Champagne to soothe the shock was provided in paper cups . But the news had been expected for so long that some staffers expressed relief " At least we know now , " said Senior Editor Douglas Gasner " It 's over " <P> Not exactly During a recent desperate search for additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner John Veronis had approached a number of large publishing and communications corporations . " What we needed , " says Charney , " was a corporate shield to survive . We needed someone to take us on so that Madison Avenue would say , ' O.K. , here 's an institution , here 's stability . ' " <P> What they got instead last week was an institution of a different sort-Norman Cousins , the editor of the old Saturday Review for 31 years . He had resigned late in 1971 in protest against the expansive plans that the new owners , Charney and Veronis , had dreamed up for the magazine . If SR creditors approve , Cousins will acquire the titles and unexpired subscriptions of the four Saturday Review monthlies . These , and some of SR 's recent features , will be merged with Cousins ' World , the biweekly he founded after leaving SR . The new title : Saturday Review/World . He plans to offer by early summer regular supplements on science and education . SR 's other two monthly titles , The Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by our general concept . " <P> For Cousins , 60 , the turn of events seemed like a kind of kismet . He had invested most of his professional life in SR and was bitter about surrendering it to two hot entrepreneurs younger than he ( Charney is now 31 ; Veronis is 45 ) . In exile , Cousins was bearish about the prospects of the Charney-Veronis enterprise . Events seem to have vindicated his acumen . " The reason that I left the Saturday Review " he said last week , " was that its fragmentation into four monthlies was not a sound intellectual concept . How could it then be a good business concept ? " If Cousins was elated at his new prospects , some SR staffers in San Francisco found his ascendancy distasteful . " Norman Cousins went out of his way to kill us , " charged one top editor . " He bad-mouthed us to advertisers at every opportunity . "
