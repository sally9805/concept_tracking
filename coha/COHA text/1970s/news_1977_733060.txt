txt But how he played the game ! Tribune Photos by Walter Kale Hie Nastase 's backhand . The bad boy of tennis won , 6-2 , but Bilandic had an excuse : " I had a blister . " Pancho ' Bilandic loses one THE BIG STORY of this year 's Democratic mayoral primary was that the liberal independents stayed out of it . First they did n't slate a candidate , Bill Singer , who might have run , put it best when he said Chicago was n't ready for reform this year , but it would be in 1979 . Until then , he said , he 'd stand aside for " Mayor Daley 's team . " Then , some independents endorsed Harold Washington , a roan whose candidacy was doomed because it was his lousy luck to be born on April 15 , Each year he apparently has to.blow out birthday candles and open his presents when other people are mailing in their income-tax returns . Finally the liberal independents missed a chance to give a spoiler vote to Roman Pucinskl . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties , 50 per cent of them did n't bother to vote . I 'VE BEEN ANALYZING why the city 's liberals suddenly abandoned Close-up With Jeff Lyon heir antima chine strategy this year and let Michael Bilandic have it by default . Now I think I knew why . It is because Bilandic plays tennis . Tennis , you see , is very important to independent voters . It gives them something to do when they are n't eating at Mel Markon 's , or riding their 10-speed bikes , or attending a Channel 11 auction . You are likely to see them any evening or weekend trotting out of their lakefront homes , the joy of competition in their hearts and the handles of aluminum racquets sticking out of their Gucci equipment bags . Or you can spot them sneaking out of the old public-interest law practice Me Nast a s e likes Argentina 's chances against the United States this week in their Davis Cup confrontation in Buenos Aires . See Sports . at lunchtime to squeeze in a set or two . But tennis is net the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogging and handball . And Bilandic does both of them , too , ABOUT THE ONLY TIIING Bilandic does n't play is racquet ball , an oversight I 'm sure he 'll correct by June 7. it 's clear from all this that Bilandic appealed strongly to the Adidas bloc . And if they could n't bring themselves to actually go FOR a machine politician , they were n't going to go AGAINST a fellow tennis player , either . Bilandic realizes the political potential here , and that may explain one of the strangest exhibitions I 've wit // Bilandic loses one , but how he plays the game ! // nessed since George Foreman fought'five towing-service thugs in a row on national TV . For half an hour Sunday afternoon , a chubby-legged Michael Bilandic played regulation singles tennis against the Nastase at the International Amphitheatre . Yes , Ilic Nastase , the same Tile Nastase who two weeks ago beat Jimmy Connors in the World Championship of Tennis Challenge Cup . SWINGING A BRAND new head aluminum racquet and wearing a moth-eaten pair of gym shoes , Bilandic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad Man of tennis while the cameras whirred and snapped away . At times he seemed to handcuff the powerful Nastase , who appeared unaccountably slow in getting to balls on his way to a 6.2 victory over the acting mayor . A few hours later " Pancho " Bilandic 's performance went out on the nightly news for hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to see . Bilandic 's grab for the sports vote is n't new . I was at a De Paul basketball game last January , shortly after Bilandic had became acting mayor by acting as though he was n't going to run for real mayor . Bilandic was going to toss up the first tip of the game , and he was being introduced to the Blue Demon crowd by County Assessor Thomas Tully. " . . . and I give you tonight , " intoned Tully , " a man who in his school days was known as one of Chicago 's greatest young athletes . " IT SOUNDED mighty good and got loud applause . But I must tell you , I 've tried ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth to put him among the likes of Jesse Owens , Ralph Metcalfe , and George Mikan . Or even Elfego Barker , stalwart right fielder on my high school baseball team . To date I 've found nothing . But here Sunday was Pancho  --  Bilandic , battling probably the second-best tennis player in the world . The event has an interesting history . Some weeks ago Nastase , who is Romanian , decided he wanted to stage same benefit matches , with all proceeds going to victims of the recent earthquake in Romania . The affair would be staged in Chicago on April 24 , it was decided , under the title " To Romania With Love . " Fellow tennis stars Guillermo Vitas , Ion Tiriac , and Vitas Gentlaitis would join Nastase in an exciting afternoon of charity tennis . When the promoters brought the advertising copy to The Tribune for publication , the ad contained mention of an exhibition doubles match pitting Nastase and Bilandic against Tiriac and Ald. Edward Vrdolyak ( loth . Almost immediately after the ad appeared , the mayor 's dour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ad was wrong . The mayor knew nothing of such a match , Sullivan said , adding , " He would never participate in something like that . " YET , LAST WEEK the doubles , match was revived in press releases . " On Friday , Mayor Bilandic decided he wanted to play Nastase alone , one on one , " a benefit spokesman told me . " I guess word was passed to Ald. Vrdolyak . " Word was also passed to Wally Piekarski , Piekarski is the tennis director for the Chicago Park District , and he had to roll out of bed and be at the Amphitheatre at 9 a.m . Sunday to give the Chief some practice . I wonder what Bilandic does when he wants to shoot skeet . Does he call up Police ' , , Supt. James Rochford ? At 2 p.m , , following a singles match between Vitas and Nastase , and as 2,000 ticket-holders looked on , Pancho Bilandic trotted out In an orange warmup jacket for his court debut . A BROAD GRIN across his face , Bilandic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor look ? good with the zeal cf an Arthur Murray dance instructor . And , when It was over , his forehead glistening with perspiration , Pancho Bilandic had a ready word for reporters . " I had a blister , " he said . Out in back of the Amphitheatre , the mayor 's driver was sleeping noisily , mouth open , at the limousine wheel . In the building 's massive locker room , the mayor was soaping down in a hot athlete 's shower . And in the hall itself , alongside the limitrepn tennis court , a demure lineswoman sat . She put a ' - tnd to her mouth and spoke confidentially . " In the Nastase-Bilandic match , Mayor Bilandic was foot faulting like crazy , " she said . " I did n't have the heart to call it . " She 'd make a good Chicago election commissioner .
