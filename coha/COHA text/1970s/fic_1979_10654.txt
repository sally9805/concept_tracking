to everyone who sees you , Here 's a woman who do n't care what her husband thinks of her . ' " " I do n't have any husband . " " You never will have as long as you 'd rather be a boy than a wife . " " Fobbed hair does n't have anything to do with being a boy . It 's a fashion . " " It 's a fashion I do n't like . " " It 'll grow out . " " Meanwhile ? " I did n't know about meanwhile . Jake did . " I 'll get you a switch . You can fasten it with combs to the back of your hair . No one will know you 've cut your hair . " Switches were n't unusual then . Mama had worn one for years . All of her hair went into a tall back-combed pompadour leaving almost nothing for a knot . Her knot was a switch , long strands of hair she coiled into a bun and fastened solidly with big bone hairpins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama put her switch on the bank under her shoes and dress . ( Her swimming suit was a makeshift combination of bloomers and corset cover . ) While she was in the water Old Pedro grabbed up her switch and ran along the hank of the river , half the switch streaming behind him from one side of his mouth , half from the other . He looked like some prehistoric : animal come back to life . Joey chased him down and recovered the switch . Mama , usually thrifty , would never , though the switch was unharmed , wear it again . People had seen Old Pedro 's performance . " Wear a clog 's whiskers on my head ? Certainly not . " She bought a new switch , though she did n't throw the old one away . It hung at the hack of her closet till she died . Mama had a pessimistic streak . If the worst came to the worst , and she expected it would , dog whiskers would be better than nothing . Jake bought me a switch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls personal things : not stockings or jewelry , and ert , tinly not underwear . Hair is about as personal as you can get , but since it was something I did n't want and took as a favor to Jake , the act was purer than it would have been otherwise . Sexually pure , that is . Not pure as an honest human act . It wasp151an effort to please . It was an attempt to fabricate an imaginary self who would please Jake . And fool him . Be for him a girl who kowtowedto men ; made a silly mistake and rectified it . Carried away by a passing fad , but able to admit its unsuitability . Why did I do it ? Personal weakness . I 've done more harm by the falseness of trying to please than the honesty of trying to hurt . Jake bought the switch and I wore it . I put a heavy rubber band around the stubby hair ends at the nape of my neck . With another rubber band I anchored the switch there ; then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Jake forgot that my long hair was store-bought . And that 's the only kind of long hair I 've ever had since the cutting . Beneath the long false hair I stayed bobbed . Bobbed , bobbed ! Short hair under the drape of falseness . Some people noticed and wondered . Not Jake . What I said I would do , and what looked as if I had done , was enough for him . To augment your hair is no more a criminal act than to add to your breasts with falsies . Breaking promises , lying , wearing disguises may be the beginning of criminality . I do n't know for sure ; I never went the full route . I did experience some of the deceiver 's thrill when I was complimented on my devotion to old-time values , while I said to myself , " Little do you know . " What I felt , short-haired and disguised as a long-hair , was what any boy , smoking corn silk behind the barn , feels : " I am doing what is forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't hate his parents . He loves them and knows he can fool them . I did n't love Jake ; I recognized his good sense and enjoyed fooling him . Mama asked us to have supper with them . She rejoiced in the attentionJake was showing me and in my response to it . Fired from my job , a woods colt for a daughter , a gossip-provoking choice for a hired man ; and the less said about Lon the better . Jake was the best sign she 'd yet had that , in spite of these misfortunes , I was going to turn out normal . Even Mama 's daughter had been her enemy when the man her daughter talked to was Mama 's husband . When the daughter was safely committed elsewhere emotionally , then the daughter was nop152longer her enemy . After I left home , my mother always fought on my side . Having me and Jake to dinner was her way of saying to Jake , " You 've heard the old saying Like mother , like daughter , ' have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see , for on the way home Jake said , " I 've always heard that if you want to know how the daughter will turn out , visit the mother . What a woman ! " The visit was on one of those August days , tired of July 's blaze and already looking forward to September . The leaves looked ready to drop . They had n't changed color yet , but they were already earth-bound . The clouds , no longer summer 's domes , were streaked with autumn 's mackerel strands . Goldenrod was blazing and farewell-summerwas saying good-bye . The Paige was n't a sedan , so we were n't shut away from the air and the sky , from the tired leaves and the flowers of fall . It was Sunday , and we all had on Sunday clothes . They also gave the day a special feel . Wanda wore a dress Jake had bought for her in Cincinnati . Clothes as a gift for a woman were a sign of intimacy ; of too much intimacy , that is . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most three-year-olds , and toilet-trained to a fare-ye-well , wore a dotted Swiss with a cherry-colored sash . She had cherry-colored shoes to match . Having spent her first months in a schoolhouse and her life since then with grownups , she had no practice in baby talk ; she was more talkative than Coolidge himself . Jake did n't play golf , but he wore a golf suit  --  knickers with long woolen socks and a fancy pair of Hesse brogans with fringed tongues . Jake was built for trousers that hid , not knickers that revealed . I was n't built for the fashions then myself : dresses with waistlines at the hipbones and no indication that between shoulders and hips the body tapered . So we were fashionably if not attractively dressed . And if Jake 's approval of me hinged upon the impression Mama made upon him , we were already engaged . Mama had said more than once in my hearing , " I marry my children off , not on . " She was n't unloving . She knew that a marriagethat made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage for mother or daughter . lake was n't a man , judging by the one she had married . Ile was , though , as she souietlines said ofp153ingredients for gravy , " good husband timber . " Particularly for a daughter who would not , by those who knew her past history , be judged " good wife timber " herself . In Papa , Jake had someone he could talk shoes to . Jake sold shoes and my father sold nursery stock . They were both businessmen . Papa , with the help of nature , produced trees , grape and berry vines , currant bushes , rhubarb and strawberry plants . Jake , with the help of cows , steers , and bulls , provided shoes . There was no point in either if it could n't be sold . Papa and Jake talked of sales . " You got it all over me , Jake , " Papa said . " People come to you for shoes . I 've got to go out and peddle my wares . I 'm just a step ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peddler , " Jake said , " settled down . Pack peddlers did n't manufacture what they sold . Neither do I. " " You 're right about one thing , " Papa admitted . " I like growing more than selling . I do n't know 's I 'd make out very well as a salesmanon the road for someone else 's stuff . " " If people had to depend on me for making shoes , they 'd go barefoot . Selling is all I know how to do , and nowadays I hire others to do even that for me . " Mama and I were clear out of this conversation ; we did n't know anything about selling and did n't want to learn . Wanda , such an early talker , clear beyond words and into sentencesalready , charmed Mama . " It 's the same with some wild flowers , " Mama told me . " They beat anything the seed companies offer . All the seed companies can do is try to make the wild flower bigger and brighter . And Lord knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her in a side show . " Wanda certainly understood none of these words except possibly " big " and " bright , " and these as " big " dog and " bright " fire . Neverthelessshe toddled over into Mama 's lap and said , " Grandma bright . " Mama squeezed her . " It runs in the family , Wanda . " To me she said , " Let Wanda stay with me , Orpha , while you and Jake take a drive . " " Jake does n't mind having her along . He says he 'd always hoped to have a little daughter . " " That 's a good sign in a man . Most men want boys . That meansp154they think the world would be better off with a lot of little duplicatesof themselves running around . A man who wants girls appreciateshis wife . " I did n't repeat Jake 's name ( he was two chairs away from me ) for fear of attracting his attention . " Wife 's ' a word he never uses . Except about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's going to use it . I can tell . And I hope you 've got the good sense to say yes when he does . " " Maybe he wo n't ever say it . He 's had one bad disappointment . " " You , too . You 're both burned children . Do n't you let it keep you out in the cold for the rest of your life . You 'd make a perfect couple . Jake 'll never murder anybody and you 'll never run away . " We were n't a perfect couple , but the last part was true , anyway . Jake never murdered anyone and I never ran away . The first is certainly a virtue . The last is n't . It depends upon what you 've got to run away from . In some cases , running may show good sense and even courage . Mama was right about Jake 's intentions . She kept Wanda , while Jake and I drove north past the tall corn , past tobacco so green it was hard to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of making them into smoking material . I was young enough to like the foretaste of autumn in the air . Now I like spring , with its promise of renewal . Then I welcomed the threat of autumn , with its gales and flurries of snow and chain lightning . Jake may have felt otherwise . We did n't talk about the weather or the seasons . Or even shoes . We talked , to begin with , about Rosa . " I expect you 've heard about my first wife , Rosa . " " I knew you were married . " And I 'd heard more . But I did n't think Jake wanted to talk about Rosa any more than I wanted to talk about Lon . " I was , but it did n't last long . I do n't know anyone who looked more like she would make a good wife than Rosa . She was horn in Germany and came here to live with her uncle . She could bake , churn , make smearcase . She knew just how much starch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedclothes out ome a week to air . "  | " How did you find out all this before you married her ? " " I did n't . " " Why did you marry her then ? " " I married her because she was pretty . " Two beauties . Rosa and Lon . " Why did she marry you ? " I was sorry the minute I said it . sounded as if I meant , " That was n't the reason she married you , If Jake thought that was what I meant , he ignored it . " She ma ried me to get away from her uncle . " " Did n't she think she loved you ? " " I do n't know what she thought . I thought she loved me . Yo would n't do that , would you ? Marry someone you did n't love : I said , " I got married because I was madly in love . That marria did n't pan out very well . " " So you do n't plan to be madly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything like that ? " " Do you plan to marry again ? " " If the right person asks me . Girls do n't do the proposing . " " To your mind , who would be a right person ? " I knew what he wanted me to say : " Someone like you . " I tried t be honest . It did n't have to be Jake . Or even someone like Jak I described a good man . Jake recognized himself . Before you get to the Rush Branch bridge there is , or was , a tun off for swimmers , fishers , or just plain parkers . Jake stopped the c there . Sunday afternoon at the Rush Branch turnoff is no place ft neckers , and I do n't think necking was really what Jake had i mind . What he really wanted to do was talk , but talking did lead t touching , which , with his hands off the wheel , he was free to d , Being touched by Jake Hesse was nothing I 'd ever had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar toucher ; little nips an strokes and pressures . His touching was like that of a machine the has had a specific button pushed . Push the mouth button and mout hunts mouth , takes hold of one corner in a kind of nervous litt ' . nip . Push the hand button and a hand pats a knee , then slides little way up a stocking . ( I had bobbed my hair but I did n't ro my stockings . ) The hand kept moving until it touched bare fleshthe top of my stocking . The hand jerked away then . The han button had been pushed for stocking stroking only , not for an e : ploration of teddies or bloomers . My mind made these calm observations . But my body was mp156calm . I had not been touched by any human hands other than Wanda 's or by any creature more loving than my cat for almost three years . Body did not analyze or label ; it burned and tingled . Body wanted mouth to be really kissed : the whole mouth , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be taken charge of . It was hungry , and while a crumb was better than nothing , a crumb did n't satisfy . Body did n't have teddy boundaries . It continued long after teddy stopped . Body had its eyes closed and could n't see from where the touching was coming . It did n't care . I had done a lot of hugging of Wanda and much stroking of Puss with little response from either . Puss did purr . Wanda sometimes took hold of my finger . But touch was a one-way street with them : I gave , they received . Is there a scarcity of human fondling in the world , considering the appetite for it shown by cat-caressers and baby-huggers ? A slowing car made us sit up straight . When the car was gone , Jake said , " I got carried away . I should have saved that till we were engaged . " I held back a number of replies . " Will you marry me , Orpha ? " Jake asked . " I 'm considerably older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fire . I 've been noticing you ever since the day you rode in to Matthews ' . Well , let 's not talk about that . In fact , ever since you began teaching at Fairmont . I did more than tell the Board you 'd make a good teacher . I told myself you 'd make a good wife . I still think so . Will you marry me , Orpha ? " I certainly intended to say yes . Marriage then was a woman 's vocation . She had only two choices : be an old maid or be a married woman . For a woman , spinsterhood was failure . Old bachelors were n't failures ; all they had to do was ask and they 'd lose their bachelorhood in a minute . A woman could n't ask . An old maid was a failure in the same way that hobos and bums were failures : she was unemployed . Housekeeping , having babies , taking care of a man  --  all this was her profession : a profession she could n't practice without a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was jobless . Most women had always taken for granted that the husband 's work came first . I certainly did . I had no God-given talent except top157make a home comfortable and a husband happy . I had always intended to do that if anyone would give me a chance . And I had learned with Lon that there are better reasons for marriage than a burning desire to throw oneself into somebody 's arms . Love should play some part in the arrangement . The woman could love the idea of marriage , and children , and housekeeping . The man , without any of these , had better love the woman . " There is one word you have n't said , " I told Jake . He knew what it was . He was n't a bold man , and his experience with Rosa had made him cautious . He took a chance . " Orpha , " he said , " I love you . Will you marry me ? " " Yes , " I said , " I will . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brethren Church . It was n't my first marriage , but it was my first wedding . Lon did n't believe preachers had anything to do with a man 's and woman 's decision to live together ; the law , either , for that matter . Our marriage was legal ; a justice of the peace had made us man and wife , but there had been no wedding . The church ritual was better , with its prayers and blessings and tears . I liked saying " in sickness and in health , for better or for worse , until death do us part . " Marriage was my career , Jake was my partner , and God was our witness . For the wedding , Mama had made me and Wanda duplicate dresses of pink organdy . I had never seen Mama happier . Wanda and I were as ruffly as hollyhocks in our our pink dresses . " If only Joe were here to be best man , " Mama said . It was Jake 's place , not Mama 's , to choose the best man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health in a trip . " After the ceremony at the church , Mama had a reception . She had cleaned , baked , and decorated for days . The wedding cake was five tiers high . Jake and I , following the example of couples pictured in the Louisville Courier , cut it , each a hand on the butcher knife Mama had disguised with silver foil . There was fruit punch with sliced bananas floating in it . The paper napkins were decorated with silver wedding bells . If thep158United Brethren ceremony had n't made Jake and me man and wife , Mama 's reception would have . Grace was said before the cake was cut and " God Will Take Care of You " sung before anyone left . It was the practice in those days to abduct the bride , if possible , before the newly married couple left on their honeymoon . Then the groom had to spend his wedding night scouring the countryside searching for his wife . The groom 's car might have the air let out of its tires . The bridal room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the bedsheets be pinned together . We were n't going to a hotel , though I had longed to do so . " It will be more homey just to go to my place , " Jake said . Papa 's Durant , not Jake 's Paige , would be our getaway car ; thus any tampering would be done to the wrong car . I would n't be abducted , because no one would be able to find me . After I went upstairs to change into my " traveling dress , " I would come down the back stairs with Ebon carrying my suitcase . We would run to the toolshed and stay there until Jake , driving the Durant , stopped in front of it for a second . I would then jump in , and the honeymoon would start . Ebon and I made the toolshed without being caught . We left the door slightly open so that we could see Jake approaching . As he came in sight , Ebon gave me a great hug , his long arms crossed tightly over my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too astonished to move . If Ebon had n't pushed me out the door , I might have spent the night of my honeymoon in the toolshed . " Good luck , Orphy , " Ebon said . " I 'll take care of everything . " He threw my suitcase into the back seat , and I climbed into the front with Jake . After the excitement of running and hiding and the unexpected kissing , the ride to Jake 's place was quiet . The calm of marriage had set in . Perhaps there was something to Jake 's belief that his home would be better for a honeymoon than a hotel . Ebon had taken all of my belongings to Jake 's . When we opened the door to the kitchen , there was my cat , purring and rubbing herself about my ankles . It was as if I had never left home.  |p159I  lifted her up and held her close . " Pussy , Pussy , Pussy . " " Where did that cat come from ? " Jake asked . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a long time , Ebon brought her over with the rest of my stuff . " " She 'll have to go to the woodshed . " " She 's housebroken . Leave a window open and she jumps in and out when she needs to . " " Cats smell . I 'll take her out . " " She 's lived in a house with people all of her life . Poor Pussy . " " That 's not a nice name for a girl to use . " " Why not ? It 's just another name for a cat . Like Tabby . " " It 's a name for something else , too . Not a very nice name , either . We 'll rename her . Ma had a cat named Mouser . How aboutMouser ? " " She does n't catch mice . " " Out in the woodshed she will . Here , I 'll take her . " " Let me . You 're a stranger . " On the way to the woodshed I picked up the rag rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch . With it I made a nestin a dip in a rick of wood . " Good-bye , Pussy . This is different , but you 'll be all right . I never leave you . " Inside I said to Jake , " How about Tiger for a name ? She 's got tiger stripes . " " That 's more like it . The name you had for your cat shows what a sweet girl you are . But it would n't do for people to hear my bride saying , Have you seen my pussy ? ' " I did n't know why not , but I had already discovered that Jake had a squeamish streak about words . I was just as ladylike as could be about words myself . I never said belly for stomach , butt f bottom , or puke for throw up . True , there were quite a few wor I did n't know were bad , and these , like pussy , I used freely . I often said of something I did n't like , " That makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , was not nice , either , though did n't tell me why . A woman 's " sick time " is when she " con round , " which means that she is having her menses . So , for a wom to say " That makes me sick " was the same as to say " That makes r menstruate " ; a perfectly normal happening but no more to be m ( tioncd in public than urination . Less to be mentioned , since it , lip160pussy , has to do with sex . Jake asked me to stop saying it , and I , anxious to please , stopped without knowing the real reason . A woman of good sense or spunk would have said to Jake , " What 's wrong with pussy ? What 's wrong with feeling sick ? " A woman with a little knowledge would have known . She would have said to Jake , " Do n't be nasty-nice , Jacob , my boy . You did n't marry your mother . " I was neither knowledgeable nor spunky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't know , did n't find out , went my own but hidden way . Pussy never became Tiger , let alone Mouser , except when Jake was around . She never even learned that Tiger was her name . But let me say , " Pussy , Pussy , " and she came at once . Instead of " That makes me sick , " I learned to say , " I do n't care for that . " What I still felt was sick . So our honeymoon started . Except for Pussy in the woodshed , where , I was afraid , she 'd feel lonesome , and maybe run away , I was n't troubled . My plan was to please my husband . If there were words he did n't like , I would find others . There are thousands of words in the dictionary . My first husband had at least taught me that . Jake carried my suitcase up the stairs . " By rights , " he said , " I should carry the bride . " That was a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do it and we both laughed . " I can walk , " I said , " and the suitcase ca n't . " Mama had made my bridal nightgown out of the finest nainsook . When Papa saw it he said , " You 'll be covered , but not hidden . " When Jake saw it he said , " Before you put that on , I 'd like to see you without it . " When Lon had stripped off his clothes , I had thought , Most men would want to see the girl without her clothes . Now here was a man who did , my newly married husband , and I thought he was strange , too . Perhaps I was the strange one . If the nakedness had come after loving and kissing , with clothes that got in the way thrown off in a hurry , nakedness would have seemed natural , actually necessary . I had recovered from my early training in modesty . Stripping for inspection was , even so , a new experience . I was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ashamed of ' my body . In spite of this , I felt as I imagined a slave on the auction block felt whenp161being inspected by her new owner . Jake had n't even untied his tie yet . He did have his hat off . He sat on the edge of the bed and watched and waited . I paused when I reached the teddy stage . There was n't much left to uncover . What there was , Jake wanted to see . I was willing to show him , though I did n't think that this was the best way to arrive at nakedness on your wedding night . Iwould n't have said to Jake , " Take off your clothes before you go to bed so that I can see you . " Everyone , I was beginning to under- stand , did n't have to be like me . Jake was my husband and hewanted to see me and I had a good body . I took off everything . I stood in front of wallpaper covered with yellow roses that grew over a trellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started in the Garden of Eden and was thus Biblical . Jake looked his fill . Then he said , " You have a body like adancer 's . " That was the first thing I ever wrote in my " Book of Unspoken Thoughts . " Instead of saying to Jake , " What do you know about the bodies ofnaked dancers ? , " I thought it to myself . It did not seem a suitable remark for a wedding night . I got it out of my mind by writing itin my book , which had been intended as a class record book . What I wrote was : The man said to the naked girl , " You have abody like a dancer 's . " A touch would have pleased her more thanthis fabrication . Perhaps it was n't a fabrication . There was a good deal more toJake 's life than I had any idea of at that time . And the truth of the matter was , whether he came by the knowledge through experience or intuition , I was built like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unburdened with a heavy torso ; the stomach concave ; the ribs barely covered ; the breasts not weighted with flesh . I knew more about baseball than ballet then . I was probably shaped as much like a first baseman as a dancer . This was intuition on my part , too , not knowledge . I had never seen a naked first baseman any more than Jake ( I believed ) had seen a naked dancer . I went to bed in the nightgown that covered but did not hide With marriage , Jake had lost courtship 's need to kiss and fondle Marriage had licensed him for more intimate practices . Women born at the turn of the century have been condition not to speak openly of their wedding nights . Of other nights in bedp162with other men they speak not at all . Today a woman having bedded with a great general feels free to tell us that in bed the general could not present arms . Women of my generation would have spared the great general the revelation of this failure ; a failure considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Jake needs no such protection . Setember without teaching was like an autumn when the leaves do n't turn : something wrong somewhere . Before we were married , Jake had asked me to give up my teachingjob at Turkey Creek . It is a slur on a husband 's manhood when his wife is forced to gp out and become a breadwinner . " I like to teach . " ' It would be hard for anyone to believe that a woman would tie herself down to twenty kids five days a week unless she had to . " I promised to send money to Joe . He needs it to go to college . He wants to be a preacher . " Preachers with a call from God do n't need college in order to preach . Prayer and the Bible are all that is needed . " Joe wants to go to college whether or not he preaches . I promised to help him . " There 'll be plenty of money without your going out to earn it . Youu take care of the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets as much as he would from your teaching . " The house did n't take much care . Jake had left in his house in Cincinnati all of the furnishings and most of the keepsakes of his days , first , with his mother , then with Rosa . Cincinnati was the center of his business , and he went there five days out of every week . When he was there , he stayed in the old home . It served him as an office as well as a place to sleep . He was building a new shoe store in Louisville , and the man who would manage it , together with the Piqua and Cincinnati managers , met there to discuss business and lau plans . I had looked forward to going to Cincinnati , a great city , the " River Queen . " Although I had visited it once , as a child , and re/membered the zoo , I had only heard of its shops , its libraries and lyceums , of its ships on the river . Jake said no . His days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hardship for Wanda . Ile wanted me to establish us firmly in Amesville : join clubs , go to and give parties , attend church . Bridge clubs were fashionable in Amesville . For married couples , these met at night after the men were home from work ; women played bridge in the afternoon . Before the game they sat down to an elaborate luncheon served on card tables covered with a cloth heavy with Madeira embroidery . As the new Mrs. Hesse , wife of the shoe merchant well known in two states and about to branch out into a third , I was asked at once to join the Thursday Afternoon Bridge Club . I no longer believed that card-playing was wicked ; and after a summer of five hundred , bridge was just more of the same . The second time I played , I won first prize , a framed reproduction of Maxfield Parrish 's " September Morn . The problem for me was not the game itself , but what preceded it  --  the luncheon . I could cook for harvesters , church suppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether I would ever be able to cook a bridge luncheon , I did n't know . The first one I ever ate awed me . This was the menu : 1 . An unknown mixture in a shell too small for an abalone , too large for a clam. 2 . Two hollow globes called " pules . " These globes were colored blue and yellow and were the texture of coarse potato chips . They did not taste like potato chips , but like pasteboard lightly seasoned. 3 . A large green dill pickle. 4 . At each plate , a slice of blue-and-yellow bread. 5 . Lemon-yellow ice cream , topped with whipped cream colored blue. 6 . Small cakes shaped like hearts , diamonds , clubs , and spades . Hearts and diamonds were yellow ; clubs and spades were blue . ( Blue and yellow were the colors of Amesville High School , and the footballseason was just beginning . ) Jake was proud of inc for winning first prize . When I said I would never be able to produce a prize-winning luncheon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club lady in Amesvillc can make , I can buyp164at a delicatessen in Cincinnati . I never heard of a puffle and from what you say I never want to eat one . But if puffles are what the ladies of Amesville want , Cincinnati can produce them . " In my Book of Unspoken Thoughts , I listed Jake 's virtues . Why were n't they spoken ? Because they were arguments I needed to remindmyself that I had married wisely . Spoken , I was afraid Jake might understand their purpose and my need for remembering them. 1 . Jake is generous . He was . He would bring home anything I needed from Cincinnati for my bridge parties . He sent twenty-five dollars a month without fail to Joe . He doted on Wanda . ( Mother kept her for the first two weeks we were married . ) He spoiled her . It was Christmas for her almost every time Jake came home from the city ; she cried if he came home without a gift  --  a doll or a teddy bear or a ball with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other women had their household accounts checked , were without pocket money exceptfrom the sale of their own butter and eggs . Not so for me . True , Jake had money , but rich men can be closefisted , too , with wives. 2 . Jake is not jealous . When Jake saw that I missed my teaching and missed the nights of study to which I had been accustomed with Lon , he suggested that Ebon come over once a week for what Jake called " classwork . " With no known reason for jealousy , I had burned with anger when Lon let Ebon become a part of our evenings of study . Are you jealous because you believe others capable of your own infidelities ? Does a lack of jealousy mean a lack of imagination ? A lack of love ? Do love and jealousy go together ? I did n't know. 3 . Jake is hard-working and successful. 4 . Jake is clean and tidy. 5 . Jake does not drink or gamble. 6 . Jake is a faithful husband . All these , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't spoken because each was only one-half of a sentence . The whole sentences would have been : " Even though Jake put Pussy'sp165kittens in a gunnysack and killed them by shooting into the sack with a shotgun , he is generous , faithful , clean , hard-working , etc . " Even though Jake took my book on socialism and burned it in the cookstove because it preached revolution , he is generous , clean , faithful , hard-working , etc . " Even though Jake will not let me say that anything makes me feel sick , ' when I really am sick he does then exactly what he does when I 'm well ; yet he is nevertheless generous , sober , hard-working , etc . " Even though Jake hoots at Joe 's letters and says Joe is either out of his mind or fishing for money , he is generous , hard-working , sober , etc . " The killing of the kittens was in some ways the worst . Pussy would have gone , too , if I had n't rescued her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes were open . Pussy 's five were four months old and at their most playful and cuddlesome . Jake said that in the mix-up of grabbing kittens and stuffing them into the sack , he had mistakenly grabbed Pussy , too . Perhaps . Suspicious , Pussy leaped out ; I held her and saved her . There was a lot of bloodshed and a lot of cat-screaming . When the sack no longer moved , Jake opened it : four dead kittens and one unwounded , but dazed . Since this kitten was a male , Jake said , " It 's the law . Even a criminal do n't have to suffer double jeopardy . " So Pussy had one kitten left to console her . The kitten could n't be consoled . The shooting had permanently frightened him . We called him Crazy Cat , and he lived for a long time , always fearful , jumping out of his skin when a door banged . The book-burning was in its way like the cat-killing , with this exception : a duplicate of a book can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I valued the burned book especially because it had come from Joe . Joe would have laughed at that . A book 's value lies in its words , not in the hands that may have touched it . I was able to get another copy of Spargo 's Socialism through Tom O'Hara , then the manager of Jake 's store in Cincinnati . When the new store in Louisville opened , O'Hara was to manage it . He came down to Amesville so that he and Jake could ride to Louisville together ; when he did this , he stayed overnight at our house.  |p166O'Hara  was a big black Irishman . He looked more like a man to put shoes on horses than on ladies . The ladies , however , according to Jake , doted on being shod by Tom . They would buy more pairs of shoes than they needed simply for the pleasure of having Tom at their feet tickling their toes now and then as well as praising their high insteps and slender ankles . Tom was a free-talking , hearty , laughing man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tom as Grandfather had been with Toss ; as if each man found in the other a hidden opposite he admired but had never been able to expose in himself . I asked Tom if he would buy me Spargo 's book in a Cincinnati bookstore and bring it to me in a plain wrapper . Tom , who did n't know any more about socialism than Wanda , said , " Reading dirty books , eh , and trying to keep it secret ? " " Socialism is n't dirty . It 's politics . " " What 's the difference ? " " Socialism is against dirty politics . " " It 's against Republicans then ? " Tom was a Catholic and a Democrat . " Republicans and Democrats . " " Jake 's not going to like it . " " That 's why I 'm asking you to buy it . That 's why the plain wrapper . " " Well , you 're free , white , and twenty-one . " Tom brought me the book , and I kept it , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had been two-faced only in thoughts . Now I became two-faced in deeds as well . Jake paid no attention to our " class meetings " ; he read the paper for half an hour after supper , then went to bed . Toni , if he happened to be at our house when Ebon was there , attended the class meeting for a while , laughed his head off when he saw that Ebon and I were studying the forbidden book . He usually ended up playing with Wanda instead of listening to us . Wanda , who could talk at one , could converse at three . " She makes more sense than you two , " Tom told us . " Do n't you , Wanda ? " " What 's sense ? " asked Wanda . " I can make cookies . " " You 're my cookie , " Tom said . Tom , at thirty-four , had four children of his own and knew how to toss them in the air , swing them between his knees , and let them climb from his ankles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . He never brought Wanda a present , not even a sucker ; and Wanda , who always met Jake at the door crying , " Where 's my present , Papa ? , " met Tom crying , " Let me climb . " Tom told jokes and used words Jake would n't have tolerated in anyone else . To me once , after Jake was in bed , he told of a strange man he had met in Louisville . This man went about the streets of Louisville , where there were still a good many horses at the hitching racks , trying to find a horse who would lick the palm of his hand . " Did he put something on his palm the horse would like ? " " No . He did n't think that would be fair . He had to find a horse who would lick his hand of its own free will . " " Why did he want his hand licked ? Free will or no free will . " " It was the only way he could have an orgasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't try to find out from Tom . Either it was something I would appear stupid not to know , or it was something so far over my head I would n't understand if it was explained to me . I did look up the word in my little dictionary , but it was n't there . I wrote it lightly in pencil on the flyleaf . Lon had taught me to look up every word I did n't know . I wanted to remember to look up this one when I had the use of a bigger dictionary . If I had known what it meant , I would never have written that word any place where Jake would see it . Jake opened my dictionary and saw that word in my handwriting . In my opinion he looked up the word himself in some big dictionary before he spoke to me about it . Where on a backwoods farm or even in a big-city shoe store would you run into a word like that ? O'Hara would , yes . He was an Irishman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up burrs . He even knew Indian words , and there had n't been an Indian in Bigger Township for a hundred years . Jake brought me my dictionary one evening after I had finished the supper dishes and he had finished the Courier . He opened the dictionary ; then , like a prosecuting attorney , asked me , " Orpha , is this your handwriting ? " " Of course it is . " " Why were you writing a word like that ? " " I was writing it so I would n't forget to look it up . I did n't know what it meant . " " Where did you read that word ? " " I did n't read it . I heard it . "  | " Who said it ? " " Mr. O'Hara . " " How did he happen to be using a word like that to you ? " " It was in a story he told . " " What was the story ? " I told him . Jake said , " O'Hara is a loose talker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole , outer sole , heel and tongue . But he was brought up in shantytown and never learned that there are some words you do n't use to ladies . " " What does it mean ? " " Nothing a well-brought-up young woman needs to know . " " Is it dirty ? " " It 's not a word you 'll ever need to use . " Jake tore the page out of the dictionary , crumpled it , and handed it to me . The word by that time was so fixed in my mind that there was no need to have it written anyplace in order for me to remember it . I lifted the stove lid and dropped the page onto the still-live coals . " Good girl , " Jake said . " That 's where it belongs . " Orgasm went to join socialism , Pussy , and " feel sick . " Bad words , bad books , doomed kittens . Strange bridge parties , Unspoken Thoughts , bobbed hair disguised with false ! Wifehood was my profession , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than teaching or farming or carpentry . Dead cats , crazy cats , puffles , bad word , Unspoken Thoughts , " sick times " ignored . So what ? Look what I have , I told myself . Wanda , a human talking doll . Pussy , a piece of purring fur . Class meetings , with Nettie present now . Teaching a Sunday-school class instead of schoolteaching ; miracles instead of fractions and current events . Letters from Joe , each one a psalm . My parents , proud . Rob me of all of these and I was still twenty-five and living in a bower . Jake , because his farm was rolling , grew apples , not corn , tobacco , or timothy . Apple blossoms beat roses and lilies . You look up to apple blossoms and what is overhead beats any beauty underfoot . My memory magnet , which did n't attract shoes , attracted and held onto the names of apples : Grimes Golden , Maiden Blush , SummerSweeting , Golden Delicious , Rome Beauty , Early Harvest , Northern Spy.  |p169Most  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al Wanda and I picked up the windfalls . We made apple butter in copper kettle in the back yard , jelly and sauce in the kitchen . I say " we " because Wanda , in addition to learning to use he tongue early , had early control of her hands . At a time when mo children are still fumbling with their spoons and upsetting the mush and milk , Wanda could peel and core an apple . Once , when I was upstairs trying to sleep off a headache , Wanc started supper . She cooked dried apples that had been set aside fc the pigs because they were wormy . Jake doted on Wanda so muc that he had a spoonful or two of her applesauce , afloat though it we with worm grease . I would n't do that . How would a child ever lear to inspect dried apples before cooking if people ate what was cooker worms and all ? " A worm is meat , " said Jake , " like a pig . Just a different shapeA woman who keeps house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who digs ditches . A woman who paints the picture of a room is an artist and admired . I with my broom , Wanda with her dustcloth , working o a level with the rungs of chairs , made the picture of a room moi real than anything on canvas . A woman who dances is admired . Wanda and I moved like dan ers , brought in the wood , took out the slop , ran down the stai with the dirty bedding , ran up the stairs with the clean . Dancing and picture-making went on there every day . The phon graph played " The Stars and Stripes Forever . " That was good mus for broom strokes and dancing trips upstairs and down . Nettie Mozier , eighteen now , looking like Wanda 's big sistc Kickapoos both , continued coming to the class meetings . Ebon like her , Jake did n't . " She 's headed for trouble , " Jake said . " Why do you attract 2 these peculiar women ? " There was nothing peculiar about Nettie , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was n't afraid to talk bal to Jake . " What 's peculiar about Nettie ? " " Somebody 'll take advantage of her . " " That wo n't be our responsibility . "  | " It will if she 's here . " " I trust you and Ebon . " Jake did n't think that was funny . Mrs. Harriman came over late one afternoon before a class meetingstarted . I had n't seen her since Fairmont days . She was still , for me , the mother of George and Thomas and the woman who had defended me as a teacher . I supposed that she wanted to talk teaching . She did n't . What she wanted to tell me was about her health . Jake and Tom O'Hara were both there . I talked to Mrs. Harriman in the kitchen ; they were in the sitting room . The door between the two rooms was left open . This did n't bother Mrs. Harriman . She was too concerned with her own trouble . She unbuttoned her dress and showed me a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a crater . At the breast 's outer edge was a raw spot , something like a boil that has been lanced or an abcess building toward draining . " Ai n't that an awful sight ? If it ai n't cancer , I 'm a rich woman . If it starts to run , I 'll live in the barn . I wo n't have George or Tom catching it . I 'm so careful . I do n't let them eat from anything I 've touched . I do n't get near them . I do n't let them catch my breath . " At that moment Jake shut the door between the two rooms with a bang . Mrs. Harriman did n't even notice its closing . It was Mrs. Harriman 's outburst that made Jake touchy about the class meeting that night . Nettie , whose father had driven her over , hoped to be taken home by Ebon . Ebon could n't take her because he had come over on horseback . They could have ridden double , would have , except that Tom O'Hara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard on the horse , " he told Nettie , " and a long bone breaker for you . " " Are you sure it wo n't be a bother for you ? " Nettie asked . " Be a pleasure , " Tom said . Jake was sure this would be true  --  and double . He took me to one side . Before he told me what he had in mind , he scolded me for leaving the door open while Mrs. Harriman talked . " There she was , naked from the waist up and talking about a pretty nasty disease . And neither of you cared that the door was open so two men could see and hear all that went on . "  | " She did n't even know you were there . " " You did . " " I could n't leave her while she was telling me something so sad . " " O.K. You did what you had to do . Now we 've got someone else on our hands who needs looking after  --  Nettie . " " What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with O'Hara . " " What can we do ? Ask her to stay the night ? " " No , no . You just go along as chaperone . Tom 'll behave himself with you along . " " Maybe he wo n't want me along . " " Do n't ask him what he wants . Just go . " So I just went . Nettie did n't mind . Ebon was the one she had her eye on , and with the slightest encouragement from him she would have straddled old Mouse behind him . If Tom minded my presence , he did n't show it . Until we got rid of Nettie , it seemed that Jake was completelywrong in his opinion of Tom : not a misbehaving word or gesture . After that , it was misbehavior all the way . If I had been in love with Tom O'Hara or longing for his touch , I did n't know it . I was married . If marriage was a cage , I had enteredit with my eyes open . It was where I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Tom had n't come along , and someone like Jake had n't opened the door and given me a shove , I would never have ventured outside . My Unspoken Thoughts had been my mind 's work , I believed ; I did n't recognize them as my body speaking . Jake 's name , though many thoughts were in one way or another about him , rarely appeared . I had that much delicacy  --  or slyness . No one reading them , not even Jake , would suspect that he was their subject . So I thought . It is a waste of life , I wrote , trying to teach a turnip to bleed . The life you live contradicts the one you desire but do n't approve . To live with someone you do n't love , quietly , unflinchingly , is tolive a slave 's life . Out of that endurance comes a slave 's strength.  |p172Beneath  the assumption that marriage is for all time , the unconsciousdream life flourishes . Why do men who eat cows condemn cats who eat birds ? She awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature protects you . What you ca n't get , you cease to be capable of enjoying . Womanliness makes a good man better but a bad man worse . Her spirit was so disassociated from her body that her body 's use or misuse meant little . Once , the two had been identified . Then spirit had kept up a constant clamor , an endless plaintive " no . " Body was silent ; made no unseemly sounds : mouth closed , jaws set , eyes shut . From beneath the closed eyelids tears flowed . Body and spirit in time took up their abode in different lands . Or if the same land , it was a realm of an indifference so great it could not be told from death . The harvest of hazarding less than all is nothing . To be left is fate and bearable ; to leave is decision and unbearable . Hope is a killer . I did not know that in my Book of Unspoken Thoughts I was doing more than recording opinions ; that I was prophesying acts . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking in words the ear could not hear . After we turned homeward , Nettie safely delivered , Tom said to me , " Well , take it off , kid . " When I heard that I thought , Jake knew what he was talking about . " Take off what ? " " Your shoes , of course . Just because I 'm a shoe salesman does n't mean you ca n't be comfortable . " " I 'm used to wearing shoes . " " You poor kid . Do n't anybody ever pull your leg ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Your hair , your hair . Take off that mess of false hair . What 're you hiding , anyway ? " " I 'm hiding my bobbed hair . " " What for ? It 's the style now . "  | " Jake does n't like it . " " Why ? " " He thinks it looks cheap . " " Nuns have short hair . What 's cheap about a nun ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake do n't want you to act like a nun , does he ? " That was n't a question I thought I should answer . " How do you make it stick on ? " Tom asked . " Rubber bands . " Tom reached over , ran his fingers under my Psyche knot , gave firm tug , and had my false hair in his hand . " That 's a hundred percent better . What the hell makes you wan to tie that wad at the back of your neck ? " " I told you . Jake does n't like short hair . " " Did n't he ever see you like this ? " Tom ran his hand through my short hair . " Of course . That 's why he bought me the switch . " " What do you do at night ? " " I sleep with it on . " " My God ! Do n't it ever come loose ? " " No . " " Do n't you like short hair ? " " Of course I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you try to hide it then ? " " I told you that already , twice . To please Jake . " " Did you ever think of letting him try to please you ? " " What makes you think he does n't ? " " I 've known Jake a lot longer than you have . " " You 've never been married to him . " " Thank God , no . I work for him , though . Same as you do . " " Do n't run down my husband . " " Here 's your switch . Pin it back on . Be Jake 's old lady again . " I do n't have to when Jake 's not around . " " What are you when Jake 's not around ? " " A flapper , I guess . " " Hey , hey . You had me fooled . I thought you were old Mr , Prim , the ex-schoolteacher . " " Toni ran his hand through my short hair again , softly , the wa I smoothed Wanda 's black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at suppwrtime . Ile clipped the palm of his hand across thp174curve of my skull the way I cupped Pussy 's head . His hand was big enough to make me feel that I was a pet he was caressing , little , furry , and lovable . " You 've got a nice-shaped head . " " Same as everybody else 's . " " You a head feeler ? " " No . " " They ai n't all the same . Some people got heads like marbles . Some people got heads the shape of ironing boards . " " What 's mine like ? " " A greengage plum . Swell out , curve in . " " Wonder what Jake would think if I shaved my head ? " " He would n't like it . What 'd you pin your switch to ? Say , I ca n't talk and drive . I got a one-track mind . " He pulled off into the lane of the Grigsbys ' old abandoned log house . " I 've got to get home to Wanda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He 's home , but he 's asleep by now . " " You spoil that child . You ought to have another , for her sake . " " I 'd like to . " " What 's to hinder ? " " I do n't know . I went to a doctor to find out . " " What 'd he say ? " " Send in your husband . ' " " What 'd he tell Jake ? " " Jake wo n't go . " " What 's wrong with Jake ? " " Nothing that I know of . He thinks examinations like that are kind of indecent . " " What 'd he think about you going ? " " He says it 's different for women . They have children and female diseases and are used to having doctors examine them . They do n't get embarrassed as easy as a man . " " Is that a fact ? " " It embarrassed me . " " Say , let 's cut this out . I talk to Jake three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about him . " " You asked the questions . " " It was a mistake . You should 've told me to shut up . Look , you'rep175no kid . You 're a grown-up twice-married woman . Papa wo n't spank if you bob your hair . Or tell some nosy guy it 's none of his business if he asks you a question you do n't want to answer . " " What do you think 's wrong with me ? " " Only one thing , as far as I know . And that 's on a subject I decided not to talk about any more . Decided not to talk at all , as a matter of fact . " And he did n't . I 'm not sure whether or not he was absolutely silent . There was certainly no conversation . The sound I heard was perhaps only the blood pounding in my ears ; it was like a stream flowing , or leaves blowing . Tom was n't a man who started out with an ear , in a hunt for other openings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area that provided the greatest response . He was like a man loving , and his loving was a gettingacquainted . It was his arms and mouth saying , " Hello . How are you ? " I was fine . I was learning . Every thought whispered , " Wrong . Forbidden . Unfaithful . Wicked . Cheap . Disgraceful . " Every vein , nerve , muscle shouted , " Hallelujah . Glory be to God in the highest . " My eyes were shut , but here were no tears . My mouth was not closed , but smiling . We do n't live by heart thumps , nerve thrips , or muscle contractions . That 's the life of animals , and we left that behind when we began to speak . We live by words and sentences now . They 're what we developed as we hunted for labels to put on the thrips and the thumps and the spasms . Tried to discriminate , actually . So where was I going ? Back to the animals ? It seemed more like back to Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , there was no adultery , the Biblical word for the spasms that is theft as well as retreat from the word to the wordless . What happened to inc could have happened to Wanda and no one would have been arrested for child abuse . What 's the opposite of abuse ? Delectation ? Is woman-delectation a crime ? If you listen to the words , yes . Outsideof marriage at that time and in that neighborhood , it was . And I knew it . If you listen to your body , " Grace abounding " was what it said . We were home by eleven . Tom , who was spending the night at our place , paused before going into the house . " You know this is just the beginning , " he said . I did , but I did n't answer.  |p176Tom  handed me my switch . " Why do n't you leave this off ? " I did n't answer that , either . I went to the woodshed first , where Pussy continued to sleep . She had poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every night to see if she was safe . I went that night to stroke her , to say , when she purred , " Are you happy ? " I went to Wanda 's room , more than once most nights : not that she ever needed anything ; she slept as unmoving as a wooden Indian . I went just for the delight of her black hair against the white pillow and the neat little mound of her four-year-old body lifting the covers . I turned a cover down or pulled it up and had a mothering do-gooder 's satisfaction . That night , selfish with my own happiness , I could n't resist patting as well as rearranging . Wanda opened her eyes . " You 've got your short hair on , Mama . " " Sometimes I like to wear it . Go back to sleep . " She did n't need to be told . She slept . When I went into Jake 's and my room , I had thought that I would do what Tom had suggested  --  become what I truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my switch on the dresser , put my nightgown on my body . I took two steps toward the bed . Then I went back and once again anchored the false hair to my own stubby ponytail . Thus disguised , I was ready for bed.  |p179Hemingway  had not yet said , " If it feels good , it is good . " Or if he had , I did n't know it . When Sir Thomas More had his head cut off , that surely did n't feel good . Sir Thomas chose an agony rather than endure the lifelong heartache of knowing that he had preferred whatfelt good rather than what was good . Or what he believed to begood ; which is all we can know about the good anyway . It was with Wanda , not Jake , that I felt the burden of my guilt most strongly . With Wanda I dealt in words . " Wanda , you must not tell stories . " " Wanda , if you make a promise , you must keep that promise . ' ' " Wanda , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What kind of a mother was I , liar , promise-breaker , Ten Com- mandment  --  defier , talking thus to a child of four ? I was a whitedsepulchre . A Judas-kisser . Surely Wanda , who was not easily fooled , would detect my falseness and be harmed by it . With Jake , there were no false words . There did not have to be . If I had said , " Jake , I lie , break promises , do not keep the Com- ntandments , " he would not have believed me . Not because Jake thought me to be a saint but because I was his wife . And because nothing had changed in our relationship . False hair firmly anchored , I went to bed with him as usual . What happened there had notchanged because of Tom . I was not capable of what young people today apparently find possible : simultaneous sexual relationships of feeling with more than one person . Are they wrong today , ane was I right ? I doubt it . Both quite likely wrong ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfaithful . Jake detected some change in me . I was merrier , less resentful ofthe bridge luncheons , more and more knowledgeable about shoes , less despondent about not teaching , less dependent on class meetings . " Nothing is more satisfying to a than , " Jake told me , " than to hear his wife laughing and humming around the house . "  |p180I  was laughing and humming . That was true . Tom was the cause of the laughing and Ebon 's singing had taught me tunes to hum . Jake considered himself the source of all these happy sounds . Jake , though I did n't know it then , was in great need of such a belief . I tried to let him keep it . So Jake was happy . I was happy . Tom was happy . I was n't first with Tom , never would be . Because of him , I did laugh and sing . Laughing and singing are n't marriage , however , and Jake had married me . Marriage is sometimes glum but it is a habitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the void , not even a window to issue from and be shaped by . " Well , kiddo , we are going to Cincinnati today , " Tom said . I loved that " kiddo . " I was twenty-five years old . ( I loved the first time I was called " baby , " when I was forty . Is there a baby in all of us , or just in women , that never grows up ? Or at least never wants to . ) " I ca n't go . Jake does n't like women who go skylarking off to shop and see movies . " " I promise you  --  no shopping , no movies . " " I promised Jake . " " I did n't know that cut much ice with you . " " Oh , Tom . It 's because I break the big promises , I have to keep the little ones . " " I know that , kiddo . This wo n't hurt Jake . He 's in Louisville for two days . I expected to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back in the store . " " Who 'll feed ? " " We 'll be back in time . Late , but in time . " " What 'll we do with Wanda ? " " Take her . " " Jake says the city is hard on children . " " Horsefeathers ! Wanda could go to the North Pole , and you know it , and never turn a hair . " " What if Jake comes home and I 'm gone ? " " Jake 'll find excuses for anything you do . " " You think he loves me that much ? "  | " Hell , no . Jake loves Jake . He 'll hit upon some explanation that does n't hurt him . " " What about your wife ? " " What about Nora ? " " What if she sees you wandering about town with some strange woman ? " " We are n't going to be wandering . " So we went . It was May , The rolling hills were like green cushions . They were embroidered with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and through the woods , to Grandfather'shouse we go . " Ebon had taught her that . Tom sang " Galway Bay . " His mother had taught him . Everyone could sing but me . I could hug , I was in the middle ; Tom , as big as a barrel , Wanda , as slender as if she had taken her name from a wand . And I could laugh . I never understood it . The idea of disobeying Jake , of deceiving him , made me unhappy . The fact made me happy . On that ride to Cincinnati , Jake never entered my mind . I was a woman ( at twentyfive , youth , I supposed , had ended ) with a man and a child I loved to be with . I had given up trying to define love . " Love to be with " did n't need definition . It was demonstrable . " I have to go to the store for a while , " Tom said . " I 'll leave you and Wanda off at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to be left off at a friend 's . I wanted still less to go to the store . In Cincinnati , fifty years ago , as almost everywhere else , the mansions were on high ground , the houses with geraniums and porch swings were on the flats . Tom stopped in front of a house with geraniums and a porch swing , neat , white , but squeezed in between two houses that were duplicates . " They 're expecting you , " he said . I wanted to be introduced , explained , apologized for . A lady came onto the porch . Tom called to her , " Here they are , Nora . " To me he said , " Hop out , kiddo . Everything will be all right . I 'll pick you up in a couple of hours . " I did n't hop . Wanda did . I climbed out slowly and watched Tom speed away . Then I turned to look at Nora . She had come off thep182porch to the sidewalk where I stood . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have guessed she was Swedish , a milk-blond with pale freckles and a great mound of hair , more carrot than red . I was wearing my natural short hair . Nora made me see why Jake liked long hair . It was , for a woman , the difference between being crowned and uncrowned . " Hello , Wanda , " she said . For Wanda , Nora was a woman with a porch swing . " Can I sit in your swing ? " " Sit and swing . That 's what it 's for . Come on in , " she said to me . I was trying to make up my mind whether to stay or run . I was brought up with jealousy . I had experienced jealousy . I was reacting as I would if Lon , or even Jake , had dumped on me a woman I knew as much about as Nora evidently knew about me . I might not do it , but what I would like to do would be : hit her . " Come on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must be hungry . " I still had not been able to move , or say a word . Nora was a woman I had wronged . I was more at ease with those I thought had wronged me . I knew how to be a victim . Maybe I wanted to be a victim . Can we , by our thoughts and emotions , shape our own faces ? What would a face whose owner had never felt vindictive , cruel , greedy , hateful , jealous , be ? Even in a town as small as Amesville , the faces I saw on the street when I was a child sometimes frightened me . Once  --  in the courthouse when Lon and I were getting our marriage license  --  I did see an elderly man and woman whose faces were transfigured with purity . Nora 's face , because she was younger , was even more startlingly pure . Age , with its ivory skin , white hair , and frail bones , appears to have shed all baseness . Nora 's skin was not white ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vividly colored : coral lips , carrot hair , and eyes so blue and open to inspection you could take a baptism of trust there more easily than the United Brethren provided in branch water . Her face had never been twisted by hatred or jealousy or cruelty . I was more afraid of going into the house with her than I would have been with a woman who had an inclination to strike . With such a woman I could have held my own.  |p183Wanda  was already swinging . " Come on in , " Nora urged . Inside the house were four children and two dozen objects I could less accurately name . They had to do , I knew , with the rituals and beliefs of the Roman Catholic church : crucifixes , votive lights , crosses , candles , pictures of Jesus and His mother . These were not strewn around helter-skelter , but neatly placed . The effect was ecclesiastical and tidy . Nora introduced me to , or , rather , told me the names of , her children . The oldest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five , Theresa , three , and Peter was two . Mary Frances was carrying Peter . Peter had the most completely crossed eyes of any human being I had ever seen . It made my eyes hurt to look at him . " The children have been fed , " Nora said . " I 'll give Wanda a sandwich and they can all go outside and play . You 'd like that , would n't you , Wanda ? " " Yes , " said Wanda , who had come indoors after us . " What 's wrong with your baby 's eyes ? " " They 're crossed . " " Can he see ? " " He can see . Now all of you run outside . We want to talk . " They wanted to run outside , and did . I , still wordless , was left to talk . All that I could think to say was , " I am sorry . I have wronged you . I have broken the Commandments . I will never see Tom again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table with what was almost a bridge-luncheon meal . Waldorf salad decorated with halves of English walnuts , home-baked bread cut into triangles but , thank goodness , uncolored . Also tea , which was then considered festive and which for politeness 's sake I drank . " You noticed Peter 's eyes , did n't you ? " " Yes , I did . " " They 're terrible , are n't they ? " " It 's too bad ; he 's such a nice-looking little boy . " " I caused it . " " How could you do that ? " " I tried not to have him . " " Abortion " was not a word I knew then . But I did know that women who found themselves pregnant and did n't want a childp184took castor oil and pushed sharp implements into their wombs in an effort to dislodge the unwanted child . No one with a face like Nora 's could possibly have done such a thing . She had n't . " I think it is wrong to do what causes children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act for . " " Some people do n't , think it 's wrong . " " I do . I had my first three children so close together . Then I listened to someone I should n't have . She said a douche of half icecoldwater and half vinegar would kill the sperm before it got to the egg . So that 's what I did . " " That must have been painful . " " I wish it had hurt more . Then I would have stopped . It kept on . And you saw the result . The sperm was n't killed but it was damaged . And the baby that came from it was damaged . Do n't those eyes look as if poor little Pete had just had a slosh of ice-cold vinegarwaterin his face . That would make your eyes cross , would n't it ? " " It would just make me shut them , I think . " " In the womb it would be different . Now I am never again going to use anything to stop a baby from coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do what makes a baby , then say to the baby , You ca n't live . ' That 's murder . " " So you are n't going to have a lot more babies ? " " No . I will never do anything to have a baby again . I like babies . I never liked what you had to do to get one . I have stopped doing it . " " What is Tom going to do about that ? " " You know what he is doing . " " Do n't you think he is wrong ? " " It is n't murder . " " What if I had a baby ? " " You wo n't . You 've had two husbands and no baby . You wo n't change . " " The doctor said there was nothing wrong with me . " " Doctors tell women what they want to hear . " " I 'll promise never to see Tom again if you ask me to . " " What good would that do ? Tom 's a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a baby or whose husband would shoot him . Tom 's a good husband . He loves the children , he 's a good provider . That one ugly little act . I do n't like it and men have to have it . It 's wrong , but , with you , no child 's being murdered . And Jake do n't object . "  | " Jake does n't know anything about it or he would object . " " He would n't have any right to . " " I do n't know what you mean . " " Of course you do . You know Tom and you know Jake . " " You do n't know Jake . " " Tom does . " " Just because Tom 's not a true husband does n't mean that Jake 's like him . " " That 's not what I meant . That 's not what Tom said . Look , I asked you here to make you feel better , not worse . I do n't think what Tom 's doing is right . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He do n't have a priest 's control . But what he 's doing is n't against anyone 's will . Some women are almost like men that way . I 'm not . God made us all different . No baby is deformed or dying by any act of Tom 's . He makes you happy . If I was Jake 's wife and a different stripe , I might think Tom was a treat , too . " " Look , " I said , " you talk about your husband and I 'll talk about mine . " " Tom said you grieved because of me and the children . I did n't want you to grieve for that reason . " I could n't say , " Thank you for your thoughtfulness . " I would prefer grieving to thinking that I should be thanked for an " ugly little act " that Tom had to have ; and which , while wrong , was at least better for him to do with me than with almost anyone else . I could stand the idea of sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being some kind of good-hearted nursemaid to nastiness . Nora saw that she had n't made me any happier . " You have n't taken him away from us , you know . " " I know that . " " After your first husband , who was a murderer , then next Jake , who  --  " " Let 's not talk about Jake . " " I could tell you  --  " " I do n't want to hear . " " Let 's play with the children , then . All I wanted to do was to make you feel better . " I think that was true . That pure face belonged to someone untroubledby seeing more than one side of any situation . She thought Tom and I were wicked  --  I thought so thyself  --  hut I was not top186worry about her . Worry about God . God would be displeased . She was n't . Tom 's and my sin , that " ugly little act , " prevented a greater sin ; and it also excused her from something she detested . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention , but , as the result of her talk , I doubted that Tom would ever look the same to me again . " You have n't eaten more than one bite , " Nora said . " I have n't much appetite . " " Let 's call in the kids . They 'll clear up the leftovers in a hurry . And cheer us up , too . " They did both . There was n't a scrap left on the table when a car stopped in front of the house and Tom himself banged open the screen door . " Oh , God , " he said , " he did it , he did it . " There were tears on his face . He grabbed up two of the children , cross-eyed Pete and Wanda , and danced around the room , saying over and over , " By God , he did it . " " Do n't curse , Tom , " Nora said . " I 'm not cursing , Nora . I 'm praising God . " " What did God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindbergh flew all the way across the ocean alone . " " With wings ? Like a bird ? " asked Wanda . " Like a bird , but in a flying machine . " " What 's a flying machine ? " " It 's a machine . With an engine like an automobile , but it travels through the air , not on a road . " Tom put the children down and faced us , still seated at the table . " How can you sit there ? Do n't you know what this means ? " " It 's just fast travel , is n't it ? " Nora asked . " Oh , God , " said Tom again . " Thank God you 're not in Paris greeting Lindbergh . Yeh , it was fast travel , all right . But look who did it ! A kid all alone . If his engine went bad , he 'd be down in the water without a thing to mark the spot . " " Would he drown ? " asked Wanda . " Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For God 's sake , let 's have a little rejoicing around here . " Nora lit the candles and knelt with her children . Tom tried to hold back tears . I looked on . Wanda knelt with the other children and clasped her hands . " Thank thee , God , for taking care of Lindy. "  |p187Where  she got the Lindy , I do n't know . The crossing herself and kneeling when candles were lit she picked up then and there . She could be a hundred-percent Kickapoo , I thought , in touch with something we had lost . The ride back to Amesville was quiet . I sat as far to my side of the seat as I could . Wanda was in the middle . Tom gave his whole attention to driving . I was disgusted with both Tom and me . We had been romantic lovers , sinning , yes . Nora had taken away both the romance and the sin . Nora had hinted that , if there had been any desire on my part to punish Jake , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine . " Some women are that way , too . " Back to army mule again . Tom was mad at me because I had been unresponsive to what had moved him so much . I had n't been unresponsive to Tom or his tears . A man who ca n't cry is only half human . If we had been alone , I would have spoken . How speak in the midst of children , lighted candles ? Or stunned as I was by Nora 's offer of friendship ; and her reasons for the offer . Tom went forty miles an hour most of the time , as if his one wish was to get rid of me as soon as possible . The door handle I was shoved against put a dent in me that showed a bruise next day . Wanda was the only one not depressed . " Will Lindy fly home again ? " she asked . " No , " Tom said . " Why not ? " " It 's too dangerous . " " Is it more dangerous coming home than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why wo n't he do it ? " " He just did it to prove that he could . " " What will he do now ? " " I do n't know . " " Your baby has funny eyes . " " I 've noticed . " " What crossed them ? " " No one knows that for sure . " " Your wife said  --  " " Young lady , you talk too much . "  |p188Wanda  went to sleep . Nothing more was said by anyone until we reached home . " I 'll carry her in , " Tom told me . He did . Upstairs to the room that opened out of Jake 's and mine . Without so much as a good night , he went down to the parlor bedroom , which he occupied when he stayed overnight . I undressed Wanda , then went to bed myself . It was scarcely dark . Everyone except chickens and the sick was up and about , getting supper in Amesville ; Lindy was rejoicing in Paris ; Jake was talking shoes in Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much by walls as by three words . They were not true , these words . Why would I let someone who had no idea what I felt define for me an act of mine ? Did n't I know better than she ? If you were born hating the act of chewing and the flow of saliva carrying food downward , it would be admirable to say no to eating . Never pull up your chair , unfold a napkin , separate flesh from bone just to please someone whose pleasure it was to serve it forth . Nora could say no . Her face showed the absence of conflict . Did n't she ever worry about Tom , who loved to serve it forth ? If she had , now she had solved that problem , too . I was the solution . I was everyone 's solution . Oh , doormat of the Zodiac ! That was n't true . Jake was a solution for me ; and Tom also . I just had n't the luck of finding all my solutions in one person . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with so much muscle and backbone he was n't afraid to cry . No one was going to call him a sissy , not more than once , anyway . It took two things to enable a man to cry  --  a tender heart and a strong arm . Bruisers with stony hearts never cried . The same was true of weaklings who could n't swat a fly . Tom loved God enough to take His name in vain . What other word belonged in the mouth on great occasions ? It should n't be a debate . " By this act I refute you , Nora O'Hara . " It would be a refutation just the same if I went to Tom . I stopped in Wanda 's room before I went downstairs . She wassleeping as always , not curled up as if to protect herself , or still inp189the womb . Flat on her back , straight as a ramrod , silent as a log . Forgive me , Wanda , I thought . Tom had n't gone to bed . He was sitting , fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching , or at least looking out toward , where the new moon was setting . He did n't hear me come in . When I put my arm around his neck , he said , " I thought you were mad at me . " " The kettle is calling the pot black . " " I was mad at you . Fly across the ocean all alone and it do n't mean as much as your darned cat climbing a fence . " " I love my darned cat . " " You ought to love Lindy . " " I love Lindy . Come on to bed , Tom . " I untied his tie , unbuttoned his shirt , pushed down his suspenders . " You going to undress me ? " " If I have to . " " You do n't have to , kid . " Tom was a big man , thick as well as wide and long . I lay by his side as if in the shade of a sheltering cliff . " It was n't Lindy , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you 'd feel better to know . ' Your poor wife and children . ' Those were your words . I thought you 'd feel better if you really knew how it was . " " I do feel better about them . It 's me I do n't feel so good about . " " A vulgar dirty little act ? " " Nasty ! " " It is if you feel that way . Eskimos think kissing is nasty . Get your mouth all mixed up with somebody else 's spit and teeth . " " Did you make that up ? " " No , it 's true . That 's the way they feel about it . " " Murder is wrong , no matter how you feel about it , is n't it ? " " Sure . Worse if you like it . " " God would n't have made a nasty little act the only way to have children , would He ? " " No God I know anything about . " " He made some rules , though ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " And we 're breaking them . " " Not recently . " Tom made me laugh . I kissed him . " Teeth and spit , " he said . " The Eskimos do n't know what they 're missing . " " I love you , Tom . " " I wondered if you 'd ever say that . " " You never asked me if I did . " " What you have to ask for 's no good . " " Beggars do n't think so . " " Kid , I 'm no beggar . " " Thieves do n't even ask . " " If it ai n't a gift , I do n't want it . " " It 's a gift . " We woke just at sunup . Tom had to be in Louisville early . I had to look after Wanda . " Nora is wrong , " I told Tom . " Worse than an Eskimo . " " Poor girl , " said Tom . I dressed before I went into Wanda 's room . " Put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He wo n't be here until night . " " He might surprise us someday . " But , out of habit , I put on the switch . We had the first strawberries of the season for breakfast . " If Lindy was here , it would be perfect , " Wanda said . " Not for me or Lindy , " said Tom . " How about you , Orpha ? " " I 'm happy just as we are . " After Tom left , I took my switch off again . I was floating , floating , and it seemed to weigh me down . Wanda , who noticed everything , noticed . " If I hear Papa turn in the drive , I 'll let you know . " I was teaching the child deception . There were a thousand things I wanted to do that day . Among them was to put some words into my Book of Unspoken Thoughts . If Tom had been there , they would have been spoken . In a way , Ip191was still talking to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonderings the night before . Unless you are crazy , nasty acts make you feel nasty afterward . Only lunatics enjoy killing flies or slapping babies or eating so much they puke . Unless you are crazy , an act that makes you love the whole world can not be nasty . Where there is no feeling at all , the act is not nasty . The unrespondingbody takes no message to the brain . " Nasty " is the brain 's word . The bumblebee is also small and quick , but one knows that it has been there . To receive and give simultaneously : if a flower could love us when we inhale its scent ; if a sunset could respond to its admirers with a deeper crimson . Wanda and I painted a beautiful picture of a farmhouse that day . Dusted the rungs of chairs . Beat braided rugs gently . Bade every picture hang even . Scoured the stains out of teacups . And the samecoloredstains out of chamber pots . Bon Ami-ed the front windows . Made strawberry shortcake for supper . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eat a boiled pea unaccompanied by any sauce ) , fried chicken , made gravy . If Jake thought the splendor was all for him , that was not intentionaldeceit on my part . The house-shine and food-savor were the result of a happiness that did n't permit standing still . There was nothing wrong in letting Jake share that bounty , was there ? At six , without being warned by Wanda , I had my hair back on , the table set , biscuits and shortcake in the oven . Jake did n't come at six , or seven or eight . In the first months , this had worried me . Had the car gone over a cliff ? A runaway horse crashed into him ? A bridge collapsed ? Jake was always late , maybe an hour or two , maybe , as now , until next day . I did n't worry any more . I did fume . Why could n't he let me know ? We had a phone . He knew that I worried . I had walked with a lantern one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south fork of the Rattatack , where , I was afraid , the bridge might have gone out . It had n't , and Jake overtook me homeward-bound and soaking wet . Jake had two kinds of pride  --  one as a businessman , the other as a householder . The businessman 's pride was never to be late ; the householder 's was never to be on time.  |p192Neither  Ebon nor Nettie had phones . Papa and Mama did not want to make the long drive at that hour of the evening . So Wanda and I ate the good food alone . Pussy ate a whole chicken wing on a sheet of the Louisville Courier . After supper I reread some of Joe 's letters . I sat in a rocking chair ( home of the hurt ) . Wanda was on my lap , and on her lap was Pussy . Pussy purred , I rocked , Wanda stroked . I read Joe 's letters aloud . They were all about Jesus . Was Jesus a storybook man to Wanda , a magician , a Santa Claus before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors the way you asked Santa for presents . Only Jesus , of course , made promises . " Ask and ye shall receive . " Santa said , " Be good . " Were my Unspoken Thoughts really talk with Jesus ? In any case , He knew them . Could I have put them down if I had believed that no eye would see ? No ear hear ? Maybe . In the beehive of the brain , thoughts that never escape buzz around the cranium night and day . With pen and paper I cracked the cranium , freed the thoughts , and stopped the buzzing . " Did I ever see Uncle Joe , Mama ? " " No , you never did . " " Does he look like you ? " " No . He 's handsome . " " What 's a seminary ? " " A school where men go to learn to be preachers . " " Can women go ? " " No . " " Why not ? Do n't God love women ? " " God did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lodge ? Like the Odd Fellows ? " " Kind of . " " Can Uncle Joe really see Jesus ? " " Yes . " " Can you ? " " No . " " You pray . He could n't hear you if He was n't there , could He ? " " No . He 's there , all right . But only the pure in heart can see Him . " " If I prayed hard , could I see Him ? " " If you had enough faith . " " I do n't , " said Wanda . " I will never see Jesus . But I love Him and He loves me. "  |p193I  rocked . Pussy purred . Wanda stroked . Joe wrote , " I think my sickness was only the effort of my flesh to tell me something about my soul . My soul could rot and bleed and I would never have noticed it . Never even notice that I had a soul . God woke me up by making my body sick . I looked inward then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and preach the gospel of the Son of God . Which I am also . " The purring had stopped . The stroking had stopped . Two slept . I thought : Wanda , child of adultery ; Orpha , adulteress . One owes her life to the forbidden act ; one owes her happiness to it . The last , not absolutely true . I was happy when telephone wires sang in the wind , when roosters crowed , when summer 's giant clouds cast their traveling shadows over sunny fields . Clouds and roosters and telephonewires ( plus a little wind ) : was a life that asked no more than that for happiness damaged ? And was happiness the answer ? Did Jesus ever tell anyone to be happy ? Or Moses ? Or Paul ? Was Jesus ever happy ? Hanging on the cross , true to His Father 's commandment , was He perhaps the happiest He had ever been ? I needed to talk to Joe . I intended to tell Jake next day of my visit with Nora . He objected to Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it done . Wanda started school . Tom was transferred to Louisville as managerof the new store there . Nora and the children stayed in Cincinnati . I saw Tom as much as ever . Jake never noticed ; or if he noticed , he did n't care . I resented this . I thought a husband should notice . I did n't ask Jake for what I would call " love " ; I did think he owed me some jealousy . Some suspicion . Was n't he even enough aware of me to wonder about my high spirits after he 'd been gone ? When Nora asked me to visit her again , there was no reason not to go . Wanda in school , Jake in Piqua , Tom eager for a pleasant daytime ride through maple and hickory and sycamore at the height of this Indian summer war paint . " What 's she want to see me about this time ? " " Search me , " Tom said . " Nora and me do n't confide in each other . It 'll be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run , I guess what she told me last time maybe did help . "  | " Maybe she wants you to see Pete 's eyes . " " Did the operation cure them ? " " I would n't say cure . They 're still a little off plumb . But it do n't give you a downright headache any more to look at the poor kid . I 'll pick you up in time to get you home by suppertime . " Tom never liked being with me when his kids were around . He felt the same guilt with them I felt with Wanda . He let me off at the gate and was gone before Nora came to the door , though she did wave at his disappearing car . Nora was still just as sweet as her face . Tom was right . Her intentionwas to do me good . She had Pete in her arms , though now , at three , he was a lunk of a boy to be carrying around . The habit of coddling , developed early because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer required it . " I am going to take you to visit someone you ought to know , " Nora said . " Someone who would make you feel better about Jake . " " I feel all right about Jake , " I said . Which was a lie . " Last time you were here , you did n't . " " I still do n't , " I confessed . " I thought so . I feel better about Tom now that Pete 's eyes are better . " " What did Tom have to do with Pete 's eyes ? " " I told you . Except for him , there would n't have been any need of vinegar and water . That 's plain , surely . " In a way , Nora 's way , it was plain . We had gone over all that on my last visit . I changed the subject . " Who are we going to see ? " " It 's a surprise . We 'll go by streetcar , with a little walk at both ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what made her think I could n't . " I can run , " I said . " Well , no need of that . " " Are we a surprise to the person we 're visiting ? " " No . Rosa expects you . " " Rosa ! That was the name of Jake 's first wife . " " This is Jake 's first wife . " " When did she get back ? " " Get back from where ? " " Germany . Where she went when she got homesick and ran away from Jake . "  | " She ran away , all right , but she was never homesick for Ger-many . " " But Jake told me  --  " " You you can hear Rosa 's story from Rosa . I reckon it wo n't be like Jake 's any more than your story of marriage would be like his . I wo n't stay . You and Rosa need to talk private . " " I think I 'll ride back with you . " " You can if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nora , you and I are as different as night and day . " " Not that different . Tom liked me and he likes you . " " A man can like night and day , both . " " I ca n't make you go . It 's up to you . " I went . We walked three blocks from the end of the trolley line to a larger house and a prettier garden than Nora 's . Or mine . Rosa was now Mrs. Shaughnessey ; Nora had told me that . Rosa was standing on the front porch waiting for me . I turned to Nora , expecting her to lead the way , and saw she was heading back to the trolley . When I reached the top of the steps , Rosa and I , without saying a word , sat down , I on a chair , she on the porch swing , and looked at each other . I saw myself , ten years older . Rosa looked at herself , ten years younger . We were not twins , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow-colored . Rosa , I judged , by the set of her mouth before she had said a word , was outspoken and strong-minded ; she did n't keep any book of Unspoken Thoughts . They were all spoken . Jake had told me she was beautiful . She never could have been , not even sixteen years ago . Never ugly , with regular features , high color , and sandstone eyes ; but a chin as strong as Dempsey 's . Jake was praising himself when he called Rosa beautiful ; a man who attracted handsome women . He said it to impress me , and I was impressed . Rosa , rocking herself in the shooting swing , said , " My God ! So once was n't enough ! " That was fine for Rosa . A man so attracted by her that when she an away from him the only way he could solace himself was by finding someone as like her as possible . But where did that leave me ? Not a real person . Not Orpha Chase Dudley . Just a look-alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did n't speak out , but wrote in a book . Who gave hint a ready-made child.  |p196Rosa  said " My God " again . Then , " Well , you can see what anotherten years ' ! ! do for you . If that 's any comfort . What else did the old bastard tell you ? " Rosa was a rough talker . Was it Germany ? Or did being married to Jake , who was what Mama called " nasty-nice , " bring out in her the defiance of roughness ? " He told me you got homesick for your folks in Germany . And went home to them . " " I did n't have any folks in Germany . " " He said you wanted to leave your uncle here in Cincinnati . " " And you believe everything he told you ? Swallowed it hook , line , and sinker ? I can see you did . You were born to be bamboozled . Well , the uncle part is true . At nineteen , I thought it would be better to be knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably right . Though Jake did n't give me the answer . Oh , he tried , all right . Knock , knock , knock , day and night . How do you put up with all that ? Well , it 's none of my business . No children , though , I 'll wager . I 've got three . They 're all at school now . Shaughnessey is a fine man . I 'm not his chamber pot , handy when he needs empty-ing . " " Do you hate Jake so much ? " " Not at all . No more than warts . Something that happens to you when you 're a know-nothing kid . How long have you been married ? " " To Jake ? Four years . " " How come you 're just now finding out I 'm not in Germany ? " " I do n't come to Cincinnati . " " You 're near . Why not ? " " Jake asked Ere not to . " " In God 's name , girl , you 're not six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Maybe I was born without any . " " You 're still young . Grow some . " " I 'm sly , not spunky . I do the little things Jake asks me to do . That way , he does n't notice the big things . " " So that 's the way it is . " I did n't have enough spunk to come right out and say yes , that 's the way . I did n't need to . " That 's a rotten way to live . I do n't know which one of you I feel sorriest for . " I knew which.  | " Why did Nora bring you over here ? " " She thought seeing you would keep me from feeling so guilty about Jake . " " Guilty about Jake ! How did she know you feel guilty about Jake ? " That was another question I did n't answer  --  and did n't need to . " So that 's the way it is , " she said again . " Well , feel less guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does she think about you and Tom ? " " She thinks we 're sinners . " " Then why 's she want you to feel good ? " " I 'm not sure . Maybe she thinks if I do n't , Tom may sin worse with someone else . " " How could he ? You 're a married woman . " " Someone who 'd have to do away with a child . " " Oh , Jesus ! Come in and have a cup of coffee . Or a glass of beer . You need something . Do n't you have anyone you can talk to ? " " Tom . Wanda . " " Who 's Wanda ? " " My adopted daughter . She 's only six . " " She 's not going to be much help . Do n't you have a mother ? " " I 'd be ashamed to tell her . " " Stop doing what you 're ashamed of . I did . " " You had Mr. Shaughnessey . " " Not till I left Jake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the table in the front hall . Rosa took my arm and held me by her side in front of it . " Take a look . You 're going to look a lot worse than me in ten years ' time . Nothing ruins a face so fast as double-dealing . Your face telling one story to the world . Your heart yanking your face to pieces , trying to let the truth be known . One eyelid 'll hang down lower than the other , one side of your mouth 'll stay stiff while the other smiles . I know a dozen cases like that . " " You think I should give up Tom ? " " Both of them . Jake first , then Tom . " Rosa had good black coffee , and pound cake so rich with butter and eggs it could be the mainstay of your diet . Jake had told the truth about one thing  --  Rosa was a good cook . She was determined to talk to me about Jake , to let me know how awful he had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't , she needed to justify her decision to me . Was it an indication of the part words were to play in my life that Rosa 's rough words seemed worse to me than my acts ? Rosa said all the words , unmistakable words . I had never before heard sex talked about ; and certainly I had never talked about it myself . I did n't now . But I listened . Because Rosa and I looked so much alike , with the exception of the ten years ' difference in age , I felt that I might be listening to an older , more experienced self warning a younger one . Ordinarily one learns from the past . Was the future speaking to me now ? Because of the prolonged talk , I did n't get back to Nora 's at the time Tom expected to pick me up . He saved me the trouble of that trolley ride by coming to Rosa 's . On the front porch waiting for him , Rosa had two last things to tell me . The first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that . " " I know that , " I agreed . " Orpha , I did n't tell you the very worst thing about Jake . Never once in the four years I was married to him did he make me laugh . That is unforgivable . " For the first ten or fifteen minutes , I just leaned against Tom . Neither of us said anything . Then Tom said , " Maybe Jake was right telling you to stay away from Cincinnati . " " He certainly had his reasons . Did you know that Rosa looked like me ? " " Fifteen or twenty years ago , maybe . " " How do you think being her twin makes me feel ? " " She 's a pretty good-looking woman . " " Makes me feel like a shadow . I 'm nobody . I 'm Rosa 's shadow . " " Not to me , you ai n't . " " I am to Jake . " " I did n't know you cared that much about Jake . " " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow . How would you like to be married to a shadow ? " " You 're the only wife I 've got . You 're no shadow . " " Do n't joke about serious things . " " Joke ? If you think that 's a joke , you 've got a peculiar sense of humor . " " Do you know what Rosa says is the very worst thing about Jake ? "  | " I can guess . " " No , you ca n't . The worst thing is that he never made her laugh . " " If that 's what she wanted , she sure picked the wrong guy . " " You 've been in Jake 's house in Cincinnati , have n't you ? " " Sure . " " In his mother 's room ? " " I did n't know there was such a room . " " There is . And what 's in it are all the things a mother keeps of her little boy . A box with his curls . The first picture Jacob ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cat ! That 's before he found out that more than cats are called Pussy . ' His first mush bowl and spoon are there . " " I though you said this was his mother 's room . " " It is . Or was . It 's filled with the things of his she 'd kept . And he 's kept them all just as she left them . Rosa knows . She lived in that house all the time she was married . He loved that room . He 'd go in there , Rosa says , and be Mama 's little boy again . " " What did Mama think of her little boy getting married ? " " While she lived , he did n't . He never would 've , Rosa says , if Mama had n't died . " " Poor Rosa . " " Poor me . Did you know his mother wore her hair in a bun on the back of her head , the way I do ? " " The way you do sometimes . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wife ? " " Orpha , you 're my sweetheart . " I sat tall enough in the seat to put my arm across Tom 's shoulders . " I 'm a stepmother to Wanda and a stepwife to you . " " You 're all the mother Wanda has , and all the wife I have . " " Nora should 've married Jake and you should 've married Rosa . " " Where does that leave you ? " " With Shaughnessey , I guess . " Wanda was waiting at the end of the lane that led to our house . Tom stopped for her . She had my switch in a paper bag . " Pitt it on , Manna . Papa 's at home . "  |p200I  could clamp that hair on and coil it at the stub at the nape of my neck in my sleep . I knew that Wanda had long since learned that I hid some things from Jake . I was n't happy that Tom should know that Wanda was involved in my deceit . " I told Papa that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you tell him where ? " " He does n't care . He thinks it 's nice for Uncle Tom to take you for a ride . " He did think it was nice . He tried to persuade Tom to stay for supper . " Ca n't think of it , Jake . Nora 's expecting me . I 'll be late as it is . Thanks just the same . " After Tom left , Jake said , " Nora 's got a real fine husband . A lot of men with a wife like that , her mind on just two things , church and the children , would develop a wandering eye . " The impulse to set Jake right was almost overwhelming . I wanted to yell , " Wake up , Jake , you idiot . Tom 's got a wandering eye . And who it 's wandering to is me . Just because there are some words you wo n't say and some acts you 're ashamed of , do n't mean those words and acts do n't exist . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes on people 's naked feet and hair on my bobbed head . If I loved you the way I ought , I 'd yank off my false hair . I 'd show you where I 've hidden Socialism . I 'd call Pussy , Pussy , Pussy ' to my dear cat till you were willing to give a woman 's center its right name withoutblushing . Oh , Jake , I pity you from the bottom of my heart . " It was the pity that kept me from saying a word . I cooked supper . Leaves , frost struck , drifted down . A basket of Maclntosh apples scented the kitchen . Wanda showed us animal shapes with shadows made by her fingers . After supper , while Jake read the Courier in the sitting room , I sat at the kitchen table and wrote in my Book of Unspoken Thoughts . What if a doctor pitied you so much that in order to spare you pain , he would n't operate ? Can you love the one you pity ? " Like as a Father pitieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man want to be treated as a child by a woman ? Or does he in that way become once again Mama 's little boy , his precious curls still in her keepsake box ? Somebody ( Lon ? ) said , " Pity is next door to contempt . "  |p201Is  pity the choice of those without the courage to be honest ? I would n't mind being pitied . I think I am pitiable . It would perhapsdepend upon who pitied me . R. probably pities me . Does W. ? I think so . T. does n't . When I heard Jake fold his paper , I slipped my Book of UnspokenThoughts into its hiding place in the groove between the table top and the support for its leaves . Jake did n't know about Unspoken Thoughts . Except for letter-writing , he did n't like to see me writing anything . Writing was a way of hiding what you really thought , he believed . He was right . Jake usually went to bed after finishing the Courier . Sometimes he came to the kitchen to mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach-sweetener . He came out this evening just to talk . " I 've got an idea for something I should have had long ago : shoe-repair shops in connection with every shoe store . I got it into my head that selling shoes was a step upward from repairing shoes . That 's nonsense . Garagemen likely make more money than car salesmen . I got it into my head that by repairing shoes , I was cutting my own throat as a shoe seller . The man who had his old shoes mended would n't buy a new pair . Poppycock ! Some 'll do one thing , some another , and the way to cash in on both is to cater to both . Look at this . " Jake took off one shoe . Jake was the cleanest man in the world . He could 've stirred the soup with his toes without harming the soup . " Now , I do n't suppose you can tell me what kind of a shoe this is ? " " It 's an oxford , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boot , oxford , moccasin . That 's about the sum total of your shoe knowledge . It 's a McKay shoe . Now , before you can start repairing a shoe , you 've got to know what kind of a shoe you 're working on . There are two chief kinds , Welt and McKay . I prefer the Welt , but I 've been wearing a McKay just to try it out . Better than either is a Turn shoe . " " Is a Turn shoe anything like a turncoat ? " I asked . " I thought maybe you 'd like to know a little something about your husband 's business . After all , it 's what puts the bread and butter in our mouths . "  | " I was just joking . " " Kings , I believe , had court jesters . They do n't fit into ordinary households very comfortably . " " I 'm sorry . It was just a play on words . " " The shoe business is more than play and more than words . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the human foot . There 's nothing funny about it . " " I 'm sorry . What is a Turn shoe ? " " It 's a shoe that is made wrong side out , then turned . " I kept enough of my mind on shoes to follow Jake 's descriptions . But most of it was still hearing what Rosa had had to say about him . Except for the information about Jake 's mother , nothing Rosa had said was news to me . It was all an old story , but a story I had never put in words . Hearing the words was the difference between blood in your veins and blood on the floor . Realizing that Jake had finished his talk about repair shops , I told him that I thought it a fine idea . He said , " Bedtime , Orpha . " He stood behind my chair and cupped my breasts in his hands . This act , less intimate than the other , was longer and more felt . I remained still . I made myself immovable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved that more than once in a lifetime . I always washed and put cucumber cream on my face and hands before going to bed . Since I had n't done so that night , I got up as soon as Jake 's breathing told me he was asleep . After washing and anointing , I went to Wanda 's room . " Mama , " she said , " are you sick ? " " No , no . I just went to the bathroom . " " You smell sweet . " " That 's my cucumber cream . " " What 's cucumber cream for ? " " It bleaches freckles and softens . " " Get in bed with me , Mama . You used to all the time . " " That was before I had a husband to sleep with . "  | " You could come in for a little while . He would never know . Could n't you ? " There was no answer for this . Wanda knew that I hid some things from Jake . This was n't a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long and miserable day . My eyes ached for sleep . Wanda , who knew things like this without being told , said , " If you fall asleep , Mama , I 'll wake you up . " It would be freezing by morning . I had washed in cold water . When Wanda turned back her covers , warmth flowed up from her bed . " Ten minutes only , " I told her . Under Wanda 's covers , when I stretched full length , I touched something that startled me . " What 's in your bed ? " " It 's only Mouser , Mama . " " Mouser ? " " I call her that to please Papa . " " It would n't please him if he knew you had a cat in bed with you . " I bring her in after he 's in bed . And I put her out before he gets up . You do n't mind , do you , Mama ? " " I mind not being told . " " If you knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , Mama . " I put it on the floor beside the bed . Wanda ran her hand through my hair . " You 're cold , Mama . " I was , but the combination of the cat and the child radiated warmth . Wanda was short-coupled , as they say of horses , warm as a chunky little base burner . " You were shaking , Mama . " I had n't known it till I was told . Without being told , I knew the luxury of lying warm and still . " Is Pussy in your way , Mama ? She can sleep outside the covers . " " No , no , she 's fine . She 's a foot warmer . " " Are you cold ? " " Is the cat in your way ? " Somebody patting my head . Somebody worried about my comfort . I began to cry . It is strange : misery can be endured dry-eyed , but a little tenderness brings on a flood of tears.  |p204Wanda  was motherly . " Mama , let 's say our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Let 's say our prayers and go to sleep . " " You say yours first , Wanda . " Wanda 's bedtime prayer had always been " Gentle Jesus , meek and mild . " She said the whole of it . I always prayed for everyone in the family , most of all for Joey , far from home . My prayer ended as always , " Lead us and keep us , for Thy Name 's sake . " Wanda said , " You did n't pray for Papa . " " You do it , Wanda . " Wanda did . Then she said , " Good night , Mama , " and I slept untilWanda awakened me . " It 's daylight , Mama . Time to get up . " Wanda was already outside the bed . " I put Pussy in the woodshed . Hurry or you 'll freeze . " I was at the door when Wanda ran to me . " Your hair , Mama , your hair . " Jake was still asleep , on his back gently snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knee on the bed , I had a change of heart . If a bun on the back of my head pleased Jake , why not wear it ? When Jake awakened , there I was , as if never absent , disguise in place . " Turn over , wifey , " he said . I never again saw Nora or Rosa . They asked to see me and I could have gone . Jake was so busy getting his new repair shops started , he was hardly aware of what I did . He could n't have chosen a better line of business or a better time to start it . By the early thirties , the Depression was already well under way . Sixty percent of the people in America were making two thousand dollars or less a year . " Brother , can you spare a dime ? " had become a kind of national anthem . People who in better times would have bought a new pair of shoes now had the old pair halfsoled . If they bought a new pair of shoelaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoe business that brought in cash , had a farm that made it unnecessary to pay out much for householdp205supplies . True , we did n't grow tea or sugar cane ; but there was plenty of corn , buckwheat , potatoes , apples , pieplant , berries , milk , cream , and eggs . After talking to Nora and Rosa , I made a greater effort than ever before to be kind to Jake . The boy who had to endure curls ; consideringtheir length , he must have worn them until he was six or seven . The man who had heard those brutal words from Rosa ; who had to lie to hide the real reason she left him . Did n't he deserve some kindness now ? Was what I gave him really kindness ? He thought so . That is why , I suppose , the final revelation hurt him so . The elaborate parties for my bridge club pleased him . I could now make puffles as well as any woman in Amesville . Church supperswere better attended at our place than at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class meetings , though Jake never joined us , seemed to give him pleasure . In addition to Ebon and Nettie , Wanda now attended these weekly study sessions . A child of eight obviously could n't understand socialism . We did n't understand it very well ourselves . Socialism in that time of want and business failure was a more important subject than it had been when Joe first sent me Spargo 's book . Would what was happening have been possible in a socialist state ? The nearer Joe got to the ministry , the more of a socialist he became . He sent us additional pamphlets and circulars . In California , there was talk of giving everyone over sixty years old sixty dollars a month . The recipient would then be required to stop work and an unemployed young man would take the older man 's job and receive his former salary . Ebon , already half a socialist , could n't swallow this . " Giving money away for nothing , " he said . " It will bankrupt the country . " We read Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's days with Shakespeare and the Bible . ) Even Wanda enjoyed Main Street , and wished she had been named Carol instead of Wanda . Today , a child like Wanda would bring home from school a little booklet entitled How to Live with Your Gifted Child . In the thirties that terminologyhad not yet been invented . I.Q. 's were being determined in some parts of the country ; not in the little town of Amesville . Wanda 's classification with us was " quick , " " bright , " and sometimes " too smart for her own good . " She remained Kickapoo in looks : dark ,  |p206chunky  , broad-faced . She did n't , insofar as anyone knew , have a drop of Indian blood in her veins , but in addition to her looks she had characteristics that were thought of as typical of Indians : she was calm , did not complain about small hurts ; undertook and completed tasks most children would have whined about or run away from . She spoke up at our study sessions like a chief at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I saw Tom more often than ever . Jake was like a man over whose wounds scar tissue , tougher and more protective than natural skin , had formed . I slept with Jake every night . I spoke no wounding words of the kind Rosa had used . He did not notice  --  or if he noticed , thought nothing of  --  my jaunts with Tom . Today , an analyst might speculate that if I really was , with my bun and my sensible schoolmarm lingo , Jake 's mother to him , and with whom for decency 's sake he was quickly incestuous , he was also too loyal to believe that his mother could care for any other boy as much as she did for her own dear little Jacob . On my thirtieth birthday , Tom and I went to Clifty Falls , the Niagara of our part of the woods . What hidden sexual symbolism lies in a rush of falling water , I do n't know . At the falls , Tom said , " I am going for once in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing makeshift . Our bed . A bed I 've bought and paid for . I 'm going to go to sleep with you and and I 'm going to wake up with you . " " Jake may or may not be home tonight . You know that . " " It does n't make any difference . Jake is gun-shy . No woman again is going to hurt him . I 'll call Wanda and tell her the car 's broken down , that we 'll be home as soon as it 's fixed . " " I do n't like to lie to Wanda . " " Oh , Orpha , Wanda 's whole life 's been built on a lie . You going to start telling her you ai n't her mother ? " " I do n't like leaving her alone . " " Well , you 've got to make your choice . Tonight , it 's me or Wanda . " That night , it was Tom . Tom was right . Jake did come home and received the message Tom gave Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interestp207was in the mishap to the car , not in where we had spent the night . After Tom left , he said to Wanda , " You go out and play for a while , Sis . I want to talk to your mother . " As soon as Wanda was out of earshot , he said , " Sit down . Sit down . I have something to say to you . " We were in the kitchen . I sat . This was something I had long expected . The pain I felt was for Jake . The skin over his face was very tight . The openings for his eyes and mouth were so narrow , I wondered that he could see or speak . I almost blurted out , " I will never see Tom again . " I meant it . I was thirty years old , no longer a girl . Jake had protected me as a teacher , treated Wanda like a daughter , and given me a home . Tom would find another woman , and I would settle down to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a woman guided by her good sense , not her feelings . Before I said a word , Jake held out for my inspection two notebooks , two of my books of Unspoken Thoughts . " So these are your unspoken thoughts , Orpha ? You wrote in these books thoughts no good wife should ever have . " " Everybody has bad thoughts sometimes . I put these in writing and got them out of my mind . It was like burying them . " " Writing down your thoughts is not like burying them , Orpha . It is like preserving them . You know that as well as I do . You got them out of your head by putting them on paper . But by doing that , you put them where anyone who can read can get them in his head . They 're in my head now . They cut me to the quick , Orpha . My little schoolmarm I worked to help . I thought I might read in your notebooks some appreciation of our early days . I was lonesome last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I promise you  --  " " Do n't be upset about last night . Breakdowns will happen to the best of cars . Just be thankful you were with a friend of mine . All I ask of you now is that you do for me what you did for yourself . You buried those thoughts from yourself by writing them down . Bury them for me by burning these books . I 've kept the fire going for just that purpose . When I see those pages burning , your words will go out of my mind , too . " Jake handed the books to me . He took the lid off the kitchen stove . There was a thick bed of coals with an occasional small burst of live flame.  |p208I  could not put my books in there . They were me . It was like asking me to throw my living brain into the fire , my beating heart , my hand that wrote the words . It was like asking me to die . " You do it if you want to , Jake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn them . " I held the books toward him . " No , no . That 's not the same at all . They 're your thoughts . I ca n't destroy them . You must do it . When you do , I 'll know you have taken them from your mind . I 'll forget them then , too . " How was I able to resist him ? Knowing what he 'd already been through , knowing what was in those books ? I do n't know how ; but I could not burn those books any more than I could put my hand in the fire . Less easily . What I had thought was more a part of me than my flesh . They were me . Flesh was only what covered me . Jake stood . I sat . The books remained in my lap . I was paralyzed . I could neither move nor speak . I watched the coals die out . I watched the life go out of Jake 's taut face . Jake said , " I am going upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Cincinnati . When you let me know that you have burned those books , I 'll be back . But not until then . " I never burned those books and Jake never came back . Joey , when I wrote him that Jake had left me , replied , " Come to California . I need a housekeeper . I 've joined the Society of Friends and with God 's help will soon be recorded as a minister of that Society . I 'm sorry about you and Jake . That 's his loss . I hope it 's my gain . I need a housekeeper . " After Jake left , I no longer saw Tom as often as I had . Tom did n't understand my reason for doing so  --  and I did n't understand them very well myself . I had n't written my Unspoken Thoughts in order to drive Jake away . If I began seeing Tom regularly , it would seem so . To whom ? To me . So what ? The " what " was that my Unspoken Thoughts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror of paper . Impure , something devised as a club to drive Jake away . Did I stop seeing Tom because I could no longer hurt Jake by doing so ? I talked to Tom about it in the few times I saw him before I left for California.  | " It beats me , " Tom said , " why , when you had to sneak off like a chicken thief to be with me , you were willing to do so . Now , with Jake gone , no sneaking necessary , you treat me like a man selling Watkins products . Polite , but not having any . " " I do n't understand it , either , Tom . With Jake here keeping his eye on us , it seemed fair . With Jake gone , I feel like I 'm taking advantage of him . " " My God . What kind of reasoning is that ? Sounds like what you loved was n't me , but risk . Adventure . Putting something over on somebody . " " Could it be I loved both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true . How did Jake get hold of those books , anyway ? " " I hid them under the kitchen table in the place where the leaves go . " I can think of about a thousand places more secure than that . " " Jake never pulled that table open before in his life . " " What was he doing it for when you were gone ? " " He was going to polish the whole thing , leaves and all , for a church supper . " " Could I see them ? " " If you want to . There 's nothing in them to hurt you . " Tom read without saying anything , except " They do n't sound like you . " " They sound like me writing . " " Hi , " he said . " I hope this is me . His physical presence  --  not saying a word , silent as a star , more silent than the wind  --  gives me pleasure . ' That 's not Jake , is it ? " " That 's you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What the hell does that mean ? " " I do n't know . " " For years as a faithful wife , she had compared him to his greatdisadvantage with men of her imagination . This he had not resented . Then , when unfaithful , she compared him with real men to hisadvantage , he was sick with resentment . ' This me , Orpha ? " " You know it is n't . " " Someone else ? " " No one . That 's just writing  --  when I did n't really have anything to say , but wanted to write . "  | " Orpha , you are crazy . I do n't know how Jake stood it as long as he did . " " How about you ? " " Yeh , that 's true . How about me . Is this me ? It was the dream behind his face I loved . ' " " No . Lon . " Tom threw boths books down . " Why would n't he burn them ? I sure as hell would 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean I was sorry . " " Are you ? " " I 'm sorry Jake saw them . If I was sorry I wrote them , I 'd have to wish I was someone else . " I went over to Tom and put my arms around his neck . " Remember , I 'm the Watkins man . " " Tom , you and Joey and Papa and Lon , when he was alive , are the only men I love . " " Why did you marry Jake ? " " I was trying to be sensible . " " I 'd give that up in the future if I was you , Orpha . It ai n't your style . " Being sensible was still my ambition , though . What was the sensiblething to do about going to California ? Papa and Mama said , " Go . " What would I use for money ? To get there and after I 'd arrived ? Farms could n't be sold  --  or even given away . Ebon could sell enough and barter enough off Lon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . But raise enough money for a trip west ? It could n't be done . Papa and Mama , who wanted me to be with Joe , both for his and my own sake , were as hard hit in their nursery business as everyone else . Getting another teaching job might not be possible . The cry during the Depression was for women to stay home and let the men have the paying jobs . Then Tom came with a letter from Jake . When Tom handed it to me , I said , " Why did n't Jake mail it ? " " He wanted me to talk to you about what he has to say . " " You know what 's in it ? "  | " Jake told me . " " Do n't you feel uncomfortable talking to Jake about me ? With him so ignorant ? " " I 'd feel a damned sight more uncomfortable if he was n't . Read your letter . " When I read it , I said , " What does this mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he does ? " " No . Jake wants to love himself more than he does . You wrote that rotten stuff about him  --  " " I did n't mention Jake . " " Well , it was n't exactly a recommendation . Now , if he offers the woman that wrote that stuff five hundred dollars and a farm , he 's turning the other cheek . He 's saying , ' The woman was a bitch , but I forgive her . ' " " Jake does n't use words like that . " " He 's probably got some unspoken thoughts , too . Using whateverwords he would use and telling himself , I 'm not taking , it out on her . She was mean-spirited and I 'm big-hearted . ' And he pats himself on the back . " " You talk like you know Jake pretty well . " " I do . I know Shaughnessey , and Shaughnessey married Jake 's first wife . This is nothing new with Jake . He puts out money and buys himself forgiveness in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take it ? " " Sure , I 'd take it . Do Jake good and do you no harm . " " What can I do with another farm ? " " Right now , not much . Let Ebon get out of it what he can . " " What 'll I do with the five hundred ? " " You already decided that . " " You do n't care ? " " Sure , I care . But if you 're not going to see me anyway , I 'd rather you 'd be in California than Amesville . " " If you were me , would you go ? " " I sure would . One husband a suicide . One husband run off . Californiaor Australia , I 'd put some distance between me and Amesville . You 're bad news around here . I 've got to wondering if I 'm to be the next casualty myself . " " You do n't really wonder that ! "  | " If I was smart , I would . " " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never would , Orpha . " Everyone wanted me to leave . Parents , brother , husband , lover , tenant farmer , and especially Wanda . California was the Land of Oz to her , the Emerald City . Papa Jake vanished from her life as if he had never been . Uncle Joey , the preacher-to-be , the handsome traveler , the French-harp player , waited . Oranges and lemons , roses in winter , waited . And the biggest ocean of all , crashing around the edges of that western land , waited . Still I dawdled . Nothing to keep me , Joe waiting , parents urging , I lingered . I was not willing to try anything new . I lived in the big house like the occupant of a shell that has by some chance had all the irritating sand swept away . Wanda came home from school with Five Little Peppers and How They Grew , and I read it with her . I wrote more frequently in my Unspoken Thoughts , not to hide what I thought from Jake , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study sessions had stopped . Ebon and Nettie had reached the point where Wanda and I were a hindrance to what they were learning . Once at dusk I thought I saw Jake 's face at the kitchen window . I ran out , but there was no one there . In my Unspoken Thoughts , I wrote , In the empty bed , the memory of sharp limbs and a penetrating twig is stronger than absence . " It 's the Watkins man again , " Tom said . " What 're you selling today , Tom ? " " I 'm giving , not selling , today . " Tom was born cheerful . His inside climate affected him more than what was outside . He had a wife who would n't sleep with him , a second woman who said she loved him but was going off to California , four stepladder children , a tedious job shoving feet into shoes , and still he was beaming.  | " Hey , " he said , " you still having unspoken thoughts ? " " None from you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud . " ' It was as natural as yawning and as hard to hold back . He was a rascal , it was plain to see , and took about the same pride in what he was doing as an Indian in scalping . ' That me ? " " You 're a rascal , are n't you ? " " Sure . And you 're my boss 's wife , ai n't you ? That makes us both rascals . " " And neither of us started out to be . " " Did we hurt anyone ? Not Nora . Nor that shitepoke , your hus-band . " " Ourselves , maybe ? " " Nope . I do n't buy that , either . Look at your present , why do n't you ? " The present was in an envelope I hesitated to open . " O.K. I 'll do it for you . Two one-way tickets : Cincinnati to Los Angeles , leaving November 11 , Pullman berth included . That 's the only way you 're ever going to get started . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred : you 'll get soft-hearted , burn your books , tell Jake to come home , and , for lack of any juice in your life , you and me 'll be sneaking off together again . " " Where 'd you get the money , Tom ? " " I did n't rob any bank . " " I 'll pay you back out of the five hundred . " " That wo n't be necessary . " " The eleventh . That 's only ten days away . " " That 's enough time to pack , ai n't it ? " " You really want to get rid of me , do n't you ? " " You 've already left me , Orpha . I 'd rather think of you in Californiathan here . " Nothing is so dear as what you 're about to leave . I had never had California fever . I liked snow and wind and thunderstorms . I had n't longed to go where it was always summer , where oranges and lemons and apricots grew instead of apples and pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't blowing away . Crops weren'tp214bringing the money they once had , but California was no exception . Joe wrote that they were burning oranges in California to keep from flooding the market . I spent that last ten days like someone under a death sentence : someone saying good-bye to life . I went to the Dudley farm , of course . I touched the table where Lon and I had studied , the bed where we had slept , the stone that marked the place where Lon 's bones lay . I sat on the front porch , where I was still able to see  --  or perhaps only imagine  --  the faded spot from which Lon 's blood had been scrubbed . There the last of the living Lon had spilled , there he had spoken his last words . Ebon came to talk to me about the furnishings I wanted shipped on to California , including the swinging lamp . " Everyone in California has electricity , " said Ebon . " I want it for its looks . The grafting table , too . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why I want it . " " I know . " " Can you run two farms ? " " Nettie 'll help . " " She 'll run you , too , if you do n't watch out . " " I 'm willing . " " You wo n't be another Lon with her ? " " That 's all gone , long ago . It was gone the night you married Jake . Could n't you tell ? " " It was n't a good time for me to notice anything like that . " Ebon left me alone on the porch . He knew why I was there . Tickets for November 11 must surely have been by chance ? Whoknew and remembered that date ? How many years ago ? Ten ? I putmy palms on the porch floorboards where Lon 's blood had fallen . Farewell to Lon , farewell to youth.  | " I 'll miss you , " Mama said at the station , " but it will be a happy lonesome . You 'll be with Joe and you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train that is bearing you away has not the sad sound of the whistle you hear as you lie in your bed at home . In your bed that whistle says , " Farewell , far away , gone forever . " In your bed on the train , it says , " Here we come , here we come . " We boarded the train laden , even though the bulk of our belongingswas in the baggage car : two trunks and Pussy in a box with cat-sized portholes . Mama had packed two baskets of food . That food lasted until we reached New Mexico . The prices in the dining car made me willing to fast . I would no more have entered the club car than I would have gone into a saloon . We were traveling coach , there was no air conditioning , and soot blew in the open windows . At night from our berth we watched the East become the West . We kept the curtains open and saw movies enacted just for us . At one stop , a cat came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an expected handout by the brakeman . A soldier home from some war ( where were we fighting in 1932 ? ) was hugged to death by a large family . A lone man put a wreath on a coffin before it was loaded into a baggage car . We spent four hours in the station in Chicago . At midnight , perhaps in Missouri , a bride and groom were showered with rice by their friends and were so taken up with saying farewell to a crying mother , they almost missed the train . The conductor yanked them up the steps just in time . In New Mexico at a whistle stop I bought us a Mexican flapjack called a " tortilla " and for Wanda a beaded Indian headband . " When we get to California , " she said , " I 'll find an eagle feather to put in it and be a real Indian . " " You 're already a Kickapoo . " " What 's it Kickapoo ? "  | " Mama 's papoose . " On the last night we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and California . We did n't sleep . The great white snow peaks reared up as sleep-disturbing as a shout . " It 's like the ground trying to hit us , " said Wanda . " It 's the world trying to push people off . " " Is it California yet ? " " Not till tomorrow . " " Will Uncle Joe meet us ? " " He said he 'd be there with bells on . " He was there , though when he saw us , I think he did n't feel like ringing any bells . It was one of those late November days when the temperature in Los Angeles reaches ninety and a Santa Ana wind has taken every bit of moisture out of the air . Joe was in his shirt sleeves . So was everyone else , except for women who were in sleeveless dresses . To me they looked like people who had heard a fire siren and had rushed outside without bothering to put on street clothes . Wanda and I were dressed for travel , winter travel : wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fashionable then , though ours were bought for warmth , not fashion , since they could be pulled down over the ears . What was wrong with me ? I had Joe 's word that California was the land of eternal summer . Did I think it was a myth ? So there we were , Joe 's relatives from back east , looking like Eskimos , Eskimos with two battered trunks , two lunch baskets , and a squalling cat . If he was taken aback at our appearance , he did n't show it : hugs and kisses for everybody but the cat . " Orpha , I told you you 'd be in California someday , did n't I ? Hello , Wanda . Hello , cat . Take off your coats , everybody , or you 'll melt before I get a good look at you . Not you , cat ; you 'll just have to sweat it out . " If Joe had n't known us , I might not have recognized him at first sight . In the days of his fever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so visible you expected to hear them clank as he walked.  |p219A  person who loses weight appears to have become more than usually visible . Weight gained is a disguise . Joe was n't fat . But he was no longer a thin black-haired rakehell with a consumptive 's burning cheeks . He had gone from 135 to 175 pounds , his skin was brown , and his expression was as loving as his words . I had grown accustomed to taking everything with a grain of salt , to expecting nothing and not being disappointed . Here was Joe , who said God had cured him , and something surely had ; who said it was eternal summer in California , and if this was n't summer , it was a furnace ; who said he wanted to preach love , and if he could preach love as well as he was practicing it with us , he would be eloquent . Joe had a little truck he called a " pickup , " which easily held all our paraphernalia in the back and the three of us plus Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your arms if you take it out of its cage ? " " Oh , yes , " said Wanda , who had been on her knees talking through the portholes to Pussy . " Better be sure . Once she starts running in this town , she 's gone forever . Cat hamburger in two minutes , likely . " Wanda was right . Poor Pussy clung to her like a baby raccoon to its mother . The three of us  --  four , counting the cat  --  sat in the front seat jammed tight and sweating . We headed north along what is now Sepulveda . Once outside the city , Joe pulled off the road . " Have a look at the land you have come to , " he said . " Land , " he called it , not state or county or city . It had once been that , a land with a flag of its own , a government of its own . It was plain old U.S.A. now , but the mountains and sea had n't changed since Pio Pico or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because the Santa Ana had been blowing , the air was unusually transparent . To our right were the mountains , to the left the sea . The mountains , in spite of the heat in the valley , already wore their wintertime topping of snow . They were not menacing like those sky-bangers we had seen in the night . They had been devised not to threaten people but as a picturesque background for a palm-tree city . They were stately and pretty , like lacy white crochetingaround a flat tablecloth . Joe named each peak for us , beginning with the smallest : Lowe , with its observatory ; ' Wilson , with its mountain homes ; Baldy , barren and glistening , a mountain 's moun/tain . Wanda and I stared and stared . In the East the earth had its ups and downs . Now here above desert heat snow and only an hour 's drive away . " We could bring a truckload of it home in a couple of hours , " Joe said . " Let 's go , " said Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys , " said Joe . " Let 's mix them up , " said Wanda . " They wo n't mix , " Joe told her . " They 've got it in for each other . " Far , far to the east floated a dreamlike shape , another mountain , Joe said . We had to take his word for it . It was scarcely visible . Between eyeblinks it disappeared . The Spanish had named it for a saint , and that , like many things Spanish , had endured the waves of English-speaking invaders . South was the Pacific . At sundown it was a stretch of glitter . Catalinarode it like a long gray tanker . Joe gave us all these peaks , the snow , and the sea like personal gifts from Joseph Chase , Californian , to two poor benighted Easterners . " That 's enough time for rubbernecking , " he said , and headed his pickup into the San Fernando Valley , where he lived . The valley was one big orchard : peaches and apricots and English walnuts ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do olives and oranges . Dates , however , grow in gardens , in neither groves nor orchards . From that very first night , the California landscape began to speak to me . Perhaps it was because it was Joey 's home . Perhaps it had been calling to me for a long time , the way the ocean calls to a prairie boy who , after twenty years , makes his way to the sea and ships , hunting , though he does n't know it , the thunder of waves he has never seen . We reached Joe 's at the beginning of Southern California 's short twilight . Joe called his home a bungalow . Back east we would have called it a shack , it was put together with so little regard for weatherproofing . Stained redwood , with a big screened porch for sleeping on summer nights , it did n't look bad . The house was set in the back yard of a peach grower 's place . Itp221had been built for a Japanese couple who worked for the Standfieldswhen the Standfield children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Joe rent-free in return for a little yard work . Joe , at that time , was finishing his studies at Valencia Park before being recorded as a minister in the Religious Society of Friends . Perhaps my feeling for trees is the same as my feeling for people . I love individuals but hate crowds . At the back of Joe 's bungalow was a pepper tree almost as big as the house itself . A pepper tree is a mass of lacy paper-whispering leaves decorated with clumps of red berries . It is a year-round Christmas tree , more inviting than an evergreen from a dark northen forest . I loved that tree , its look , its sound , and its usefulness . There was a platform in it , built , I suppose , for the Standfield children . The platform was large and secure enough to hold me . I often sat on it , feeling like a lace-curtain Irishwoman gazing out through the whispering leaves . On the evening of our arrival Wanda was up and on it before we got into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes closed . After that the talk started . Now I reach the troublesome part of this story . I 've already written part of it disguised as fiction . It was my first piece of published writing . All names were changed ; though Joe , on account of the publicity he had received , was immediately recognized . I was n't in that story ; there was nothing in that novel about the arrival of an Eastern sister or of Joe 's life in the Standfields ' gardener 's cottage . So I am not now duplicating any part of my earlier book . I have not opened that early novel for twenty-five years . Thus , episodes now forty years old will , with the changed perspective time gives , constitute , I hope , an entirely different story . I gave that novel as a title the hero 's name Talbot Ware . On my first evening in California , Talbot was not yet dreamed of ; I was not yet a writer ; Joe was not yet a preacher , except as an unrecorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . That night we were just brother and sister reunited after long separation and with much to talk about ; so much , the talk took all night . I probably would not remember that room at all except that it was so strange to me , a combination of Japanese and early California.  |p222The  California touch was the portiere of eucalyptus cups between dining and sitting rooms . There were many such in early California . I doubt that any could now be found except in a museum . The Oriental reminders are still common , wares that can be bought in San Francisco and Los Angeles : a grass rug , teacups without handles , silk hangings embroidered with herons and iris , that fat big-bellied god of good fortune . A breeze off the ocean stirred the glass pendants of a Japanese wind chime . The Santa Ana had died down , and cool damp air had changed burning desert to cool coastland . Joe and I sat in wicker rockers pulled close together so that we could hold hands . It was sweet to have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Our first talk of course was of Papa and Mama : " Are they well ? How hard hit are they by the Depression ? What do they think of my change of churches ? " What they thought was what I thought . Why ? Born a United Brethren . Become a Presbyterian because of the man whose faith saved his life ; that I could understand . But why a Quaker ? What I knew of them was next to nothing . Queer people , akin to Shakers or Mennonites , using a locution of their own , wearing clothes unlike those of others , refusing to fight , drink , smoke , hang pictures on their walls , or listen to music . I looked at Joe , this big brown man , onetimeinvalid , poisoner of a dog-poisoner , girl-chaser . " Why , Joe ? " " Because I love God . " I did n't yet know it , but Joe could talk about his love of God with less inhibition than most men can talk about their love for their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than most men love their wives and he was also a better talker than most men , Lon excepted . " Did n't you love God when you were a United Brethren ? Or a Presbyterian ? " " Of course I did . But more things got in the way of pure love there . " " Like what ? " " Getting baptized . Getting confirmed . Loving when the governmentsaid to ; killing when the government said to . " I understood " killing when the government said to . " That wasp223war . What was " loving " on the government 's say-so ? It was marriage , according to Joe . " Marriage is n't the government 's business or the church 's , either . " " Not the church 's ? How could you get married without a church ? " " All it takes for a marriage is a man , a woman , and God . That'sall a church is , anyway . Men and women representing God . " " No women preachers . " " Quakers have them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of God and some relatives , if they want to invite them , say to each other , I , Mary , take thee , John . ' " " Is that the way you 're going to get married ? " " I wo n't be getting married . " " You sound like a priest . " " The Catholics have some good ideas . Not getting married if you are going to be a preacher is one of them . " " Paul said , It is better to marry than to burn . ' " " Lon taught you a lot , did n't he ? Well , I 'm not burning . And Paul ought to have known from experience that true God-love does n't leave room for woman-love . One 's a little bonfire , the other 's a great sun-blaze . " " Are you a preacher already ? " I did n't tell him he sounded like it . " I have n't been recorded yet . " " Recorded ? What does that mean ? " " Churches ordain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers or priests certify you . Men do it , not God . " " What does the Quaker church do ? " " Quakers do n't have a church . We have a Meeting House , and we 're a religious society . If a Quaker feels the call of God to be a minister , the Society records the fact . It 's between you and God , and all the Society does is to recognize the call and make a record of it . " " Could I be a recorded minister ? " " If God called you . " " If all a Quaker has to do is say , God wants me to preach , ' I think you 'd get some real nuts . " " We do . That 's why I 'm going to the Institute . A man ought at least to have studied the Bible and know something about Quakerismbefore he gets recorded . " " Loving God is n't enough ? "  | " It 's the chief thing . But if a man 's going to preach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be just love , love , love . " I 'd heard sermons that were more and worse but I did n't tell Joey so . " I thought Quakers believed in silent worship . " " In California , " Joey said , " they talk . " I was having unspoken thoughts again , not bad ones , not ones I needed to write down in order to rid myself of them . I thought when Joey said that , You have come to the right place . I could n't learn all there was to know about Joe and the Institute and Quakers and California in one night , and Joe knew it . It was after midnight when he stopped talking and said , " Say , did we have any supper ? " " I did n't . I do n't know about you . " " I laid in a supply . I got to talking and forgot it . " We sat quietly for a minute or two , listening to the wind chimes and the pepper tree 's papery rustle  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wanda . " " She snores like a grown woman . " " Wanda , " I told Joey , " is worn out with travel and excitement . I never heard her make that sound before . " " Now do n't get your dander up , " Joe said . " She can snore like a horse for all of me . " " A horse ! " Joe , who had been on his way to the kitchen for our forgotten supper , knelt by my chair . " Look , Sis , I 've been waiting for this for years . You 're worn out , too . And starved . You 'll feel better when you get something in your stomach . " " What 's chiefly wrong with me , Joey , is a sick headache . " " You 've never outgrown them ? " " I 've just grown them bigger and better . " " What happened to you and Jake has n't helped . " " What happened was good for headaches . A pain in the head helps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you asked God for help ? " " I would n't bother Him with a headache . " " Do you like to have headaches ? " " If you ever had one of these , you would n't ask that . " " Do you think God wants you to suffer ? " " He can stop it any time He wants to . "  | " Do n't talk that way , Orpha . " " Well , He can , ca n't He ? " " Maybe He has , thousands of times . This time , have the grace to ask Him . " I did n't think He would . I did n't want to undermine Joe 's faith by my failure . Joe said , " I have faith if you do n't . If I ask God to take away your pain , He will . Close your eyes . " Joe put his hand on my forehead . I closed my eyes for a second , then opened them . Joe 's eyes were closed and he was speaking , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heaven in the sky . He was speaking to someone close to him , someone toward whom he lifted his radiant face . He saw with eyes closed what I could n't see with eyes open . What I saw in Joe 's face took my mind completely away from the pain in my head . Nor did Joe ask about it when he opened his eyes ; nor did I speak of it . It was not only gone , it was also forgotten . For a minute or two after he stood , Joe was like a man awake but still remembering a happy dream . Then he said , " I 've got something for you to eat I bet you never tasted before . Salami . " " Never even heard of it . What is it ? " " Wait and see . " Joe had written me that he did n't want a wife but did need a housekeeper . No woman with sense would have been willing to marry Joe . He was good , he was loving , he was witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman for him was just a part of God 's world . I can report accurately what Joe did ; I can report only what I think he thought . The saints , and I think Joe was one , live in their acts , not in another 's words . As to needing a housekeeper , Joe was absolutely right . He had given up eating cooked meals . He had given up changing the sheets regularly . He washed dishes once a week . Slicing salami and cheese did n't involve pots and pans or even a serving dish . A week 's accumulationof dirty dishes was meager . Joe swept when he felt the need of exercise . Litter so t hick he stunthlcd over it did cause himp226to take the grass rugs out and shake them . His life as a householder was perfectly adjusted to his overwhelming preoccupation . God had lifted him above dust , above taking the eyes out of potatoes before boiling them or of seeing that magazines were stacked . Clutter probably never hurt anyone , and Joe 's diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready-cooked meats , he added California fruits and nuts . He drank goat milk because someone had given him a goat and she had to be milked . He bought whatever looked appealing and did n't have to be cooked and cost little . I could n't change overnight to a diet of Monterey Jack and alligatorpears ; though Joe told me that in Biblical times holy men had lived in perfect health on a diet of locusts and honey . For Wanda 's sake and mine , I served cooked meals . Joe ate hush puppies , dried beef gravy , and soda biscuits with complete calmness . I even tried a pufHe on him . From any comment he made , it might have been a locust leg , and possibly was no better . I was busy until Christmastime getting Wanda started to school and trying to fit my Eastern belongings into Joe 's house of straw matting and embroidered herons . They did not fit . It was like putting a mouse in a spider web . Only the books looked at home with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bought by Lon . Joe had at least two hundred , many selected to meet the needs of groups who met at his home : Mexicans learning to speak English ; Quakers filling their tanks ( in Joe 's words ) with fuel to keep their Inner Lights burning ; pedants wanting more knowledge ; admirers of Joe wanting nothing but to be with him as often as possible . I have called Joe a saint . The term depends , of course , on your view of the meaning of sanctity . I think that it takes more than goodness to make a saint . First of all , a saint has a closer relationship with God than other men . God speaks to him in words the saint can hear and can report to others . The saint is holy because he is in direct touch with holiness . He is lovely because he knowsp227God , who is Love . Because the saint is at one with God , God 's power is in him and he is God 's willing instrument . Many saints have died rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowingall of this . Family vanity or personal love play no part in my belief . I have read the lives of Saint Joan , Saint Anthony , Saint Theresa , Saint Thomas More , and many others . I may be wrong , but I am not unknowing . By Christmas the settling-in was complete . I had made clothes for me and Wanda that suited the California climate , which was , compared with any weather I had known , neither summer nor winter . Christmas itself was no chore . I use that word on purpose because I think it has become so for many people today . In the home of Joseph Chase , Quaker , Christmas was scarcely noticeable . Joe believed that the celebration of Christ on any particular day , especiallyon a date as uncertain as that of His birth , encouraged people to forget Him on other days . Christ was for every minute of every life . Sundays , Christmases , Easters , were devices used to justify forgetfulnessof Christ on other days . So in Joe 's house , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cheer . " I was not then and have never become a Quaker . Not because I believe that the United Brethren have chosen a better religious way than the Friends . I am a United Brethren because I was born and brought up a United Brethren . If I had been brought up a cannibal , I would probably still be one , unless they themselves had expelled me as unworthy . As I have said , I can be left , and have been , but leave I can not . So my first Christmas in California was after the Quaker fashion , not because of personal conviction , but out of respect for Joe 's beliefs . There were two lapses from Quakerly practice , only one of which Joe knew about . I did n't tell Joe that on Christmas Eve I had filled a stocking of Wanda 's with candy : gumdrops , jellybeans , peppermintlozenges . I did n't think Wanda would be a better Christian if she received no candy on Christmas Eve . My other lapse was perfectly open . I cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw , precooked , or workaday . Joe had ins ited his Mexican class , or at least the six most faithful members , to have Christmas dinner with us . The festive touch was obvious inp228what was on the table : roast turkey , candied yams , a plum pudding steamed in punctured Hills Brothers coffee cans . A man who thinks he can digest grasshoppers is n't impressed by turkey , however brown and tasty . He is n't repulsed by it , either . Joe ate his fair share of all . The turkey was paid for by me  --  and that meant paid for out of Jake 's five hundred dollars . Where was Jake having his Christmas dinner ? I did n't wish him with us . I did , while Joe returned silent thanks , thank God that I was where I was . And I did pray for Jake 's well-being . Joe hoped to be recorded as a minister sometime after the first of the year . I visited some of the classes at the Valencia Park TrainingSchool myself . Visited , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a preacher or a missionary . Since I had difficulty in making changes in my own life , I knew that I was not fitted to tell other people how to change theirs . Joe did n't have that trouble . He had changed himself and for the better . So he had not only the right , but also the duty as a follower of God , who had said , " I will bring the blind by a way they know not . I will make darkness light before them , and crooked things straight . " I heard many returned missionaries speak . The Training School was proud of the number of its former students who were now in Guatemala , China , Cuba , Alaska , bringing the gospel to natives . My memory of the report of the husband and wife home from Alaska no doubt tells more about me than about Valencia Park missionaries . This couple 's greatest accomplishment , in their own eyes , lay in their persuading the Eskimos they ministered to to give up reindeerracing . Or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , because the Eskimos bet on the outcome . At the end of the report by this earnest man and his wife , I felt very sorry for the Eskimos . In my opinion , they would soon find another reason for betting . It was also my belief that a Christian training school should prepare its students for more important work than the separation , during the long Arctic nights , of elk and Eskimo.  |p229For  the most part , until the first of the year , I watched the weather change . I had believed with other newcomers from the East that California had no seasons . It was the land of eternal summer ; summermay be nice , but an unending summer would be monotonous . Back east we had fall when the leaves change color . Then we had winter  --  icicles , white snow , and glare-ice . Finally , but very slowly , color again , rising temperatures , and thunderstorms . In California , rain rings in the seasonal change . Wanda and I had arrived in the midst of a November heat wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fry an egg on the sidewalk , or the hood of your car . Then , one night , I do n't know whether it was the sound or the smell that awakened me . It was raining ! A drumming on the cedar shingles ; the smell of a thirsty land drinking . The rainy seasonhad come ! In California , there are n't year-long showers and driblets , with occasional cloudbursts . Just the four-month lowering of a crystal curtain of raindrops . And afterward , really during , more colors than Eastern woods lots ever show . The brown foothills turn green . No autumn leaf has as many colors as has a field of lupine , mariposa lilies , mustard , Indian paintbrush , yellow violets , Californiapoppies . Compare the slope of a foothill ablaze with the colors of these flowers with the dying-leaf color of a woods lot . No season ? No colors ? I was doing nothing but watch the rain fall , the way I might have watched snow eddies back east , when the President of the Valencia Park Training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . Wanda was at school . Joe was off in Woolman , where , as assistantto the pastor , he had charge of the young people 's meetings . I asked the Reverend Ellsworth in . He was standing in the rain ; like other Californians , he did n't seem to mind it . No galoshes , no umbrella , no raincoat ; soaked but happy . The ritual of baptism must have been born in a dry land . Rain in a dry country means life . Baptism , man-made rain , means life everlasting . Quakerism , with its disregard for baptism , got its start in rainy England , where water is nothing but a nuisance . The Reverend Ellsworth came in and stood , dripping . I got him away from the grass rug . After he had dried off a little , he sat . J. Purvis Ellsworth ( lid not look like a Quaker ; or a preacher of any denomination whatsoever . He was large , slab-sided , red-haired . I had heard him preach and knew that he could do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accustomed as I was to thinking of Quakers as silent , the Reverend Ellsworth had been a shock . He did n't leap onto the pulpit like a Billy Sunday or wear eye-catching costumes like Aimee . He looked and talked like what he was : an oil driller who had found Jesus Christ and wanted to take the good news of that discovery to the world . He was n't Joe 's equal as a preacher . He had had no education . He was capable of persuading but he could n't charm . Certainly no one slept while J. Purvis Ellsworth preached . His phrasing was sometimes peculiar . He had been born in Texas ; he spoke in a loud ringing heartfelt way . In the Bible , God spoke out of a burning bush . In the pulpit J. Purvis Ellsworth was , with his crest of flaming red hair , the burning bush itself . George Fox , who was himself a bit of a ranter , would n't have taken the Reverend Ellsworth 's preaching amiss . " Joe is at Woolman , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsworth told me . " I 've seen you at Meeting . I thought I 'd stop by and have a little chat with you . Myrtle would 've come , but five kids do n't leave her much time for visiting . You 're a United Brethren , Joe tells me . " " I am , Reverend Ellsworth . " " Do n't call me that . Friends do n't take any stock in titles . Not even Mister and Missus . You 're Orpha Hesse to me , and I 'm Purvis Ellsworth . As a matter of fact , what 's the point of the doublebarreledhandles ? If you say Purvis , I 'll know who you 're talking to . And Orpha ought to do the same for you . Now , I 'm not here to talk down the United Brethren . They 're fine people . Wo n't fight any more than we will . Believe in sanctification , the same as we do . " Saying " Purvis " instead of " Reverend Ellsworth " made me gulp a little , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Brethren all my life , but I never have really understood what sanctification means . " Purvis told me about sanctification  --  and a lot more besides . At the Training School , he said , they preached the " Four-fold Gospel " : Salvation , Sanctification , Healing by Faith , and the Second Coming of Christ . Sanctification was being " twice born . " The first birth was when you were converted . Then , through the grace of God , you were " sanctified , " so faith-filled that sin was no longer possible . " Is that what sanctified means ? Unable to sin ? " " Yes . " " Ca n't you sin ? "  | " No . All evil in me , all tendency to evil , was taken from me and nailed to the cross . " " How do you know this is true ? Have you ever tried to sin ? Maybe you could if you tried . " " Orpha , Orpha , that 's flighty . I 'm glad Brother Joe ca n't hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine God wanting to try to sin ? " " It 's probably sinful even to try to imagine such a thing . " The Reverend Ellsworth nodded . " Now do you understand sanctification , Orpha ? " " How do you know when you 're sanctified ? " " Would n't you know if God completely filled your heart so that all knowledge of past sin left your heart and  --  " " Yes , if that happened , I would know it . " " And if all temptation to sin again was crucified on the cross of Jesus ? You 'd know that , would n't you ? " " If that happened , I would n't know myself . " " You would n't know your old self , that 's all . " " Does Joe believe all of this ? " " Certainly . He 's studying to be a preacher , is n't he ? No one would be recorded by the Meeting as a preacher who did n't believe in sanctification . Oh , Joe believes , all right . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray together before I leave . " Purvis got down on his wet knees , leaned on a chair , and prayed . He did not pray in silence , as I had believed Quakers did , but vocallyand at length . What he was praying for was a second birth for me . I felt that it would n't happen . The person I pitied was Purvis , not me . He might doubt his own sanctification if he was n't able to bring about through prayer a second birth in me . Wanda came home from school and , bright girl that she was , knelt down by a chair and put her face in her hands . I wanted to save the Reverend Ellsworth the effort and the disappointmentof his praying . I wanted to say , " Do n't pray for sanctificationfor me . It will never happen . I 'll always be able to sin . " I could n't do it . It 's rude to interrupt a speaker at any time , let alone when he 's in the midst of prayer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he rose and looked at me very closely . He saw it had n't happened . I was no more sanctified than before he had prayed . For a minute I think he wished he was back amidst thep232oil rigs . He put his hands on Wanda 's head  --  she was still kneeling  --  and said , " God be with both of you till we meet again . " Joe was delighted when he got home to hear that we had been visited by the head of the school he was attending . " Purvis is a fine man . He was making all kinds of money as a driller before his conversion . He kissed the money good-bye without a thought when the call came to preach . What did you talk about ? " " The Training School . " " Did he tell you he founded it ? " " No . He talked about its beliefs . " " You did n't hear anything new , did you ? They 're about the same as every other Meeting in Southern California . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what Purvis called it ? I believe I am saved . I believe Christ will come again . I have to believe in faith healing . It 's God 's gift , and I have received it . You experienced it yourself . " " What about sanctification ? Do you believe in that ? " " Sanctification is n't something you believe in . It 's something you experience . " " Have you ever experienced it ? " " No . I pray for it . " " I do n't understand it . " " It 's not something for the head to understand . It 's a soul matter . When you 're saved , God forgives your past sins . When you 're sanctified , you 're filled with the Holy Ghost and the desire to sin leaves you . " " Purvis said that after you were sanctified , you could n't sin . Do n't you think Purvis can sin ? " " I think he might do something that people might call a ' sin '  --  but that God would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth and sanctification , no one could be recorded as a minister . Is that true ? " " That 's true . " " In two weeks you go before the Elders to ask to be recorded . Will they ask you about sanctification ? " " Yes . " " What if it has n't happened ? "  | " It 's the result of God 's grace . It can be the work of a second . It could happen while they 're asking me the question . " " What if it did n't happen ? " " I 'd tell the truth . It 'd be a sin not to . " " Maybe you 're already sanctified , Joey , and do n't know it . " " Do n't joke about this , Orpha . I 'm not , and I want to preach . I have to . Pray for me , Sis . " I could n't pray that Joe would be unable to sin ; and I could n't tell him that I could n't . Not telling  --  that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable . My unhappiness could not in any way have equaled Joey 's . He , who had been called by God to preach , was in danger of being denied the right to preach . Would he have to believe , as the Elders did , that a God who had n't taken from him the ability to sin would n't approve him as a minister ? Joey did n't complain . He took care of all his duties as assistant to the Woolman pastor . He walked a lot . He prayed a lot . He seemed to have lost the ability to swallow food . He did n't sleep much . I suffered for Joe . I suffered for myself . I did not believe that ( human beings should consider themselves incapable of sin ; and I mould not talk to Joe about this and perhaps make what he longed for more difficult to attain . I tried to keep life normal for Wanda . Joe ( lid , too . He played one-a-cat with us . He tried to hide his loss of appetite from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silent prayer at the table . For the first time since I had been in California , I got out my Unspoken Thoughts book . I had thoughts I could n't speak to Joe or Wanda that I wanted to get out of my mind . My Unspoken ' I Knights were written as statements . Were they really questions ? Or prayers ? Did I write them expecting to hear a heavenly contradiction if they were untrue ? I wrote : A man who can not sin would need to have God 's wisdom as well as God 's sanctity . A man who believes that no act of his can be sinful can become , with a clear conscience , a second Satan.  |p234Have  the world 's worst men been men who believed that their acts were not sinful ? Did Jesus himself ever say that He could not sin ? Is n't " will not " better than " can not " ? Why not live day by day ? Instead of believing that God has given you a lifetime immunity from sin , why not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who knows what sin is ? In my book Talbot Ware , the novel I wrote that was based closely upon Joe 's experience , what came next in his life is reported in detail . That book was centered about one person , Talbot Ware ; a character representing Orpha Chase and her misadventures played no part in it . Another full account of Joey 's meeting with the Board of Elders would be repetitious for readers of Talbot Ware . What happened was this : the Elders  --  there were women as well as men on the Board  --  questioned Joe as to his desire to preach , his past , his present beliefs . I could have gone . I did n't . I knew the anguish Joe had experienced during the past two weeks . I knew that it would reach a peak during the inquisition ( which it was n't , of course , though that was how I thought of it ) . I did n't want to witness the ordeal . The Meeting was on a Saturday afternoon in mid-January . The rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crests of Lowe , Wilson , and Baldy glistened with snow . Joe , who had been praying instead of sleeping , thinking instead of eating , had dark circles under his eyes , and his big shoulders had taken a forward bend I had never seen before . " Pray for me , Orpha , " he said again before he left . I did . Not the prayer that he wanted . Not " Lord , sanctify Joe and make it impossible for him to sin again . " I prayed , " Lord , help Joe to do what is right . " God knew what that was better than Purvis or the Elders . Wanda , because it was Saturday , was out of school . She wanderedaround , aware , in the way she had , that something was wrong . A mother 's first duty is to her child . I 'd better trust Joe to God and pay some attention to Wanda.  | " Let 's play jacks , Wanda . " Wanda loved this game and so did I. She could beat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Uncle Joe , Mama ? " " Nothing . " That was a lie , so I added , " He 's worried . " " About being a preacher ? " " Being a preacher does n't worry him . It 's taking the examination beforehand . " " Does n't he know the answers ? " " Yes . " " Then he 's O.K. , is n't he ? " " He 's O. K. " " Mama , I have a surprise for you . Do you want to see it ? " " Ca n't wait . " Wanda went into her room and brought out my old long-forgotten switch . I handled it gingerly . " I thought I left that in Amesville . " " You did . I hid it in my keepsake box . " " Why ? Do you like me better when I wear it ? " " No . I thought Papa might come and you would want it . " " Papa is n't coming and I should never have worn it in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We did . In the fireplace . It was real hair , and the smell was of a blacksmith shop where horses have had their hooves trimmed and the trimmings have been thrown in the fire . Not a pleasant smell . I lair is too near bones and flesh for that . For some reason , perhaps because of the scented hair ointment I had put on it to give it a sheen , the hair smoldered for a long time . The scent of burning hair was still in the room when , just at d , n k , Joe came home . Ile did not have to tell me what had happened . He was not sanctilied . He could still sin . He had told the truth . He had not become a recorded minister . And he was not unhappy . He was , in fact , radiant . " Listen , you two , " he said . " I was so determined to be whatever Valencia Park and Purvis believed was right , I almost stopped trying to know God 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man capable of sinning , but not sinning . " I hat is God 's will for me . " And never be able to preach ? " " No , no , I can preach . Quakers in the East do n't require sanc/tification . Presbyterians believe you can sin at the drop of a hat . " " Are you going to be a Presbyterian now ? " Joe went leaping around the room . " No , no . Of course not . Say , what smells so funny in here ? " " My hair . " " Did you catch on fire ? " " No . My switch . " " I did n't know you had one . " " I had one . I wore it because Jake did n't like short hair . " " What good did that do ? You kept your short hair . " " I hid my bob with it . I looked long-haired . Now I am what I look like . " " Me , too . I look like a man who can sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wo n't . God willing , I wo n't . " " Not sinning is n't much of a career , " I said . " A baby is capable of that . " " I told you , I told you ! Did n't I ? I 'm going to preach . That 's a career . " " Where ? On a street corner like the Salvation Army ? " " That 's O.K. , too . But I 'm not . I 've got a Meeting House . " " A church ? " " Not a church , you United Brethren , you . A Meeting House . The first Quakers met out of doors or in each other 's homes . I 've got a Meeting House  --  a real house , a real place for meeting . The old one-room schoolhouse out at Ortiz . Seats still in . No pulpit , and I do n't want that anyway , but the teacher 's platform is still there , and a desk I can bang if I get to feeling emphatic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My congregation , Sis . Not everyone believes in sanctification . McGrew , who owns the land the schoolhouse is on and the one who 's loaning it , does n't . He 's got eight kids . Clarence Lindley does n't . Eula Perry . . . " " They do n't mind that you 're not recorded ? " " George Fox was n't recorded . " " What you 're doing is like secession , is n't it ? " " From Valencia Park , maybe . But there wo n't be any civil war , I can tell you that . Quakers have been having differences of opinion since the beginning . Hicksites . Wilburites . Orthodox . They 're allp237Quakers , just the same . Orpha , do you know , when they got to that final big question this afternoon , the one I could n't say yes to , the question I thought maybe a miracle would come in time to save me over ? Well , a miracle saved me . They asked the question . I could n't say yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood of  --  I do n't know what to call it  --  love ? Light ? I do n't know . Understanding ? I knew that I could sin , but with God 's help I would n't . That was enough to lift me off the ground . I mean it . I jumped for joy . I really did . Maybe they thought they had a Holy Roller on their hands . I did n't roll any , but I did jump and I did praise God . " " Valencia Park was probably glad to get rid of you . A hopping , jumping , shouting Quaker . " " I did n't shout any . " " Just quietly affirmed . " " No wonder they wanted to get rid of you at Fairmont , Sister . You 've got a saucy tongue . Do you know what I need ? Food ! Boy , I do n't think I 've had a bite for a week . I could eat a whetstone . I could eat a bar of Fels Naphtha soap . In the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . That was before I got a housekeeper who believed in cooking . " " Martha 's in the kitchen . This is Mary willing to listen to you tell me about sanctification . " " Me for Martha , " Joe said , and headed kitchenward . Wanda was making her specialty , oyster soup . It is easy to make  --  oysters , milk , a little thickened , butter , salt and pepper ; oysters , to Wanda , were the food of tycoons and potentates . Besides , think of eating an animal that could make a pearl . Think of eating anything as plump and slimy as an oyster . Soup was our whole supper , and for Joe , after a week 's fast , probahlya good thing . Hungry as he was , the thanks he returned before that meal were neither brief nor silent . What he had to say was spoken to God , not to us ; it was a continuing expression of the glory he had felt when it was revealed to him that he would not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God , since this revelation came from Him , must have known all about it . It was n't news to Him . It was news to Joe , though , and he could n't stop being thankful . I signaled to Wanda to start eating . Wanda , too polite to eat while someone was praying , never lifted a spoon.  |p238The  Ortiz Schoolhouse had never heard preaching like Joe 's . Nor had the San Fernando Valley , Los Angeles , or Southern California . Philadelphia Quakers would have been shocked by what went on ; but apart from the manner , the message was wholly of the Religious Society of Friends . Joe 's congregation soon outgrew the small one-room schoolhouse . Of those who attended , not more than half were Quaker . Joe was becoming a California phenomenon along with big trees , Hollywood , and the Rose Parade . He had no pulpit antics . He wore a plain sober-colored suit . His power was as mysterious as Houdini 's . Speeches ( sermons are speeches suited to Sundays ) are made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( most , wisely , are never collected ) , and it is difficult to believe that anyone ever had the patience to sit through them . Words spoken are more than words read . To the spontaneously spoken word is added the sound , the stance , the smell , and the body temperature of a speaking man . If words alone are what you want , do n't listen : read . The sermon has a topic more compelling than that of most speeches . It is saying more than " Vote for me , " " Support the bond issue , " " Visit New Zealand . " It has to do with subjects every human being wonders about : the meaning of life , the inevitability of death , the existence of heaven and hell , the nature of sin and forgiveness . Is there a God ? Did Jesus live ? Is death the end ? Will I see again those I have loved ? What must I do to be saved ? Let the words be commonplace , the preacher a stodgy fellow who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : if these are the questions he asks , we will listen to hear his answers . Joe was not stodgy ; his words were not commonplace . Possibly Joe would have been listened to if his message had been " Visit New Zealand . " He was easy to look at , big , brown , limber as Fairbanks duelling a villain ; sweet-voiced as Burton with a mouthful of Shakespeare . Beyond all that he was , in the pulpit , a man on fire . He did not speak in tongues , but his tongue spoke words and languages he had learned in realms we never visited : realms where all the answers are . Listeners came from as far away as Bakersfield and San Diego . Personal magnetism brings listeners . Mark Twain had it and Will Rogers and James Whitcomb Riley . They had listeners to subjects that were skim milk to Joe 's cream : politics ,  |p239travel  , humor , and rhyme . Compare those with " What shall I do to be saved ? " Politics , humor , travel , and rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried . He preached three-fourths of the Four-Fold Gospel : Salvation , Healing by Faith , the Second Coming of Christ . Salvation , or conversion , as it was more commonly called , was the goal of most churches in Southern California and elsewhere . The church provided a place of worship for believers . More important , it was a means of bringing nonbelievers to Christ . Services for the purpose of conversion were called " revivals . " A revival could be a pretty emotional , noisy affair . There was a good deal of crying , screaming , and shaking . Conversion was contagious , and the sight of one man coming down with it affected others . Joe wanted to bring men to Christ . A man might be of two minds about sanctification ; a man of two minds about conversion did n't belong in the pulpit . Nevertheless , Joe felt that God might he found without too much shouting . His own eloquence , conviction , love , thwarted this belief . Before a sermon of his was finished , worshipers , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mourner'sbench . Friends came with them to join in their prayers that they break through to glory . Husbands and wives were reunited there . Drunks knelt there and said farewell to their bottles . Men made the journey on their knees from the back of the Meeting House to the front . Neighbors , long-time feuders , met there , shook hands , and asked God to forgive them . I thought of the word Jake had torn from my book and I had burned . Perhaps Jake had influenced me more than I knew . These spasms , while holy , seemed unsuited for a public place . Joe did n't , as some evangelists do , take pride in the number of converts he made . He published no lists , gave out no figures . But he could n't , like a prissy schoolmarm , urge converts who were coming down front , crying and praying , " Come more quietly . " I went to many of Joe 's Meetings . Wanda went with me to the daylight meetings . She was nine years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was in the fifth grade , studying fractionsand the American Revolution . She knew all there was to know ( by human beings ) of sanctification , salvation , the Second Coming , and faith healing . She said her prayers as she had been taught top240do , but in Meeting and after she was quiet and composed ; the cornmotion of the converted , their tears , confessions , and prayers brought no response from her . What life was like to a ten-year-old in the household of someone who brought about these demonstrations , I do n't know . Like living in the house of a magician ? Toward the end of May , at a First Day Meeting  --  the Quaker term for Sunday worship  --  Joe was using as his text Matthew 7:7-11 . His theme that morning was both spiritual and physical . " Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you : For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why these texts happened to be the ones that so touched Wanda , I do n't know . I could feel her body trembling against mine as Joe at various points in his sermon repeated these texts . " Ask , and it shall be given . . . seek , and ye shall find . " As always in Joe 's sermons , the askers and seekers began to go , as the saying was , " up front . " Some went alone ; some with friends already saved who were praying for them . Wanda said , " Mama , Jesus wants me to go up front . " I thought it unnecessary . I thought she was caught up in the contagion that was affecting others . I was even un-Christian enough to wonder if Wanda 's desire was to a degree that of the onlooker who feels left out of the drama being enacted before his eyes . The young girl not only sees Juliet ; she wants to be Juliet . " Oh , Mama , " Wanda repeated , " Uncle Joe is calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " is reassuring the unsaved and the afflicted . " Wanda stood , her cheeks covered with tears . " Oh , come with me , Mama . " What could I do ? Total strangers were charitable enough to accompanytheir unsaved brethren to the altar . Would n't a mother accompany a daughter , moved by her uncle 's preaching , in her search for God ? I went , of course . I knelt . I put my arm around Wanda . I listened to Wanda pray . The sermon was continuing and the prayers of those kneeling up front were like the music that in those days accompanied emotional scenes in the movies . A grandmotherly woman kneeling beside Wanda clasped her closely . " Oh , break through to God , honey , break through . He is waiting for you . " At those words , Wanda said , " I have found ITim. "  |p241She  said no more until we were homeward bound in the runabout that had replaced the pickup . Then she said , " I have had a call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wanda would be overwrought after her experienceat Meeting . How could a ten-year-old hear a call to the foreign mission field ? Joe had no such fears . Ten-year-olds wanted to be movie stars , firemen , cowboys , toe dancers . Why not foreign mis-sionaries ? Joe was born to speak out , and look up . He wanted a church service quiet enough to hear him speak . Beyond that he did n't object to a little Amen-ing and Praise-the-Lording . Joe was too early for the " primal scream " therapy ; though the tears and groans and hallelujahs he called forth were n't too far removed from that vocalizing . He was n't afraid of touch , either . He picked up Wanda , and she was a load , kissed her first on one cheek , then on the other , gave her a little shake , and put her down . " It 's not just talk , you know , Wanda . You 've spoken up . You have borne witness . You 'll have to be an example now . People will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought . Ten is too early to start being an example . Wanda was a sturdy ten in every way and she accepted doe 's words as an expression of what she already knew . She was not usually an afternoon napper  --  but after dinner that Sunday , she curled up on the couch on the sleeping porch and slept . No snoring this time ; or if there was , Joe had learned that I was touchy on the subject . Joe was n't worried about Wanda and the foreign mission field . Time would take care of that one way or the other . He had a problem , one of his own , one that time was only making worse : healing . " I ca n't preach anything less than or different from what I find in the New Testament . I ca n't find a word there about being unable to sin . And even if it was there , and I did n't experience it , I could n't preach it . Healing is different . The New Testament is full of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not preach healing . " " he might believe it and preach it and not be able to do it . But that 's not you , Joey . You took my headaches away . " " Orpha , for God 's sake , I did n't take your headaches away . Jesus did . I had faith that Ilc would . I Ic preached healing . I could n't have clone your headaches as much good as a mustard plaster . If youp242an ' t understand that , how can I expect those who know a lot less about the Bible than you do to understand ? " Joe was always inclined to walk about when he talked . It was hard to keep him anchored behind a pulpit . He tramped back and forth in front of me , stopping when he had a question to ask . " O.K. What 's your answer ? To tell the truth , I did n't think you had one . I do n't have one myself . I 'm talking to myself and trying harder than usual to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " " Do ? Do what you 've been doing . You believe in healing and you can heal . " " I ca n't . I ca n't . How many times do I have to tell you ? People come to Meeting the way they go to a dentist . Stop the pain , Doc . ' I do n't blame them . I 've been sick myself . I would 've gone to a witch doctor . But what 's happening to the Meeting ? We do n't have a Meeting for worship any more . We have the Ortiz Phenomenon and his magic act . We have wheelchairs and crutches and tumors and running sores . People do n't come to Meeting to find Jesus . They come to get rid of pain . " " In the Bible people were healed and they found Jesus . " " Find Him ? How could they miss Him ? He was there . What they see now is the Ortiz Phenomenon . You do n't know how that galls me . " " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't shed your faith . You can lose it . But I have n't lost it . I said I believed I could sin . I can . Not a sin like this , though . Let a man suffer and die in order to have quiet Meetingsand get rid of that Ortiz nonsense . No , if that 's what it takes to be sanctified , I 'm sanctified . " Joe tramped . I was able to keep quiet . Wanda , her nap over , came into the living room . Joe paused mid-stride and picked her up . " When do we leave ? " he asked . " Leave ? " Wanda said . " For China ? " " You believed me , did n't you , Uncle Joe ? " " Of course I did . " " I have to wait until I grow up . " " I 'll be too old to go with you then . " Wanda rubbed her cheek against Joe 's . " You wo n't ever be too old , Uncle Joe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're too big to be making someone hold you . " " Too big and too hot , " Joe said , letting her slide to the floor . Joe did n't say a word to me but on his face there was a glint of something remembered . And where had I heard that tone of voice before ? And whose voice ? In my novel , the growth of Talbot Ware 's church and the moves from the Ortiz Schoolhouse to the unused intermediate building outside Montebello , then to the new Meeting House in Los Angeles are fully reported . This was virtually the same as Joe 's progress ; in Los Angeles he was still the Ortiz Phenomenon , even after he had moved into the Meeting House , a building that , though not as ornate as hers , held as many worshipers as Aimee Semple McPherson'sTemple . There he was , the Reverend Joseph Chase , minister of the Religious Society of Friends . The Valencia Meeting , clinging to their belief in sanctification , never recorded Joe as a minister  --  and Joe never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The La Puente Meeting , which had never made sanctification a requirement for its members or preachers , did record Joe . It was not his finally being recorded , or his eloquence , or his obvious love of God that filled Joe 's Meeting House to overflowing : it was the healing . Joe thought , prayed , and wrestled with himself and with God about this . He wanted worshipers at his Meetings , not men and women seeking relief from pain . " I feel like a snake-oil merchant , " he told me . " I feel like I give away aspirin . " " Does it matter what you feel ? " " Maybe not . But I 'd like to feel miserable for a better reason . I do n't cure those people . God does . When they praise me , I feel like a charlatan . " Happenings that were called " miracles "  --  and seemed miraculous  --  did occur at Joe 's Meetings . I saw some with my own eyes . What else should people expect who worshiped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him ? A Man who brought the dead to life , who was himself crucified , buried for three days , and after that broke out of Ilis tomb and lived to walk the earth again . Yet Christians who worshiped ( ; heist the Man of Miracles derided Joe.  |p244They  thought fakery of some kind was involved . They believed that ailments that could be psychologically induced  --  neuralgias , asthmas , headaches , tics  --  were susceptible of help or cure by Joe telling the sufferers that he had faith that Jesus would heal them . The popular medical term for such patients then was " hysterics . " But healing of the kind I saw , whatever the possible scientific explanations , was hard to accept as anything but the result of profoundfaith . As Joe prayed , I saw a girl 's leg , so twisted as to be three inches shorter than her normal leg , become by some process straightened . The girl had hardly been able to hobble up front . She walked away at the close of the service with only a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affidavit attesting to the fact that his former patient , who had not responded to any physicaltherapy , was now so improved as to be considered recovered . Joe , when he quietly declined to accept the affidavit personally , said , " I pray for healing . I am not the Healer . " Joe 's new Meeting House in Los Angeles was built in 1938 . By this time Joe , though still concerned about the compulsive public rush to healing , had made some decisions as to how to cope with it . First Day Meetings , morning and evening , were Meetings for worshiponly . This meant that Joe would not speak specifically of healingat those times . This did not mean that people were n't healed . You can not , Joe could not , preach the gospel of a Healer , of a Man who has practiced healing , without listeners experiencing healing . Nor could Joe persuade men and women who had been rid of afflictionsof long standing not to proclaim their joy and thankfulness . He tried . " For the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ for the first time , will those experiencing His grace most fully thank Him in the silence of their hearts ? " This meant in plainer words , " Please try to keep quiet until I have finished my sermon . " He announced that Meetings of prayer for healing would be held on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday evenings . He was not sure that this decision was a good one . The result was that there were evidentlymore people wanting to feel good than to he good . Thep245Meetings for worship continued to be well attended . The Meetings for healing were overflowing . He tried to lessen this overcrowding by saying that he would , at his home on Monday and Saturday afternoons , talk with individualswho had made arrangements with him . He would never on these afternoons see more than two or three persons . Joe preached medicine and surgery . Faith in the power of Jesus to heal did not mean lack of faith in those whose efforts were less spiritual . They also were sons of God . Joe was in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been proved a hoax , she was never again , in the thirties , as popular as she had been in the twenties . The blazing cross on the Angelus Temple , where she continued to preach the lour Square Gospel , still revolved , shedding a light that , when Joe came to Los Angeles , could be seen twenty-five miles out at sea . Aimee had in her Temple a " miracle room " stacked high with paraphernalia no longer needed by those she had cured : wheelchairs , crutches , trusses , spectacles , canes . Easterners , who tended to think all Californians weirdos ( though most Californians were transplants from the East and the Middle West ) , linked Aimee and Joe together in their minds . They should not have done so . Joe founded no new church . His large but plain Meeting House supported no cross , stationary or revolving . He preached in an ordinarybusiness suit . He had no miracle room . He urged those who had been healed to forget their past infirmities and to prove by lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus . Except for the size of his congregation and the number of persons who had personally sought to exploit their healing , Joe did not provide the papers with headlines like Aimee 's . Sex , not healing or numbers of worshipers , is what gives a preacher big black headlines . A thousand discarded crutches would not have given the Evening Express or the Examiner the headlines Ormiston and Carmelgave Aimee . And there were no Ormistons , male or female , in Joe 's life . No one was in a better position than I to know this . We had moved to a house on the outskirts of Montebello , and continued to live there even after Joe 's new Meeting House was built for hint in I.os Angeles . Our house was peculiar to begin with ; the location , as the influx of ( kits and Dust Bowlers increased dnr/ing the Depression , became even more peculiar . The land on the south side of the road , which ran between Los Angeles and the towns of Orange County , had been dairy country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its loft and pulley for storing hay , its ground floor with many stalls , stood near us . The dairy herd had diminished . A gas station , a couple of oil derricks , a half-dozen new but ramshackle houses took up the space where cows had once grazed . Our house , a raspberry-pink stucco that in the thirties was called " Spanish , " had belonged to the dairy manager . The new service station was a little farther away , on the other side of the road . An oil derrick was a quarter of a mile back of the house . Night and day we heard the gulp and thud of its pump lifting oil from the earth  --  a mother producing the food that the autos speeding toward the beaches and groves of Orange County needed to live . The house itself had five rooms . The large living room , separated only by an archway from the kitchen , had a " dining alcove , " or " breakfast nook . " All rooms , with the exception of the bathroom , were separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Spanish  --  and , for all I know , may be . Eucalyptus portieres would have given us some privacy and have lightened the effect of the heavy stucco arches . Eucalyptus trees had been planted as windbreaks on citrus land ; on dairy land , with nothing to protect but cows , they let the wind blow . Not that I would have had the patience to string togetherenough eucalyptus cups to curtain one door , let alone four . The only tree on the place was a weeping willow , dusty , forlorn , as melancholy to look at as its name . It was unclimbable , did not change color or provide any kind of a harp for the wind to play on . Apart from being green , which did rest the eyes in that bleached country , its only use was for Wanda , as a kind of Kickapoo hogan . Once under the dome of its branches , which touched the ground , she was as safe from prying eyes as in an underground vault . Wanda , at fifteen , was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never too old or too young to relish privacy , and this the weeping willow gave her . Joe , I think , would have been happy in a tent . He did notice and rejoice in the location of the raspberry stucco . It was in the midst of everything . Except for a Ferris wheel and a delicatessen , I do n't know what could have been added . " Orpha , " he said , " we are at the center of the world . " That was a fact , and the center every day was becoming more crowded . Joep247did n't care . Joe was a man in love . The fact that he was in love with God did n't make him much different from a man in love with a mortal . He was in love and his love was returned . Because of this , everyone , pumpers from oil wells , milkers from the dairy barns , me and Wanda , had a kind of dearness and radiance we would not otherwise have had . Joe came home from his Meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , snapped his suspenders , drank a cup of black coffee , and made merry . Strange phrase ? There is no other for it . How could a man be so lucky , he often asked me . Given three months to live , healed by faith , led to God , then given the power to lead others to Him . Men in the backwoods were soberer on sour mash than Joe on the love of God . It could have rubbed some the wrong way . A man in love , bubblingwith praise of his beloved , can be tiresome . His beloved , it is plain to everyone else , is no prize . Besides , the lover wants you to appreciate , not to share , his dear one . Joe was another kind of lover : he was happiest when others shared his love of God.  |p251It  was October , month of opals and topazes . The ruby blaze of Ji had faded . The long drought of summer would soon be broken the first rains . It was like finding a living spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel the rain coming , " Joe said . He was stretched out the davenport , finishing his coffee . " How ? " asked Wanda , hoping , I think , that God had whisper a forecast to him . " By my suspenders . They lose their snap when there 's moisti in the air . " He twanged them to show us the difference . It was true . Tf had lost their crisp crackle . " It 's the way you do it , " said Wanda . " Try it yourself , " Joe told her . Wanda leaned down , lifted a suspender as far as she could , th let it fall back . Nothing but a soggy plop . " Satisfied , " asked Joe , " that it 's the weather ? " At that minute there was a splatter of big raindrops against t west windows . " Me and my magic suspenders , " said Joe . " You should n't joke that way , Uncle Joe . " " Look who 's with us tonight , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was last known to smile in 1910 . " " I was n't even born then . " " Talk that way and no one will ever guess it . " Wanda had missionary nights and Scarlett O'Hara nights . S was reading Gone With the Wind , and she alternated evenings saving China with evenings of saving the South . In appearance was nearer the Chinese than Scarlett . I am judging , of course , Vivien Leigh in the movie  --  which had n't at that time even lxp252made . Wanda was stalwart and stocky . Her life was in her face and her dark eyes . She was built for stoop labor , close to the ground , with a waist so sturdy it would n't snap with bending ; not for stampinga high-arched foot on the veranda at Tara . Like all fifteen-yearolds ( and many of us later ) , she had more than one self , and she liked to give them all a try . Joe preferred Scarlett Wanda to Wanda the Chinese missionary . He heard enough preaching , his own and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , Scarlett Wanda could be shut up . Shutting up missionary Wanda , particularly if you had yourself brought her to that dedicated state , was less seemly . The rain itself , so longed for and needed , took Wanda away from both China and Tara . She went out onto the fake balcony of the raspberry stucco to let " the cleansing rain , " she said , " bounce off her tongue . " " I approve , " said Joe . " It 's a needed ritual . " Joe had another cup of coffee . How a man as constantly keyed up as he was could handle so much that was stimulating , I do n't know . Perhaps , I thought , nothing could hurt Joe . " Orpha , " Joe said , " I 've let you in for something tonight . " " Are they coming here or am I going there ? " " They 're coming here . I know it 's my night off . But the Griswoldsare in trouble and I told them I 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oversight meets tonight , and we 're in trouble , too . Nice trouble , but trouble  --  what 's the best use of the money we 're taking in ? All you have to do with the Griswolds is listen to them  --  and apologize for me . Do n't let Wanda preach them a sermon if you can help it . Tell them I 'll see them on Saturday , same time . " Joe left . Wanda went to bed with Gone With the Wind . I listened to the drumbeat of the rain ; no shower , but a real change-ofseasondownpour brought about by the veering of the moisture-laden winds . The Griswolds arrived when they said they would : 8:30 . They were a married couple in their thirties . Burt Griswold had a dark , seamed face and eyes that asked questions . At a time when few people were making money , he was . He owned auto-parts stores in Long Beach , San Diego , Bakersfield , and Sacramento . He bought old or wrecked cars , salvaged their usable parts , and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of replacementsto keep their old cars running . " My customers wish , " he said , " they had your husband 's power and could restore their machines by prayer . " " Joe is my brother , not my husband , " I said , " and he does not pray for cars . " " Why not ? I 'd miss my car a lot more  --  " " Burt , " said his wife , whose name was Marie , " let 's not talk about cars . That 's not what we 're here for . " " Sure , " said Burt . " You tell her what we 're here for . " " You can do it a lot better than I can . " I did n't know what their errand was . Had I known , my feeling about them would have been different . Marie Griswold was as blond as her husband was dark . She sat perfectly still , but in spite of the lack of any visible movement , a deep tremor registered on my internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from chattering . " It 's this way , Miss Chase  --  " " Mrs. Hesse . " " You 're married ? " " I was . " " California 's where you belong , in that case , " said Burt . " You wanted to see Joe ? " " Marie does . She wanted me to take her to Missouri . There 's a man there  --  " " A clinic , " Marie said . " That 's what he calls it . A man and his nurse , as far as I can find out . " " A doctor , " Marie said . " He calls himself an M.D. But he did n't get his degree from any sawbones college . Not that I hold that against him . He 's onto something the sawbones have n't discovered yet , and naturally they want to shoot him down . Marie heard about him from a friend and she said , What 's the point getting a part of myself amputated when there 's a man who can remove the source of the trouble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was before she heard about the Reverend Chase . " I did n't yet know what ailed Marie . She was the one who saw that I did n't know what they were talking about.  | " I have a lump in my breast , " Marie said , cupping her left breast gently . " Nothing but a little tiny lump the size of a walnut . But do you know what the doctor wanted to do ? Take off the entire breast . Not just the lump . " " And surgery frightens her , " Burt said . " So I set my foot down . No one 's going to mutilate Marie as long as I 'm around to protect her . She heard of this Missouri clinic where they put a poultice of some kind on the breast . Out comes the cancer like the core out of a boil . The breast heals and the woman is left the shape God made her . Before we could leave for Missouri , Marie heard of the ReverendChase , who just prays them away . A poultice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't you say so , Mrs. Hesse ? " It was n't my place to say anything , except " Joe will see you Saturdaynight . " I did n't like Burt Griswold . Where I had been brought up , men did n't talk about their wives ' breasts , except possibly to doctors . There was something casual , almost flippant , in the way Burt Griswoldspoke of his wife 's problem , oblivious to her tension and fear . " Well , what do you say , Mrs. Hesse ? " Burt repeated . " A prayer beats a poultice , do n't it ? " Burt Griswold , though asking for prayer , did n't seem very religious . " It depends upon what you 're praying for , I suppose . " " What does that mean ? " I was n't sure enough to answer . " My brother asked me to make his excuses for his not being here . He 'll see you Saturday at the same time . I should n't try to speak for him . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote about in my new notebooks , since , as it turned out , they had so much to do with Joe 's subsequent life . My thoughts about them , while unspoken , were not hidden , neither under a table nor deep in my mind . I talked with Joe about the Griswolds , and while I think he never opened my notebooks , he was free to do so  --  and knew it . It was midnight before Joe got home . He had been so taken up with the meeting of Ministry and Oversight that by now he hadp255forgotten his date with the Griswolds . I had something ready for him to eat . For the most part Joe ate little and did n't care what that little was . He did have a few preferences . He was crazy about tomatoes . If he had lived in the era of the Bloody Mary , he would have become addicted because of the tomato juice , not the gin . He liked tomatoes in any form , peeled , unpeeled , cooked , raw . On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish called " Escalloped Tomatoes . " It was hearty ; plenty of small pieces of home-baked bread , butter , and , of all things , sugar . With it Joe drank his usual black coffee . " How was Ministry and Oversight ? " I asked . " Out of their minds . They wanted to give me a raise in salary . " " I hope you let them . Wanda needs something besides my castoffs . I 'd like to buy some real strawberry jam for a change , not pink applesauce with alfalfa seeds . " " They raised me fifty dollars . " " Three hundred and fifty now ! " " I feel guilty . " " Do n't . You work eighteen hours a day . " " I 'd do it for nothing . " " You ca n't . You 're stuck with me and Wanda . My old bloomers hang down to Wanda 's ankles . Alfalfa seeds hurt my stomach . And wait until you hear about the Griswolds . They 'll add another two hours a day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Griswolds ? " Joe asked . " The people you had a date to meet tonight . " " Did they come ? " " They did . " " What did they want ? " " Mrs. Griswold would like to live a little longer . And she does n't want to be mutilated by surgery . " " Mutilated ? Who 's threatening to mutilate her ? " " In the Griswolds ' opinion , the doctor who will remove her breast in order to save her from dying of cancer . " " That 's not called ' mutilation . ' " " You talk to the Griswolds . Anyway , she had that all figured out till he heard of you . He was going to take his wife to Missouri , where they take out cancers with poultices . He asked me if I did n't think prayer beat poultices . " " What did you tell him ? "  | " Nothing . I told him you would see him Saturday night , same time . Would you pray for her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything hinges on God 's will . Jesus heals . But Jesus died suffering on the cross because it was God 's will . " When Joe began to talk of God 's will , he was talking theology , and I was not equipped to understand Joe on theology . He was a college graduate and a seminary student . All I knew of man 's relationship with God was " Be good . Do good . " And I had failed in both . I had been taught , as Joe had , that it was a Christian 's duty to learn the will of God . But never as Joe , a Quaker , had that God 's will was to be found not in rules and Bible verses , but in direct communication with Him . It might be God 's will for a man to suffer  --  and die . news to me . " How can you pray for healing with this belief in suffering ? " " I know God heals . I have faith . I also pray , Thy will be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about God 's will . What she cares about is her shape . " " God may , too , " Joes said . " After all , He made her . " Talk like that shocked me . I was a United Brethren , not a seminarianable to communicate with God . " Your God sounds like a man , " I said . This shocked me , too . I sounded as if Joe and I worshiped differentGods . " He was a man for about thirty years , you know . " I backed away from that subject . Joe was so close to God he could laugh and joke about religious subjects . I could n't . " I wish Mama and Papa were here to see your new Meeting House and hear you preach . " " They 're going to . That 's one of the reasons Wanda will have to put up with old bloomers for a while longer . I 'm saving the money for their fare . " They did n't get to California until the time of Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Joe began seeing the Griswolds . Talbot Ware was to he the life story of Josephp257Chase , with enough that was purely fictional included to preserve I thought , Joe 's privacy . I had noted in my novel-reading that whet a man of God , a priest or a minister , falls in love , his emotions ar of far more interest to the reader than are those of the unordainec This is particularly true when the lover is breaking his vows . Ther what in the story of a well driller or shoe clerk would be an amorou adventure becomes a struggle between good and evil . Talbot War had taken no vows of celibacy , except to himself . These he ha taken , however ; and when he fell in love , the reader 's interest woulc I thought , be heightened . Otherwise the story was to be a straightforward account that para leled Joe 's life , a young man sick unto death , healed by prayer , wh when cured became a preacher and what is known as a faith healerWhen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe , it had to be included . In it , in brief , were the justificatior of Joe 's ministry . And out of it , and the novel that included it , cam changes in my life and Wanda 's . And this is my life I am writin now , not Joe 's . Joe met with the Griswolds on Saturday at our place as he ha promised . I was never with Joe on such occasions . My presence , believed , would have been as out of place as a third person in a cm fessional . And such meetings with Joe were rather like a confession I imagined . The confessor did not say , " Father , I have sinned , " M. " Father , I hurt . " On Saturday evening , Wanda and I went to the movies . Movie were not thought of highly by either Quakers or United Brethret An occasional movie might be edifying as well as entertaining . we kept in mind that what we were seeing was'a made-up story , nc a shred of truth necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Captains Courageous . It was both entertaining and edifying , s no harm done in that line . But it was difficult to remember that was a story . It seemed truer than happenings Wanda and I rea ahortt every day itt the I.os Angeles Express . Wanda was at the age and of the temperament to become th heroine  --  or hero  --  of any play or movie she saw . She was Spence Tracy , the hero , himself , as we drove home from the show ; shp258did n't want any conversation that shattered this image of herself . So we came home without talking . Wanda went off to her bed with a nautical gait , forgetting her usual good night to Joe . " How did it go , Joe ? " I asked . " Fine . " " Did you talk to them about God 's will ? " " I did . They have great faith . " " Did you talk to them about poultices ? " " I think the word was mentioned . " " Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need it . Anything to go with it ? " " Raisin pie ? " After I gave him the pie and the coffee , I , too , went to bed : Orpha Hesse , widow , grass widow , alone in the world , I thought ; while Joe communes with God and Wanda rides the briny deep with her hero . The Griswolds were at Meeting every Sunday . Joe had evidently converted both . I avoided them , except to nod . I did n't believe the feelings Burt Griswold aroused in me were suitable for a meeting of Christians . That Joe did n't feel as I did was a small splinter between us . " Love your neighbor as yourself . " The first time I saw the Griswolds had been on a rainy October evening . It was raining again five months later when Marie came to call  --  on me , not Joe . There is a difference in California between an October rain and a March rain . In October , California has been waiting for rain and welcomes it the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never come ? " we say in October . In March , after a long rainy season , we ask , " Will it never stop ? " The dust has been laid , the tumbleweeds are sodden , dry arroyos are rumbling with water  --  who needs any more rain ? Marie , without phoning , came in the midst of a rain that had become as constant as air . She , a native of Iowa , unlike Californians , was wearing a raincoat . " Excuse me , " Marie said , " for dropping in this way . I was near here and I suddenly wanted to talk to you . Just you , not the ReverendJoe. "  | " I 'm alone , " I told her . " Joe is at church and Wanda is at school . I helped her off with her raincoat and hung it in the kitche where it could drip on the linoleum . When I came back to the livin room , I said , without thinking what meaning my words might hav for a woman who had cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , " she said . " My weight stays constant . People forget fror one time to the next how heavy I am . " Not trying to cover up my mistake , if I had made one , but tellin the truth , I said , " It 's the same with me . One month away fror friends and they all say , My , but you 've lost weight . ' And I haven lost a pound . The only way I can explain it is that I 've got a ft personality . They remember me fat and are surprised to see m svelte . " That made Marie laugh . " Do you think I have a fat personality ? " I do n't know you well to enough to say . " " I want to know you better . That 's why I 'm here . I 've got a lc to thank you for . " " Thank me ? " " Without what you said , Burt might not have been willing to se your brother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the one to thank . " " Oh , he is . He is . He has changed all of our lives , mine especiall ' When I came here , all I wanted was to be well again . I never one thought or cared about God 's will for me . Now that 's what I ca about most . And my caring about that has made my whole fami happier . " I watched Marie as she sat in the old Dudley rocker , remindir me of that poor golden-haired child of twenty-five years ago who s : naked in another rocker saying , " She would n't let him do it . " Thy poor girl had never heard that God 's will might include sufferinThe rain continued . Marie rocked very gently . " I am thinner she said . " You were right . " " I could be mistaken . " " No , no . You saw right . Could I talk to you privately ? " " We are private . We 're the only ones in the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean " Of course . Women have troubles of all kinds it 's none of a marbusiness to know anything about . "  --  This is Joe 's business .  --  " Well , you should talk to Ioc  --  , then . "  | " I ca n't . I ca n't even talk to you about it unless I have your word you wo n't tell Joe . " " If it 's Joe 's business , it 's my duty to tell Joe , is n't it ? " " If you think so , I wo n't say anything . " Either way Joe was not going to know anything about it . " Who will it help , then , for me to know ? " " Me , me , " Marie cried . She got out of her rocker , came and sat on the hassock by my side . She put her hands on my lap and looked up into my face . " Who else can I talk to ? My mother is in Iowa . " I was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I might even be younger than she . She put her head in my lap , and I could no more resist patting her dry brittley hair than I could deny a cat a caress . " If you have to tell Joe , I can keep quiet . I thought you might be able to listen and not tell . " " I can listen . And not tell . " " I am going to die . " It was news to me and not news . I could feel death in the texture of her hair and the tightness and color of the skin over her cheekbones . What was there to say ? " I am sorry . " " Perhaps you are mistaken . " " You are going to your reward . " I said nothing . I stroked . Marie stood . " It 's not my imagination . " " Why do n't you tell Joe ? He 's not vain . He does n't heal . He knows that not everyone he prays for gets well . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suffering is God 's will for some . It 's God 's will for me , and I accept it . And I 'm not going to ask Joe to suffer with me . " " Have an operation . It may not be too late . Joe believes in operations . " " I do n't want to . I am perfectly happy . If it 's God 's will that I suffer , I 'm willing . " " You must be suffering now . Does n't Burt notice ? " " I have pain pills . " " Joe 'll have to know , sooner or later . " " But you are n't going to tell him ? " " No . I promised you . " " And I 'm not going to . " " But Joe . . . " You promised . " " I 'll keep my promise . I do n't understand why , though . "  | " If you were closer to your brother and God , you would . It 's nc just Joe  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch n dying , what would it do to his faith in the power of his prayers : " Nothing . His faith does n't need to be bolstered up by a lie " You promised me . " I kept my promise . I did n't tell Joe about Marie 's concern f ( him , her fervent wish not to shake his faith or cause him pain . Ni could I reveal her confidences about Burt , startled as I was by son of them . These were her secrets with God , and I , as confidant , cou give her the gift of comfort if silence was included . I prayed th she would find mercy , and I forgetfulness . Joe certainly never knew that Marie was dying . But Griswold mi certainly have known . The funeral was at the Meeting House at the service was the one Joe had established some time before . differed from the conventional in two main ways . The casket with the dead body was not at the front of the church as is usual , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menth Marie Griswold in his sermon . Instead , he dwelt on the beliefs th had sustained her and should sustain us all . Joe 's funeral practice which emphasized not the dead body but the truths by which t man or woman had lived , became known as the Ceremony of Li It was used when Joe himself died . His body lay at the back of t Meeting House . No words of Joe 's were voiced ; only the eterr truths of his master Jesus Christ . Marie 's father and mother , Mr. and Mrs. Sam Shields , of Muss tine , Iowa , had come west for their daughter 's funeral . They d not sit with their son-in-law . They took no comfort , it seemed me , in a funeral service in which their daughter 's name was ne ' mentioned and her body was placed out of the sight of those w had gathered to mourn her . I cried . So did Wanda . I did n't see tears on the faces of anyo else . Mr. and Mrs. Shields sat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe 's congregation , true believers , did not feel that it becat Christians who worshiped God to mourn the departure of one their brethren to live forever with God and His Son . I , though , could have mounted that pulpit and said a few wotp262about Marie Shields Griswold . I did not do so , of course . Nor did I , unless I am doing so now , put this into any book of Unspoken Thoughts . " Take notice , you mourners , " I would have said , " of the bravery of a girl whose name was Shields and who offered up her body as a shield to protect those she loved . She protected her husband . She might have lived had she been willing to save her life by submitting to knives that would change the body her husband desired . " She loved her minister and she believed with him that it is sometimesGod 's will that we suffer . So she suffered , rather than bring Reverend Chase news she thought might disturb his ministry . " Marie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she was mistaken in what she did . She was n't mistaken in being willing to suffer for love . That is the sermon she preached  --  with her poor body . Let us all listen . " I did n't say a word of this . All I did was cry . When the funeral service was concluded , I went to Mr. and Mrs. Shields . They were strangers in the community , and someone , I thought , should tell them that Marie was loved and would be missed . I was n't permitted to do so . When I held out my hand and said , " I am the Reverend Joseph Chase 's sister , " they looked at my hand as if wondering how any one of the Chase family could have so human-appearing an appendage . That one look was all I got . Or that anyone else got . The Shieldses left the Meeting House very quickly , not even pausing to touch the box that held the body of their daughter . I could n't get the Shieldses ' stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the continent to say farewell to their only daughter , and at the funeral , which would , they thought , provide them with their last and only chance to do so , they had not even been permitted to see her face . The daughter , so dear to them , had not been eulogized , her favorite hymns had not been sung , her courage had not been mentioned . They , accustomed to more orthodoxburial services , had every right to feel that the man who had failed to cure their daughter had also slighted her in her death.  |p263I  loved Marie . Not only for herself but because of the regard sh had for Joe . I believed that she would want me to go to her parent to explain to them as best I could Joe 's belief in the healing pow ( of Jesus and , if I could , comfort them . The Shieldses were staying at Marie 's home . I went there the da after the funeral . Mrs. Shields , still grim and red-eyed , met me at th door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in . " I was Marie 's friend , " I said . " I would like to talk to you abot her . I admired her very much . " " Come in , " said Mrs. Shields , without any hospitality in her von or friendliness in her face . The room I entered reminded me of Marie . It was the room of woman who loved her home and who , with time on her hands as sh was dying , had labored to embellish it . Tidies had been crochete for the chair backs , velveteen covers quilted for the hassocks . NoN adays , when we admire the bare and the spare , Marie 's living roc ) would look very fussy to us . Marie , heading , and she knew it , for t1 eternally bare and spare , had wanted to leave behind for Burt coziness that would remind him of her . Before I had a chance to tell Mrs. Shields that I felt her daughter presence in the room , Mr. Shields , with Burt on his heels , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the woman doing here ? " he asked . " She 's the preacher 's sister , Sam , " Mrs. Shields said , as if her hu band did n't know it . " I know who she is . But do n't call that man a preacher . I ' 1 known too many good reverends to call that shyster a preacher . Tf preachers I knew preached the gospel and let the doctors practic medicine . " " Shyster , " I repeated , shocked . " Get her out of here , " Sam commanded his wife . " I told you nc to let either of those two or any of the people they 've hoodwink ( in here . The least I can do for my dead daughter is not hobnc with those responsible for her death . " Mrs. Shields said , " Sam , Marie would n't like to hear you talkir this way . Whatever caused her death , she died a Christian . An Christians forgive . " Burt , who had listened in silence , broke in before Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to accept the fact that Marp264was the one that came to the Reverend , not the other way around . She had this deathly fear of the surgeon 's knife . She 'd try anything before she 'd submit to that . " " I 'm not blaming you , Burt , any more than I 'm blaming Marie . You let her do what she was determined to do . But you did n't tell her  --  the way this so-called Reverend did  --  that you could cure her with a little prayer and laying on of hands . " " Joe never laid on hands , " I said . " Maybe he should have . What 's it matter ? My girl 's dead . " " Sam , " said Mrs. Shields , " Jesus Christ healed His believers . " This made Sam tense with rage . " Martha , do n't belittle our Saviour by mentioning Him in the same breath with one of these publicity-seeking , money-grubbing , Bible-thumping so-called faith healers . They are covering the country like locusts . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pay for it , if it 's my last act on earth . The Reverend claims the Lord tells him what to do . Well , the Lord 's told me that it 's my duty to see that Chase pays for Marie 's death before he sends other people to their graves by keeping them from seeing a doctor . You tell the Reverend that , miss . " " Mrs. , " I said . " Tell the Reverend , Mrs. , " said Sam . I did n't . There was no point telling Joe that somebody 's relative blamed him because a person he had prayed for had n't recovered . He knew that had happened before and would keep on happening . And it would never in this world stop him from believing that Jesus could heal , or keep him from praying that Jesus would . When a Mr. Eldon McRae called one morning asking if he could come out that afternoon to chat with me , I said yes . Many people , timid about talking directly with Joe , asked to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving upward to Joe . Mr. McRae had a pleasant voice . He was , he said , in the District Attorney 's office , and there were matters he hoped I could give him some information about . Because of Joe , I had talked with all kinds of people : reporters , the sick , relatives of the sick , alcoholics , the newly saved . A man from the D.A . ' s office , though I was n't very surep265of a D.A . ' s function , let alone the function of one of his assistants was pretty sure to be a normal county official of some sort . And this Mr. McRae was . Wanda was at school . Joe was preaching at a Quarterly Meetin in Kern County . When I opened the front door , I saw a man why looked a good deal like my father , plumper , balder , and bette dressed . No one could have been more polite . He complimented me on m house , said we needed rain , asked me if I liked Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask , thong I did n't realize it at the time . " Were you a friend of Marie Griswold 's ? " " More an acquaintance , though I certainly liked her . " " How long did you know her ? " " About six or seven months , I guess . " " How did you come to make her acquaintance ? Was she a men ber of your brother 's congregation ? " Not at first . " " What came first ? " " Marie , Mrs. Griswold , and her husband , Burt , had a date to tal to Joe . Joe had to be away so they talked to me instead . " " What did they talk about ? " It was at this point that it struck me that this was no ordinal conversation . Here was a man , an official of some sort , interested i only one subject : the Griswolds . And he was interested in the Gri wolds not because of me , I was sure , but because of Joe . I began t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered all c his questions honestly , but with less freedom than I had had whe I had thought that our only purpose was in talking about a woma we had both liked . " We talked about Marie 's health . " " Was n't this a rather unusual subject for people who had nevf met before ? " " How do you mean , unusual ? " " Well , we 've just met . Would n't you be surprised if I started tel ing you about some ailment of mine ? " " I would n't if Joe had been the person you wanted to see in tl first place . " " So that 's how it was . " " Of course . Marie was sick . She had heard that Joe could hep266the sick by prayer . Joe would n't like to hear me say that . He prayed , Jesus healed . " " But you said they did n't live in Los Angeles . " " People have heard about Joe in distant places . He 's had letters from New Zealand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your brother because of Marie 's sickness . " " Yes . " " And she died in spite of his prayers . " " She knew she might . " " How do you know that ? " " Joe does n't promise healing to anyone . I know that . Besides , Marie knew she was n't getting better . " " How do you know that ? " " She told me . " " Why did n't she go to a doctor then ? If prayer was n't helping . " " She wanted to show her faith . " " In your brother ? " " In Jesus and in my brother as His disciple . " " And she was willing to die for her faith ? " " I ca n't answer for a dead woman . She had faith and she did die . I was a friend just a few months . Talk to people who knew her better . Her parents . They 're still here in town . Her husband . " " I have , Mrs. Hesse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been complaints come to our office and we 've had to look into the matter . " I did n't understand what he called the " matter . " Joe 's praying ? Marie 's dying ? I did n't want to know . I did n't want to be mixed up with killing or dying . What Lon had done had been enough to last me for a lifetime . And ignorant though I was of the law and of district attorneys and their duties , I did n't need to be told that Eldon McRae , the District Attorney 's man , was saying in a roundaboutway , or trying to get me to say , that except for coming to Joe instead of going to a doctor , Marie might still be alive . Joe got home from the Quarterly Meeting in Kern County late , but I had waited up for him . I had hot coffee and warm gingerbreadwith lemon sauce ready for him . He 'd eaten in Bakersfield , but that was four hours ago , and he had preached . And Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already in bed.  |p267Feed  the inner man at Quarterly Meeting . Feed the flesh here " Boy , does that smell good , " he said . I let Joe have a cup of coffee and his first piece of gingerbrea* before I told him about Eldon McRae 's call . Joe was as calm as i I 'd told him that Mama had dropped in for a visit . " Do n't you care that these things are being said about you ? " " I care that McRae came here and got you wrought up . There ' no way under heaven I can do the work I 've been called to do am not be criticized . I accept that . It 's part of the yoke I put on . " " It makes me mad . This man sounded as if he had some officia right to make you account for what you do . " " He has . And if you 're going to get mad , you 'd better save you temper for what 's to come . " " More questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Fred Benson . " " I thought Fred was your friend ? " " He is . But Fred 's got his job to do , the same as I have . And he ' * better do it good , right now , because he 's up for election . " " What is Fred 's job ? " " Orpha , sometimes I think you do n't live in this world . As Dig trict Attorney , Fred 's job is to bring lawbreakers to justice . " " I have n't broken any law . " Joe laughed . He had a big laugh . It came out of the same void box that permitted him , before loudspeakers had been invented , t ( make himself heard by a thousand people . No one would have thought , hearing that laugh , that Joe was a man who had just beet told that the District Attorney 's office was interested in him . Or wh ( knew far more about that interest than I did . Before he could tel me about that , Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . When she saw the gingerbread , she said , " Mama , I'n hungry " ; as if it was hunger that had awakened her . " You take after your uncle Joe , do n't you , pet ? " said Joe . " Everyone says so . " Joe laughed again . " Gingerbread for two , Orpha . One milk , one coffee . " " Coming up , " said I.While they were eating , I went out onto the porch . The Septem ber air said exactly what McRae had said : " We need rain . " I was n't an overpoweringly hot night , as September nights can bi in I , os Angeles . But it had been a warm day and no breeze hatp268come inland off the ocean to cool and refresh us . A first-quarter moon had gone down , and the stars were bright as little brush fires . It was a waiting season , summer past , but what would make this a fact was yet to come . Joe and Wanda had finished their gingerbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ought to hold you from hunger 's pangs for another hour or two . " " Uncle Joe , " Wanda said , " I want to say my good-night prayers . " " Did n't you say them when you went to bed ? " " Of course . But I feel like praying again . " " That 's fine . You run right upstairs and pray . " " I want you to hear me , Uncle Joe . " " God 's the One to hear you . You run right upstairs and talk to Him . I want to talk to your mother . " Wanda knew better than to argue with Joe , especially on the subject of prayer , on which he , not she , was the authority . When she left , Joe said , " Fred 's coming out to see me . " " Officially ? " " Friendly , too , I hope . It 's called preliminary investigation ' ; nothing formal . He 's had a lot of complaints . Not that he has n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me . " " When did preaching become illegal ? " " It is n't the preaching . It 's the healing . " " And the dying . " " And the dying . How did you know ? " " I went to see Marie 's folks . Her father hates you . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Would it have done any good ? " " No , it would n't . You did the right thing , Orpha . " " He 's the one that 's got Fred to come out to see you . " " Fred 's a friend of mine . " " He 's a lawyer , is n't he ? " Joe , as if he had n't a trouble in the world , laughed that big loving laugh again . " Orpha , you 're still a backwoods girl , are n't you ? " He put his arm around me and walked me through the door I had n't closed out onto the front porch . This was unusual in Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we had been , perhapsp269I would n't have been so swept off my feet by the touch of Lon an ( Tom . Perhaps I would n't have been such a cat lover or so eager to hold Wanda in my arms if I had found affectionate touch as girl in my family . I do n't know . Perhaps the same need drove Jo to God . Out on the porch Joe threw up his arms to the sky . " Oh , Orpha do we have eyes because there are stars to see ? Or did the stars shining down on blind faces , breed eyes ? " " You talk like that to the District Attorney , Joe , and he 'll sent you to an insane asylum , not a jail . " " Not Fred . He knows I 'm crazy but harmless . " Joe did n't , like Wanda , want an audience to hear him pray . Hi stepped away from me , clasped his hands , lifted his head , and prayec silently . I did the same . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming lesson and Camp Fire Girls meeting to fin ( Fred Benson and Joe in the living room . Both were drinking ice ( coffee . The heat still held . I was inclined to get as far away fron that conversation as possible . I did n't want to hear more of San Shields 's hatred of Joe . Joe , for whatever reason , wanted me to stay , chiefly , I think , s ( that I would see that Fred Benson was n't an ogre . He was n't . HE was physically a cross between the village blacksmith and Abrahan Lincoln . Heavier set than Abraham , sharper featured than the blacksmith ; but with some of the force  --  and humanity , too  --  w ( associate with both men . " Fred , this is my sister , Orpha . She keeps house for me . " " Glad to meet you , Orpha . I 've known your brother for somi time . " " Always for bad reasons , " Joe said . " No , no . My wife goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't joined yet , but I hear plenty of good from her . If everybod ' was like Iva , there 'd he no reason to call a grand jury . " " Sam Shields is n't everybody . " " Now , Orpha . " " Let her alone , Joe . Do you want a sister who does n't can whether you 're called up before a grand jury or not ? You 're right Orpha . Sam Shields is n't everybody . But that old farmer has gop270just about everybody aroused . There 've been complaints before , but nothing substantial when looked into . Doctors , who do n't want anybodycured of anything except by a man with an M.D. after his name . Old-line church people , who think the church is stepping out of line if it pays attention to anything but its members ' souls . There was even a wife who wanted Joe banned from preaching and praying because her husband , after a couple of sessions with Joe , stopped being an invalid , began wearing the pants again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 've been all kinds . You would n't believe the number of people who object to something as seemingly intended for good as asking the Lord for help . And Shields has them all roused up now , what with that son-in-law of his able to substantiate some of Sam 's claims . " I 've looked into and dismissed complaints before . I ca n't do that with this . This will have to go before a grand jury . They 're the ones who will decide about the complaint that Shields has sworn out . " " Decide what ? " I asked . " Whether to indict Joe , to bind him over for trial . " " Trial for what ? " " Well , I can tell you , Orpha , what Shields hopes . He hopes the grand jury will say , This man should go on trial for manslaughter . ' " That word awakened even the calm Joe . " Manslaughter ! " Joe went out onto the porch with Fred Benson . I stayed inside . I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had to say . When Joe came back in , he said , " Do n't look so downcast , Orpha . Grand juries fail to indict more often than they indict . " " What does that mean ? " " It means they say , There 's no reason to try this man . ' " " You think that will happen ? " " I do . " It did n't . Grand-jury members are required by law not to divulge what goes on in their meetings . Before Joe 's encounter with such a group , I took for granted that men and women investigating the possibility of a crime would n't break any law themselves . I know a lot more about the law and lawyers now than I did then . I would n't say now that the first thing a few jurors are bound to do is to leak a few facts to wife or boyfriend . I would now say that it 's done . When someone  --  a juror , possibly , although she never hinted about whop271she was  --  phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise I 'd be a partner in lawbreaking . I did n't hang up . I listened . What I heard was that every man who had an axe to grind against Joe was there grinding it . There was n't a doubt in the world but that the jury would indict and that Joe would be brought to trial for manslaughter . " Get your brother a lawyer and get him quick , " the lady lawbreakertold me . " He 's going to need one . " I did n't tell Joe about the phone call . I did ask him what would happen if the grand jury indicted him . " I 'd be tried . " " Like Aaron Burr , " said Wanda , who rather relished the idea that history was being enacted in her own home . " Wanda , the dishes are still on the table . " The idea of a trial fascinated Wanda and the dishes went to the kitchen almost as slowly as if under their own power . " Tried . For causing Marie Griswold 's death . Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . I prayed for her healing . " " I know that . But if there is a trial , you 'll need a lawyer to say that 's what you did . " " There wo n't be a trial . If there is , I can say so myself . " " Me , too , " said Wanda , carrying plates one at a time to the kitchen . " I 'll bear witness for you , Uncle Joe . " " At the rate you 're going , " Joe said , " you wo n't even be there . You 'll still be clearing the table . " If the wind had n't been blowing , perhaps I would n't have gone . No , that is n't true . I would n't have gone so soon is more accurate . It was a Thursday or Friday morning , near the end of the week , anyway . I awakened to noise . The casement windows , opened because of the heat , were creaking back and forth on the rods that held them open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing was a Santa Ana , that great blast of hot air that the desert exhales over the irrigated valleys to let them know who 's master . Most people hated the Santa Ana . It dried their skin , frizzledp272their hair , and rasped their nerves . A wind , they thought , should be cooling , even cold . There was something evil about a hot , sandladenwind . I loved it . Maybe I 'm torpid ; maybe I need a wind to lean against  --  or to contend with . I reasoned , if reasoning is what was involved , that static air able to move with the force of a Santa Ana puts motionless people to shame . I would not be motionless . I had worried night and day since the call from the grand-jury woman . There was no use imploring Joe to do what my caller had urged : get a lawyer . Hiring a lawyer was , in Joe 's eyes , an admission of guilt . If you were n't guilty , your acts would speak for you . If guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court into letting you off as easy as possible . Also , Quakers who did n't believe in fighting did n't believe in legal fighting , either . Accused and accuser should meet and settle their differences like Christian brothers . The sight of Sam Shields 's face had convinced me that whatever he was , he did n't consider Joe a Christian , let alone a brother . I knew that the mind behind Burt Griswold 's hard eyes would care nothing for truth . Joe needed a lawyer ; and if he had one , I would have to get him . The choice was n't hard . I knew only one lawyer : Ralph Navarro , who was the counselor for the Mexican boys ' club Joe had over to dinner now and then . Joe and Ralph were good friends . Joe told Ralph , who was a Catholic , that Catholic saints , communicating directly with God without the help of any priestly intermediary , were on their way to becoming good Quakers . This made Ralph , who was an easy laugher for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They agreed , too , that a priest did n't have time , with a wife and children , for looking after his flock . Ralph was , I judged , far from a priest ; with a wife and child dead with Joe 's disease , the two were especially able to understand each other . On that dry , hot , windy morning , as soon as Joe was off to his office and Wanda to school , I called Ralph Navarro . I knew well enough that Ralph Navarro was one of the best-known lawyers in Los Angeles ; I had heard Joe say , even though he had refused to listen to me , that " if I was ever faced with the gallows , Ralph Navarrois the man I 'd want by my side . " Ralph 's secretary answered the phone . I did n't know then that a busy lawyer 's days are parceled out , hours , even minutes at a time , for months ahead.  |p273I  was told that Mr. Navarro was in conference . " I must speak u him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is calling , please ? " " I am calling for the Reverend Joseph Chase . " The next voice I heard was Ralph 's . " Orpha ? " " Yes , Mr. Navarro . Joe 's in trouble . " " I 've heard about it . Can you meet me for lunch ? Are you down town now ? " " I am . " " Do you know where the Biltmore is ? " " Of course . Right across from Pershing Square . " " Meet me in the lobby at 12:30 . Can you do that ? " " Of course I can . " I did n't know it then , but Ralph had walked out on a luncheon of importance to talk to me about Joe . I told him what I 'd heard from my anonymous phone caller . He asked me to repeat the con versation verbatim . No , he said , there was n't enough there to move to set aside an indictment . Besides , he had heard more . I told him what Mr. Shields had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shields is a vindictive man , but Griswold is the most dangerous witness . " " Ca n't you go there and stop them from saying these things ? You know they are n't true . " " Orpha , the only persons permitted in a grand-jury room are the District Attorney , the witnesses , and the jurors . " " Is there any way you could be a witness ? " " Not a chance . Do n't worry . If this matter comes to trial , I 'll have my say . Fred 's been a pretty honest D.A . He 's up for election now and will be pushing hard . But we 've locked horns before , and I have n't lost yet . I do n't expect to this time . " " You 're saying you 'll be Joe 's lawyer ? " " That 's what I 'm saying . " " Beginning this minute ? " " No use jumping the gun . They have n't indicted yet . But the minutethey do , you let me know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a man at the house to arrest Joe . " " Arrest ? Like a criminal ? " " Like a man accused and indicted . Unless lie 's tried and con/victed , he 's no criminal . You let me know and we 'll see he is n't treated like one . " I drove home slowly . Santa Anas often die down in the afternoon , then gust again at night . There was no letup in the heat . I thought that I had done the right thing . Joe asked no questions . Wanda was full of school happenings . Perhaps it was my imagination . Both looked at me , I thought , as if they knew I was hiding something from them . The phone lady was right : Joe was indicted for manslaughter . Ralph was right : an officer came to the house to take Joe before a magistrate , where he would be charged with manslaughter . I , right or wrong , had called Ralph the minute I heard the news of the indictment and the nature of the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallows , proved the truth of what he had declared earlier , that Ralph was the man he 'd want by his side in time of trouble . Ralph , as his lawyer , was by his side when he was arraigned . And Ralph was the man who saw to it that Joe was released on his own recognizance . I ca n't remember all the legal footwork that preceded the trial , the choice of jurors , number of witnesses called , and like matters . I do n't have to remember . I have access to a verbatim report of every word said at that trial and could put it all down here if I wanted to . I do n't want to . This is my life story , not Joe 's , not Fred Benson 's , not Ralph 's , not Wanda 's . Certainly I was a part of the trial . I spoke in it . Certainly I was body and soul with Joe in what could put an end to the life he valued most  --  not on the gallows , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a candle to Joe 's . But his life has been told , more than once . I 'm the only one who 's going to tell of my life . Joe will have to play second fiddle here and he 'd be the first to urge me to tell it that way . While we waited for the trial , Wanda started her junior year in high school . Joe carried on his ministry as usual . I had my book to work on . When I started Talbot Ware , I had intended , as I'vep275said , to tell the story of a hell-raising young man , sick unto death cured by faith , who became himself a minister and faith healer , I certainly had no idea that he would ever be tried for homicide . I knew , since this was Joe 's story ( except for the fictional romance , which I inserted in the first version and later removed ) , that the trial , no matter what its outcome , not only was a part of Joe 's life , but also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to tell a story , whether with pen on paper or with tongue at the supper table , is the knowledge that listeners ' or readers ' attention must be caught in the wonderment of " How is it all going to come out ? " I was glad to have the story , trial or no trial , to work on . It did not keep me from worrying about the outcome , but it kept me busy . As a writer , I should have tried to talk with the Shieldses and Burt Griswold . Several notebooks of Unspoken Thoughts did n't make Montebello , California ( or even me ) , regard me as a writer . There I was , the sister of the indicted minister ; any running around with pencil and pen getting statements from Joe 's accusers would not have been suitable . Maybe not even possible . It is unlikely that persons who thought Joe guilty as accused would want to say anything to his sister . It was suitable for me to talk with Joe 's lawyer . Ralph knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , jury trials . By chance , he had been one of Aimee 's lawyers when she stood trial after her pretended abduction . Ralph had been born in Mexico . Some long-ago Spanish hidalgo had left an imprint sterner and more commanding on his countenancethan that on the round-faced , smiling Indian-Mexicans who were pouring across the Mexican border into California . Ralph did n't underestimate either Fred Benson 's ability or Sam Shields 's determination . " I would never have taken this case if I had thought for a minute Joe was capable of the crime they 're accusing him of . Or that Burt was n't . " " Do you really think Burt wanted his wife to die ? " " What do you think Marie was trying to tell you in that last con-versation ? " I do n't know whether Ralph 's ability to see into the nature andp276motives of people had come to him through his long experience with the law or was something he had been born with . A combinationof both , I am now inclined to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? " I repeated . " I do . " " Did he believe that Joe would be willing to let her die for twenty thousand dollars ? " " He did n't think Joe would . That 's why he gave it to the church , not Joe . That way , Burt would look like a church-loving man . And any doubts Joe had would be put to sleep . " " Doubts about what ? " " Burt 's motives . " " Joe never supposed he had any motives except to have his wife healed . " " You did , though . " " I never thought he wanted Marie to die . The most I thought was that he wanted to find a way for her to be healed without being  --  disfigured . " " Losing her breast . " " Yes . " " If your brother had n't told Mrs. Griswold that it was God 's will for some of us to suffer , his case would be much simpler . " " We all suffer . It must be God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to put an end to suffering . " " Joe does n't claim that . He tells everyone Jesus does the healing . " " O.K. , O.K. But in one breath he tells that poor woman Jesus will heal her . And in the next , he tells her that it is God 's will that some of us should suffer . What is this unhappy woman , in love with the man who is talking to her  --  " " In love with Joe ? " " Do n't think you 're the only woman who can fall in love . " " But Marie was married to Burt . " " I ca n't think of a better reason for falling in love with Joe . So here is holy Joe , never suspecting Burt 's motives . And here is lovelornMarie determined to accept , without complaining , God 's will for her to suffer without accusing the preacher she loves of failing to cure her . " " Do you really think that is the way it was ? " " Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't started digging yet . And convincing a jury may be another story entirely . It wouldp277be easier if your brother was n't a Quaker . Those people set themselvesup to be so almighty pure and above reproach , it does the ordinary sinner good to see one take a fall . " " You kept Aimee out of jail . " " Aimee was never in danger of jail . Any high-school debater could 've kept Aimee out of jail . All she was accused of was a few nights in Carmel with a boyfriend . That was a nice human thing to do . She should n't have messed it up with that story of a desert abduction . " " Joe would never do a thing like that . " " Worse luck for him  --  and Marie . If he 'd spend a week in Hawaii now and then and less time preaching what does n't make sense  --  a combination of faith healing and suffering through God 's will  --  Marie might be alive . And Joe certainly would n't be standing trial . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some rules . Quakers want to play it by ear  --  and God does n't whisper the same message in every Quaker ear . " " Is this the message God whispered in your ear ? " Ralph Navarro clapped his brown hands together . " By God , I think you 're on the way to becoming a Jesuit . And if you are , you would n't tell anyone what God said . "  |p281Ral|ph  Navarro was right about the woman he was talking to then He could not be expected to see the woman she was to become : ; writer . I think he would now have the insight to understand tha telling others what God whispers to them is a writer 's obsession often a puny God , whispering into a tin ear .

At the time of Joe 's trial , I had the simple task , I thought , c telling the life story of Joseph Chase . His life as a boy had bee fascinating to me , daring and tough , tender and sympathetic . Hi sickness , cure , and conversion were a mystery I wanted to explorfI was well into the story of Joe 's life in the month before the triz started ; which was also the month when Mama and Papa arrive ( Members of the Meeting came out to our house every evening i that month to pray , to plan , to meditate . I was lucky to have solitar work to which I could in all conscience retire . I was happy to see Mama and Papa . My parents looked as the always had to me : elderly . Papa , like a statesman-farmer . Mama , 1ik a schoolmarm who had strayed into the kitchen en route to a right for-women platform . Parents and teachers , who look old to th young from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . The young , in ten years , change unbelievably for parents an teachers . Joe , who had left home a thin , pinch-faced young invalid , w ; now a man , a sinewy brown California preacher who talked to thoi sands on First I ) ay ; and had conversations with God he was n't has lid about reporting . 1 could see my parents trying to envision i their minds the changes , year by year , that had transformed harmp282scarum Joe Chase to the Reverend Joseph Chase , and thus make him more recognizably their son . They would n't have changed him in any way . They rejoiced in his health , admired the graying of his black curls , marveled at the power of his ministerial oratory . This Joe Chase was a fine man . Was he at one time their farm-boy son ? He was as strange to them . as Cinderella had been to her mother and sisters at the ball . They talked to him a lot about the past . They remembered the same animals , storms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were somewhat embarrassed by the almost loose way Joe had of talking of God and Jesus . Joe would n't , it appeared , have turned a hair to see Them there or to hear Them speak . Mama was taken aback by Joe . " I count myself a religious person , " Mama told me , " and I 'm not going to fault anyone , least of all my son , for putting religious talk into his everyday conversation . " " Joe does n't count himself a religious person , " I told Mama . " What ! " she exclaimed . I hurried on to explain the difference in Joe 's mind between being religious and being spiritual . " Religions are man-made , Joe says . What is spiritual is the result of the indwellingspirit of God . It has nothing to do with churches , or creeds , or ceremonies . " " Is that what the Quakers believe ? " " That 's what they believe here in Southern California . " " That church , east or west , never did rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joe . And he 's studied religions a lot more than you and I have . " " I grant Quakerism 's better than nothing , " Mama said doubtfully . Wanda , even more than Joe , had changed in my parents ' eyes . While older , Joe had not gone from boyhood to manhood since last they had seen him . Wanda , when last they saw her , was a child , a chunky , good-sized , outspoken child , it is true . Now she was a sexy young lady . They did n't remember what a few years will do to a nine-year-old  --  in any climate . They attributed the change to the tropical California sun and to our nearness to Hollywood . They did n't approve , or at least Mama did n't , either of Joe 's familiarity with God or of Wanda 's breasts , so outthrust even the most modest male eyes could n't miss them . There was nothing self-consciously sexy about Wanda . She was still Kickapoo-shaped , sturdy ratherp283than curvy , the baby fat gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could n't count Wanda 's ribs , or her eyelashes , either ; too many lashes and the ribs too well covered . She was big-eyed , big-breasted , big-hearted . I loved her . There was no one , not even Joe , I could talk to so easily . ( " Who does she look like ? " I was sometimes asked . " Her father , " I would answer , and no one had the nerve to ask , " Which husband ? " ) " You 'd better watch that girl with Joe , " Mama told me . Mama could have been present in the Garden when the Serpent put the apple in Eve 's hand ; and while Mama did have other thoughts , none bulked as large in her mind as sex and the way unprincipledwomen often used it . " Mama , Joe is as pledged to celibacy as any priest . " " It 's a pledge a good many priests fail to keep . " " Wanda 's my daughter . " " She 's got Matthews blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front porch with Papa while we listened to the passing cars and the distant thud of an oil pump . " This is a far cry from Amesville , " he said . " Do you like California ? " " I ca n't see California for thinking about Joe . How did the boy ever get himself into such a mess ? " " By praying , I reckon . " " This is no time for joking , Orpha . " " I 'm far from joking . That 's the one and only reason he 's being tried . He prayed that Marie Griswold be cured of her cancer . She was n't cured . She died . Joe is really being prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license . " " It wo n't end that way . " " I do n't understand you . " " Joe is accused of manslaughter . Half the parents in the world would be in jail if praying for their children 's health was called ' doctoring without a license . ' They are n't because no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe was n't paid twenty thousand to pray . He never saw the money . "  | " He should have . And it should 've made him suspicious . Just because Roosevelt is passing government money around like water do n't mean a seller of used-car parts got hold of twenty thousand in any legal way . Joe 's still a socialist , I suppose ? Share and share alike ? Well , he and Roosevelt likely see eye to eye . But it 'll take F. D. R. himself to get him out of this jam . And I doubt that prayer is Franklin 's long suit . " Papa hated Roosevelt almost more than he loved Joey  --  but not quite . Papa was a good old Republican farmer and he tended to believe that every setback , personal or national , stemmed from Rooseveltpolicies . It was Roosevelt and socialism that had caused Joey to be so careless about the sources of the money his church received . " Oh , Orphy , " he said , and there were tears in his eyes , " where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what he meant about me . The two marriages . But Joe ? " Joe 's a fine man , " I said . " He had the will to get well and the brains to get educated and the heart to find God . And you and Mama should be proud of him every minute . He does heal people . I 've seen them . He cured my headaches . " " Ah , well , " said Papa , his cheek still streaked with tears . " That pain was all in your head . " Papa was no jokester . This attempt to be funny while his heart ached touched me , so I went to him and clasped him  --  something I had been too timid to do when young . " It 'll turn out all right . You wait and see . God wo n't desert His own . " " His only begotten Son got crucified . " I stood back from Papa to look at his face . There were no tears now , only a sternness I did n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had Papa been losing Him ? It was nearer Halloween than Thanksgiving , nearer jack-o ' - lanterns than pumpkin pies . In spite of this , Wanda and I made a supper to celebrate the folks ' arrival as near a Thanksgiving feast as we could . By Thanksgiving Joe might be in jail . We might not all be together again for a long time . Papa and Mama had dropped Joe off at the Meeting House ; then , in his car they had gone on to explore Hollywood and Beverly Hills . There were street maps telling tourists where the stars lived.  |p285California  traffic alarmed my father , but he was a good driver , steadfastand not easily buffaloed . I had at first planned a traditional California dinner  --  Mexican food : tamale pie , guacamole , refried beans , flan . Fortunately , I gave it up . Later , when I did make a tamale pie , it was not relished . I prepared , instead , the food all of us had grown up with : chicken and dressing , two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pie , pumpkin and mince . They were all late getting home for dinner . Joe had been meeting with Ralph Navarro and his Ministry and Oversight board . No one else in that group had a Thanksgiving dinner awaiting them . So they took their time . Papa and Mama were sure they had seen Errol Flynn watering his front lawn . Despite the delay , the food had not been harmed . Joe had never been more loving , never more confident . He asked Papa to return thanks when we sat down to the table . " If I did it , Pa , we might never get to the food . " Even so , Joe added a postscript to Papa 's prayer . " Thank Thee , dear Lord , for Thy everlasting love and for bringing five people who love each other together . May we never forget that we live in the bounty of Thy gift of life and that we are Thy children and brothers of Thy son , Jesus Christ . Amen . " I had put all the food on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberance of his feeling , served , scooping out mounds of potatoes and inquiring , " Dark meat or white ? " like a devoted butler . When not carrying food , he was son , brother , and uncle , hugging and kissing . " You do n't know how I 've longed for this day . " " I once had visions of you being a lawyer , Joseph , " Mama said . " It never crossed my mind you 'd need one . " " It crossed mine , " Papa said . " God has sent me the best . " This kind of talk grated on Mama 's ears . Not that she did n't believe that God had His finger in every pie . Obvious facts did n't need much talking about . If she heard Papa declaring , " My wife is the light of my life and the ornament of my hearth , " she 'd start looking for the other woman . It did n't occur to me then  --  it does now  --  that the five of us seated at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a native child of the Golden West among us . A woman , twice married , husbands departed , and hopeful now of finding herself  --  not a husband . A Midwestern couple , Roosevelt-hating , God-fearing , churchgoing , Republican-voting : the real backbone of Southern California . Girl , born out of wedlock ( bastard in the sociology textbooks ) ; pure product of California sunshine ( beach or desert ) , California poppies and Hollywood , beholding eyes would affirm . Joe , most typical Californian of all , a man come to the state ( the one-lung state ) in his youth for his health . Product of the great Californiaschool system , and possessing that talent more admired in California than anywhere else : a talent for public performance . Joe 's talent was for preaching the gospel , a gospel somewhat esoteric . Why would Californians who divorce , make sexy movies , build tract houses , kill each other by speeding on their freeways , produce and drink wine , take to a man preaching conversion , faith healing , and the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most . Uprooted , far from home , divorced , lonesome , doing what they had been taught as young people was wrong , they long to be loved and forgiven . Perhaps they found it was easier to follow a man who looked like a young Ronald Colman and preached like a holy Clarence Darrow than some bland plump-jowled chicken-fed pulpiteer . Joe , whether because of his long sickness or his youthful skirmishes with girls , looked like a man who had sinned , suffered , and repented ; and for those reasons could supposedly understand the plight of others who had trod that same painful path . " Joe , " Mama said , " you have n't had a word to say about the meetingof your lawyer and the church members . What went on ? What was their opinion ? Did they reach any conclusions ? " " They did , " said Joe . " But let 's not talk about it . This is homecomingday . There 'll be plenty of time to talk about the trial later . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They try criminals . Some Thanksgiving ! " Wanda said , and began to cry . To muffle her sobs , she wrapped her big napkin , which had belonged to Lon 's mother , about her head . Some Thanksgiving was right . Only Papa and Joe ate any pie . Wanda , her napkin still wrapped around her head , went to her room to cry.  | " Orpha , " said Mama , " you 're going to have to watch that girl . " " I 'll talk to Wanda later , " Joe told me . " I do n't know what you can say . " The three of us sat for a long time , silent . Mama , without a word , began to clear the table . Once she was in the kitchen , Joe said , " Do n't think that I do n't take that woman 's death to heart . " " A preacher takes risks he ca n't foresee , " Papa said , trying to ease Joe 's pain . " I ca n't stop preaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . " I left Joe and Papa at the table and went to Wanda 's room . Usually , following an outburst of that kind , Wanda , like someone who has had too much to drink , went sound asleep . She did have on her nightgown , but she was on top of the covers , propped up against the bed 's headboard . " You made quite a fuss , Wanda . Do you think Joe 's done something wrong ? " " Maybe . " " Do you think Uncle Joe took money from a man in return for trying to make sure the wife died ? " " Of course not . He could n't do that . I did n't mean that . Only , how can Uncle Joe believe that God wants people to suffer ? Or think that God speaks to him ? I am going to stop being a Christian . I think Uncle Joe 's dangerous . Some people could say what he says and no one would pay any attention . But whatever Uncle Joe says , you believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to doubt him . " Wanda weighed almost as much as I did , but she still sat on my lap . " I think it 's too hard to be a Christian , Mama . I 'll try to be good and sensible , but I 'm not going to get carried away again by anyone who says he hears the voice of God . " Wanda reminded me of myself , after Lon 's death . I , too , was going to be good and sensible . Not get carried away . Be ruled by my head , not my heart . That rational girl married Jake Hesse . Joe 's raspberry-colored stucco house of uncurtained arches , one bathroom , and three bedrooms was not big enough for five people . I gave my room to Papa and Mama while they were there , and sleptp288with Wanda . I had lost the ability to sleep with anyone  --  or with anyone as warm and spread-eagled as Wanda . At the end of a week my parents found a two-room-and-kitchenette apartment on what was still called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located there . I had expected my mother , accustomed to a large farmhouse and the duties of feeding chickens , gathering and selling eggs , making buttter , to be bored and unhappy in two boxlikerooms not far from the heart of a sprawling city . Instead , she loved it . We are attached to the homes we have and the occupations that keep us employed , not because we love them , but because we are n't bold enough to experiment with any other . We are too adaptable for our own good . We are farmers and teachers and writers by chance , not choice . Mama had been a housewife because she had married a farmer-nurseryman ; the wife of such a man kept house . In her two-room apartment , which she could keep spotless with one hour 's work a day , and with a city library only three blocks distant , Mama 's career as a housewife was over . She read . She brought home books on subjects she had never heard of before . She attended night classes , learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddha and Confucius . In short , she became a Californian  --  and a Southern Californian , who , as a person more recently uprooted than his northern brethren , hunts replacements more avidly . The Depression was not yet over , but for people who had been as thrifty as the Chases , it was a blessing . Their days of moneymaking were finished , but what they had saved went far : more carrots for a dime than they could eat in a week ; round steak , twenty-five cents a pound . And at a cafeteria , with which Los Angeles was well populated , they had good meals and the pleasure of " eating out " for thirty-five cents . A library is not the solace for an outdoor man it is for an indoor woman . Griffith Park was in the city but far from urban . Tramping there , Papa met a man who was beating the Depression  --  or at least coping with it  --  by raising rabbits . People who could not afford beef could still afford rabbits , and the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur . Rabbit-raising was not permitted within Los Angeles city limits . This man lived out east of Montebello . Papa accepted the invitation to visit with a double purpose  --  to inspect rabbit-raising and to drop in on his children . The outcome of the inspection was that Papa became a partner of the rabbit raiser , a man with the unlikely name of Tennessee Overturff . In this partnership , Papa made an even more unusual discovery than had Mama . She had become a housekeeper through marriage . Papa had been a farmer-nurseryman by choice , not marriage . Now he discovered that he preferred working with animals to working with plants . Ask any cattleman whether he would rather ride cattle or seed the harvest grain . A rabbit is not a cow and a hutch is not a corral . The same difference is there , however . Do n't ask me how either is able to kill , let alone chomp down with his teeth , on animalsthey have nurtured . So there we were : five Southern Californians . Mother , attending night classes and studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits . Daughter , trying to become a writer . Granddaughter , trying to become an unbeliever . Son , California 's , possibly the nation 's , best-known evangelist and faith healer , facing the accusation of having caused a young woman 's death by persuadingher to rely on prayer instead of medical treatment . Did California cause any of this ? No , though it does seem to draw to it people with unusual inclinations . With Papa and Mama out of the house , Wanda in school , Joe busier than ever before , I wrote six hours a day . Papa , whose rabbit operation was located in what was then called " the Whittier Narrows , " often stopped in to see me on his way home to his Normal Hill apartment . What I wanted to do , with both Mama and Joe absent , was to prod Papa into talking about the young Joe , the Joe I had been too young to assess or evaluate . November , in the old days before smog in California and before the rainy season had really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown , poinsettias beginning to bloom , and geraniums still as red as in July . On such an evening , Papa stopped in with a dressed rabbit ( as far as the rabbit is concerned , this means undressed  --  no fur , no head , no guts , no feet ) in a paper bag . I cooked the poor creatures hep290brought to me ; they were tastier than chicken , but I kept them out of the sight of Pussy 's offspring ; to a cat ( even to me ) , they looked like skinned cats . Papa and I stood on the front porch admiring the sunset . The clouds had opened up on the western horizon as if melted by sun heat ; the sun itself appeared visibly afire . Through the cloud opening , Catalina was a gray hump on the water like some basking Pacific sea monster . " Nothing like this to be seen in Amesville , " Papa said . Papa had made a California discovery : Congoin . Congoin was the name given for some reason to mate by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauchos . " Congoin , people said , accounted for the endurance and virility of the South American cowboys . A pot of Congoin , a twist of dried meat , and the gaucho could ride all day without hunger or fatigue . Congoin had no caffeine in it , and hence did not interfere with sleep . Joe scorned it . Sleep was nothing he cared about . Papa and I , sleepers , by choice , drank either Congoin or sassafras tea in the evening . Mama had brought me a big aromatic bag of sassafras bark when she came west . It was Congoin that evening for Papa and me . We sat facing each other in the breakfast nook , our cups of pale-green gaucho tea on the table . " I wish you 'd tell me more about Joe when he was a little boy . " Papa , who knew the reason for my question , was n't eager to answer it . " Fools ' faces are seen in public places , " he said . " I 'm not enthusiastic about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little I could do that would make Joe any more public than he was at that minute . I did n't remind Papa of this . " Joe wo n't be called Joe in this story . It 's the story of a man named Talbot Ware . Things happen to him that never happened to Joe  --  or to anybody else as far as I know . Joe 'll be disguised com-pletely . " " Is the trial going into your book ? " The trial was two weeks away . " Yes , " I said . " No point your trying to disguise anything or anybody after the trial . How many preachers in the United States have ever been tried on charges of this kind ? " " Readers will think I read about the Chase case and livened upp291my story a little by attributing some of what happened in it to Talbot Ware . " Papa was not a snorter , nor a harrumpher . He did make a sound of disbelief deep in his throat . " I 'll miss my guess if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Chase disguised as Talbot Ware . ' " " The trial is n't what I want to talk about , Papa . And who knows what will happen in it , anyway ? It 's Joe as a little boy . You knew him before I did . Did you ever think he 'd be a preacher ? " " Joe , a preacher ? He was scallywag . You know that . " " Lots of scallywags have been converted and become preachers . Was there anything about Joe when he was little that made you think he would be a preacher someday ? " " Well , he was a great talker . And he could charm a bird out of a tree . Those two do n't add up to the ministry . Though they 're no drawback . What I thought he 'd be was a politician . Joe was no great hand at plowing or milking the cows . He went to church because he had to . " " What caused the change ? " " Blessed if I know . What changed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good schoolmarm to , first , the wife of a crazy man , then the wife of a fussbudget shoe salesman . " " You never said a word to me against either one . " " They were O.K. as far as any dealings I had with them . As for living with either one  --  no , no . " " They were the ones that asked me . " Papa reached across the table and took my hand . " Orpha , I think you always underrated yourself and I think I know the reason why . " I had never kissed or been kissed by Papa ; never had my hand held , my shoulder patted  --  or , for that matter , my bottom spanked . We had hardly ever touched . I had felt less guilty committing adultery with Tom than I did holding hands with my father . If Jake had found Tom and me in bed together , I would have been sorry about being caught , but I would n't have felt dirty or abnormal , as I would had Mama come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nook holding hands with my father . Papa recognized my uneasiness . He squeezed my hand and let go of it.  | " I do n't worry about Joe . His path is settled . You 're the one who 's drifting . No husband , no children . " " Wanda 's my child . " " That girl 'll be married before you can say boo . " " Wanda does n't even keep steady company with anyone , let alone talk about marriage . " " She 's your child in that . She wo n't waste time on courtship . She 'll up and marry the way you did . No , I do n't worry about Wanda or Joe . It 's you , buried here like some old priest 's half-nun housekeeper . " " I like keeping house for Joe . " " That 's a job for some widow of sixty , not for a girl of thirty . " " I have n't been a girl of thirty for some time , Papa . You know that . " " You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live , Orpha . And you 're a better-looking girl now than you were when you were kicking piepans twenty years ago . Try to remember that . " Wanda 's school bus dropped her off before Papa left . Milk was her drink , not sassafras tea or Congoin . She joined us at the table . " Grandpa , are you saved ? " " I 've always thought so . " " Can you hear God talking to you ? " " No . " " How do you know what to do then ? " " I read the Bible and pray . " " Do you think Joe hears God ? " " I do . " " It would be better if he did n't , would n't it ? " " Easier for him , maybe . Not better . " " I would n't want to hear God speak to me . " " Feeling the way you do , Wanda , I do n't think you have to worry . " When Papa left , I went out onto the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few somber clouds , rust-colored at their edges . Catalina had disappeared . The usual evening breeze off the ocean was blowing inland . " We live in a good land , " Papa said . " Misfortune brought us here , but the land itself is a blessing . "  |p293I  did n't want my father to think that I had drawn away from his touch . I put my arms around him as if we were parting forever . " Good-bye , Papa . I 'll remember what you said about piepans . " When I went inside , Wanda had taken the rabbit out of its sack . She was holding it by its hind legs , like a doctor with a newborn babe . " Do you want to eat this ? " she asked . " Not very much . " " I 'd like to bury it . I do n't think I 'll ever eat meat again . " " Wanda , I do n't think I can keep up with your resolves . Are you still working on not being a Christian ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read the Bible and pray . But I 'm not going to hear voices or tell people they have to suffer . I do n't want to eat this poor little animal . I 'd like to bury it as an offering . " " Cook it and you 'll have a burnt offering . " " I 'll do it for you and Uncle Joe . I 'd like to bury its bones afterwardwith a marker for me . " " What do you plan to put on the marker ? " " God is love . " " What do we give Joe for supper ? " " Tomato gravy , creamed peas , biscuits , hot gingerbread with lemon sauce . I 'll cook the rabbit , but I wo n't eat it . " " Bury it uncooked if you want to . " Wanda kissed me . " It has suffered enough . " Wanda was in the kitchen cooking when Joe came home . " What 's that you 're drinking ? Pa 's virility tea ? " " Congoin . " " Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not coffee ? " " Virility tea . " " Has it been a bad day ? " " Not especially . " " Here 's your Congoin . Are you giving up coffee ? " " Never . But whatever there is in this that gives gauchos their endurance , I thought I could use tonight . Give Pa my thanks . " " Ile was here on the way home . With a rabbit . "  | " Good . A little meat would n't hurt me , either . " " Wanda has buried it . " " Buried it ! What was wrong with it ? " " Not a thing . Except it was dead . Wanda 's gone back to being a Christian again . Not your kind . Papa 's kind . She wanted to mark the occasion with a sacrifice of some kind . " " Who was to be the sacrifice ? Me ? I do n't get any supper ? " " Oh , yes , you do . Tomato gravy and biscuits . You would n't have wanted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful sight . Wanda feels like she 's saved its life by not cooking it . It 's buried with a marker , God is love . ' " Joe finished his second cup . " Do you ever wish you 'd never taken on the raising of that girl ? " " Never . I have doubts about everything else . Not her . Joe , I tried to get Papa to talk about you when you were little . The whole idea of a book about you upsets him . If he had his way , there would n't be a biography or autobiography in the world . He thinks it 's boastful , talking about yourself or your family . He thinks what you do should speak for itself . " " It 's going to  --  loud and clear  --  in a month or so . " " He thinks that should n't ever be mentioned . " " If you write about me , it 'll have to be . But I ca n't say I 'm crazy about playing Johnson to your Boswell , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Johnson today ? " " I bet that does n't cut much ice with Johnson today . " " I bet it does with Boswell . Joe , I thought when I was asking Papa about you , why not ask Joe himself . " " What did you ask him ? " " If he ever thought you 'd be a preacher . " " What did he say ? " " He said no . He said you were a young scallywag . " " I ca n't deny that . But , inside me , I was hunting for something . Scallywagging was just busywork . I did n't know what I was hunting for . I did know I had an amount of love and praise in me that chasing girls did n't take care of . Someplace at the center of the world was a radiance . I wanted to be there . I wanted to be a part of that shining . " " When you were a little boy ? " " What 's little ? " " Twelve or thirteen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . " " You went to church every Sunday . " " Church ? What 's church ? An organization . A ceremony . A religion . I wanted an indwelling Christ . I wanted something I had never heard of . How did I find Him ? Sickness . Suffering . God 's will . A follower of a man of God . A healing . " Joe was n't telling me what I needed to know any more than Papa had . What did he do when he was scallywagging ? What did he do when he was hunting for the radiance ? Wanda came in to set the table for supper . " Uncle Joe , " she said , " I 'm going to be an old-time Christian like Grandpa . " " That 's the way I started , " Joe told her . " They wo n't put her on the stand , will they ? " I asked Joe when Wanda went back to the kitchen . " Surely not . She never even talked with Marie . Marie herself 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the credit when people get well , do you ? Well , do n't take the blame when they die . "
