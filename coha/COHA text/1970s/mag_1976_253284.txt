After years of doing battle in separate though similar technological arenas , the two titans of the U.S. photography market finally meet in the same ring this week . Eastman Kodak Co. , which fathered the snapshot almost a century ago , will show off to the press its new line of instant-picture cameras , thus offering Polaroid Corp . its first serious competition* since Edwin Land brought out the Polaroid Land Camera nearly three decades ago and ushered in the instant-photography era . <P> The contest between giant Kodak ( 1975 sales : $5 billion ) and smaller , but well-entrenched Polaroid ( ' 75 sales : $812.7 million ) , both with large marketing organizations and big ad budgets , promises to turn into one of the flashiest tussles ever . Polaroid chose Oscar night last month to introduce its Pronto instant-picture camera before a television audience of millions ; it backed up that campaign with an advertising blitz in national magazines . Kodak has the same eye for glamour . Capitalizing on the Bicentennial , it will begin national marketing of its new cameras on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <P> Hidden Children . As is usually the case when it is on the verge of unveiling a new product , Kodak is supersecretive about its cameras . The company 's 1975 annual report has two photos of playing children taken by the new process , but the pictures are half-hidden and show only good color reproduction and a rectangular shape ( Polaroid 's SX-70 system produces square images ) . <P> From sources inside and outside the company , this description emerges : Kodak will introduce at least two cameras , one priced at about $40 , the other possibly ranging up to $180 , v. Polaroid 's range on its SX-70-type models of from $66 to $179 . Both cameras will , like the SX-70 , eject a card that in a few minutes turns into a color photo before the viewer 's eyes . <P> Kodak 's is a dry-to-the-touch , litter-free process , unlike earlier " wet " Polaroid systems that produced sticky prints after sensitized paper was peeled off and discarded . The cheaper Kodak model will probably use a thumb-operated lever to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power the more costly version , but it will be installed in the camera , not in the film pack , as is the case with the SX-70 system . This will increase film shelf life and avoid all the problems Polaroid had with its early SX-70 film packs , whose batteries were sometimes dead when they were sold to customers . <P> Easily Duplicated . Perhaps the most important difference is that Kodak 's process will probably produce high-quality prints that can be easily duplicated through most corner drugstores . Copies of SX-70 prints can be made , but originals must be mailed to the company for reproduction , a process that takes about a week or longer . <P> Almost from the moment Land came out with his camera in 1947 , there has been speculation that Kodak would sooner or later follow through . Many analysts were convinced the time had come in 1963 . Instead , Kodak then brought out its Instamatic line , in the belief that a sizable market still existed for simple , cheap , easily loaded cameras . It was right ; film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
