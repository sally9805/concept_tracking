Now that the holiday season is over , what should be done with old Christmas trees ? Henry L. Diamond , New York State 's commissioner of environmental conservation , last week warned that burning them causes air pollution and burying them whole wastes scarce landfill areas . As a better ecological idea , Diamond singled out the system used in Greenburgh , N.Y . The town is picking up the trees at curbside and running them through chipping machines , used the rest of the year to clean up after tree prunings on the town 's property . The tiny chips can then be used as a compact landfill or as a mulch to prevent the spread of weeds in gardens . <P> One of the great changes in the American consciousness , in Frederick Jackson Turner 's 1893 thesis , came when the frontier closed . A shift of equal importance , believes Professor James J. Flink of the University of California at Irvine , involves the automobile . Said he at last week 's meeting of the American Historical Association in Manhattan : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for most Americans , automobility has become simply utilitarian and lost its quasi-religious connotations ; most important , the automobile and the automobile industry no longer call the tune and set the tempo of American life . " One major reason for this shift in attitudes , Flink thinks , is young Americans ' sweeping indictment of the car for contributing to " environmental pollution , urban sprawl , the decay of the center city , the decimation of our remaining wilderness areas . " He did not predict what will take the auto 's place as a predominant American force . <P> <P> Under the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act , no industry or city can dump pollutants into navigable waterways unless it gets a " discharge permit " from the Federal Government . In late 1970 this old law became the keystone of President Nixon 's program to clean up U.S. waterways . Last summer some 20,000 applications for permits were sent to Washington for approval . <P> Last week a federal court in Washington threw the whole permit program into confusion by ruling that discharges into non-navigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the 1969 Environmental Policy Act , the Federal Government could not issue a permit to any polluter without first studying the environmental impact of each decision . <P> If the ruling is upheld on appeal , the paperwork ahead presents a herculean task . Likely result : fast action by Congress on either Senator Edmund Muskie 's or President Nixon 's bill , both of which would aim at stopping pollution from cities and factories at its source ( before it ever reaches any waterways ) and give them a ten-to-15 year deadline to comply . Anyway , something must be done . The requirement just set by the federal court has made the present laws virtually unworkable , since no federal agency can possibly provide a complete environmental report on the effects of discharges from every factory everywhere that asks for a permit .
