tonight that we will soon reach agreement on all the issues and bring this long and difficult war to an end . " To put it charitably , he was wrong . The two sides are far from agreement , and Mr. Nixon has resumed massive bombing and shelling . For a decade , President s and their spokesme n have sworn that none were more devoted to peace than they , that only the bullheaded ness of " the enemy " has kept us fighting . Bullheade d about what ? About freeing their country from what they consider a foreign-do minated , corrupt regime in Saigon ; bullheade d about restoring the unity of Vietnam , as anticipate d in the Geneva Accords of 1954 . These bullheaded Vietnames e say they are Marxists ; they get aid and comfort from Moscow and Peking ; and so their cause has been deemed inimical to American interests and ideals . Three President s have been determine d to thwart them at whatever cost . In dollars , the cost to date is $65 billion ; in lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " civilians " ; in human misery and sickness of soul ? it is incalculable . Put alongside that price the fact that after 10 years " the enemy " commands most of the countryside in the South , Moves its troops and weapons back and forth with relative ease , and keeps its economy functioning in the North , bombing or no bombing . What is extraordinary in all this is the faith of the White House that vital American interests are at stake . If that faith had not been so ' unshakable , Mr. Nixon would long ago have turned away from war . And indeed he more than once led us to think that was his intention . Was he not first elected on the assurance he had a plan for peace ? The question was always what he would be willing to pay for peace . In our opinion , the price was never exorbitant : all that was demanded was the decision to get out , the communication of that decision to Hanoi , with the understanding that American prisoners would be promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and is exorbitant , for it may require abandoning Vietnam to the ... Vietnamese . It was too high because the Vietnamese who might ultimately prevail in our absence are in league with the Other Side . Mr. Nixon , following the example of Lyndon Johnson , therefore made his moves on the theory that " the enemy " could only be brought to his senses by repeated blows on the head , and that when he was bloody enough he would bow ; negotiations would then pose no problem . But the theory is demonstrably false : " the enemy " does not bow , nor does Mr. Nixon stop beating him over the head . For the cause of peace , Nixon will be amiable to infidels in Moscow and Peking , but not in Hanoi , for Hanoi is not a Great Power . At least he will not be amiable unless and until Hanoi is victorious , and then ideology may be displaced by more practical considerations . Henry Kissinger 's attempt on December 16 to account for the scuttling of the draft accord that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmise that Mr. Kissinger broke the bad news for fear that too many Americans would begin to suspect that the puppet was manipulating the puppeteer , and that Thieu was the one who blocked an agreement . That impression , humiliating to the White House , had to be corrected . Whereupon Mr. Kissinger , harboring God knows what private anguish , was dispatched to meet the press and explain why a settlement that was " at hand " in October was no longer at hand , why those few loose ends that could be tied in several days were not tied , why the talks had become a " charade . " One thing had to be made clear : not Saigon but Hanoi was the villain of the piece , and the President would not stand for it . Hanoi subsequently claimed the US had demanded 126 changes in the October draft accord . As we interpret Mr. Kissinger 's remarks , what Mr. Nixon would not stand for are the key points in the compromise that had been reached in Paris ; he would not give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Vietnam policy from the start . These objectives , rather vaguely referred to by Mr. Kissinger are : a halt to the civil war by the North and the Vietcong ; acceptance of the partition of Vietnam ( for a while ) ; recognition by the revolutionaries of the legitimacy of the Thieu regime , and therefore of the impossibility of any interim coalition administration in the South . These were Lyndon Johnson 's objectives . As long as they are overriding , the door to disengagement is shut tight . And when Mr. Kissinger refers to these aims as " modest requirements relatively easily achievable , " it is he who is playing charades : If they had been easily achievable , the war would be over . xperience , " said Oscar Wilde , " is the name everyone gives to their mistakes . " But what further experience in Indochina is needed to convince the White House that it ca n't have its rice cake and eat it , too . Charades is the name of the Vietnam game Mr. Nixon is playing with the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want in Indochina , since the superpowers share a larger " global interest " in peace . Turning that expectation on its head , how eager would Washington be to help extricate Moscow or Peking from similar folly ? " Charade " describes Mr. Kissinger 's assertion that we are at odds with Hanoi because of " linguistic difficulties " ; or his notion that after years of guerrilla war a band of international monitors can keep the two sides at arm 's length ; or his statement that " the interplay between Saigon and Hanoi is one of the complicating features of this negotiation . " Complicating feature ? That " interplay " is the whole thing ! What we 've been waiting to find out is whether at long last the President is prepared to disengage from the " interplay . " Now we know : we will not disengage , because " we can not accept the proposition that North Vietnam has a right of constant intervention in the South . " Translated , that means we hold to the belief that our military power can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign in Saigon , and can keep Vietnam divided long enough to save face for whoever is in the White House . How many times have we been told that the President is determined no one shall " impose " a government on the South ? Another charade . Like his predecessor , Mr. Nixon cares little whether a government in Saigon is " imposed " or not ; he will not tolerate a government 's being imposed by the Vietnamese whom we 've been fighting . Thus , when Mr. Kissinger says that " we can not make a settlement which brings peace to North Vietnam and maintains the war in South Vietnam , " he means that we will leave the war only if the revolutionaries stop being revolutionaries . Writing in these pages on July 16 , 1966 , some months before his death in Indochina , Bernard Fall foresaw the outcome of this policy : " The Vietnam war is now likely to ride the upswing of the blood-drenched roller-coaster into the annihilation of industries , flood control and irrigation dams , and cities and villages ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will supply the Vietcong and the infiltrated divisions with the help of massive coolie labor , people must become a strategic target . And they will . Never fear , they will . " They have . More American fliers will be captured , some newspapers will howl , angry Americans will demonstrate and petition . But no protests will force the President to reverse course unless there is a resurgence of sanity and conscience elsewhere within the government . Let us be specific . The reputations of Henry Kissinger and Secretary-designate of Defense Elliot Richardson rest on something weightier than high office ; they are thought to be men of intelligence and rectitude . How much do they value that reputation ? The peace-making efforts of Kissinger have been shot down ; Mr. Richardson , isolated in the Pentagon as any POW in North Vietnam , will be obliged to take responsibility for the bombing . They know that the political landscape is littered with blasted reputations of honorable men who stayed on in government , hoping to do good , but who ended by giving sanction to a ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Moynihan ? Is a bombs-away administration one he can honestly serve as ambassador ? We desperately need leaders ; the " good soldiers " have done no good . The majority leader , Mr. Mansfield , could lead , if he were to use his considerable parliamentary power cannily and boldly . Then there are the senators of the President 's own party ? Brooke , Case , Javits , Percy , Aiken , Hatfield , Mathias , Saxbe , Scott , Packwood . If they were to break free and join like-minded Democrats , a durable coalition for disengagement could take hold in the Senate and prevail . There were tough-minded Democrats like Fulbright , Morse , Gruening , McCarthy , McGovern , Church who defied their chief when he was in the White House . Principle does on occasion take precedence over partisanship . An aroused bipartisan majority in Congress can stop this madness . It can do it by delaying confirmation of the President 's nominees , postponing consideration of his legislation , and refusing to vote one more dime for the war . Crowded Courts /Fr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is a myth , " Justice Douglas took occasion to remark in a dissenting opinion a couple of weeks ago . The justices , he said , contradicting the other eight , dispose of " vast leisure time .... We are vastly underworked . " In a report released on December 19 , a seven-man committee of lawyers appointed a year ago by Chief Justice Burger reached an opposite conclusion that is certain to provoke furious controversy . If the Supreme Court is underworked , it is probably the only court in the country of which that can be said . For the fact of choked dockets and of a judicial process that staggers under the demands made of it is hardly denied by any informed observer , including Justice Douglas , who pointed in the same dissent to the 15-month backlog of civil cases in the US court of appeals on the West Coast . The backlog of criminal cases in metropolitan trial courts throughout the country is scandalous , as is the fatal impediment that such a backlog constitutes to the effective employment of the criminal sanction as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law and order problem is as real as anywhere ! Perhaps the reason why the committee appointed by Chief Justice Burger reached a conclusion different from Justice Douglas ' is to be found in the committee 's conception of the Court 's function . " The task of decision , " says the committee 's report , " must clearly be a process , not an event , a process at the opposite pole from the ' processing ' of cases in a high-speed , high-volume enterprise . The indispensable condition for the discharge of the Court 's responsibility is adequate time and ease of mind for research , reflection and consultation in reaching a judgment , for critical review by colleagues when a draft opinion is prepared , and for clarification and revision in light of all that has gone before . " There can be no dispute over the statistics of the Court 's workload . About three times as many cases were filed in the Supreme Court in 1971-72 as in 1951-52 . Over the past 35 years , the number of cases has grown fourfold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court does not hear arguments and write opinions in all these cases . And so long as each justice must make an individual decision before a collegial one is reached , increasing the number of justices would only make the task more difficult , not easier . What the Court does is to decline to make any decision in the vast majority of the cases offered , which come to it in the form of petitions for review . It picks those it deems important and hears and decides them . As the chief justice 's committee , headed by Professor Paul A. Freund of Harvard Law School noted , the Court could , no doubt , find ways to preside over the administration of its docket ; that is to say , it could delegate parts of the decision-making process to staff , as other executives do . The idea has been , however , that each justice passes on each case and decides which are important and deserve to be heard . With a docket of 4000 cases , this task is crushing and cuts heavily into the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion described by the Freund committee . The committee recommends , therefore , that a new national court of appeals , staffed on a rotating basis by judges of the existing circuit courts of appeal , be created to help the Supreme Court screen the mass of petitions for review . The choice is between having the justices relieved of the burden of independent , individual decision on each of 4000 petitions for review internally , invisibly and in publicly irresponsible fashion by junior staff , or having part of the task , which now exceeds the capacities of the justices , taken over under their supervision and authority by a new and publicly responsible institution . The Freund committee makes a number of other recommendations , more technical in nature and narrower in scope , for aiding the Court . Hopefully its report will point the way for studies of the judicial process in lower courts , state and federal , civil and criminal . For a generation , substantive law reform has striven , and for the most part beneficially , to enlarge rights and to secure them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as has sheer population growth itself . But the machinery , if that is what it should be called , either creaks to the point of breakdown , or , taking the term " machinery " seriously , transforms itself into a " high-speed , high-volume enterprise . " Either way , it mocks the idea of justice . Down the Drain One month ago President Nixon cut a $6 billion chunk out of the best anti-pollution bill ever to pass Congress . The reason he had was the one given five weeks earlier when he tried to kill the bill : he must " protect the working men and women of America against tax increases and renewed inflation . " When he vetoed the legislation just before midnight on October 17 , he called it " staggering " and " budget-wrecking " because it authorized the government to spend up to $24.7 billion retroactively and in future years to build water treatment plants in every part of the country . There may have been an element of spite in this . The President 's decision was announced the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request . Congress overrode the anti-pollution veto by a lopsided margin ( 52-12 in the Senate and 247-23 in the House ) , only to have the President retaliate in late November with a decision to " impound " $6 billion of the authorized money : more than half of what was to be given to states for building new treatment plants . It 's difficult to judge how the President 's decision will affect state planning . Officials who could speak up , wo n't , Perhaps they 're being cautious nut to anger the men who control what remains of the federal antipollution purse . But because the federal layout has been halved , 32 states will not be able to sustain the level of water purification they had planned . Some states have considered filing suit against the government ( or illegal seizure of funds , but so far only the city of New York and a private citizen in Illinois have done so . Senator Edmund Muskie ( D , Me. ) , who chairs the Senate water pollution subcommittee , has said that " we JCongress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any litigation . . . . " But again , there has been no clear response from Capitol Hill . What is clear is that President Nixon ignored the advice of his chief environmental aide , William Ruckelshaus , both before and after the anti-pollution bill was passed . As administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , Ruckelshaus sent a long memo to the White - louse in October when he and others believed the water pollution bill was about to be vetoed . After analyzing its strengths and weaknesses in detail , Ruckelshaus spoke for the EPA : " We strongly recommend that the bill be signed by the President , " He quoted from three major presidential environment speeches , saying the new money should be spent to " support the commitment of the President in his State of the Union message of January 22 , 1970 , to ' put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in America where they are needed and to make our waters clean again , and to do it now . ' " Ruckelshaus concluded that " It seems reasonable to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Product over the next several years to assure for future generations the very survival of the Gross National Product . " Perhaps not how we would express it , but the sentiment is right . Ruckelshaus drafted the " needs " estimate on which Congress based money authorization . It 's unusual for the press to be given internal communications between the White House and its agencies , but in this case the memos were in print even while the issue was hot , Ruckelshaus ' endorsement of the bill was printed in the Cougresional Record the same day Nixon vetoed it , and Nixon 's private request to Ruckelshaus asking that he withhold the St ' billion in funds was released with EPA 's announcement of the cut , November 2S , Nixon later asked Ruckelshaus to cooperate in " my attempt to maintain a strong and growing economy without inflation " ? in other words , to defend the Executive seizure of funds . So the EPA administrator must now embrace a contradictory policy : he must punish states that fail to meet high water quality standards , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build treatment plants . The Two Texans Apair of - 1- exans have been elevated to the top jobs in the two political parties . Robert S. Strauss for the Democrats and George H. Bush for the Republicans are alike in other ways . Both have friends in the oil-drenched business community . Both are better than either their sponsors or theft past associations would indicate . listen to Strauss ' flashes of wit , his soft drawl and sweet reasonableness , his attempts to accommodate his intraparty foes , is to forget momentarily that his college roommate was John Connally and that his chief sponsor for the national chairman 's post was Alexander Barkan , the director of the AFE-CIO 's Committee for Political Education ( COPE ) . Strauss is adept at the mini-filibuster , and by the time he 's finished reporters have forgotten what their question was , let alone the tact that he did n't quite answer it . Strauss was elected by a coalition of Southern and border state members led by their governors and including the remnant of die-hard segregationists on the Democratic National Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connecticut ) , labor 's men ( Frank King of Ohio , Mike Johnston of Pennsylvania ) and a healthy sprinkling from the Rocky Mountain and Western states . It is more or less the coalition that ran the Democratic Party during the ' 50s , except that this year it had a bare majority On the national committee instead of the overwhelming control it exercised before the committee was expanded and liberals made breakthroughs in Virginia , Tennessee , Mississippi , texas and most of New England . After he was elected : Strauss referred to himself as " a centrist , a doer , a putter-togetherer , " insisted he 's " not an exclusionist " and that he would not try to set the party 's philosophical tone . lie kept the leadership and membership selected by outgoing Chairman Jean Westwood for the two reform commissions ? Woodcock-Mikulski ( on rules ) and Sanford-Burke ( on a new charter ? He also promised them financing and staff- g . He was less specific on how the 25 at-large spots will be filled ( " we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he will redeem his pledge to the black caucus to give them nine or ten . He thought his friend Connally and Democrats for Nixon " offer a problem to the party . " And to top it off , Strauss was confident the party 's debt , around S4 million , can be cleared up . Bush had only one sponsor ? the President , and given the present climate in the White flouse , it 's amazing Nixon would turn to one of the more modern and humane Republicans to run the affairs of the GOP , even nominally . Bush is a Connecticut Yankee ( son of the late Senator Prescott Bush ) who , after graduating from Yale ( same class as John Lindsay ) , went to Midland , Texas . There he made his fortune in oil during the post-World War 11 years when the Permian Basin was being opened up . Later , he moved to Houston to run for office , clashed with the strong John Birch wing of the party , publicly solicited support from the black and brown communities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House for two terms . He comes to his post from the UN after winning the battle to get US payments reduced , a victory that will endear him to Nixon 's " New Majority . " That two men so close to the oil and gas industry should rise to the top party posts just when the country is focusing on its energy crisis is something to ponder . One of the major battles of the decade will be over how to resolve that crisis . The industry stand is clear , as evidenced by a three-year study made by the National Petroleum Council ( loaded with industry men ) for the Department of the Interior . Their conclusions : Energy needs will double by 1985 , but private industry can meet the needs if government will get creepy environmentalists off its back , give the oil men their full 271/2 percent depletion allowance , open more federal lands to exploration , keep oil import quotas where they are and stop regulating the price of gas at the well-head . Then we shall have the energy we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paying today . We shall wait and see what Mr. Strauss and Mr. Bush think of that formula . Union Shake-Up Miners for Democracy , the coalition that shoved Tony Boyle out as head of the United Mine Workers , was probably a fluke . Union democracy , best described as one-party government , tends to mean in practice that no serious alternative to the ruling hierarchy is available . The few turnovers that take place are usually palace revolts , like the Abel-McDonald contest in the Steelworkers in 1965 , in which two rival factions slug it out for the spoils . The Miners for Democracy were able to take on the whole organization because men who work underground share the same concerns , right down to the same diseases , especially black lung . Most unions are a collection of different jobs and job interests that excite jealousies and weaken solidarity . Even in the UMW , soft coal miners feared that higher pensions for hard coal miners would mean lower pensions for them . In most labor unions , spread out over 50 states , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opposition ; the MFD rank and file is concentrated in a few Appalachian states . Most rank-and-file revolts never raise a nickel from the outside . But in the wake of the Yablonski murders , the MFD became a national philanthropy , and extensive press coverage turned the insurgents ' challenge into the first nationally televised union power11 struggle . Millions of dollars of free network time undoubtedly made a difference in an election which was decided by only 14,000 votes . More important , the Labor Department was willing to spend $4 million to police the polls and seriously crimp the Boyle machine in the crucial last months . For the first time in the history of the Landrum-Griffin Act , the federal government deprived union leaders of their official access to the union treasury to finance their official political operations . Using the act 's Title IV , the insurgents secured a host of special court remedies , including equal space for the MFD views in official union publications . The legal issue that remains unresolved is whether any union hierarchy can make itself as autonomous as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected leadership between the coalfields and the Washington headquarters ; all but three or four districts were in the form of trusteeships , with the district presidents picked by Boyle rather than elected by the miners . An autocratic executive board will still be around to harass UMW President Arnold Miller and the newly elected UMW executives . These Boyle leftovers have what one MFD lawyer called " the mentality of the ' 50s , " from the years when the coal industry was in decline and " the only safe course was to climb in bed with management . " But soft coal mining has been booming , UMW membership has grown , there 's a larger pie to be shared . That development did not go unmentioned by the insurgents , and to it they added other issues , such as black lung , mine safety and the near criminal administration of the UMW pension fund . It was the moral outrage over the Yablonski murders , however , that gave MFD its running start , and that brought it the national publicity and resources no other rank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First You Do n't Succeed The new director of the Office of Management and Budget , Roy L. Ash , previously served as chairman of the President 's advisory council on executive organization , and it was one of his recommendations that led to the creation of OMB . Most of the OMB budget ? almost $250 billion this fiscal year ? is not subject to Executive control . Social Security , unemployment benefits , farm price supports , interest on the national debt and other items which can not be revised up or down total some $185 billion . So whatever innovations Ash may have in mind can apply only to the controllable $65 billion . Ash left his $195,000-a-year post as president of Litton Industries and is divesting himself of his 180,000 shares of common and preferred stock to remove any possibility of a conflict of interest . A founder of Litton in 1953 , Ash watched his company become one of the nation 's largest conglomerates ( 35th on the Fortune 500 ) , and one of the most politically active . According to Congressional Quarterly , executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 Republican campaign than those of any other defense , space or nuclear contractor . Litton climbed from 14th-ranked defense contractor in 1968 to ninth two years later . Ash has said his contributions to Nixon campaigns ran into " five figures in 1968 and 1972 . " ( The 1972 figures for all corporate donors have not yet been made public by the Nixon reelection group . ) Managerial skill is the qualification cited for many of the second-term Nixon appointees , all of whom hope to bring a more businesslike attitude into government . At a press conference following his designation as OMB director , Ash said , " The Government is spending more and more money , certainly an all-time record of money , and the objective is to get our money 's worth . That is the same as in business , and that is the same as I will hope to bring my own background to apply in the Government objective of getting its money 's worth . " To succeed , Ash will have to do better than he did at Litton . From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.2 billion in sales in 1969 , Ash piloted the conglomerate to a 1972 profit of $1 million on $2.5 billion in sales . The company avoided red ink only by including as assets some of the claims it had lodged against the navy . Litton 's stock now sells for about a tenth of its all-time high . Litton is two years behind schedule on its delivery of five amphibious assault ships ( LHAs ) , and last spring the navy threatened to find the company in default of its contract . ( The service backed down at the end of August and put off the day of reckoning six months . ) Litton also appears to have fallen behind schedule on its two contracts to build 30 destroyers ( DD-963s ) . The two contracts are worth more than $3 billion , and the cash flow they generate is crucial to the company 's very survival . The Lesson of Life The reasons given for the loss of Life were competition for advertising from TV , competition from special interest magazines such as Psychology Today and Time , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases of 170 percent over the next five years . The first two pressures are endemic to magazine publishing . The third , exploding second-class postal rates , is not . Congress can cut back the rates by approving HR 16784 , sponsored by Representative Morris Udall ( D , Ariz. ) and S 4020 , sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy ( D , Mass . ) . Until recently , the cost of mailing magazines had been rising about six percent a year . Then came the Postal Reorganization Act of 1971 , a delayed response to the breakdown in services of the 15-story , 60-acre Chicago post office , the world 's largest . Larry O'Brien , then postmaster general , sparked a drive to modernize the postal service . His efforts were supported by the magazine industry , with the expectation that productivity would pick up and second-class rates would go up only modestly . When the " semi-independent " Postal Service replaced the 200-year-old Post Office , the postmaster was removed from the President 's Cabinet ; - mail delivery was to show a profit : no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay its own way ? first class , second class ( magazines and periodicals ) , third class ( advertising matter ) and fourth class ( books and parcels ) . Ascertaining postal cost is an arcane art . Since the buildings and the people are already there , there is more than one way to determine costs . The Postal Service recommended to the Postal Rate Commission that second-class rates go up 142 percent over a five-year period . The commission , in a 300-plus-page report last June 5 , decided that 127 percent was the right figure , and second-class rates rose 30 percent in July . Time , Inc. ' s chairman , Andrew Heiskell , had joined a Citizen 's Committee for Postal Reform to push the O'Brien postal reorganization through the Congress . Subsequently , at a House hearing Heiskell was asked , " Do you consider that you booby trapped yourselves in supporting this legislation ? " " Yes , " he replied . Earlier in his testimony , Heiskell had said , " We are here because they postal ) are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs are not entirely out of control . " In 1970 Time , Inc. ' s second-class mail bill was $15,400,000 ; under the increased rates that figure would be $42,500,000 , " or nearly four times more than we earned from our magazines in 1970 , " Time , Inc. said . Postmaster General Winton M. Blount ( the recently defeated Republican candidate for senator from Alabama ) was not impressed : Life 's " pessimistic " estimate of its ability to bear the " postage increase or to pass it on to your subscribers and advertisers , is certainly not shared by a number of independent appraisers of the magazine industry . " The independent appraisers won the battle , and Life , which had shown a loss of $30 million over the past four years , lost the war . Some described Life as the " last dinosaur , " its " photojournalism " made extinct by television . But its demise was surely hastened by the steep rise in second-class rates and unless Congress acts to prevent it , more publications will follow Life . The Udall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of each issue at only two-thirds of the prevailing second-class rate . The Postal Service says this would cost about $38.4 million annually , against a postal deficit that has increased under the profit-oriented management to a record $2.5 billion this year . The question to be decided is whether a multiplicity and diversity of periodicals is in the public interest . Mr. Udall says yes and that the added cost to the government is justified . Grain Shippers Fat shipping subsidies are exempt from the President 's partiality for leanness in federal expenditures . When federal payments to owners of ships are added to subsidies for grain exporters , the US could pay up to $25 million for the sale of 400 million bushels of American wheat to Russia . The shipowners could get as much as $57 million in payments from the Maritime Administration and the grain firms already have had an estimated $200 million from the Agriculture Department . In the longer perspective of US-Soviet cooperation , the deal can be seen as mutually advantageous , but in the shorter run it can be asked how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay over one-quarter of the $1 billion the Soviets gave for 17 million tons of grain , to get it out of this country . The administration apparently slipped up in letting the Russians buy the wheat at bargain basement prices , since only the US could supply the vast amounts that a crop-damaged USSR needs . But the granting of shipping subsidies was deliberate , part of a long-range Nixon strategy . For years only 12 liner companies plying major world trade routes got subsidies and tax breaks . Then in 1968 Nixon promised the maritime industry he would help it . In 1970 Congress approved the administration 's proposed changes in shipping law , giving subsidies to bulk carriers ( which handle grain ) and extending tax benefits to all shipowners . Teddy Gleason , president of the powerful International Longshoremen 's Union , was not ungrateful and supported the administration in this past election . Told by federal officials such as Robert J. Blackwell , assistant secretary of commerce for maritime affairs , that Russian grain purchases will be a permanent new market , the farmers were likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . Shipping subsidies are generous . For fiscal year 1973 Congress appropriated $232 million to apply to ship operating costs and a payment kitty of $250 million for ship construction . In the case of the grain sales , the shipowners will be collecting money from both Moscow and Washington . Applications for payments ranging from $8 to $10 a ton on Russian grain shipments continue to pour into the Maritime Administration . Companies have filed for subsidies for 56 vessels . The first rates granted by the Maritime Subsidy Board were $10 a ton . Since the board reportedly has only $17 million left over this year for ships which13 can carry grain to Russia , the agency probably will have to go back to Congress for more subsidy money to ensure that the wheat gets delivered . The Russians have agreed to pay $10.34 per ton through December 15 ; $10.12 per ton through December 25 ; and $9.90 per ton through January 25 , 1973 for shipments from Gulf ports to Russian Black Sea ports . These rates are well above the $8.05 a ton , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the October 14 agreement ; they represent a major concession by the Russians that is politically helpful , perhaps even politically essential to the Nixon administration . Before the temporary two-month rate settlement was announced , Maritime Administration officials said that if Russian payments went up significantly above $9 a ton , the US would recover some of its subsidies . The agency claims this provision will prevent shipowners from making windfall profits . Some obvious pluses from the Russian sale are a reduced US balance of payments deficit , increased income for some farmers and inland grain handlers and transporters , and more jobs for the shipping industry . In contrast , the grain exporters ' profits may be another example of " socialism for the rich , " although at least one firm , Cargill , Inc. , says it lost money on the deal and no one has refuted its contention . On the minus side are the squeeze on the supplies of US flour millers and bakers leading toward higher bread prices , and anticipated increases in domestic tanker rates if many ships are diverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices this winter . Since the Russians are hard-up for grain , they might have been persuaded to pay all shipping costs . On the other hand , if they had refused , the administration would have run the risk of jeopardizing much broader trade with the Soviets . As it is , with the US/USSR grain pact safely negotiated , the next logical step is a bilateral trade agreement with Peking , especially since Mr. Nixon has now lifted a 22-year-old ban on corn . mercial ship and aircraft traffic to China .
