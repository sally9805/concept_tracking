When some of Richard Nixon 's Wall Street supporters recently presented him with a two-foot-high stuffed bull , the President reiterated that " I think next year is going to be a very good year . " Then , with the election well in mind , he added : " It better be . " One happy sign is already clear this year : the Administration is at last making progress against inflation . For the year 's first quarter , the consumer price index advanced at an annual rate of only 2.7% , which was less than half the pace that it maintained last year , and the lowest rate since inflation rolled into high gear in 1967 . <P> The major causes of this progress were a marked decline in mortgage interest rates and a dip in automobile prices as dealers discounted heavily to get sales going fast after the General Motors strike . On the other hand , services continued their steady march upward ( except for the mortgage rates , which , like other non-goods , are considered services ) . Food prices rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering that they might be forced higher by an impending corn blight and the drought in the Southwest , and that neither mortgage rates nor auto prices are likely to fall further , few economists are as yet convinced that the price steadiness will be maintained for the year as a whole . <P> Enough Slack . Business is gradually getting better , and there is much question about whether the current economic expansion will start a fresh round of inflation . The President 's Council of Economic Advisers figures that there is still enough slack in demand and production to prevent prices and interest rates from jumping sharply ( although short-term rates have hit bottom and have risen a bit lately ) . Thus , the Administration remains opposed to framing a firm incomes policy , which would include wage-price guidelines . It also has not developed a policy to deal with a major event that will significantly influence the economy later this year : the steel labor negotiations . No decision has been made on whether to accept a strike , in hopes that it might slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest it badly damage the economic recovery .
