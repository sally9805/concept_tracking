txt World War II was unnecessarily provoked by political illusions and was unnecessarily prolonged by blunders , Capt . Sir Basil Liddell Hart has asserted in a history being published tomorrow . The famed military historian said the western Allies went to war to save Poland and to remove a menace to themselves  --  Hitler 's Germany . Commissioned in 1947 " They failed to save Poland from Germany and , in the end , left her in the hands of the Russians , " Liddell Hart wrote . He said they devastated and weakened themselves and ended up poor dependents of the Capt . Basil Liddell Hart United States , facing an even greater menace  --  Soviet Russia . Liddell Hart was a controversial British war writer for almost 50 years . He was correcting proofs of his 22-year , 250,000 word work when he died at age 74 last January . The massive history had been commissioned by Cassell and Co. in 1947 . Tells Pacific Plan Liddell Hart wrote that war became inevitable in Europe , Britain and France had spent years of " expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east . He said they then did a sudden and complete turn around in the spring of 1939 and pledged support to Poland . Liddell Hart called this " a foolish , rash move impossible to carry out " and an " act of provocation " to Hitler . War became inevitable in the Pacific when President Roosevelt embargoed oil shipments to Japan in 1941 until the emperor 's forces withdrew from China , a demand Japan could not accept , Liddell Hart wrote . " There was every reason to expect war in the Pacific after July , " the historian wrote . Liddell Hart said the greatest factor in prolonging the war was the Casablanca declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill for unconditional surrender . That doctrine 's effect was felt in Italy when Mussolini was overthrown , in Germany when Allied armies closed in , and in Japan after submarines had sunk most of that nation 's ships . Military blunders also prolonged the war , he wrote . He cited the failure to exploit the Italian collapse in 1943 and the German collapse in the west in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Pacific , a decision not to bypass the Philippines where Gen. 's " natural desire for a triumphal return prevailed . " Blames Hitler for Defeat Even so , Liddell Hart blamed Hitler for Germany 's defeat . The historian said Hitler did not think Britain and France would fight for Poland nor , after Dunkirk , that Britain would continue the fight , especially after he held up his tanks and let British troops escape . Time and again he overstretched his supply lines , refused to withdraw in time from fatal positions , at Normandy , released his troops in piecemeal fashion and wasted his last reserves in the Battle of the Bulge , Liddell Hart said . Record of Strategy The w r iter ' s history is basically a detailed record of strategy , tactics , troops assignments and battles in every combat area . Usually , he added his own assessment , often provocative , sometimes s u rprising , and frequently controversial . Some opinions : On the atom bomb ? " Not really needed to produce the Japanese surrender . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest of mankind . " On French troops to 1940 ? " They could have held out longer . " On the German invasion of Norway ? " The British charge of Nazi aggression is one of the most palpable cases of hypocrisy in history . " Hits Ike Decision Liddell Hart said Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in effect proReproduced with permissio Franklin D. Roosevelt longed World War II by a decision in August , 1944 . The contention is that Gen. George S. Patton 's Third Army could have shortened the fighting with fuel given instead to the British field marshal , Sir Bernard L. Montgomery . The Briton 's drive northward into Belgium bogged down because of delays by Montgomery and the mistakes of his subordinates , said Liddell Hart . The decision to back Montgomery at the expense of Patton 's wide-ranging tank forces was made when Eisenhower " sought an agreeable solution in a compromise , " the historian wrote . The military heroes who emerge from his history are Heinz Guderian of Germany , whose tankmen scored the breakthru at Sedan that began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " desert fox " who outmaneuvered the British Army for two years in Africa , altho greatly outnumbered , and Patton , the hero of the Allied " end run " out of the Normandy bridgehead . Patton was fur io u s over Eisenhower 's decision to back Montgomery 's drive thru Belgium at the expense of the Third Army , Liddell Hart wrote . Hails Patton 's Drive " The best chance of a quick finish was probably lost when the gas was turned off from Patton 's tanks in the last week of August when they were 100 miles nearer to the Rhine , and its bridges , than the British . " Patton had a keener sense than anyone else on the Allied side of the key importance of persistent pace in pursuit , " Hart said . Regarding Hitler 's refusal to surrender , the historian said that if Allied leaders had provided some assurance as to their peace terms , Hitler 's grip on the German people would have been loosened long before 1945 . Liddell Hart said " the unnecessary prolongation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents ' unconditional surrender , ' proved of profit only to Stalin ? by opening the way for Communist domination of Central Europe .
