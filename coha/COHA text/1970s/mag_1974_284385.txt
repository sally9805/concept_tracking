Two years after scandals that enveloped it during 1972 , ITT Corp. , the giant multinational conglomerate , finds itself in a new scrape . Last week the Federal Trade Commission charged that the ITT Continental Baking Co . Inc. , a subsidiary and the nation 's biggest baker , had engaged in illegal pricing practices to monopolize markets for its Wonder bread . The FTC asked that Continental be divided into two or more separate firms ; in effect , ITT would have to sell off half of the subsidiary . <P> The FTC and Continental are old antagonists ; in 1971 the agency charged that Continental was misleading the public when it implied that Wonder bread was something special , in ads that claimed the loaf " helps build strong bodies twelve ways . " Now the agency accuses ITT management of nagging Continental to build itself up too rapidly ; James Halverson , director of the FTC 'S Bureau of Competition , says that " ITT set profit and market goals for ITT Continental that forced the subsidiary to adopt predatory practices . " According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme : it would use high profits from areas where competition was weak to subsidize below-cost sales of Wonder bread in cities where it faced a strong competitive challenge ; then , when rivals were driven out of business , it would jack up prices again . <P> During 1972 and early 1973 , Halverson says , 43 wholesale bakers operating 80 plants went out of business in the U.S. , and Continental 's tactics " contributed substantially " to their downfall . ITT Continental issued a formal denial of the charges , but would say nothing further .
