ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO 'S NEST Directed by MILOS FORMAN Screenplay by LAWRENCE HAUBEN and BO GOLDMAN <P> Published in 1962 , Ken Kesey 's novel One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest was one of the chief literary contributions to the prevailing cultural mood of the ' 60s . But unlike so many popular artistic and intellectual productions of that era , the book may have the capacity to outlive its historical moment . In telling the story of Randle McMurphy and the brief , abortive rebellion which he organized in an insane asylum , Kesey demonstrated a tough-minded understanding of the subtleties of revolutionaries and revolutions . <P> Sexless Nag . McMurphy is an ambiguous character whose motives are never quite clear . Like revolutionaries who operate on a larger political stage , McMurphy may be acting out of idealism or he may have found a socially acceptable cover for profound psychopathy-or both . Kesey also understood that a belief in the possibility of rebellion is essential to modern man , a fallback position that can be taken up when despair threatens to turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow inmates that McMurphy ultimately acts without understanding what he is doing . The revolt he leads can only put him under the lobotomizer 's knife . Instead , to keep hope alive , his friend , an Indian named Chief Bromden , kills him : if McMurphy is a martyr , his deeds become the stuff of life-sustaining mythology for his wardmates . <P> The movie version of Cuckoo ' s Nest is faithful to the external events of the novel-no complaints there . The tro ble is that it betrays no awareness that the events are subject to multiple interpretations . Jack Nicholson plays Mc Murphy as an unambiguously charming figure , a victim of high spirits , perhaps , but without a dark side or even any gray shadings . He is a fine fellow to spend a couple of hours with , but he has no depth or resonance , and his fate leaves us curiously untouched . Similarly , the zany behavior of his fellows is amusing , but the depth of their need for McMurphy is not even suggested . Finally , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in McMurphy 's little world and his main antagonist . In the book , a good deal of the tension between them is oddly sexual . In the film , Big Nurse ( Louise Fletcher ) is merely a prim , quite sexless nag and a symbol only of niggling institutionalism . So nothing of any dramatic power gets going between her and McMurphy . <P> The fault for this lies in a script that would rather ingratiate than abrade , in direction that is content to realize , in documentary fashion , the ugly surfaces of asylum life . One Flew over the Cuckoo ' s Nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film . But in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that Ken Kesey found in the asylum .
