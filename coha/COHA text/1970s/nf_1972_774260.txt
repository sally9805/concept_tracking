txt  | the testicles . The presence of the seminal fluid in the seminal vesicles , re-acts upon the brain , and the mind glows with voluptuous ideas . Under their influence , men are gallant , kind , attentive , and loving to women ; ever seeking their favours ; ever pressing their suit . It is the part of woman to accept or repulse ; to grant or refuse . It is her right to reign a passional queen ; to say , " thus far shalt thou come , and no farther . " It is for her nature to decide both as to whom she will admit to her embraces , and when ; and there is no despotism upon this earth like that which compels a woman to the embraces of a man she does not love ; or to receive the embraces of a man she does love when her nature does not require them , and when she can not partake in the sexual embrace without injury to herself and danger to her offspring . If a woman has any right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if there is anything in this world she has a right to decide , it is who shall be the father of her children . She has an equal right to decide whether she will have children , and to choose the time for having them . This is a law of nature , respected throughout the animal kingdom . The female everywhere refuses sexual union with the male , except at the appointed season ; and compulsion at any time , and especially during pregnancy , can not be called beastly , for this would be a libel on the brutes . The expressions of love antecedent to , and connected with its ultimation , are varied and beautiful , involving the whole being . Love gives light , and a trembling suffusion to the eye , a soft , tremulous tenderness to the voice , a sweet sadness to the demeanour , or a deep joyousness ; a certain warmth and voluptuousness preside over the movements of the body ; blushes come often to the cheeks , and the eyes are cast down with consciousness ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant idealisation of  | the beloved object , who seems to enamoured eyes clothed with every perfection ; an exquisite delight pervades the sense of feeling ; every touch , even of the garments , gives pleasure to those who love ; hands are clasped with a thrill of delight ; lips meet in rapturous kisses ; and the same instinctive attraction , which brings together the two sexes of the lower animals , acts not less powerfully in man ; but should act always under the influence of tender sentiment , refined feeling , reason and conscience , for the greatest good as well as the highest happiness . This sexual congress , should , for the protection of all concerned , have the sanction of needful social regulations . There are a few practical observations , which may be properly made here , connected with the physiology of the sexual congress . The organs of generation , in both sexes , are excited and stimulated by idleness , luxury , and every form of voluptuousness . Where it is desirable to avoid such excitement , all these must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing , especially the dancing of the stage , the fashionable display of female arms and bosoms , all fond toyings , and personal freedoms between the sexes , must be avoided by those with whom chastity is a necessity of age or circumstance . The lips are supplied with nerves of sensation from the cerebellum ; and the kisses of the lips are sacred to love . The bosom is also supplied with nerves from the same source , and it is in the most direct and intimate sympathy with the female generative organs . A woman of sensibility , who would preserve her chastity , must guard her bosom welL But the best safeguard against one passion , is to arouse another , and , if possible , many others . Friendship is often a safeguard against love ; even the friendship of young persons of opposite sexes . In the family , in  | schools , and in society , the more a friendly familiarity exists , the less likelihood is there of amative excitement and indulgence . Friendship comes so near to love , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes mistaken for it . Business , study , active exercises , amusement , ambition , reverence , a constant occupation of mind and body , divert the vital forces into so many channels , that the system feels no pressing wants in this direction , and men live in the bustli of active life , for months and even years , without amative wants . Women govern themselves much more easily than men . With great numbers , continence is no virtue , for they have not the least attraction for sexual connection , nor are they capable of sexual enjoyment . This is , indeed , a diseased condition , hereditary or acquired ; but it is common to an incredible degree . But even with women of passionate natures , who are capable of the most ardent love , and the fullest enjoyment , certain conditions are necessary to the awakening of sexual desire . They must love , and be beloved . Love must begin in the soul as a sentiment , come down into the heart as a passion , before it can descend into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be continent without the least difficulty , so long as she does not love ; but when she loves a man , she gives herself to him , soul and body . Happy the man who can inspire and respond to such a love ! Happy the child born of such a union ! Happy the human race when there PhQll be no others 1  | IMPREGNATION . THE formation of the zoosperm , or seminal animalcule , in man , and the ovum in woman , belongs to the domain of organic life , yet all the highest powers of the soul , and the soul 's organs , are engaged in the work . For there is to be more than a mere bodily organisation formed ? a mass of bone , muscle , and various tissues . First of all , there is to be generated an immortal soul . The soul of man , like his body , is the creation of Infinite Wisdom and Power , but God works by means and in accordance with fixed laws ; and as bodies are so formed as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in like manner , generate souls . This may be the mode chosen by the Creator ; so that the parents of every child are the parents of its immortal part , as well as its mortal . If souls were made apart , and then came into bodies formed for them , how could they be affected with what theologians call original sin ? the evident depravity which exists in man , and so widely distinguishes him from all other creatures ? It is , in fact , the soul , so generated , if we accept the hypothesis to which analogy points , which forms the body which , for some years , is to be its habitation , the medium of its perceptions , and the instrument of its expression . The generation of souls seems necessary , indeed , to explain the facts of the hereditary transmission of moral and mental , as well as physical qualities . The souls of children ? their moral characters ? are like those of their parents , and compounded of those of their fathers and mothers , s ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We never find the soul of a European in the body of a Hottentot , or the soul of a North American Indian in the body of a native of China . All varieties of human character are expressed in differences of organisation . The physiologist reads them in temperament and general conformation ; the physiognomist sees them written in the lines of the face ; the phrenologist in the developments of the brain ; but all these are effects , not causes . It is not the body that shapes the soul , but the soul that forms the body . It is the brain that gives shape to the skull , and not the skull that circumscribes the brain 's development . It is the faculty that shapes the organ , and not the organ that hampers the faculty . The soul forms the cortical substance of the brain , and from this the whole nervous system ; and it is the nervous system . acting upon the blood , that builds up the whole body , and not , by any means , the reverse of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one flesh , " have thus given to them the power , or are the appointed instruments , of generating a third being ? body , soul , and spirit . They form it according to their own capacities . Or , if the soul have any other origin it must be admitted that they limit its expression and development , and all its earthly manifestation ; so that there are great and little souls , beautiful and ugly souls ; and so on of all varieties of human character . But it must also be admitted that there are facts of human intelligence and goodness not easily accounted for upon the theory of hereditary transmission . How came a Shakespeare to spring up in Warwickshire ? What do we know of the progenitors of our greatest geniuses in every department of human achievement ? We must admit of other influences ? of supernal inspirations.  | It may be that if we could know the conditions and peculiar relations and elevations of the souls of parents in the generation of souls of genius , we might see a solution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see that , as a general rule , in families , nations , and races , the children resemble their parents . English , Scottish , Welsh , Irish , have peculiarities as marked as Chinese , Negroes , North American Indians , and Esquimaux . And the soul grows like as the body grows , and changes as the body changes , and grows strong by exercise , and great by the reception of soul nutriment ; and is prepared to generate still higher souls : and this is the law of education , development , progress . So we have diseases of the soul as of the body ; these re-acting on each other ; and each susceptible of proper curative treatment . Does not the mind feed on thoughts and feelings , and get starved or surfeited , and grow dyspeptic on trash or sweetmeats , or exhilarated and intoxicated ? Who has not felt his whole soul strengthened by communion with some strong spirit ? This sublime function of the generation of human beings , soul and body , is performed by the two male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted upon by every human faculty , and modified by every human circumstance and action . It is not in my power to solve the questions respecting the portions of the mental and physical organisation , contributed by either parent . I see no reason to believe in any such partition . I think each has a share in the formation of every part , though in any part the influence of one or the other may preponderate . A child may resemble either of its parents , or both , or it may be more like one of its grandparents than either . It may have more of the mind of one , or the physical constitution of the other , or both may  | be evenly mingled . If a man have a powerfullydeveloped and active mind , and a woman a vigorous organic system , it is likely that their child will resemble each in their strongest points . Germ cell and sperm cell , I believe , are both engaged in the formation of every faculty and organ . The sperm cell is the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ composed of a vast surface of tubular structure , and amply supplied with nerve and blood , by which , and out of which , these animate cells are formed . Then , within the primitive sperm cell , appear cells , and within these are formed , first in a circular mass , a great number of exceedingly minute living beings , consisting of an ovalshaped body , and a long tail . This self-propelling cell swims in a fluid substance , like the white of an egg , but more opaque , formed partly in the testes , and partly secreted by the prostate gland . In full health and vigour , these zoosperms are very numerous and active ; in sickness or exhaustion they are few and weak , and in certain states of the system they entirely disappear , and the power of fecundation no longer exists . The primitive germ cell first bursts , setting free the smaller cells , and  | these , in turn , liquefy , and set free the now perfected zoosperms ; the seminal fluid containing them then passes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes through the walls of the abdomen , and is received , with the prostatic fluid , according to the common belief , into the seminal vesicles , which are a reservoir in which it is retained , until expelled by the action of the proper muscular apparatus in the sexual orgasm . The zoosperms retain their power of motion , under favourable circumstances , for hours , and even days , after being ejected . In fish , which do not copulate , they swim about in the water , until they come in contact with the eggs spawned by the female . The ripe eggs , or hard roe , may be taken from the body of a female fish , and the testicle , or soft roe , from the male , and fecundation produced by mingling them together , and ponds and rivers may be stocked with fish , by this mode of artificial impregnation . In the generation of mammalia , by the entrance of the penis into the vagina , the spermatic fluid should be thrown into the mouth of the uterus , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallopian tubes , toward the ovaries . But several circumstances may prevent this being accomplished . The male organ may be too short to reach the uterus ; it may not , from some malformation , be even able to effect an entrance into the vagina , and still impregnation may take place ; for the active zoosperms , in great numbers , move every way with a rapid motion , and are able to find their way through the entire length of vagina , uterus , and fallopian tubes . On the other hand , when the womb is too low , in the common ailment of falling of the womb , the semen may pass beyond the mouth of the womb , and be lodged in a deep fold of the vagina , which may prevent impreg ? nation .  | While th testicles are engaged in the evolution of zoosperms , the ovaries of the female are no less active in forming and ripening the ova ; but with this striking difference. , that , while zoosperms are formed by millions , and may be ejected day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in rare cases , from three to five , ova perfected once a month ; and this process ceases during gestation , and should also be suspended during lactation . The ovum , or egg , which , in all its essential parts , is alike in all animals , and which consists of a cell , a nucleus , and a nucleolus , is found in the stroma or mass of the ovary . The egg of the common fowl may be taken as the type of all eggs . Its yolk and white are of immense bulk , compared with its germinal spot , because there must be contained within the shell the entire matter of which the perfect chicken is formed . In the human ovum this matter is small in quantity , as the fetus , from an early period , is nourished by the blood of the mother in the uterus . When this egg is fully formed , ripened , or matured . the cell which envelopes it swells , bursts , and sets it free . It is then grasped by the fimbriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down that passage to the uterus . It may be impregnated at any time after it is set free by the bursting of the graafian vesicle , until its arrival in the uterus , and possibly until its expulsion from that receptacle . It will be seen that conception can only take place under certain well-defined circumstances . First , there must be a ripened ovum , set free from its graafian vesicle . This takes place regularly once a month , after the period of puberty , and in all healthy females is marked by the menstrual evacuation . If this evacuation is coincident with the expulsion of the ovum from the ovary , impregnation must take place , if at all , within eight , or , at most , twelve days of that period . The zoosperms may meet the ovum on its passage , or ,  | possibly , the ovum may find the zoosperm awaiting its arrival . It follows that sexual connection , to answer its natural end , should take place not more than three days before the beginning , or within ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregularities of our lives , with the excitements of stimulating food and general false habits , with the continual over-excitement and exercise of the generative organs , these processes become irregular , and their normal signs not to be depended on . Ova may be prematurely ripened by excitement of the ovaries , caused by sexual indulgence . The menstrual evacuation , which degenerates into a real hemorrhage , becomes irregular and uncertain , as well as depraved in its character . Consequently , the rule that sexual union , to produce impregnation , must take place either immediately before , or a few days after , menstruation , admits of exceptions . It is a safe rule for those who desire to procreate ; but not entirely safe for those who would avoid it , as many , for good reasons , may . Menstruation appears to be a throwing off of the fluids concerned in the ripening and expulsion of the ova . In a perfectly healthy state , the menstrual fluid is very small in quantity , and scarcely tinged with the red colouring matter of the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasts for three or four days , or longer , with the loss of several ounces of blood , mingled with the proper menstrual fluid . There is no better test of the health of a woman than the one I have just given . In what manner the actual impregnation of the ovum takes place , we have no positive knowledge . Microscopic observers assert that they have seen the zoosperm enter the ovum by an opening left for that purpose . It has even been fancied , that the body and tail of the seminal animalcule form the rudiments  | of the brain and spinal cord ! Observations of the progress of fcetal development warrant no such conclusion . If it could be established , it would prove that the animal system of nerves was formed by the male parent , and the organic by the female . The resemblance of children to their parents , arid all the phenomena of hereditary transmission of qualities , prove that both parents are concerned in the production of every part . We have , then , two objects here of microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovum ; the other is the zoosperm , or some portion of it . In each of these minute organisations is comprised the elements of a glorious and immortal being . Each contains , moreover , the rudiments of the very form and qualities of that being , physical , moral , and intellectual . There , in that point of matter , that pellucid cell , we have the shape and air , the talents and genius , the honesty or roguery , the pride or humility , the benevolence or selfishness of the future man . We have what determines the form of his head and hands , the contour of his nose and chin , the colour of his eyes and hair . Moreover , this spermatic animalcule , or this cell germ , has all hereditary idiosyncrasies and diseases , gout , scrofula , venereal taint , or insanity . We can scarcely conceive of this , yet we must admit it . All the grand and energetic qualities that made a Caesar or a Napoleon ? all that can be fairly attributed to blood and birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or both these atoms . I do not underrate the influences that may act upon the foetus during gestation . I give full credit to the power of education in forming the human character ; but I assert that all which makes the basis of the character , mental and physical , must reside in the germ and the spermatozoon , and must combine at the moment of impregnation , or the union of these principles .  | For all the qualities of soul and body which make the differences between a mouse , a dog , a horse , an elephant , must be in their germinal principles . The appearance of the zoosperms in different animals varies slightly under the microscope ? that of the ova scarcely at all . Moreover , when two nearly allied species of animals engender ; when , for example , the zoosperm of the ass unites with the ovum of the mare , each parent is found to contribute to the mental and physical qualities of the offspring . In all crossings of different breeds of animals , we find the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two sexes giving each certain peculiar characteristics . Nor is this by any means less notably the fact in the human species . When sexual commerce takes place between a negro and a white woman , the child partakes of the mental and physical qualities of both . If we do not understand the process by which the union of the male and female elements is accomplished , in the generation of the new being , the conditions under which it must take place are more clear to us . From a multitude of observations , it appears , r . That the ovum , in a state of healthy maturity , must have been set free from the ovary . This is not the case with some of the lower animals . There are insects , in whom a single act of the male will fecundate successive generations . In birds , the male principle seems to be added before the egg is mature . 2 . The sperma must be recent , and must contain living , active zoosperms. 3 . The smallest quantity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conies in contact with the ovum. 4 . It is not necessary that there should be any enjoyment of coition , on the part of the female . Women  | who have none , seem even more prolific than others . It may take place in sleep , or other insensibility . In men , also , the orgasm may be accompanied with no pleasure , and even with pain . 5 . Even the sexual union is not indispensable . There is no doubt that a female ovum may be impregnated by semen conveyed to it artificially ; and a woman , if she chose , might have a child without ever coming into personal contact with a man . This has been shown in animals by abundant experiments , and is said to have occurred in human subjects . There is , however , not the slightest reason to doubt the result , if the experiment were fairly tried . There are a few other points of interest , which may as well be discussed here as elsewhere . Few questions are of more practical importance to the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed . I will give my opinion briefly , stating the reasons where they are not self-evident or apparent . r . The generative act should be performed by two persons arrived at a full development of their powers , physical and intellectual . The children of young and immature parents are apt to be weak and scrofulous . Age can not be given as an absolute index of maturity , and there are some who are never mature . 2 . It should be performed with all the attraction tnd charm of a mutual love ; and the existence of . his is the best evidence that the parties are suitably related to each other ; for those similarities of constitution , which forbid the marriage of near relations , and which often exist without consanguinity , and are sometimes wanting with it , also prevent a true love . Hence , marriages of family interest , convenience , similarity of tastes , and friendship , may be very unfortunate with respect to children . Love , and its functions , require a mingling of opposite qualities .  | : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman he does not love ; and , especially , no woman ought ever to submit to the sexual embrace of a man , unless assured that the union is sanctioned by a mutual affec-tion. 3 . It should not be performed , by man or woman , so as to entail hereditary disease upon their offspring . Insanity , scrofula , consumption , syphilis , diseased amativeness , deformities of body , or distressing singularities of mind , should not be entailed upon posterity . 4 . A woman should avoid conception , if her pelvis is so small , or so deformed , as to hazard her own life in delivery , or destroy that of the child , or compel an abortion . 5 . In the present social state , men and women should refrain from having children , unless they see a reasonable prospect of giving them suitable nurture and education . We have no right to inflict an injury upon an individual or society . But how is pregnancy to be prevented ? There is one way that is natural , simple , and effectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easily done by most women , and by many men . In every civilised community , thousands live in celibacy , many from necessity , many from choice . In England and the older American States , there is a large surplus female population . In catholic countries the whole priesthood , and great numbers of religious , of both sexes , take vows of perpetual chastity . This practice has existed for at least sixteen centuries . I have shown that , in ordinary cases , conception can only take place when connection is had a day or two before , or ten , or , for safety 's sake , say sixteen days after menstruation . There is , then , a fortnight each month , when the female is not liable to impregnation ; but it must be remembered , that if she is amatively excited in this interval , the ripening of  | the ova may he hastened , and the very result precipitated that it is intended to avoid . And it is also to be observed , that the natural period for sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procreation , and that the use of marriage , or the sexual act , for mere pleasure , and using any means to avoid impregnation , are unnatural . It is questionable , therefore , whether we can morally justify the use of any means to prevent conception . If it can ever be justified , it is when a woman is unwillingly compelled to submit to the embraces of her husband , while her health or other conditions forbid her to have children . The limitation of the number of children is advocated as a right and a duty by a class of social reformers , who , at the same time , insist upon the right and even duty of frequent gratification of the amative propensities by all persons who have arrived at the age of puberty , Virtue , chastity , continence , they denounce as unna tural and mischievous . I hold , on the contrary , that the law of a pure and unperverted nature , is the law of chastity , and that it is consistent with the highest health , and the best bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women ; and that men and women can and ought to be as natural and moral , at least , as the lower orders of the animal creation . The secularist philanthropists who teach in several languages and many editions of their favourite book , that it is not only the right , but the duty , of all persons , married or single , from the age of puberty , to have frequent and regular exercise of amativeness ; who hold that what good men in all ages have called virtue is a vice , that chastity is wickedness and continence criminality , and that lewdness , fornication , and adultery are moral duties , are obliged also to advocate the use of preventive checks to an increase of population . Openly advocating universal prostitution , concubinage , and promiscuity , with its  | unavoidable incests and demoralization ; seeking for sensual pleasure rather than the true purposes of the sexual relation ; wishing to enjoy a selfish gratification and to avoid the burthens and responsibilities which naturally belong to it , they teach that it is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every mode of prevention , other than that of living in chastity , is an evident violation of nature , and can only be resorted to as a choice between unavoidable evils . Pressure upon the urethra causes disease ; withdrawal is little better than masturbation ? the sin of Onan . The very thought and intention of enjoying a natural pleasure and at the same time doing something to hinder the natural effect of such enjoyment , is a source of evil . The soul participates in the act and the enjoyment ; but when pleasure is divorced from the natural motive and use , it becomes a mere sensual gratification , against which conscience protests and even instinct revolts . Our only safety , and our highest good , in this as in all things , is in finding what is true , natural , and therefore in accordance with the law of life written in our moral and physical constitution , This is the path of health , purity . and happiness . MORALS OF THE SEXUAL RELATION . HERE , as well as anywhere , I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of what it seems well for every one to know of what we may call the ethics of the sexual relation . From birth to puberty , or the period when the sexual organs assume their natural functions , which  | is at the age of about seventeen in males and fifteen in females , with variations of a year or two , over and under , ? during the period of infancy and adolescence , there should be no excitement , no irritation , no action of any kind in the amative system ; but perfect purity in thought , and word , and deed . It would be well if children had no sensation and no idea of sex . Unfortunately , the exciting and diseasing habits of civilisation tend to produce an unhealthy precocity in the young of both sexes . Children either fall into habits of solitary vice ? from hereditary predisposition , or a stimulating diet , ? or they are taught libidinous and destructive practices by ignorant or unprincipled servants , or companions or schoolfellows who have been in some way corrupted . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be best ? but the risk of trying to do so is so great , that it seems to me better that every child should be taught , as early as it has the power to sin and the liability to suffer , what is the sin against nature it has to avoid . It is a terrible thing that the whole life of a beautiful boy or girl should be wrecked , because , in pure ignorance , he or she falls into a bad habit spontaneously , or is taught it by another . Surely it would be better if every child were clearly told and solemnly warned of its danger . Of the practice of masturbation , and its terrible consequences , more will be found in the chapters on disease . With the period of puberty , sometimes before , comes the season of sentimental love . And this love should be kept entirely free from the physical or reproductive element . Pure love is chastening and refining in its influence . It is imaginative , poetical , tender , romantic , heroic ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take place until the bodily powers are considerably matured , there should not be in early  | love any desire or even thought of sexual union . The law of the purest and highest life is perfect purity , complete chastity , entire continence , before marriage . Society rigorously insists upon this with respect to women . Every man wishes his bride to come to his arms a virgin ; but the law of nature is the same for both sexes . All women have an equal right to marry ? all should come purely to the marriage bed . If young men are to have a license denied to young women , what are the means ? Either adultery , which is such a crime that men justify the husband who kills both wife and paramour ; or the seduction , ruin , and prostitution of unmarried women . What is right for one sex must be right for both ; what is wrong for one must be wrong for both . There can be no right of men to destroy a certain number of women , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those they marry may be virtuous . We must either stand upon the Christian rule of sexual morality , or admit of universal license . We must have chaste youth and virtuous manhood and womanhood , or see our social world become one vast brothel of unbridled lust . The law of married life is one of temperance or moderation ? a natural use of marriage for its chief object , the begetting of offspring . The law of the whole animal world is sexual connection for the purpose of reproduction , only at such times and in such quantity as best favours that result . The females of all the animal races , insects , birds , beasts , in this matter govern , and admit the access of males only when they require it for the fecundation of germs and the production of offspring . They sternly refuse at all other times , and we should detest any animal that made pleasure alone the motive of sexual union . There can be no doubt that this is also the natural and healthful law of the human species .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrown off once a month . This , then , is the natural period of the sexual congress . It should take place when both parties are in full vigour ? never in fatigue , never when exhausted by bodily or mental toil , never in sickness ; above all , never when intoxicated . Body and mind should be free from all excitement but that of love , from all perturbation but that of a healthy desire . The condition of both parents at this period affects that of their offspring . There should be no excess , no exhaustion . The act should never be more than twice or thrice repeated , awaiting the result ; and the congress should not be renewed until the next monthly period . If the menses do not appear , it is a sign that conception has taken place , and the expectant mother must then be sacred from all approach or the least amative excitement through the whole period of pregnancy and nursing . This law is respected by savages , and is regarded over a large part of the civilised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horses , or cattle , or animals of any kind , would permit intercourse while they were with young ? and the human female should assuredly be held as sacred . A word of advice is needed for the young . The first union ? the consummation of marriage ? needs great care . The bride a man takes to his heart should be treated with exceeding delicacy . There should be no word or act to shock her modesty . The lover who has become a husband should be sober , discreet , and very careful to do her no injury , He can wait . It is a great happiness to wait , and to ask nothing until she is willing to grant him all . And in the embrace in which all is given , there must still be great care not to hurt , nor to injure a delicate organism . The vagina may be contracted ? give it time to expand . The hymen may not readily yield ? do not rupture it too rudely . Wait until the pleasure shall overcome the pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in all this intercourse , if one would preserve its bloom and sweetness , there should be the same tenderness , the same delicacy , the same unselfish regard for the happiness of the other . The best writer on this whole subject of marriage is St. Paul , and his luminous epistles I cornmerd to every reader . In an honest and true love there is no cause and no room for jealously . " Perfect love casteth out fear . " The power of producing germs in the ovaries , which by fecundation develope into offspring , begins in woman with , or in some cases even before , menstruation , and continues to the " turn of life , " or the period when it ceases , usually at from forty-five to fifty-five years of age . Men have the power of procreation sometimes to a very advanced age , and some have begotten children when more than a hundred years old . But this power should be used with great care and temperance by the aged ; and those who would live long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to refrain from it altogether . After fifty , sexual pleasures are very exhausting . They often bring on paralysis or apoplexy . The strongest old men are celebates , or those who live in perfect continence . A woman who wishes to guard the health and life of her husband , must induce him to entirely refrain from amative indulgence . Great numbers of women can easily refrain , for they have no desire , and no enjoyment . Either they are born so , or have lost the power of pleasure by early abuse or excess , or by frequent child-birth , or abortions and miscarriages . In some way , they do not possess , or they lose all sensibility . But with many women , also , it is voluntary . While they submit to the demands of their husbands , they can withhold any participation . They may become pregnant , all the same . Many women have families of children without  | the least enjoyment of the sexual embrace . Women are sometimes deeply injured in their nervous systems by the efforts of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their enjoyments . Certain kinds of food and drinks stimulate the amative propensity and its organism . " Oysters and eggs are amatory food , " which is also true of game , fish , and of animal food generally ; whose effect is much increased by salt , pepper , and spices . Coffee and chocolate and all rich wines have the same effect . Strong coffee is one of the most active of amatory stimulants . Alcohol does not so much stimulate lust , as dull the sense of caution , and the scruples that restrain men and women from enjoyment . The woman who drinks with her lover , is in his power . There are drugs which quiet the amative feeling . This sedative influence is attributed to tobacco ; and satyriasis in men , and furor uterinus in women ? manias of unbridled lust ? are treated with doses of the carbonates of sodium and potassium . A full diet provokes to lust ; so does idleness of mind or body . The vital force must act in some direction ; and if we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must direct it to other and nobler uses . Perfect temperance , and even abstinence , or a pure , bland , simple , and very spare diet ? bread , fruit , and cooling vegetables for food , and water for drink , with the love and desire of purity , and a varied activity of body and mind , are the best remedies . He who bathes daily , takes much active exercise , abstains from stimulants , lives on simple fare , does not eat after four o'clock , and sleeps on a hard bed with a light covering , will have little trouble from a disordered amativeness . It is evident to every observer of human nature that the influence of sex runs through the whole mental and moral character . Men differ from women as much in brain as in body . They have certain organs  | relatively larger , and others relatively smaller , than women . The moral organs correspond intimately with all physical differences . If we could compare the most masculine woman with the most feminine man , there would still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that woman was intended to be the slave , the tool , and the victim of man , as she is and has been . In making her such , man wrongs his own nature as much as he wrongs hers , and he wrongs the whole human race . If man would follow his own pure instincts , woman would have nothing to complain of and nothing to desire . By the rights of her love , by the power of her beauty , by the strength and tenderness of her passional nature , she would be acknowledged as the queen of the social universe ; while man would reign in the sphere of intellect and material achievement . It can not be necessary in a Christian country to speak of those unnatural sexual crimes which shock society , and are sometimes punished by the laws . The sin of Sodom is found to some extent in the army , the navy , and in prisons , and is not unknown in the Metropolis . We read in the papers brief mention of prosecutions for other unnatural crimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations of the very ignorant and very poor , that it is seldom punished . The marriages of near relations are also far too frequent ; for there can be no doubt of their bad effect upon the bodily and mental organisation of their offspring . In a true society there would be no marriages of interest or consanguinity . The law of love is like that of magnetism ? the attraction of opposites .  | EVOLUTION OF THE FETUS . THE ovum once impregnated , Nature , by which I mean the informing soul that presides over the whole organic system , and gives intelligent guidance to every part , carries forward its development , as nearly as can be observed , in the following order : The ovum is , from the first , enveloped in two membranes , the outer of which is called the chorion , the inner the amnion . Within lies the principle of life , the germ of the complex being . The ova of all the higher animals are alike at this period , and one can not be distinguished from another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner surface the liquid in which the foetus is suspended during the whole period of gestation . The chorion , or outer covering , on the other hand , acts outwardly , throwing out villi , which , gathered at one point , at a certain period unite with vessels on the inner surface of the uterus , and form the placenta , or afterbirth , by which the fcetus is nourished from the blood of the mother . The central germinal point of the egg , and its two coverings , form the three parts of a regular cell formation ? cell , nucleus , and nucleolus . While the ovum is gradually passing down the fallopian tube , propelled by the action of its ciliary bodies , a journey which lasts from eight to fourteen days , and in the course of which it is liable to impregnation , the uterus is preparing for its reception . A delicate secretion is poured out over its whole internal surface , which is organised into a membrane called the decidua , so that when the ovum arrives at the lower end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the uterus ,  | called the decidua vera , or true membrane ; the inner , the decidua reflexa , or folded membrane . We have the ovum now protected by no less than four membranes ? two proper to itself , the amnion and chorion , and the two formed by the folded decidua of the uterus . During its passage down the fallopian tube , the entire ovum is so small that it is with great difficulty it can be found by the closest inspection and the aid of a powerful microscope . When found , however , and subjected to a high magnifying power , it exhibits the same phenomena as is displayed in the incubation of any other egg . There is the yolk , the germinal spot , which gradually expands , and the formation , first of blood , and an external circulation , Footnote  | and then of the rudimental organs ; but these latter changes take place in the uterus . From my more recent work , " HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY the Basis of Sanitary and Social Science , " Part IV. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations : " The human ovum , at its impregnation , is very small ? smaller than the naked eye can distinguish . It is from the 1-izoth to the 1-i4oth of an inch in diameter . But from the moment of fecundation it grows with great energy . In a fortnight it is of the size represented in Fig. 34 . The foetus of one month is an inch long ; two months , two inches and a half long ; three months , five inches ; five months , six or seven inches ; seven months , eleven inches ; eight months , fourteen open . inches ; nine months , eighteen inches . " The interior structure of the ovum , and the gradual development of the germ , embryo , and foetus , are best explained and illustrated by reference to the larger eggs of fishes and birds . The hen 's egg may be taken as a model , and when a hen is setting , or , more humanely , when eggs are being hatched by artificial heat , if one be broken every second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great facility . Footnote  | Nature , it will be seen , has prepared everything , forgotten nothing , and goes on in the formation of a new being , insect , bird , or man , with the same wisdom and power that creates a universe . " The first step in development in the yolk of the egg must be the vitalisation of its matter ? further vitalisation , I should say , for it is already alive ? an organised existence . But the entrance of the masculine element into two layers . e , e . Limits of the second and thicker albumen. f . Limits of the third and thickest albumen , the white being in three layers . g , g .

The egg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the germ is always uppermost .  | ? or its union with the feminine element , whatever they may be ? gives a new and very intense life . There is a diffusion , perhaps a rapid spreading growth of fibres of the nerves of organic life . Under their influence cells are formed of matter already fitted for such structures . These cells undergo rapid transformations , and become the blood , muscle , bone , all the tissues of the young animal . In the egg , these cells are seen to become more opaque in some parts , more transparent in others ; they divide and subdivide , until the yolk forms what is called a mulberry mass . A germ gathers upon the surface , and separates into three layers . In the eggs of fishes , which are so transparent as to be easily watched through the process of development , may be seen an upper or nervous layer , in which are formed the organs of animal life ? bones , muscles , brain and nerves , etc . The lower layer gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viscera , intestines , or alimentary system ; the intermediate layer produces the heart , arteries , veins , etc. , of the system of circulation . " At a very early period , the general form of the insect or animal is manifested . In insects and crustaceans , the germ is divided into sections . In the germs of vertebrate animals , there is seen the rudiments of a spinal canal , which , when formed , is filled with a fluid , from which is formed the brain and spinal cord . The embryo rests upon the yolk , and covers it like a cap , vertebrates enclosing it by the edges uniting at the navel . In fishes , whose embryonic development has been carefully observed by Professor Agassiz , the first lines of the embryo appear on the tenth day ? a canal , which becomes a tube ? the spine , and an enlargement at one end , the rudimentary head , in which may soon be seen a division of the brain for the organs of sight , hearing , and smell ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . About the seventeenth day the heart is seen as a simple cavity , and , as soon as it is closed , there are regular contractions and a movement of blood corpuscles . On the thirtieth day there is a regular circulation of blood ; the tail gets free , and moves in violent jerks , and the head is soon liberated . The fish has a brain , an intestine , a pulsating heart , and a limited amount of spontaneous motion ; but its form is not clearly defined . By the fortieth day , the shape of the fish is evident , the remains of the yolk hang in a bag to its belly , but it soon becomes absorbed , and then the fish is obliged to seek its own food , having exhausted its embryonic provision . " The condition of the fish about the thirtieth day is shown in the embryo of the fowl as early as the eighth day ? Fig. 37 , where the head forms more than half the animal , and the eye is out of all proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane and vessels , which unite to form the umbilicus , the yolk of the egg being to the embryo-chicken what the placenta and blood of the mother are to the human foetus . " In the uterus , the growth of the new being is rapid . Still , in the human subject , up to the seventh day , nothing is visible to the naked eye . On the tenth Footnote  | day , there may be perceived a semi-transparent , grayish flake . On the twelfth there is a vesicle , nearly of the size of a pea , filled with fluid , in the middle of which swims an opaque spot , presenting the first appearance of an embryo , which may be clearly seen as an oblong or curved body , according as it is viewed , and plainly visible to the naked eye on the fourteenth day . The entire weight of the embryo and its two investing membranes , waters , etc. , is now about one grain . The increase from the first is astonishingly rapid , when we consider its original minuteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a lettuce-seed ; its length is four or five lines , and it weighs three or four grains . Many of its parts now begin to show themselves , especially the cartilaginous beginnings of the bones of the spinal column , the heart , brain , etc . On the thirteenth day the embryo is as large as a horse-fly , and resembles a worm bent together . There are as yet no limbs , and the head is larger than the rest of the body . When stretched out , the embryo is nearly half an inch long . In the seventh week bone begins to form in the lower jaw and clavicle . Narrow streaks on each side of the vertebral column show the beginning of the ribs ; the heart is perfecting its form ; the brain enlarged , and the eye and ear growing more perfect , and the limbs sprouting from the body . The lungs are mere sacs , about one line in length , and the trachea is a delicate thread , but the liver is very large . The Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed the renal capsules and kidneys , and the sexual organs are speedily evolved , but the sex of the foetus is not determined until some time after . The embryo is now nine lines , or three-fourths of an inch , in length . Footnote  | In the eighth week the embryo is an inch long , weighs a drachm , and begins to show the division of fingers and toes . At from sixty to seventy days , the development is rapid , and all the parts are in the course of progressive formation . The eyes enlarge , the lids are visible , the nose grows prominent , the mouth enlarges , the external ear is formed , the brain is soft and pulpy , the neck well defined , and the heart fully developed . At three months , the eyelids are distinct , but shut , the lips are drawn together , the organs of generation very prominent in both sexes , both penis and clitoris being remarkably elongated . The heart beats with force , the larger vessels carry red blood , the fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the foetus is four or five inches in length , and weighs about two and a half ounces . At four months , it has greatly expanded in all its parts . The abdominal muscles are formed , and the intestines are no longer visible . At five months , the lungs have increased , and are even susceptible of a slight dilatation . The skin is now in process of formation , the place of the nails is marked , and meconium gathers in the intestines , showing the action of excretory glands . Length , eight or ten inches ; weight , fourteen or sixteen ounces . At six months , a little down appears upon the head , the areolar tissue is abundant , and fat begins to be deposited . Length , nine to twelve inches ; weight one pound . At seven months , every part has increased in volume and perfection ; the bony system is nearly complete . Length , twelve to fourteen inches ; weight , two and a  | half to three pounds . This is reckoned as the epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if expelled from the uterus , is capable of independent existence . From this period up to nine months , there is a mere increase of size and action . The red blood circulates in the capillaries , and the skin performs the function of perspiration . Length , eighteen to twentytwo inches ; weight , from five to eight pounds . There are cases in which an ill-nurtured fetus , at its full period , does not weigh more than two or three pounds ; on the other hand , cases are not rare in which the weight is twelve or fifteen pounds . During the first weeks of the evolution of the embryo in the uterus , it is nourished , as the young chicken is , by the yolk of the egg . But soon the villi of the chorion gather into a compact mass , and become adherent to some portion of the uterus . There is formed thus a placenta , made of two portions , the maternal side , toward the walls of the foetal , in which the vessels unite into two arteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their envelopments , form the umbilical cord , and communicate with the foetal heart . By this means , at every pulsation of the heart , blood  | is sent through the two umbilical arteries to the placenta . Here the vessels branch out into capillaries , which mingle with those of the maternal placenta , communicating with the uterus . Through the membranous coats of these vessels , the blood of the foetus is nourished and purified . It receives nutritious matter and oxygen ; it gives out carbonic acid . The placenta answers for the foetus then , the double purpose of stomach and lungs . The foetus has its own individual circulation and life ; but all its nutriment , from the time this connection is formed , until it is severed at birth , comes from the mother . The regular period of pregnancy in the human female ends with the tenth lunar month , or fortieth week . Physiologists have asked why the process necessary to expulsion should be set up at this period . When they have given an intelligible explanation of any vital periodicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements of the universe , whether marked  | by the beatings of the heart , and the movements of respiration , or the cycles of the stars , which require millions of millions of years for their completion . Regularities of action , and consequent accuracy of periods , are inherent qualities of the intelligent soul , animal or organic . It is the organic soul that presides over the development of the fetus , and fixes the time for its expulsion . But this intelligent soul is not a machine . It has the power , for good reasons , to bring on the process of labour earlier , or postpone it to a later period . The normal period of pregnancy is forty weeks , or nine months , reckoning from the last menstrual period . But as some persons have a quicker pulse than others , so , in some , the vital processes may be more rapid . There are also diseased irregularities which vary the time . Even domestic animals vary weeks in their periods . A gestation , even in a tolerably healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in disease , still further . On the other hand , it may come on prematurely . There have been cases where a fcetus of six months has been born , and lived ; but seven months is generally considered the period of viability . At this time , even where miscarriages are artificially produced , it is said that two children out of three live . A reasonable man may be satisfied of the legitimacy of his child , if he has not been absent from its mother more than ten months at the period of its birth ; and if he can count eight months from his first connection to the birth of a full-grown infant , he has no reason to be dissatisfied . Seven months children are said to occur oftenest in a first pregnancy . There is no probability , I might say , possibility , that when the uterus is occupied by one foetus , and all avenues to the ovaries are blocked up , another later conception can take place . But there is no  | reason wny a woman may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at nearly the same time ; and there are several cases in which twins have been born , one white and the other mulatto , or mulatto and black , in which the mother avowed that such a state of facts existed . In the same way , a litter of pups may be sired by several males , each pup bearing a resemblance to its particular father . OF PREGNANCY . I HAVE something to say now of the condition of the mother , and of her relation to her offspring during the interesting period of gestation . And first , how she may know when conception has taken place . A woman has reason to believe herself pregnant when several circumstances combine to render it probable . r . If she has had sexual connection at the proper period ; that is within five days before or ten days after the monthly period . 2 . If , after sexual connection , the periodical discharge does not again occur . 3 . If she have nausea in the morning , with unaccustomed antipathies or likings for persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts and a dark areola around the nipple , with pimples . 5 . If she have a difficulty in restraining her urine . 6 . If , after a short time , there is a gradual enlargement of the abdomen , becoming rapid and evident at the third or fourth month . 7 . If she feel the motions of the child at and after this period .  | Not one of these signs is certain ; yet , where they all exist , there is a pretty strong probability . Thus , a woman may have sexual intercourse for years without conception ; the menstrual function may cease from numerous derangements of the system ; hysteria , or any ovarian irritation , may occasion strange mental peculiarities , antipathies , or longings ; pains in the breast and areola may arise from similar causes ; there may be irritation of the neck of the bladder , from falling or other displacements of the uterus ; the abdomen may enlarge from tumor , dropsy , or even obstructed menstruation ; and the motions of a child are often simulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are signs , however , which are more certain , with a careful professional examination . After the third month it is possible to hear the beating of the fcetal heart , by placing the ear , or a stethescope , upon the mother 's abdomen ; possible to hear the souffle of the blood in the placenta ; and to feel the weight of the fetus upon the point of the finger , properly applied at its lowest part , within the vagina . The first is a certain sound ; the second may be confounded with other vascular action ; and in the third case a tumor in the uterus may not be distinguishable from a fetus . An old writer , in speaking of the caution to be used in doubtful cases , says you must never give a decided opinion , until you have the child 's head in your hand . At a certain period of fcetal growth , there occurs a rapid increase , a rising of the uterus in the abdomen , and muscular motion in the fetus ; and this period is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquires a vitality or personality at this period , and that it is a greater crime to procure an abortion after than before it . There is not the slightest physiological ground for such an idea . The principle of life is there from the first . The act is essentially the  | same , at whatever period it is performed ; or , if there is any difference in criminality , it is a gradual increase , according to the period , from the first day to the last . The ovum belongs to the mother ? she alone has a right to decide whether it shall be impregnated . That decision must be based upon her mental and physical condition , her desire for offspring , her ability to take proper care of it , and her social relations . But when a woman has united with a man in the creative act , the life of the being so formed is sacred . From the moment of conception it is a human life with all its possibilities , temporal and eternal . There may be circumstances which justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the embryo , or foetus ; such as a degree of deformity that prevents delivery . In such a case no medical man would hesitate to sacrifice the foetus , to protect the life of the mother . This is as far , perhaps , as his responsibility extends . If a woman destroys her unborn offspring , to save what is more than life to her , and to avoid what is to many worse than death , we may pity her ; but her action can not be justified . It is an act of murder ; a crime against nature . But it is a very common crime among tribes of savages , and in the highest civilisation . In America , and to some extent probably in every country in Europe , there are persons , physicians and others , who make a living ? fortunes in some instances ? by giving drugs , or performing operations to procure abortions , not only on girls , to save them from disgrace , but upon married women , to relieve them from the inconveniences of childbearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , in all cases , a violent and unnatural process , it is always attended with a degree of danger , chiefly from a liability to uterine hemorrhage , or flooding .  | The most common mode of procuring abortion is by sexual intercourse during pregnancy . Every woman who permits it , does it with this risk . When a woman is weak in constitution , or strongly amative ; when a man is violent in his manifestations , or the womb is low , there is always the liability to procure the expulsion of the foetus . All amative excitement on the part of the female perils the existence , as it injures the proper growth , and injuriously affects the character of the child . The excited uterus expels the embryo , and in thousands of cases this goes on , year after year , and people wonder they have no children . Women who have neither passion nor pleasure are less liable toabortion from this cause than others ; but if procunng abortion be a crime , is it less so when done in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body , or violent passions of the mind , tend to abortion and miscarriage . Women of weak constitutions should carefully avoid both . Errors of diet , exhausting labours and cares , bring on abortions and miscarriages . They use up the stock of vitality , or the organic force which should go to the fetus . It dies , and is expelled . So perish thousands of unborn infants ; and as care and poverty increase in our great cities , so increase the number of still-born children . The use of drugs and the lancet is a prolific cause . Whatever depresses or deranges the vital functions may be a cause of abortion . Blood-letting and drug poisoning do both . There is no doubt that thousands of infant germs are poisoned in the uterus by allopathic medication , while still more are born diseased from the same cause . The doctor poisons the blood of the mother , and from this the blood of the child draws its nourishment . When abortion is wilfully procured , it is by one of two methods ? drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former the mother is poisoned , sometimes fatally , in the effort to expel the child . The surgical method , that of rupturing the membranes , is the simplest method , but not unattended with danger . The most recent plan is to introduce a slender bougie into the uterus and let it remain until it induces contractions . In a proper social condition , I see no reason why any woman should ever desire to procure an abortion . In the prevalent unnatural conditions of society , and the diseased state of women , morally and physically , it has become a custom of shocking frequency . The direct physical influence of the father upon the child ceases with the act of impregnation . All after influence must be through the mother , or of an aromal , or what is termed a magnetic character . If the woman , in this interesting period of her life , is folded day and night in the arms of love , and lives in an atmosphere of tender care , she receives strength every hour , and the child may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is no question of the influence of the mother . If her blood is pure , the child is built up in purity . If she has an abundant vitality , her child drinks from a full fountain . Every thing that disorders the mother affects the child . If ever all the laws of health are strictly obeyed , it should be during gestation . An impression upon the mother , of any kind , acts upon the child . Children are born happy or miserable , according to the state of their mothers during pregnancy , just as they are born healthy or diseased . Particular talents , tendencies , tastes , idiosyncrasies , and affections of every kind , are impressed upon them , and govern their future lives . The mother of Napoleon , while carrying him , accompanied her husband in a military campaign . The most extraordinary peculiarities are inflicted upon children by some temporary  | condition of the mother ; and there is abundant proof that this may extend to the body as well as the mind . The facts of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not account for them . Alas ! for what can they account ? Such observations as I have been able to make , induce me to think that the sex of a child is determined by the relative vigour of the parents . The father , from maturity , force of will , or superior strength of the procreative function , may give the masculine development ; or the mother , from similar causes , may give the feminine . Where men of mature age cohabit with women much younger , there is an excess of males ; but in countries where the customs of polygamy prevail , and a man 's vital force is expended on several women , there will be more daughters than sons born to him ; so that polygamy perpetuates itself . Where monogamic relations prevail , the sexes are born in nearly equal numbers . Pregnant women are sometimes affected with the most extraordinary longings , and there is a prevailing impression that they must have what they long for , however absurd or hurtful . A woman has longed for a quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most nauseous and indigestible substances . These are states of disease , and should be treated as such . If the article longed for is harmless , as some particular fruit , it should be procured , if possible ; but no woman should be allowed to take arsenic because she longs for it , nor anything else that is positively and necessarily hurtful . The pregnant woman should live on the most simple diet , refraining at this time , above all others , from every thing of a mischievous or doubtful nature ; bathing regularly , taking exercise , and living in the most exact obedience to the laws of life . Doing this , she will escape hysterical and insane longings , or be able to overcome them , with  | great benefit to herself , and without mischief to her child . All observation shows that not only are the striking characteristics of races transmitted , for thousands of years , as with the negroes , the Chinese , the Jews , etc. , but that the qualities and peculiarities of every in dividual are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty exercised during pregnancy by the mother , is strengthened in the child . Thus any mental or moral faculty of the mother may be made striking and active in the child , by being used during pregnancy ; and in this way every mother has in her charge , in a great measure , not only the physical , but the mental and moral character of her offspring . And it is for these reasons that every child should be a child of love , a child of health , and all generous activities ; a child of competence , and freedom from care and the miseries of poverty ; a child of beauty , begotten and developed amid beautiful things and beautiful thoughts ; a child of frank , honest sincerity . If we would improve our race , we must give to the mothers of our race all the conditions of improvement and happiness . The whole process of gestation , it should be remembered , is a natural process , and every part of it should be naturally performed , from the beautiful act of impregnation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most exquisite of all sensual delights , to the grand act of the expulsion of the foetus , and its entrance upon independent life . And this whole process , when accomplished naturally , is one of delight , and not by any means one of disease and pain . Even the process of childbirth , with such a degree of health and strength as may be gained by the water-cure , and a physiological regimen , is rendered speedy , and almost entirely painless . The pain of any organic action is caused by dis-  | ease . Where there is no disease , there can be no pain . There is no reason why the contractions of the uterus may not be as painless as those of the bladder ; and where this organ is in perfect health , they are so . All that a woman wants to secure a painless labour is perfect health ; and her labours will be free from pain , and free from danger , just in proportion as she becomes a healthy being . I have known many cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous labours , have by pure diet , exercise , bathing , and other health conditions , come into such a state of vigour as to pass through this trying period with no danger and very little suffering . During the nine months of pregnancy , in which the happy expectant mother carries the growing babe in her womb , her person should be sacred , her passions calm , her mind serene and full of peace and hope and happiness . No work should weary her , no anxiety disturb her , no lust excite or torment her . She should have daily moderate exercise in the open air , walking or driving ; plenty of fresh , pure air by night and by day ; daily bathing in cold water , with the frequent use of the sitz bath , the wet bandage , and , if possible , the fountain bath , or rising douche or spray ; and also of the vaginal syringe , when there is such need , as will be pointed out in further chapters . Her diet should be moderate , simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and its equivalents , fruit , milk , vegetables , with little , if any , flesh meat . No heating or exciting condiments , and no tea , coffee , or alcoholic stimulants . Her whole life , in short , should be as natural and therefore as healthful as she can make it . And in her body , and mind , and soul , she should be just what she would wish her unborn child to be in all its future life ; for its health and happiness depend in a great measure on the state of the mother luring this important period .  | SYMPTOMS OF HEALTH . YtEDICAL books are filled with descriptions , symptoms , and causes of disease . I wish to give a clear description , enumerate the symptoms , and guide my reader to a knowledge of the conditions of health . Doctors have not been , as a rule , required to keep people in health , but to cure their diseases . It is very seldom that a man sends for a physician and says to him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , and I want you to give us such directions as will keep us so . " People wait until they are ill , and then send for the doctor to cure them . Therefore , it is not the interest of doctors to study health , but disease ; it is not their interest to preserve the health of the public ? their living depends upon the contrary condition . If doctors were paid in proportion to the health of the community , and their incomes were diminished by every epidemic , and every case of disease , we should stand in less need of sanitary legislation . Physicians are interested in disease , as soldiers are in war and lawyers in quarrels . If we had professional peace-makers between individuals and nations , and professional health-makers , well paid for their successful efforts ? paid and honoured in proportion to their success ? it might be different . As it is , it is not for the interest of any physician that health should prevail in communities , that any individual should remain free from sickness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expedited , takes money out of his pocket , and bread out of the mouths of his family . HEALTH is , to every organised being , the condition  | ; if perfect development ; to every sentient being the condition of happiness . HEALTH , in a human being , is the perfection of bodily organisation , intellectual energy , and moral power . HEALTH is the fullest expression of all the faculties and passions of man , acting together in perfect harmony . HEALTH iS entire freedom from pain of body , and discordance of mind . HEALTH iS beauty , energy , purity , holiness , happiness . HEALTH is that condition in which man is the highest known expression of the power and goodness of his Maker . When a man is perfect in his own nature , body and soul , perfect in their harmonious adaptations and action , and living in perfect harmony with nature , with his fellow-man , and with God , he may be said to be in a state of HEALTH . If the organs of the body are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in harmony ; and when a man is in harmony in himself , he is of necessity in harmony with all men , all nature , and with the Source of all things . It is therefore necessary that every minute organ of the body , every faculty of the mind , every power of the soul should be fully formed and active ? all balancing and harmonising each other ; that man should act out all the fulness of his nature , and woman all the glorious beauty of her character , in perfect freedom , and in full enjoyment , to make up the integral condition of HEALTH . BEAUTY is the first sign of health . Health gives development ; and harmonious development is beauty . Every vegetable and every animal is beautiful , accord . ing to its own type of beauty , when it is most perfectly  | developed . And in man or woman , the exact development of every part , and that which enables it to best perform its function , is the highest possible beauty . The handsomest possible head is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most beautiful eye , ear , or nose , are those best adapted to seeing , hearing , and smelling . The loveliest mouth has the best shaped lips and most perfect teeth . The most delicious bosom is the one best fitted for its natural office . The finest limbs are those with the best muscular development . In a word , there is no part of the human figure where the best condition for use is not , at the same time , the condition of the highest beauty , and both together are synonymous with health . Consequently , every deformity , every ugliness , every departure from the standard of the highest beauty of its kind , is a consequence and symptom of disease . 0 ye , who love beauty , and who desire it for yourselves , for your offspring , and for the race , learn that the single way to attain it is by the practice of the laws of health . Be good , and you shall be beautiful as well as happy . Let no man who has a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be sought , admired , loved and worshipped . Another symptom of health is ACTIVITY . Every healthy nerve has a desire to use its power ; every healthy muscle wishes to contract ; every healthy faculty wishes to find exercise and consequent enjoyment . This rule extends to the organic , as well as the animal system . In health the secretions are active , and so are the excretions ; there is a sharp appetite , quick digestion , a full circulation , an earnest respiration , and everywhere an active nutrition . Body and mind are active . All the passions spring into spontaneous activities , alternating with each other , and all contributing to that great variety of action and sensation which constitute the complex phenomenon of Life .  | Indolence , on the other hand , is a consequence and a sign of disease . A torpid organ is a diseased organ . A lazy man is a sick man . Give him health , and his laziness will vanish . Every well man is a busy man . There is no tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to high activities ; and the healthier the world grows , the more varied and active will be its industry . STRENGTH , or energy , is a sign of health ; though a kind of discordant strength , or spasmodic energy , may be a mark of disease . But steady power comes from integrity of constitution . There must be good brain , good nervous fluid , and good muscular fibre , before we can have real strength , and true persistent energy of character and action . These must come from a deep vitality . Men of strong desires , strong passions , strong wills , have strong lives ; and a strong life is generally a long and healthy one . Weakness ? mental , or passional , or physical ? is a sign of disease , as it is a consequence . It is want of development , or exhaustion , or hereditary taint , or acquired morbid condition , or all together , one producing the other . If we blame the weak , the vascillating , the craving , the spiritless , nerveless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what has brought them to this condition . It is a condition of disease , which , if possible , we must cure . HAPPINESS is a sign of health , and withouth health a full enjoyment of life can not exist . A condition of happiness is said to be " a sound mind in a sound body . " This is a simple description of a healthy condition . Happiness is the end or final cause of all sentient life . There is no other conceivable reason for the creation of any being . Happiness is , therefore , the positive and necessary result of every true life , as misery is the inevitable , because equally necessary , result of a false life . As health is the condition  | of a true life , the result and sign of health is happiness . Hence all unhappiness of every kind , all pain , grief , regret , jealousy , discontent , anxiety , is the result of disease , bodily or mental , in ourselves or others . Sorrow seems to me just as much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcry of a sick organism , the other of a wounded spirit . We feel sorrow by sympathy with others ; and there are many persons of sensitive organisations who feel bodily pain the same way . The way to be happy is to be healthy ; and when health is universal , there is no conceivable reason why there should be any unhappiness . There is no happiness without a corresponding degree of health , and no health without a corresponding degree of happiness . THE CONDITIONS OF HEALTH . As health is the simple , natural state of man , when his whole development and life are in accordance with the paws of his being , the CONDITIONS OF HEALTH are ritirely based on the science of physiology or anthrosology . What I prefer to call the conditions of health include the whole science of hygiene , and these conditions are the basis of the laws of life . Without a full observance of them , no human being can have health , which includes in itself beauty , activity , energy , happiness . Without a full observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pains , and every complication of misery , all of which are included in the idea of disease  | These conditions of health can not be observed , if they are not known . We have so neglected a knowledge of ourselves , so perverted ourselves , so far gone astray from nature , that a pure , simple , natural life is almost unknown to us . Our souls are perverted by unnatural beliefs , notions , and habits of thought , as our bodies are by absurd customs , fashions , and habits of action . There is a curious correspondence between our mental and bodily perversions . In both ways , we are out of harmony with nature , and at discordance in ourselves . The first condition of health to every living thing is to be well begotten . The farmer who wishes good crops , selects his seed with care . He does not expect large , clean , sound wheat from small , smutty , shrivelled seed ; healthy lambs from diseased sheep and rams ; good cows and strong oxen from a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an inferior stock . Man is also an animal , and subject to all the laws of hereditary descent which govern the propagation of other animals . Diseased parents beget diseased children ; and the reverse . Long-lived parents beget long-lived children ; and vice versa . There are causes which operate upon the individual in both cases , to modify the effects of hereditary predisposition . A man , gifted with a good constitution from his ancestry , may destroy the principle of longevity in his offspring , though he may live to a good age himself . So a man may transmit to his children a vigorous life-principle , which he may afterwards undermine in himself by his own bad habits . He may die early , in spite of a good constitution ; while his children , inheriting his healthy organisation , may be more fortunate in preserving it . To be well begotten , one 's parents must not only be of a good stock , and have inherited and developed a good organisation , but they must be actually living  | healthy lives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father affects the seminal fluid . For this to be pure and strong and vital , the blood and the nervous power must be in the same condition , and so of the germs prepared by the mother . No unhappy man , no diseased man , no man whose nervous power is exhausted by labour or care ; no man who poisons his blood , and disorders his nerves with stimulants and drugs , can possibly beget a healthy child . Every zoosperm prepared in the testes for the fecundation of the ovum is affected by every cause that affects the parent . There is no condition of body or mind , with which the germ of life may not be affected by either of the parents . The seeds of all follies , vices , and crimes are sown in the organism . The Bible truly says of men , that they had certain characters " from the mother 's womb . " Moral character , intellectual powers and tendencies , physical organisation , health or disease , happiness or misery , are impressed upon the infinitesimal germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaped like an elongated tadpole , is , in reality , a blackguard , a liar , a thief , a scoundrel ; or it is scrofulous , or syphilitic , or gouty ; or it is idiotic , or insane : all these , if formed by a parent of whom these are actual qualities . And so it is of the germ prepared in the ovary of the mother . So the sins of parents are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation , and , where the causes continue , to the thirtieth and fortieth . Father and mother , therefore , at the time of begetting , must be in all pure , and natural , and healthy conditions . If the parents love each other , the child will love its parents . But if a woman submits to be impregnated by a man whom she loathes and hates , that loathing and hatred will be impressed upon the child . It will show it in infancy , and it often lasts through life . Mr. O. S. Fowlcr gives an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his birth , to look at his father , from the impression made upon him by the mother , previous to and during pregnancy . For these reasons , if for no others , sexual commerce should never take place but in a most loving union of congenial souls . Two persons may have sworn eternal love upon a " stack of Bibles ; " but if they do not love , they have no right to have children . Sexual union should never take place in sickness , or depression , or fatigue , nor under the influence of stimulants . Mr. Combe has given a case in which an idiot was the product of sexual union during a drunken frolic . The world is full of miserable wretches , the results of sexual commerce forced upon a loathing wife by a drunken husband . And from this primary condition of health comes the law , that every woman , by her supreme right to herself ; has the right to choose when she will have a child , and by whom . She is to carry it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; she is responsible to her child for its paternity and its development ; and this responsibility carries with it the right of choice in all that affects it . When men are once enlightened on this subject , none but inhuman wretches and monsters will deny these rights . We talk of the evils of slavery , and of the submission of female slaves to their masters ' lusts . Look at the slavery of women over the civilised world , and their submission to the lusts of their masters . Nature is ever kind , and neglects nothing that can benefit her creatures . She exerts her power to preserve the race , even from these evils . What some doctors call the vis medicatrix nature ? the healing power of nature , which tends constantly to growth and healthy development , which heals our wounds , and cures our diseases when we give it a chance , and it is possible to do so ; this power operates ever to purify , strengthen , and elevate . It does much to save the  | child from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we could expect . With all things in nature working together for good , we must not despair , but try to improve by culture and education . With good conditions , and surrounded by good influences , the faults and diseases of birth are gradually eradicated and cured , until scarcely a sign of them remains ; and children , born ugly , diseased , and with unfortunate mental and moral tendencies , may come to be more beautiful , healthy , and good than seemed possible in their infancy . The second condition of health is , that a child should be well born , or , more properly , well borne . The whole state of the mother , during the period of pregnancy , influences the being of the child . Her blood is its nutriment , and that blood must be pure . It is from her nervous system that it derives the elements of its own vitality . Its mental and moral organisation is influenced by hers , and even by her thoughts and feelings . Its muscular structure may be made strong by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children are born with club feet , because mothers would take no exercise during pregnancy . Children are born with dyspepsia , or a tendency to colic , from the mother eating improper food at this period . The food of the mother has so much to do with the condition of the child , and with her power to bring it forth at the proper period without pain or danger , that few things are more important . Numerous experiments prove that a fruit diet , or one composed chiefly of fruit , is the best possible . Too much farinaceous food , especially wheat , promotes the premature hardening of the bones , diminishes the flexibility of the foetus , and increases the difficulty of parturition . No well-informed human mother will live on the flesh of animals during either gestation or lactation . Flesh is not fit to make babies , nor milk to  | feed them . There is no condition of the mother , mental or physical , which may not have its influence upon the child . How careful , then , should every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period ; and how careful should all around ker be to make her life happy ! There is no condition of health necessary to the mother , which is not also necessary to the child , for it partakes of all her life . When we reflect upon the poverty , material and spiritual , that exists everywhere ; upon the discord that enters into the lives of those who are most fortunate ; upon the evil habits of living that surround us ; and all the vices and miseries by which women are enveloped , and to which they are exposed , can we wonder that half the children born die before they are five years old ; that thirty years is the average length of human life , and that , with so many , this brief space is filled with pain and misery ? Pork , tea , coffee , tobacco , beer , whisky , crowded and filthy dwellings , bad air , uncleanly habits , and corresponding pursuits , feelings , and passions , are not the materials of which healthy babies are made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . They are not fit to live , and such a life , when it is prolonged , is a curse , and not a blessing . The same law applies , during the period of nursing , to the mother or the nurse . Every mother should nurse her own child , unless it would be better off without it . A healthy hired nurse is better than a diseased mother ; but the life and habits of the nurse must be under the same control as the mother 's . Neither mother nor nurse , during lactation , should ever be exposed to sexual excitement . Amative indulgence diminishes the quantity of milk , and hurts its quality . And where this indulgence excites menstruation , and results in pregnancy , there is a double misfortune . The child at the breast and the child in  | the womb are both defrauded . There is no doubt that the milk of a healthy , well-behaved cow is better for a child than that of a sickly or vicious mother or nurse . The food , the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of body and mind , influence the quality of the milk . The milk of an indolent mother will not give strength to the child . Even cows kept up in stalls , give milk with much butter and little of the flesh-forming principle , or case . ine . All narcotics , all stimulants , all drug poisons , all impurities in food , or air , or about the person , affect the milk , and the child who feeds upon it . Many a child is kept drunk on tea , or tobacco , or whisky . The nurse drinks her porter or whisky , and the baby grows stupid on milk-punch , drawn from her bosom . And it is " such a good child ! " " Nurses and sleeps all the time . " These are some of the ways in which children are poisoned , killed outright , or made stupid drunkards . Tons of opium are given to the infants of the poor , and they die by thousands in consequence ; but there is not much mourning on account of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health to every organised being . A plant finds its appropriate nourishment in the air , or draws it from the earth . We do not expect a vegetable to flourish in an uncongenial soil , because it is the soil that furnishes a portion of the matter necessary to its growth . It is the same with animals . Every one , from the smallest to the largest , is furnished with its appropriate food by bountiful nature ; and every animal but man eats in a natural state the food that nature intended . The superiority of man over all other animals , is proved by the extent of his perversions . His greater capacity and freedom , which enable him to do greater and nobler deeds , enable him at the same time to do meaner and more debasing ones .  | Vegetables , by careful effort , may be made to grow in soils not specially adapted to nourish them , and in climates not best adapted to their production . So animals may be educated to live on unnatural diet , but this is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-shore learn to live on fish ; a sheep has been taught to eat beefsteak and drink coffee ; and a horse has acquired the filthy and disgraceful habit of chewing tobacco . But no sane man will say that these things are natural or healthy . In the same way man learns to eat and love a great variety of unnatural and hurtful articles of food , such as are not adapted to his digestive organs , or the best nutrition of his system . He also learns to tolerate and love the most nauseous and detestable poisons , of which the wide-spread use of tobacco is a remarkable instance . Man has , in accordance with the energy of his nature , and the versatility of his powers , a greater range of adaptiveness than any other animal . He can live in all climates , by the aid of artificial protection and heat , and he can live on a wide range of alimentary substances . But all experience , all observation , and all science , prove that there are certain kinds of food especially adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of other animals ; and this food is best for health in its widest and most comprehensive meaning . The essential nutriment of vegetables consists of four elements : oxygen , hydrogen , carbon , and nitrogen . These are all found in the atmosphere , in water , and the earth . The same elements are the most essential in animal organisations , but in animals they are obtained from the vegetable kingdom . Thus the vegetable kingdom rests upon the inorganic , and the animal upon the vegetable . Though all animals live upon the products of the  | vegetable kingdom , and though there is no particle of animal nutriment in the world which has not been elaborated by the vegetable kingdom from the inorganic , yet there are many animals who get this food at secondhand , and in various stages of impurity and disease . Animals may be divided into three classes ; the herbivorous , or vegetable-eating animals ; the carnivorous , or flesh-eating ; and the omnivorous , or those who feed upon both . Of vegetable-eating animals we have some who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse , cow , sheep , camel , elephant , etc. , and others who live upon fruits , seeds , nuts , and roots . Of carnivorous beasts , we have some living on freshly killed animals , as the lion , tiger , panther , etc. , while others feed on carrion , as the hyena , wolf , and many birds . The hog is the type of the omnivora . It eats everything ? snakes , toads , carrion , excrement , as well as nuts , seed , fruits . Man , also , is held to belong to this class , and to be even more omnivorous than the hog himself . That he is so by perversion and habit , I shall not deny ; but that he ever is so , in a natural and healthy state , all nature and all science deny . Man has not the claws , nor the teeth , nor the digestive organs , nor the tastes or attractions of a carnivorous animal ; neither has he those of a grasseating animal . The teeth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rend , and cut in pieces . Man 's teeth are made , the front for cutting , the back for mashing and grinding . Those of grass-eating animals are adapted to a peculiar cutting and grinding process , necessary for the comminution of  | coarse vegetable fibre . The digestive canal of the carnivora is shorter and simpler than that of man ; that of the graminivora , or grass-eating tribes , is longer and more complicated . Figure The animals whose teeth , digestive organs , and general physiology bear most resemblance to man , are of the class of frugivorous , or fruit-eating animals , at the head of which , and most resembling man , is the orang outang . This is a strong , active animal , growing to nearly the size of man , which lives on fruit , nuts , and roots .  | The unperverted tastes of every animal point with unerring certainty to its natural diet . Wherever a decaying carcass taints the air , there will be found the foul creatures that feast on carrion ? the hog , the hyena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vulture . Worms and insects finish the feast . The lion and tiger revel in the warm blood of the animals they have just slain , but turn away from carrion . Now what are the natural tastes and attractions of man in respect to food . Reader , you shall be my judge . Let me take you by the hand , and lead you into this garden . It shall be , if you please , the Garden of Eden . Trees loaded with fruit are around you ? vines bending with luscious grapes , beds filled with melons . Here are apples , pears , peaches , plums , nectarines , grapes , figs , oranges , bananas , strawberries , raspberries , and more than I can count . Here , also , are esculent roots , and nutritious seeds , fields of waving grain or golden maize , potatoes , beets , turnips . The air is filled with delicious odours ; every object is full of beauty . Happy children are gathering fruit , or plucking flowers . All around are life and harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , the garden , the orchard , the vineyard , are full of beautiful associations , and not one object , if it properly belongs there , is offensive to the most refined taste . Now , let us look upon another picture : A fcetid , sickening odour fills the air ; shrieks and moans of agony salute you ; the gutters run full of blood , but you must enter . A raging bull , with his frenzied eye glaring upon his murderers , is dragged up with horrid bellowings ; a dull blow falls upon his skull , and the blood gushes from his throat . The strong , honest ox , who has toiled all his life for man , is murdered . The timid sheep , with painful bleatings , now feels the knife at its throat , and gasps away its innocent life . Calves ,  | torn from their mothers , are hung up by their feet , their veins opened , and allowed to slowly bleed to death , that the veal may be white , drained of its blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opened carcases of these , your fellow-creatures , and your friends ? the floor is covered with their blood and entrails . What sense is gratified by such a scene as this ? Is it beautiful to the sight , pleasant to the ear , grateful to the smell , or does it awaken any calm or happy feeling ? If a man wished to take a walk with one he loved , would he go to a garden , or a slaughter-house ? If he wished to send her a present , would it be a basket of fruit , or a string of sausages ? Man loves the vegetable world , and finds it full of beauty , and attraction , and gratification , because it is his . His nature is adapted to it ; it is adapted to all his wants , and all his natural desires . It is not so with carnivorous and carrion animals . What care the lion , or tiger , or wolf , or hyena , or buzzard , for orange groves and fig trees , orchards and vines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter stores ? Flesh-eating physiologists and physicians have contended for the necessity , if not the beauty , of eating animal food ; but all experience , all science , and all philosophy , are arrayed against them . At this moment , and in all past time , nine-tenths of the whole human race have lived on a vegetable diet , either eating no flesh or making it the rare exception . The great mass of the labour of the world is done on a vegetable diet . In Japan , China , the whole East Indies , Persia , Turkey , all Europe , save the L a-coasts , all Africa , and Central America , flesh is seldom or never eaten by the poor , and over much of this territory , not even by the rich . The finest for. : , L'ne ' oest teetn , the strongest muscles , the .. , ost active limbs in the world , are faa  | on a purely vegetable diet ; while with regard to intellectual and moral development , it is a curious and interesting fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet of ancient or modern times who has not given his testimony , either in his opinions or his practice , in favour of a vegetarian diet . Those who have any doubt on this subject , will do well to examine it fully . In the Chemistry of Man , I have shown that not only are all the elements which are needed by the blood , and which enter into the human organism , found in vegetables ; not only the ultimate elements , as carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , but the proximate elements , as albumen , fibrin , and fatty matter . And these elements are there in great abundance , and in great purity ; in many cases in just the proportions in which they are needed , and free from all taint of disease . This is never the case with flesh used as food . The nutritive matters it contains are in wrong proportions , and always mixed with the excrementitious matters passing out of the animal system , and often with the matter of disease ; for there are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , by being deprived of the conditions of health . Thus the flesh of the healthiest animal contains much waste and poisonous matter ; while thousands of those eaten every day are one mass of disease . The details on this point are too disgusting to be written . We have only to read in the journals of the quantity of diseased and putrefying flesh condemned by the inspectors . Fruit and the farinacea are the natural , and , there , fore , the most healthy food for man . They are best fitted to sustain him in vigour of body and mind . They preserve him in health , and enable him to recover from disease . They contain all the elements he requires in the best proportions and in the best condition . A vegetarian diet is preeminently the diet  | of beauty , energy , activity , and enjoyment . It is the best at all ages , in all conditions , in all employments . It is the best for the labourer , as for the philosopher , the artist , the professional man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable diet , the skin grows clear , the cheeks rosy , the eyes bright , all senses acute , the wits sharp , the intellect vigorous , the feelings deep and pure , the digestion good , all functions regular , the passions under control , the temper calm , the intuitive perceptions quickened , and the whole being exalted into a new , more vigorous , and more beautiful life . The diet most consistent with health , is one composed of the best ripe fruits , as strawberries , raspberries , whortleberries , peaches , pears , apples , grapes , melons , tomatoes , oranges , bananas , figs , dates ; wheat , Indian corn , rice , oatmeal , rye , barley ; peas , beans , lentils , asparagus , potatoes , beets , turnips , squash , cabbage , salsify , egg-plant , etc. , etc . There is a vast variety , of which hundreds of the most exquisite dishes may be made . If we add two articles from the anima kingdom , procured without destruction of life , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our list , if not complete , is sufficient for every reasonable desire ? I mean milk and eggs . These furnish us with a concentrated aliment of agreeable flavour , and they mingle harmoniously with most vegetable substances . The quantity of food , many persons say , who wish to gratify perverted tastes , is of more importance than quality . Each has its own special importance ; but when a man eats food of the proper quality , he is not so apt to err in quantity , and his errors are not so mischievous . It is surely worse to eat too much of a bad thing , than too much of a good thing . A man is much more apt to kill himself with brandy than with potatoes . Vegetarian gluttons exist , doubtless , especially among . hose who have become diseased on  | other modes of diet ; but they are not so common , I imagine , as among " riotous eaters of flesh . " The proper quantity of food for a mature healthy person should include about twelve ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than one pound of farinaceous food , two pounds of potatoes , and what are called vegetables , and a still larger quantity of fruit . Food may be taken , in early infancy , every two or three hours ; and the frequency should be gradually diminished , until , at a year old , the child takes but three meals a day . For the adult , three meals , at intervals of six hours , seems a natural arrangement , though many persons advocate eating but two meals a day . The last meal , when three are eaten , should be lightest in quantity , and most easy of digestion . The rules for eating are much like those of other functions . Hunger is nature 's call for food , and supply should be governed by demand . We should never , when in health , eat but when we are hungry , nor drink but when we are thirsty . We should masticate thoroughly , which insures a proper insalivation . Even when the food is so soft as not to really require chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with saliva . If the food be simple and pure , not too much sweetened or salted , nor prepared with exciting condiments , the sense of hunger is soon overcome , appetite is satisfied , and we feel that we have eaten enough . We should never eat when fatigued , nor in any way exhausted ; nor should we commence violent labour , bodily or mental , nor take a bath , immediately after eating . In the first case we prevent , in the second we interrupt , digestion . We want a large portion of our strength for digestion , and a good digestion gives us strength for every other purpose . Moderate exercise and pleasant mental excitement , as conversation or some amusement , rather favour the digestive process .  | Salt , if necessary at all , which recent experiments lead us to doubt , should be taken in great moderation . Vinegar , lemon juice , or such mild vegetable acid , though not necessary , may be added to some vegetables without apparent injury . Sugar is a concentrated form of nutriment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like salt and vinegar , the power of preserving other substances not only from fermentation out of the stomach , but from digestion in it . Thus , fruit preserves are very hard of digestion , and must be eaten with great caution . Pepper , spices , mustard , and all heating and stimulating sauces , should be used very sparingly , if at all . Greasy food , melted butter , and pastry , are of difficult digestion . Hot drinks debilitate the stomach , as the hot bath does the skin . Tea and coffee , like tobacco and ardent spirits , are narcotic poisons , which , for a time , stimulate , but finally weaken and destroy the nervous system . The best drink is pure , soft , cold water . The nutriment in food should be mixed with a certain proportion of innutritious matter . In all fruits there is a proportion of woody fibre ; also in roots , and in the bran of wheat and corn , and the skins and shells of other vegetables . The most perfect farinaceous food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men can live very well on ten or twelve ounces of wheat a-day , with water for drink . Less wheat , with a portion of fruit , however , is better . Coarse wheat bread , or porridge , fruit , a little milk , make a beautiful and excellent diet . Maize is nearly as good as wheat ? it may be even better for some constitutions . With it we can better do without milk or its products . I add some tables , taken from standard authorities , which embody many important facts on diet . It is to be borne in mind that this system of living , besides being the most natural , the purest , the most beautiful ,  | the healthiest , and the best , is also far the cheapest . No article of food costs so much , in soil , and labour , and care , as flesh . The corn given to a hog to fatten him , would feed a man more than ten times as long as the pork into which it is converted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table presents the numbers expressing the composition of the principal kinds of food made use of , as well as that of flesh ; thus affording a comparison of the nutriment of each article of vegetarian diet , with that of the flesh of animals . The conclusions of this table are from the results of analyses by Playfair , and other chemists of established repute ; and the separation of their parts of nutriment into flesh-forming principle , heat-forming principle , and ashes , is in relation to the necessary elements of food suited to the wants of the body , according to the views of the modern school of Chemistry , after Liebig . Table  | The only direct evidence upon the digestibility of food in the human stomach , of indisputable import , is that published by Dr. Beaumont as the result of his observations in the case of Alexis St. Martin . The few following statements , expressing the digestibility of various articles of ordinary consumption in hours and minutes , are abstracted from the tables containing the results of his carefully conducted experiments : Table In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playfair stated , some years ago , at Drayton Manor , the residence of Sir Robert Peel , at a meeting of a great many distinguished men , that , " at London prices , a man may lay a pound of flesh on his body with milk for 3s. , with turnips at 2S. 9d. , with potatoes , carrots , butchers ' meat without fat or bone , at 2s. , with oatmeal at Is. sod. , with bread , flour , and barley-meal , at Is. 2d. , and with beans at less than 6d . " It is calculated that fifteen persons may live on vegetable food , on the same land that would supply one with flesh . Some English estimates are more remarkable . Twelve acres are required to feed a man with beef alone ; but on potatoes alone , he can live on the produce of one-ninth of an acre . Potatoes alone do not constitute a good diet , but millions have lived very well on potatoes and buttermilk . These facts throw a flood of light on the population question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , under thorough culture , could sustain one hundred millions of inhabitants . Now , a large part of the soil is wasted on cattle and game . Another English estimate is given in the following table , which has many points of interest : Table " Adam Smith , in his Wealth of Nations , informs us : That the most beautiful women in the British dominions , are said to be , the greater part of them , from the lower ranks of the people of Ireland , who are generally fed with potatoes . The peasantry of Lancashire and Cheshire , also , who live principally on potatoes and buttermilk , are celebrated as the handsomest race in England . ' " The peasantry of Wales , Norway , Sweden , Russia , Denmark , Poland , Germany , Turkey , Greece , Switzerland , Spain , Portugal , and almost every country in Europe , from the most northern part of Russia to the Straits of Gibraltar , subsist principally , and most of them entirely , on vegetable food . The Persians , Hindoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants of East Indian Archipelago , of the mountains of Himalaya , and , in fact , most of the Asiatics , live upon vegetable productions . The great body of the ancient Egyptians and Persians confined themselves to a vegetable diet ; and the Egyptians of the present day , as well as the Negroes ( whose great bodily powers are well known ) , live chiefly on vegetable substances . The brave Spartans , who for muscular power , physical energy , and ability to endure hardships , perhaps stand unequalled in the history of nations , were Vegetarians . The departure from their simple diet was soon followed by their decline . The armies of Greece and Rome , m the times of their unparalleled conquests , subsisted on vegetable productions . In the training for the public games in Greece , where muscular strength was to be exhibited in all its varied forms , vegetable food was adhered to , but when flesh-meat was adopted afterward , those hitherto athletic men became sluggish and stupid . From two-thirds to three-fourths of the whole human family , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have subsisted entirely , or nearly so , on vegetable food , and always , when their alimentary supplies of this kind have been abundant , and of good quality , and their habits have been , in other respects , correct , they have been well nourished and well sustained in all the physiological interests of their nature . ' " LINN1Eus , one of the most celebrated naturalists that ever lived , speaking of fruits , says : This species of food is that which is most suitable to man ; which is evinced by the series of quadrupeds , analogy , wild men , the structure of the mouth , of the stomach , and the hands . ' M. DAUBENTON , the associate of Buffon , observes : It is , then , highly probable that man , in a state of pure nature , living in a confined society , and in a genial climate , where the earth required but little culture to produce its fruits , did subsist upon these ,  | without seeking to prey upon animals . ' GASSENDI , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat , that from the primeval and spotless institution of our nature , the teeth were destined to the mastication , not of flesh , but of fruits . ' Sir EVERARD HOME says : While mankind remained in a state of innocence , there is ground to believe that their only food was the produce of the vegetable kingdom . ' BARON CUVIER , whose knowledge of comparative anatomy was profound , and whose opinion , therefore , is entitled to the greatest respect , thus writes : Fruits , roots , and the succulent parts of vegetables , appear to be the natural food of man ; his hands afford him a facility in gathering them ; and his short , canine teeth , not passing beyond the common line of the others , and the tubercular teeth , would not permit him either to feed on herbage , or devour flesh , unless these aliments were previously prepared by the culinary processes . ' RAY , the celebrated botanist , asserts : Certainly , man by nature was never made to be a carnivorous animal , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jagged and pointed teeth , and crooked claws , sharpened to rend and tear ; but with gentle hands to gather fruits and vegetables , and with teeth to chew and eat them . ' Professor LAWRENCE observes : ' The teeth of man have not the slightest resemblance to those of carnivorous animals , except that their enamel is confined to their external surface . He possesses , indeed , teeth called canine ; but they do not exceed the level of the others , and are obviously unsuited to the purposes which the corresponding teeth execute in carnivorous animals . * * * Thus we find , that whether we consider the teeth and jaws , or the immediate instruments of digestion , the human structure closely resembles that of the simix , all of which , in their natural state , are completely frugivorous . ' Lord MONBODDO says : Though I think that man has ,  | from nature , the capacity of living either by prey or upon the fruits of the earth , it appears to me , that by nature , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he only becomes an animal of prey by acquired habit . ' Mr. THOMAS BELL observes : The opinion which I venture to give has not been hastily formed , nor without what appears to me sufficient grounds . It is , I think , not going too far to say , that every fact connected with the human organisation goes to prove that man was originally formed a frugivorous animal , and therefore tropical , or nearly so , with regard to his geographical position . This opinion is principally derived from the formation of his teeth and digestive organs , as well as from the character of his skin , and the general structure of his limbs . ' " The natural drink ? really the only drink of man ? is water . Every mixture with it is of food or drugs . Wine , beer , etc. , are alcohol , sugar , fruit , juices , etc. , and water ; but the water is the drink . The purer the water , the freer from animal , vegetable , and mineral admixture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water better than soft . The water of Malvern is the purest and softest in England , and the most delicious . But there is no part of this country in which an abundant supply of pure soft water may not be had for drinking and culinary uses , by having proper cisterns . They should be large , tight , and built , if possible , of flat stones ; but they may be made of brick , covered with cement . The water should pass into them through a filter , made of alternate layers of fine sand and charcoal , which may be renewed once a-year . No lead should be used about a cistern , as rain-water dissolves it , while spring or river water generally does not . The pipes should be wood , tin , or gutta percha . There is one cistern in Constantinople capable of supplying that vast city with water for  | sixty days . Perfectly soft and pure water may be obtained everywhere from hard or soft water , by distillation . All that is needed is a small still of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a tinned worm . Set over the kitchen fire , it will supply all the water for a family . The first water that passes over should be thrown away , and also the dregs . The water of the Malvern hills is simply rain water filtered through a pure vegetable loam , sand , and gravel . Another condition of health is pure air . We can go for clays without food , but not an hour without air . Respiration is the first act of independent life . We eat and digest at intervals , but we breathe continually . The stomach rests , but never the lungs . We need food every day , though not absolutely ; but we must have air every minute . Air , then , of some kind , is a very vital necessity ; and pure air , and plenty of it , is necessary to health . The atmosphere is the great reservoir from which is obtained the most important materials of the organic world . It is a mixture of about four-fifths of nitrogen , one-fifth oxygen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of the nitrate of ammonia , and traces of phosphuretted and sulphuretted hydrogen . It also holds in solution a large quantity of water in vapour , which we see condensed into clouds , fog , dew , rain , etc . The atmosphere also contains and hears about odours of vegetables , and other aromal qualities , healthy and noxious . Of the latter are the miasms of intermittent and other forms of fever , and certain contagious diseases . The relations of the atmosphere to man are various and important . Through the vegetable world it gives him food ; it is the vehicle of sound ; its weight or pressure is adapted to his organism ; and he uses it in many mechanical appliances . But its gre it vital relation is to the blood , upon which it acts in the  | lungs , and through the skin . The whole mass of the blood is constantly passing through the lungs , and so air is constantly brought into contact with the blood , in which it effects changes so important that life can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be freed from its carbonic acid , or it soon clogs and poisons the system . At every inspiration we take in many cubic inches of air . I have inhaled three hundred and twenty-five cubic inches at a single inspiration . Ordinarily , it is said , we inhale about seventeen cubic inches . When this air is expired , it contains less oxygen , more carbonic acid , and also various impure matters from the body . Some persons ' breaths are terribly diseased , and this is often the case with flesh-eaters , and those who do not bathe , while the breaths of vegetarians and water-cure people are often as sweet as the breath of cows , and so are those of all perfectly healthy persons . If a man is shut in a close room , every breath he breathes changes the quality of the atmosphere . Minute by minute it grows impure . It loses oxygen , becomes loaded with carbonic acid , and filled with excretory emanations both from the lungs and the skin . Put many persons in the room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , steamboat , church , theatre , or concert-room , unless the greatest care is taken to ventilate them , by carrying off the foul air and admitting the pure , the atmosphere becomes totally unfit for respiration . It is debilitating from its want of oxygen , deadly from its carbonic acid , and poisonous from the filthy emanations of people filled with all sorts of diseases . A pure air , then , is of absolute necessity to the blood . We must have quantity as well as quality . If respiration is impeded in any way , it is a cause of disease . The chest should be dilated to its utmost compass . It must never be cramped by a stooping  | attitude . Every muscle of respiration must act with freedom . Neither the ribs , nor the muscles of the chest , nor the diaphragm , nor the muscles of the abdomen , which are the chief agents in expiration , should be in the least impeded by any dress or ligature . By day and by night , at all times and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure air , and breathe it plentifully . Of miasms , and other deleterious qualities to be avoided , I shall speak further on when treating of the causes of disease . The principles and modes of ventilation are very simple . Whenever the air in a room is warmer than the outer air , a crevice , ever so narrow , at the top of a window , will ensure a rapid change . Two currents are instantly formed ? an upper one of warm air leaving the room , and a lower one of fresh air taking its place . Fresh air must also come into every room to take the place of the air which goes up the chimney . But in every house , in cold weather , the air for every room should be warmed before it comes into the rooms , which could easily be done by proper furnaces . Next to food and air , as conditions of health , comes exercise . I use this word here in a wide sense . By it I mean the activity of all voluntary functions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon it for the integrity of their life . As development of every organ is necessary to the harmony of the system ? that is , to health ? and as exercise is necessary to development , it follows that exercise is one of the most important conditions of health . Nature provides us air and food . These a man may have in isolation . Robinson Crusoe , on his desert island , could breathe the purest air , and live upon the most delicious fruits ; he could take all need-  | ful bodily exercises , and could find use for some of his mental powers in the study of nature . But he had no exercise for the higher passions of the soul . These demand society . On the exercise of these , all the most exquisite enjoyments of his life depend . A man must have the exercise of benevolence , of friendship , of ambition , of familism , of love . To have these , he must have society , extensive and varied enough to gratify all these passions in all their various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies in isolation . And as the soul suffers , the body also becomes weak and diseased . Our muscles become wearied with inaction ; we long to use them , but by long disuse , they at last lose their power . So of the passions . We long to love and to be loved ; we long for the sweet accords of friendship , and the inspiring stimulus of ambition ; these longings are the weariness and ennui of the soul . Those who do not know their own natures , feel vague yearnings ; those who have studied them more carefully , have more definite desires . These longings of the soul must be satisfied , or we can have no spiritual health , and the body reflects the soul . In the world , as it is , all exercise , and , consequently , all development , is fragmentary . The blacksmith and the boatman have large arms , the dancer has fine legs , the musician is all tune , the painter all form and colour , an artist is nothing but an artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion is a mere dandy . There is no complete human being anywhere . There is sharpness , and even force , in particular directions , but no integral development and universality of power . Where is the man who is all he should be in himself and in his relations to God , and nature , and society ? Where is the woman , strong , beautiful , self-centred , brave , religious , honest , kind , friendly , loving , wise , accomplished , with a true pride , and a noble ambition ;  | strengthening the weak , guiding the erring , animating the despairing , the life and soul of her sphere ; great , and generous , and free ? In this word exercise lies the whole idea of education . A perfect analogy or harmony of action belongs to the whole system of animal organs , soul and body . Exercise gives both strength and facility of action . When we first sit down to the pianoforte how weak and bungling are our efforts to play . Day after day we accustom our fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Day by day it becomes easier to do so , and we soon learn to play rapidly , with ease , force , and expression , and without the least effort . The habit is formed . It is the same with every faculty and every passion . Every portion of the brain is susceptible of education , of gaining strength and facility by exercise , of forming good habits . Goodness is as habitual to the good as wickedness is to the wicked . It is as easy for men to be habitually brave , generous , noble , and just , as to be craven , stingy , mean , and dishonest . Men 's hereditary character comes from the education of their ancestry ; and in time it may be changed by the same agencies . What men and women need for health are varied employments and amusements , attractive industry , pleasant society , the exercise and satisfaction of varied tastes , talents , and ambitions . All that can give happiness to man , promotes his health ; all that can give health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based upon the simplest laws . " Evils to man , and evils to man only , are sins against God . " God can ask nothing of man but what is for his happiness ; whatever promotes the happiness of man is therefore , pleasing to God . " Therefore , whether ye eat , or drink , or whatever ye do , do all to the glory of God . " Health demands , as its necessary conditions , then ,  | such parentage , birth , and blood , as shall secure a good , sound , well-developed constitution ? " a sound mind in a sound body . " It demands a pure and natural nutrition , or the observance of the laws of diet . It demands a pure air , or an observance of the laws of respiration . It demands the regular performance of all the organic and animal functions , secretions , excretions , and all muscular , nervous , intellectual , moral , and passional activities , which I have included in the law of exercise , It demands for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its functions are not well performed . It demands a temperature neither so warm as to debilitate , nor so cold as to chill and stupefy ; and for this purpose the clothing must be such as comfort requires , without impeding motion , aeration , or perspiration . Dress , with many persons , and with all who are truly developed , is an art and a passion . Aside from comfort in regard to temperature ; aside from its protection of our personality from those we have no sympathy with , and whose sight of our naked forms would be a profanation , dress is a mode of the expression of our sense of the becoming , the harmonious , and the beauti ful , in texture , form , and colour . It is a language , a mode of life , a genuine out-growth of our natures , and is , therefore , -a true necessity and a great enjoyment . Dress is , with many persons , a condition of health or a cause of disease . I do not speak of the vulgarities of tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping the streets and crushing the spine ; but of dress as beautiful or ugly , becoming or incongruous , harmonious or discordant . Be sure that an ugly , ill-fitting dress is a real cause of disease , and that a beautiful dress is both a cause and an indication of health . The first quality of clothing is its cleanliness , the second is its comfort , the third is its fitness to our  | , rrn , age , employment , and condition ; the fourth is its beauty and spiritual harmony . The dress becomes a part of our being . Rest , and especially the rest of sleep , is a condition of health . The animal organs demand rest and res toration . Recreation from a change of employments and enjoyments is not enough . There must be absolute repose . The whole brain must rest , probably from a necessity connected with its nutrition . Nothing exhausts and prostrates us sooner than the want of sleep . Sound sleep is the sign as well as condition of health . The infant , when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearied , sleeps nearly all the time . In childhood and youth we sleep ten or twelve hours of the twenty-four . In maturity we find eight hours sufficient , and in old age we do with less . Sleep is full or partial , and in partial sleep we have strange combinations of memory and fancy , and sometimes of our higher powers of thought and intuition . In these dreams also , and visions of the night , when the senses are locked up in a semblance of death , our souls seem to be opened to the influences of higher states of being . Sleep is made unhealthy by indigestion , bodily weariness , mental excitement , or inquietude , by disordered passions and unsatisfied desires ; by bad air , too much or too little clothing , by that which shuts in perspiration , by a bed too hard or soft , and by all unnatural conditions . As we spend , at least , one-third of our lives in sleep , we may as well take a little care how we sleep , and who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we sleep with a healthy and congenial person , if with any . We must sleep with those we love , and not with those we hate , or who are in any degree repulsive to us . We must not sleep with those who are diseased , unless we are willing to give them  | our strength . The young must not sleep with the aged ; it is too great a draft on their vitality . Children may sleep with the strong and mature , for there is a reciprocation of benefits . We radiate our lives , and partake of the radiations of others ; but if we give much , and get little , we must be the losers . Men have a natural and proper repugnance to sleeping with each other , and so have many women , but not so much . In natural philosophy , like electricities repel , unlike attract . Physiology , or the science of nature , teaches us the conditions of health for every organised being . " Follow nature , " was the true maxim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it contains all , and all that I have written , or could write in a thousand ages , on health or disease , would be but an amplification and illustration of this apothegm . THE CAUSES OF DISEASE . DISEASE , in the sense in which I shall use it , as including also disorder , is the opposite , or the lack of health . It is " Any deviation from health , in function or structure , the cause of pain or uneasiness , distemper , malady , sickness , disorder , any state of a living body in which the natural functions of the organs are interrupted or disturbed , either by defective or preternatural action , without a disrupture of parts by violence , which is called a wound . The first effect of a disease is uneasiness or pain , and the ultimate effect is death . A disease may affect the whole body , or a particular limb or part of the body . We say a diseased limb , a  | disease of the head or stomach , and such partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . " But the system is so bound up in common relations of sympathy , that no disease can be entirely local . The prick of the finest needle affects the whole system ; and a very slight wound may bring on death by lockjaw . If there is any want of harmony in body or mind , it is disease . If there is inaction of any function , irregularity , excess , or any kind of discordance , it is a disease . And as the great sign and result of health is pleasure or happiness , so the great symptom and effect of disease is pain or misery . And as we have pleasure in all degrees , from the simplest feeling of satisfaction to the keenest ecstasy , so we have all degrees of pain , from uneasiness to agony . Diseases are divided by pathologists into general and local ; but as there is no local disease which does not affect the whole system , so it is believed by many that there is no so-called general disease which has not some special locality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ , either on account of its weakness , its excited condition , or some peculiar aptitude to receive it . Thus we have fevers , which are considered general diseases of the nervous system or the circulation , becoming brain fevers , lung fevers , bilious fevers , etc. , according to the organ most affected . Diseases are also divided into functional and organic . They are called organic , when some injury to , or alteration of the organ is perceptible ; and functional , when it is not . Where there is organic disease , there must always be functional ; where there is functional , there must be organic disease somewhere , though not necessarily in the part which appears to be affected . It may be in the nervous centres connected with it . Thus asthma may be an affection of the spinal cord ; and irregular action of the heart , in most cases , comes from  | some nervous connection with the stomach or generative organs . Diseases are called sporadic , endemic , and epidemic ; sporadic , when they appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant occurrence from local causes ; epidemic , when numbers of cases arise in the same district from some causes of temporary occurrence . Diseases are acute , when recent and violent ; chronic , when of long continuance , and slower progress ; mild , when most cases recover ; and malignant , when a large proportion are fatal ; contagious , when they spread in any manner by the influence of the sick upon the well ; otherwise , non-contagious . Highly contagious diseases are called virulent . Disease , in any part , may be characterised by increase , or diminution , or irregularity of function , or some morbid change in its results . Thus , in the bowels there may be diarrhoea , or constipation , or each in alternation , or unnatural excretions ; and the same of other organs . The heart may act with exces. sive force and rapidity ; or it may be weak and rapid , or weak and slow , or irregular . In inflammation there is preternatural heat , swelling , redness , pain . These symptoms , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever . Inflammation is a local fever ; fever , a general inflammation . Medical books are filled with the names of vast numbers of diseases , as a precisely similar affection of each organ of the body receives a corresponding name . Thus we have encephalitis , meningitis , arachnitis , parotitis , otitis , iritis , glossitis , pharyngitis , laryngitis , tracheitis , bronchitis , pleuritic , pericarditis , carditis , gastritis , enteritis , peritonitis , hepatitis , nephritis , cystitis , etc. , etc. , and all these hard words ending in ITIS , mean simply an inflammation of the brain , its membranes , the parotid gland , ear , tongue ,  | throat , etc . The laws of one of these affections govern all . Everywhere we have nearly the same phenomena , the same causes , and similar modes of treatment . All disease is attended by a lack of nervous energy , or the presence of morbid matter in the system , or both combined . In either case it may be hereditary or acquired , general or local , acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease will best explain its nature ; and by these we are directed to the means of cure . The cause of a disease is , in many cases , scarcely to be separated in idea from the disease itself . Perhaps the word disease is applied more strictly to the phenomena which this cause produces , or to the efforts of the system to work against , overcome , or cast out the cause . If the system sank quietly and unresistingly under every cause of disease , we should scarcely know what sickness is . The pain and action of disease are the outcries and efforts of nature for relief . A primary cause of disease is a hereditary lack of vitality . In such cases there may be early abortion , miscarriage , still-birth , death in infancy , marasmus , or lack of nutrition , rickets , convulsions , hydrocephalus , difficult dentition , and all the effects of general debility . There is the hereditary taint of scrofula , producing imperfect development , diseases of the skin , tubercular disease of the glandular system , tubercle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tabes mesenterica , white swelling , hip disease , and the whole train of scrofulous disorders . Other diseases are also hereditary , caused by the transmission of morbid matters , as gout , psora , salt rheum , syphilis , insanity . A bad atmosphere , the crowd-poison of large towns and cities , produces cholera infantum , typhus , and lung diseases . Wherever people are crowded together , without cleanliness , the air becomes pestiferous . Infants  | die , all are debilitated ; and when some other cause of disease is added , some miasm or contagion , these people are the victims . They die of typhus , or cholera , or dysentery ; and are continually dying prematurely of consumption . Diseased food ? as the flesh of diseased animals ; the milk of distillery fed cows ; fish and flesh in the process of putrefaction ; sausages , made of offensive materials ; measley pork ; narcotic and stimulating drinks ; beer and porter , made worse by drugs ; tobacco ? these are all prolific causes of disease . Uncleanly habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tend to clog the pores , prevent the throwing out of effete , waste , and morbid matters , and cause the re-absoption of matters already expelled , and are fruitful causes of disease . As all the functions of life are carried on by the nervous energy , a loss of that is not only a direct cause of functional debility , but by diminished vigour of excretion , it prevents the waste matter being carried out of the system ; and this matter , thus retained , acts as a poison , and is a cause of almost every kind of disease . This reacts again ; exhaustion causes impurity , and impurity produces exhaustion . Consequently , anything which exhausts the power of the organic and animal system ? anything which destroys the nervous energy , is in many ways a cause of disease . Intense labour , care , and anxiety , protracted watchings , domestic unhappiness , any source of grief , may exhaust the nervous energy , and be a cause of disease . Sedentary employments , or monotonous labours , overtasking one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same effect . The undue , and , therefore , disordered activity of any passion or appetite , is a cause of disease , by turning aside or exhausting the nervous energy that should be  | given to the whole system . Inordinate eating and drinking , avarice , ambition , all single and excessive passions , destroy the equilibrium of the system . But there is no passion so exhausting as amativeness . Its abuses are in proportion to its uses . The nervous exhaustion from its excess is the cause of most cases of dyspepsia , rheumatism , consumption , palsy , epilepsy , apoplexy , the nervous and uterine diseases of women , and , in fact a large proportion of all the diseases of mankind . The abuse of amativeness , which sometimes begins in childhood , and even in infancy , rapidly exhausts the nervous power . The generative function takes strength from the organic and the animal powers . The stomach can not digest , for want of the nervous energy so wasted . Nutrition can not be carried on in the capillary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by the secreting and excreting organs , is retained to poison the fountains of life ; the skin becomes dry and withered ; the eye dull ; the mind weak and disordered ; all noble feelings lose their force ; the whole system falls into weakness and disorder ; and then comes spinal disease , palsy , or some form of consumption . Self-pollution in boys leads to involuntary seminal emissions , which , if frequent , are a serious disease , and continual cause of nervous exhaustion and impotence . In girls the same habit causes leucornccea , whites , irregular , profuse , and painful menstruation , falling of the womb , a loss of all pleasure in the sexual relation , difficult and painful childbirth , and a whole train of nervous and hysterical affections , which make the lives of women a burden to themselves and to all around them . Amative excesses , even in mature age , and under lawful conditions , produce exhaustion , and so cause disease . Good , pious , loving husbands and wives kill each other with kindness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-lived , suffering children . In monotonous absorption in each other , they destroy each other ; each , perhaps , falsely imagining that the other demands such murderous excess . Alas l how many stones can be seen in every church-yard , marking the graves of such husbands , and especially such wives , who add to these continuous excesses of ama tiveness , the exhaustion of gestation and childbirth . Such women marry at fifteen or twenty , and die before they are thirty-five . The exhaustion of unnatural , or disordered , or excessive amativeness leads to cravings for stimulants . Men resort to tea , coffee , brandy , tobacco ; they crave the richest and most stimulating food . These , in turn , provoke the action of the generative organs , and so the mischief goes on , until poor nature sinks in utter exhaustion ; some disease sets in , and death relieves the sufferer from a body he has so much abused . The stimulants I have just mentioned , whether taken to relieve this or any other debility , are all exhausting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating effects , and they are also poisons , which are retained in the system , acting upon the nerves , and a direct cause of disease . The concentrated extracts of tea , coffee , and tobacco , will kill small animals like so much prussic acid . Tobacco is one of the most insidious and debilitating of narcotics , stupefying and gradually weakening the nervous system . When used by the young its tendency is to stupefy the brain and bring on early impotence . The craving for flesh , on account of its stimulating qualities , is another result of nervous exhaustion . A flesh diet is exciting , feverish , inflammatory , as well as impure , and often poisonous . Flesh , after long disuse , intoxicates like brandy . It has been found , by experiment , that chyle made of flesh putrefies in much less time than that made from vegetable sub .  | stances , and the same is notably the case with the blood . Flesh-eaters are especially subject to inflammatory diseases , particularly fevers and dysentery . A vegetable diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be considered an absolutely certain safeguard against fevers , bowel complaints , cholera , small pox , and similar diseases . The poisonous nature of animal matters in process of decomposition is shown by the following experiment of Magendie : " If we introduce into the jugular vein of a dog a few drops of water which has remained a little time in contact with animal substances in a state of putrefaction , in the course of an hour after the introduction , the animal will be depressed and lie down . Soon he will be attacked with an ardent fever ; will vomit black and foetid matter ; his alvine evacuations will be similar ; the blood will have lost its power of coagulation , will be extravasated into the tissues , and death will soon follow . " Flesh-eating , giving us an unnatural , excited life , leads to sensuality ; sensuality brings exhaustion ; exhaustion demands stimulation ; and so the work of destruction goes on . Dress may be a cause of disease , and an aggravation of other causes . Too much clothing weakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The compression of the female waist , by which the action of the diaphragm is destroyed , all the muscles of the respiration weakened , and the lungs , heart , liver , stomach , spleen , and pancreas compressed into one-half the space designed for them , is too evident a source of disease to require a word of comment . Ligatures on any part of the body interfere with the freedom of the circulation ; and tight boots and shoes are a great evil , from this cause , and from the compression of the nerves . Any article of dress that excludes air and light from  | the skin , that prevents the free circulation of the blood , that keeps in , or retains for re-absorption , the matter of perspiration , is a cause of disease . Great mischiefs , therefore , are occasioned by the use of water-proof hats , caps , and boots , and of oil-cloth or india-rubber , worn upon the person . Changes of dress , from thick to thin , and in females , from the high-necked morning-dress to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are causes of disease . Either , worn habitually , might answer . The lighter dress may be really the best ; but when the skin has been weakened , and made sensitive , it will not bear these sudden changes . Chill , from any cause , unless it is succeeded by immediate re-action and warmth , is a cause of disease . The sudden constriction of the skin by cold suspends its action ; the matter it was expelling is thrown upon the mucous membrane in the throat , lungs , or bowels , and we have the feverish excitement and increased and morbid secretions which we call a cold , catarrh , diarrhoea , etc . Fresh and pure air is a necessary of healthy life , but a current of cold air when we are too weak to resist it , causes a sudden closing of the pores , and often leads to serious disorder . Indolence , or lack of exercise of body or mind , is both an effect and a cause of disease . Laziness is often a real disease ; which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and habitual activity . Attitude may be a cause of disease . Stooping distorts the spine and compresses the lungs , heart , stomach , etc . It interferes , therefore , with innervation , respiration , circulation , digestion , and disturbs , directly or indirectly , all vital processes . This habit is acquired in many monotonous employments ; but a little care and resolution will prevent it , or even cure it where the habit is fully formed . Any crooked person may straighten himself , if he resolutely sets  | about it . Let him stand against the wall and straighten himself a dozen times a-day , continuing the effort at his work , in walking , and even in bed , and he will soon be as straight as a sapling . Any constrained and unnatural attitude may be a cause of disease . Lack of light is a cause of disease in vegetables and animals . Light is the source of life ; darkness is the synonym of death . All dark places are full of disease . Fashion , which turns day into night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghostly glare of gas and candles for the vital radiance of the sun , makes us look like blanched celery or potato vines growing in a cellar . Light is so absolute a condition of health , that its deprivation is always a cause of disease . Miners , men employed below decks on steamers , those who work in ill-lighted factories and cellars or at night , artists who exclude light from their studios , all suffer from the absence of this most direct expression of the Infinite Life . Occupations are causes of disease , by their exhaustion , their monotony , their deprivation of healthy conditions , their slavery , and the utter hopelessness of improvement . With monotony , desperation , and bad conditions , whole ships ' crews get the scurvy . In similar states , manufacturing populations sink under typhus and consumption . Many employments also introduce morbid matters into the system . Millers , stone-cutters , grinders , cotton-ginners and spinners , mattress-makers , bakers , etc. , are subject to affections of the throat and lungs . Painters , gilders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are poisoned . It is certain death to work in a white-lead factory , or a mine of quicksilver . The manufacturers of some drug poisons , given as medicines , are soon destroyed by their inhalation and absorption . The excessive and subversive actions of the pas . *ions are causes of disease . People die of disappointed  | love and ambition . Anger , grief , and even violent joy produce apoplexy , delirium , hysteria , hemorrhage . Fear acts on the circulation , turns the hair white in a few hours , brings on premature old age , and even kills suddenly . Sorrow , care , anxiety , jealousy , produce the same effects less rapidly . All discord of the passions is disease . Disease of the mind is reflected upon the bodily organs ; and so it is called a.cause of disease , when it is only an extension . Love and its subversions act upon the heart and lungs ; other passions upon the stomach , liver , kidneys , and bowels . Poisons taken into the system by the stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act directly upon the nervous system , are among the most frequent causes of disease . All the waste matter of the body , arising from the action and consequent disintegration , combustion , or destruction of all the tissues , which are continually renewed by nutrition , becomes , if retained in the system , a cause of disease , a real virus , a true poison . This is known to be true of urea , or the solid matter of the urine , the bile , the faecal matter , the matter of perspiration , and the carbon excreted by the lungs . Any interruption of the functions of skin , liver , kidneys , intestines , or lungs , is , therefore , a cause of disease by the retention of morbid matter . Similar matter taken in food , and especially in eating the carcases of dead animals , which always contain it , is a cause of disease . The introduction of a certain quantity of this matter of putrefaction taints the breath , and overtasks all the purifying organs . These poisons may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded atmospheres , and absorbed by contact with uncleanly persons . Plagues , campfevers , jail-fevers , typhus , dysen t Pries - cholera , and many  | other diseases , are either solely caused or greatly aggravated by this animal poison . Of a similar character is the effluvia from graveyards , which poison all around them . Portions of London were formerly pestiferous from this cause . The poison of animal putrefaction is sometimes so virulent , that the slightest inoculation with it , by the prick of a needle , or the cut of a scalpel , produces death . Many surgeons and medical students have died of such inoculations . Tea , coffee , alcohol , opium , tobacco , all stimulants , and all narcotic poisons in habitual use , are causes of disease , both by the stimulation and consequent exhaustion of the nervous system , and by their presence , as morbid or diseasing matters in the system . The system of an old tea or coffee drinker becomes saturated with these infusions . Alcohol fills all the tissues of the inebriate , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion . In the water-cure , we have patients from whom opium and tobacco are thrown out for weeks together , in such quantities as to stain sheets and bandages and poison the atmosphere around them . Closely allied to these , as causes of disease , are the poisonous drugs administered as medicines . And it must not be forgotten that syphilis , scrofula , and probably every kind of blood-poison , can be taken by vaccination , which , so far from being a protection against small-pox , seems to have been one of the chief causes of the late epidemics . It is never safe to take matter from another body into our own . We risk taking all its diseases . There is no doubt that thousands have been mortally poisoned by vaccination , made compulsory by law upon the whole popu. lation . Apparently healthy children have scattered hereditary syphilis , and , perhaps , even worse cLseases.  | Stimulants weaken the parts they excite ; tonics destroy tone ; cathartics produce constipation ; mercury , quinine , arsenic , antimony , and opium , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecking the strongest constitutions . The quack medicines which deluge the country are mischievous just in the ratio of their potency . The sassafras and molasses , which costs sixpence , and is sold for a dollar a bottle as sarsaparilla , can not do much harm , unless it contains , as it commonly does , a minute but effective portion of arsenic or corrosive sublimate . Causes of disease exist in the water we drink . Hard water , containing lime in some of its combinations , or other mineral matter , is totally unfit for drinking , and Is the cause of gravel , stone , goitre , and other morbid growths , and is also a common cause of dyspepsia and bowel complaints . Hard water , that will not wash the skin , nor penetrate and soften food in cooking , is not fit for drink , and scarcely for bathing . Wherever the water of springs or wells is hard , rain water should be caught in large , clean cisterns , and carefully preserved for all domestic uses . Filtered through alternate layers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water we can have . It is even better to take the trouble of distilling water , than to use such as is hard . Water containing vegetable and animal impurities , and animalculae , may introduce morbid matters into the system . Fresh , cold spring water , or clean , wellpreserved rain water , however , contains no animal life . Water , to contain animalculae , must have been exposed to light and warmth , and contain , also , some vegetable or animal matter . Water infiltrated with sewage , and containing decaying animal matter , is a fertile cause of disease . One well , into which filth can percolate , may breed cholera or typhus in a whole district . All doubtful-water should be thoroughly fib tered , or boiled , or both .  | Causes of disease , of more or less potency , are found in the atmosphere , in what is called malaria , which simply means bad air , but is used to designate the unknown cause of many endemic and epidemic diseases . There seems much reason to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , so subtle as not to be influenced by atmospheric changes and motions . Carbonic acid gas , if a poison , is still more a mechanical cause of illness or death . In a well , a mine , or a close room , it displaces the atmosphere , and produces asphyxia , by hindering us from breathing . We drown in this heavy gas , as in water . In each case we die for want of breath . It kills us just as it puts out a candle , by preventing the access of oxygen . A well is freed from it by putting . in quick-lime , which absorbs it in being converted into a carbonate . The means of resuscitation are the same as in drowning , only that cold water may be dashed over the body , while after drowning we try to restore warmth . In a crowded , close room , the oxygen is soon exhausted , and the air filled with carbonic acid , besides much diseased matter . A fashionable singer orders her concert-rooms to be shut close , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath and poisoning . Every one 's health is diminished and their lives shortened . Judges , lawyers , and jurymen , are murdered in the wretchedly ventilated court-rooms of England in the same manner . Clergymen and their congregations are all made sick . In 1756 , one hundred and forty-six Englishmen were confined one night in an East Indian dungeon , called the Black Hole of Calcutta : one hundred and twenty-three ? all but twenty-three ? perished before morning . Nearly a century afterward , seventy-five human beings perished in one night , by being fastened , during a gale , in the close cabin of an English steamer  | The malaria which seems to be the cause of typhus fever , dysentery , camp fever , jail fever , ship fever , yellow fever , appears to be the putrid and poisonous exhalations of either decaying vegetable or animal matter , or of uncleanly and diseased living persons . These diseases are therefore contagious ? that is , each sick person helps to poison the atmosphere that produces or determines the disease . Decaying vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in a cellar on shore , will cause fever . The opening of a drain in certain localities , has caused attacks of cholera in a street which was considered quite healthy . The causes of yellow fever are circumscribed to particular localities . A grove of trees , or even a high fence , is a barrier . A ship with yellow fever , at quarantine , has given the disease to persons residing at the leeward . But whatever the nature of these causes , there seems to be some specific agency which determines the nature of the disease . With the same kind of persons , suffering from the same causes , we have at one time dysentery ; at another , erysipelas ; at another , hospital gangrene ; at another , typhus , or ship , or jail fever ; at another , yellow fever ; at another , cholera . We have also special animal poisons determining to measles , scarlatina , small-pox , etc . We have also the malaria which causes intermittent fever , or fever and ague . This disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deserts , and Is wanting in the most fertile localities . Stagnant water is said to cause it , but we find it on dry prairies , and miss it amid swamps and morasses . Localities which seem to the observer precisely similar , and even but a few miles apart , are entirely different in this respect . Any disturbance of the soil , as digging a canal , or grading a railroad , may bring out the poison . The cause seems to be in the soil , and not in decaying matter , either animal or vegetable . It is not found ou  | certain geological strata , nor above a certain degre of latitude . As we go south it is more intense , and i3 combined with other malaria to produce remittent fevers . The malaria of the Carolina rice swamp , or of the African coast , is almost certain death to a white man from a single night 's exposure . By day the rarefication of the air , or the direct action of the sun , either disperses or neutralises the poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several circumstances . In every community , exposed to the sarne general causes of malaria , contagion , etc. , some are well , some sick , some die . For all this there must be a reason . Those who have the most vitality , the most power of resistance , the least predisposition to disease , who have been born and are living in the most healthy conditions , are proof against outward causes of disease . They pass through plague , yellow fever , cholera , and all ordinary epidemics unharmed . The cholera is a good illustration of this . There can be no doubt that its specific , determining cause was over the whole city of New York , but its victims were among those who were weakened by other causes , and were living in unhealthy conditions . Of the 5,000 who died of cholera in New York in 1849 , 3,000 were buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery . They were mostly poor Irish and Germans , living crowded together , in the most unhealthy parts of the city , and surrounded by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by intemperance , by sensuality , or in some way unable to resist the diseasing influence . There was no danger to any really healthy person . And this is true of most external causes of disease . In proportion to the energy of our vitality and the purity of our lives , is our power to resist and overcome diseasing influences . The rate of mortality from bad water , other filth .  | over-crowding , and similar causes of disease , on the east side of London , is double that on the west , or aristocratic side . From twenty to thirty thousand poor labouring people in London are killed every year by filth alone ; while the number of those who are sick of fever is twelve times as great . In the healthiest parts of London the deaths by cholera were 8 in 1o,000 . In the worst parts , 225 in ro , 000 . Had London been perfectly healthy , there would have been o in ro , 000 . There is another preventive to particular forms of disease , in that power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , which may be called the power of habit or acclimation . Persons get accustomed to the malaria of yellow fever , for instance . Habit enables a man to take twenty grains of opium at a dose ; when he began , five grains would have killed him . Custom enables a man to smoke or chew tobacco all day long ; when he began , a single quid or half a cigar made him deadly sick . It is in this way that men bear so much evil , live in filth , eat flesh , breathe foul air , use tobacco and whisky , and become hardened to all the miseries of life . They are acclimated . But the whisky , and malaria , and pork , and medicine , and domestic broils , and tobacco , are evils none the less , and they kill none the less , because nature has the power of fortifying herself , and making a protracted instead of a violent resistance . For all acute diseases are the strong and rapid efforts of nature to rid us of disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same end . The causes of disease are of two kinds ; weakness , original ; or by exhaustion of the nervous power or vital energy ; and the presence of diseasing matter in the system . The latter may be hereditary , an effect , or even a cause of the former . The presence of a sick person will produce an effect of painful sympathy upopp  | an impressible person . Even a letter coming a thousand miles , will produce on such a person , before it is opened , such pain as the writer may have been suffering . A magnetised ring or a lock of hair gives to some persons a feeling of the mental states and bodily condition of an absent friend . If I lay my hand upon the region of Firmness , Self-esteem , etc. , I give a feeling of strength . By an opposite influence , I produce depression and pain . have known persons to be thrown into convulsions by the simple feeling of the spheres of those about them . The presence of a person of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would restore them . CURATIVE AGENCIES . " PREVENTION iS better than cure . " Even the ratio in which it is better is sometimes set forth ; and we are told that " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . " Doctors find that prevention is in no demand , or that it is too cheap to afford them any profit ; for they do not deal in the article . Quacks advertise their nostrums as preventives of disease , especially when there is some prevailing epidemic . Doctors are generally in favour of vaccination , for they are paid for it ; and if disease , as many believe , is thereby propagated , and even the small-pox but little , if any , diminished , it is a profitable preventive . How can diseases be prevented ? Simply in two ways : by living , as far as possible , in accordance with all the conditions of health ; and by avoiding , in like manner , every cause of disease . By keeping up the  | strength and purity of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion ; and by living so as to keep free from all matter of disease . The cure of disease is not accomplished by any medical system . Nature does her own work . It is the power of life that moulds and builds up the organism ; it is the intelligent soul that first forms the body , and presides over all its processes , which struggles against disease , overcomes it , and casts it out of the system . No device of man can accomplish such a work as this ; and man 's efforts to assist nature have , in most cases , been full of error and mischief . In all cases of disease , when the vital force is sufficient , nature effects a cure . When there is more disease than this vital force can overcome , nature sinks under the effort , and the patient dies ; sometimes after a violent and brief struggle , sometimes after a weak and protracted one . The well-meaning doctor , in many cases , instead of attacking the disease , if , indeed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon nature ; he attacks and weakens the vital energy , using poison and steel against her , bleeding , blistering , and drugging , until he changes the whole aspect of affairs ; and nature , who was strong enough to cope with disease , sinks under the united forces of disease and the doctor . Or it may be a drawn battle ; nature , overpowered by drugs , gives up the struggle , and each party ? nature , disease , and drugs ? occupy the disputed territory , and patch up a peace . But this does not last long . Nature renews the struggle , the doctor renews his mischievous interference ; and life is made a long agony by this intestine war . When nature is left alone to cope with disease , the struggle is brief in proportion to its violence . The matter of disease is cast out by some sharp crisis ? vomiting , diarrhoea , or sweating ? and there is a quick recovery . I believe that a much larger proportion of  | cases in all diseases would recover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we understand the mode of cure adopted by nature , we can see how she may be aided by art . There is an intelligent soul which presides over the bodily organism , as a whole , and in every minutest part . When a bone is broken , or an artery tied , this intelligent power goes to work to repair damages . It is the same in all vital processes . When poison , as tobacco or opium , is taken into the system , there is at first a violent effort to cast it out by vomiting , preceded by nausea , or sickness at the stomach . In case of a failure to vomit , the next process is sweating . In one way or the other , or both , they are expelled , unless in too large a dose , when they overpower life , and cast it out of the body . If poison or diseasing matter is taken into the system in so small quantities as not to call for any violent effort to expel it , it is treated just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are either allowed to go quietly out , by the usual avenues , or are made prisoners . Francke , a German pathologist and hydropathist , has made some curious observations on this point . He says , that in all cases where poison , or morbid matter , is not at once cast out of the system , it is enveloped in a coating of mucus , to prevent it from doing injury , and then either carried out by the usual processes , or , if this can not well be done , it is retained in the system , each atom being thus " slimed up , " and protected from doing more mischief . But as these matters accumulate in the system , there is a constant tendency to drive them out ; and every cold , every fever , every paroxysm of disease is such an effort . The matter is always there , and always liable to be dislodged , and to be the cause of diseased action , or of the effort toward health ; but when nature fails , either from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctors , and the introduction of more poison , she either gives up the struggle finally , and retires from the body altogether , or spends her remaining efforts in again sliming up the materies marbi . Sometimes masses of these slimed-up matters , medicines , and other poisons , are collected along the walls of the stomach and intestines , covering and rendering useless large patches of those organs . Sometimes they appear in the form of tubercle . In this case they have got as far as the glands , the lungs , the areolar tissue , and even to the skin . There are many phenomena in the cure of disease by hydropathy , which give , to say the least , a violent presumption of truth to this hypothesis . But in whatever particular way nature deals with the matter of disease , whether the product of the system or introduced from without , the general fact is well ascertained , that these matters are sometimes cast out at once , and sometimes after a long course of years , during which they remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time to be a cause of disorder , like the aforesaid prisoners in an enemy 's country . We have , in the medical world , five schools of pathology ? the nervous , solidist , the humoral , the chemical , and the mechanical . They believe , respectively , that all diseases arise from irregular nervous action , from disease of tissues , from humors in the blood , from chemical changes , and from animalcular or mechanical irritation . My pathology includes all these theories , and all the facts on which they are founded . Modes of . practice are based on these exclusive theories of disease . The nervists deal in sedatives , anti-spasmodics , and poisons , which directly affect the nervous system ; the solidists rely on mercurial and other alteratives ; the humorists bleed and purge ; the chemists give alkalies and acids ; and the animalculists  | strive to poison the enemy , forgetting , as an old doctor said of worm medicines , that man is but a worm , and is liable to be killed by the same poisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion causes impurity , and impurity produces exhaustion , two things are requisite to a cure . These two should be written in letters of gold ? INVIGORATION and PURIFICATION . Let me make this emphatic by two definitions : Pathology. ? Exhaustion and impurity resulting in disease and death . Therapeutics. ? Invigoration and purification resulting in health and life . In each case a third term is wanting , which belongs to the domain of psychology , or the science of the soul . In pathology it lies back of exhaustion , and in therapeutics its curative agency must precede invigoration . The pathological term I shall call inversion , to express discordance of the soul . It is a condition of ignorance , unbelief , and desperation . The opposite psychical agency is one of insight , hope , faith , and loving confidence in nature and in God . It is a state of concordance or harmonisation . We may express the whole subject in this triple formula : Physiology ? Harmony in the soul ; energy in the vital or nervous power ; urity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pathology ? Inversion in the soul ; exhaustion of vital or nervous energy ; impurity of organism . General disintegration . Therapeutics ? Harmonisation of the soul ; invigoration of the vital or nervous energy ; purification . Integral restoration . The physiological condition is that of health , hat .. mony , and fulness of life . The pathological is one of disease , discordance , and dissolution .  | The therapeutical is one of hope , effort , and restoration . So united are the three terms of each condition , that each one may produce the two others ; or if we can produce two , the third is almost certain to follow . The best or worst results , however , are derived from the concurrence of all three . For instance , harmony in the soul gives energy of vitality and bodily purity . Energy of vitality purifies the body and harmonises the soul . Bodily purity gives energy of life and harmony of feeling . Or , inversion or discord of the soul produces exhaustion and impurity . Exhaustion brings discord and impurity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harmonisation , or faith and hope , gives energy and purity . Invigoration inspires hope , and causes purification ; and a simple bodily purification will go far to produce vigour of life and harmony of the spirit . Here , then , in a few words , and simply stated , is my theory of Health , Disease , and Cure . Let us proceed to its practical application . What agencies can we make use of safely and profitably , to aid nature in her three-fold work of cure ? In the answer to this question lies the basis of all therapeutical science . The first thing we must learn ? the first principle of medicine , and the one oftenest disregarded , is to do no mischief . It is not true that we must do something . Unless we know what to do , it is always safer and better to do notliinh If we are not sure that we can aid nature , we must not run the risk of hindering her with our interference . All experience shows that , in a great majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in spite of mischievous efforts . But the moment any one is taken ill ? that is , the  | moment nature begins the operation of expelling some matter of disease ? everybody wants to be doing something to the patient . Every old woman rushes in with her infallible nostrum , and nature , who has honestly set to work to cure a disease , finds herself hindered on every side . When the stomach is incapable of digestion , it must be deluged with gruels , rice water , and barley water , as if the moment one was taken sick , he was in imminent danger of starvation . Then comes the doctor , and if one of the common sort , the attack begins in earnest . A few years ago out came the lancet , and followed its rude gash a quart of blood . Poor nature , feeling the work she had to do , and needing all her strength , gasped at this murderous sacrifice ; but the next attack was to cover fifty square inches of the skin with a torturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throat doses of the most virulent poisons of the nzateria medlar . This process went on , and when nature finally sunk under the disease , and the added exhaustion of a vile and torturing medication , everybody consoled himself with the idea that " everything was done that could be done ; " it should be added , " to kill the patient . " Napoleon , a man of grand intuitions , once said to the Italian physician , Antonomarchi : " Believe me , we had better leave off all these remedies . Life is a fortress which neither you nor I know anything about . Why throw obstacles in the way of its defence ? Its own means are superior to all the apparatus of your laboratories . Covisart candidly agreed with me that all your filthy mixtures are good for nothing . Medicine is a collection of uncertain prescriptions , the results of which , taken collectively , are more fatal than useful to mankind . Water , air , and cleanliness are the chief articles in my pharmacopoeia . " If medicine were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hone , the surgeon is content to  | put it in its place , prescribe rest , and a moderate diet , and leave nature to mend it . But when it is the liver or lungs that are disordered , the doctor bleeds , and blisters , and doses , gives alterative , cathartic , opiate , and does more mischief in a week than nature can remedy in a year . I have no patience with the folly of patients , or the ignorance , to call it no worse , of physicians . But when I see how the latter are educated , and the former deceived , I can not wonder at the result . I have seen hundreds of medical students ; I have attended the lectures of two medical colleges . " I speak what I know , and testify what I have seen . " What Napoleon said is true of the highest and most enlightened . What , then , must be the truth respecting the great mass of medical practitioners ? But there are th ings that we may do , wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , is the true science of medicine . To do nothing , is better than to do mis. chief ; but it is not so well as to do something that should be done . When a man has fallen into a ditch , we had better do nothing than to jump upon him , and bury him deeper ; but it is much better to carefully pull him out , cleanse him of the mud , put him in the right path , and send him on his way rejoicing . We can do all that is practicable to remove the causes of disease , which must be ascertained by a thorough examination . Patients cheat physicians ant . even themselves , as to the causes of disease . How seldom will a woman confess to tight lacing , or a man to gluttony . We must not expect confessions of secret licentiousness . But we must do all in our power , and admonish the patient as to the existence of hidden causes of evil . There are potent causes of disease that are not easy to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul and body , by a brutal husband ? I beg pardon of all honest brutes , but there is no other word  --  it is not  | so easy to take her away from him , or to send him away from her , and such cases are generally hopeless . The husband may be the only real cause of disease ; and without a separation , there can be no cure . So of many false and oppressive social conditions . Children are oppressed by unsympathising parents ; parents have their lives cursed by perverse children ; vast numbers suffer from relatives on whom they are dependent . Some of the benefits which patients receive at water-cure establishments and other sanitary resorts , come from their having left such causes of disease behind them ; but when they go back , they are too apt to relapse . The common causes of exhaustion may generally be removed , unless they belong to the condition of the patient , such as his necessary avocations , care , trouble , etc. ; or unless the disease itself is of an exhausting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions in men . We may change the diet , or interdict food entirely ; we may remove the patient from bad air , or secure him ventilation ; we may attend to external cleanliness . In short , we may safely and rightly , as far as possible , give to the diseased the conditions of health ; and in this we have done much for his restoration . In this , as in all other things , there is one grand rule of practice : that we adapt our measures to the condition of the patient . " Cease to do evil , learn to do well , " applies to sins bodily as well as sins spiritual . But what is well for the well man is not always well for the invalid . It is well for the well man to eat , drink , take exercise , labour , and partake of all enjoyments . But the best thing for the sick man may be to entirely stop eating , and to rest , mind and body . The effort to digest food , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause of exhaustion . Many patients are injured by long walks , as well as by too much treatment . They are ambitious to cope with  | others in exercise : they want to get their money 's worth of treatment ; exhausted by both , they eat to get strength , and overtask again the digestive powers ; finally they sink under this triple mischief , and go away worse than they came . The hunger-cure , or absolute rest to the stomach , is one of the simplest means of cure , in most acute and dyspeptic diseases . No food , not one atom of any kind , should ever be taken in some cases of acute disease , until they are cured . Starve and drink water is all that is needed for the digestive apparatus . This , with cold water to the skin , for cooling and purification , and cold water injections to the bowels for the same purpose , are the means of cure . And in all chronic diseases , which are dependent upon or complicated with dyspepsia , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . In many cases a patient should resolutely starve , not live on slops , but eat nothing , and drink water for three weeks , taking daily ablutions and injections , and it will go further to secure a cure than months of the most active treatment , when this is neglected . I have seen this tried , and know its efficacy . Vhen the patient begins to eat , it should be the smallest quantity of food , and of the simplest quality ; say one ounce of coarse bread , and two ounces of fruit a-day for the first week ; then two ounces of bread and four of fruit for another week ; then three ounces of bread and six of fruit for a month . By this time the worst dyspeptic will have digestion for meals progressively larger , until he reaches the standard of health , and his whole system will have undergone the most remarkable changes . One of the best cures of dyspepsia I ever heard of was that of Mr. Robinson , of Nantucket , who cured himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , at a meal , three times a-day , drinking nothing but water . Sometimes at slipper he only ate  | half an ounce . He chewed this thoroughly , and persevered in this course for some months . At first he lost flesh , but afterwards gained both flesh and strength , and was soon able to perform the labour of a common working farmer . He was thoroughly cured . I believe the cure would have been still more rapid had he taken the course I have recommended . The world has one great agent of purification , and that is water . It is the universal solvent . Entering largely into the composition of all organic beings , it is by its agency that all vital processes are performed . It is the great agent of digestion , nutrition , and excretion . It is at once the vitaliser and purifier of the world . The matter which is carried out of the system is first dissolved in the watery portion of the blood . Then it passes from the lungs dissolved in vapour , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the intestinal canal in faecal evacuations , which are poured into it through a million sluice-ways , by the agency of water , which is again re-absorbed . When impurities gather upon the surface , we wash them off with water . This single agent , then , in its simplest internal uses , affords us the means of one of the most important conditions of cure , that of purification ; and drinking pure water is alone sufficient in a vast number of cases . Thirst is the call of the intelligent organism for water . It is a common symptom of disease , and especially of all diseases of impurity , rather than exhaustion . Nature commonly knows what she requires . Water is wanted to dissolve the impure matters in the system , and carry them off . The copious drinking of soft water is alone often sufficient to cure a fever . It is followed by profuse sweating , large evacuations of urine , a full action of the bowels ; the system gets a thorough clearing out , and the patient , after recovering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal applications of water , in the cure of disease , axe drinking , and injections by the rectum , and by the vagina . They all , when taken cold , answer the two great purpo : es of cure . They cleanse and invigorate . Injections into the rectum , penetrating , as they may , the entire length of the colon , soften accumulations of faecal matter , and wash them away . In all cases of constipation , or where there is not a full daily action , these injections should be taken to the extent of from one to three pints , retaining them for some minutes , and repeating them as often as needed . Every person liable to sickness should have a good syringe for this purpose . The pump syringe is the best ; but any kind will answer which will inject water into the bowels . There is scarcely any case of disease in which injections once or twice a-day may not be used to advantage . In diarrhoea they are taken cold after every discharge , to wash away corroding excretions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysentery they cleanse , reduce inflammation , stop hemorrhage , and give tone or vigour . Injections of cool or cold water into the vagina , and upon thr uterus by that means , produce the same effects ; +. eansing , checking hemorrhage , and giving energy to die parts . Water , applied externally , also produces all these effects . It purifies , cools , and invigorates every part to which it is applied . Try it on the hand . Try it when it is dirty , dry , hot , and wearied , Dip and rub it a few moments in cold water . It becomes clean , moist , cool , and invigorated . Try it on the whole body , and you will find the same effect . This is a matter so important as to require a little more explanation . Water cleanses by its power of dissolving substances . Water cools by its coming in contact with so many points of surface , and its power of conducting heat ,  | Ind often by evaporation . It cools the whole surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands into cold water will cool the whole body . Water reduces inflammation by lowering the temperature , equalising the circulation , and by cooling , contracting the capillaries , and driving the blood out of them . This contraction or constriction of the capillaries is also connected with an infusion of nervous power and quickened circulation , which contributes to a return of healthy action . Water invigorates in many ways ; by the very process of purification obstructions are removed , and the nervous energy allowed to act freely ; by the equalisation of the circulation , the whole system acts in harmony , and its force is augmented by being well distributed ; by the direct action of cold in quickening the action of the capillaries ; by the re-action of the heat-forming power of the nervous system , quickening the circulation , especially in the capillaries , and developing vital heat , which seems to be only an expression of vital energy . This last is a very curious matter . It seems to be governed by the general law of exercise . If we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet pack , he may be long in re-acting against it , or in getting warm . We carefully proportion the length of the bath or the quantity of the sheet to this re-active power . But , like Other powers , it gains strength by exercise . Every clay the patient re-acts better ; and we find that the whole strength or vital energy increases with this power of re-acting against cold , until we have a restoration to health . This is the process of invigoration . It is a kind of vital gymnastics , or education of the organic powers . We push the purifying process , and join it with the invigorating , by exciting the action of the skin by long packs in the wet sheet , or in dry blankets , followed by  | a cold bath . We prolong the invigorating process in the partial application of the sitz-bath ; and both purification and invigoration are combined in the wet jackets , bandages , and compresses . Thus , water is the great agent of vigour and purity ; of the first , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second , by its solvent power . It seems also to possess magnetic or electric properties of a peculiar kind , which act upon the nervous system ; a kind of vitality , especially when freshly drawn and living . Our own vitality is probably nourished by a great element of vitality in nature , of which water is one of the mediums ; and hence its enlivening and invigorating influence . Water has been considered the material corespondent of the Divine Truth , and its effect upon the body corresponds to that of truth upon the soul , purifying and invigorating . Light can never be neglected as a curative agent , or a condition of health .. The sick are often shut up in darkness . On the contrary , they should have an extra share of light , and , if possible , bask in the direct rays of the sun . Animal magnetism , or the power which one person has of strengthening the vitality of another , and controlling its action , may often be used with singular advantage . Congeniality , friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all their expressions , should never be lost sight of as remedial agents , giving vigour to the soul , and influencing every bodily function . This is the materia medica of nature . I shall now describe more particularly the processes to be used in the treatment of disease , with their applications , and the errors to be guarded against . I wish to make these directions so plain , that no reader of this book may ever be obliged to write to me for further explanations .  | PROCESSES OF WATER CURE . THE water used in most of the processes of water-cure should be fresh , soft , clean , and newly drawn . It should be soft , especially for drinking , and soft water is better for bathing ; but hard or salt water , if cold and living , has less cleansing , but abundant invigorating qualities . Whenever water is to be applied continuously to the surface , so as to be absorbed , as in the long tepid or half-bath , the sitz-bath , and for compresses , bandages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be procured ? and more especially for drinking . Sea-bathing is peculiarly stimulating , tonic , and invigorating . The temperature of water for ordinary bathing should be considerably below that . of the body . The temperature of the blood varies but slightly from 98 degrees Fahrenheit . A very feeble person may bathe in water at 70 degrees , but those who are more vigorous should use it colder ; and the lower the temperature , the more sudden and powerful is the shock , and the more rapid and perfect the re-action . The immediate effect of cold water is to drive the blood from the part to which it is applied . The nerves , feeling the want of blood , as the element of vitality , and of warmth , which is the sensible expression of vitality , call it back . This is what is termed re-action . The blood returns , producing redness , a glowing warmth , and a feeling of vigour in the part . You may try this by merely dipping the hand in very cold water a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body . In this way we strengthen the whole skin ; we act upon the periphery of the whole system of the nerves of  | sensation ; we quicken the action of millions of capillaries ; we strengthen the circulation ; we invigorate the whole body . The effect of warm water , on the other hand , is to soften sensation , expand the capillaries , lower the tone , and enfeeble the action . Hot water , indeed , is stimulating , but its subsequent effect is debilitating . It is little used in water-cure , for this reason ; but we sometimes resort to it in emergencies . For example , in congestion of the brain or lungs , we put the feet and legs into hot water , while we apply cold to the part affected . We also apply warm water to a part when we wish to backen a crisis , subdue irritation , diminish action , lessen certain secretions , as that of milk in the breasts , or diminish inflammation . The warm bath has also a soothing effect upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Warm hip-baths and hot fomentations are used to allay uterine pains , and give relief in colic . But the very property by which warm water soothes makes it weakening , and it is to be avoided , except in emergencies . Pain of the most violent kind , and even convulsions , are cured by the application of cold water ; but it should be very cold and applied freely . In inflammations , fevers , and in all cases where the heat of the system is kept up , we may apply cold without fear . It is in cases of great exhaustion , internal congestion , and collapse , without the strength to re act , that cold i dangerous . Even in these conditions , when applie quickly , and in a way to secure re-action , it is sometimes of the greatest benefit . The General Bath. ? Every person should be washed all over in water , at least once every day of their lives . In infancy or age , at home or abroad , sick or well , there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whsle body needs it , just as much as  | the face and hands ; and it can be done , at a pinch , with a pint of water , with the hand , a wet towel , or a sponge . With two or three quarts of water , and a sponge or towel , you can have a glorious bath ; begin by washing the head , an 1 then the entire body . End by a thorough rubbing with hands and towels , the coarser the better , and you have done your skin something like justice . A more thorough and exciting bath may be taken by placing before the wash-stand a broad shallow pan or tub to stand in ; then use the sponge as before , squeezing the water over the head or back of the neck and letting it flow down the body . A towel bath is preferred by some to a sponge bath . Fold the towel lengthwise once , then across . Dip this quarto in the basin and wash face , head , and arms , stooping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel into the wash-basin , and wash down the chest , abdomen , and legs ; open out the full length , dip , and saw down the back from head to knees ; fold , and wash down in front , finishing with the feet ; squat down on haunches and thoroughly wash the lower part of the body ; stand up , and raising the wash-bowl to the chin , pour the water so as to run down over the whole body . Wipe thoroughly with a soft and then with a rough towel , combining vigorous exercise with a lively friction .. Some kind of a general bath should be taken on rising , except where the debility and consequent chilliness are too great , when it may be postponed to midforenoon . A bath is also always taken on coming out of either a wet sheet or blanket pack , or vapour , or hot air bath . The warmer a person is the better he can bear a full bath , and it is never better than when the body is covered with perspiration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfounded . If a man thoroughly fatigued and over-heated , goes into cold water , and remains long , it may produce a severe  | and even fatal chill ; but a quick bath and good rubbing is always refreshing . In dry and feverish states of the system , a bath may be taken as often as it is agreeable , if every hour . When a fever patient is too feeble to stand up and be bathed , he may be washed , lying down , with a sponge or towel . In whatever manner taken , the bath is cooling , cleansing , and invigorating , though it may prove warming to a cold person , by exciting reaction , and increasing the vigour of the circulation . The Dripping Sheet is a capital general bath , especially for invalids who require assistance . It can be had wherever there is a clean sheet and water enough to wet it . Let it just drip , throw it around the person to be bathed , and rub over it with the hands for half a minute or longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured over the patient , who stands or crouches in a tub is also one of the best in use . There are few persons who can not take one pail of cold water poured quickly over them , and followed by a brisk rubbing . The weakest persons bear such a bath , and feel the stronger for taking it . he Plunge-Bath-is any way of getting into the water all cver , wetting the head first , as in all general baths . The common long baths are very good , but a tank of cold spring water four or five feet deep and large enough to swim in , is glorious . This bath , especially by all weak persons , should be taken quickly . Plunge in , and jump out again , dance about , and have a good rubbing . If you go into a river , or place large enough to scrim , the exercise will enable you to stay in longer ; but even here , staying in too long produces exhaustion . The Shower-Bath is often injurious , from the strong chil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seldom used in water-cure . Tlu Hal/Bath. ? This is one of the most powerful  | means of acting upon the whole system , reducing fever , removing local congestions , equalising the circulation , and controlling spasmodic action . The patient sits in a tub ? a common bathing-tub is best ? with the water four inches deep . He is then wet-rubbed all over with the hands of one or two , and water poured over him with a pail , from time to time , or dashed forcibly against him as the rubbing proceeds , in which the patient , if able , should assist . I have used this bath in severe congestive fever , with the water at 8o degrees , applying colder water to the head and chest , with great advantage . Priesnitz used this bath quite cold in many cases , and sometimes for four or five hours at a time , and with it he relieved severe congestions , ague , lockjaw , insanity , and cholera , even in the stage of collapse . The rubbing should be thorough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long continued . When the patient comes out , let him be dry-rubbed and wrapped up in blankets ? not packed , but well covered in bed . The Sitz-Bath. ? This admirable bath may be taken very well in a medium-sized washing-tub , but the ordinary hip-bath is more convenient . Fill it so that when the patient sits in it it will be half-full of water . It is well to begin with about 70 degrees in ordinary cases , and make it colder every day , until we come down to the common temperature of well or spring water . What I mean by 70 degrees , if you have no thermometer , is water " with the chill off , " or moderately cool . Remove the clothing sufficiently , and sit in the water , from three to six inches deep , from five to fifteen minutes . You may aid the effect by rubbing the submerged surface with the hand . When you come out , dry and rub the parts with a towel ; and if the water is cold , you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tells what is going on in the capillary system . It is well for delicate person ;  | to begin with cool water ? water with the chill off ; and use it colder every day until they can take it quite cold . The cold sitz-bath relieves congestion of the brain , cures piles and constipation , dysentery , and is a sovereign remedy for weakness of the generative organs , falling of the womb , ovarian diseases , etc . It should be taken through pregnancy , and afterward until full recovery . Every such bath gives a strength that no one can conceive of , who has not tried it , or seen its beneficial operation . The Douche. ? This is a stream of water , of an inch or more in diameter , falling from ten to twenty feet . It is a very powerful application , bringing a great quantity of water rapidly to act upon a surface , and with considerable mechanical force . It must not be taken on the head , which must be first wet , but may fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest and limbs , for from one to five minutes . It is a most powerful invigorator . It excites great capillary action , even to the dispersion of indolent tumours . Patients are so excited and toned up by this bath , that they are apt to take more than is prescribed to them . An Ascending Douche , or fountain-bath , may be constructed with a rising stream of water , so as to act upon the lower part of the pelvis . It is excellent for piles , disease of the prostate , and seminal weaknesses in men , and for corresponding affections in women ; and is an admirable remedy for all the irritations , inflammations , weaknesses , and morbid conditions of the lower bowel , womb , and generally of the pelvic viscera . The rising douche , or fountainbath , may be found at most hydropathic establishments , but was not until now available in home or general practice . I have , however , recently invented a portable fountain-bath , or rising douche , which has several  | striking advantages . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , supplied with fresh or salt water of any temperature , and its force is under perfect and instant control . It is furnished at a moderate price , and can be sent to any part of the world . Head baths , hand baths , foot-baths , etc. , are full or partial immersions of these parts in water . The headbath is taken lying on the floor with the head resting in a basin of water ; but a wet towel upon the head , renewed as required , is more convenient . When the feet and hands are habitually cold , they may be treated together , by dipping them in cold water a moment , then taking them out , and rubbing the feet with the hands , and repeating the process until both are warm . The Vapour-Bath. ? The steam or vapour-bath is not much used in water-cure , but where a quick and powerful action of the skin is desired , it is often useful . In severe colds , with a dry skin and chilly extremities , a single vapour-bath , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit on a common cane-bottom chair , have blankets or a similar covering pinned around you , so as to leave your head free ; place under the chair a tin vessel of water , over a spirit lamp . The water , to save time , may be first brought to the boiling point . For want of a proper lamp , the alcohol , or strong spirit of any kind , may be burnt in an open cup . Or , placing boiling water under the chair , the steam may be raised by putting in it hot irons , bricks , or stones . In a few moments the perspiration begins . It may go on for twenty minutes . Come out , and take a thorough cold bath . This must never be neglected . It is the only way in which the skin can be left in good condition . The Lamp-bath is given in the same way , but with the lamp only , or burning spirits , without water . It is occasionally useful . but too debilitating for regular treatment ,  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrung out of cold water , folded into four or eight thicknesses , and laid upon the part affected . If it is an inflamed part we wish to cool , it may be left uncovered and often renewed . If , on the contrary , it is a torpid part , in which we wish to excite action , we cover the compress , and let it remain acting like a poultice . This last application is of great use in cases of indolent swellings , rheumatic joints , torpid livers , indurated spleens , weak stomachs , etc . Fomentations are compresses wrung out of hot water ; and to relieve pains , dissipate congestion , and lessen the action of the part . The Wet Bandage. ? This is an extension of the compress , and one of the most convenient and salutary applications in water-cure . As commonly worn , it is a towel , folded two or more thicknesses , so as to make a girdle ten inches wide . It is wrung out of cold water , and pinned around the loins so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful support , and strengthens better than body braces or supporters , which weaken the muscles they are intended to aid . The wet bandage should be worn during pregnancy , and in all cases of female weakness . It acts upon the great nervous centres of the abdominal and pelvic viscera . It may be worn night and day , and renewed as often as it gets dry or feels uncomfortable . If it cause chilly sensations , wear more covering or a dry bandage , flannel , or othenvise , over it . Wet bandages are also worn around the middle , to strengthen the stomach , and excite the action of the liver ? around the chest , in bronchial and pulmonary affections , to relieve the mucous membrane , by exciting the action of the skin ? and around the throat , in either acute or chronic affections in that region . The Wet jacket , made of towelling or coarse linen , or cotton , without sleeves , and so as to cover the  | whole chest with a tolerable fit , pinning over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and worn as a substitute for the bandage . Wear clothing enough , night and day , so as not to chill . The Wet-Sheet Pack is a curative agent of astonishmg efficacy . It consists of one or two comfortables , three or four woollen blankets , and a linen or cotton sheet . Spread the blankets , which should be moderately warm in cold weather , on the bed , with pillows at the head under them . Take a sheet , large or small , thick or thin , as the case requires ; wring it pretty close out : of cold water ? spread it on the blankets . Let the . patient lie down at full length on the sheet , which must be quickly folded around him . Then bring over the first blanket , first one side and then the other , , drawing it closely around the neck , tucking it about the feet , and making it snug all the way down . Do the same with each blanket , making all comfortably snug . The Germans put a small feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the comfortables , or any common bed covering will answer the same purpose . There must be covering enough , and the outer one less pervious than blankets .. See that the feet are well wrapped up , and that the head is in a good position . If the patient is feverish , the sheet may cover all but the face . If inclined to be chilly , the sheet may only come down to the ankles . Sometimes we begin by letting the sheet come down only to the knees ; sometimes by only putting a wet towel around under the arms . These are partial wet-sheet packs . In most cases , the sensations of the patient in the pack are delightful after the first shock of the sheet . In five minutes there is a glow all over the body ; then comes an indescribably calm , soothing feeling , from the emollient effect of the wet sheet upon the skin , or the nerves of sensation . All pain is relieved better  | tnan by any opiate . Generally , in ten of lateen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an hour or less , he breaks out into a profuse perspiration . Now is the time to take him out , by undoing the coverings quickly , and as quickly giving him some kind of a full bath , a dripping sheet , a sponge-bath , a pouring-bath , or any kind of a quick thorough washdown with cold water . A good wiping and rubbing with coarse towels and the bare hands , completes the operation . In fevers the packs may be short and frequent , but in all chronic cases they should be long enough for a full action on the skin . Sensible perspiration may not come at first , and a general glow is sufficient . There is no absolute time for a wet-sheet pack . One patient may be hot , restless , and even in a perspiration in half an hour ; another may warm up slowly , and require to stay in two hours . When the pack is likely to be a long one , let the patient empty the bladder just before going in . In long packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be used without coming out . For children , the blankets may be ' folded , and the sheets made of a proportional size . Infants a week old take the full wet-sheet packs ( in a thin towel ) with great advantage . In all the diseases of infancy , in the inflammation and irritation of teething , in pain of the bowels , in feverishness , it gives instant relief . In measles , chicken-pox , and scarlet fever , it can not be too soon resorted to , nor scarcely too often repeated , except in delicate children , where packing in the wet sheet , after the fever is subdued , may be injurious . But for all febrile and eruptive diseases , it is the Bove ? reign remedy , and brings out these eruptions in the most wonderful manner . The most cross , sickliest baby generally goes to sleep in five minutes after being put in the pack .  | The Sweating Blanket Pack is the same process , but without the wet sheet . Pack the patie : : t in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e sweats . if nol too tired , he may sweat half an hour ; then take him out , and give him a bath . The blanket pack may also be given just long enough to accumulate heat , so that the patient may take a cold bath with advantage . The sweating pack is used where we wish to purify the system rapidly by the action of the skin , and where we wish to excite this organ . It may be used alterns.tely with the wet-sheet in skin diseases , as salt rheum , in chronic rheumatism , in asthma and bronchitis , and in all torpid and poisoned conditions . Patients full of quinine , calomel , opium , or tobacco , if they can bear this process , find it a rapid means of cure . In affections of the throat , the blanket pack often proves successful , alternating with other methods , especially with the wet-sheet pack . When patients are chilling , a hot bottle may be placed at the feet ; but artificial heat is to be used with caution . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter should be cool or cold , and taken with a syringe that will hold eight or ten ounces , with a tube , the globular end of which is pierced with several small holes . By this means cold water may be thrown forcibly upon the uterus . These injections , to the amount of two quarts at a time , may be taken several times a-day , and no woman should be without the means of taking them . They remedy , and if persevered in , with other right habits , cure every weakness and disease of the female sexual organs . I have adopted injection and irrigation tubes to my Portable Fountain Bath , so that they can be taken with grea ' facility . Old persons , delicate women , and feeble children must be treated with care , and it is better , to be safe , to make the water a few degrees warmer , than to do  | mischief . There is danger in certain persons of producing congestion of the lungs , by giving too cold sitz or other baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet is wet should be quite cold , but we may lessen the size of the sheet , and wring it close . The baths which follow a pack must also be cold , but may be very quickly given . But in sitz-baths , rubbing-baths , rising douche , and injections , the water may be used with the chill off , especially at beginning . It is not necessary to suspend treatment during menstruation . Time is needlessly lost , and it is at this time that women most need treatment . 1Vear the bandage , take sitz-baths , and use the vagina syringe the same as usual . All sheets , bandages , compresses , etc. , used in water cure must be washed every day , and often boiled , or they are made very filthy by the impurities which come from the skin . If the same cloths are used without washing , these matters are re-absorbed . Every mother should have a small syringe , holding two or three ounces , to give injections to her infants . Some children have torpid bowels until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved by the use of injections . A water emetic should be taken whenever there is more gastric irritation from matter in the stomach than merely drinking a glass of water will quell . Drink as much lukewarm water as you can swallow , then tickle the fauces with your finger or the feather end of a quill . No cold bath , pack , or any process requiring reaction , should be taken within half an hour before or two hours after a meal . When the blood and nervous power are in the skin they can not be secreting gastric juice for the stomach , nor vice versa . We can not act powerfully with two great organs at the same time , and the blood and vitality go where there is the loudest call Eat a hearty meal , and then take violent exercise ,  | or exert gfeat mental effort , or take a cold bath , and you produce a chill , or , perhaps , vomiting ? perhaps a long fit of indigestion . Bathing is exercise . If any other be taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GENERAL DIRECTIONS : The mind of the patient should be free from all care , trouble , anxiety , sorrow , or irritation . Avoid gloomy conversation and thought . Shun repulsive occupation and unpleasant society . Labour or exercise so as to produce moderate fatigue , but not exhaustion . No greater fatigue should be incurred than a night 's rest will remove . Exercise in the open air , and as many muscles as you can . If walking is too exhausting , ride on horseback or in a carriage . If not able to take exercise , be rubbed freely over the whole body . Be much in the open air , and have all your rooms well ventilated . Windows should be open at top and bottom , with no impediment from shades and curtains . Breathe pure , fresh air , night and day . Have your rooms light as well as airy . Exposure of the whole body to air and light , even the direct rays of the sun , when not too powerful , is a potent means of cure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable in regard to temperature . No article must be worn at night that is worn by day ; and all clothing , for person or bed , should be thoroughly aired , daily and nightly . Keep the body warm with sufficient underclothing ? under-jackets and drawers . Many people , and especially delicate women , suffer from continual chilliness . Underclothing should be often changed ? the cleaner the better . Sleep on a mattress of hair , wool , straw , etc. ; not on feathers . The covering should be very clean , thoroughly aired daily , light . norous , warm , but not  | too warm . A hot water bottle is better than cold feet , but it should be removed as soon as possible . A water-cure diet excludes all fat , greasy , oily substances , except a small quantity of oil or good butter ; all smoked or very salt meats and fish , pickles and preserves ; all pork , lard , sausages , mince pies , geese , ducks , veal , eels , and all oily fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake or pastry , spices , or condiments , except a moderate use of vinegar , salt , and sugar , honey , or molasses . Tea , coffee , spirits , tobacco , and all medicinal drugs , are strictly prohibited . Abundant and healthful nutriment may be found in the following articles Farinacea. ? Wheat , unbolted , as bread or porridge ; oatmeal porridge , or gruel ; rye bread , Indian corn bread , hominy , etc. ; rice , tapioca , sago , arrowroot , etc . Fruit. ? Apples , peaches , pears , strawberries , grapes , whortleberries , blackberries , plums , bananas , melons , oranges , figs , dates . In winter , stewed apples , peaches , prunes , etc . Vegetables. ? Potatoes , common and sweet , green peas , shell and string beans , turnips , beets , broccoli , cabbage , onions , carrots , parsnips , spinach , spring greens , etc . AnimalisedSubstances. ? M ilk , cream , butter , mild and tender cheese ; eggs ? soft-boiled , poached , scrambled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all cases , slightly cooked , etc . Fish. ? Scale fish , fresh and in their season . Oysters , do. , raw or cooked rare . Flesh. ? Lean mutton , beef , venison , chicken , turkey , wild fowl of a similar character . White meats are preferable to dark . The best cures are made upon a simple vegetable diet . When persons will eat animal food , the above varieties are least hurtful . A strict diet consists of a few of the best articles of , farinacea and fruit , with a little milk , in all not exceed-  | ing six ounces of nutriment a-day . A moderate diet nifty include a greater variety of articles , and ten ounces of nutriment . A full diet , suitable to a condition of health , may vary from twelve to sixteen ounces of nutriment aday . Of course the water which forms so large a portion of fruits and vegetables is not reckoned as nutriment . Eat slowly , masticate thoroughly , and be sure that a single ounce more than the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritant , and exhausts vitality . Rest mind and body after every meal . Take no bath for half an hour before , or two hours after eating . Eat at regular intervals . When more than two meals a-day are taken , let the last meal be lightest ; and no invalid should eat later than four P.m. , or six hours before retiring to rest . If in pain , or wearied , or without an appetite , fast . Fatigue , before eating , may hinder digestion , as may labour , excitement , or any exhausting process after it . No food should be put in the mouth hot , and none should be swallowed cold ; that will be prevented by a good mastication . Milk being classed as food , the only drink should be pure , soft water . Where the spring water is hard , filtered or clean rain water is better . The quantity drank may be in proportion to thirst and exercise , but even pure , soft water may be taken to excess . If drinking chills , sip slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital stock of vitality has been reduced , it must be husbanded with care . Amative excitement and indulgence , of whatever kind , and under whatever circumstances , must be carefully avoided . More vitality may be lost in one moment , than can be gained by weeks of persevering treatment . In the young of both sexes , the debilitated , those labouring under chronic disease , in female weaknesses , and during gestation and lactation , there should be no excitement of the roductive system . Parents can not too carefully  | guard their children against the health and life-destroying abuses of this function , from which the period of infancy is not always exempt . It will be evident that in the water-cure processes we act chiefly upon the surface of the body . This surface comprises about fifteen square feet . It contains millions of sudoriferous or sweat-making glands , tnd a vast number of sebaceous or oil-secreting . It . : ontains an immense capillary reticulation , and a wonderful expansion of nerves , both organic and sensational . In acting upon the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can in no other manner . We can weaken or strengthen , enliven or depress , bring the blood to the surface or drive it back upon the viscera . By exciting the action of the skin , we rapidly free the system of its impurities , and relieve , rest , and invigorate the internal organs . An oppression of the lungs is relieved almost instantly by opening the pores , and increasing the action of the skin ; a diarrhoea is quickly cured by making the skin throw off the matter which is coming from the mucous membrane . Profuse expectorations from chronic bronchitis are rapidly diminished in this way , and attacks of asthma relieved and cured . The changes of nutrition , waste , and excretion are so much quickened in water-cure , that Liebig , who examined it carefully at Graefenburg , says in a letter to Sir Charles Scudamore , that as great a change is often effected in six weeks as would be accomplished in three years without it . The system is therefore freed from its old diseased matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather important , then , that the new matter of nutrition should be of the purest quality . The quantity and quality of morbid matter thrown from the skin , the lungs , the kidneys , ande bowels ,  | during a course of water ? cure , is sometimes astonishing , even to those best acquainted with its efficacy . The bath-room is filled with dense vapour by the active skin ; and we can smell opium , tobacco , mercury , and other drugs which may have been taken years before . The blankets used in packing require to be thoroughly aired every day . I have been poisoned by inhaling this diseased matter , and I was once inoculated with it , by handling a sheet in which a patient had been packed . Patients have collected globules of mercury which came out under their wet bandages , though they had taken none for years . Bandages and sheets are often stained by matters which come from the skin , and they are at times so corroded as to fall in pieces . It is not uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , and especially when packing and bandaging are not enough attended to , these outpourings of morbid matter are of a more violent and painful character . This is what is called crisis . There is a sudden breaking up of morbid matter , which comes away in a mass , sometimes by a flood of thick or gravelly urine ; sometimes by a violent sweating which lasts for days ; sometimes by vomiting ; often by a diarrhoea which will last for a week and carry off an unaccountable quantity of matter ; very commonly by an eruption on the skin , which may come out over the whole surface , but more likely under the compresses and bandages , or over the seat of disease ; or , lastly ? and this is the severest form of crisis ? the patient may have crops of boils over the whole body . I have known forty at a time . They are unpleasant , but bring a wonderful relief . As they pour out matter , the internal organs are left free from it , and I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the appearance of a crop of boils over the chest . which threw off matter  | precisely like that which had been expectorated . All these facts go strongly to confirm Francke 's theory of the " sliming up " of morbid matter , until some action is set up by nature , or by water-cure processes , in aid of nature , to set it free . When the system is filled with this matter , though we may seem to be in health , it is always oppressing us ; and a large portion of our strength is expended in guarding it ; the least disturbance , as cold or fatigue , sets free a portion of it ; it always tends to any exhausted or weakened part ; it finds its way into wounds ; it keeps up ulcerations ; it is liable to oppress the brain by tuberculous gatherings , or cause consumption of the lungs , or disease of the mesenteric glands , or other fatal disorders . In the scientific and judicious practice of the watercure , this matter is carried out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition supplies the place of the bad matter removed , and the whole organism is built up afresh . When crisis occurs , the patient is to fast , rest , and moderate his treatment . Use the water a little less cold ; in sweating , wash often ; in diarrhoea , fast and take frequent injections ; in eruptions and boils , take wet-sheet packs . There are diseased conditions which no treatment can cure , or long relieve . When a vital organ has been destroyed , or made permanently useless , the patient must sink . When vitality has been so exhausted by any cause that the process of purification can not be carried on , the poor body must clog up and perish . When a certain amount of disease has settled upon the brain or its membranes , or the spinal cord ; when the lungs are solidified or disorganised , so as to prevent the uses of respiration ; when the liver can no longer perform its function ; when digestion is destroyed ; when the mesenteric glands are solidified or tuberculated , clogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the hurt is disorganised ; when  | the organic nervous system can no longer give vigour to the capillary system , and carry on the processes of nutrition and secretion , then comes the inevitable Death . A wise use of the directions given in this book will aid nature in doing all possibilities ; but some diseases , or conditions of disease , are inevitably fatal . Although I say little of the use of medicines , believing that most of the drugs used of late years in Allopathic medication do more evil than good , I have no wish to utterly condemn them . There is evident use , in many cases , in a quick , active emetic . One may do much worse than take a dose of castor-oil , or epsom salts , or many of the aperient mineral waters , in any special need ; but it is not well to be in the habit of using any cathartic medicine whatever . So of stimulants . One may take wine or spirits in an emergency with benefit ? but the habit of resorting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all anesthetic agents . Chloroform has been fatal to many . Ether is much less dangerous . The nitrous oxide gas , now so much used in dental operations , is comparatively . safe , but has not been so in all cases . Chloral , the new opiate , is very seductive , and dangerous to use habitually . Pure health needs no stimulation or medication . Genuine hlomceopathy is assuredly harmless ; and there is abundant testimony to the efficacy of many homoeopathic medicines , as of belladonna in throat diseases and scarlatina . Many water-cure physicians give the proper horneeopathic remedies . And the experiente , perhaps we may say the instincts , of mankind testify to the benefit , in a multitude of cases , of simple vegetable medicines , roots and herbs , and the herb teas , made of roots , leaves , and flowers , so largely used in France , and more or less among all civilised and savage nations .  | The Turkish Bath , I need hardly say , is , in the cases to which it is adapted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid and powerful mode of puri'i.cation and invigoration . DISEASES AND TREATMENT . MEDICAL systems vary in the nomenclature and classification of diseases . They are divided into local and general , organic and functional . In medical books we have enumerated Diseases of Periods ? infancy , manhood , old age . Diseases of Sex ? as those peculiar to men and women . Diseases of Regions ? as of the head , chest , abdomen , pelvis . Diseases of Condition or Callings ? as of the rich , the poor , professional men , literary men , artists , manufacturers , labourers , etc . Diseases of Function ? as of digestion , circulation , respiration , secretion , innervation , generation , gestation , locomotion , etc . Diseases of Tissues ? as of the skin , mucous and serous membranes , vascular , nervous , fibrous , osseous tissues , etc . Diseases of Organs ? as the eye , ear , throat , brain , lungs , stomach , liver , kidneys , uterus , etc. , etc . In the system of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases are divided into four classes , each including nerval orders . Under Class I. ? Zymotic Diseases ( zyme , a ferment , ) are included epidemic , endemic , and contagious diseases , and those caused  | by specific poisons , and food or want of food . The four orders are i. ? Miasmatic Diseases ( tainted ) , as small-pox , measles , scarlet fever , diphtheria , typhus and typhoid fevers , cholera , ague , etc . Order 2 , Enthetic Diseases ( implanted ) , as syphilis , gonorrhoea , glanders , hydrophobia , malignant pustule , etc . Order 3 . Dietic Diseases , as famine-fever , scurvy , purpura , rickets , delirium tremens , and all the effects of stimulants and narcotics . Order 4 . Parasitic Diseases , as itch , worms , ring-worm , scald-head , etc . Class II. ? Constitutional Diseases , containing two orders . r . Diathetic Diseases , as gout , anemia , cancer , etc. ; and 2 . Tubercular Diseases , as scrofula , phthisis ( tubercular consumption ) , mesenteric disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hereditary . Class III. ? Local Diseases , contains , order 1 . Diseases of the Brain or Nervous System , as apoplexy , paralysis , epilepsy , chorea ( St. Vitus ' dance ) , hysteria , mania , etc. 2 . Diseases of the Heart and Bloom Vessels . 3 . Lung Diseases , as bronchitis , pneumonia , pleurisy , asthma , etc. 4 . Diseases of the Digestive System , as inflammations of the stomach or intestines , jaundice , etc. ; and orders 5 , 6 , and 7 are diseases of the kidneys , generative organs , bones , muscles , and skin . Class IV . includes Developmental Diseases . 1 . In children , as malformations , idiocy , teething ; 2 . Of women , relating to menstruation and childbirth ; 3 . Of old age ; 4 . Of nutrition , as atrophy , debility , etc . In examining the patient to ascertain the nature of the disease , the points necessary for the physician to know are the age ; sex ; condition , bodily , mental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ; - parentage , and the probabilities of hereditary predispositions ; past history of patient , diseases and medication ; regularity of certain functions , as menstruation or defxcation ; the amative function , strong or weak , exercised or not ? olitarily or socially , and ,  | in either case , to what extent ; present condition ; pain ; tenderness ; derangement of action , and what kind ; pulse ; respiration ; state of mind and temper ; strength ; disposition to exercise , state of the skin , tongue , teeth , hair , senses . There are nervous affections dependent upon exhaustion , that are difficult to locate or find a name for ; flying pains which change about from one part to another ; the feelings usually termed hysterical , and states of depression and general weakness , which come from bodily , or mental , or spiritual exhaustion . But in most cases , we are able to locate a disease in the head , the chest , the abdomen , the pelvis , the bones , the joints , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the membranes , or the skin . We pursue the investigation until the complaint is cornered . We find where it is not , and then narrow it down to where it is . In a personal examination , the physician , taking in with one glance twenty other particulars , as they are disclosed by the appearance , complexion , weight , motions , attitudes , and tones of the patient , may ask first of all , " Where is the pain ? " Another will sit down more patiently , and say , " What is the story ? " There are certain signs of diseases which are worthy of special attention . A bad smelling breath is a sign of foul or decaying teeth , indigestion , or constipation . Early decay of teeth is a sign of hereditary weakness , early exhaustion , or chronic dyspepsia . A tongue creased , and cut into deep furrows , is a sign of dyspepsia . Light hair , fair complexion , and a thick upper lip , are signs of scrofula . A dry , hard skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hollow eyes , dark circles around them , flabbiness , and emaciation , 2 re all signs of ex  | hausting causes of disease . A moist , clammy skin is sometimes found in dyspepsia . A pulse steadily above a hundred a minute in an adult , indicates high general fever , or severe internal inflammation . If in a chronic case , and combined with regularly progressive emaciation , it indicates a dangerous and probably fatal disease of some vital organ . An unnaturally slow pulse , a feeble pulse , and an intermitting pulse , are signs of great nervous exhaustion . A small pulse with rigors , is a sign of internal congestion , or what is the same thing , a want of action in the external capillaries . Paralysis , insensibility , with regular and rather slow pulse , and deep breathing , show compression of the brain from injury or apoplexy . Delirium is a sign of cerebral congestion without effusion . Other signs of disease will be noted as we come to the symptoms which characterise those we are about to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a disease . There are diseases of the mind , and affections or sentiments , as well as of the bodily organs . Home Sickness is a common , and sometimes a fatal disease . Its cause is simply a removal from home . The more striking the change , the severer the malady . A Swiss who leaves his Alps , an Arab taken from his desert , and a Greenlander from his icebergs , all suffer from the pangs of this disease . It is marked by pining , melancholy , sighing , weeping , depression , and death . The cure is to return home ; if this is impracticable , some other passion should be excited , as ambition or love . Love Sickness is like the last , but more common , and often more severe . A disappointment in love sometimes crushes and kills . The patient may-die suddenly  | of a broken heart , or gradually pine away . Its symptoms are like those of home sickness , but more tender and pitiful . Sometimes the intellect is affected with a temporary or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . Union with fhe object beloved is a cure , if it comes in season ; a cure is also often happily effected by transferring the affection to another object . Other passions also are a relief ; and any employment of the mind which interests or gives vivid pleasure . Travel , art , reading , occupation , benevolence , and religion , are all useful . Religion , or the combined passions of faith , hope , reverence , and conscientiousness , is often in a state of disease . We have no mad-house without its religious maniacs . As this is a more complex sentiment , its modes of disease are more varied . Great efforts are made in revivals , camp-meetings , and on many other occasions to excite this feeling ; and we often see its morbid manifestations . These are , at times , reflected upon the body , producing strange convulsions , swoonings , paroxysms and ecstasies . In its mild form it is enthusiasm ; in its severe , fanaticism ; in its repulsive , it is bigotry . This disease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly contagious . jealousy is a very bad and a very prevalent passional disease , and few diseases cause more anguish to the sufferer , or more discomfort to others . It is often treated as a wickedness ? we may call it so , if we please , but it is a disease . A wickedness , properly speaking , is a voluntary thing . Jealousy is involuntary . It is sudden or gradual , violent or mild , acute or chronic . It has its own internal , pie-disposing , cause ; but the external exciting cause may be either real or imaginary . It is a morbid manifestation of love , corn bined with distrust , fear , and spiritual poverty . How shall we cure jealousy ? It has been argued  | against by the philosophers , and ridiculed by the wits of all ages . It disorders the mind , sours the temper , affects the appetite and digestion , seems to interfere with the bilious secretion , and gives a dull , hard pain around the heart . It leads oftener than any other passional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must adopt appropriate modes of treatment . Many are cured by friendship , or ambition , or love . Many are benefited by music , by books , by society . I have known a severe and long-continued fit of mental depression to be cured by a single tune . A world of new life may come into the soul from a beautiful picture , or a beautiful woman . As a general rule , the best way to keep a healthy mind , is to give it a healthy body for its basis , so the best guarantee for spiritual health , is to preserve the health , the combined animal and organic systems . I will endeavour to give such an account of diseases and treatment as the general reader can understand , and may find practically useful . I begin with some general diseases , and follow with diseases of systems , organs , etc . Fever is the name given to a general and somewhat violent effort of the system to free itself from the matter of disease . Fevers are characterised by pain , heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic , and consequent prostration of the locomotive . The causes of fever are too great quantity or bad quality of food , want of cleanliness , bad air , poisonings of many kinds , with so much exhaustion , that the system can not rid herself of their effects without a special effort . The immediate cause of an attack of fever may be chill , fatigue , worry , or any unusual cause of disturbance or exhaustion . Fever begins , generally , with a chill or rigor , followed by pain in the head , back , and limbs , weakness , heat of the surface , throbbing of the arteries , loss of  | appetite , constipation ; there is great thirst , quick pulse , hurried breathing ; it terminates with more or less violent critical action , generally of the skin , in profuse sweatings , often with copious discharges from the kidneys and bowels . The action in fever may be concentrated upon some particular portion of the system . If the disease is chiefly local , it is called inflammation , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much general disturbance , we speak of brain fever , lung fever , gastric fever , etc . Intermittent Fever ? chills and fever ? fever and ague is one of the simplest and best defined forms of this disease . It begins with a chill , or rigor , which may last from half an hour to two or three hours ; be mild or severe , with a shivering of the whole body , and a feeling of coldness which no fire can warm . The external capillaries collapse , and the blood is thrown upon the internal organs . The second stage is that of fever , with pain , throbbing , heat , thirst . This lasts an hour or two , and is followed by a crisis of perspiration . The attack is repeated on the next day but one , the third , or even the fourth day . Cause. ? Malaria , acting upon a system too weak to resist , or free itself in any other manner . Efects. ? This disease is not generally considered dangerous , but it is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the chill may produce general collapse and coma , from which there is no reaction . As usually treated by quinine , arsenic , piperine , and other violent or insidious poisons , the cause of disease and the remedies both remain in the system , producing various chronic diseases . Treatment. ? As in all cases , we must aid nature in her efforts , keep them within safe limits , and as far as possible invigorate and purify . If practicable , the patient should remove from a malarious region . This  | alone is often sufficient for a cure . But if we must labour under the disadvantage of curing the disease , while subject to its cause , we must do the best we can . The chill may be broken by a very cold pouring bath and rubbing , or by the half-bath . This produces a more rapid re-action . After the cold bath and rubbing , the patient may be enveloped in blankets . He may drink water freely , but not too cold . When the fever comes on , either give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I prefer the latter . When the patient has sweated half an hour , give him a pouring-bath or dripping sheet ; place him in a clean , cool bed , and let him rest . But in whatever way he passes through the attack , the treatment must be kept up in the intervals . Give one or two wet-sheet packs on each well day . Every thorough pack is an artificial fit of chills and fever . When you go into the sheet , you have the cold stage ; you re-act , heat accumulates , and you have the hot , or fever stage , and then comes the final stage of perspiration . This is nature 's mode of cure . Every pack expels so much disease . By giving a rapid succession of packs , you may cure any ordinary case in from one to three weeks . When the stomach is disordered , give tepid water emetics , and do not fail to move the bowels with daily injections . Did. ? The less the patient eats the better , and the less he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole force of the system should be used to expel the disease . Bilious Remittent Fever is , I believe , caused by the malaria of intermittent , combined with other malaria and personal causes of disease . It is a fever of remissions and exacerbations ; but there is no entire freedom from its symptoms , as in fever and ague . It commences with or without a chill ; followed by  | languor , weariness , uneasiness of stomach , pains in head , back , and limbs ; then a hot , dry skin ; full , bounding pulse , abrupt and frequent ; restlessness , vomiting , thirst ; tongue turns from white to yellow or brown ; bowels constipated ; stools green and acrid ; severe stage lasts twelve to eighteen hours . This period usually comes on a little before noon . As the disease goes on , the vomiting becomes more frequent ; there is heat and tenderness at the epigastrium , intolerable headache , and intolerance of light . The tongue becomes black , dries and cracks ; respiration difficult ; pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seven to thirteen days . Often it sinks into a low stage , and lasts twenty or thirty days . In Malignant Remittent , a severe form , or occurring in more poisoned and exhausted constitutions , the skin is cold and clammy ; countenance pale , livid , and shrunk ; pulse frequent and fluttering ; stupor , or low delirium ; syncope . Sometimes fatal in two or three days . Effects. ? As usually treated by bleeding and enoti , mous doses of calomel and quinine , this disease is followed by jaundice , dyspepsia , enlargements of liver , spleen , etc. , dropsy , consumption . Treatment. ? Cold water is the only reliable remedy . Even Professor Dickson , an allopath , says , " its remedial value can not be exaggerated . " Called to a severe case , I should try to give the patient a cool half-bath of twenty minutes ' duration , with cold water to the head . If the stomach were disturbed , a water emetic . Then a thorough injection . As the fever came on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repeated as often . Cool water to drink , cool injections to the bowels , cold compresses upon the head , the wet-sheet pack , frequent , according to the violence of the fever ; these are our means of cure , and carefully adapted to the necessities of each case , and the strength of  | each patient , they are sufficient to cure every curable case . Diet. ? Water , until the disease is conqueled , then toast-water for a few days , and , very carefully , and in the smallest quantities , ripe fruit and farinaceous food . An indulgence in the cravings of the appetite , during recovery , is very dangerous . The stomach and bowels are so weak and irritable , that a single improper meal may be followed by fatal consequences . Simple Continued Fever. ? This name is given to a fever arising from the ordinary causes , and having no peculiar local determination . It often begins with chill , then pain , languor , and feverishness . It may be slight and brief , or severe and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the power of the system to expel it . If there is little matter of disease , and much vital energy , the fever will neither be long nor violent . If much disease and much energy , it will be violent , but short . It may also be a mild , slow fever , or a low and protracted one . In this case we call it typhus , and it may become malignant and contagious . The Treatment. ? Most fevers terminate in health . The diseasing matter is burned up and expelled , and the freed organism goes on with its functions . But we can guide and hasten this process . In all fevers , as in all diseases , we must surround the patient with the conditions of health . He must have pure air , cleanliness , and quiet ; soft water to drink , ad libitum ; the stomach should be thoroughly cleansed at the beginning , and the bowels washed clean at least once a day by a full injection . If the matter is acrid , twice a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first with soap and tepid water . Use the wet-sheet pack as often and as long as the patient requires . If the fever is high , the packs may be short and more frequent . Sponging the whole surface , at intervals between the  | packs , is pleasant and useful . Fever is a fire , it is said , which we must put out . Not so ; it is only an increase of a fire which is always burning . We must regulate this fire , and aid it in doing its work ; and the more we wash away , the less there will be to burn . Diet. ? No fever patient has any business with food . Gruels and toast-water , rice-water , barley-water , broths , and all the slops of the sick room must be left out of it . A little lemonade is all that is allowable ; and pure water is better than this . There is not the least danger in any sick person going a few days , and in the early stages of fever , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat with caution , and eat and live , in all respects , so as not to have another fever . Typhus Fever of the mild kind , commonly called nervous fever , appears to be only simple fever with great nervous exhaustion . It is a fever of low type and slow progress ; the determination to the skin is manifested in eruptions ? minute , rose-coloured , chiefly about the chest .. Later , eruptions like flea-bites are seen . In bad cases , toward the end of the second week , the patient sinks into great weakness , with tremors , picking of the bed-clothes , rapid pulse , red , dry tongue , dark mucous matter around the teeth , gloom and anxiety , low delirium , coma , brief convulsions , death . The severer form of typhus , called Putrid Fever , Tail Fever , Ship Fever , is epidemic and contagious . It is marked by alternations of heat and cold ; hot , dry , harsh skin ; distress ; face turgid and dark , red flush , eyes heavy and red ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent , irregular ; tongue coated with brown or yellowish fur ; nausea and retching ; bowels torpid . In three or four days the tongue becomes clean , dark , red , smooth , dry , cracked ; sordes around teeth ; pulse small and rapid ; hurried respiration , or slow and laboured ; foetid breath ; eruption on the skin ;
