stupid , and now that Repeal was on , his organization would be in trouble . Nobody outside the North End would deal with Cosolimo if he did n't have to . Now that liquor would be available legally , Cosolimo would be shortsheeted . But that would mean simply a major power strugglein the Italian underworld , not the end of it . Brady reminded himself to check on Anselmo . He had arranged for two special guards to be with him at all times . He might have to make further provisions for Anselmo 's security now . Cosolimo wanted Anselmo dead desperately . Brady would continue to protect him because Anselmo had earned it . When Zorelli killed Jer MacCurtain , he might as well have killed Brady himself ; that was how intensely he felt the hurt and rage . Anselmo had avenged MacCurtain . More than that , because Anselmo had killed Zorelli , Brady did not have to , and he did n't have to kill Anselmo . He was grateful for that , immeasurably so , not only because such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and for his family , but because Brady revolted at the thought of killing a man . He was older . He was old enough even to regret his own acts of killing in Ireland , that they had been necessary . So Brady was determined to see that Anselmo did not die in jail . It was the least he could do . And  --  owing to the fact that the Superior Court was a Yankee stronghold and well beyond Curley'sinfluence and therefore Brady 's  --  it was also the most he could do . Curley had been talking about having a great bash for party workers when Repeal came through . Brady hoped the mayor had n't done anything about it , and certainly not for that night . Who 'd have guessed the Mormonsin Utah would have put Repeal over ? Brady hated to be caught unaware , and if Curley threw a party that got out of hand it would be one more embarrassment . A public display of drunkenness by Curley and his crew would give the State House biddies just the opening they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at times . . . " Jesus ! " Brady said , swerving the car onto the road 's shoulder as a huge yellow Packard with flamboyant chrome fixtures roared down on him from behind . He had seen a like car that afternoon in that yard on the hill by the mock-Tudor house . Madeline Thomson ! Blind and peed ! Rushing after him , to hurl his ax at him , to force the pathetic tree on him , to flash her outrage at him . Tough shit , Lady ! Morning wears to evening and hearts break . Leaves of grass and all that . All things doomed to die touch the heart . Including , the first lust of winter . Go home to your husband ! Celebrate Repeal ! ( yet blasted ! Read Joyce ! Rejoice .

There were three or four people waving bottles at each other and the world . " Hoompa ! Hoompa ! " the horn went , celebrating legal liver disease . Not Madeline Thomson . He 'd seen the last of her . What did it matter ? He looked over at Collins , who was frightened by their close call with the other car . He loved the kid . Why did the world feel empty ? IT SEEMED as if no one could get a drink in Boston . Trucks and drays loaded with freshly distilled liquor and recently imported wines and brandieshad been held in the huge warehouses on the waterfront in preparation for the moment they could legally be delivered to hotels and clubs . But their cheerful shipment had been delayed by mysterious accidents . Truck tires had been flattened . Warehouse locks had been changed and no one seemed able to open them . Several teams of draft horses had been cruellyslaughtered . As word spread through the city that the Twenty-first Amendment had been ratified at last , liquor entrepreneurs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold stroke for weeks . The warehouse men , the dock bosses , the teamsters , and even the customs agents who had observed the unloading of the liquor were all his . The hundreds of newly licensed retailers would have to deal with him if they wanted stock on their shelves . Though most of them had already paid for their orders , when they arrived on the waterfront to take delivery they were informed that , through strange coincidences , the only shipments available were those of holders of long-term contracts with a new firm , Rosa Imports . The Rosa Imports office in the old Seaman 's Building on Atlantic Avenuecould process such contracts in a matter of moments . Some retailers Objected and tried to bypass Cosolimo 's agents . Theirs were the trucks sabotaged and horses slain . At least one tavern owner , an Irishman from Charlestown , was beaten badly . By the early evening of the day that Repeal took effect , Rosa Imports had contracted to be the exclusive supplierof spirits and wines for over two hundred hotels and clubs.  |p202Curley  's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from City Hall . Hundreds of revelers squeezed into the cellar Grill Room , anxious to toast John Barleycorn . For them the occasion was the Irish-American equivalent of Bastille Day . The Puritan Wave had been turned back . Never again would the grim Roundhead morality of the Reformation imposeitself on the merry conviviality of Desmonds , Reillys , and O'Connors . America was theirs at last , and fully . " Do you know why Protestants are forbidden to make love standing up ? " A young red-faced drunk asked the gang . His circle of companions listened expectantly . " Because people might think they 're dancing ! " Everyone laughed . " Where the hell is the champagne ? " someone yelled at the bartender . " Not here yet , " the stout dispenser replied . He was handing over mugs full of the same old bootleg beer that speakeasies had been serving for years . " I hate this swill ! " another cried , as he poured his beer on the floor . Someone offered him a silver flask . " Try this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On my thumb , " the benefactor replied , holding up his hand . The thumbnail test ; pour it on your thumb . If the nail does n't come off , the stuff is safe to drink . Curley and Brady were down the corridor from the bistro in the hotel barbershop , where they had repaired for a sudden meeting with Pete Malloy , the bar manager , who had just come up from the waterfront . Curley 's frame was draped like a barber 's sheet across a reclining chair . " That wop bastard has the whole place tied up , " Malloy concluded . " That 's why we have n't had the champagne or the imported stuff . " " The boys out front wo n't settle for the near-beer much longer , " Curley said . " That 's beside the point , Jim , " Brady said . " We ca n't let Cosolimo pull this off . " " What do you propose ? " Malloy asked , exasperated and angry . " He alreadydid pull it off . Everybody signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , I did , Brady ! Shit ! I ca n't wait weeks or months for the stuff . What am I supposed to do ? Serve grain alcohol with juniper drops ?

Why do n't you do something about that bastard ? "  | " Presumably , Pete , " Curley said , " his contracts are legal now too . You already did something . " " Oh , Christ ! " Malloy stormed out of the barbershop . Curley and Brady stared after him . Finally the mayor said , " I want a brilliant idea from you , Brady . " " I 'm not a tidy-minded man , Mayor . You wo n't like what I 'm thinking . " " Where 's Jerry MacCurtain now that I need him ? All my best fellows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mayor had a grander past than future . For once the man looked old .

Tell me what you 're thinking . " " It 's a fool 's thought . If we iced Cosolimo he 'd only be replaced by another one . You have to find a way to work with him . " " Not after what he did . Never . " " Anselmo . " " We ca n't touch him . You know that . " " We can keep him alive . A little patience is what we need . " Curley reached down below the armrest of the barber 's chair and unhookedthe leather strap and slapped it viciously across his own lap . Its sharp report startled Brady . The sudden pain through his legs purged the mayor of his emotion . " The swine ! " he said , " The dago swine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his eyes drift along the shelf below the smart mirror which held dozens of long-necked bottles of tonic and cologne . " You know , Colman , I 've always thought a barbershop is the most evil-smelling place in the world . " Brady laughed . He was aware of his own image in the mirror when he said , " Getting your hair cut 's like going to confession . A messy business , but you feel clean as a penny after . " " I would n't let them priests at me with a razor , I 'll tell you . " " Why , Mayor ! " Brady loved Curley 's faint irreverence . Curley reclined like a Roman senator , lifted his shoes slightly to study them . " You know what I need ? " A queasy feeling unfolded itself in Brady . " I need a shine , that 's what . " It was typical of Curley  --  so vast his need for victories  --  that when laced with an intractable opponent he turned on his nearest ally . Jamesp204Michael Curley fed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies ; he would settle for the humiliation of his friends . Brady knew this was no mere impulse of egomania . It was the mayor 's carefully nurturedtechnique for maintaining his massive , solitary preeminence . His proteges and pretenders and potential successors were systematically skewered on his cruel wit . Brady knew that once the mayor perceived him as a future rival he was finished . He had developed a technique of his own , a counterfeit subserviencecombined with a steady resourcefulness that made him too valuable to discard . Brady 's effort was continually to show Curley how useful he was , but Brady knew that his position was safest when the mayor felt enormously threatened by his great enemy , the old Boston Protestant . When Curley was riding high , unthreatened , he was dangerous to Brady . The mayor was turning his shoes this way and that . Brady was thinking that what he needed was a new draft of the old bitternessfor Curley to drink . Booze would do for starters . " Let 's have a drink with the boys , Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you like me to shine your shoes for you , Mayor ? " Brady was jovial and direct . By so raising the bet on Curley , by articulating and accepting the taunt , he defused it . Curley could only treat Brady 's offer like a joke . Finally , it would demean him to have a shoeshiner for an aide . He laughed , flung himself out of the chair , and slapped Brady on the shoulder . " I could n't afford your price , Colman ! Let 's make some whoopee ! What do you say ? " In the Grill Room everything was yells and grunts of pleasure . The ransomed champagne had arrived and was being splashed around the room in small silvery fountains as the bottles were gaily emptied . When Curley and Brady entered the room they were cheered and hailed . Quickened by that spirit , the mayor grabbed a magnum and started to pour , instantly dominating the scene as if he himself had promulgated Repeal . When the bottle was empty Colman Brady put a glass in Curley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great show . Then Brady replaced it with a fresh glass and watched him throw it down to the cheers of delirious men and women . Brady waited the way one waits at the pump for the priming to catch . When the mayor had the fiery , gleaming look , Brady knew the intoxicant was having its effect  --  not the champagne , the crowd . Brady made his way to a corner of the bar . He lit one of his thin cigars and held the flame of the match for a moment before blowing it out . He recalled a trick of street Gypsies in Dublin who , on summer evenings , went up and down O'Connell Streetp205spewing petrol out of their mouths over hand-held torches which ignited the liquid spray and made them seem to be spitting great sheets of fire . Then they collected ha'pennies from the wonderstruck . Brady rememberedthinking they would be dead soon , not from the fire , but from the gas they swallowed . Danger is often other than what it seems to be . He blew out the match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colman ? " Pete Malloy said from his place behind the bar . He was holding a bottle over a glass . " Indeed , Peter ! Indeed ! Merci ! " Colman took the glass , toasted Malloy with a glad eye , and sipped . Though the room was packed , people kept arriving , and the pitch of the celebration rose steadily . Den O'Coole forced his way to the bar and joined Colman . He was already blasted . A two-day growth of beard gave his face a mildewed pallor . He wore a cap cockeyed and carried an empty fifth . He clapped Colman on the back . " The Great God is good and just , Colman ; the Great God is good and just ! " Brady , assuming a bleary drunkenness , embraced O'Coole . " Aw , it 's a grand , grand day , Den , ai n't it ? " " Oh , Colman , my friend ! " " O'Coole , my buggering battledog ! " " Colman ! Colman ! " O'Coole hissed in a great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung in effigy over at the hall . " " What , an effigy ? " " Indeed ! Strung him right up , we did ! Me and Houlie ! " " Oh , Den , you should n't of done that ! " " Why not ? " Offense and anger flashed in the drunk . " You should have drowned him ! Drowned him ! Been more fitting ! " " Christ , you 're right ! Drowning , oh . . . " Oh , they 'd made a mistake . " . . . but . . . " He looked mystified . " Where could we have drowned him ? " " Why , where he was born ! Beacon Street ! At the lake in the Garden . The Public Gardens at the far end of the Boston Common was a privatelyendowed park with an elegant swan lake and perfect lawns and shrubbery that were tended by a score of gardeners . Bordered by Beacon Street and Arlington , it was the preserve of Beacon Hill and the Back Ray , whose ladies regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're right ! We should of drowned the old bastard there ! " " It 's never too late , Den ! Never too late ! Why the mayor himself would love to put the old coot under with his own hands , I 'll bet you ! " " I could go get it ! "  | " Good idea ! We 'll have a parade ! " " Oh , a parade ! With everybody ! Do n't go away ! I 'll go get it ! " " Absolutely ! " O'Coole staggered under a sudden dizziness as he pushed away from the bar . " Ooh ! The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . " " You can do it , Den . " Brady supported him for a minute . " O000h . I do n't feel . . . " O'Coole shook himself , and with a practicedact of will stiffened his legs and assumed a rigid posture . He looked at Colman , slightly penitent . " I 'm partially drunk , you know . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " I know you are , Den . All the better . You can do it . " " I can indeed ! I 'll be back ! " He took a dramatic breath and pushed his way through the bodies toward the door . Brady watched him go and then let his gaze linger on the crowd . He was calculating its potential for rowdiness . A man in a purple shirt with his tie askew was standing on a table and trying to negotiatea tune out of a banjo . Jack Lynch was squatting cross-legged on top of the piano in the corner , having failed miserably at the cossack dance , and now trying only to maintain his balance . A bald fellow was waving an empty bottle at Berkie Clyde , the piano player  --  a conductor'swand with which he beat time much too slowly . Kitty Regan , with peacock feathers in her hair , sat on the edge of the mantelpiece over the huge fireplace swinging her leg while staring at herself in a hand-held mirror . A couple whose heads came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in a burnished silk gown that displayed her breasts was dancing with her champagne glass . A man on a chair was pouring wine on all the heads he could reach . The mayor was surrounded by a coterie of men who were laughing uproariously . Curley 's potential for rowdiness was , as usual , enormous . Good , Brady thought . He turned back to his champagne and leaned over the bar to sip it . When he brought his eyes up they went automatically to the gilt mirror behind the bar in which they met , as if by appointment , the eyes of Mary Ellen Shields . He had n't seen her in his survey of the Grill Room because she was at the bar too , separated from him by half a dozen revelers . They stared at each other . Brady thought of Madeline Thomson , and the afternoon 's surge of desire came back to him . It seemed like years , not hours , since he had stood opposite her in the mansion on the hill . He raised his glass at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He studied her . She was smoking a cigarette , flamboyantly . He imagined her practicing her flourish with it in her room . She wore a knee-length silver satin frock thatp207clung to her figure like lacquer and gave her a frank beauty that he had not seen before . Against the smoky tumult of rough and ugly characters , she seemed enormously delicate . There was a dangling vulnerability in the way she was looking at him . The question was who would move toward whom . He hesitated . She dropped her eyes . Was she with someone ? Of course she was , but whom ? Ben Ricketts probably . Brady saw him several yards past Mary Ellen . He was waggling a forefinger at his opponent in an argument . Brady slid through the clinking drinkers to join her . " You 've cut your hair , " he said . She was wearing it extremely short like some film star . " Enter the ghost , " she said , a little drunkenly . " Not without an invitation : " He raised his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror . " Still a proper gentleman , Mr. Brady , I see . " " Do n't you know . " He bowed slightly . " What ? I ca n't hear you . " Brady smiled at her . Something lusty and desirous in him showed itself . Mary Ellen put her cigarette out in a dish on the bar . In doing so she stained her fingers with ash . She put her fingertips to her mouth and licked them . Brady watched the spittle bead on her lips . " You seem , " he said , " lean and sad . " He could tell she was not wearingunderwear . " And you seem sober . " " I am . " " Then you 've not the excuse I have . " " What excuse ? " " For going off with you . Tonight . " She drained her glass and reached for another at her elbow . It was half Dull and someone else 's . " Hey , dearie , " the bloke behind her said ; " no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and with the other circled her waist . He moved in on her neck with an amorous tongue . Mary Ellen pulled away from him and hit him just below the eye with Iicr fist , a manly blow which so stunned the fellow that he simply turned his back on her and drunkenly complained to his companions . Brady had never seen such winsome fierceness in her . She turned to him With a whore 's cockiness . " Well ? "  | " Well . . . love absorbs my ardent soul . " " Oh , you bastard . " She dropped her head onto her hands . " You 're mocking me . " " No , I 'm not , Mary Ellen . I 'm mocking myself . " " Dreck ! " He knew she was right . She was ahead of him . Madeline Thomson had been ahead of him . He was too sober . He could see the scene in the morning , how he 'd hate waking up with her in the bed , how she 'd look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She would accusehim of having taken advantage of her drunken state . Well , what the hell . He put his hand inside his vest , posing . " Mary Ellen , it 's just that Ihave n't forgotten what we had . I did n't want to make light of it . " " It is fate , Colman . Not you or me . Fate . " She was posing too . Well , what the hell . " Here 's to fate , then . " He sipped and then handed his glass to her . She downed it . When she put the glass down , she was suddenly unsteady . Her eyes were watery . " I have to go to the jakes . " She looked awkwardly around the room . " It 's over there , through those doors . " " Oh , " she said , a note of panic . She moved away from him , steering through the bar like a wounded bird through trees . A few minutes later a great commotion could be heard from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an animal , a moose calling a mate or something . It took Brady a moment to realize it was Den O'Coole . So Curley wanted Colman Brady to shine his shoes , did he ? The hell with that ! Brady was startled at his sudden pique . The bastard had hurt him in the barbershop by taunting him exactly where he felt vulnerable . Ever since Michael Collins had coaxed him out of Four Mile Water , Brady 's dread had been to wake up old having spent his life carrying somebody else 's bags , shining  --  exactly !  --  somebody else 's shoes . Brady 's love for Curley , his devotion to him , was familiar . What he was beginning to discover was his hate . Shine the bastard 's shoes ? Not by a long shot . Brady would be wearing them before Curley knew they were gone . But first things first . If Curley was at the head of a drunken outrageous mob , old Boston would go after him again . And Curley would not be ridingquite so high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through the crowd , which by now was a swaying and stagger/ing mass , crossed to the piano , and leaned over Berkie Clyde . He told him to play a bouncy tune as loud as he could , and then he grabbed the hands of those nearest and began to lead them in a dancing circle . Quickly others wanted to join , and as they broke in , Brady led the circle out of itself and into a kind of snake dance . Glasses were dropped and broken , chairs shoved aside , and tables rocked as men and women locked hands and kicked their feet to the music . Brady steered the line to Curley , who grabbed on and , like that , was leading the dance . By then the knot at the door were chanting , " Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown the old bastard ! Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown the old bastard ! " Den O'Coole and two others held up a pathetic scarecrow . A sign pinned to its chest read " Prohibition . " The dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Drown him ! Drown the old bastard ! " The snake wound around and around the Grill Room , bouncing and twisting like a giant boa . " Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown him in the Gardens ! Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown the old bastard ! Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown him in the Garden ! " Soon the snake was out on Tremont Street headed for the Common . A light snow was falling . Revelers in cars honked goodnaturedly for a block , but then the streets were quiet except for the chanters as they moved toward Park Street , where everything was still . At the corner of Park and Tremont the snake dancers let out wild hoots at the Park Street Church , the steeple of which stabbed at God , and the pastor of which , the Reverend Horace Miffleton , was a great defender of Prohibition and a fierce attacker of what he labeled the " excesses of our poor immigrants . " Someone threw a rock through one of the church 's large smoked windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently , indifferent to the affront . " Where did everybody go ? " Mary Ellen Shields said . She had come out of the bathroom to find the Grill Room empty and wrecked . Someone was passed out by the fireplace . Malloy , the bartender , was dragging another drunk toward the door . Colman Brady was alone at the bar , smoking and sipping his drink . He had assumed she was gone . She was standing across the room , touching a table with her fingertips , steadying herself . " They went to drown the old Yankee . " " What ? " " They 're dancing in the streets . " " Oh . " " You could catch up with them . " She shook her head and crossed the room . She concentrated on herp210walking ; left foot down , right foot . Left . Right . Passing tables , she touched them . When she drew alongside Brady , she held her figure with proud erectness , but the expression on her face was pure misery . " I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stale glass of champagne . She sipped it . He smiled at her . " Never , " she repeated . " Every pleasure has its price . " " Colman , " she said , " I love you . " " I know it , Mary Ellen . " He took her in his arms and held her for a long time before they separatedenough to find each other 's lips . " Shall we stay together ? " he asked when they separated again . " Yes . Where ? " " Here . Upstairs . I 'll get a room . " " All right . " " Are you sober ? " " Of course not . Do you think I 'd open myself again to this if I was ? " " No . " " Colman , sobriety like yours is a luxury some of us ca n't afford . " " I pay for the way I am , darling . " " So do I , darling . For the way you are . " By the time Brady and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their keg tapped . They had woven an arabesque up the middle of Park Street past the State House and down Beacon . They went along weaving and unweaving , twirling each other , passing bottles , singing " There is a tavern in the town , " chanting , " Drown him ! Drown him ! Drown the old bastard ! " The drunken mob stormed past the darkened row houses  --  the Union Club , the Parkman house , the Cabot house , then , across Joy Street , the Women 's City Club , the Somerset Club , the third Harrison Gray Otis mansion , the King 's Chapel Church House and Rectory , the Thayer house , and the Sears mansion . The revelers danced into the Public Gardenand across the snow-brushed lawns and through the shrubbery and in and out of the flower beds , which had been elaborately mulched and coveredfor the winter . James Michael Curley presided over the execution of " Prohibition . " From the center of the footbridge that crossed the swan lake , he delivered his eulogy . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tried to take away ! In this great country of ours you deny the inalienable rights of the people at your peril . They tried to keep our stomachs empty , and withp211FDR 's New Deal we 've put an end to that ! They tried to keep our throats dry and we 've put an end to that ! " The crowd cheered . Curley seized the effigy of Old Man Prohibition from O'Coole and held it up high overhead and out from the railing of the bridge . In his loudest voice he declared , " Faretheewell , you old bastard , for we must leave thee ! There is a tavern in old Beantown ! " With that Curley hurled the scarecrow in a high arch off the bridge . The people started to cheer . But suddenly they stopped . The dummy hit the surface of the pond , but it was solid . The water was frozen and the ice held . Old Man Prohibition sprawled disjointedly below them . Was it an omen ? Prohibition refused to go under . Curley gawked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head was fogging up . He had spent the last of his sobriety on the eulogy . He waited dumbly with the others for something to happen . Steve Mulligan broke the ice . He hurled himself from the bridge to do it , and landed squarely on top of the old man . The cheers went up . Steve 's girl , Florry Joyce , hoisted herself carefully over the railing and then dropped the ten feet into the water . The ice gave under her , but she banged her buttocks on the bottom of the pond . The water was less than four feet deep . When the boys saw the girl go in , they all knew it was either follow her or slink away in shame . And so two dozen giddy if not quite eager lads jumped into the pond . The shock of the water had a similar effect on all of them . They were instantly panting and choking with horror at the cold , with which they coped by jumping on each other and frantically dancing about in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers on the bridge . More young women followed . Soon thirty-two men and seven women were cavorting about in the freezing water . In the jumping and tugging and splashing and hugging the girl who wore the burnished silk gown lost it . She was nude only for the moment or two it took a gentleman to cover her with his soaked coat , but later the city would believe that she and others had danced about the pond and Public Garden unclothed for hours . As if it were summer . As if they were not Catholics . A cry went up for His Honor . The aqua-dancers wanted him to join them . How gloriously they would have received him !  |p212But  the mayor was gone . He was not so drunk that he did n't understand what had happened and what it would mean . Shortly after the mayor left , the police arrived . With the police came photographers . The next morning Mary Ellen woke before Colman did . He was in the crease of her arms . His cheek rested on the swell of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . Their room opened on an airshaft , and it was impossible to tell whether the sun was high in the sky yet or not .

She could smell the hotel kitchen . The odor of bread . Parker House rolls . Colman opened his eyes . She nodded down to kiss him on the brow . " You know what you are ? " she asked softly . He looked toward her , trying to find the focus . It crossed Mary Ellen 's mind that he might not remember her name . She would die . " You are my Parker House roll .

"  --  she ran her finger in small circles on his chest  --  " . . . if we stayed this way forever , that 'd be some hotel bill . " But they were both past joking . Mary Ellen accomplished a horizontal shrug and then , keeping the sheet about her , rolled away from him and out of the bed . She picked up her dress and stockings and went into the bathroom to dress . A few minutes later they went down to the hotel lobby , but separately . As Colman was walking away from the desk , having paid the bill , he saw the stack of morning Heralds outside the grilled-over tobacconist 's . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel in its place .

" He ca n't do it ! He ca n't do it ! " " He already has , " Brady said , gesturing with the folder he held . It was a copy of the bill . The week after Curley 's gang drowned Prohibition , Wysten Waverly Otis , Speaker of the House , brought a bill out of the Commonwealth Committee to revise the Boston Charter .

This is my city ! The people wo n't stand for it . They 've got the whole rest of the state , those chowderheads ! What do they want ? " " They want you , Jim . They want you dead . Politically dead . " Curley submitted to the realization . A new charter . A new law . He would not be mayor forever . Brady watched his obstinacy evaporate . Curley slumped back in his chair looking old and defeated . Brady 's own skepticism about the man , his detached private feelings of disdain for him  --  these evaporated too . The bill that he held in his hand loosed the more permanent feeling ; an enemy was doing this to us . " Shit on Otis ! " Curley repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bacon , of course . And Cabot . " " That old coot . " " No , the young one . And Governor Ely has called it a much needed reform . ' " " That thief . " There was a moment 's silence . Then Curley said , " I got a hint or two from Washington , you know . " " I know . " Curley , who had backed Roosevelt over Smith the year before , had been mentioned for a variety of third-level federal appointments . " He offered me London , you know . " Brady knew that Roosevelt had done no such thing . The thought of Curley in the Court of St. James was laughable , even to Brady . It was well known that Curley had been offered the post of Ambassador to Poland . " If it 's such an important job , Mr. President , " the affronted mayor had said in response to Roosevelt 's slick pitch , " you take it ! " Still it was true that Curley had his seat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its steam . Brady thought about that . It was also true that Massachusetts was in the lowest circle of the Depression . The largest industry in the state was charity . Hundreds of thousands of workers were unemployed and on relief . Brady thought about that . " What are you thinking about ? " Curley asked . " I 'm thinking . . . " Brady paused . This was the moment he 'd been waiting for . Brady had his own purposes for the suggestion he was making , but they would coincide , finally , with Curley's. " . . . you ought to run for governor . " Curley looked at Brady impassively , showing nothing . The State f lousep215was the Brahmin stronghold . For an Irishman like Curley it would be the ultimate windmill . That he should run for governor was unthinkable . It was one thing to dominate a city of immigrants like Boston . The reaches of the state were populated by conservative nativists , were n't they ? Besides , Democrats outside Boston had gone for Al Smith three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of Roosevelt as a betrayal to Irish Catholic aspirations , did n't they ? But still . But still . Roosevelt 's power and prestige were enormous after the Hundred Days . " I could run on the New Deal , " Curley said tentatively . Brady had to stifle the tremor he felt . He knew that Curley was going to bite . Colman Brady had learned that James Michael Curley was a sucker for the show of power . He would , to spite Otis and to glorify his own huge ego , trade in the mayor 's job without fighting for it to make a dash for governor just when the NRA welfare giveaways were going to make the mayor 's office the most powerful in the state . But that was Curley ; better the appearance than the substance . Brady wondered if it was an Irish flaw . Michael Collins had risked his life to display a power he did n't have . And the display had killed him . Colman Brady wanted in this regard to be more like Lowell , more like Anselmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the mayor 's chair happily . " Righto , " Brady said . " And you know who the Republicans are running . " " Bacon . " Brady nodded and smiled . They were onto something . Gaspar Griswold Bacon epitomized the Brahmin aristocracy , whoawned the banks and who were terrified by what they regarded as thedeadly ' socialism of Roosevelt . " I 've never won outside the old neighborhoods . " " You won in Puerto Rico . " Curley snorted . When Massachusetts Democrats went for Smith in 1931 , he had arranged to attend the National Convention as an alternate for Roosevelt from Puerto Rico . He had introduced himself to the throng as Jaime Miguel Curleo . They had loved him . Roosevelt had embraced him on the platform . " Besides , " Brady went on , " the old neighborhoods are everywhere now . " " Goddamn it , Colman , you 're right ! " Curley slammed an open palm down on his desk . " Shit on Otis ! We 'll do it ! " The moment Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his officeand made his announcement . The General Court rocked with laughter . Editorial writers and pundits advised him to retire with dignity.  |p216Curley  's own constituency in the city of Boston were surprised and skeptical . But James Michael Curley had an infallible instinct for the plight of the unemployed , and his ability to articulate their experience and to offer them hope did not fail him . Curley found , as Brady 'd expected he would , that he had an enormous statewide base in the disenfranchised  --  the unemployment rate hovered at twenty-two percent through 1933 and 1934  --  and he exploited it expertly with the simple slogan of his campaign : " Work and wages for all . " He threw himself into the fray with a fierceness that was rough-edged and merciless even for him . He took full advantage of the fact that , under Roosevelt , his own long-held philosophy of positive government that provided tangible benefits for voters , particularly jobs , was being vindicated . As a spokesman and advocate for the recently created Federal Emergency Relief and Civil Works administrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over unemployment , and he could convincingly promise the voters that with him as governor , Massachusettswould be a favored beneficiary of federal programs . Brady supportedhim in that conviction , though privately he doubted it . On the stump he was magnificent , striking great poses that would have seemed pompous and conceited on anyone else . He habitually referred to himself in the third person , as if he were himself a detached arbiter in the momentous conflict between " the people 's champion " and the established powers of the Commonwealth . He said , typically , " The Republican hatchet men referring to Curley said , ' A leopard never changes its spots . ' Well , let Curley say to that that where he found a mud flat , there he left a playground ! Where he found rotten pilings there he left a great harbor and the largest pier in America ! Where he found dilapidated tenements , there he left a housing project . Where he found disease and dying children , there he left health clinics and the free Boston City Hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He will not change them , but multiply them ! " They heard him and they loved him . In Lowell , in Lawrence , New Bedford , Maynard , Fitchburg , Housatonic , Fall River  --  the milltowns whose industry had deserted for cheap labor elsewhere . In Haverhill , Lynn , Brockton , Newbury , Norwood  --  the shoe centers whose bosses had beaten back the unions and were exploiting the Depression cruelly . In Pittsfield , Worcester , and Springfield , where enormous factories seven or eight stories high and covering three or four blocks and with great unsmokingchimneys dominated everyone 's consciousness by their very idleness . Signs on vacant stores read , " For Rent  --  at your own price . "  |p217In  1934 even breadlines were going out of business . Soup kitchens were serving dark water . Desolate streets lined with weathered old wooden houses , unoccupied , uncared for , their windows broken , cut through every faded industry town in the state . Barbershops were closed ; their cane poles were flaked and washed out because people cut their hair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no heels , in frayed overcoats split in the back , wearing old shirts for scarfs , leaned against walls and lampposts . They would wince and walk jerkily away if someone offered to help . The winter of 1934 was the most viciously cold anyone could remember . There were no coins for the gas heaters . The pathetic men on the corners swung their arms for warmth and for something to do . These were James Michael Curley 's people . He could walk among them and , where others saw only zombies , men worn out and utterly lacking in personality or human force ; where others saw the living dead , Curley saw a last spark of life  --  it was anger  --  and could flame it . " You are not the shiftless , the ne'er-do-wells , the immoral ones , " he preached , knowing they felt otherwise . " The greed for higher and higher profits by the Lawrences and the Lowells and the Cabots and the Bacons  --  that is shiftless ! That is immorality ! " When the despaired , stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means to have a wife and kids and no work and no money and be in debt , " his eyes would fill and he would pipe , " But I do ! I do ! I 've been there too ! " They knew he was lying and yet they believed him . There were vast numbers of them . Four years of Depression had conqueredthe savings , the scruples , and the self-respect of hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth citizens . They were " on relief . " They and all their relations and most of their neighbors would vote for Curley for governor . " Work and wages for all ! " He knew what they needed if they were to live . He and Roosevelt would save them . Brady suspected that among the reasons Franklin D. Roosevelt had for wanting Curley in the State House was the knowledge that there Curley would be removed from direct and unchecked access to the vast federal monies that were beginning to pour into cities , towns , and counties  --  and less into states themselves . Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President regarded Curley as a petty thief . If the office of governor was lacking in fiscal power when compared to the offices of big-city mayors in the New Deal era , still its cultural and mythic power in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was enormous , and that was what Brady had counted on . The trappings of the office would draw Curley as the siren draws heroes.  |p218For  most of Harvard 's history , for example , the governor of the Commonwealthhad been an ex officio member of the Harvard Board of Overseers . That was no longer the case , but the governor still occupied places of honor in the inner circles of many of Boston 's most prestigious institutions . He was automatically a member of the Board of Overseers of the Union Club . He was a trustee of the University of Massachusetts , the Lowell Institute , the Athenaeum , the Gardner Museum , the Symphony Orchestra , and the Massachusetts Society for the Preservation of Antiquities . The governor of the Commonwealth , since the seventeenth century , was an officialis at the annual commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the L.L.D . from Harvard were traditionallyawarded an honorary degree . And in 1936 the governor of Massachusettscould expect to play a central role in the Tercentenary Celebrationof the college . Beginning on November 13 , 1934 , the governor-elect of Massachusetts was James Michael Curley . On November 14 , the Union Club 's Board of Overseers , including the outgoing governor , Joseph B. Ely , met and unanimously adopted a new charter . It was to take effect on January 1 , 1935 , the date the new governorwould take office . He would do so without benefit of membership in the Union Club . No one was surprised . But on January 2 everyone was surprised because on that day Curley announced his first appointments , and three of the most important jobs in the Commonwealth went to aristocratic Republican reformers . Only a short time later would it be understood what Curley had done . A governor in Massachusetts served only a two-year term , but the major policymakers , the so-called Governor 's Council , served five- or seven-year terms . " A relic of royalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council was a carryover from the colonial system and a deliberate check on the governor 's power . An independently elected body , it had the power to approve or deny all appointments , pardons , and Commonwealth contracts . When he took office Curley discovered that the council was solidly aligned against him by a seven-to-two Republican majority . The three Republicans appointed to major positions were among that seven . Only after they had resigned their seats on the council did it become clear that Curley intended to take advantage of an obscure provisionin the constitution to bypass new council elections and fill the vacanciesby executive order . Immediately Curley reversed the majority on the council to five-to-four in his own favor . There was a predictable uproar from Republicans and the press . The Speaker of the House , Wysten Waverly Otis , denounced Curley and accused him of having " destroyed the people 's barrier . "  |p219Curley  said in the hearing of reporters , " Shit on Otis ! " and he laughed raucously . Among the appointed executive councilors was Colman Brady . He accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston . As Curley 's term got under way and the novelty of his being governor faded , Brady worked diligently at establishing his own network of loyal pols . He was determined that his performance in his first public office would be of high quality . By the end of the first year he had a reputation as a tough , fair-minded , and vigorous advocate of the city 's interests before the General Court . During the second year of the term , while Curley 's fortunes entered an apparent decline , Brady , it seemed , was coming into his own . The press watched him carefully and increasingly sought out his views on a range of policy questions . The Republicans thought him more consistent and able than his mentor , and for that reason they were more wary of him . The Irish in the know thought of him , along with a handful of others , as one of Boston 's corners . " I know what you are , Brady , " said Jack Hurley . They were seated alone at the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . Hurley was one of the other two Curley appointees , a weary party worker of Curley 's generation , about sixty , a man widely regarded as a small-time political hack . Brady liked Hurley , but was always made uneasy by the air of disappointed ambition that clung to him . It was a Tuesday morning in April , 1936 . They were the first two council members to arrive for the weekly meeting . " What am I , Jack ? " Brady had his thumbs hooked in his vest . His feet were on the table . He lit a cigar . " You 're the bloody dark horse . " " Am I ? " " I think you are . The mayor 's getting old . " " The mayor 's the governor , Jack . " " Right . " Brady had what by then had become a familiar thought : Curley 's administrationhad been a great disappointment . The legislature had fought him tooth and nail on the great social welfare programs he 'd proposed and had succeeded in paralyzing the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous . There had been some improvement in the statewide employment curve , but Brady knew that was due to initiatives from Washington , not Beacon Hill . The first year of Curley 's term had been anticlimactic after the raucous heated campaign . Even his coup on the Executive Council had turned out to be less significant than expected . Gurley had exercised total control over appointments and contracts , favor/ing his cronies and , as always , accepting gifts from the companies doing business with the Commonwealth . But the reform of the tax structure , the revision of property codes and the establishment of serious state relief systems  --  reforms for which Brady had worked vigorously  --  had all been thwarted by the Yankee opposition down the hall . It was significant to Brady that Curley was still " the mayor , " even to his friends . That no one thought of him as " the governor " embodied his defeat . " Even a dark horse . .  --  Brady drew on his cigar , studied its smoke  --  " . . . needs a track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick of tracks . " " What are you saying , Jack ? " " I 'm saying I 'll support you . I think you should run . " " For ? " " Mayor . And do n't raise your eyebrows . " " What about Tobin ? " Hurley shrugged noncommittally , but then said , " I 'd rather see you . So would Kane . The boys would rather you . " " Well , Jack , " Brady said carefully , " I appreciate that . I do indeed . " " But ? " " I 've time . I 'm thirty-eight . I signed on with Curley . I 'm willing to see that through . " " He 's finished . He 'll never get reelected governor . " " I know that . " Brady pulled his feet down from the table and leanedtoward Hurley . " And that 's my problem . He may want to run for mayoragain . He can , you know . It 's only successive terms he 's forbidden . " " Colman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because  --  this is between us  --  he 's going to run for the Senate . " " Washington ? " " Yup . The U.S. Senate . " Brady was shocked . Curley running for the Senate ? Why did n't he know that ? Why was he hearing this crucial news from a hack poi ? Brady was suddenly filled with uneasiness . What did it mean that Curley had kept this from him ? What was Curley up to ? Brady knew instantly that he could not wait any longer . If Curley had his hand on the rug under Brady 's feet , he had to step off . It was time to move . No matter what Curley did , he would run for mayor in the fall . Brady resolved to be very careful . It was important that Hurley not detect his uneasiness . He forced a laugh . " The Senate ? Curley ? They 'll kill him . " " Maybe . " Hurley shrugged again . " Depends on Roosevelt . " " But Lodge is running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . " " He 's my age , Jack . And he 's one of them . " Hurley shrugged . " So was Bacon . " Brady shrugged back at him . " The point is , Colman , you 've a place on the rail for mayor if you want it . " I want it , " Brady said simply . " Good . " " But there 's another problem . " " What ? " " I 'm not certain Curley would . . . " He let it hang . " What are you talking about ? He worships you . " " But he owns Tobin . You should understand something about me , Jack . If I 'm in Curley 's shadow now it 's because I choose to be . When I step out of it , it will not be into someone else 's shadow . The reins on me are in my hands . Not his . Not yours . Not the boys ' . See , the mayor understandsthat . " " The governor . " " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might go with Tobin . " " And he might go with me . " They both had the same thought again . Curley had never gone with Hurley . That was the source of his subdued bitterness . Brady stared at him , knowing there was a lesson in the man for him . " I 'm glad you brought it up , Jack . And I 'd welcome your support . " " If it comes to that . " " Righto , amico ! " Brady smiled , leaned back in his chair , and put his feet back up on the table again . Hurley turned his attention to the sheaf of papers in his folder . He made a show of reviewing the agenda for the council meeting . After some moments Brady rose and crossed to the high windows and stood looking out at the Common , Beacon Street , Park Street , the Union Club , the Ticknor mansion , the first leaves of spring . Do n't squander your time , he thought . Do n't squander it , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shadows . It was not that the glamour of office held any charm for Brady by then , nor that the ebullient agitation that convinced Curley of his existence held anything fur him , nor that he needed the millions to tell him he was alive . Brady was aloof finally from the collective political ecstasies of his own people , and that was exactly why they needed him as their new political leader . Brady was in the prime of his life . His base was solid . His personal qualities  --  confidence , brain , diligence  --  were honed and well known . He was ready . He was fresh out of patience . " Do n't squander your time , " he repeated to himself . He had served , ifp222anything too long , as Curley 's strolling sage and had promulgated his own image as a faithful and discerning aide . And he was . He had been loyalty itself . Brady owed nothing to Curley . The truth was , Curley owed a debt to Brady , though Brady knew full well he felt none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction inevitable . Curley'ssense of his own power would require Brady 's humiliation . Brady had known that for a long time . Curley 's omnivorous hunger , unappeased by the idolatry of strangers , fed on the faithfulness of his friends . But Brady had learned how to survive Curley . As he stood there then , looking out on the Common , he realized that he was no longer in Curley 's orbit . He was his own man . It was possible that Curley would not support him for mayor , but Brady was sure he could cross-ruff him . What else did Hurley 's ass-kissing mean ? It was even possible that Curley would try to undo him , but Curley had nothing left with which to get him . Brady felt a special pity for Curley , who had thought  --  it was the Irish dream  --  that conquering Beacon Hill was a way of conquering Mayfair and Knightsbridge , since the English plutocrats in their Brahmin incarnation were so untouched by the office of mayor and its prerogatives . But when Curley stormed the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left with a form of power , but it was only power over allies , not enemies . But Brady 's pity was tempered by his contempt for the rule Curley devised in response to his own emasculation : when the enemy is invisible and absent and indifferent , use your weapons on your friends . That Brady understood this made him invulnerable . How queerly it plays , he thought . Curley was accused of habitual fraud and it was true . His great fraud was his power . The only difference between old Hurley and Curley was a pair of initials and the fact that the governor 's suit fit . The Irish achievement was what they said it was , a mere agility in swindling . But they did not swindle banks or property owners or investors or contractors  --  or not only . They swindled themselves , an achievement of deceit , self-deceit . But there was no self-deceit in Colman Brady , and he knew it . He was going to be a very different leader , a man who embodied the best , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the top-floor dining room windows of the Union Club on Park Street , the old Lawrence and Lowell townhouses combined . If you did n't know it was there you 'd never notice it . He recalled hearing that that dining room had been the maids ' rooms of both the grandmothersof Abbott Lawrence Lowell . Real power goes unobserved and is held by simple men who have no need to show themselves . That was why Brady thought that the office of mayor would be the beginning of his power , not the limit of it.  | " Colman ? " Hurley piped wheezily through his nostrils . His voice was up in pitch . There was concern in it . Brady turned to face him . He brushed the lock of hair off his forehead . " What 's this pardon business ? " Hurley was staring at a page in his hands . " Gennaro Anselmo . We owe him one . " " He 's one of those gangsters , North End hoodlums . " " Small stuff , Jack . " " Says murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why the pardon ? " " He 's done good time . " " Well , if it 's third degree he can get paroled . " " He wo n't be eligible till Curley 's out " " But we usually leave this kind alone . I do n't get it . " " Go on , Jack . We 've pardoned third degree before . It 's old hat . Besides , I told you . We owe him one . " Brady wanted Anselmo out of prison for two reasons , one slightly sentimental and one totally pragmatic . Anselmohad avenged Jerry MacCurtain , but much more importantly , with luck and methods Brady wanted not to know about , Anselmo could replace Cosolirno as head of the Sicilian mob , which was more powerful than ever . If Brady was going to win Boston his first time out , he 'd need the North End . Anselmo in power would deliver it for him . " Risky , Colman , if you ask me . " Hurley waited for Brady to turn around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , Jack ? " Brady continued to give him his back . " Ask me . " " Ask you what ? " Hurley shrugged . Edward Howard entered the chamber , one of the Republicans . He noddedtoward Hurley without looking at him . He did not acknowledge Brady at the window . Howard was seventy-two years old , a retired banker , a musty man whose manner expressed patience and pessimism . He sat down at his customary chair and opened his valise and withdrew his folder . He started reviewing the papers , mirroring Hurley . He was followed shortly by Dr. Gregory and William Sargent , two more Republicans . Dr. Gregory , a short bald man , eccentric in his seersucker coat , displayed a studied courtesy . He shook hands with Howard and Hurley , then approached Brady , who snapped out of his reverie and greeted the doctor with a counterfeit politeness of his own . Within a few minutes the entire council was assembled . Hurley left the room to notify Curley . While he was gone no one spoke . Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen Mary entering Boston Harbor . The place suddenly seemed too small to contain not him but what he gave off . Hurley slipped in behind him , subtle , subservient , folding into his chair the way little waves fold out of the wake of a ship . " Gentlemen , " Curley said , acknowledging them when they rose . At his nod they sat . He dropped a pile of books , Commonwealth statutes , and papers on the table before him . " The council is in order . " He nodded at the stenographer , who had slipped into the room behind Hurley . She sat at her own small table by the door . The governor put his reading glasses on , and they threw trembling flashes of sunlight about the room . " As to the minutes . . . , " he said . There was a rustling of papers as members withdrew their copies from their folders . The meeting proceeded according to the agenda , which , compared to most , was innocuous and lacking in controversy . Pro-forma budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for the reservoirs , and the like . No judgeships , no fat contracts , no replacementsof Republicans in the Bulfinch bureaucracy  --  none of the issues which drew automatic if futile fire from the outgunned minority . Curley expected the meeting to go smoothly . He did not expect the protest from Howard about the pardon . " Governor , I object , " Howard said , just as Curley was about to move the question . Curley glared at him . " I received my copy of this proposal only this morning . " " Yes ? " Curley often sprang things on them at the last minute . " I 'd have liked to make an inquiry of my own . " " Mr. Brady has prepared a thorough brief for the council . All the informationneeded , Councilor , is there . " Curley flicked the corners of pages in his own folder . " The recommendations of the warden , and of the district attorney , and of the sheriff of Middlesex County  --  all of whom agree the man in question has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But there 's nothing from the judge . Who tried the case ? " " Daniel Bell . " " But he 's dead . " " Quite so , God rest him . " Howard collected himself , pausing visibly to summon his patience . He was funereal and odd as he sat stoop-shouldered over the folder , examiningit . He could on occasion ravage meetings with his ire , but clearly hep225did not feel strongly about this matter . He was simply whining . Curley was indulging him . It was not a big deal . " But Governor , there 's nothing here about his deed . Murder , it says . " " Yes . Third degree . " " But murder ! Whom did he murder ? " " Zorelli . " Howard shook his head . " That 's what I mean . I ca n't be expected to vote on this matter . I never heard of any of this . " " You never heard of Zorelli ? " " Never . " Howard met Curley 's glare with equanimity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Al Capone ? Did you never hear of Dillinger ? Did you never hear of Judas Iscariot ? What would you say if somebody did one of them in ? " " I would say , Thou shalt not kill . ' " " Jesus H. Christ ! " Curley slapped his forehead . Then , visibly , he changed his tactic . " Anyway , I 'm granting this pardon because of my belief that the man is innocent . " " You mean he did not kill this Zorelli ? " " No , " he lied . " I would like to review the evidence . " " So would I , " said Dr. Gregory . The others sat stonily , quiet , staring down at their papers . " Move to table , " Howard said . " Second , " said the doctor . " All in favor , " intoned Curley . " Aye , " the Republicans said . " Opposed ? " " Nay , " said the Democrats . " Settled . Now on the motion . " " Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Democrats . " Carried . " Curley withdrew a formal-looking document from his folder . It was the official proclamation of pardon . " As required of me . " He adjusted his glasses and withdrew his pen from his pocket . " I will sign this order in your presence . " He read the document silently , moving his lips . He looked up at Colman Brady and said , " Who 's the petitioner ? " " What ? " " ' Identify the petitioner , ' it says . " " That 'll be Anselmo 's wife . The petition is brought in his behalf by her . "  | " No . " " What ? " Brady sat forward . What was Curley thinking ? " You 're the petitioner . " " No , I 'm not . " Brady felt a sudden bulging behind his left eye . What in hell was Curley talking about ? " You are . You 're the one who talked to all these people . You got their recommendations . You endorsed them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On your behalf . So that you could respond to Mrs. Anselmo 's petition responsibly . " " Come here and sign this , Mr. Brady . " Curley held the pen toward him . Brady rose , walked behind Hurley to the head of the table , took the governor 's pen and signed the proclamation without flourish . Then , also without flourish , Curley signed it . Then the moment was past . And the council moved on to other business . The next day Gennaro Anselmo was released from the Norfolk prison colony without fanfare or publicity . His wife was unable to pick him up at the prison , which was twenty-five miles outside the city . Though she 'd been able to borrow her cousin 's car , she did n't know how to drive it , and none of the men she asked were free to go with her . But she could n't get a message to her husband to say she would n't be there . Anselmo waited at the prison gate for fifteen minutes . He sat impassivelyon the weathered bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a felt hat , a baggy serge suit , new , and carried his belongings  --  a few books , some underwear , his toiletry  --  in a cardboard box wrapped with twine . When his wife failed to show , he guessed what had happened . No one would dare accompany her . That seemed reasonable to him . He hitched a ride with a prison supply truck into the town of Walpole , and then walked to the bus station . The next bus to Boston would not depart for fifty minutes . He crossed to the common and sat on the ground under a large elm . The ground was damp . The tree formed a fragile green-yellow canopy . He noticed for the first time that it was spring . " Hey , Gennaro ! Gennaro ! " A large black car cruised slowly along the edge of the park , and Sergio Capelli was leaning out of the driver 's window , waving at hirn . Capelli had been running the garbage business while Anselmo was at Norfolk . He had visited Anselmo half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife.  |p227But  she was not in the car . Two men rode in the back seat , not waving . Anselmo picked up his bundle and walked across the grass to the corner where Capelli had stopped . One of the men got out and held the door for him . Anselmo did not recognize him . He got in . The man got in next to him , pushing in close , wedging him up against the other man , who was also unknown to Anselmo . They dwarfed him . Anselmo had expected them to move against him before he 'd had a chance to arm himself . Here it was . " Hey , Gennaro ! Gennaro ! Great to see you ! " Capelli ranted nervously , putting the car in gear and sliding around the corner into traffic . The man on Anselmo 's left had his gun drawn . He nestled it in his lap , the barrel pointed at Anselmo 's groin . The man who 'd followed him into the car was still pressing , trying to pin his arm . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two had settled themselves , Anselmo struck . He whipped both of his fists in opposite directions in a rapid flapping motion away from his stomach . His fists held steel dinner knives , which had been sharpened to stiletto points . The knives had been sheathed loosely in his sleeves and now plunged into the chests of the two men . He released the knives immediately and grabbed their gun hands , which he held until the wounds did their work . Both had gasped audibly , and then , almost instantly , almost simultaneously , had slumped slightly against the seats . Capelli continued his nervous chatter , slapping his gaze against the rearview mirror . Anselmo was staring at him . It was Anselmo'seyes that told Capelli what had happened . Capelli nearly wrecked the auto when he turned to look . The sight of Anselmo , stony , impassive between the two inert hulks with red breasts plunged into Capelli like a blade . " Oh , Christ ! " he said . " Oh , Christ ! " The car veered toward a wall . Capelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that he 'd have done better to drive into it . " Oh , Christ , " he muttered again , staring straight ahead , aiming for a. bus , trying not to look into the mirror again . He passed the bus . He brushed the mirror . Anselmo was still staring at him , a trancelike , rigid anarchy in his eyes . Capelli looked away and tried to concentrate on his driving . He would not look in the mirror again . " Do n't kill me , Gennaro . Please do n't kill me . " Anselmo said nothing.  | " They made me . They made me . " Anselmo still did not comment . He did not move . He continued tohold the wrists of the two , although death 's grip already had them . When Capelli understood that Anselmo was going neither to speak tonor kill him then , he put all his effort into driving . He neither spoke norlost control of his glance again until they were nearly at Dedham . " Turn here , " Anselmo said . Capelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a farm . " Stop . " Capelli stopped the car . There were woods on both sides of the road . Capelli felt himself overwhelmed by a giant terror . He was going to die and it was his bad luck to know it . Anselmo took the gun and then leaned across the corpses to open one door and then the other . He pushed the bodies out of the car and that was all . An enormous relief that threatened to take the form of giddiness filled Capelli . He put the car in reverse and squealed back out onto the main road . He was as high-strung and anguished as the overworked gear that screeched in protest at the way he gunned the car toward Boston . As they crossed Jamaica Plain on the new WPA highway Anselmo said , " Cosolimo . " " Oh , Christ , Gennaro , do n't make me drive you there . " Anselmo said nothing . Capelli had trouble negotiating the fast curves of the Jamaicaway because his hands were soaked with perspiration and they slid futilely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweated . The noontime bustle was just ebbing at Haymarket when Capelli wound his way past the pushcarts and vegetable stands that spilled spoiled artichokes and melons out into the street . He felt as though he were the pilot of a phantom ship . He expected everyone to be staring at them as he headed into Hanover Street , but no one seemed to notice the lumbering auto . Anselmo had pulled the brim of his felt hat down over the bridge of his nose and was snug against the brown cloth panel behind the rear side window . Capelli pulled the car up in front of the Cantina Reale , and put it into neutral . He was afraid to turn the engine off . " Go tell Cosolimo I am here . " Capelli looked in the mirror for the first time since Walpole , but he could not see Anselmo because he was in the corner . He turned half around to give him his most pleading look , but Anselmo 's eyes gunned him.  |p229Ca|pelli  pulled the brake up and got out . He went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in to see Cosolimo . Two bodyguards were sitting in wooden chairs on the cramped landing at the top of the stairs . " He 's here ! Anselmo is here ! Downstairs ! Out front ! " The two guards both went into the office . Capelli pressed himself into the dark corner opposite the door . The guards came out again , followed by two others . They made Capelli lead them down . The car seemed to be empty . The guards approached it cautiously . Just as one of them whipped open the back door they heard the gunshotfrom the office . And then a second . They looked at each other . No one wanted to lead the rush upstairs . Capelli said frantically , " I did n't know ! I did n't know ! " One of the guards looked down the alley . The rear door to the building flapped in the breeze . The men continued to hesitate . Anselmo had the ability to murder . He had an ability that Cosolimo could not match . They knew it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply out of fear . It was also that the prize of power in the Unione belonged to the one who took it . GREETING : It having pleased GOD to inspire the love of learning amongst the first settlers of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay and , in the infancy of their community , to direct their labors towards the well-being of Church and State through the establishment of foundations for the increase of knowledge and the education of youth , it is meet and proper that this Society of Scholars , founded in the Year of Our Lord one thousand six hundred and thirty-six , by Act of a Great and General Court of the Company of Massachusetts Bay convened in Boston the 8th/18th of September of that year , should celebrate in the company of friends and benefactors the THREE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY of its foundation . It was an iron fall morning , threatening rain . Colman Brady could not have been more ill at ease . He read the invitation again.  |p230Then  he looked across the coach at His Excellency the Governor , who was dressed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were riding in an old landau drawn by four horses , preceded by a company of redcoatedcavalrymen on horseback and a small military band blaring trumpets . They had approached Harvard Square from Cambridge Street and were now on Peabody , the short angle-street between two segments of Massachusetts Avenue . They were drawing up to the Johnston Gate , an elaborate wrought-iron arch anchored on brick pillars . The arch was a tangle of wreaths and vines ; in its center was a black cross over the numbers 1889 . On both pillars were mounted molded scrolls with Latin pronouncements . The governor of the Commonwealth was traditionally a dominant figure at the Harvard commencement , but Curley had resurrectedthe old custom of the coach-and-four for the occasion of the Tercentenary . No governor had arrived at Harvard with such pomp since the nineteenth century . Curley was like an excited child . To occupy the place of honor at Harvard ! To receive an honorary degree , as every governor had before him ! This was a day toward which the energy of his entire political life had aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore him or defeat him this time . Brady thought they were making fools of themselves . Bystanders gawked and waved . Brady dropped his eyes to read the invitation again . Curley was leaning forward in the window , grasping the strap with one hand , waving with the other , " It 's a great day for the Irish , Colman ! A great day for our people ! " " You wo n't see many of our people inside those walls , Governor . " " But that 's over , son . Curley 's here ! You mark my word . I sit in the big carved chair in the middle of the damn stage ! I get my degree ! Me ! Who hardly finished St. Eulalia 's ! A Doctor of Laws from Harvard ! Ha ! Ha ! " Curley reached across to slap Brady 's shoulder . The wonder of it ! The delight ! But the coach lurched sideways suddenly , throwing him off balance . One of the wheels had wedged itself in the streetcar tracks . " Hey , Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his head . " You watch it up there ! And you , " he said to Brady , " do n't look so goddamn glum . This time next year I 'll be the senator from this state ! You 'll be the mayor of Boston ! And we 'll have one of our own boys as governor ! And degrees from Harvard for everybody ! By God ! By Curley ! " Brady knew that in some way he was right . Things had changed . He was about to be the preeminent government figure at the most solemn celebration in Harvard 's history . In all likelihood he was about to receive the degree , though Harvard 's custom was to keep secret the list of recipi/ents . Much as it would gall them to honor Curley , Brady knew they were capable of conferring the degree on his office while ignoring him . Harvard would not change a custom of three centuries just because , for once , it involvedan Irishman . Brady was relieved when they pulled up to the gate . Curley would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brady , having provided Curley with his preliminary company and having served as audience for his raucous agitation , would be free to wander about the Yard and take in the spectacle . It all held enormous fascination for Brady , and he was prepared to enjoy the great irony of Curley 's participation . He wondered how they would deal with him . Brady expected that they would match Curley 's exuberant ego with restraint and perfect manner . They would honor the governor while disdaining James Michael Curley , who would n't know the difference . Curley hopped out of the coach when a gold-braided officer opened the door . The officer saluted formally . Curley , having mustered restraint of his own , nodded and doffed his silk hat . Brady got down from the coach , relieved . He looked up at the sky , half-hoping for rain . He chided himself instantly for the pettiness of the thought . Let them have their celebration in peace and dry weather . A cluster of marshals , all bedecked in silk hats and cutaways , greeted Curley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a program and offered to show him to the staging area . Curley opened the program as he started to follow the marshal and then stopped . Brady heard him say , pointing to the order of ceremony , " Is this where I give my speech ? " " Your speech , sir ? " " Yes . Greetings from His Excellency the Governor of the Commonwealth . ' " " Yes , sir . Greetings . ' We have prepared the text for you . " " What do you mean ? " " The Chief Marshal will provide the text of your greetings , sir . If you will follow me . " The man turned and walked down the lane between the great elms which opened on the quadrangle where some of the earliest buildings of the College sat in cultivated simplicity . Curley gave the man one of his fierce glares , but it was lost on him and the others as they strode away . Curley cast a look at Brady , who recognizedits mix of anger and insecurity . " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish you could come with me . " Brady raised a hand , reassuring with a brash wave . Then Curley followed the marshals , whose obstinate gait embodied the capacity to be rude without being gauche . They strodep232between Harvard Hall and Massachusetts Hall , both of which predated the revolution , toward University Hall and its seated bronze of John Harvard , who brooded over the quadrangle . Brady stood under the arch , taking in the scene . He noted the Latin inscriptions on the pillars and the cross of iron above his head ; both seemed strangely religious , strangely un-Protestant . The acres within the gate were alive with intense activity . Great class banners and flags waving from poles located various contingents of alumni , faculty , undergraduates , and guests who were preparing for the solemn procession into the TercentenaryTheatre , which occupied the great expanse of the Yard that was on the far side of University Hall . The crackling of an electrical speaker system , still being tested , filled the air . There was a swirl of costume  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant colored hoods  --  which made Brady feel , even in his cutaway and top hat , inconspicuousand commonplace . Despite himself , he was filled with a kind of reverence as he strolled , hands in his pockets , past Harvard Hall into the center of the brisk scene . He walked casually past groups of men in clustersaround their class flags , overhearing the clipped Brahmin accent . Waving from white poles were prominent heraldic banners of the college houses . He sauntered in and out of the groups , noting the arched eyes of the celebrants . Many of the participants seemed , with their thin , lanky postures , their fine jaws , their neatly trimmed moustaches , to have been stamped from one mold . An alien mold . At communion breakfasts or picnics or rallies in South Boston , the faces were a little too thick , the necks fleshy and bulging uncomfortablyover hard white collars , the legs shorter and slightly bowed , the backs curved , the skin flushed . But in Southie the eyes were brighter and there would be laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dull murmured introversion circled over the heads of the people in contrast to the gaiety of clothing and the glad-trappings . Brady went by University Hall into the contiguous part of the Yard , which was a frozen sea of wooden chairs , thousands of them , all lined perfectlyto face the huge platform springing from the steps of the College Church . Here and there groups of men and women  --  though mostly men  --  filed into sections of the seats . Above the theater was a canopy of elm and oak foliage which was punctured by the needle of the white church steeple . Compared to the chaos of the quadrangle and the trample of Cambridge , the Tercentenary Theatre achieved a seclusion and dignity that approached the monastic . A passing student handed Brady a program . He took it and thanked the boy , thinking how young he seemed  --  not much older , he thought ,  |p233than  Micko . Brady suddenly felt old . He looked at the cover of the brochure . A paragraph in fine italics caught his eye . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-thought of anniversary . Cambridge at any time is full of ghosts ; but on that day the annointed eye saw the crowd of spirits that mingled with the procession in the vacant spaces , year by year , as the classes proceeded ,  --  and then the far longer train of ghosts that followed the company , of the men that wore before us the college honors and the laurels of the State  --  the long , winding train reaching back into eternity.  --  Emerson : Journals , September 13 , 1836Brady stared at the brochure and mulled over Emerson 's words . Even a hundred years ago , Harvard had a sense of itself as having spawned a long train of men who had embodied an excellence of mind and spirit . The idea , however pompous , surprised Brady by touching him . He envied that line of ghosts and knew that he could have been at home among them . Brady looked up at the large platform at the head of the theater , the steeple stabbing skyward . The platform 's score of chairs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a podium in its center . Behind the podium was a single row of elaborately carved medieval chairs ; in the middle of the row , on a level slightly higher than the others was a thronelike chair , the place of honor , the focal point of the entire scene . All at once Brady realized that that chair , that throne , would be occupied by James Michael Curley , Saint Eulalia 's Class of ' 92 . Brady laughed out loud . Emerson would shoot himself . He felt a drop of rain hit his shoulder and looked up . The clouds glowered down . Brady turned and surveyed the letters on the poles at various points . He withdrew the invitation from his inside pocket . The attached ticket had the bold inscription D8-221 . The guidon of the section where he stood was marked with a bold A. He craned back and saw the letter C in the far corner of the Yard . Section D would be even farther off , on the rearmost fringe of the assembly . Typical . The Irish section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd be seated with the gardeners and the maids . Opposite the Memorial Church , forming an imposing rear boundary to the open-air theater , was the enormous Widener Library with its great sweeping staircase , solemn and pyramid-like . At the top of the stairs huge pillars supported the overreaching portico , which made the library itself scens a forbidden cloister . From the portico one could see everything inp234the Yard , and , if the rains fell mercilessly , one could stay dry . Brady crossed to the steps and ascended them two at a time . He was thinking of the climb up the hill behind Four Mile Water to the ancient Druid monolith , the places where his long winding train began . Ireland at any time is full of ghosts . The anointed eye sees crowds of spirits . Brady thought that his eye and Emerson 's were not so different . Others would have laughed to know that Colman Brady was recognizing alien Harvard as his own terrain . He took up a position well away from the massive doors of the library , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portico as he could get . Guides and marshals bustled about , and a staff of caterers hurried into the library . The reception for dignitaries would be held there after the ceremony . A tall , dark , raven-haired man edged close to him , saying , softly out of the corner of his mouth , " Beg pardon , sir , but this area is . . . " " Quite right , my man , " Brady said in a false accent . " Do keep this area clear , would you ? " " Yes , sir . " The man bowed slightly and moved off . Brady took his case out of his pocket , withdrew a thin cigar and prepared to light it , feeling slightly mischievous as he did so . The more outrageous I am , he thought , the more comfortable they 'd feel if they knew who I was . It was a thought worthy of Curley . Brady changed his mind and put the cigar back in its case , the case back in his pocket . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello . " Brady turned . Standing next to him was a tall blond woman with pencil-thin brows , a large hat brimming down over one eye . She wore a mannish black suit , but the tan ruffled blouse dispelled any air of masculinity . At the corner of her mouth was a twist of mischief , not quite a smile . Her forearms were crossed below her bosom as if to display it . Her skin was extremely white . Her face was slightly tilted toward Brady , as if she were offering him her uncovered eye , a patch of her marble forehead . " I know , " he said , " Edwina Booth . Trader Horn . " " Right , " she said , showing nothing . " And you 've come to tell me this is private property . " Her face broke into a full smile , which she held as if it were an achievement . " How are you , Mrs. Thomson ? " " Aside from the fact that I ca n't remember your name , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . "  | " That was three years ago . " He was thinking she looked younger , not older . " The day of Repeal . " " Right . " " How 's your son ? " " Fine , thank you . " " He must be . . . " " Fourteen last month . " " How wonderful . " A pause . " I must admit , I did n't expect to see you again . " " Nor I you . " " And certainly not here . " As soon as she said this she realized the rudenessof it , given , well . . . " I meant , " she began , " That is , I . . . " " Are there no places for thieves at Harvard ? " " Only important ones . " Her hand went automatically to her mouth ; she had done it again . Was she trying to offend him ? But he laughed , relieving her anxiety before it built . " Are you here to convey the greetings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity is English . " " It 's in Dublin , I thought . " He shrugged . The ignorance of Americans could still surprise him . " And you ? " he asked . " You 're hardly a son of Fair Harvard . " " No . The unfair wife of one . My husband 's on the Board of Overseers . He 's going to be in the parade . " She gestured toward the amphitheater . " It 's going to rain . " A fitful wind was crossing the Yard , lifting the banners and wafting the leaves . " Do you know the story of Widener Library , Mr. Brady ? " She continued to stare over the expanse of chairs . More people had taken their places . " No , I do n't . " " Harry Elkins Widener was on board the Titanic . " " Is that so ? " Brady said , genuinely affected . But somehow it seemed inevitable as soon as she said it . There were always events of drama and curiosity behind the most minor details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aristocrat of tragedies . What else for Harvard ? A kick in the head from a horse ? " His mother gave the library in his honor . " The palpable sadness with which Madeline Gardner Thomson said this reminded Brady of her fury at him when he struck Micko . If she 'd told him that her own child had been lost overboard at sea , he would not have been surprised.  |p236Brady  studied her . She was perfectly still without being rigid . She gazed off across the Yard as if she could see Emerson 's ghosts , the phantom ship of the tossing trees . She was looking out on her native land . To Brady for an instant she was a full-length oil painting , revealed in the subtlest way . He was aware of the nuance of light and shadow on her skin , the hint of darkness below her cheekbone , the desolate half-moon below her eye . He was drawn to her . He wondered what she loved . A peal of bells erupted from the conical loudspeaker at the foot of Widener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Memorial Church ; the sound was not coming from there . The bells crackled and reverberated , but there was a tinny , artificial quality to the sound that seemed wrong . " Oh , listen ! " Mrs. Thomson said . Why would they have a falsely amplified carillon ? All over Harvard there were bell towers ; why were n't they all ringing to announce the procession ? " Listen ! " she repeated , " All the way from England ! At this very moment ! " Her voice vibrated with the wonder of it . All the way from En-gland ! The irony of it struck him ; Trinity was Irish , but Harvard was English . The pealing bells , tinny and false , ringing from wires , not towers , seemed a proof to him . Of what he was n't sure , but a proof , powerful and damning . From behind University Hall came the blue uniformed figure of the sheriff of Middlesex County , pounding his sword-in-scabbard in rhythm with his walk . Behind him there fluttered a huge narrow crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession entered the Yard . Brady recognized Abbott Lawrence Lowell in the front rank . " That 's Former President Lowell , " Mrs. Thomson said , pointing . Brady had last seen him at Louisburg Square before the Curley rally . " And with him , that 's President Conant , " she said . Brady saw the slender , frail man , James Bryant Conant , the worldrenownedyoung chemist who had succeeded President Lowell in 1933 . " There are the students , " she said , as if it was n't obvious what the enteringranks of black-robed boys were . Then came contingents of alumni behind marshals carrying class flags , members of the Board of Overseers , deans , faculty , and delegates from universities all over the world . They bobbed in two-by-two under threatening skies . In their billowing gowns and hoods and eccentric caps of all hues and fashions ; in their showing of reds and greens and blues and yellows ; in their display of feathered plumes and ermine and velvet stoles ; in their slow , somber pomp , Bradyp237thought they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filinginto the Ark just ahead of the great storm . " Alfred North Whitehead , " Mrs. Thomson said , pointing to a short figure in Cambridge scarlet . " They all have three names , do n't they ? " " What ? " " Nothing . " At the end of the great train came the presiding officers . Madeline Thomson craned forward and tugged Brady 's arm . " Look , there 's ProfessorMorison , the historian . " Brady saw the erect , confident scholar . " That 's Bishop Lawrence ahead of him , " Madeline said , " but I do n't know who 's beside him . " " James Michael Curley , " Brady said . Despite his top hat and formal dress , Curley 's figure was drab and dull compared to the brilliantly robed bishop and academics . " Oh . The governor . " " Yes . His Excellency . " She smiled at Brady . " He has three names , I notice . " " And two faces , " Brady joked . He felt instantly disloyal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presiding officer . " " No , he 's not . " There was an Are-you-kidding ? aspect to Mrs. Thomson'svoice . " He is , " she said , pointing to the platform . The dignitaries at the head of the procession were just mounting it , and the audience was rustling in observation as Franklin D. Roosevelt , ' 04 , was unobtrusively being transferred by two large men from his wheelchair to the great throne behind the podium . He was dressed in silk hat . Light flashed off his spectacles . " Oh , Christ ! " Brady 's heart sank . His eyes dropped down the aisle to Curley . He wondered if he knew . " That was n't announced , was it ? " Brady asked . " No . Even my husband was unsure whether he would come . He has n't been well , they say . " It would kill Curley . Just kill him . At once Brady understood that Curley could not know ; he 'd have backed out . He would n't have let them do this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the grating confrontation with Roosevelt , who had as yet refused to support Curley 's bid for the Senate seat , and who had humiliated Curley by implying he could n't be trusted with public funds . It would kill him , just kill him . Brady stared at Curley 's figure as the end of the procession arrived at the platform . While the throng of people were taking their chairs , fewp238noticed the governor 's awkward stumble , which occurred when Conant cut in front of him to greet Roosevelt  --  when the President greeted Mr. Roosevelt , as the Harvard wags would put it . Both Bishop Lawrence and President Conant stood with their backs to Curley , who stalled like a blindered horse , not knowing where to go . For a brief moment he cut a sad , pathetic figure . Curley had arrived , Brady thought . And they ignoredhim . Brilliant . Only the honorary degree would redeem the indignityof it . With a show of courtesy , President Conant ushered Curley to one of the line of wooden chairs , seating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat next to Roosevelt . The sheriff of Middlesex County approached the podium , banged his sword-in-scabbard three times on the platform and commanded , " The meeting will be in order ! " And then the rain began to fall . Umbrellas sprouted all over the acreage of the Yard like mushrooms . They began a slow steady undulation , giving the entire gathering , when seen from above , the aspect of a black sea . The platform floated over it like the Ark . Its dignitaries ignored the rain with splendid disdain , aristocratsall . Someone began speaking in Latin : " Salvete omnes ! " Brady wondered why they were dead set against Latin in church if they 'd use it here . He looked at his program as if it held the answer . One more speaker would precede Curley . Professor Samuel Eliot Morison 's address was a long-winded description of how Harvard came to be established . It concluded , " From the small college here planted in sylvestribus et incultis locis , ' on the verge of the Western Wilderness , Harvard University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely derived . So we are gathered here to commemorate our founders and early benefactors ; to thank God for the faith , overriding all prudent objections and practical difficulties , that sustainedthem through poverty and struggle , in so ambitious and so excellentan enterprise . " Then the Tercentenary Chorus , lined against the rear wall of the platform , began to sing Gabrieli 's " In Deo Salutari Meo . " " I 'm struck by the irony , Mrs. Thomson . . . " " Of the rain ? " " No . Of the Latin . The language of the Church . " " Latin serves the Church and Harvard equally well , Mr. Brady , since it 's a dead language . " He could n't help registering surprise at her caustic tone.  | " Are you shocked ? " she asked . " Does n't it all seem like spectacle and pomp , much ado about nothing ? " " Frankly , it does n't to me . " The opening rites of the liturgy  --  it was as liturgy that it struck him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were his the way it was hers . " My husband worships Harvard . He 's a fool . " " Well , only the possessors of privilege ever see through it , Mrs. Thom-son . " " I 'd say God sees through it . Lots of silk hats going to be ruined today . he careful of yours . " " It 's rented . " She gave him a look that said , " How quaint ! " " What are you doing here anyway ? " she asked . " I 'm the gardener . With an e . " " You remembered . " She smiled warmly . " Blind and peeless . " They both laughed . The chorus had finished . James Michael Curley was approaching the podium . He showed no sign of nervousness or embarrassment . In his slow , enchanting voice he read the greetings that had been prepared for him . " As the Governor of the Commonwealth of MassachusettsI take special pride in bringing greetings to Harvard University on the occasion of its Tercentenary . Massachusetts men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowedthe Commonwealth with the riches of learning and veritas . Therefore , in behalf of the citizens of Massachusetts , I beseech God 's Providence , which has watched over Harvard since its first home had to be fenced in to keep out the wolves , to continue to bless it , adorned as it is now with magnificent buildings and celebrated throughout the world as a great center of learning and as the proudest achievement of the Corninonwealthof Massachusetts . " He stopped reading and raised his eyes . Brady thought Curley hadhieved a dignity that made him almost venerable . Clearly he had come to the end of the text , and Brady sensed the enormous struggle in him . Brady knew how much he had wanted to make his own speech , and it seemed for a moment that he would . The crowd was hushed and attentive as Curley stared at them . What would he do ? He turned abruptly and strode back to his seat . The audience stirred , umbrellas swirled slightly this way and that . They did not applaud . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masefield , Poet Laureate of England , then read the poem he had composed for the occasion . " When Custom presses on the souls apart , Who seeks a God not worshipped by the herd . . And so on , Brady thought . Abbott Lawrence Lowell came forward then and , having to stoop slightly to the microphone , said , " The next speaker it would be impertinentfor me to introduce to you or to any American audience . He is the fourth graduate of Harvard College to hold the office of Chief Magistrate in our nation  --  two of them named Adams , and two Roosevelt . Gentlemen , The President of the United States ! " The audience stood up and applauded , its first demonstration . Roosevelt addressed them from his chair . " I am here today . . . as the President of the United States . . . as a son of Harvard who gladly returns to the spot where men have sought truth for three hundred years . . . . One hundred years ago . . . many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Andrew Jackson was President . On the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Harvard College , alumni were again sorely troubled . . . . Now , on the three hundredth anniversary , I am President . " The audience rose to its feet again and applauded wildly . As Brady watched them he realized they were not cheering the President . They were cheering themselves . Harvard ! Harvard ! Harvard ! And Brady got it . Despite himself , he caught their spirit . Even as an outsider he understood in a sudden wave of feeling why they would stand and celebrate themselves . For three hundred years they had been commissioningthe best men in America to America 's service . Roosevelt was only the latest , and he had saved the nation from despair and , probably , from collapse . Brady understood that it was not arrogance or smugness he was witnessing . These men simply had the capacity to rejoice in the gifts they 'd been given and what they were making of them . After Roosevelt 's speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America  --  Yesterday and Today , " the point of which seemed to be that the university tradition in America had mainly limited itself to Cambridge . " He who enters a university , " Conant said , " walks on hallowed ground . " Brady recalled feeling as he passed under the wrought=iron cross at the Peabody Street gate that he was entering church . When the speeches were given , the chorus rendered a song by Handel.  |p241Mrs  . Thomson touched Brady 's sleeve . " Now the degrees . My husband is on the committee . " Brady looked at her . She had no idea that the bestowal of the degree on Curley could have the meaning it had not only for the governor and not only for Brady but for many people who had never been inside Harvard Yard . " This is what I came for , " Brady said . " It 'll be a bore . There are sixty-two of them . " " You 're kidding . " Brady had expected only a handful of men to be honored . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a mechanical precision to the conferring of the degrees . PresidentConant read each citation , handed the diploma to one of four tophattedaides  --  " That 's my husband , " Madeline said , pointing to one of t hem . The aide conveyed the diploma to the recipient , who rose from his scat in a flash of color , received it , bowed , and sat down amid applause . As the names were read man after man rose and bowed and was applauded . Eddington , Svedberg , Fischer , Jung , Hopkins , Spemann , Krogh , Bergius , Maunier , Koussevitzky , Hu Shih , Wenger . Brady had heard of the conductor , of the astronomer Eddington , oflung , of course . But most of the scholars were unknown to him . When Etienne Gilson was announced , Brady leaned to Mrs. Thomsonand said , " Tell your husband he let a Catholic slip in when he did n't haveto . Mrs. Thomson did not understand the remark , as her blank look showed . As the roll went on and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if around a grain of sand . Curley 's name was not being called . It seemed every dignitary on the platform was being honored . Landsteiner , Rostovtzeff , Mitchell , Dent . But no Curley . Brady watched the governor carefully , but his rigid pose , arms locked onto his chair , displayed nothing . Finally , Conant 's voice fell silent . Brady prayed that the silence was prelude to the special announcement which would cite the ancient tradition which had the new meaning of peace between Harvard and the sons of Boston . But Conant 's silence had the purpose of conclusion , not prelude . He gathered his papers and turned from the podium . Brady looked at Curley , half expecting him to rise and grab the little man by the scapular.  |p242But  it was Bishop Lawrence who stood . He strode to the microphone and intoned the benediction . And then the audience was on its feet singing , " Oh God , Our Help in Ages Past . " At the conclusion of the hymn the dignitaries began to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still standing , broke into a second rousing hymn . " Fair Harvard ! Thy sons to thy jubilee throng , And with blessings surrender thee o'er . By these festival rites , from the age that is past To the age that is waiting before . 0 relic and type of our ancestors ' worth , That has long kept their memory warm , First flower of their wilderness ! Star of their night ! Calm rising through change and storm ! " " Well , " Mrs. Thomson said , adjusting her white gloves , " the storm is over . " Perhaps , " Brady muttered , " perhaps . " " What a cryptic murmur . Whatever do you mean ? " Brady turned to look her fully in the face . She did not know what her husband and his friends had just done , but they bloody well did . The procession of plutocrats was mounting the staircase to Widener like a great serpent entering a sanctuary . Brady was alert for Curley 's eye , but the governor passed stonily , impassive , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were studiously ignoring each other . At the top of the staircase the procession broke as the robed dignitaries entered Widener , where , in the great hall beneath the massive dome , " comforting nectar " was being served . Brady slipped into step with Curley and said , " Come on , Jim , let 's get out of here . " " The hell with you , " Curley hissed ; " I 'm getting a drink ! " Brady watched Curley make a beeline for the linen-draped tables . He could have predicted what followed . " What do you mean punch ' ? " Curley roared at the serving girl . " I want a drink . " The girl stood helpless and mute before him . " What 's in it ? " he demanded . " Champagne , sir , " she stammered , " or , in this one there 's ginger ale . . . "  |p243All  right ! All right ! " He accepted a cup-shaped glass , which he downed in a single gulp and held out again . Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . " " Get away from me , you ! " Brady had witnessed the humiliation ; that made him an enemy . Curley downed three cups of punch in succession . Despite his tremblinganger , no one seemed to notice his rudeness , aside from the waitress and Brady and a beefy young , formally dressed marshal , who approached the governor deferentially and murmured , " May I help you , sir ? " " You 're damn right ! Where 's the bourbon ? " " I 'll be glad to get you a highball , sir . It 'll take just a moment . " " Who said highball ? Just bourbon . About this much . " Curley spaced his thumb and forefinger . " Thank you , " Brady said to the marshal , who slipped off into the crowd . " I do n't need you doing my thanking , Brady ! " Curley was furious . " Now , Governor . . . " " You think I 've the manners of a croppie , do n't you ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brady deliberately walked behind a marble pillar into a small alcove off the hall . The governor followed him ; if they were going to tilt , at least they could do it out of sight of Harvard . " Do n't you walk away from me ! " " Look , Governor , you 're upset . And I understand . . . " You understand ! Shit ! You 're the reason I did n't get that degree . " " What are you talking about ? " " It 's Howard 's report . They 've read it . They think they 'll nail me with it . That 's why Roosevelt wo n't back me . " Brady had no idea what Curley was referring to . " What report ? Edward Howard ? " " Bribery . He claims I was bribed , by your friend Anselmo ! He bribed me and so I pardoned him ! Howard has affidavits . He 's going to the attorneygeneral with it . " Brady knew of no report , and his ignorance set off alarms in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had not confidedin Brady . Brady knew if he was n't to be Curley 's ally in this , he would be his patsy . " That 's impossible , Jim . Howard 's shooting from the hip . It 's not true . " " You 're damn right it 's not ! You were the one who wanted that pardon , not me . You sponsored it ! You signed it . You took the bribe , not me , and I can prove it . "  |p244Brady  did not reply for a moment . He turned the governor 's statement in his mind the way a survivor turns over the carcass of a victim . " How ? " Brady asked icily . " An affidavit of my own . Jack Hurley 's . You told him about it . " " That 's a lie . " " We 'll see , Brady . We 'll see . We 'll see who they impeach . Your plot has backfired . " " Governor , you 're talking nonsense . If there 's a plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them . . . " " They already have ! " Curley said pathetically . Suddenly his eyes were filled with tears . Brady thought he was going to cry . But he held himself in check , if barely , only swaying slightly as he stared . His stung countenancesaid it all : " I know , Brady , that you think I 'm vulgar , that I embarrassyou , that you ca n't wait to shunt me aside . You are even worse than they are . You want to be one of them ! " Yes , Brady thought . The irony of it sliced through him . Brady , who regarded his own people with a caustic eye , would never betray them . He wanted to be like the Brahmin , yes . But not so much that he would finallyrepudiate the Irish . Curley , on the other hand , embodied the Irish and loved them , but he would do anything in his pursuit of power , even hand over his own to Beacon Hill Brit bloodhounds . " This is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm through with you . You 're finished . " " No , I 'm not . I 'll fight you on this . " " Go ahead . I 'm going to Howard . " " To offer him me . " " Yes . " " And a Republican on the council to take my place after it votes me out . " " Yes . " Brady considered it . Howard would accept . Such a deal would give them back the majority for the rest of Curley 's term and , more importantly , for the new governor 's term as well . " Hurley , " Brady said . " You 'll back him for governor ? " " Yes . " " I 'm beginning to get the picture . Hurley would swear to anything for a time at bat . But what happened ? This morning you were backing me for mayor . " Curley said nothing . " You were going to fight Howard on the bribe flimflam all the way , were n't you ? Until they did their number on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to cut and run and cover yourself . You 've let them get to you , Jim . " " No , Colman . Only to you . " " I could take you out with me . I could hang the real thing on you , and you know it . " " But you wo n't . For the same reason you wo n't let me make a fool of myself out there . " Brady smiled faintly , containing his rage and hurt inside his manners . The old bastard knew him inside and out . The English were still the English . His own were still his own . Curley was right . " I know the difference , Colman , between your loyalty and your embar-rassment . " " I doubt it , Governor . " Colman was in fact surprised by his own loyalty , as he was surprised by Curley 's total lack of it . Colman had , for all his planning , been careless , very careless . It was difficult for him to admit that , but it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could come from nowhere . Brady would rather be a cause of his own downfall than a mere witness to it . " You remind me of someone , Governor . " " Who ? " " Eamon de Valera . " " Why thank you . The President of Ireland . " " Indeed . And a traitor and a murderer of his own . " Brady struggled to keep the tremor from his voice . He did not want , even now , to give Curley a scene with which to shock Harvard . Brady would not let his own pain be a prop in another of Curley 's displays . Curley shrugged . " I do n't know about that . " " I think you do . " They stared at each other for a long moment . The beefy young marshal interrupted them , coming from around the pillar and into the alcove . " Here 's your bourbon , Governor . " " Why , thank you , son . Thank you . " Curley took the glass with a bow , then raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor say as he did , " Here 's to your health , son , and that of Fair Harvard . " Brady was making his way across the rotunda toward the door , through the rainbow of gowns and hoods , when Madeline Gardner Thomson caught his sleeve . " I found out who you are . " " Who am I ? " Brady smiled charmingly . There was a lead cover on his emotions.  | " You 're on the governor 's council . " " I have been , but I wo n't be for long . " " Why ? " " Wait a week . Then ask your husband . " " You 're a very cryptic man . " " I 'm a Druid , Mrs. Thomson . " " Oh . " She paused . " Well , I 'm sorry you 're not a gardener . " " Why ? " " Because you left your ax at my house that time . I thought you might need it . I was going to invite you to come and pick it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need it after all . " " Do come for it , then . We could finish that drink . " " I 'd love to . " " Good . Call me before you come . " " All right . " Their coy exchange was another lie . Brady knew that he would not call her or see her or accept her invitation . They held each other 's eyes for a moment , then Brady turned and continuedacross the hall . As he slipped between two robed figures , one of them turned around , his face nearly touching Brady 's . It was Abbott Lawrence Lowell . He nodded at Brady and might have spoken to him , but Brady , fearing that he was going to break , pressed by Lowell and made for the great doorway . He left Widener without looking back and he channeled his emotion into his plunge down the long stairs , which he took two at a time . The ambition he had nurtured and fed on since coming to Boston had just been destroyed . His own career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . And not only that , to have been done in by Curley who owed him so much and who had seemed so nearly impotent ! To have been done in at Harvard in one of its alcoves ! Brady was ravaged . Each time his foot struck the stone , his weight jammed down and sent a shock to his brain . The series of jolts punished him like the slaps of a parent . Why was he not weeping ? If he did n't then , he knew he never would . He babbled inside , ranting and accusing not Curley , but himself , thus assuming that his defeat , unlike all the others , was total and in some way permanent . To think he had expected a life not wasted  --  the nerve of him ! A life not alone  --  what a fool he was ! His great mistake had been in not preparing for the worst . Was he Irish for nothing ? ColmanBrady was too Irish and not Irish enough . Two weeks to the day later , Colman Brady was formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willful impropriety in the matter of the pardon of one Gennaro Anselmo . Brady denied the charge but did not defend himself.  |p247Anselmo  's pardon stood . Three days after his impeachment , Colman Brady was approached by Gennaro Anselmo . Rosa Imports and various other of the Sicilian 's enterprises were bringing in more capital than the North End operations could profitably recirculate . Anselmo needed a discreet , trustworthy and non-Italian associate to invest such monies in legal sectors of business . He asked Brady if he would help him in this way . Brady said he would . A week later , Colman Brady bought a large colonial house in Brookline , and a week after that , over their vehement protests , he moved Micko , Maeve , and her kids , Jackie , Maureen , and Deirdre , out of the three-decker on Fourth Street in South Boston.  | " WHAT I WANT TO KNOW , " Jack McShane said , " is why you dress to the nines to go to the fights ? " He replaced his cup on its saucer . The three McShanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing dinner . They were at the oval table in the breakfast room where they took their meals when the entire family was n't eating . It was a low-ceilinged room with a great black Carpenter stove against one wall . The mild chill of an early spring evening blew through the open window . " You 're from B.C. , " Colman answered from the doorway . " You would n't understand . " Brady sipped at his bourbon , leaned against the will and laughed . He hooked a thumb in the cummerbund of his tuxedo and felt its pressure against his waist , which was , for the first time in his life , thicker than he wanted . He was forty-two years old . " At B.C. , Unc , we would n't dignify boxing like that . Only Harvard could think up Fight Night . " " Have you expressed your views to your beloved cousin ? " " Joe Louis ? Do I look like Arturo Godoy ? He 'd kill me . " " No , he would n't , Jack , " Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in the midst of her first bloom , pretty and bright . She worked as a stenographer in one of her uncle 's offices . " You should n't make . light of Micko . Not tonight . He could get hurt . " " He wo n't get hurt , darling , " Colman said . " I agree with Jack , " Deirdre said , waving her napkin . A fair , soft girl of twenty-two , a bit overheavy , with fattish Irish features , she was a nursingstudent at Newton College of the Sacred Heart . " He could get hurt . You should n't allow it , Uncle Colman . " " lie 's a big boy . " " He 's a Harvard man ! " Jack said , forefinger raised . " I do n't boss you blokes around . Why should I Micko ? " Brady sipped his drink . " Besides . . . " " Boxing is manly ! " Jack said . There was more than a hint of bitterness in the remark . Jack was a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had already decided to enter the seminary after graduation.  | " Feeling pretty pugnacious , are n't you , kiddo ? " Colman was n't going to be drawn into that tangle again . Jack 's resentment of his cousin was habitual , palpable and enormous . Collins was at Harvard . Already , in his sophomore year , he was a class officer , an honor student , and a finalist in the collegiate boxing tournament . " ' Scuse me , Mr. Brady . " Clara , the cook , a black woman of fifty , pressed by Brady into the small dining room . She carried a tray with three dishes of ice cream and a plate of cookies on it . Brady made way for her , raising his glass high so that she could pass under it , a broad maternal barge under a Mississippi bridge . " Clara , we should have eaten here ; I 'm certain of it . " " What they gon na serve , Mr. Brady ? " " Watercress and baby crackers . " When he smiled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischievously . Stringy lines encasedhis eyes . Colman planted his drink hand in the upper right corner of the door frame , anchoring the bridge . He spread his stance across the threshold and pressed his strength against the wood . In that posture he could feel his house solid beneath him and permanent over him . A snug , safe feeling ; he loved it . The house was a stately nineteenth-century mansion of thirteen rooms , including Clara 's on the fourth floor , in the Brookline quarter known as Cottage Farm . The other houses on Prescott Street were equally large and graceful . Directly behind Brady 's was the massive Tudor manor house in which Lawrences had lived , summers , eighty years before . Brady would have liked more land ; his corner lot was less than half an acre . In good weather he cared for the modest lawn himself as if to fancy farming still . Like a farmer he still needed to love what surrounded him . In that house he did ; the crafted , proud things , the high rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fireplaces . Brady loved his own room , in which he had his desk , his chair , his hearth , his bed , his books , the simple things enclosed there which pleased him enormously . In the house on Prescott Street Brady had found rooms that could hold his solitude and his love . The house was a guarantor that all was well with him and his family . Shelter . He pictured them asleep and vulnerable . Safe . He sipped his drink . What the hell , he thought . The kids were all grown up . Even Micko . Maureen was touching a spoonful of ice cream with her tongue . Brady noted her fine ripeness again , proudly . Jack was fastidious with his dessert , seeming to ponder each bite as if it held a secret . Deirdre said , " Mom 's late . "  |p253Brady  looked at his watch . It was true . " She does n't want to go , " Deirdre announced . Jack and Maureen ate ice cream . " Of course she does , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . " " In confidence , no doubt , " Jack lobbed . " She hates boxing , " Deirdre explained . " This is a very big night for Micko . Your mother appreciates that . She would n't miss it for anything . " " She also hates dressing up . " Deirdre was irked and vengeful . She had a streak of pettiness in her that Colman disliked . He determined not to be haired . " Why are you saying these things to me , Dee ? " " Will you please not call me ' Dee ' ? " " Deirdre . " " Because you should not let Collins fight . He 'll get hurt . " " Strange , darling , but I was getting the feeling of more from you than love of your brother . " " My cousin . " Brady stared his niece down . " The thing is , anyway , " Maureen began ingenuously , " college boxers do n't hurt each other . Only the professionals . . . " Her statement hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . It occurred to Brady that they were miffed because they could n't go to the match , which was open only to members  --  the Harvard Club was for alumni , faculty , and officers of the university  --  and to the parents of the athletes . " Anyway , we 'll all celebrate together later , eh ? If the laddo wins ? " " What do you mean if he wins ? " Jack said gamely . " Of course he 'll win ! What can they have in Cambridge to compare with a tough mick from Southie ? Tell the punk good luck , Unc ! " " I will , Jack . " Clara entered to clear the table , but before she had picked up a plate , there came from the stairs the rustle of cloth they had been waiting for . Maeve made her entrance with a floating stiffness . She achieved , quite unpurposefully , a shy dignity . Her dress was black and shiny , silk , yet modest , demure . She was very large in it , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their bland flesh , loads of it , was not her best feature . She was forty-seven and still handsome in an unsexual way . A forthright , plain-featured woman , whose humor and character gave her a soft shine like a figure lit from behind . But she should not have displayedher upper arms.  | " A cigarette ! I need a cigarette ! " she said , dispelling the embarrassmentshe felt at being tricked out in gauds . Her son offered her one and lit it . " Well ? " She turned around for them . Though her entrance had preempted their response , she was hurt that no one had complimented her . " Beautiful , Mother ! " Maureen said , and set about straightening a rear pleat in the ankle-length gown . Maeve was looking at her son . " Beautiful ! Gorgeous ! " he said , smoking . Colman touched her elbow . " The best , darling . The best ! " " A knockout , eh ? " Maeve turned again . " A knockout for Fight Night at . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't B.C. , " Jack piped . " Bully for B.C. , " Maeve said . " Think of it that way : us against them ! " She made a fist and mimed a punch . " Come on , Micko ! Land one for our side ! " " That 's the trouble , Mom , " Jack said . " When they 're both from Harvard , which side is our side ? " " You and your metaphysics . Did you all eat ? Did you give them the lamb , Clara ? " " Yes 'm . ' Bout half of it . " " Wrap what 's left . Maybe we 'll have it tomorrow . " " Yes 'm . " " We should go , Maeve . " " I 'm ready . What was the large discussion about down here ? " No one answered . " I guess it was mice at each other that I overheard . " " No one was ' at each other , ' Maeve , " Colman said . He put his glass down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coat . Maeve was staring hard at Deirdre . " Did you tell him what I said ? " Deirdre toyed with her spoon miserably . Maeve gave her daughter a devastating look and moved her lips silently around the words , " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph . " Colman returned with her coat , which he held for her . She stepped into it a side at a time . " Now , the threesome of you , " she said briskly , " I want you to do the kitchen . " She turned and called , " Clara , your night off , no ? " " Never mind me , Miss McShane , you just . . . " You never mind . Get out of that kitchen . All right , you three , somethingdecent for a change . . . " " Let 's go , girls ! " Jack said , hopping to.  |p255Each  one kissed Maeve on the cheek . Colman stood in the short hall that held the telephone and led to the entrance foyer . When Maeve joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held open the door to the big black Packard . Maeve paused , shivering still with indignation . " A young woman to whom God has been unkind , Colman , how savage she can be ! She knew I did n't want her to tell you that . " " Maeve , God has been far from unkind to Dee . " " Do n't tell me she 's done that to herself . She resents beauty and harm . " She got in the car . Colman slid in on his side . " No wonder she 's so difficult with you , then . " You dragoon ! " She smiled at him . When they were out of the driveway and headed for Commonwealth Avenue , she added weightily , " Resentment is a poor prop for anyone to kin on . " Colman shrugged . Deirdre was n't his problem . At Commonwealth he turned east toward town instead of west toward c al n bridge . " Why are you going this way , Colman ? Harvard is . . . " The Harvard Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's one of their st rets . They have their places everywhere . " The house of the Harvard Club of Boston was an imposing classical building of granite and brick . Its entrance was just muted enough to be overlooked in a block that was bookended by two grand hotels , the Somerset and the Eliot , and otherwise dominated by several private ostentationswhich blatantly violated the understatement of the Back Bay . The Harvard edifice , built in 1913 , lifting nearly a hundred feet , achieved a symmetry of Doric windows at three levels . In its center directly over the first floor balcony was the seal of the College  --  Ve-ri-tas  --  in marble , and below that the crimson flag fluttered , announcing a club function . Colman and Maeve left their car with the valet and joined the line of gowned women and tuxedoed men filing into the house . The interior was dark , with wood panels on the walls and ceilings . Skillfully carved dentils and scrolls , not the mimicry of plaster , elaborated the pillars and lintels , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colman took his sister 's coat and handed it to the young woman at the cloakroom . Then they joined the line moving slowly toward Harvard Hall at the far ide of the lobby . A man at a desk received each couple , checked their tickets and handed them a program . Brady 's tickets were marked " Guests , " but the man did not bat . " A Formal Evening of Boxing , " read the program . The lettering was inp256simple red ink . Colman opened his and found , on the evening 's list of bouts , the one he wanted ; " For the Collegiate Championship , Phelps Otis ( ' 41 ) vs . M. Collins Brady ( ' 42 ) . " There it is , look . " Maeve nodded , though she did not see her nephew 's name . There were five bouts listed . At the entrance to Harvard Hall they waited for the maitre d ' to return from seating the couple ahead of them . The hall was a stunning contradiction , a cavernous expanse reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center one of which shone down spotlights on a raised square canvas-covered platform , which was bordered by three lengths of rope . Around the boxing ring were arranged dozens of tables elegantly set with linen , silver , and crystal . Maeve could not imagine nearly naked men standing in the midst of such opulence hitting each other . She resisted a sudden queasy sickness by finding Colman 's hand and sliding her own into it . The maitre d ' seated them at a table for four at the far west side of the room by a large fireplace . " Bad seats , " Colman muttered . But Maeve was relieved . No sooner had they placed their napkins in their laps than the maitre d ' appeared again , ushering another couple to their table . Colman stood . " Hello there ! " the man said with a great affability . " I guess you 're stuck with us ! " He was an old man , bent slightly over a cane , with a swarthy head of tousled white hair . He wore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huge cotton bridges , made impossible demands on the rest of his face . " Not at all , " Brady said . " Delighted . " He held a chair ready , and the old man stepped aside for his wife . " Deborah , this is my wife , Deborah . " She smiled a bit shyly . She was younger than her husband , perhaps sixty , and wearing a slightly too youthful green velvet dress with a highthroatedcollar . " I 'm Fritz Amory . " " Good evening , Mr. Amory . I am Colman Brady . This is my sister , Mrs. McShane . " " Well , is n't that great ! Brother and sister ! Are n't you two the pair ! I 'm Class of Eighty-one . " " Indeed . " Colman let it pass and resumed his chair . " Well , " Fritz Amory said , " how about you ? What year ? " " I 'm not an alumnus , Mr. Amory , " Brady said through the smoke of his thin cigar . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that right ? " The old man was impressed . " Which one ? " Colman pointed to Collins 's name in Amory 's program . " Well , I 'll be ! The championship ! That 's stupendous ! Look here , Deborah . M. Collins Brady . ' Is n't that marvelous ? Well , Mr. Brady , it 's an honor to be at your table . " " Thank you , sir . And at yours . " The waiter slid dishes of steaming consomme madrilene in front of each , and each began serenely to spoon at the warmth . " It 's a wonderful event , Fight Night , " Amory announced . " Deborah and I have been coming for years . Would n't miss it . We love it , do n't we , peaches ? " Mrs. Amory looked at Maeve , who construed her glance , rightly , to mean she hated it . " Fritz says it builds character . " " That 's what my brother says . " The two women smiled knowingly at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you , Mr. Brady ? " " No . I was a hurler . " " A what ? " " Hurling . A sort of Gaelic field hockey . " " Aha ! Gaelic ! You 're Irish . " " I am . " Fritz Amory reached over the table to put his hand on Colman 's arm . " I admire your country , Mr. Brady . It 's been a great struggle , has n't it ? The Independence . " " I think of this as my country , Mr. Amory . " " Of course you do . I meant . . . " " You 're right . It has been a struggle there . A terrible beauty . " " Yeats . " " Yes . " " I 'm a writer myself . " " Are you , Mr. Amory ? " Maeve asked . " What sort of writing do you do ? " " Plays , Mrs. McShane . I 'm a playwright . Broadway plays , that sort of thing . " " Well , that 's marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I suspect not , ma'am . I had a show at the Theatre de Lys once , but it had , shall we say , an economical run . " Maeve was toying with the lemon slice in her soup when she said , " They say it 's awfully difficult to make a living as a writer these days . " Colman touched his napkin to his lips . Clearly Amory 's main occupation , however he described himself , had been watching over the family fund.  | " Oh , it is , yes . It is . Writing is a damnable profession . I despise it . What do you do , Mr. Brady ? " " Insurance , Mr. Amory . " " Oh ? What firm ? " " My own . Monument Municipal , it 's called . " " I do n't know it , but that does n't mean anything . I admire business . Great excitement in business these days . I 've been thinking about doing a play about it . What do you think ? " Brady laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monotonous . ' Not much seems to happen . You should write plays about ships , like O'Neill . " " I already have a ship play . I call it The Fog People ! " " Or a play about boxing , " Maeve said . " Now there 's an idea ! Is n't that a good idea , peaches ? We must pay close attention tonight . " " You could draw on your own experience , sir . " " By Jove , Mr. Brady , you 're right ! And I could meet your son , perhaps ? " " Of course . " " I never had a son . Always wanted one . " Peaches dropped her eyes . Maeve wanted to touch her . " Would have gone to the College , " Amory went on , oblivious . " You must be pleased . " " I am , sir . Harvard is a fine school . " " More than that ! More than that ! " The old man thumped the table , glistened , having left his grief behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's embarrassing , but I 'll tell you anyway . After all these years  --  and it 's too damn many  --  I look back on the College and , well , that was it for me . Absolutely the peak . I loved it . I was a boxer . And the Pudding . I love these things , reunions . Would n't miss it . " Amory paused , looked at his wife , and had a new thought . " Well , not the absolute peak . That was my wife . Meeting her . " The palpable love passing silently between the old couple moved Brady . " Of course , " Amory said . " Peaches was n't even born when I was at Harvard . Were you , dear ? " " Would you believe it ? There was a time when I was n't born . " Mrs. Amory laughed . Brady studied them , thinking of decay . His mind flicked from the fact of theirs to that of his own . He dispelled the sudden grim mood by leaningaway from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if I smoke ? " It was gauche to smoke between courses.  | " Of course not. , , Brady lit a cigarette and flipped the match into the center of the modestfire that burned in the large hearth a few feet away from them . " Can you read that ? " Amory asked . He pointed to a Latin verse inscribedon the hearthstone . Before Brady could reply , Amory was translatinghaltingly . " Dissolve ' Dissolve the winter cold . Super Foco Large , with large or , better , plenteous  --  logs laid on the hearth , 0 Thaliarchus . Not bad , eh ? " " Very good , " Brady cheered . The old man laughed delightedly . Brady urged him to continue . " And draw from  --  deprome  --  the cask  --  benignius  --  benignly , no , generously ! Quadrimum Sabina . I ca n't imagine what that is . The fourth Sabine . What the blazes ? " " Perhaps , " Brady said tentatively , snapping his ash toward the fire , " the four-year-old Sabine wine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the stone like a puzzle . " Yes . Certainly . You know the Sabine wine in Horace . " " Horace ? Is that Horace ? " " It is . " " I 'll be damned . " Amory raised his wineglass to toast Brady . Brady raised his own glass and said , " To the hearthstone which is an altar of the safe and grateful warmth which nourishes hospitality , good fellowship , and friendship . " " Indeed so , Mr. Brady . Indeed so . " He leaned over to his wife and made a show of whispering , " Is n't he splendid ? " During the several courses that followed  --  sauteed sweetbreads , duck , vegetables , and cheeses  --  the Amorys and Colman and Maeve carried on like good friends . There was an ease between them that no one could have anticipated . All Fritz Amory knew was that for once at a damn reunion he was n't being made to feel defensive by some doctor or lawyer about how he 'd spent his life . A bell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire from the tips of cigars flitted about the hall when the lights were lowered , all but the spots on the boxingring beneath the huge center chandelier . " Ladies and gentlemen , " a man with a shining bald pate said from the microphone at ringside , " welcome to the Harvard Club 's Evening of Boxing ! Tonight 's referee is George Kimball , Twenty-seven . I refer you to your program . The evening 's first bout is the Harry Anderson Memorial Competition . " Two boys climbed into the ring , not even of college age . After furtherp260announcements and introductions , the bells rang and the boys came out fighting . That is , they came out for long periods of malevolent stalking , punctuated by instants of wild flailing that seemed mutually calculated to be as brief and painless as possible . " They 're children , " Maeve whispered . Horrified as she was , she could not take her eyes off the ring . She was feeling giddy from the wine . She was smoking , but many of the women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys ' Clubs , that sort of thing . " " I hate it . " Several bouts followed , each one longer than the other . After the Golden Gloves fight there were two semiprofessional bouts between bantams , who fought with a fierceness at once brutal and detached , as though the fifty-dollar prize were everything and nothing . But the bouts of the night were between the Harvard men . The fourth event was the Harvard Club Consolation between the boxers who 'd been eliminated in the tournamentsemifinals . Theirs was a sluggish , boring fight . Both men had alreadybeen beaten and their defeat was palpable . Who has ever fought heartfully for the consolation ? By the time the bald man announced the final bout  --  " Ladies and gentlemen , for the Championship of Harvard College ! "  --  the four hundred and twenty ladies and gentlemen were ready for it . They had been mellow and subdued through the early contests , rewarding welllandedpunches with applause , but not shouting particularly or leaving their chairs . The preliminary bouts had been just that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a contest for huzzahs . In the ironic tradition of Harvard athletics , Fight Night always achieved two things at once : a spirited and self-mocking satire as well as a damned fine match between excellent athletes . " In the white boxing trunks , Class of Forty-one , and first runner-up in nineteen thirty-nine , from Peabody , Massachusetts , Phelps Otis . " A broad young man of average height with dark black hair trimmed short bounced down the aisle from the lobby to the ring . He wore a crimsonrobe . The people applauded vigorously . " You know who he is , do n't you ? " Mr. Amory said . " No . " " That 's Wave Otis 's nephew . " " The Speaker ? " Brady asked . Wysten Waverly Otis had housemanagedthe bill against Curley in 1933 . He had retired when Curley was governor . " And , " the announcer blared , " in the dark trunks , Class of Forty-two , from Brookline , Massachusetts , M. Collins Brady ! " The applause was equally vigorous.  |p261Brady  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man with bushy brown hair and a huge smile , wearing a robe like Otis 's , walked slowly into the hall and up to the ring . He did not hurry or jog . The poise with which he entered made his father think , despite himself , that by God the kid looked like a champion . Upon entering the ring Collins nodded at the crowd and then at Otis as if they were friends . And then , while listening to the referee drone the usual rules , young Brady 's eyes began to cross the crowd . He could not see past the first few rows of tables , but Colman saw him looking and , knowing , began to wave wildly . " Sit down , Colman , " Maeve said , tugging at his sleeve . " He ca n't see you way back here . " " He 's got the other bloke on size , does n't he ? " " He does , " Amory said . " Your boy looks the stronger . My money 's on him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat . " Call me Fritz now , wo n't you ? " Collins was still trying to pick his father out of the crowd when he returned to his corner to await the bell . He leaned against the ropes , barely listening to what his second was telling him . His second was a short young man who wore a white sweater with the red " H " on its breast . The bell rang . A modest roar of interest went up from the crowd . Otis and Brady approached each other similarly ; circling in small , glidingsteps , each moving opposite his opponent 's crooked left arm , each one 's left elbow down in front of his left ribs , each one 's left hand extendedshoulder-high a foot , each one 's right hand cocked back below his right cheek ready to attack or defend . Otis had his chin pressed down on his chest bone . Brady 's chin was thrust forward . His father was instantly aware of this flaw in his stance and alarmed by it . Bad coaching . The chin must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy target too and moved in on it . Unlike Brady 's , Otis 's head had no singular action of its own , did not bob or weave , but worked along with his entire body . A shorter man , more solid than lean , he ( couched forward in what Colman saw even from the rear of the room was a left feint before a hook . Colman was on his feet . " Get your chin down ! " he wanted to yell . " Get your chin down ! " Otis stepped inside Brady and exploded upward , leading with his left hand in a skillful , perfectly timed attack against Collins 's chin , which hung in the air like a clay pigeon . Collins looked inept and vulnerable , Otis smart and quick.  |p262Otis  's glove smashed in on its target . The force of the blow could have jarred Brady to the point of finishing him . But the left hook missed . Brady 's chin was gone . He had drawn it in at the last possible instant and Otis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook to Brady 's chin , Brady was driving a low right cross into Otis 's midsection . His blow landed . He buried his glove in his opponent 's stomach and the crowd could hear Otis 's grotesque intake of breath . Brady had given Otis the false lead of his chin . Otis had taken it . Brady had scored , a brilliant move , a great opening . The crowd applauded . Colman cheered , remaining on his feet . Otis backed off . Brady , with his chin firmly on his chest , moved in on him , leading with his left , jabbing and stepping back ; jabbing and stepping back again  --  a classic tactic against a shorter opponent . It allowed Brady the full advantage of his superior height and reach . Jab and step back . Forward , jab , and back . An elegant sequence of moves ; this Brady was a boxer . The bell rang . The three minutes had seemed like seconds . The boxers retreated to their corners . Colman Brady sat down and reached for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jove , Brady ! " Amory said . " What a boxer ! Splendid boxer ! " " Is n't he great ? " Colman looked at Maeve , who was nervously lighting a cigarette . Her weak eyes told him she had nothing to say . But she spoke nonetheless . " How many rounds ? " " Seven more . " " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! " " He 'll be fine . " " What about the other fellow ? Are we supposed to pray Micko kills him ? " " Now , Maeve , stop it . " " Do n't now ' me ! This entire thing is perverse . Your son is their gladiator . " The bell rang . The boxers engaged immediately . Otis drew Brady 's left lead as the latterattempted to resume his tactic of jabbing and stepping back . But that was a mistake on Brady 's part , too predictable . Now Otis was ready for it and , having drawn the lead , he slipped inside it , crouching forward andp263bringing both hands upward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone into a clinch at once , but he tried to back off , allowing Otis to continue his rapid hitting in close pursuit . Otis had employed the lassic infight tactic against an opponent who is taller . By the time Brady slid his gloves around Otis 's waist to end the assault it was an act more of desperation than skill . The bell rang . Round two to Otis . The applause was vigorous and sustained as the men went back to their corners . No one at the table spoke . The Amorys were embarrassed by Maeve 's outburst . Maeve was trying to decide whether to leave altogether or wait for her brother in the lobby . Colman was worried about the fight . Micko had blown the round badly , not out of lack of skill or strength , but out of cockiness . Otis had landed solid , damaging punches to the boy 's body . And now Micko was sitting on his stool visibly stunned and , instead of listening to his second or concentrating on Otis across the ring , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his father . Colman recognized the look in his eye  --  it was born of the old pathetic fear that his father was displeased . " Do n't think about me , kiddo ! " Colman wanted to yell . " Think about him ! " The bell rang . Collins Brady was slower coming out this time . Otis carried the fight to him . Now more and more of the crowd was on its feet . At a table near ringsidesomeone knocked a wine bottle to the floor and its crash was audible above the fight noises . An elderly man at a table near Brady was yelling , " Smash him , Phelps ! Smash him , Phelps ! " Otis lunged forward toward Brady 's chin , which was exposed again . Only this time it remained exposed to Otis 's strongest and best blow , a straight right , which he threw with all he had , leaving himself wide open if this was another Brady feint . But it was not . All of Otis 's weight was on his forward left foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When the punch landed , Brady 's two feet left the floor as he crashed down backward , slamming the canvas with his tailbone and then his head . The bell rang . " Stop it ! " Maeve screamed at Colman over the noise . " I ca n't . I ca n't . " " He 's only up there because of you ! " " That 's not true . " It was true . " They 'll kill him ! They 'll kill him ! "  | " He 's only fighting one man , Maeve ! " But he knew what she was saying . The crowd was entirely mad now with its desire for Otis 's victory . Blood was in the air . " Dear God , it 's your son ! " " I know who it is ! Do n't you tell me who it is ! " " Stop it , Colman ! " " Woman , you stop it ! I ca n't ! " Maeve hurled her wrung napkin at him and stood and bolted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amory whispered to his wife , " Is n't that the saddest thing you ever saw ? I could just weep for them . " Maeve made her way as quickly as she could to the women 's lounge . As she pushed the door open she heard the bell clang and she groaned aloud . In the lounge another woman was seated in a low chair at the great mirror , hunched over . She had long blond hair and wore an amber velvet dress with a deep scoop down the back that made her appear slightly too naked , altogether vulnerable . Maeve was so struck by her that , for a moment she forgot herself and her nephew . The woman raised her head , displaying in the mirror the wreckage of her mascara . She had been weeping . Her brows , pencil thin , were smeared down into the dark pools of her lids . Her face was etched . " Is n't it awful ? " she said to Maeve . Her voice was raspy and deep . Maeve nodded , barely controlling herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that boy , " the woman said . Maeve looked at her sharply . " Which one ? " " The Irish boy . Brady . " " You know him ? " " Yes . " " They 're killing him . " " I know it . I know it . " " I 've never seen such vicious evil people , never , " said Maeve . The woman turned away from the mirror to look at Maeve in the flesh . " I ca n't help noticing your accent . You 're Irish . " Maeve nodded . The bell rang . And it rang again . Instead of stopping after its first sharp report , it continued to clang for some seconds . The roar of the crowd was louder than ever . The two women went into the lobby and listened.  | " The winner , by technical knockout , in two minutes , eleven seconds of the fourth round , Phelps Otis ! " Everyone in Harvard Hall was on his feet applauding . Suddenly Collins Brady , his shoulders draped with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in his corner , burst into the lobby from the hall . He walked briskly toward the stairs that led down to the squash courts and locker rooms . There was blood on his face and his hair was matted , obscuring his eyes , but he seemed all right . He walked within ten feet of Maeve . It was not clear whether he did not see her or was ignoring her . " Oh , dear God , " Maeve said after he had passed . Tears came into her eyes . The woman with her pressed her arm reassuringly . Phelps Otis , waving and smiling , came out of the hall . The applause and whistling were deafening . As he crossed the lobby to the stairs , accompanied by his second and followed by the referee , he waved at the two women . They only stared at him . Colman Brady was the first one out after the boxers . He nearly bumped into Maeve on his way across the lobby . He was going after Collins . " Maeve ! " She had rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maeve was with his jaw dropped . " Mrs. Thomson ! " " Mr. Brady . " Maeve removed Madeline Thomson 's hand from her arm . " You 've met ? " Colman asked . " Met ? " Madeline was as confused as he was . She looked at Maeve , whose glare was fixed on Brady . " Are you with him ? " Madeline asked . " Yes . " Maeve did not look at her . " Oh , God , " Madeline said , closing her eyes , bridging her forehead with her thumb and finger , a dramatic , affected gesture . " I apologize , Mrs. Brady . . . " " Not Mrs. Brady , " Maeve said . " The boy is my nephew , though his fatheris no brother of mine . " With that , Maeve turned abruptly and headed against the crowd into the hall to retrieve her purse . Colman and Madeline stood facing each other as the swirl of fans made its way in eddies past them . " You came with your husband . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodded and looked at him directly . She did not look away in an in/stant as women usually did . There was nothing coy in her at that moment . " Your son is all right . " " I know . " " I saw him looking for you . I knew you 'd be here . " Colman shrugged . " Is your wife with you ? " " My wife is dead . " Madeline Thomson did not reply to that . " She 's been dead for eighteen years . " " You must have been very young . " Brady nodded . Perhaps it was the rare explicit reference to Nellie that did it . He found himself drawn inextricably into Mrs. Thomson 's gaze . Her ruined eyes held him . He realized she had been weeping . For Micko ? She lowered her eyes . He dropped his , allowing them to fall along the lines of her body . The amber dress showed her breasts . Her figure was alluring , youthful . He guessed she was forty , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her once as an aging flapper . Now she reminded him of Nell . " I told you I would visit you . For my ax . " " I believed you . I wanted you to come . " " There 's never enough time . It passes quickly . " " Does n't it ? " She raised her chin at him , leading with it , recalling Micko 's feint , Micko 's error . She had a wonderful chin , a perfect tight neck . The wrinkles of her face and throat were too fine to add anything but texture to her skin . " Do you still live in Beverly ? " He could feel his caution evaporating . " Pride 's Crossing . " " Might I . . . ? " He let the question hang . Would she require a more circuitous approach ? Apparently not , because she nodded , then said softly , " Please do . " She turned and retreated into the women 's lounge . He forced his way through the crowd to the stairs leading down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low bench , his head back , face up to an attendant who was applying Merthiolate to a one-inch cut inside his mouth . His left eye was swollen purple . Otis had finished him off with a series of sharp blows to the face that so bloodied him the referee had intervened . His eyes were closed . Colman put his hand on the back of his son 's neck and pressed gently.  |p267The  boy opened his eyes . " Oh , Dad . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . " Colman leaned down to kiss him on the brow , " Son , you showed real courage . That 's what counts . " The boy 's eyes were overflowing , which only made his self-loathing sharper . Colman stroked the flesh in back of his son 's neck . " I was proud of you , amico . " ON THE TIP of Eastern Point in Gloucester there was a modest weathered pavilion to which the residents of the peninsula went in summer for band concerts . In early April the large houses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , twin to the fog which clung to the glistening low shrubbery . Colman Brady waited for Madeline Gardner Thomson to appear . He leaned with his back to the ocean against a slatted bench and watched the road . The only movements were the undulations of the gray sea , of which he was only vaguely aware , and the sharp darting of wet gulls , which made periodic demands on his attention . The gulls were feeding on crabs left behind helpless by the tide . Once they chewed the legs away from the body they lifted the impenetrable shell to a height of fifty or seventy feet and dropped it , swooping down afterward to see if the fall had given them the crack they needed . The ingenuity of hunger . Time seemed to Brady like a shell that refused to split . He refused to look at his watch , but still saw the slow , silent sweep that , over and over , traced its pattern precisely , achieving in her absence an exquisite futility . They had arranged their rendezvous when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to receive him at her home after all . He proposed the pavilion . She knew the place . Meeting there meant a plunge directly into the surreptitious , and her willingness excited him and made him anxious . " When shall we meet then ? " he had asked , thinking , Perhaps this afternoon . " A week from Thursday , " she 'd said , crushing him . And novv no sign of her.  |p268What  woman could charm him away from that incomprehensible world in which he lived ? Why had he allowed the impassioned hope of his youth to bubble up again , leaving him motionless and disengaged , gazing at a figure in his mind , hers , and thinking perhaps there are oases after all ? The week and a half since she 'd given her promise had been filled with a happiness . He had been thinking continually , I will be with her . As long as she did not come he had the pleasure of his own highly concentrated anticipation . Even as he stared down the misty road it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coming would be somehow deflating . He was absorbed . In such a state of mind , satisfaction and resolutionwere not to be hoped for  --  only the prolongation of this new feeling . He had harbored nothing like it before , not even with Nellie , unless the haze across his memory misled him . With Nellie there had been desire and anticipation  --  he could summon those still by picturing her naked on the floor before the fire  --  but never this unsettling , paralyzing expectation which invests everything in the future , thereby destroying the present and , peculiarly , thereby making the present more intensely felt than ever . What woman ? What woman could charm him away from that incomprehensibleworld in which he lived ? Perhaps this one . Why ? Her modish slouch , the way her body wore its despair . The world-weariness of the young getting old . An aging woman in a gorgeous body . Her bronze and marble skin . Her confidence and brain . Brady recalled standing with her on the steps of Widener overlooking the Tercentenary . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone of the Druid tumulus looking out over the Nire Valley . Was it that Madeline and he had seen the same thing when they looked at Harvard ? Brady had seen a world of achievement and excellence which he admiredbut suspected , and in which he could never be at home . Though it was the world into which Madeline had been born , it was , he guessed , as alien to her as it was to him . She saw through its smug arrogance even more than he did . Brady recalled then standing alone in Louisburg Square overwhelmed by the perfection of it . He admitted to himself that he was attracted to this woman in exactly the way he 'd been attracted to that place . But he was meeting her because of the ways they were like each other , not different . He had been of Ireland and South Boston , and he had with an enormous unforgotten pain left them both behind . She was of Pride 's Crossing and Beacon Hill and she had  --  with like pain ?  --  left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limits , which accounted for that strength they shared and for that bottomless loneliness in the way she aimed its trembling at him , omnivo/rously , as if it would eat its object , him . He wondered if she knew of his loneliness . He lit a cigarette and watched a gull wheeling grandly overhead . In the shade of a clump of nearby bushes someone had planted fuchsias . He savored the image of Madeline Thomson standing before him in the lobby of the Harvard Club , looking pained and vulnerable . How little she seemed to change . The same radiant forehead he remembered . The same untrusting eyes . Her amber gown that night had been exactly of the season 's fashion , but still her body had kept the lines that had set her generationapart years before . It was not only that she looked young , but that she had looked young in that defiant , alluring way for years . Disturbingly unchanged , her presence that night had had the effect of delivering Brady hound at the ankles to his own past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one thing in his life about which he could do nothing . When he 'd first met Madeline years before , he 'd been laying down his planks , preparing to launch himself on Boston . He 'd been holding in check that certain expectation of influence and power , that enormous ambition that had made him young . When next he 'd seen her at the Tercentenary , that ambition had just been exploded , but inside him . Curley , the bastard , had only moments before hit him from behind , teaching him that what really matters are the things you do n't expect . But he had n't expected Madeline Thomson again either . She had taken her place by accident , by a kind of usurpation , among Brady 's shuffling litany of ghosts . He seemed incapable of severing relations with the great foils of his past  --  Collins , Nellie , Purcival , Gavin , now Curley  --  whom he carried around inside him as if he were a megalithin which the dead were buried . His ghosts were what kept Brady permanentlydisappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled him with an acute anticipation . Perhaps she was n't coming . A seagull abandoned a shell at Brady 's feet . It seemed whole . Perhaps the thing had held out , refused to crack , survivedwith its meat . Brady flicked at the shell with his toe , turning it over . There was no underside to it . The gull had feasted . No , she was n't coming , he was sure of it . She would have arrived by then . She was much too late . She was punishing him for never having called her . Why had n't he ? Furious and sad . He walked around to the front of the bench and started to sit , but thought better of it . The slats were beaded with moisture . A foghorn sounded . Brady stepped across the puddle in front of the bench ; water had collected in the depression that years of feet had made in the earth . As he stepped across it he caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection and turned back to it.  |p270He  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted that his years had not yet etched their marks on him . Or not , at least , on his body . " Good morning , Narcissus . " She was standing behind him . He straightened to face her . " Good morning , " he said . He felt almost no embarrassment that she should have witnessed his display of vanity . The top part of her face was obscured by a brown Robin Hood hat which left visible only her nose , chin and , as from within a cavern , the glint of her eye . She wore a cotton trenchcoat with an abundance of flaps and belts . The belt at her waist was fastened tightly . She wore brown leather gloves . She 's forty four , he thought . She must be . What did it matter ? Nothing . Happiness and youth have almost nothing to do with one another . " I 'm happy to see you , " he said . " I 'm glad . I 'm sorry to be late . I got lost . I looked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point . " " I did n't know what they call it out here . We always just said Gloucester . And , of course , I never drove myself . . . " " Strange , " he teased , " but you give the impression of being quite a competent woman . " " I am . I hate being lost . I hate being late . I will not take kindly to being joshed about it . " " Noted . " Brady smiled . She took her hat off . Her eyes were large and tranquil . He had expected agitation . Her hair was short , freshly cropped . She shook it out . " You 've cut your hair . " " Yes . I always do in spring . " She crushed her hat and put it in the trenchcoat pocket , leaving her hand there . She arranged her hair briefly , roughly , with her other hand , which she then put in the other pocket . Brady saw hints of gray amid the dark blond mass . The shorter hair fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was comparing the look of her to the image he 'd been savoring . She was even better in the flesh . " I 'd suggest we sit , but . . . " He gestured to the bench , its beads of water . " I 'd rather walk anyway . Do you mind ? " " Not at all . I 'd love a walk . "  | " Where shall we go ? It 's all private property . " " Well , you 're with the right fellow . Stick close to me for a lesson in the fine art of trespassing . " He put his hand briefly on her shoulder and turned her toward the road . It was the first time he 'd touched her . He could feel the blood movingunder her skin , even through her clothes . " No , " she said , pulling away from him . " The ocean . We 're at the ocean ! Let 's walk by the ocean ! " She led the way across the grass to the boulders and ledges that lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piqued , thinking if she knew where she wanted to walk why did she ask . He was n't dressed to go dancing on slipperyrocks . His street shoes , suit , and Aquascutum imposed a kind of timidity on him as he stepped from the sodden earth to the first great stone . " The center can not hold ! " she hollered back at him , throwing her arms open to the waves which rolled in . " I am loosed upon the world ! " The wind feathered her hair while she received , formally , the sullen water . Brady had not noticed how rough the sea was . As long as one stood with one 's back to the ocean  --  as he had , waiting  --  it did not exist . When one faced it , nothing else existed . Brady had to stop looking at the sea to watch where he put his feet . " It finds its own level , does n't it ? " Madeline Thomson said , sweeping the ocean with her left arm . " Do n't we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled a bit helplessly , steadying himself against the wind . " Think of the stones as clouds , " she said , " and of the spaces between as holes through which we see the earth . " " And the ocean is what ? " " The sky with green dye thrown in so that we can see the currents of the wind . " He knew her whimsy for the counterfeit it was  --  she had drawn it over her tension like a silk scarf  --  but still he was charmed . " It is useless to argue about the ocean , " she went on . " You have either sailed across it or you have n't . " She gave him a salty look . " You and I have sailed . " He watched her . She moved nimbly , youthfully , skillfully across the boulders . When he followed it was as her wake . He checked himself , remaining back . She was alone ; he was alone . That required that they move singly across the scape , each with his own footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he felt it suddenly  --  with his own burden . He put the thought away . Grim romance . Young Werther.  | " Stop ! " he said , catching her . " Let 's sit . " They leaned back against a rock and faced the sea . He continued to hold her arm , could feel a slight shiver coursing through it . " Who are you , anyway ? " he asked . " I am , as you know , Madeline Gardner , born in Boston of approved parents , well bred and round in the rump , sure prey of the slow virus of quick madness that breeds in the quarries of middle age . " " Oh . " " And you are Colman O'Murphy from over there . " She nodded toward Portugal . " Aye . Born in winter at the right time for hearing stories by the fire . Which is why I know the difference between dreams and lies . " " And which would this be ? " " Neither , yet . " She laughed . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't do anything too much . " " Too bad . " " I 've always thought so . " " You do n't seem Irish . You hold your fancy in check . " " Unlike yourself . " " I owe it all to my analyst . " When she said this it was as if a gull wheeled down too close to him and then flew away . " But I am Irish , nonetheless . " " How is your son ? " " Recovered . A triumph of pride . " " You should n't allow him to fight . " " It 's the sport of kings . " " That 's racing , I thought . " " No matter . The sport is in watching someone lose . Anyone . At any-thing . " " It should reassure us , I suppose . But you wanted him to win , did n't you ? You really wanted him to win . " " You mean : is my son the vicar of my own ambition ? " Madeline shrugged . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impotent . " " That 's a bit private . " " It 's not true , anyway . I 'm sterile . " " That 's private too . And also untrue , I suppose . " " Why would I say it ? " " The love of grand agonies. "  | " Nothing grand about that piano , I 'll tell you . Anyway , you 're right . Nothing I 've said is true . I had a son . He died , years ago . " " How ? " She nodded at the ocean again . " Like that . Overboard a ship . For you and for everybody , that is just the sea . For me . . . " She stopped , then added , " At first I regularly threw flowers into it . Then I stopped coming . " She faced him . " This is the first time I 've come to the shore in years . " " I would n't have suggested if I 'd known . " " Do n't be silly . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here . " Brady kissed her . " Me , too , " he said . " It took you long enough . " He looked at his watch . " About fifteen minutes . " " About eight years . " " I was n't ready for a grand agony . " " Oh , Jesus ! " She set her face in a mocking pout with her lower lip pressing up against her nose . She had a perfect profile , and her distortion of it only drew attention to its perfection . Colman offered her a cigarette . She shook her head . He took one for himself . He retrieved his arm from the crook of her elbow and cupped a match . But the wind extinguished it . He tried another , then another . He placed the cigarette back in its pack . " What was your boy like ? " Colman asked . He was touching her sleeve , very gently . Madeline was moved . No one had ever asked her that . When she announced the fact of her son 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man asking her to share it with him . She felt the old emotion rising , as from its sleep inside her . " He was just a boy , Colman . Like any other . " She was afraid if she said how wonderful he was she would weep . " But let me ask you a question . What do you do ? " " I sell insurance . I used to be in politics , but I was at the wrong place at the wrong time . " " I know . I read about it . " Colman was not going to steer toward that . He attempted a shrug . " I had a great future . I decided to get out when I realized it was behind me . Madeline laughed . " How self-serving of you . " " Of course . Self-service  --  it 's the coming thing . " She laughed again , but with an eccentric quality that made too much of his crack . Colman 's cynicism was accustomed to its solitude . The thought that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said nothing . They were silent for a moment , then she said , " So where are we ? " " In the next parish over from Dunquin . Which is the westernmost village in Ireland , for your information . " " I guessed . " She raised her arms dramatically . " Ireland wrecks itself on our shores , these rocks . " He stood , facing her . " Let 's walk , Madeline . " " No . " She was staring at the ocean , seeing it for the grave it was . Without taking her eyes from it , she reached up to him , touching his sleeve . " Please , let 's stay a bit . " Brady felt that there was no more to say . Idly , he turned and skipped down several rocks and stood , shoulders hunched , hands in his pockets , pressing himself . The tide was going out . Already a line of pebbles lay exposed and , with each wash , they scurried back and forth . He listened to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of the wind and water . He heard a casual improvisation . Nothing false troubled the peace of the water at the land . Suddenly what had seemed ominous and grim was soothing . Perhaps five minutes passed while they remained apart , separate complacencies . Then Madeline stood and joined him . She slid her arm inside his " It 's good , is n't it ? " she said . He nodded . " I can feel its power in my feet . " " Its loveliness . " She rested against him , finding his shoulder with her head . He put his arm around her waist . They were silent and still again for some moments . " If you look long enough , " she asked , " can you see Ireland ? " " I can always see it , Madeline . I left the best of myself behind . " It was a thought he had never expressed before , and therefore never felt . She wanted to tell him that she understood that . The best of her was out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the country in its contours , his strong brow , his sharp chin , his lips ' thin sadness . She went up on her toes to kiss him . He turned and covered her with his arms and kissed her in return , a strong , determined kiss . When their mouths parted , Madeline stuffed her face into the hollow of Colman 's neck . She mumbled something , then raised herself and said , " Oh I did n't want all that talk . I did n't plan to talk to you at all . " " It 's seemed like mostly silence to me . " " That 's what I mean by talk . " She stuffed her face into his shoulderp275again . " But you have n't told me ! " she said . " The one thing I wanted to know . Your wife . What happened ? " " I could not begin to tell you , Madeline . " " You must ! " She struck his breast with her face . " You must ! " His silence said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " She pulled away to arm 's length and cracked her face at him . He took it for a smile . " That 's what makes you irresistible , " she said . " I do n't know . " " It is . It is . Do n't ever marry ! You 're irresistible . " She was reasserting a coy playfulness and he was relieved . " That 's why , " she went on , " I shall never divorce Thornton . Do n't you think I 'm ever so much more attractiveas someone 's wife ? " " I do n't know about that either . " " Oh , come now ! Adultery is so much more . . . "  --  she winked and rubbed her body against his  --  " . . . than mere fornication . " " Do n't be ribald about it . " " Oh , a streak of moralism ! " She turned away from him . He grabbed her shoulder and spun her back , more roughly than he intended . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But about the rest I can be . " " I do n't care about the rest . " " We 're not children . We know what we 're about . After seven years , eight , we can hardly be said to have been swept off our feet . " " Nevertheless , " he said icily , " I am not a frivolous man . There isnothing frivolous about my being here . " " Then I do n't understand it . Perhaps it 's a mistake . " " Perhaps . " They fell silent . " Are you leaving ? " she asked at last with her lily-like drooping delicacy . " No . " " Then shall we , as you suggested before , walk on ? " They did . As they hopscotched the rocks they talked in rising and fallingvoices . " Has it been seven or eight ? " he asked . " December six , nineteen thirty-three . " ' That 's quite a memory . " " It was the day of Repeal . " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court said Ulysses is not obscene . " " A lot they know . " " A lot you know . " They wandered along the broad shore 's back , the rocks like the knobs of its spine . It was turning into one of those days on which the sun , not hot , showed itself through clenched openings in the clouds . Winter was over . Madeline led the way up the ledge to a gaunt outcropping of earth . She climbed it and then faced back briefly to wave at Brady . He was having trouble making the climb . His shoes kept slipping on the stone . By the time he achieved the pinnacle she was gone . A path led into a thicket of brambles and the low scrub pine that thrives in the sandy soil by the ocean in New England . He followed it . The fog had entirely lifted and the last mist was burned away . There were little globules of moisture on the branches and small leaves of the undergrowth , but one could almost see them evaporating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have gone this way , he thought , and so continued along the path . It wound past a high chicken-wire fence that was nearly grown over . Brady stopped to examine it and discerned in the brambles and shrubs the ruins of a tennis court . " I used to play here . " He heard her voice before he saw her . She was standing inside the viny fence in the middle of the overgrown court . " The baseline would have been here . " She toed the dirt . " And the net . . . " She looked wistfully around . " Whose place is it ? " " Phillipses ' . The Sanford Phillipses . Friends of my parents . I 'd forgottentheir place was here . " " It seems ancient . " Like the ruins of Pompeii . But a tennis court can return to the wild in a matter of years . " It is ancient . That was years ago . I feel very old suddenly . " She made her way toward him , drew very close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality of playgrounds . . . , " Colman said absently . " Colman , I . . . need . . . some reassurance . " They stared at each other through the fence , not moving . Then , as if on cue , they began going along the opposite sides of the fence , gaining momentum as they went , slapping brush and branches out of the way . Soon they were practically running , side by side , the wire between them . They embraced in the gate.  |p277Madeline  was weeping . As Brady looked over her shoulder onto the old tennis court , he suddenlysaw the scene as it had been twenty-five years before . Young people , beautiful , tan , perfect in their whites , the two boys in flannel trousers , the two girls in pleats . They were playing a vigorous match . Madeline Gardner was serving . Thwapp ! Her racquet drove the ball deep into the service box , forcing the young man to skip backward and flick weakly at the ball , which arched back across the net . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful lunge , she smashed it back at him . He never had a chance . " Game ! " one hollered . " Set ! " " Great ! " Madeline approached the net . She kissed her opponent on the mouth . Her lips were wet . " Let 's go get loaded ! " Her partner threw his arm around her shoulders as they headed off the court , toweling themselves . Madeline let her right hand rest casually on his buttocks , her thumb hooked in his trousers pocket . Brady felt her hand on his own buttocks . She was pressing , kneading , exciting him immeasurably . " I know a place , " she said . Brady nodded and let her take him by the hand . They walked in silence along an overgrown path . " There , " Madeline Thomson said , pointing to a great stone mansion on a spit of land . The ocean crashed around it on two sides . " The Phillips house . Just for us . " The mansion struck no roots in the sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rock ledges that guarded against the breakers . A precarious place , Colman thought , all too exposed . " Perhaps there 's someone there , " he cautioned . " No . Not yet . " She set out across the high grass , still pulling him . It was the simplicityof her stride he envied ; she had no thought that she trespassed . He watched the windows on the second and third floors , expecting curtains to be parted , but there was no movement . The windows on the first floor were covered with cracked rectangles of wood the color of seaweed . The building itself was a compound of stones and beams . They entered a modest courtyard , formed on one side by a row of garages , on another by a detached cottage , and on the third by the house itself . Brady 's initial impression of the fragility of the place held despite its massive stateliness . Little mortar was discernible between the large , random-shaped rocks , and the mansion seemed to be an achievementmore of balance than construction.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding at the cottage , but otherwise ignoring it . She fixed her attention on the main entrance , which she approached confidently . She tried to open it . " Damn ! Locked ! " " Of course , it 's locked . " Should the proprietor have left the place open all winter for the sake of their early spring tryst ? " My parents never locked their house at Vineyard Haven . " " Times were different then , dearie . And Vineyard Haven is n't Gloucester . " Madeline slammed her fist against the door which , solid oak , barely registered the blow . " Oh , damn ! " She turned and slumped against the lintel and looked at Brady . She seemed a petulant , defied child , her mouth fixed in a showy pout . Brady leaned both his hands on the wood by her ears . " You give the appearance of being a very competent person . " She gave him a look of such unfettered trust that he felt a pang , as if he were misreading it or unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm not . " He kissed her , brushing her teeth with his tongue . " Let 's see what we can do , " he said . He took her hand and led the way back to the courtyard . He approached the servants ' cottage . Now the determinedself-assurance was in his stride , not hers . The cottage window was not boarded over . Brady cupped his free hand and peered in . There was a chaos of furniture which seemed to have been brought in from some porch , wicker chairs , a chaise longue upended with its green cushion showing stains . It looked like an attic . The door was locked , but flimsily so . It rattled when he shook it . Colmandropped Madeline 's hand and stepped back . He threw his shoulder against the door , bursting it open . Light sliced into the room like a butcher 's knife . The stale air , thick and wet , made Brady aware of the dried taste buds in his nostrils . He listenedfor the sounds of rats scurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust particles that slid into the room on the blade of sunlight . " It 's a bit damp , " he said . " I can smell my youth . " Madeline was standing next to him , pressing his arm . Brady ignored her pressure and stepped out of the light . He stumbled against a large basket , pushed it aside and began moving chairs from their pile . He cleared an aisle and crossed to a door . He opened it and stood still for a moment , waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark.  |p279He  was in his own cottage on the farm , listening to Nellie . " I thought you were dying . " " I am , darling . So are you . But another time . Not now . " Slowly what should have been Nellie 's face turned itself to him , a room blank and bitter around a single sagging bed . " We can not do this , Madeline , " he said . The sight of the miserable , dirty room unleashed an unexpected reluctance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy an itch of the flesh . He had a clear instinct that to go a step with her would be to go a long way . He was accustomed to going his distances alone . She blocked his way . " We must do it . I want you terribly . " She put her arms around him and kissed him , forcing her tongue into his mouth , pressing herself against him until she could feel his erection . He pulled away from her . " When I close my eyes I see this ending badly between us . " " Do n't close your eyes , " she ordered . What he saw when he closed his eyes was the fire in which Nell died . Ile had n't felt grief for her in years . Why was he feeling it now ? He wanted to tell Madeline , but the only way he could think of doing that was to ask about her grief . " How old was your son when he died ? " " Nine . I never close my eyes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did he say that ? She was looking at him sternly . " It is wrong , " he said , " our being here . " " Christ , " she said and turned away from him . " It would come to nothing , " he insisted . She shrugged , showing her weariness . " You , Madeline , are the one who said we are not children . That 's not your youth you smell . It 's bat shit . " " The bats have their business . I have mine . You 're vulgar . " Brady accepted her contempt and used it on himself . He had been avoiding this woman 's overtures for years , as if he were some schoolboy . Ile admitted it ; there was something in her that frightened him . Or something in himself that she drew out . He could hardly breathe . She was standing with her back to him . He was aware that her shoulders were moving , and he guessed she was weeping , which surprised lion . Perhaps she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosed inextricably a flow of her sadness too . He lifted his hand and touched her neck . The feel of her flesh stung him . He found the roots of her hair above the collar of her trench coat and traced them down behind Iwr ear and onto her shoulder . He pressed her shoulder and pulled her toward him.  |p280Madeline  turned slowly . The movement he had seen and assumed to be weeping had not been that . She was dry-eyed when she faced him and she looked at him without shyness . She had been opening her clothes , untyingthe belt of her trench coat and undoing its buttons and unfastening the ties of her dress , a blue satin chemise , which hung open , showing her completely from her throat down . With a graceful quick motion she shrugged her clothing off , all but her bra and white silk underpants . She stepped toward Colman , put one arm around him , and kissed his cheeks and his throat in a flurry . At the same time with her other hand she was reaching down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady thought he would ejaculate before he got his clothes off . He had never had a woman approach him so wantonly . She was rubbing his penis through his trousers even while undoing his fly , and then she had it out and was stroking it rapidly . He had to push her hand away to get his trousers off . She unsnapped her bra and offered him her breasts , which were large and taut . Her nipples were erect , and he bent to touch one with his tongue . Her flesh , to him , was like warm milk . He let his hand glide down her body and into her panties . She moaned more loudly than before and began to move her hips against him . He turned her toward the bed . He said , " This bed was made for one . " " Wonderful , " she said , lying down and taking him on top of her . She cupped his penis with both her hands and urged it into her . With a cry he began his motion . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then saved him for a time , despite himself , from the ache of his sterile worship . " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is Lowell Thomas . General Sir ArthurJamison , Commander of the British Expeditionary Force , announced today the withdrawal of the last units of his army from the city of Rouen , leaving behind a panicked population , a scattered and disorganized French force , and an apparently unimpeded Nazi armored wedge , which by this hour , presumably , has taken control . . " Turn it off , " Brady said . " I always listen to . . . " Madeline stopped to hear what Thomas was saying.  |p281'Jamison  denied that his army was in final retreat to the sea , but it seems clear to observers that the battle for France , ladies and gentlemen , is nearly over . Soon begins the battle for England . " " Please , Madeline . " " Colman , we must hear this . " " Alf M. Landon , former governor of Kansas and nineteen thirty-six GOP presidential candidate , replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " She turned the radio off and slid back up to the head of the large canopied bed and fitted her naked body against the back of Brady 's the way spoons slip together in their drawer . They were in her bedroom in the house at Pride 's Crossing . Their affair was less than two months old . It was the last week of May . Though Lowell Thomas 's evening news programmeant it was seven o'clock , the day was still bright outside and the light in the bedroom was gold and sharp , streaming in through a haze of lace curtains . " I should be going , " Colman said quietly . He was facing away from her , curled inside her form in a snugness of safety , as if he had crawled into a white cave . Retreat . He did not want to think about the fleeing British soldiers , but he did . " No . Stay . We never spend the night . " " I hate sneaking past your servants in the morning . " " They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them horribly . " " I doubt that . I 'm sure he 's perfectly fair . " " Perfectly . " " And if he returned to pluck me from the fire of your embrace , what then ? " " You know he 's in Washington . He ca n't leave now . " " Of course not . England would follow France before the tide but for Thornton Thomson 's finger in the Foggy Bottom dike . Which finger does he use ? " " It 's hardly funny , what 's happening . " " Oh ? Do I seem amused ? " " You seem indifferent . " " I am . " " I do n't like that in you . " Brady stiffened and she felt it . He did not reply to her . He clutched inwardly as though a bone had broken in the body they made together . He was always on the alert for signs of her condescension . Finally he ventureda hand back beyond his own hip to hers , to stroke the ingenious curve without seeing it.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sure we are . I just ca n't stand you . " She found the blatant irony of his statement endearing . " May one ask why ? " Brady did not reply . The opposite was the case , and that was as obvious to her as it was to him . Since he had been seeing her , his life had changed . It was as if everything that had gone before had been a preparation for Madeline Thomson . Her presence cheered him . When he was not with her he could close his eyes and clearly see a woman 's face again . Hers . But still , that fear that had clutched at him in the servants ' cottage their first day in Gloucester had not evaporated . Brady was a man who learned his lessons . The future would be like the past . All that had gone before , weighed in the scales of his pain , seemed to Brady a preparation for worse pain yet . He did not want it . He did not want her . " Madeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I should go . " She studied him in the half-light , feeling the power of his sadness . She had the sense that she made him continually unhappy . He was touching the sharp edge of his upper teeth to his lip ; she watched the red flesh there carefully , expecting blood . Somewhere among the dark aisles of their feelings for each other they kept getting lost . " Colman , may I say something ? " Her voice was just above a whisper . He did not move . His body was dark against the window . His body was her dark source , immobile , huge . He seemed to her the strongest man she had ever known . That she could sense his fear and his weakness only made her think him the stronger . No other man had ever shown her enough of himself that she could think of him as someone like her , as someone who might not hurt her even if she , for once , made it possible for him to do so . She watched his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched his fingers not twitching . There was only the soft rising and falling of his form , which was bent over two folds of flesh at his stomach . " Colman , I love you . " She waited for him to acknowledge what she had said . She 'd been wanting to say it to him for weeks . She knew what a feeble expression it was , and how dangerous . They were the words that had jinxed her marriageand every subsequent affair . Brady bent his face down to his fingers . Her words hung in the halfdarknessbetween them . He was trying to assess his reaction . It occurred to him that she was deliberately introducing the one aspect their relationshipcould not sustain , trying to destroy it . But that was farfetched and he knew it . His trouble with her words was that they 'd come so easilyp283to her , as if she said them to every man who scratched her surface . He saw suddenly how she differed from him . For her the profession of love was a means toward it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been established . He had not said those words to any woman since Nellie . He was not going to say them now . He felt cornered and unsure . He cursed himself for his silence and for the hopelessness it displayed . He never expected to use those words again . Madeline felt her anger welling up . He was not going to acknowledge what she 'd said . He was not going to reply . He was going , sensible bastardthat he was , to gather up his clothes , dress , and go straight the hell away . Who cares ? She rolled away from him to her own edge of the bed . Still he did not move or look at her . She reached across the two-foot gap to the lowboy t hat held a lamp and a crystal decanter half-empty of Scotch whisky and two tumblers . With one hand she covered her breasts , hating the way they hung udder-like when she arched forward , and with the other she poured a drink . The noise of glass on glass betrayed her trembling . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with alcoholic tendenciesstaccato the bottle off the glass while pouring . One thing for certain , she was not an alcoholic . Colman turned to face her . " A thousand years ago , " he said , " when I was a lonely kiddo living in a tiny space with a huge crowd , I 'd go to the top of a hill and lie down if it was summer and now summer 's all I remember . And I would lie there with the clover under me , a million leaves of clover , and the stars over me too many to count , and I would say to God , why is it with all this clover and with all these stars and the abundance of the earth , I have no ma ? " Madeline gulped her whisky . " Do you know what God said to me ? " She shook her head . " He said , ' No reason . ' " Brady paused . " ' No reason . ' " " That 's the only answer there is , Colman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the best answer . ' No reason . ' " " When did your mother die ? " " One night when the supper dishes were done , but before the sun had gone all the way down . I was very young . " " Were you nine ? " No . Why ? " " No reason . " Madeline tried to imagine him a boy , dying . She could not . She looked at him hard . He was telling her how alone he felt . She was thinking that if only she had died , like Colman 's mother , then her son would have grown up to be like him . He was as alone as she was andp284it was not killing him . Why was it killing her ? " Why wo n't you say you love me ? " " Why would you feel better if I did ? " Because , she thought , then you would be like all those others and I could stop worrying that this was different . She carried in her mind , like snapshots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men and they 'd wiggled their feeble echoes back at her . " I love you too , darling , " they 'd say so easily , and then everything would be safe again because she had said it first . She could get her men to do anything , and she could leave them when she chose . But Colman would not say it , and that was terrifyingto her . She had to defend herself , not from him , from her fear . " Do you think , " she asked seriously , " that you are capable of love ? " Brady did not hesitate . " I love my son . " " Why ? Because you can boast about him ? That is n't love . It 's blood cells . " That stung Brady , not that it was true , but that it was not precisely false . " It 's like your kind , Madeline , to equate the object of loving with the object of boasting . The two activities have nothing to do with each other . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? I resent you . " She poured more Scotch into her glass . " You 've a quake in your hand , " he said . " And you 've a sneer in your eye . " " No , I do n't . Anyway , if I did you could n't see it . " The room was much darker , and the canopy of the four-poster reduced Madeline and Colman to shadowy forms . " Do you want a drink ? " she asked . " No . " " Bastard . " " Why ' bastard ' ? " " For what you 're thinking . " " What am I thinking ? " " That I 'm a drunk . " " Well , you are . " " I guess I am . " She reached over to the lowboy to put her glass down . " Anyway , I have to go to the bathroom . " She slid out of bed , taking a blanket with her , covering herself . Brady was always struck by her shyness outside of bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , display it , sell it to him for his glances . But standing , walking around the room , her nakedness mortified her . Though to Brady the sight of her at a distance , leaning over to pick up a dress or sliding a garter up her leg , was exceedingly pleasurable . Hisp285mistake was in thinking that her body was as new to her as it was to him . She thought the body of a woman her age had to be embarrassing . He could hear her noises from the bathroom . He got out of bed and crossed to the chair onto which he had folded his clothes . He put on his trousers , socks , and shoes . When he straightened from tying the laces she was looking at him from the bathroom doorway . She had the flannel blanket firmly secured in towel-fashion above her bosom . She said nothing . Brady put his shirt on and buttoned it . He wanted to get away from her . He found his usual counterfeit impossible . He had no confidence in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him she loved him and he  --  this was what he was feeling  --  did not believe her . Instinctively he knew the use she habitually put such sentiments to . She was laying traps for him . But he had made his first reputation in laying them for others . " A connoisseur of ambush , " Michael Collins had called him once . Brady had the thought that he was afraid of this woman as he once had been of Purcival . A strange thought ; he put it away . He stood with his tie stretched around his neck , an end in either hand , but frozen , watching her . Madeline crossed to the closet and withdrew a red velour robe and , lettingthe blanket fall , put it on while showing Brady only her back . When she turned around she had knotted the belt at the waist . His eyes went instantlyto the sculpted space between her breasts , which he never noticed unless she was clothed . She went to the radio and snapped it on , then got her glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He twirled the necktie around itself and tied his knot . The static cracked out of the speaker and there was music . Brady put his suit coat on and stood there , wishing she would look at him . He was feeling suddenly quite devastated because it seemed there was nothing for him to say or do but leave , and if he left then , like that , the end had come upon them unjustly . It was too soon and there was no reason for it to happen like that . No reason . By God , Brady thought , for once that 's not enough ! When this ends , there will be a reason ! A Damn good reason ! " Will you say goodnight ? " he asked softly . She turned on the bed and was about to speak when the music on the radio was interrupted and a solemnly detached announcer said , " Ladies and gentlemen , this bulletin from the front in Europe : Belgium has **26;4795;TOOLONG to Germany , and the War Office in London has issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own seaworthy craft to assist in the desperate , heroic evacuation of the entire British Expeditionary Force from the beaches of a small French village known as Dunkerque . " The announcer said details would follow , and then the music resumed.  |p286Colman  was staring at Madeline . She drained her glass . " Poor bastards , " he said . It was his first act of sympathy for British soldiers in years . " Yes , " Madeline said , " are n't we ? " Brady left . He thought about her for days , how she 'd slipped away from him into her dark mood , how she 'd retreated into what she was drinking , how she brought him face to face with his own pain . Perhaps he should not call her again , he thought . It would come surely to disaster . But still her image filled his mind when he should have been thinking of other things . She attracted him powerfully . On the first Saturday in June he was at home at Prescott Street working in his room , going over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make with the most recent large sum Anselmo had sent him . He had to plan such transactions carefully to disguise the source of the money and the amount of it . He did the work at his house , where he could be certain of his privacy and freedom from interruption . But he was interrupted that day nevertheless . Maeve came to his door and knocked timidly . She knew better than to disturb him . " What is it ? " he asked from his chair . " You 've a visitor , Colman . I told her you were busy . " Colman knew immediately that it was she . He got up , went to the door and opened it . " A visitor ? " Maeve stared at him . She let her question show . " Yes . Mrs. Thomson , the lady from fight-night . " What was her brother doing receiving visits from a married woman ? " Thanks , dearie , " Colman said , slipping by her . It did not occur to him to go to his mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur to him to offer his sister an explanation , though her demeanor made it clear she wanted one . He took the stairs two at a time , boyishly . Madeline 's here , he thought . Nothing else registered . He found her in the living room . She was standing in the bay window and , dressed in white slacks and surrounded by sunlight , she was more beautiful than he had ever seen her . He walked directly to her and , without speaking , took her in his arms and kissed her . All of his reluctance , his worry , his nervousness about her evaporated . He wanted her . He wanted her in every way he could have her . She responded with a like passion , playing his kiss , prolonging it , holding him at the neck with her arms fast , as if she had let him go for the last time . How strange it was for both of them . When they parted they looked at each other until Madeline 's eyesp287flicked toward the living room entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him holding Madeline . As far as his sister and their kids were concerned , Colman was a bull spinster , a celibate , a man without women . " Perhaps I should n't have come , " Madeline said , but she was teasing him for his embarrassment . Colman looked toward the door , only to see a flash of blue as Maeve hurried away . He turned back to Madeline and tried to stifle the awkwardnesshe felt . " I 'm glad you came . I 've thought of nothing but you since I left . " " Oh , good , " she smiled . " Then you have a lot to say . " " Practically nothing . I 'm over my head . I admit it . " Madeline was moved by that . She lowered her face , but he , taking her chin in the crook of his forefinger , raised it again . " I look terrible , " she said . " Do n't look at me so closely . " " You look wonderful . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binge . That 's not mascara under my eyes . " Colman wondered why she said things like that to him . Did she want him to think of her that way ? He would n't . " How would you like some tea ? " he asked . " I 'd rather a drink . " " Tea , darling . We 'll have a drink later . " Colman led Madeline to the kitchen . Maeve was fiddling with towels at their rack . " Maeve , " he said , " you remember Mrs. Thomson , do n't you ? " Colman gestured . Neither woman spoke . Colman got the drift of Maeve 's disapproval immediately . Her face was a mask of it . Madeline Thomson was a married woman . If the laws of God meant so little , why had Maeve slept alone all these years ? There was nothing subtle about her resentment . Brady , to his own surprise , understood and did not react to her rudeness angrily . This was not the time or place for tea . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maeve nodded but would n't look at them . Colman caught Madeline 's eyes , their apology . She felt she should n't have come . He took her hand and , stopping at the closet for his jacket , led her out of the house . They took Madeline 's car , a sporty yellow convertible , a new one . Colmandrove . " Sorry , " he said . " The Irish have no manners . " He said it whimsically , but Maeve 's response had depressed him . Madeline laughed . " Do n't complain . My people have nothing but . " Colman looked at her . The wind was stirring her hair and she wasp288smiling at him . The hell with Maeve . He felt quite wonderful to be with Madeline again . He slid the car into the traffic on Commonwealth Avenue , heading downtown . " What shall we do ? " he asked . " Do you know the way to Marblehead ? I want to take you for a sail . " Ordinarily that would have been the last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeline 's invitation was extraordinary . Since the death of her son she had not walked by the sea , except with him . Now she was ready to sail upon it . Good for her ! Colman was struck by her cockiness , though he knew it for the study it was , and , after the embarrassment of Maeve 's showering disapproval , he wanted to indulgeit . He followed Madeline 's directions to Marblehead and an hour later they were standing at the yacht club slip waiting for the launch to take them out to the Thomson mooring . " I do n't know much about boats , " Colman said . " That 's OK . " Madeline slid her arm around his waist . " You 'll learn about the boat while it learns about you . I 'm an expert . Or , at least , I used to be . " " Whatever you say , Captain . Just give the orders . " The gray launch pulled up , driven by a college kid . " She 's all rigged , Mrs. Thomson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks , Tommy , " Madeline said , hopping aboard . Colman followed her , feeling awkward in his bare feet and rolled trousers . He never had the right damn clothes with this woman . The launch slid slowly through the harbor , threading by hundreds of sailing boats . The breeze was light . Apparentlymost skippers had decided not to bother . The motor boat drew up to a sleek , narrow-hulled thirty-two-footer . Colman was satisfied to see that it was a larger boat than some of the fragile-looking ones they 'd passed . There was a cabin under the mast . But then he wondered if the boat was too big for Madeline to handle alone . He felt an apprehension that embarrassedhim and that he stifled . The wind was so gentle . What could happen ? The boy pulled the launch alongside from astern . The words Desperate Lark were stenciled in script on the stern . The boat had gleaming brass fittings and white trim around weathered teak . It was a beautiful thing . The mainsail draped elegantly from the boom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines were coiled . The shine and order of it all were reassuring to Brady . The way the lad handled the launch was , too . Madeline did not wait for anyone 's hand . She hopped aboard the boat even before the kid had stopped his slide along it . Colman followed her , awkwardly . " We may need a tow , dear , " she said to the boy.  | " I 'll keep an eye out , Mrs. Thomson . But you better watch things , too . They say there 's a storm later . I would stay in the inner harbor . " " What , with this wind ? We 'll be lucky to make the breakwater . " She waved and then suddenly , effortlessly , the launch glided away , the boy waving back . Madeline took her place at the tiller . Colman did what she told him to do . He pulled up the big sail , then the small one . Then he untangled the yarn that dangled from the left guy-wire . He fastened the line that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went forward and cast off . Throughout these procedures Madeline was calmly pointing and instructingand using but translating a language in which familiar words were used strangely : main , sheet , cleat , port , tell-tale , stay . Other words  --  jib , lull , starboard , halyard , gunnel  --  were altogether unfamiliar to him . Brady had never been in a sailboat before , but he performed his functions smoothly and efficiently . Madeline , for her part , steered them clear of the yacht club moorings , he thought , superbly . Though the wind remained very light , the boat moved at a handsome clip , which amazed Colman . He decided he was going to like it . Once out in open water , Madeline fastened the mainsheet to the jam cleat at her feet . " Ordinarily , " she said , " we do n't do this . We should keep the line free at all times to let the sail out fast in case we have to . But , what the hell ? " She smiled at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take my clothes off . Here , take over . " Colman took the tiller from her and began to stare at the compass as she instructed , trying to helm the arrow at a constant 2100 . Madeline shoved the cabin hatch back , opened the low doors , then stooped down into the cramped dark space . She stood in the shadow with her back slightly to Colman and began to unbutton her shirt . He watched her undress . But for her tennis shoes , she took everything off . The sight of her nude back loosed his desire and he savored it . He wanted to see her from the front . " You 're too modest , " he said . Was she really ? No one else could see her . The nearest boats were a quarter of a mile away . He knew it was n't shyness or prudery . It was her foolish fear of an aging body . " You 're too beautiful , " he added . She smiled at him over her shoulder and then slipped a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of terry cloth and covered her to just above her knees . She turned toward him then and said , " Now I 'm modest . " But he was thinking about her lack of underwear . He imagined her breasts , the patch of hair at her vagina . " You 're luffing , " she cried , pointing at the sail , which was flapping away suddenly . He had lost the angle and was steering at 240  --  . " Pull itp290in toward you and get it back to two hundred ten degrees , " she ordered . He did and the sails filled again . " Do you want to change ? " she asked . " There are shorts down there that should fit you , and some shoes . " She took the tiller . " Good idea , " he said . He was anxious to get out of his wool pants and linen shirt . " I 'll put on the shorts . " " Put on the shoes too , sweetie . If the deck got wet you 'd slip all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the deck would get wet . The breeze was light and the boat was riding at an even keel . But that new authority was still in her voice . He put on the shoes as well as the shorts . Both were a bit small on him , and he was glad for the evidence that he was bigger than her husband . They sailed on for an hour , tacking irregularly . Madeline explained the principle of the air foil that made it possible to sail upwind , and she instructedhim in the basic procedures of the sport . Colman thought it all fairly obvious , but he admired her expertise and took a surprising delight at being out of his own element and utterly in hers . About midafternoon the sea turned flat as the wind died completely . The Desperate Lark stopped moving . Its wake disappeared . The sails bounced futilely in the broad even rollers that the waves became . " What now ? " Colman asked . " Now a drink . " Madeline left the tiller  --  it was impotent anyway  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was carrying a fifth of Cutty Sark and two glasses . She poured them each some . They cheered each other , clinked glasses , and sipped . Madeline stared at him in a way that made him uncomfortable . He turned and stared at the shore . " How far would you say ? About two miles ? How will we ever get in ? " Colman allowed a faint concern to show itself in his voice . The kid had said not too far , perhaps a storm . Why would Madeline disregard such a warning ? " The wind takes care of its own , sweetheart . " " Will the boat come for us ? " " No . We 're too far out . But he 'll alert the Coast Guard if we are n't back by dusk . " Madeline smiled and drank . Colman tried to take confidencefrom her but could n't . He was irritated suddenly by her cavalier manner . She was being irresponsible , he was sure . He did not like being in a boat so far from land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind will come up , " she said . " This is just the midafternoon lull . It often happens this time of year . Especially if there 's weather coming . " Madeline stared into the water just off the boat and did not speak again . She seemed calm , if preoccupied . He put aside his worry . It was ir/rational , he decided , born of his problem , not hers . He watched her . He guessed she was thinking of her son . He secured his drink between cushionsand crossed to her carefully , and sat with his hand on her thigh . " You know the sea so well , " he said . She nodded . The sea was her old friend and her old enemy . " I 'm glad you asked me to do this with you , darling , " he said . " Maybe you can master it now , your awful grief . " Madeline stared at him unfathomably . It seemed that her eyes made terrible confessions : my legs are made of straw ! My breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of plaster ! " Come here , " he whispered , and she turned to him . " Come here , " he said again , and she put her drink down between the gunnel and a jib winch and went into his arms . They kissed passionately . Her way of puttingher tongue into his mouth excited him immeasurably . He held her away enough to lift the terry smock over her head . She undid his shorts while he knocked cushions from the benches onto the floorboards . She went down under him , urging his body onto her , but in such a way that she could take his penis into her mouth . He felt what seemed the most acute pleasure of his life . It was the combination of the softly rocking sea and the benign sun and the rhythmic flapping of the sails overhead and the exquisite pressure of her mouth  --  all excruciating and new . He did not want to come in her that way . When he felt the tension peaking he pulled away and down and entered her vagina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , repeating his name , demanding that he pour himself into her as if she were the ocean . He realized that she was weeping . She wept throughout their lovemaking , wailing so grotesquely at one point that Brady was unaccountably filled with the urge to tear her clothes off and force himself on her . But of course she was already naked and they were already coupled . It was his strange fantasy at their violent climax . She did not stop weeping . When he cupped her face with his hand to make her look at him , her eyes were accusing and bitter . What are you doing ? they seemed to ask . Leave me alone ! Ca n't you see I 'm dying ? She rolled from under him , crushingherself against the bench . She wept on , crazily . What was the weight under which Brady found himself flattened then , if not of her self-loathing ? He reminded himself that she could not have , as yet , drunk too much . He touched the curve of her shoulder , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . He wanted her to turn toward him with it , to let him receive her tears . All his life had been a preparation for that . He was not afraid of ' her pain . Ile had his own . He wasp292ready to carry someone else 's who would carry his . Her son was dead . Her marriage was meaningless . Her family , her name , her position were as nothing to her . Such misery was not possible to the solitary because , alone , it would kill them . Brady knew about that . If he enabled her to pour it out and be rid of it , he would gladly lie with her even as she rolled away from him . He was not going to flee just because her loneliness faced him with his own . He was not going to submit to the panic that rolled through him when he acknowledged the idea that this woman not only disliked herself and drank too much but seemed at times to be mad . " Darling , stop it . " " Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had to make this man like the others . " Tell me you love me . " He said nothing . She crushed her hands against her face . He raised himself to look over her shoulder . She was gnawing the knucklebone of her forefinger . It was bleeding . A trickle of blood ran down her hand to the floor of the cockpit . Colman covered the hand with his , pulling it from her mouth . But she struck like a viper , snaring his thumb in her teeth and biting to the bone , an iron clamp . The pain was excruciating . " Do n't ! " He yelled despite himself . But she would not release him . He could not stand the pain . He felt her teeth wedging into the joint , grinding at the marrow . " My God ! " he screamed . " Aiiiii ! " She was mad . She was biting his thumb in two ; he could feel it splitting . He drew his legs up to take his weight off his left arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clenching his fist , smashed down on the side of her face . Her jaw popped open with the blow , and Brady clutched his thumb to his chest . " Jesus Christ , woman ! " Madeline threw her arms around his neck and pulled herself up . " Darling , darling , I 'm sorry , " she said ; " I 'm sorry . " He suffered her embrace . What the hell did she expect from him now ? The woman had a viciousness he had not suspected . " I am sorry . " She released his neck . She had stopped weeping . Brady nursed his thumb . Madeline refused to look at it . " I . . . " She wanted the exact word . " became . . . emotional . " Brady ignored her . " I did n't intend to do that . " She paused , adjusted her weight over her legs . " Are you going to answer me ? "  | " Sorry , " he replied , " I did n't know I was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is n't the main question . Will I lose my thumb ? " He smiled at her , a thin , restrained smile . " Do n't be merciless . Your thumb will be all right . " " Have you ever managed to chew one through entirely ? " " No . " " Well , you 're not merciless , are you ? Cheers . " He put his thumb to his lips as if it were a drink . " Yes . Cheers . " She reached past him to the gunnel for her Scotch . She drank , then covered her lap with the striped shift and crossed her arms over her breasts . She was sheepish and silent . " Madeline , once you mentioned your analyst to me , but you never explained . " " That I 'm loony ? " She sipped her drink , less compulsively than before , as if the hysteria had left her chastened , exorcised . " Are you ? " Brady asked the question calmly , without accusation , withoutpunishment . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen Riggs 's . You may have heard of him . " " No . " " He 's a swell fellow , a famous sailor . He owns the fastest sloop in New Bedford . " " How charming , the qualifications you cite . " " I was there twice . Once because my son died , and once because I did n't . " " I 'm sorry , darling . " Brady tried not to show her that he was shocked by her admission . " Oh , Colman , you must n't think of me in that way , as pathetic and loony and . . . '  --  she drained her glass , then studied it before saying , " a drunk . " Brady said nothing . " Are you going to answer me ? " " What am I being asked ? " " How do you think of me ? " " You do drink too much , you know . " " I know . And I 'm an adulteress , and I give my lover rabies , and I cannotconvince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't have to convince me of anything . " Oh , why would n't he say it , she thought ? It would be so much easier if he 'd say those words , because then she 'd know they were not true . Instead he kissed her . I lc was trying to quell the uneasiness she stirredp294in him . This woman , mad , was more alive , he felt , and more sane than he was . He was surprised to feel his penis asserting itself . It was too soon , was n't it ? She made him feel so young . He moved to kiss her again ; he would channel his longing and his fear into this kiss . But she pulled away from him , urgently away from him . She pivoted on her knees . She had felt an ominous chill sweep over the sea , and was turning to check the horizon . " Good Christ ! " she said . There was a black thread across the western sky . A tutored eye could not miss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water was still calm enough where they were , and the wind , though just picking up , was still off it . But Madelineknew what was heading in on them . She stood , slid the dress over her head and on , and went to the tiller . Brady sensed her mood and copied it . He put on the shorts and tied his shoelaces . " It 's going to blow , darling , " Madeline said . " Are you game ? We try for the shore on the first wind ? " " What 's the alternative ? " Brady was staring at the growing black edge . He 'd never seen anything like it . The water was kicking up , and he could see the wind dusting the sea and moving toward them fast . " We could drop sail and ride it . But we do n't know how long it 'll last . It could carry us out . " Those words frightened Brady . He realized how unfamiliar the sea was to him . He did not want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in then , " he said . " Right . When the wind hits , " Madeline said , " it 'll knock us , so hang on . I want you to keep the jib as flat as you can . If it blows too hard , I 'll drop the main . Do you remember which halyard ? Port , OK ? Left , OK ? Watch the boom and give us a kiss , love . " When Colman leaned to her she pressed his penis through the shorts . He was enormous . " Jesus , " she said , and gave him a great smile . And then it hit , and it did knock them . The boat went a third of the way over and Brady thought they were capsizing . But Madeline let out the line on the main and it slammed open , bringing the boat back to even keel . The wind came from offshore directly behind them and the mainsail was out at a sharp right angle to the boat . The jib swirled chaotically behind it , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she ordered as the boat came about . Brady pulled on the sheet , but there were tangles and he could n't move the sail . The boat was flying . " Goddamnit , get it over ! " she cried . But Brady could n't . The wind kept ripping at the jib and Madeline was having trouble holding course . Brady saw that the lines were snaggedp295on a brass hook on the front of the mast . He crossed to undo the tangle , when a wholly new puff much more powerful than the first , hit the boat . The mainsail was hurled back into the boat with a clap like an explosion , which was Brady 's warning . He ducked just as the boom crashed over him , missing his head by inches . It would have killed him . The boat went over again , and this time the end of the boom almost went into the water . Brady hurled himself up to the starboard gunnel and desperately grabbed the ledge of wood . Madeline was hauling in the mainsheet , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedged herself on the lip of the stern and pressed with her left foot against the port deck . Her right foot was curled around the tiller so that both her hands could work the line . She had to get the main in . She let off a bit , and that brought the boat up . Colman saw what she was trying to do , and he joined her to haul in the main . " Try that jib again ! " she hollered . Rain was pelting them and she was n't sure her voice had carried , but he moved forward . Since she was beating upwind , the jib line freed itself with the flapping , and he was able to bring the sheet in and around the cleat . He wrapped it around his hands and leaned away as she 'd told him to do . It had been so much easier coming out . It had seemed so much safer . Madeline was eyeing the shore , picking her spot . She could not continue on the starboard tack , though the boat rode well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore and never in . She had to come about onto a port tack . She picked her spot on the land and made for it , pulling the tiller in and hollering " Hold on ! " The boat heeled and the ocean began to wash the deck . This time it went nearly halfway over , and Colman felt the cold water rushing over his feet . He looked up at Madeline , but she was staring at the shore , and the set of her face was so stony that it frightened him further . There was something unfamiliar and eerie in her that manifested itself then . Was it that she was going to die ? The thought grabbed him just as a huge wave crashed over the boat , startling him . He was terrified . He fixed his eyes upon her . This was madness . Was she committing suicide ? The boat was going down , he was sure . The sail , close-hauled , was making its thunder , the gale snapped along its battenedge . How could she hold it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hers , looking for blood . " Drop it ! " he screamed . " Drop it ! Let 's ride it out ! " But she ignored him . She was mad . She was going to succeed this time and she would kill him with her . " Madeline , drop it ! Damn it to hell , drop it ! " It was as if he was not there . She was in the boat alone . All of her energy went into three fierce efforts : her eye upon its point on shore ; herp296fists holding taut the main ; her right leg keeping the tiller steady . Madelinewas not afraid . She was riding the craft on the far edge of its limit . They had to make shore . Ten minutes , with that wind , and they would . Then hell was really going to break . She could feel it . But could she hold for ten minutes ? Brady was furious and terrified . Why would n't she look at him ? He thought of releasing his line and letting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do . It could make things worse . He stared at her , trying to read her . Was it madness ? Was there a glee in her flirtation with this disaster ? Was she going to take them down ? The water was splashing into the cockpit , waves of it . Brady was sure that in seconds he would be up to his neck . He wanted to reach for a cushion , something that would float , but the effort to hold the line and remain wedged against the side of the boat had him paralyzed . He looked away from Madeline and toward the front of the boat in time to take a wave full in the face . When the water cleared , he was shocked to see , dead ahead and very close , land ; land ! Not two hundred yards away , and not just land , but the point of the harbor behind which they would be safe . He turned to look at Madeline , to see her again . Had he misread her ? Was that madness ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had willed them in . She had sailed them along the thin edge , exactly to do what she did then . She began letting off the main as the boat flashed by the light , and immediatelythe sea eased . Without being told , Brady whipped across the cockpit and began letting off the jib . When he looked at Madeline , there was nothing of the woman who had wept crazily or who had bitten him insanely or who drank too much or who teased him with her glib intimacy . Brady thought , strangely , inappropriately , how impossible it was to speak to God . He 'd thought he was going to drown , but he had uttered no prayers , no sorrows . He had not sought pardon . Kneeling down or dying , there were no words . Now , before this woman who was grave and rigid as any saint in glass , he felt something he 'd never felt before . He felt balked and immobile . He was unable to speak to her . Sitting there , aching at his ropes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in its dark hole and recognized it . His for her.  | EVEN IF ONE NURTURED the illusion that things were as they had been in the world , in the nation , in one 's own life , one could not sustain it past the moment of crossing the threshold of a massive urban railway station . It was in the railway stations of the United States that the war was most visible to Americans  --  every third man was in uniform  --  and most felt : he was saying goodbye to someone . It was July of 1942 , a Friday afternoon . The noises in South Station in Boston filled the vast pseudo-Roman cavern the way confetti fills the air over a parade of heroes . Travelers and welcomers rushed out of their compartmentsand porticoes at each other , weeping , laughing , squealing like bats released from caves . One woman with a sagging midriff and thick thighs was precariously standing on a girdled suitcase trying to see a train just sliding into its stall . A little boy , his eyes bone-white and dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed intent on eating each other . The boy 's eyes did not turn or close . People jumped from trains before they stopped moving ; their relatives caught them . Engineers looked down from their perches , not bored , not wondering what the shrieking was about . A fat man wearing a butcher 's apron ran in from the street . No one seemed to think him strange . Young boys in brown uniformswore their dreams of wounds like ribbons , stood holding their inert duffle bags as if they were corpses , and kept repeating the same gesture to their mothers and fathers and girlfriends ; raising their wrists to see what time it was . Later they would rest their cheeks against the glass of train windows , wanting nothing but a kind word from the sergeant . Colman Brady , looking trim and well tailored in a tan cord suit , stood beneath the arch of the entrance foyer that led into the station from SummerStreet . He had wheeled his way deftly from the curb where he 'd left the taxi , through the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that he would miss his train . But now he was stopped , standing still , taking in the scene as if he were n't part of it . It was the sight of all the soldiers that struck him . The soldiers , invariably , were tall and had short brown hair and had great smiles even while saying farewell tothe lovelies who clutched at their own hurt more than at their men . The soldiers , invariably , all looked to Colman Brady like Collins.  | " Do n't you talk to me in that tone of voice ! " Brady could still hear himself saying it . It had been months before , winter . Pearl Harbor 's aftershockstill rumbled beneath everything . " I 'm only explaining , Dad , " the kid said with patronizing calm , " that I do n't share your prejudices . " " My prejudices are irrelevant . They have nothing to do with your quitting school . " They had the argument on the esplanade of the Charles . The wind whipped up the river from the basin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket , and his lips turned blue with cold . But Colman had no sympathy for him . Such carelessness was typical . The kid led with his chin habitually . " It 's a leave of absence . It 's not quitting . All kinds of fellows are joiningup . " " Not seniors , I 'd venture . Not now . For God 's sake , Micko , you 'll graduate in five months . " " But they 're offering commissions to seniors now . I 'd go in as an of-ficer . " " You will in any case . " " But , Dad , the war 's on now . They need us now . " " The war 's been on for years . It 'll wait . " " You 're indifferent because it 's England . " " As I said , that has nothing to do with it . I 'm thinking of you . " " No , you 're not . " Micko was responding to an instinct he had never felt before , yet trusted absolutely , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instinct of his own , slapped his son across the face . He instantly realized that he was badly overreacting . It was the first blow he 'd struck against the boy in years . Where was the infuriating truth in what the kid had said ? His son 's graduation from Harvard Collegewas far from a matter of indifference to Brady . It mattered more to him then  --  he would never admit this  --  than the war did . Collins took the blow . He showed his father a stoic face which promisednever to forget . For once anger outweighed the hunger for approval . Collins Brady had garnered honor and respect from his friends and teachers . He had achieved a habit of such excellence that he took the deferenceof others for granted . It was inevitable that at some point he should require deference from his father . " You will never do that to me again , " he said evenly . The son was putting his father on notice ; not a grand defiance , a simple announcement . From it , two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own freedom and his father 's admiration.  | " You will never do that to me again , " he had said . Colman drew back his hand . It still stung from the first blow . He held it poised at his shoulder long enough for Collins to think , Good God ! Colman swung his open hand more grandly this time and , in landing the second blow , made Collins gag for breath , turning him from a strappingyoung man who 'd won his prizes into a victim under the kitchen table who only waits for lickings . The boy would not so easily defy him again . Collins completed the year at Harvard , but , owing to the national emergency , the traditional commencement was canceled , and his father felt a petty disappointment . The pomp , the undulating robes , the dignitariesuncelebrated , the passing of his son into something not his , the sight of him  --  magna cum laude  --  in their midst : he had wanted it more than he was ready to admit . Ironically , Colman Brady had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caring nothing for commencement and intensely for his country , his son was . Exactly a week after the term ended he went off to basic training and then OCS in Virginia , hoping for an assignment with the Seventh Army , which was commanded by a proper New Englander who , though a West Pointer , had through his family and his years at Groton numerous ties to Harvard . His name was George Patton . Phelps Otis was already one of the junior officers on his staff . Collins , whose instinct for status had not failed him yet , hoped to be another . Indeed , the only sense of failure Collins Brady carried with him when he left at last for the army was that of having cruelly disappointed his father by becoming what he wanted him to be . Colman , standing under the arch of the entranceway , watched the soldiersbustle in and out of the station . He had forgotten momentarily that there was a train to catch . He was looking at a tall draftee on whom the summer khaki was draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully , even on his first day . The draftee was saying goodbye to his parents , both of whom were weeping . Brady wondered what the father would say to his son . He took a step toward them to eavesdrop , but their intimacy was mute , a matter of stifled groans and sobs . The boy had a terrifiedlook in his eye , like a snagged beetle in a web . He had a baldysour and pimples and was losing the snot of his weeping off his chin and onto his uniform 's ribbonless breast , its first decoration . The sight of the boy transfixed Brady momentarily . But the announcer called a train , and that brought him back . He was late . Brady pressed his way through the station , banging his small leatherp300bag against other people 's knees and apologizing . He made his train , just barely . He read an abandoned front page , the Hartford Courant . The news was all war and bake sales . Hitler could use his U-boats against New York . What would America do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeple . North of Boston a series of artilleryoutposts were being constructed ; Brady read that item with interest , but it told him nothing he did n't know . One of the companies he had acquired had the contract to provide the cement . He looked out the window . The train was passing slowly by the rear end of the Back Bay . A quick monotony of scene and sound asserted itself ; dreary old row houses , the hard clack of iron on iron . Colman 's mind returned to the great hall of South Station from which Collins too had taken his farewell nearly two months before . Maeve , Maureen , Deirdre , and Jack had all come to South Station and , for nearly an hour , they 'd swayed around Collins in uniform like petals around a pistil . Jack was rigid with guilt at his cousin 's departure , for as a seminarian he was draft-exempt . He dealt with his embarrassment by , on the one hand , extolling the righteousness of the Allied cause , and , on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  four years , to be precise  --  for him to be ordained and appointed a military chaplain . Deirdre , by then a nurse at Carney Hospital , pointed out to Jack the macabre and inappropriate character of this hope . She was more shrill and carping than ever . Maureen said very little , never releasing Collins 's hand . Maeve kept giving him orders about food and clothing , to which he seemed to pay close attention . Colman said nothing to his son , standing on the edge of the circle , smoking a lot , keeping an eye on the big clock that hung from the fists of the naked angels over the informationbooth . What Colman remembered best about his boy was the lack of fear . His certainty had matched his posture . What Colman remembered best about himself was how he kept thinking , The things that boy does n't know ! But what could he have said ? Keep your chin on your chest ? Protect yourself ? Do n't jab with your left unless your right is cocked . Goddamn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And do n't confuse fighting for your life with fighting for someoneelse 's . And for God 's sake , save your best for your fight ! Listen to me , son . Your father knows something . Here are the rules : if they come at you with a knife , do n't move until they do ; if with a gun , wait until you can touch it , then you must move first . There are no good shots or bad at ten yards . Remember , you are faster acting than reacting . So is your enemy . Give him nine of what he anticipates . The tenth is yours and will win forp301you . Never trust the general . Always trust the sergeant , to whom you must never lie . To the general you must never tell the entire truth . Do not feel sorry for the men who die . Do not ride in an open car on roads with ridges nearby and no cover . Do not stop if a dray full of bottles has been turned over in the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himBrady was stunned by the string of his thoughts , its final knot , Michael Collins , C-in-C , the big fellow in green with the Sam Browne and the Aussie bush hat , dead . Michael Collins whom he , when younger than his own son , had loved and therefore failed . Brady snapped as a sailor snaps a tangled line that length of memory , and he saw himself standing on the road as Purcival 's Lancia screeched to a halt in front of him . He remembered the quick movement with which he had pulled the pistol from his tunic and the force with which he 'd pressed it against Purcival 's cheek and the authority with which he 'd said , " Move and you 're dead ! " Where the hell , he wondered now , had he gotten such nerve ? He remembered how his son froze when they announced his train . " Capital Limited ! All aboard for Washington , Richmond , and points en route ! All aboard ! " Colman had looked up at the clock that hung from the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . It had been a glorious spring day in Boston . Inside the unclothed vault of South Station it was always night . It was always cold . " I guess , Dad , " Collins had said , " this is it . " " Yes , son , it is . " " Well . " The boy was still cocky and sure . He seemed to have completelyeliminated from his consciousness the winter event of his thwarted rebellion and Colman 's blows . Colman , on the other hand , when he was with the boy alone , thought of little else . " There are some things I wanted to say to you , son , but . . " Aunt Maeve covered it all . " " Right . " " But I wanted to say something to you , Dad . " " You did ? " " Yes . I 'm glad that . . . " Collins paused , but more for effect than out of awkwardness . Brady thought his poise remarkable , but  --  and this was stimulated perhaps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under fire . " . . . that I finished out the year . It feels right having ended one phase before beginning the next . " " Good , son . I knew you 'd see it that way . " " I do , Dad . " Thanks for making me see it . " His son 's concession had a depressing effect on Brady . It emlxxlied perfectly what had gone wrongp302between them . The father wanted the son 's acquiescence in everything , but when he had it , he resented his son 's surrender . Collins , knowing that , was turning his surrender into a farewell gift , a punishment , an act of vengeance . " There is something , son . " " What ? " " I 'll be thinking about you all the time . " " Me too , Dad . " " And I want you to write to me . " " I will . I must go . " " Goodbye , dear , " Maeve said , kissing him . The two girls hugged him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own uniform , the black clericalsuit and tie . Collins turned back to his father , whose eyes went back and whose mind went back , back until they were fixed on Nellie saying , " I am . You are . But another time . Not now . " How he had loved her ! How he loved this boy ! How he had hoped to spare him all jeopardy ! They embraced each other , not emotionally , and then his son walked confidently away from him , turning back only when Colman called out " Amico ! " and waved . Brady looked out the window . The train was passing through Jamaica Plain , picking up speed , blurring the drab scene of the backsides of flaked gray three-deckers . Here and there families were at their supper on their porches . They waved like laundry , not resenting the intrusion of the locomotive whizzing down the track that kept their houses filthy . Brady had no impulse to wave back at them . Curley lived in J.P. , and Brady thought of him . His house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile from the spot they were passing . Poor Curley . Demolished by Lodge in ' 36 , defeated narrowly for mayor by his own boy Maurice Tobin in ' 37 , creamed for governor by Leverett Saltonstallin ' 38 , defeated for mayor again in ' 40 by Tobin , this time hugely . The old codger was talking up a run for Congress in ' 43 , but now he was his own cartoon and everyone knew it but him . All things doomed to die touch the heart . Curley had the capacity to believe himself capable of everything but death . " Tickets , please ! " the conductor bellowed from the rear of the car . Brady bought his ticket from him and then asked the way to the dining car . He went back to it . In the dining car he found a table by himself , but was soon joined by a pair of spinster teachers whom he resented instantly , not so much for theirp303pursed lips , their bunned-up hair , or their clacking nosiness as for their being not much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he knew he 'd get the cardboard box they shipped it in , but before the waiter came one of the women said , " I think I 'll have the veal . " And the other said , " You ca n't , Marie . It 's Friday . " Neither could he , goddamn it . " The scrod , please , " Brady said when the waiter arrived , a lanky black whose subservience was as artfully creased as his white jacket . " So will I , " Marie said , regret in her voice . " Are you together ? " the waiter asked . He seemed to address the silverware , the dishes , not the threesome . " Oh , no , " Marie said , blushing ; " I 'm sorry . " The waiter finished taking Brady 's order , then , flourishing a new and separate check , began the ladies ' . Brady lit a cigarette . In the silence after the waiter 's departure he smiled at the women pleasantly , but took no initiative toward conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ate their meal in silence . Brady was the first to pay his bill and leave . He smiled at them again as he excused himself . No sooner had he gone than Marie said to her companion , " For a Catholic , was n't he rude ? " Brady stopped in the parlor car long enough to have a brandy . By the time he returned to his seat it was dark , the cabin lights had been dimmed , and the window was like an ebony mirror . Brady rested his cheek against it and let the sound of the train wheels cracking the tracks lull him . Gradually his mind gave up its focus and he worked a vacuous hypnosis on himself by staring blankly into his own eyes . Curley . James Michael Curley . Twenty years before he 'd cut such a splendid figure , a man in his prime . Brady told himself again it had been an act of wisdom , not foolishness , to throw in with Curley , despite how it ended . Brady knew what his mistake had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely because he knew about it . The knowledge of evil does not protect from it . Brady felt a rush of his old disappointment . The attempt to conquer fortune can be defeated by time and by death , and by your homeland and by your heroes . All Brady had wanted , really , from the outset was a certain place from which to expend what energy he had been given ; a place of his own to share with loved ones and improve a bit and hand on to his son . He had begun by assumingthat Four Mile Water was that place , given him by his father , who had lived and died the center of an order which made such grants inevitaHeand perfect . But that world  --  how fragile it was !  --  fell apart whenp304one intruder violated it . Purcival withdrew a linchpin , setting off a sequential collapse which left Brady with nothing , not even the feeling of having caused it . He arrived in Boston with the sense that he had been thrown there and an absolute determination to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boston was where , having fallen back on his own resources , he discovered how considerable they were , and how dependable . He understood then that what order and hierarchy his world would have , it would get from him . A dreadful and lonely business , but Brady had taken to it and learned that he was not altogether unsuited for it . By God , he had roared through those first years , throwing off the bur- dens of other men 's prescriptions and expectations until he had only one left : Curley 's . If Brady had the feeling he had failed himself  --  and he did  --  it was because Curley had discarded him before he had Curley . Curley , like Purcival , like De Valera , like Gavin , had hit him by surprise and changed everything . Brady had had an enormous confidence in his ability to assess the layout of his terrain . Yet he had failed exactly in that and repeatedly . He was the connoisseur of ambush who had been am- bushed terribly . Once he went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's shadow , a guest in an alien place , a perma- nent stranger , a man without a spot of his own . If that was what was left to Brady he would take it and , by God , make a masterpiece of it , because now he took his meaning from something new . Colman was living to see that what had happened to him did not happen to his son . If Colman had inherited a fragile niche from his father , Collins would have a place to keep and to be kept by , a trustworthy place , a permanent place . Brady 's ironic sense of himself was as a man who had not successfully made it from one side of the ocean to the other . He had made his departure but , finally , no arrival . His son had made the crossing , or was making it , and Colman was behind him all the way . It was not the grand purpose a mansets out with , but it was a purpose , and Colman Brady clung to it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the boy 's growing like ahawk , ready to swoop down and save him from his enemies . " Stockbridge ! Stockbridge ! " the conductor cried , disturbing theslumber of the entire car . Brady continued to stare into his own eyeswhile the train slowed . It seemed to him he could just make out figuresrunning through a wood : a boy , a man , a woman . It was all those yearsago , the day he 'd met Madeline and they 'd chased after Micko , thinkinghim dead . When he 'd begun his affair with Madeline two years before , he 'd already come to feel like a traveler without a ticket of his own , andthat was exactly what had brought them together . They both had felt thatway . Circumstances had dropped Colman between continents and left himthere . He met her . She was between continents because her son had diedp305in the ocean , and she had lost the purpose of her life before she knewshe 'd had it . Brady was just starting to admit the thought that Madeline hadchanged things for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadregularly enjoyed each other 's company , arranging their meetings to keepthem private and taking pains to understand each other and be kind toeach other . It had started with that as the simple motive , in fact . Theywere both so weary of defeat and solitude . Kindness was what theywanted , and the delights of sexual pleasure ; such rarities , and they hadthem in abundance . Madeline had changed and for the better , and that was evident by herpresence in Stockbridge again at last . But Brady now saw how he waschanged too perhaps . Nothing required that what he and Madeline weredoing had to end in defeat . He had assessed this terrain carefully , morecarefully than any before it . He was still cautious , for example , in usinglanguage that would make him vulnerable to her . He had not yet told herthat he loved her . He could not say that until he was prepared to drag outthe old dream of a place of his own and ask her to share it with him . Heknew that Madeline was offering of it stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how afraid he was of yet anotherfailure ! But how he loved her and how he longed to tell her ! " Stockbridge , mister , " the conductor scolded . " You paid for Stock-bridge . " " Yes , " Colman said . " Thank you . " He was the only passenger to disembark at Stockbridge . A tall white-haired stationmaster greeted him  --  " Evening ! "  --  withthe clipped enunciation of a rural Yankee . Colman nodded at him , then stood beside him to watch the train pullout . " She 's late , " the station man said . " What time is it ? " " Nine-thirty . " Brady nodded again , and , bag in hand , entered the large room that , with its cubbyhole in the corner , comprised the entire railroad station . But the place was a gem of rough stone , sweeping upward in multiangledlofts . A huge fireplace dominated the space . On its hearth was a polishedoak plank with the legend , " Welcome to travelers ! Speed the departingguest . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite itsemptiness . " Stantard White , " the master said.  | " Sorry ? " " Stanford White . Eighteen eighty-two . " " Oh , " Brady nodded . " He designed Madison Square Garden , you know . Then got hisself murdered , they tell me , by his floozie . " " That so ? " Brady touched the stone wall . " Granite ? " " Nope . Rough marble . Looks like granite , though . He used to come up here summers . " " Who ? " " White . Usually get lots of folks up here summers . But this war now , seems like everybody stays home . There 's no taxi , not at night . " The mantugged at his broad white moustache , openly studying Brady . " Is the town nearby ? " " Down the road , past the feed barn . " " A hotel ? " " Red Lion . Seventeen seventy-three . " " That right ? " " Yup . Get a drink there , too , if you like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brady paused , then kicked himself for pausing . " . . . the clinic ? " " Clinic ? " The man stared at him blankly . " Austen Riggs 's clinic . " " You mean the Center . They do n't call it a clinic . Doctor Riggs do n't allow no one to call it a clinic . " " Where would that be ? " " Across the street . " Brady turned , as if to look . " From the Red Lion . Across the street , catty-corner . Main Street . " " Thank you , " Brady said . He sensed from the way the man was looking at him that he thought he was an arriving patient . Brady drew himself up and shook off his uneasiness . He straightened his tie , eliminated his disheveled air and bent posture . He stared at the stationmaster until the latter looked away , as if that small triumph wouldsay to him , No , mister , not me . I 'm not mad , you see , at all . Brady turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad to its memories , and the quaint stationhouse to its connotations.  | " I KNOW who you are . " " I ca n't imagine that you do . " " You 're her friend . So am I. I 'm Ruth Koch . Nice to meet you , Mr. Brady . " " Are you her doctor ? " " You did n't expect a woman ? " " Well , I . . . " " Or a Jew , either ? " " I was under the impression this is a very . . . how should I say it ? " " Swish ? " " No . WASPish . A very WASPish place . " " It is . " " I might have known . Italian gardeners . Irish maids .

She 's off to an excellent start . Does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May I tell you something , Mr. Brady ? You 're very good for her . She 's taken hold of herself in part because of you . " " How much longer do you think she 'll be here ? " " Oh , a while yet . We must n't rush it . Our guests are here typically a year or more . Madeline was here twice before , but she did n't stay with it . She was n't ready . " " I know how much she had been wanting to come here . It took her a long time to feel strong enough , I think . She 's not seriously . . . ? I do n't know how to ask it . " " Ill ? " Doctor Koch smiled . " Who is n't ? Madeline 's illness takes the form of a chemical addiction that 's very hard to break . We do some of the best treatment in the country here , Mr. Brady , and I think you 'll sense the difference as time goes along . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I said , that 's partly due to you . "  | " She 's a fiery woman , doctor . Hard to keep up with . " " She 's had her outbursts with you , has n't she ? " Brady smiled . God , had she , right from the beginning when she 'd nearly taken his thumb off . " What she needed , " the doctor continued , " was someone strong enough to teach her that her expressions of her feelings would not be damaging , even if they were negative ones . She had to have a way to get those feelings out instead of turning them against herself in self-destructivebehavior . She 's in your debt , Mr. Brady . " " Has her husband been here ? " " No . " " Do you expect him ? " " You should discuss that with Madeline . She would want to know you 're here . " " I thought I 'd let her finish the lesson . I enjoy watching her play . " " I hope you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm glad you 're here . Good-bye . " " Good-bye . " Brady watched the woman walk back across the tailored lawn to the sprawling white mansion  --  the MOB , the Medical Office Building  --  that was set like a jewel on the slight crest under stately elms . Adjacent to the MOB was a second white mansion , nearly as gracious ; the Inn , where the guests resided . The Austen Riggs Center had more the feel of a country club than a hospital . Madeline was hitting a series of backhands powerfully and deftly . Her white tennis skirt emphasized the tan of her legs , her long slim legs , which Brady regarded as her best , most seductive feature . From the bench on the low rise where he sat she looked good , very good . Her blond ponytailswatted the air behind her head . She moved around the right rear corner of the red clay with the grace and lithe ease of a dancer . At the point in her swing where the racquet was extended fully away , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum follow-through , Brady could just make out the curves of her breasts . She looked fresh and young and very beautiful . Brady thought , sitting there in the soft morning light , he had never seen anyone so beautiful . Brady would gladly have spent the day watching her . But the lesson ended , and she left the court with the dark Latin who 'd instructed her politely . They shook hands and separated . Madeline draped a sweater over her shoulders , hooked her racquet under her arm , and began walking across the grass on her way to the Inn . She would have to pass within a few feet of his bench . He did not move.  |p309She  saw him . She stopped dozens of yards away . He read her fear , felt it rolling in on him , waves . " Hello , sweet , " he said . She heard him and moved toward him slowly . He stood as she drew near and opened his arms for her , taking her in silently . They held each other . Each was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet . " " Colman Brady , " she said , as if the recitation of his name was an achievement . There had been moments when she feared that even so much as to say his name would be to lose him . " Colman Brady . " There had been other moments when she 'd regarded his name as a hoard of ice beneath her tongue for use against the summer . " Colman Brady . " " Yes . I am . " " Colman , I love you . " She spoke the words directly and so selfassuredlythat he realized she had decided weeks before to greet him with them . " I know you do . " He had still , after more than two years , not said as much to her . He did not know why . " I 'm crazy about you , " he said . She smiled , accepting his profession , and remembered how they were different . Colman was afraid and cautious . She was crazy . " No , " she said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " That 's true . " He lined her chin with his forefinger . " Well , let 's say I 'm mildly interested in you . " " Well , " she cracked , " if that 's all , then you are crazy . " " Perhaps you should have me committed . " He slid his arm around her waist as they began to walk toward the Inn . " Let me change and we 'll do something . " " Are you free ? " " Of course . Even if committed . ' " " Funny word . " " Committed ? Yes . Hilarious . " " Shall I wait here ? " " No . Come in . They wo n't bite you . " " Who ? " " The wolves , witches , and warlocks . Neither will the patients . " They entered the Inn by a small back door , went down a dark corridor and into the gleaming entrance foyer . Madeline showed Colman into the living morn , a high-ceilinged room with fleur-de-lys wallpaper , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Anne wingbacks , and a Chippendale sof , i . Fresh flowers in discreet bouquets gave off their scent.  |p310The  morning sunlight was streaming in through a large bay window . A breeze graced the gauze curtain . " In a jif , " she said , going off . Brady stood in the bridge of the window , looking out on the sedate front lawn , Main Street , the gables of a mansion above the trees across the way . He lit a cigarette and wondered how long it had been since a day had passed , an entire day , without a thought of her . He could not recall . He succeeded only in summoning the pain , momentary and intense , that always came with her image in his mind . He had written two letters to her weeks before , shortly after she 'd come to Riggs . In one he 'd told her that she was everything to him and that he could not think of life without her . In the other he 'd said , simply , good-bye . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his bed , which he never read . He considered the pain he felt at the thought of her , turning it over in his mind , clinically almost , as if it was someone else 's . He wondered what term to give it and considered again that perhaps it was hate . But that was too large a term . Hate was for other things . But hate , he thought , is a pain like this . The pain dissolved when he was with her , and now he would be . " Ready ? " " That was fast . " ' He looked about for a place to snuff his cigarette . She was wearing a pleated skirt , a cashmere sweater , pearls . " I do n't want to waste a minute . " " How much time do we have ? " " Only all day . It 's Saturday . No group . " He found an ashtray on an endtable . She held her hand out to him . He took it . She started to lead him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressed in white , were going out ahead of them . Madeline dropped his hand , winked at him and whispered , " They think I 'm married . " What could he say ? Instead of veering left on Main Street toward the center of the picturesqueNew England village , as Brady expected they would , Madeline set off in the other direction . They walked by a weathered gray cabin that sat primly on the corner of Main and Sargeant streets . Madeline pointed to it . " That 's the Mission House . Jonathan Edwards or somebody ran a missionto the Indians . " " What Indians ? " " The Stockbridge Indians . " " That 's an Indian name , is it ? " She shrugged . " That 's what they called them . " " They were probably English Indians . Anglicans , no doubt . "  | " Not Jonathan Edwards . " " Well , he was probably trying to convert them to animism . " " You 're silly . " " I 'm interested .

" " Stanford White designed it . " " He designed the railway depot . " " He did ? " " Yes . He used to summer here . " " You 're making that up . " " No . Really . Just before he founded his school . Stanford . Never heard of it , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , punching him . He took advantage of her motion to free his hand and embrace her firmly by the shoulders . He kissed her . They were standing directly in front of a small brown house . She gave him such a weighty look when he pulled his face back from hers that he said , " You do n't mind , darling , do you ? " " No , Colman , how could I mind ? I 'm so happy to have you back . " " You seem grave . " " I felt terrible for weeks about us . I did n't know if I 'd see you . I did n't know if I 'd hurt you . " " Of course you hurt me . You always do . " " I do n't mean to . " A curtain fluttered in a window in the brown house . " They 're looking at us , " he said . " I do n't care .

" " Where 's Thornton ? " " He 's been in Tangiers . He 's coming back . " " When ? " " To Washington , I mean . " Brady could feel her hands working the flesh below the blades in his upper back . She was looking at him intently . He allowed himself to sink into the small concentric circles of her eyes ; the black pupil , the bluegreeniris with its distinctly dark margin , the field of white . She was drawing him into herself through her eyes , as she always did . At that moment they were gentle and apologetic . " Do I hurt you really ? " " No , " he said quickly . It was a lie . Only lately had he admitted to himself that she did hurt him . The pain of her absence was excruciating . That was what he hated . " You make me very happy , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she smiled , still fiercely gazing at him  --  " . . . so morosely . " " Delectatio Mortis , " he said . " The happiness of . . . " He rejected the exact word . The English could be so harsh . " . . . the morose . " He shudderedinwardly at having veered so close to the word death . All things doomed to die . . . " You classicist , you . " " No , altar boy . " They resumed their walk , hand in hand . " Speaking of which , " she said , " I want to show you the Catholic church . It 's a gem . " " Stanford White ? " " No , the late , great God , I think . An Italian , in any case . " " Is it up this way ? " " No , it 's the other side of the village . I 've something else to show you first . A graveyard . " They had drawn up to the town cemetery . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high , narrow , and thin in the old fashion , kept their rigid vigil . Only a few tilted this way and that . The grass was well tended . Altogether , the place achieved an order , warmth , and friendliness that made the prospect of a stroll through it not unpleasant . Brady said , " And you call me morose . " " But I wanted to show you something , " she insisted , leading him in . She did not speak again for the several minutes it took to walk the length of the cemetery . At the far right corner was a grove of trees , excep/tionally tall pines , the boughs of which obscured the center of the grove where there was a small , separate burial place . Dozens , perhaps a hundred tombstones were arranged in a circle around two large monuments , one an obelisk , the other a draped marble urn . " The Sedgwick Pie , " she said . Brady took in the scene silently , unsure what he was expected to make of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beneath this stone are deposited . Brady dropped Madeline'shand and approached the fifteen-foot obelisk  --  " . . the remains of theHonorable Theodore Sedgwick who died in Boston , January 24 ad 1813 , aged66 . Brady looked back at Madeline , who nodded toward the urn , which was a mere seven or eight feet high and separated from the obelisk by barely two full paces . " Pamela Sedgwick died in Boston September 20 , 1807 aged 54 . She was a Christian humble without meanness , pious without bigotry . . . " Brady skipped the saccharine litany to read the last line : " . . . erected by her devoted husband . " " Erected . . . , " he repeated , looking up at the obelisk , " . . . indeed . " He gazed back at Madeline , thinking of her naked . She was readinganother stone . He joined her . " Elizabeth Freeman . Known by the name of Mumbet . Died December 28 , 1829 .

She never violated a trust nor failed to perform a duty . In every situation of domestic trial she was the most efficient helper and the tenderest friend . Good mother farewell . " " Jesus ! " Brady said . " Is n't it touching ? " " Touching ? " Colman looked at Madeline , whose eyes were still on the stone , fondly on the stone . " No. " he said . " It is not touching .

" William Dwight Sedgwick , April 16 , 1873 . " " He was a leading abolitionist , " she said , her voice flat , distant . " They all were . " " That is admirable , Madeline .

He was surprised at the simple , direct question , and he knew it was an opportunity , a first one , to let her see what life , what sad life , she sustained in him.  | " Nothing , " he said . She crossed to him and put her lips against his cheek . It seemed to him that she was telling him to be brave . He felt her breath on his neck like mist .

" When she pulled away from him there was a grove in her eyes , its center obscured by boughs . She had tried to admit him . He had not understood or known how to follow , and he knew it . He touched her hair , fingered the elastic that held it in a ponytail . " You look so young with your hair like that . " " It 's too long . I did n't cut it this spring . " " Do n't ever cut it . " " All right . Never . For you . " It seemed to them both that the bad moment had passed and that they had survived it and that the scent of juniper filled the air . Though they were not sure . They left the cemetery , retraced their way down Main Street , hand in hand even by Riggs . They sauntered by the shops of the village , browsing the windows . " That 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest white frame house on a corner . " That 's what they say in the Saturday Evening Post . " At Elm Street they turned right and walked past the fire station and crossed the street . " There , " she said , announcing the church as if it were handiwork of hers . The church was a gothic miniature made of crisp gray stone with a small rose window over the entrance and a strong martial belfry with a notched border around its pinnacle . There were mock buttresses on the sides , separating windows that achieved a modest glory with their pointed arches . Madeline had called it a gem and it was . An embodiment of a sensibilitythat was medieval and European , it stood on the edge of Stockbridgeas a shocking repudiation of the spare native aesthetic . Churches in New England were all white steeples and pillars and clear blown glass and righteous angles . This church was a mistake and a defiance at once . " St. Joseph 's , " Madeline said . " Is n't it wonderful ? " Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to Mass inp316London the morning after the treaty was signed . He never felt so Catholic as when out of Ireland , out of Southie . " You like it ? " he asked , a little surprised . " It reminds me of Italy . I love Italy . I love France . I love cathedrals . Have you been to Chartres ? " " No . " " Oh , Chartres is wonderful ! You must read Henry Adams on Chartres . " " I have . " " My grandfather went with him once . " " Well , I 'm privileged to have such a well-connected guide to the cultureof Roman Catholicism . " He laughed . " You people ! " " Do n't ' you people ' me , you ! " She hugged him . " Really , " he said , " it takes dull outsiders to reveal genius to itself . " " Great artists , " Madeline recited , " require great audiences . " " Precisely . As your fellow Whitman almost put it . " " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ! " " ' I exist as I am , that is enough. / If no other in the world be aware I sit content. / And if each and all be aware I sit content ! ' " Brady remembered the scene with the commandant in the safe house . He had pitied him for thinking those lines true . " Rubbish . Whitman could write rubbish too . " She pressed with her arm at his waist . No stoic solitude for you , mister ! " What 's that stone ? " Colman asked . A single tombstone was nestled against the side of the church , neglected and isolated . " Oh , " Madeline said , bringing her hand to her face , " I 'd forgotten . " " What is it ? " He approached the grave , hauling her after him . The stone was cracked . The plot it marked was overgrown . The earth was slightly collapsed as if there was a cavity below at just that spot . Brady read the inscription out loud . ' Jane Sedgwick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Februariis XX , MDCCCXX . What 's that , eighteen twenty ? Mortua in Washington , D.C. Februariis XII , MDCCCLXXXIX . That 's eighteen eighty-nine , right ? Fide Fortis et Amore . Strong in faith and love . " He looked at Madeline , waiting for her to explain . " I 'd forgotten . " " So you said . " " She built the church . " " She was a Catholic ? " " Yes . Isaac Hecker converted her . Do you know him ? " " No . " " A prominent Yankee . Brook Farm , Emerson , Thoreau , all that . **26;4823;TOOLONG failed he became a Catholic and a priest . He had a fol-lowing . " " Even a Sedgwick . " " Yes . " " Which is why she 's buried here . " " Yes . " " The only one outside the Pie . " " Yes . In two hundred years . " " Jesus ! Mumbet in , Jane out ! " " It 's not what you think . " " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostracized . " " Well ? " " It worked the other way , Colman . " There was a stern edge to Madeline'svoice . " As a Catholic she could not be buried in profane ground . The Sedgwicks were very hurt . They loved her . " Those words affected him . Brady hated himself when he was testy with her . His priggish bigotry was what he pulled over his nervousness . Why was Madeline taking him on a tour of the burial places of her kin ? She was making him very uneasy , but he could not tell her that . He could not tell her that he was desperately afraid they 'd be impossible to each other . What could he do but disguise his anguish as offended prejudice ? " They wanted her for their collection , you mean . She ruined the record . " " That 's not fair . " " In any case . . . "  --  Colman touched the neglected stone with his toe  --  " . . . this is pretty pathetic , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw it . " " I wonder where the other Catholics are buried . Surely some have died . Surely some have lived in Stockbridge . " " Perhaps , " she said , " even a converted Sedgwick would desecrate their cemetery . " Colman shrugged . The hopelessness of it . Life teaches , if it teaches at all , that some things just ca n't be managed . Not even by death . " Requiescat in pace , " he said in a low serious voice . Madeline put her hand on his arm and pressed it . He covered her hand with his own . " Amen , " she said . " Amen . " They walked to the Red Lion Inn to eat lunch . The inn 's dining room , with its red carpeting and embossed windsor chairs , white wainscoting , old chandeliers , hurricane-lamp wall fixtures , and small Victorian mirrors , embodied the constrained dignity of another century . As they were being shown to a table Colman and Madeline noticed the tables in thep318courtyard just through the French doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was warm and brilliant . They wanted , if possible , nothing between them and the day 's loveliness . A waiter made an appearance in the small courtyard , nodded stiffly and asked if they wanted drinks . He was wrong for the place , not an upcountryYankee youth , but a city fellow from New York probably . Efficiencyjust one side of curtness ; like his hair , which was an achievement of wet , black slickness . One could have focused a camera on the thin white line of his part . " Yes , please , " Colman said . " I 'd have a beer . " " And you , ma'am ? " Madeline blushed . " No thank you , nothing . " The waiter went away . Colman studied Madeline , who studied the menu . He had never seen her refuse a drink . She looked up at him . " I 'm an alcoholic . " " I know . " He smiled , partly out of affection for her at the innocence of her admission , partly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that chaos . " I 've known it for years . " She returned his smile and matched his mood . " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Because I 'm not a doctor . " " It is a disease , you know . You must n't moralize with me anymore . " " Moralize ? Who ? " " You . The more you moralize the worse I feel , and the worse I feel the more I need a drink . Give me a cigarette , would you ? " He did . " That 's the medical theory , is it ? " He grinned . She nodded . " I thought it was just that you liked the hell out of the stuff . " " I hate it . " The waiter brought Colman 's beer . " Will it bother you if I have this ? " She was touched by the concern in his voice . " No , darling , of course not . " She watched him drink . " I feel no desire for it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tablecloth . " Colman , I think I 'm really better . " " I think you are , too . " " Do you ? " " Yes . " He reached across the table toward her hand . He let his fingers float just above hers like a wing of bees pollinating . " I 've learned some important lessons already , " she said . " Like what ? " " Thirst grows the more you drink . I 'm not talking about booze , either.  |p319I  'm talking about throwing your head back in the rain , to drink that . Or going down into a crystal pond with your mouth open . Colman , the more you live the more you want to live ! " He thought she said that wonderfully , so youthfully , as if she 'd just thought it , just discovered it . And of course she had . Was n't that the point ? " But it 's like that with booze , too . The thirst is always . . . " She stopped . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled his fingers into hers . " Looking at you is like being able to see the fruit ripen . " " Oh , do n't say that ! " " Why ? " " Because I 'm overripe and I know it . " He understood what she meant . It was true . " Do you know what I 've been talking about to Dr. Koch ? " she asked . He listened carefully . " My dollhouse . " " Your dollhouse ? " " Yes . It 's in the attic with the parakeet cage and the mannikins . I 've not seen it in years . Yet I 've thought of it often and I can describe it in detail , everything perfect and little and inviolate : glazed chickens , a rockingchair the size of your smallest nail , a Lilliputian writing desk with a pewter inkwell and feather-pen like a sliver of dust . It 's a good house . The windows open and close . My grandfather 's carpenter made it . Every room was papered to scale . What always pleased me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as mine . I 'd always expected to give it to my daughter , that house with the flowers perfect forever and the gleaming fruit that never spoiled . Nothing was ever overripe in that house , do you see ? It was . . . " She paused , drawing her fingers out of Brady 's and reaching to his face , tracing the edge of his chin , smiling at him , stroking him as if he lived there with her . " . . . incorruptible . " " It still is , " he said . " Yes . " She withdrew her hand . " But now as a kind of mockery . " " Do you really think that ? " " Yes . Yes . I tried to make Pride 's Crossing into a doll 's house in which one would never bid adieu to guests or to friends or to . . . " " Lovers , " he said suddenly , surprising himself . She ignored the word . " . . . or to spring . But rats to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who the hell wants to live in a doll 's house ? If it was always spring : one , I would n't have met you in the winter , and two . . . " She slid her hand into his again . " I would n't be here with you in the summer . "  |p320Brady  was aware of the shifting shadows of fine pointed elm leaves trembling in the shelter of the courtyard . He received her affection , took it into his own for her , cherishing both affections exactly because they were so corruptible . He let his eyes fall to her fingers and stared to see what it was they were touching . The shining curves of her hand stirred the memory of that other curve , the primordial one , of two lying together on a bed of morning light , the curve of flesh . " What else have you learned ? " he asked . " What the sky feels like before it snows . " He smiled at her fancy . " . . . How stretched and gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been piling up . " " A strange thought for summer . " " Summer is the release . " " I have the impression , Madeline , that you have n't snowed yet . " " Do I seem stretched and gray and desperate ? " " You seem . . . I must be careful , since my last metaphor offended you . . . but it 's the quality of , well , ripeness . Call it readiness . Call it release . I think you 're approaching it . " " Call it pregnancy . " " What ? " Colman 's shock offended her . It said , " At your age ! " " A metaphor , darling , a metaphor . I 'm giving birth to myself . " The waiter appeared then , his pen poised for their order . They made their selections as much to be rid of him as to have the food prepared . Madeline buttered a piece of bread and ate it , sweeping the crumbs continually . Brady was conscious of their two shadows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shadows did not speak . The bread was crumbling in her hands . " It 's curious , is n't it ? " he asked , a vague , deliberate opening . " Yes . " " How we hate our years , the best ones , until we 've left them behind , then , later , scramble for them , trying to remember everything . " " I know so little , Colman , of what you 've left behind . " He shrugged . " First Erin . Then Beantown . " " And now ? " " I 'm not scrambling yet . For anything , unless perhaps I 'm scrambling a little bit , inside , for you . " " It 's about time , " she said , hiding her pleasure in her embarrassment . " It is . It 's about time I stopped flinging away what I . . . "  --  he let his reluctance express itself in his hesitation  --  " . . . will only need later . "  | " I feel that way too. , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colman had sole in a lemon sauce , Madeline a minute steak . " Your son , " she said after her first bite , " how is he ? " " Good , I think . Have I told you he 's in the army ? " " No , but I assumed that he would be . " " He was anxious to join up . He 's in the tank corps . " " Patton ? " " Yes . " " He 's from Boston , you know . " " I know . " " Are you worried ? " Colman shrugged . " What can happen with a Beacon Hill general in charge ? " He smiled , then cut it abruptly . " Of course I 'm worried . This is going to be a vicious war . There 's only one way to fight it . " " How ? " " Going in . They have to go in through France . The Germans will destroythem . I hope to God Micko gets a staff job . I 've been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How ? " " Bribery . " He stared at her . He was not joking . " An Undersecretary of the Army . I gave him five thousand dollars . I 'm waiting to hear . " Madeline did not react . She had no idea how he expected her to react . She felt kicked in the stomach . " Your son would hate that , Colman . " " You 're right . I 'll tell you something else ; he 'd hate me . But he 'll never know . " " Perhaps not . " She was n't eating . She trailed her fork along the vein that angled across her steak . " And Madeline , " he said , sensing her retreat , " I 'll tell you something . I le 'd be wrong . There 's no reason in the world why he should die in this war . And I 'll stop at nothing to see that he does n't . " " Well , " she said , touching her napkin to her mouth and reaching a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less . You 've certainly come a long way , Mr. Brady . " Colman looked at her . How could he tell her the fact of it , how far indeed he 'd come ? How far from innocence and simplicity , how far from Ireland , perhaps ? He tried to deflect his feelings , which came fast , arrows , shafts of light through the elm canopy . He knew that his admission of bribery had made Madeline uneasy . But the real problem was his fearful effort to manipulate the circumstances of his son 's life , which he did because he was so afraid of a life of his own . If Madeline was uneasy it was not with his bribery , but with the default on his own prospects to whichp322it pointed . If he had any hope of changing that , it would be with her , but she would have to understand more , so much more . He decided to try to tell her . " Madeline , there are things about me you do n't know . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went on , smiling a bit and showing a gentle irony . " If you and I have a problem it 's that you think communion is the result of communicationbecause you 're a Protestant . We Catholics think that communionis prior , not the other way . That 's why we do n't give two hoots for sermons . " " Is that what you wanted to tell me ? " " No . That 's just a digression on why this is difficult for me . What the hell do I know about communication ? " " Confession , Colman . You 're talking about confession . You Catholics do that all the time . " Madeline 's strong and exact statement surprised him . Of course , confession . He decided to start with what was most shocking . " I killed severalmen when 1 was young . That changed everything for me . Do you know why ? Not because the actual killings were wrong or unnecessary , but because , once started , it made no difference to me whether they were wrong or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was more alive than I ever was before or have been since , when I was blowing men 's brains out . " He stopped talking , but the train of thought went on : but now , Madeline , I 've begun to think or hope that I could be more alive even than that with you . The thought stunned him . Why could n't he say it ? " So what do you think ? " he asked . Madeline thought his statement so self-punishing , yet so devoid of the barest hint of remorse , that she could make no response . He had shocked her not with the revelation of his deed , but with the disgust for himself it left him with . He seemed more regretful of his own loss of innocence than of his victims ' loss of life . He was a man who needed a huge dose of both rebuke and forgiveness . Could she , honestly , offer either ? " I do n't know , Colman , " she said . Brady let out a faint snort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were . " Well , it 's a long way from honor , duty , and love of country I 've come , do n't you think ? " " I suppose . It serves me right for asking what raggedy clothing you 'd flung off . " " Or not flung off . I think and act in curved lines , Madeline . I 'd have expected you to know that . " " We all do , Colman , but there are some times when we shouldn't. "  | " Like wartimes . " She shrugged . " You know all about it , " he said . " No . " " Well , I do . " " I doubt it . " " Do n't doubt it . War , dollhouses , fallen fruit , Austen Riggs . It 's all one issue ; how to survive . " " All right , Colman . How do I survive ? How do you ? We have to work that as best we can . For ourselves . But so does your son . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphors . The first five , ten , or fifty thousand blokes out of the ships and onto the ould sod are going to get their heads blown off . It 's that simple . And everybody knows it but them . If I can keep my kid off that beach for a week or two , until , say , the generals come ashore , well , I will . And he 'll have to take it from there . That 's fair enough . I just want my boy to have a chance , that 's all . " " I see what you mean . Perhaps it is worth the cost . " " Money is nothing . " " Not money . The cost to you , to your  --  forgive a big word  --  in-tegrity . " " My integrity ? You do n't know me well , do you ? My integrity weighs less than air . " Madeline decided to lay aside her new reservation about him . She would pretend she had not had that qualm . " I know you well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or belittled me to ennoble yourself . I know what integrity is , and what it weighs , and what it costs . I admire you . And trust you . Collins is lucky to have you for his father . " " Thank you . " Colman was surprised to find that he was moved by her tribute . She was offering him entry again through her eyes into whatever lay behind them . He took it , thinking for once that he knew ; her generouswill , which contained him the way the courtyard did the breeze . He could not resist her when she cupped her face with that look . She made him feel that his whole life lay before him like a field of wheat , neckhigh , waiting to be taken . He tried to squirm out of her fond gaze and the uneasiness her tribute stirred in him . He said , " I thought we were talking about Collins . " " Bribery , " she said , smiling . " We were talking about bribery . " " No , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confiding it in you . " He knew what she was thinking ; Thornton would never , in a million years , take a bribe or offer one . " Do you know what I 'm thinking ? " " Yes . "  | " It was bribery before , was n't it ? " " When ? " What was she thinking ? " That caused your . . . downfall . " " Not ' downfall , ' darling . " " You never told me about it . " " I told you it was n't what you thought . " " What was it ? " " Why do you ask ? " " I thought we 'd admitted it was time we toured each other 's closets . " " It had nothing to do with bribery . I arranged a pardon for a man who had me in his debt . Not financially . " " Morally ? " Colman shrugged . " Big word . But yes . " The murder of Jerry MacCurtain . Brady had not thought of it in years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stifle an unexpected grief . " What 's funny ? " " Your curiosity . It has been years after all , our liaison . Does n't it strike you as funny that we never exchanged these numbers ? " " No . " It struck her as sad . They had used their ignorance about each other as a refuge . " There 's much I 've never asked you too , Madeline . " " I know . Ask me something . " " No . " " Please . " He wanted to ask her in what way she still loved Thornton . But he did not , he could not . Instead he asked a false and sentimental question of the sort he thought she wanted . " Do you love yourself ? " " When I 'm with you , yes . " " And other times ? " " More and more . " He reached across the table to touch her face . " You know , do n't you , that what I want is for you to love yourself whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what Dr. Koch wants , too . " Brady realized that he had told her the truth , and it seemed suddenly ominous to him . He realized that it was precisely in such a sentiment that love does reside . But he could not speak of it further . He let his finger trace the bones of her face . Madeline was very moved , and her eyes filled . She watched him . When Brady 's finger brushed Madeline 's mouth she opened it and touched his skin with her tongue . The sensuous , shameless gesture stirred them both . " I wish we could go somewhere , Colman . "  | " We can . My room . " Madeline nodded . " When we finish ? " There was still food on both their plates . She shook her head and formed a word with her lips : Now . Then she bit his finger , almost hurting him . He winked at her . They laughed and rose . Colman told the waiter to put the bill on his tab . The waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding hands . A bit old , he thought , to be abandoning food , cuttingshort meals , rushing off in the afternoon . He put his forefinger , barely the tip of it , to the side of his head , which he scratched affectedly , yet without disturbing a single hair or its sleeve of oil . Colman 's room in the Red Lion was dominated by the great bed , with its tufted white spread , which was all the whiter for the pattern of violet flowers on the walls . Madeline went into the room and drew the blinds while Colman locked the door . She turned to face him from the window and he remained for a moment where he was . He realized for the first time how different she looked . She looked older . She looked sadder . She was not for once wearing the clothing or the expression of her counterfeit youth . She did not look voluptuous , he thought . She looked like the person he knew she was . They walked to each other slowly . While Colman unfastened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which held her hair , Madeline pushed her fingers between his teeth while rubbing her left knee into his groin until she could feel him stiffening . With a graceful familiaritythey undressed each other , fondling the clothing , the snaps and buttons , as though everything were flesh . When she was naked Colman knelt , his hands everywhere on her . With his tongue he traced her curves , the spaces and vacancies of her body , her breasts , the hollow below them , the line of her hip , her navel , the slight bulge of her abdomen , the hair at her crotch until he moved his tongue to her clitoris , the very tip of it . He began stroking her buttocks with his hands and pressing his tongue ever so lightly against the small knob of tissue which grew as he pressed more firmly , moving his head in a small circle around it . And cries , low cries came from her , as if she were a creature being dragged across its border . The pitch of response was intense beyond anythingBrady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hands and pressed him into her belly while he continued to play his tongue on her . She began to come in a sequence of climaxes , which were , he thought , distinct and separate , but which spilled into each other . It was as if she were lying hack in water , him supporting her , while unstoppable dizzying waves washed over her again and again and again . " Come to bed , " she said finally , drawing him up , having rememberedp326him , having remembered the ancient secret of women , that the man has so little to do with making that wound whole . Her hand stole down his body and he rose and she took his erection and fondled him . His face was flushed and she could feel the tension in him . She knew that nothing aroused him like her orgasms . " Come to bed , darling . " She lay down and opened h , , ' r arms and legs and waited for him . What she was ! Without any of her habitual embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that at last she was not imagining herself a perpetual youth . The lines of her age were all over her body , and finally , Brady understood , they were what made her so ravishingto him . Brady could not love someone whom time had not touched , and it had touched her gloriously . Her skin along the inside of her thighs and up into her pubic hair was like milk with tiny blue veins through it , which trembled as she arched herself up for him . Her legs and arms , her shoulders and her straight neck , were tawny and textured with fine creases . Everything in her ached for him and she let him see that . " You are beautiful , " he said , looking down on her . He held his passion in check for another moment to heighten it . He understood what made them one  --  the effort to do what seemed impossible . He was ready to risk everything again , not for this woman but with her . " You are beautiful , " he repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it , " she said . ON NOVEMBER 8 , 1942 , eleven months after Pearl Harbor , the American counterattack came . Three hundred thousand invaders , from a convoy of eight hundred ships , rushed in landing craft onto the shores of French Africa , surprising Europe and confusing America . Everyone had expected an assault across the Channel from England , or , at the outside , an attack from the south on the underside of France . But Africa ! Few understood that the Allies were far from equipped to meet their enemy head-on in Europe itself . Colman Brady and tens of thousands of American parents read accounts of the invasion in three , if possible four , newspapers a day . Many like him , who had never particularly formed the habit of listening to thep327radio , began listening to it constantly . People on buses and on the streets of Boston traded slivers of information as if they were coins . The operation  --  code-named Torch  --  went smoothly . The Germans and the Vichy French were as surprised as anyone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower moved his headquarters from a cavern under Gibraltar to a hill in Algiers , signaling the successful completion of the first great American initiative . Colman Brady had even less reason to worry than others because his son , 2d Lt. M. Collins Brady , was a communications officer in charge of a pool of radiomen at Headquarters Command . Throughout the invasion he had huddled by headsets , receivers , ticker-machines , and telegraph keys in the tunnel in the bowels of the Rock of Gibraltar . His duty was to organizeincoming information into intelligence briefings which other juniorofficers delivered at half-hourly intervals to senior staff , who further arrangedthe data into briefings which were presented every two hours to General Eisenhower and his task force commanders , Clark and Patton . Young Brady had been cruelly disappointed at his assignment . His first letter from overseas was written during his first break from duty at Gibraltar . " It is as if this rock , " he wrote , " came into existence for the precise purpose of keeping me out of the war . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the progress of the army  --  to be hearing them from here , the very womb of the earth ! I 've never been less vulnerable to physical harm in my life than I am now . That 's the damn army for you ! If you volunteer for the field they bury you in the ground . It 's probably the poor bastards who wanted this job who are leading the assault . I gather this is typical . " It would have suited Colman if the kid stayed inside Gibraltar for the entire war . But he knew that soon enough Collins would be on the line , if not across it , and he expected the boy would feel differently about the rock when it was n't overhead protecting him . All three of the letters Colman received from Gibraltar reflected the same frustration , but what began essentially as embarrassment at being safe while so many others were in jeopardy was transformed into resentment at being far removed from the valor and triumph of the unchallengedlanding . " A great victory for the Allies , " Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that victories presupposed the engagement and conquering of opponents . That the enemy did not resist the landing meant little to Brady ; perhaps the Germans were delighted to have the Allied fierce harmlessly in North Africa . What the hell was there but an infinity of ' sand which even the Italians did n't want ? Rommel was there . The genius of Eisenhower 's move revealed itself slowly that winter , for , by landing his tierce at Casablanca , ( ) ran , and Algiers , he was able **30;4851;TOOLONG he has n't planned to run . Though the spring air is cool , he wears no shirt . In the blackened houses an occasional dog snort/es as Garp passes by . Fresh from lovemaking , Garp imagines that his scent is as keen as a cut strawberry . He knows the dogs can smell him . These are well-policed suburbs and for a moment Garp is apprehensivethat he might be caught  --  in violation of some unwritten dress code , at least guilty of carrying no identification . He hurries , convinced he 's coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ralph . A young woman on an unlighted bicycle almost collides with him , her hair floating behind her , her knees bare and shiny , her breath striking Garp as a startling mixture of a fresh-cut lawn and cigarettes . Garp crouches  --  she cries out and wobbles her bike around him ; she stands up on her pedals and pumps fast away from him , not looking back . Perhaps she thinks he is a would-be exhibitionist  --  there with his torso and legs bare , ready to drop his shorts . Garp thinks she is coming from some place she should n't have been ; she is headed for trouble , he imagines . But , thinking of Duncan and Mrs. Ralph , Garp has trouble on his mind at this hour . When Garp first sees Ralph 's house , he believes it should be given the Light of the Block award ; every window is glaring , the front door is open , the cancerous television is violently loud . Garp suspects Mrs. Ralph is having a party , but as he creeps closer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he feels the house is deserted . The television 's lethal rays pulsate through the living room , clogged with piles of shoes and clothes ; and crammed against the sagging couch are the casual bodies of Duncan and Ralph , half in their sleeping bags , asleep ( of course ) , but looking as if the television has murdered them . In the sickly TV light their faces look drained of blood . But where is Mrs. Ralph ? Out for the evening ? Gone to bed with all the lights on and the door open , leaving the boys to be bathed by the television ? Garp wonders if she 's remembered to shut the oven off . The living room is pockmarked with ashtrays ; Garp fears for cigarettes still smoldering . He stays behind the hedges and slinks to the kitchen window , sniffing for gas . There is a litter of dishes in the sink , a bottle of gin on the kitchen table , the sour smell of slashed limes . The cord to the overhead light , at one time too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip of a woman 's pair of panty hose  --  severed up the middle , the whereaboutsof the other half unclear . The nylon foot , spotted with translucent stains of grease , dangles in the breeze above the gin . There is nothing burningthat Garp can smell , unless there 's a slow fire under the cat , who lies neatly on top of the stove , artfully spread between burners , its chin resting on the handle of a heavy skillet , its furry belly warmed by the pilot lights . Garp and the cat stare at each other . The cat blinks.  |p201But  Garp believes that Mrs. Ralph has n't the necessary concentration to turn herself into a cat . Her home  --  her life  --  in utter disarray , the woman appears to have abandoned ship , or perhaps passed out upstairs . Is she in bed ? Or in the bathtub , drowned ? And where is the beast whose dangerous droppings have made a mine field out of the lawn ? Just then there is a thunderous approach down the back staircase of a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen , startling the cat into flight , skidding the greasy iron skillet to the floor . Mrs. Ralph sits bare-assed and wincing on the linoleum , a kimonostylerobe wide open and roughly tugged above her thick waist , a miraculouslyunspilled drink in her hand . She looks at the drink , surprised , and sips it ; her large , down-pointing breasts shine  --  they slouch across her freckled chest as she leans back on her elbows and burps . The cat , in a corner of the kitchen , yowls at her , complaining . " Oh , shut up , Titsy , " Mrs. Ralph says to the cat . But when she tries to get up , she groans and lies down flat on her back . Her pubic hair is wet and glistens at Garp ; her belly , furrowed with stretch marks , looks as white and parboiled as if Mrs. Ralph has been underwater for a long time . " I 'll get you out of here if it 's the last thing I do , " Mrs. Ralph tells the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . Perhaps she 's broken an ankle and is too drunk to feel it , Garp thinks ; perhaps she 's broken her back . Garp glides alongside the house to the open front door . He calls inside . " Anybody home ? " he shouts . The cat bolts between his legs and is gone outside . Garp waits . He hears grunts from the kitchen  --  the strange sounds of flesh slipping . " Well , as I live and breathe , " says Mrs. Ralph , veering into the doorway , her robe of faded flowers more or less drawn together ; somewhere , she 's ditched her drink . " I saw all the lights on and thought there might be trouble , " Garp mumbles . " You 're too late , " Mrs. Ralph tells him . " Both boys are dead . I should never have let them play with that bomb . " She probes Garp 's unchangingface for any signs of a sense of humor there , but she finds him rather humorless on this subject . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pulls him toward her by the elastic waistband of his running shorts . Garp , aware he 's not wearing a jock , stumbles quickly after his pants , bumping into Mrs. Ralph , who lets him go with a snap and wanders into the living room . Her odor confuses him  --  like vanilla spilled in the bottom of a deep , damp paper bag . Mrs. Ralph seizes Duncan under his arms and with astonishing strength lifts him in his sleeping bag to the mountainous , lumpy couch ; Garp helps her lift Ralph , who 's heavier . They arrange the boys , foot to foot on thep202couch , tucking their sleeping bags around them and setting pillows under their heads . Garp turns off the TV and Mrs. Ralph stumbles through the room , killing lights , gathering ashtrays . They are like a married couple , cleaning up after a party . " Night-y night ! " Mrs. Ralph whispers to the suddenly dark living room , as Garp trips over a hassock , groping his way toward the kitchen lights . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " You 've got to help me get someone out of here . " She takes his arm , drops an ashtray ; her kimono opens wide . Garp , bending to pick up the ashtray , brushes one of her breasts with his hair . " I 've got this lummox up in my bedroom , " she tells Garp , " and he wo n't go . I ca n't make him leave . " " A lummox ? " Garp says . " He 's a real oaf , " says Mrs. Ralph , " a fucking wingding . " " A wingding ? " Garp says . " Yes , please make him go , " she asks Garp . She pulls out the elastic waistband of his shorts again , and this time she takes an unconcealed look . " God , you do n't wear too much , do you ? " she asks him . " Are n't you cold ? " She lays her hand flat on his bare stomach . " No , you 're not , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is he ? " Garp asks , fearing he might get involved in evicting Mrs. Ralph 's former husband from the house . " Come on , I 'll show you , " she whispers . She draws him up the back staircase through a narrow channel that passes between the piled laundry and enormous sacks of pet food . No wonder she fell down here , he thinks . In Mrs. Ralph '  --  s bedroom Garp looks immediately at the sprawled black Labrador retriever on Mrs. Ralph 's undulating water bed . The dog rolls listlessly on his side and thumps his tail . Mrs. Ralph mates with her dog , Garp thinks , and she ca n't get him out of her bed . " Come on , boy , " Garp says . " Get out of here . " The dog thumps his tail harder and pees a little . " Not him , " Mrs. Ralph says , giving Garp a terrific shove ; he catches his balance on the bed , which sloshes . The great dog licks his face . Mrs. Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , but Garp first sees the young man reflected in Mrs. Ralph 's dressing-table mirror . Sitting naked in the chair , he is combing out the blond end of his thin ponytail , which he holds over his shoulder and sprays with one of Mrs. Ralph 's aerosol cans . His belly and thighs have the same slick buttered look that Garp saw on the flesh and fur of Mrs. Ralph , and his young cock is as lean and arched as the backbone of a whippet . " Hey , how you doing ? " the kid says to Garp . " Fine , thank you , " Garp says . " Get rid of him , " says Mrs. Ralph . " I 've been trying to get her to just relax , you know ? " the kid asks Garp . " I 'm trying to get her to just sort of go with it , you know ? "  | " Do n't let him talk to you , " Mrs. Ralph says . " He 'll bore the shit out of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells Garp ; he turns in the chair , leans back , and puts his feet on the water bed ; the dog licks his long toes . Mrs. Ralph kicks his legs off the bed . " You see what I mean ? " the kid asks Garp . " She wants you to leave , " Garp says . " You her husband ? " the kid asks . " That 's right , " says Mrs. Ralph , " and he 'll pull your scrawny little prick off if you do n't get out of here . " " You better go , " Garp tells him . " I 'll help you find your clothes . " The kid shuts his eyes , appears to meditate . " He 's really great at that shit , " Mrs. Ralph tells Garp . " All this kid 's good for is shutting his damn eyes . " " Where are your clothes ? " Garp asks the boy . Perhaps he 's seventeen or eighteen , Garp thinks . Maybe he 's old enough for college , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes him by the shoulder . " Do n't touch me , man , " the boy says , eyes still closed . There is somethingfoolishly threatening in his voice that makes Garp draw back and look at Mrs. Ralph . She shrugs . " That 's what he said to me , too , " she says . Like her smiles , Garp notices , Mrs. Ralph 's shrugs are instinctual and sincere . Garp grabs the boy 's ponytail and tugs it across his throat and around to the back of his neck ; he snaps the boy 's head into the cradle of his arm and holds him tightly there . The kid 's eyes open . " Get your clothes , okay ? " Garp tells him . " Do n't touch me , " the boy repeats . " I am touching you , " Garp says . " Okay , okay , " says the boy . Garp lets him get up . The boy is several inches taller than Garp , but easily ten pounds lighter . He looks for his clothes but Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with brocade . The boy climbs into it like armor . " It was nice balling you , " he tells Mrs. Ralph , " but you should learn to relax more . " Mrs. Ralph laughs so harshly that the dog stops wagging his tail . " You should go back to day one , " she tells the kid , " and learn everythingall over again , from the beginning . " She stretches out on the water bed beside the Labrador , who lolls his head across her stomach . " Oh , cut it out , Bill ! " she tells the dog crossly . " She 's very unrelaxed , " the kid informs Garp . " You do n't know shit about how to relax anybody , " Mrs. Ralph says . Garp steers the young man out of the room and down the treacherous hack staircase , through the kitchen to the open front door.  | " You know , she asked me in , " the boy explains . " It was her idea . " " She asked you to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're as unrelaxed as she is , " the boy tells him . " Did the children know what was up ? " Garp asks him . " Were they asleep when you two went upstairs ? " " Do n't worry about the kids , " the boy says . " Kids are beautiful , man . And they know much more than grownups think they know . Kids are just perfect people until grownups get their hands on them . The kids were just fine . Kids are always just fine . " " You have kids ? " Garp ca n't help but mutter ; until now Garp has felt great patience toward the young man , but Garp is n't patient on the subject of children . He accepts no other authority there . " Good-bye , " Garp tells the boy . " And do n't come back . " He shoves him , but lightly , out the open door . " Do n't push me ! " the kid shouts , but Garp ducks under the punch and comes up with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feels that the kid weighs seventy-five , maybe eighty pounds , though of course he 's heavier than that . He bear-hugs the boy and pins his arms behind his back ; then he carries him out to the sidewalk . When the kid stops struggling , Garp puts him down . " You know where to go ? " Garp asks him . " Do u need any directions ? " The kid breathes deeply , feels his ribs . " And do n't tell your friends where they can come sniffing around after it , " Garp says . " Do n't even use the phone . " " I do n't even know her name , man , " the kid whines . " And do n't call me man ' again , " says Garp . " Okay , man , " the kid says . Garp feels a pleasant dryness in His throat , which he recognizes as his readiness to touch someone , but he lets the feelingpass . " Please walk away from here , " Garp says . A block away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garp knows how quickly he could run him down ; anticipation of such a comedy appeals to him , but it would be disappointing if the boy were n't scared and Garp feels no pressing need to hurt him . Garp waves good-bye . The boy raises his middle finger and walks away , his silly robe dragging  --  an early Christian lost in the suburbs . Look out for the lions , kid , Garp thinks , sending a blessing of protectionafter the boy . In a few years , he knows , Duncan will be that age ; Garp can only hope that he 'll find it easier to communicate with Duncan . Back inside , Mrs. Ralph is crying . Garp hears her talking to the dog . " Oh , Bill , " she sobs . " I 'm sorry I abuse you , Bill . You 're so nice . " " Good-bye ! " Garp calls up the stairs . " Your friend 's gone , and I'mgoing too . "  | " Chickenshit ! " yells Mrs. Ralph . " How can you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , Garp thinks , the dog will start to bay . " What can I do ? " Garp calls up the stairs . " You could at least stay and talk to me ! " Mrs. Ralph shouts . " You goody-goody chickenshit wingding ! " What 's a wingding ? Garp wonders , navigating the stairs . " You probably think this happens to me all the time , " says Mrs. Ralph , in utter rumplement upon the water bed . She sits with her legs crossed , her kimono tight around her , Bill 's large head in her lap . Garp , in fact , does think so , but he shakes his head . " I do n't get my rocks off by humiliating myself , you know , " Mrs. Ralph says . " For God 's sake , sit down . " She pulls Garp to the rocking bed . " There 's not enough water in the damn thing , " Mrs. Ralph explains . " My husband used to fill it all the time , because it leaks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage-counsel man . " I hope you never walk out on your wife , " Mrs. Ralph tells Garp . She takes his hand and holds it in her lap ; the dog licks his fingers . " It 's the shittiest thing a man can do , " says Mrs. Ralph . " He just told me he 'd been faking his interest in me , for years ' ! he said . And then he said that almost any other woman , young or old , looked better to him than I did . That 's not very nice , is it ? " Mrs. Ralph asks Garp . " No , it is n't , " Garp agrees . " Please believe me , I never messed around with anyone until he left me , " Mrs. Ralph tells him . " I believe you , " Garp says . " It 's very hard on a woman 's confidence , " Mrs. Ralph says . " Why should n't I try to have some fun ? " " You should , " Garp says . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confesses , holding her hands to her eyes , rocking on the bed . The dog tries to lick her face but Garp pushes him away ; the dog thinks Garp is playing with him and lunges across Mrs. Ralph 's lap . Garp whacks the dog 's nose  --  too hard  --  and the poor beast whines and slinks away . " Do n't you hurt Bill ! " Mrs. Ralph shouts . " I was just trying to help you , " Garp says . " You do n't help me by hurting Bill , " Mrs. Ralph says . " Jesus , is everyonebananas ? " Garp slumps back on the water bed , eyes shut tight ; the bed rolls like a small sea , and Garp groans . " I do n't know how to help you , " he confesses . " I 'm very sorry about your troubles , but there 's really nothing I can do , is there ? If you want to tell me anything , go ahead , " he says , his eyes still shut tight , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a cheerful thing to say to someone , " Mrs. Ralph says . Bill is breathing in Garp 's hair . There is a tentative lick at his ear . Garp wonders :  |p206Is  it Bill or Mrs. Ralph ? Then he feels her hand grab him under his track shorts , and he thinks , coldly : If I did n't really want her to do that , why did I lie down on my back ? " Please do n't do that , " he says . She can certainly feel he 's not interested , and she lets him go . She lies down beside him , then rolls away , putting her back to him . The bed sloshes violently as Bill tries to wriggle between them , but Mrs. Ralph elbows him so hard in his thick rib cage that the dog coughs and abandons the bed for the floor . " Poor Bill . I 'm sorry , " Mrs. Ralph says , crying softly . Bill 's hard tail thumps the floor . Mrs. Ralph , as if to complete her self-humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of rain Garp knows can last all day . Garp , the marriage counselor , wonders what could give the woman a little confidence . " Mrs. Ralph ? " Garp says  --  then tries to bite back w - t he 's said . " What ? " she says . " What 'd you say ? " She struggles up to her elbows and turns her head to glare at him . She heard him , he knows . " Did you say Mrs. Ralph ' ? " she asks him . " Jesus , Mrs. Ralph ' ! " she cries . " You do n't even know my name ! " Garp sits up on the edge of the bed ; he feels like joining Bill on the floor . " I find you very attractive , " he mumbles to Mrs. Ralph , put he 's facing Bill . " Really I do . " I " Prove it , " Mrs. Ralph says . " You goddamn liar . Show me . " " I ca n't show you , " Garp says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you attractive . " " I do n't even give you an erection ! " Mrs. Ralph shouts . " Here I am half-naked , and when you 're beside me  --  on my goddamn bed  --  you do n't even have a respectable hard-on . " " I was trying to conceal it from you , " Garp says . " You succeeded , " Mrs. Ralph says . " What 's my name ? " Garp feels he has never been so aware of one of his terrible weaknesses : how he needs to have people like him , how he wants to be appreciated . With every word , he knows , he is deeper in trouble , and deeper into an obvious lie . Now he knows what a wingding is . " Your husband must be crazy , " Garp says . " You look better to me than most women . " " Oh , please stop it , " says Mrs. Ralph . " You must be sick . " I must be , Garp agrees , but be says , " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important , you should develop confidence in yourself in other ways . " " There never were any other ways , " Mrs. Ralph admits . " I was never so hot at anything but sex , and now I 'm not so hot at sex either . " " But you 're going to school , " Garp says , groping.  | " I 'm sure I do n't know why , " Mrs. Ralph says . " Or is that what you mean by developing confidence in other ways ? " Garp squints hard , wishes for unconsciousness ; when he hears the water bed sound like surf , he senses danger and opens his eyes . Mrs. Ralph has undressed , has spread herself out on the bed naked . The little waves are still lapping under her roughtoughbody , which confronts Garp like a sturdy rowboat moored on choppy water . " Show me you 've got a hard-on and you can go , " she says . " Show me your hard-on and I 'll believe you like me . " Garp tries to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts his eyes and thinks of someone else . " You bastard , " says Mrs. Ralph , but Garp discovers he is already hard ; it was not nearly so difficult as he imagined . Opening his eyes , he 's forced to recognize that Mrs. Ralph is not without allure . He pulls down his track shorts and shows himself to her . The gesture itself makes him harder ; he , finds himself liking her damp , curly hair . But Mrs. Ralph seems neither disappointed nor impressed with the demonstration ; she is resigned to being let down . She shrugs . She rolls over and turns her great round rump to Garp . " Okay , so you can actually get it up , " she tells him . " Thank you . You can go home now . " Garp feels like touching her . Sickened with embarrassment , Garp feels he could come by just looking at her . He blunders out the door , down the wretched staircase . Is the woman 's self-abuse all over for this night ? he wonders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforting light of dawn . Stepping on the fallen skillet and clanging it against the stove , he hears not even a sigh from Mrs. Ralph and only a moan from Bill . If the boys were to wake up and need anything , he fears Mrs. Ralph would n't hear them . It 's 3:30 A.M. in Mrs. Ralph 's finally quiet house when Garp decides to clean the kitchen , to kill the time until dawn . Familiar with a housewife 's tasks , Garp fills the sink and starts to wash the dishes . When the phone rang , Garp knew it was Helen . It suddenly occurred to him  --  all the terrible things she could have on her mind . " Hello , " Garp said . " Would you tell me what 's going on , please ? " Helen asked . Garp knew she had been awake a long time . It was four o'clock in the morning . " Nothing 's going on , Helen , " Garp said . " There was a little trouble here , and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? " Helen asked . " In bed , " Garp admitted . " She passed out . "  | " From what ? " Helen asked . " She 'd been drinking , " Garp said . " There was a young man here , with her , and she wanted me to get him to leave . " " So then you were alone with her ? " Helen asked . " Not for long , " Garp said . " She fell asleep . " " I do n't imagine it would take very long , " Helen said , " with her . " Garp let there be silence . He had not experienced Helen 's jealousyfor a while , but he had no trouble remembering its surprising sharpness . " Nothing 's going on , Helen , " Garp said . " Tell me what you 're doing , exactly , at this moment , " Hel%n said . " I 'm washing the dishes , " Garp told her . He heard her tak , a long , controlled breath . " I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't want to leave Duncan , " Garp told her . " I think you should bring Duncan home , " Helen said . " Right now . " " Helen , " Garp said . " I 've been good . " It sounded defensive , even to Garp ; also , he knew he had n't been quite good enough . " Nothing has happened , " he added , feeling a little more sure of the truth of that . " I wo n't ask you why you 're washing her filthy dishes , " Helen sad . " To pass the time , " Garp said . But in truth he had not examined what he was doing , until now , and it seemed pointless to him  --  waiting for dawn , as if accidents only happened when it was dark . " I 'm waiting for Duncan to wake up , " he said , but as soon as he spoke he felt there was no sense to that , either . " Why not just wake him up ? " Helen asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garp said , trying to introduce some levity . " I know all the things you 're good at , " Helen told him , a little too bitterly to pass as a joke . " You 'll make yourself sick , thinking like this , " Garp said . " Helen , really , please stop it . I have n't done anything wrong . " But Garp had a puritan 's niggling memory of the hard-on Mrs. Ralph had given him . " I 've already made myself sick , " Helen said , but her voice softened . " Please come home now , " she told him . " And leave Duncan ? " " For Christ 's sake , wake him up ! " she said . " Or carry him . " " I 'll be right home , " Garp told her . " Please do n't worry , do n't think what you 're thinking . I 'll tell you everything that happened . You 'll probablylove this story . " But he knew he would have trouble telling her all this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the parts to leave out . " I feel better , " Helen said . " I 'll see you , soon . Please do n't wash anotherdish . " Then she hung up and Garp reviewed the kitchen . He thoughtp209that his half hour of work had n't made enough of a difference for Mrs. Ralph to notice that any effort to approach the debris had even been begun . Garp sought Duncan 's clothes among the many , forbidding clots of clothing flung about the living room . He knew Duncan 's clothes but he could n't spot them anywhere ; then he remembered that Duncan , like a hamster , stored things in the bottom of his sleeping bag and crawled into the nest with them . Duncan weighed about eighty pounds , plus the bag , plus his junk , but Garp believed he could carry the child home ; Duncan could retrieve his bicycle another day . At least , Garp decided , he would not wake Duncan up inside Ralph 's house . There might be a scene ; Duncan would be fussy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garp thought of Mrs. Ralph . Furious at himself , he knew he wanted one last look ; his sudden , recurring erection reminded him that he wanted to see her thick , crude body again . He moved quickly to the back staircase . He could have found her fetid room with his nose . He looked straight at her crotch , her strangely twisted navel , her rather small nipples ( for such big breasts ) . He should have looked first at her eyes ; then he might have realized she was wide-awake and staring back at him . " Dishes all done ? " asked Mrs. Ralph . " Come to say good-bye ? " " I wanted to see if you were all right , " he told her . " Bullshit , " she said . " You wanted another look . " " Yes , " he confessed ; he looked away . " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't be , " she said . " It 's made my day . " Garp tried to smile . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What a sorry man you are . Except to your wife , " Mrs. Ralph said . " You never once said you were sorry to her . " There was a phone beside the water bed . Garp felt he had never so badly misread a person 's condition as he had misread Mrs. Ralph 's . She was suddenly no drunker than Bill ; or she had become miraculously undrunk , or she was enjoying that half hour of clarity between stupor and hangover  --  a half hour Garp had read about , but had always believed was a myth . Another illusion . " I 'm taking Duncan home , " Garp told her . She nodded . " If I were you , " she said , " I 'd take him home , too . " Garp fought back another " I 'm sorry , " suppressing it after a short but serious struggle . " Do me one favor ? " said Mrs. Ralph . Garp looked at her ; she did n't mind . " Do n't tell your wife everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be such a pig . Maybe you could draw a picture of me with a little sympathy . " " I have pretty good sympathy , " Garp mumbled . " You have a pretty good rod on , too , " said Mrs. Ralph , staring atp210Garp 's elevated track shorts . " You better not bring that home . " Garp said nothing . Garp the puritan felt he deserved to take a few punches . " Your wife really looks after you , does n't she ? " said Mrs. Ralph . " I guess you have n't always been a good boy . You know what my husband would have called you ? " she asked . " My husband would have called you pussywhipped . ' " " Your husband must have been some asshole , " Garp said . It felt good to get a punch in , even a weak punch , but Garp felt foolish that he had mistaken this woman for a slob . Mrs. Ralph got off the bed and stood in front of Carp . Her tits touched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke her . " You 'll be back , " Mrs. Ralph said . " Want to bet on it ? " Gar left ' her without a word . He was n't farther than two blocks from Mrs. Ralph 's house  --  Duncan crammed down in the sleeping bag , wriggling over Garp 's shoulder  --  when the squad car pulled to the curb and its police-blue light Fickered over him where he stood caught . A furtive , half-naked kidnapper sneaking away with his bright bundle of stolen goods and stolen looks  --  and a stole I child . " What you got there , fella ? " a policeman asked him . There w-re two of them in the squad car , and a third person who was hard to see in the back seat . " My son , " Garp said . Both policemen got out of the car . " Where are you going with him ? " one of the cops asked Garp . " Is he all right ? " He shined a flashlight in Duncan 's face . Duncan was still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was spending the night at a friend 's house , " Garp said . " But it did n't work out . I 'm carrying him home . " The policeman shined his light over Garp  --  in his running costume . Shorts , shoes with racing stripes , no shirt.  --  You got identification ?  --  the policeman asked . Garp set Duncan and the sleeping bag , gently , on someone 's lawn . " Of course not , " Garp said . " If you give me a ride home , I 'll show you something . " The policemen looked at each other . They had been called into the neighborhood , hours ago , when a young woman had reported that she was approached by an exhibitionist  --  at least , by a streaker . Possibly it was a matter of attempted rape . She had escaped him on a bicycle , she said . " You been out here a long time ? " one of the policemen asked Garp . The third person , in the back seat of the police car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he saw Garp , he said , " Hey , man , how you doing ? " Duncan started to wake up . " Ralph ? " Duncan said.  |p211One  policeman knelt beside the boy and pointed the flashlight up at Garp . " Is this your father ? " the cop asked Duncan . The boy was rather wild-eyed ; he darted his eyes from his father to the cops to the blue light flashing on the squad car . The other policeman went over to the person in the back seat of the car . It was the boy in the purple caftan . The police had picked him up while they were cruising the neighborhood for the exhibitionist . The boy had n't been able to tell them where he lived  --  because he did n't really live anywhere . " Do you know that man with the child there ? " the policeman asked the boy . " Yeah , he 's a real tough guy , " the kid said . " It 's all right , Duncan , " Garp said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Son ? " the policeman asked Duncan . " Is this your father ? " " You 're scaring him , " Garp told the cop . " I 'm not scared , " Duncan said . " Why are you taking me home ? " he asked his father . It seemed that everyone wanted to hear this . " Ralph 's mother was upset , " Garp said ; he hoped that would be enough , but the rejected lover in the police car started to laugh . The policemanwith the flashlight shone his light on the lover boy and asked Garp if he knew him . Garp thought : There is no end to this in sight . " My name is Garp , " Garp said , irritably . " T. S. Garp . I am married . I have two children . One of them  --  this one , named Duncan , the older  --  was spending the night with a friend . I was convinced that this friend 's mother was unfit to look after my son . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still trying to get home . " That boy , " Garp said , pointing to the police car , " was visiting the mother of the friend of my son when I arrived . The mother wanted the boy to leave  --  that boy , " Garp said , again pointing at the kid in the police car , " and he left . " " What is this mother 's name ? " a policeman asked ; he was trying to write everything down in a giant pad . After a polite silence , the policeman looked up at Garp . " Duncan ? " Garp asked his son . " What is Ralph 's name ? " " Well , it 's being changed , " Duncan said . " He used to have his father 's name , but his mother 's trying to get it changed . " " Yes , but what is his father 's name ? " Garp asked . " Ralph , " Duncan said . Garp shut his eyes . " Ralph Ralph ? " the policeman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Garp said . " Ralph 's last name is what ? " " Well , I think that 's the name being changed , " Duncan said . " Duncan , what is it being changed from ? " Garp asked  | " You could ask Ralph , " Duncan suggested . Garp wanted to scream . " Did you say your name was Garp ? " one of the policemen asked . " Yes , " Garp admitted . " And the initials are T. S. ? " the policeman asked . Garp knew what would happen next ; he felt very tired . " Yes , T. S. , " he said . " Just T. S. " " Hey , Tough Shit ! " howled the kid in the car , falling back in the seat , swooning with laughter . " What does the first initial stand for , Mr. Garp ? " the policeman asked . " Nothing , " Garp said . " Nothing ? " the policeman said . " They 're just initials , " Garp said . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is T ? " the policeman asked . " People call me Garp , " Garp said . " What a story , man ! " cried the boy in the caftan , but te policeman nearest the squad car rapped on the roof at him . " You put your dirty feet on that seat again , sonny , " he said , " and I 'll have you licking the crud off . " " Garp ? " said the policeman interviewing Garp . " I know who you are ! " he cried suddenly . Garp felt very anxious . " You 're the one who got that molester in that park ! " " Yes ! " said Garp . " That was me . But it was n't here , and it was years ago . " " I remember it as if it were yesterday , " the policeman said . " What 's this ? " the other policeman asked . " You 're too young , " the cop told him . " This is the man named Garp who grabbed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child molester , that 's who it was . And what was it you did ? " he asked Garp , curiously . " I mean , there was something funny , was n't there ? " " Funny ? " said Garp . " For a living , " the policeman said . " What did you do for a living ? " " I 'm a writer , " Garp said . " Oh , yeah , " the policeman remembered . " Are you still a writer ? " " Yes , " Garp confessed . He knew , at least , that he was n't a marriage counselor . " Well , I 'll be , " the policeman said , but something was still bothering him ; Garp could tell something was wrong . " I had a beard then , " Garp offered . " That 's it ! " the policeman cried . " And you 've shaved it off ? " " Right , " said Garp . The policemen had a conference in the red glow of the taillights of the squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride home , but theyp213said Garp would still have to show them some information regarding his identity . " I just do n't recognize you  --  from the pictures  --  without the beard , " the older policeman said . " Well , it was years ago , " Garp said , sadly , " and in another town . " Garp felt uneasy that the young man in the caftan would get to see thehouse the Garps lived in . Garp imagined the young man would show upone day , asking for something . " You remember me ? " the kid asked Duncan . " I do n't think so , " Duncan said , politely . " Well , you were almost asleep , " the boy admitted . To Garp he said , " You 're too uptight about children , man . Children make it just fine . This your only child ? " " No , I have another one , " Garp said . " Man , you ought to have a dozen other ones , " the boy said . " Then maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? " This sounded to Garp like what his mother called the Percy Theory of Children . " Take your next left , " Garp told the policeman who was driving , " then a right , and it 's on the corner . " The other policeman handed Duncan a lollipop . " Thank you , " Duncan said . " What about me ? " the kid in the caftan asked . " I like lollipops . " The policeman glared ; when he turned his back , Duncan gave the kid his lollipop . Duncan was no fan of lollipops , he never had been . " Thank you , " the boy whispered . " You see , man ? " he said to Garp . " Kids are just beautiful . " So is Helen , Garp thought  --  in the doorway with the light behind her . Her blue , floor-length robe had a high , roll-up collar ; Helen had the collar turned up as if she were cold . She also had her glasses on , so that Garp knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered the kid in the caftan , elbowing Garp as he got out of the car . " What 's that lovely lady like when she gets her glasses off ? " " Mom ! We got arrested , " Duncan called to Helen . The squad car waited at the curb for Garp to get his identification . " We did not get arrested , " Garp said . " We got a ride , Duncan . Everything'sfine , " he said angrily , to Helen . He ran upstairs to find his wallet among his clothes . " Is that how you went out ? " Helen called after him . " Dressed like that ? " " The police thought he was kidnapping me , " Duncan said . " Did they come to the house ? " Helen asked him . " No , Dad was carrying me home , " Duncan said . " Boy , is Dad weird . "  |p214Gar|p  thundered down the stairs and ran out the door . " A case of mistaken identity , " Garp muttered to Helen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , do n't get upset . " " I 'm not upset , " Helen said , sharply . Garp showed the police his identification . " Well , I 'll be , " the older policeman said . " I is just T. S. , is n't it ? I suppose it 's easier that way . " " Sometimes it is n't , " Garp said . As the police car was leaving , the kid called out to Garp , " You 're not a bad guy , man , if you 'd just learn to relax ! " Garp 's impression of Helen 's body , lean and tense and shivering in the blue robe , did not relax him . Duncan was wide-awake and jabbering ; he was hungry , too . So was Garp . In the predawn kitchen , Helen coolly watched them eat . Duncan told the plot of a long TV/ movie ; Garp suspected that it was actually two movies , and Duncan hd fallen asleep beforeone was over and woken up after the other one had begun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted into Duncan 's movies . Helen did n't ask any questions . In part , Garp knew , this was because there was nothing she could say in front of Duncan . But in part , like Garp , she was severely editing what she wanted to say . They were both grateful for Duncan 's presence ; by the time they got to speak freely to each other , the long wait might make them kinder , and more careful . At dawn they could n't wait any longer and they began to talk to each other through Duncan . " Tell Mommy what the kitchen looked like , " Garp said . " And tell her about the dog . " " Bill ? " " Right ! " Garp said . " Tell her about old Bill . " " What was Ralph 's mother wearing while you were there ? " Helen asked Duncan . She smiled at Garp . " I hope she wore more clothes than Daddy . " " What did you have for supper ? " Garp asked Duncan . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or both ? " Garp tried to give her a look that said : Please do n't get started . He could feel her edging the old , worn weapons into easy reach . She had a babysitteror two she could recall for him , and he felt her moving the babysittersinto place . If she brought up one of the old , wounding names , Garp had no names ready for retaliation . Helen had no baby-sitters against her ; not yet . In Garp 's mind , Harrison Fletcher did n't count . " How many telephones are there ? " Helen asked Duncan . " Is there a phone in the kitchen and one in the bedroom ? Or is the only phone in the bedroom ? "  |p215When  Duncan finally went to his room , Helen and Garp were left with less than half an hour before Walt would wake up . But Helen had the names of her enemies ready . There is plenty of time to do damage when you know where the war wounds are . " I love you so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p216LATE-NIGHT  phone calls  --  those burglar alarms in the heart  --  would frighten Garp all his life . Who is it that I love ? Garp 's heart would cry , at the first ring  --  who 's been blasted by a truck , who 's drowned in the beer or lies sideswiped by an elephant in the terrible darkness ? Garp feared the receiving of such after-midnight calls , but he once made one  --  unknowingly  --  himself . It had been one evening when Jenny was visiting them ; his mother had let it slip how Cushie Percy had ruptured in childbirth . Garp had not heard of it , and although he occasionally joked with Helen about his old passion for Cushie  --  and Helen teased him about her  --  the news of Cushie dead was nearly crippling to Garp . Cushman Percy had been so active  --  there had been such a hot juiciness about her  --  it seemed impossible . News of an accident to Alice Fletcher could not have upset him more ; he felt more prepared for something happening to her . Sadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice . Garp wandered into the kitchen and without really noticing the time , or remembering when he opened another beer , he discovered that he had dialed the Percys ' number ; the phone was ringing . Slowly , Garp could imagine the long way back from sleep that Fat Stew had to travel before he could answer the phone . " God , who are you calling ? " Helen asked , coming into the kitchen . " It 's quarter of two ! " Before Garp could hang up , Stewart Percy answered the phone . " Yes ? " Fat Stew asked , worriedly , and Garp could imagine frail and brainless Midge sitting up in bed beside him , as nervous as a cornered hen . " I 'm sorry I woke you , " Garp said . " I did n't realize it was so late . " Helen shook her head and walked abruptly out of the kitchen . Jenny appeared in the kitchen doorway ; on her face was the kind of critical lookp217only a mother can give a Son . That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who the hell is this ? " Stewart Percy said . " This is Garp , sir , " Garp said , a little boy again , apologizing for his genes . " Holy shit , " said Fat Stew . " What do you want ? " Jenny had neglected to tell Garp that Cushie Percy had died months ago ; Garp thought he was offering condolences on a fresh disaster . Thus he faltered . " I 'm sorry , very sorry , " Garp said . " You said so , you said so , " Stewart said . " I just heard about it , " Garp said , " and I wanted to tell you and Mrs. Percy how truly sorry I was . I may not have demonstrated it , to you , sir , but I was really very fond of  --  " " You little swine ! " said Stewart Percy . " You mother humper , you Jap ball of shit ! " He hung up the phone . Even Garp was unprepared for this much loathing . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances of his phone call . Poor Pooh Percy , batty Bainbridge , would one day explain it to Jenny . When Garp called , Cushie had been dead for so long that Stewart did not realize Garp was commiserating with him on Cushie 's loss . When Garp called , it was the midnight of the dark day when the black beast , Bonkers , had finally expired . Stewart Percy thought that Garp 's call was a cruel joke  --  false condolences for the dog Garp had always hated . And now , when Garp 's phone rang , Garp was conscious of Helen 's grip emerging instinctively from her sleep . When he picked up the phone , Helen had his leg clamped fast between her knees  --  as if she were holding tight to the life and safety that his body was to her . Garp 's mind ran through the odds . Walt was home asleep . And so was Duncan ; he was not at Ralph 's . Helen thought : It is my father ; it 's his heart . Sometimes she thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morgue . And Garp thought : They have murdered Mom . Or they are holding her for ransom  --  men who will accept nothing less than the public rape of forty virgins before releasing the famous feminist , unharmed . And they 'll also demand the lives of my children , and so forth . It was Roberta Muldoon on the phone , and that only convinced Garp that the victim was Jenny Fields . But the victim was Roberta . " He 's left me , " Roberta said , her huge voice swollen with tears . " He 's thrown me over . Me ! Can you believe it ? " " Jesus , Roberta , " Garp said . " Oh , I never knew what shits men were until I became a woman , " Roberta said.  | " It 's Roberta , " Garp whispered to Helen , so that she could relax . " Her lover 's flown the coop . " Helen sighed , released Oup 's leg , rolled over . " You do n't even care , do you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Garp said . " I 'm sorry , " Roberta said . " But I thought it was too late to call your mother . " Garp found this logic astonishing , since he knew that Jenny stayed up later than he did ; but he also liked Roberta , ve much , and she had certainly had a hard time . " He said I was n't enough of a woman , that I confused him , sexually  --  that I was confused sexually ! " Roberta cried . " Oh , God , that prick . All he wanted was the novelty of it . He was just showing off for his friends . " " I 'll bet you could have taken him , Roberta , " Garp said . " Why did n't you beat the shit out of him ? " " You do n't understand , " Roberta said . " I do n't feel like beating the shit out of anyone , anymore . I 'm a woman ! " " Do n't women ever feel like beating the shit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and pulled his cock . " I do n't know what women feel like , " Roberta wailed . " I do n't knowwhat they 're supposed to feel like , anyway . Ujust know what I feel like . " " What 's that ? " Garp asked , knowing she wanted to tell him . " I feel like beating the shit out of him now , " Roberta confessed , " butwhen he was dumping all over me , I just sat there and took it . I even cried . I 've been crying all day ! " she cried , " and he even called me up and told me that if I was still crying I was faking myself . " " The hell with him , " Garp said . " All he wanted was a great big lay , " Roberta said . " Why are men like that ? " " Well , " Garp said . " Oh , I know you 're not , " Roberta said . " I 'm not even attractive to you , probably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garp said . " But not to you , " Roberta said . " Do n't lie . I 'm not sexually attractive , am IT ' " Not really to me , " Garp confessed , " but to lots of other men , yes . Of course you are . " " Well , you 're a good friend , that 's more important , " Roberta said . " You 're not really sexually attractive to me , either . " " That 's perfectly all right , " Garp said . " You 're too short , " Roberta said . " I like longer-looking people  --  I mean , sexually . Do n't be hurt . " " I 'm not hurt , " Garp said . " Do n't you be , either . " " Of course not , " Roberta said.  | " Why not call me in the morning , " Garp suggested . " You 'll feel better . " " I wo n't , " Roberta said , sulkily . " I 'll feel worse . And I 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to your doctor ? " Garp said . " The urologist ? The fellow who did your operation  --  he 's your friend , is n't he ? " " I think he wants to - fuck me , " Roberta said , seriously . " I think that 's all he ever wanted to do to me . I think he recommended this whole operationjust because he wanted to seduce me , but he wanted to make me a woman first . They 're notorious for that  --  a friend was telling me . " " A crazy friend , Roberta , " Garp said . " Who 's notorious for that ? " " Urologists , " Roberta said . " Oh , I do n't know  --  is n't urology a little creepy to you ? " It was , but Garp did n't want to upset Roberta any further . " Call Mom , " he heard himself say . " She 'll cheer you up , she 'll think of something . " " Oh , she is wonderful , " Roberta sobbed . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've used her for so much . " " She loves to help , Roberta , " Garp said , and knew it was , at least , the truth . Jenny Fields was full of sympathy and patience , and Garp only wanted to sleep . " A good game of squash might help , Roberta , " Garp suggested , weakly . " Why not come over for a few days and we 'll really hit the ball around . " Helen rolled into him , frowned at him , and bit his nipple ; Helen liked Roberta , but in the early phase of her sex reassignment Roberta could talk only about herself . " I just feel so drained , " Roberta said . " No energy , no nothing . I do n't even know if I could play . " " Well , you should try , Roberta , " Garp said . " You should make yourselfdo something . " Helen , exasperated with him , rolled away from him . But Helen was affectionate with Garp when he answered these latenightcalls ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one to find out what the calls were about . It was strange , therefore , that when Roberta Muldoon called a second time , a few weeks later , Helen was the one who answered the phone . It surprised Garp because the phone was on his side of the bed and Helen had to reach over him to pick it up ; in fact , this time , she lunged across him and whispered quickly to the phone , " Yes , what is it ? " When she heard it was Roberta , she passed the phone quickly to Garp ; it was not as if she 'd been trying to let him sleep . And when Roberta called a third time , Garp felt an absence when he picked up the phone . Something was missing . " Oh , hello , Roberta , " Garp said . It was Helen 's usual grip on his leg : it was n't there . Helen was n't there , he noticed . He talked reassuringly to Roberta , felt the cold side of his unshared bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite hour . Wlien Roberta finally hung up , Garp went downstairs to look for Helen ,  |p220finding  her all alone on the living-room couch , sitting up with a glass of wine and a manuscript in her lap . " Could n't sleep , " she said , but there was a look on her face  --  it was a look Garp could n't immediately place . Although he thought he recognizedthat look , he also thought he had never seen that look on Helen . " Reading papers ? " he asked ; she nodded , but there was only one manuscript in front of her . Garp picked it up . " It 's just student work , " she said , reaching for it . The student 's name was Michael Milton . Garp read a paragraph of the paper . " It sounds like a story , " Garp said . " I did n't know you assigned fiction writing to your students . " " I do n't , " Helen said , " but they sometimes show me what they do , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer 's style was self-conscious and forced , but there were no errors on the page ; it was , at least , competent writing . " He 's one of my graduate students , " Helen said . " He 's very bright , but . . . " She shrugged , but her gesture hadthe sudden mock casualness of an embarrassed child . " But what ? " Garp said . He laughed  --  that Helen could look so girlish at this late hour . But Helen took her glasses off and showed him that other look again , that look he had first seen and could n't place . Anxiously , she said , " Oh , I do n't know . Young , maybe . He 's just young , you know . Very bright , but young . " Garp flipped a page , read half of another paragraph , gave the manuscriptback to her . He shrugged . " It 's all shit to me , " he said . " No , it 's not shit , " Helen said , seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announced he was going back to bed . " I 'll be up in a little while , " Helen told him . Then Garp saw himself in the mirror in the upstairs bathroom . That was where he finally identified that look he 'd seen , strangely out of place , on Helen 's face . It was a look Garp recognized because he 'd seen it before  --  on his own face , from time to time , but never on Helen 's . The look Garp recognized was guilty , and it puzzled him . He lay awake a long time but Helen did not come up to bed . In the morning Garp was surprised that although he 'd only glanced at the graduate student 's manuscript , the name of Michael Milton was the first thing to come to his mind . He looked cautiously at Helen , now lying awake beside him . " Michael Milton , " Garp said quietly , not to her , but loud enough for her to hear . He watched her unresponding face . Either she was daydreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him . Or , he thought , the name of Michael Milton was already on her mind , so that when Garp ut/tered it , it was the name that she was already saying  --  to herself  --  and she had not noticed that Garp had spoken it . Michael Milton , a third-year graduate student in comparative literature , had been a French major at Yale , where he graduated with indifferent distinction ; he had earlier graduated from the Steering School , though he tended to play down his prep school years . Once he knew that you knew lie had gone to Yale , he tended to play that down , too , but he never played down his Junior Year Abroad  --  in France , To listen to Michael Milton , you would not guess that he 'd spent only a year in Europe because he managed to give you the impression that he 'd lived in France all his young life . lie was twenty-five . Though he 'd lived so briefly in Europe , it appeared that he 'd bought all the clothes for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flared cuffs , and both the jackets and the slacks were cut to flatter the hips and the waist ; they were the kind of clothes that even the Americans of Carp 's days at Steering referred to as " Continental . " The collars of Michael Milton 's shirts , which he wore open at the throat ( always with two unbuttonedbuttons ) , were floppy and wide with a kind of Renaissance flair : a manner betraying both carelessness and intense perfection . He was as different from Garp as an ostrich is different from a seal . The body of Michael Milton was an elegant body , when dressed ; unclothed , he resembled no animal so much as he resembled a heron . He was thin and tallish , with a slouch his tailored tweed jackets concealed . He had a body like coat hangers  --  the perfect body to hang clothes on . Stripped , he had barely a body at all . He was Garp 's opposite in almost every way , except that Michael Milton had in common with Garp a tremendous self-confidence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of arrogance . Like Garp , he was aggressivein the way only someone who believes totally in himself can be aggressive . It had been these qualities , long ago , that had first attracted Helen to Garp . Now here were the qualities , newly attired ; they manifested them-%elves in a much different form , yet Helen recognized them . She was not usually attracted to rather dandified young men who dressed and spoke as if Ihey had grown world-weary and wisely sad in Europe , when , in fact , they had spent most of their short lives in the back seats of cars in Connecticut . But , in her girlhood , Helen had not usually been attracted to wrestlers , ritlier . Helen liked confident men , provided that their confidence was not absurdly misplaced . What attracted Michael Milton to Helen was what attracted many men and few women to her . She was , in her thirties , an alluring woman notp222simply because she was beautiful but because she was perfect-looking . It is an important distinction to note that she looked not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that she had good reason to have done so . This frightening but fetching look , in Helen 's case , was not misleading . She was a very successful woman . She looked to be in such total possession of her life that only the most confident men could continue to look at her if she looked back at them . Even in bus stations , she was a woman who was stared at only until she looked back . In the corridors surrounding the English Department , Helen was not used to being stared at at all ; everyone looked when they could , but the looks were furtive . She was , therefore , unprepared for the long , frank look that young Michael Milton gave her one day . He simply stopped in the hall and watched her walking toward him . It was actually Helen who turned her eyes away from his ; he turned and watched her walk away from him , down the hall . He said to someone beside him , loud enough for Helen to hear : " Does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , anyway ? " Michael Milton asked . In the second semester of that year , Helen taught a course in Narrative Point of View ; it was a seminar for graduate students , and for a few advancedundergraduates . Helen was interested in the development and sophisticationof narrative technique , with special attention to point of view , in the modern novel . In the first class she noticed the older-looking student with the thin , pale mustache and the nice shirt with the two buttons unbuttoned ; she turned her eyes away from him and distributed a questionnaire . It asked , among other questions , why the students thought they were interested in this particular course . In answer to that question , a student named Michael Milton wrote : " Because , from the first time I saw you , I wanted to be your lover . " After that class , alone in her office , Helen read that answer to her questionnaire . She thought she knew which one of the people in the class Michael Milton was ; if she 'd known it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would have shown the questionnaire to Garp . Garp might have said , " Show me the fucker ! " Or : " Let 's introduce him to Roberta Muldoon . " And they would both have laughed , and Garp would have teased her about leading her students on . Because the intentions of the boy , whoever he was , would have been aired between them , there would have been no possibility of actual connection ; Helen knew that . When she did n't show the questionnaire to Garp , she felt already guilty  --  but she thought that if Michael Milton was who she thought he was , she would like to see this go a little further . At that moment , in her office , Helen honestly did not foresee it going more than a little further . What would have been the harm of a little ? If Harrison Fletcher had still been her colleague , she would havep223shown him the questionnaire . Regardless  --  whoever Michael Milton was , even if he was that disturbing-looking boy  --  she would have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past , had some secrets of this kind , which they kept from Garp and Alice ; they were permanent but innocent secrets . Helen knew that sharing Michael Milton 's interest in her with Harrison would have been another way to avoid any actual connection . But she did not mention Michael Milton to Garp , and Harrison , of course , had left to seek his tenure elsewhere . The handwriting on the questionnairewas black , eighteenth-century calligraphy , the kind that can only be carved with a special pen ; Michael Milton 's written message looked more permanent than print , and Helen read it over and over again . She noted the other answers to the questionnaire : date of birth , years in school , previous courses in the Department of English or in comparative literature . She checked his transcript ; his grades were good . She called two colleagues who 'd had Michael Milton in courses last semester ; she derived from them both that Michael Milton was a good student , aggressive and proud to the point of being vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually say so , that Michael Milton was both gifted and unlikable . She thought of the deliberately unbuttoned buttons on his shirt ( she was , pure , now , that it was he ) and she imagined buttoning them up . She thought of that wispy mustache , a thin trace upon his lip . Garp would later comment on Michael Milton 's mustache , saying that it was an insult to the world of hair and to the world of lips ; Garp thought that it was so much the merest imitation of a mustache that Michael Milton would do his face a favor to shave it off . But Helen liked the strange little mustache on the lip of Michael Milton . " You just do n't like any mustaches , " Helen said to Garp . " I do n't like that mustache , " he said . " I 've got nothing against mustaches , in general , " Garp insisted , though in truth Helen was right : Garp Dated all mustaches , ever since his encounter with the Mustache Kid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helen also liked the length of Michael Milton 's sideburns , curly and hlondish ; Garp 's sideburns were cropped level to his dark eyes , almost at the tops of his ears  --  although his hair was thick and shaggy , and always just long enough to cover the ear that Bonkers ate . Helen also noticed that her husband 's eccentricities were beginning to bother her . Perhaps she just noticed them more , now that he was so fitfully involved in his writing slump ; when he was writing , perhaps he had less time to devote to his eccentricities ? Whatever the reason , she found them irksome . His driveway trick , for example , infuriated her ; it was even contradictory . For someone who fussed and worried so much about the safetyp224of the children  --  about reckless drivers , about leaking gas , and so forth  --  Garp had a way of entering their driveway and garage , after dark , that terrified Helen . The driveway turned sharply uphill off a long downhill road . When Garp knew the children were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and coast up the black driveway ; he would gather enough momentumfrom leaving the downhill road to roll over the lip at the top of the driveway and down into their dark garage . He said he did it so that the engine and the headlights would not wake up the children . But he had to start the car to turn it around to drive the baby-sitter home , anyway ; Helen said his trick was simply for a thrill  --  it was puerile and dangerous . He was always running over toys left in the blackened driveway , and crashinginto bicycles not moved far enough to the rear of the garage . Once a baby-sitter had complained to Helen that she hated coasting down the driveway with the engine and the headlights out ( another trick : he would pop the clutch and snap on the lights just before they reached the road ) . Am I the one who 's restless ? Helen wondered . She had not thought of herself as restless until she thought of Garp 's restlessness . And for how long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She did n't know . She only knew that she noticed she was irritated by them almost from the moment she read Michael Milton 's questionnaire . Helen was driving to her office , wondering what she would say to the rude and conceited boy , when the gear knob of the Volvo 's stick shift came off in her hand  --  the exposed shaft scratched her wrist . She swore as she pulled the car over and examined the damage to herself and to the gearshift . The knob had been falling off for weeks , the screw threads were stripped , and Garp had several times attempted to make the knob stay on the stick-shift shaft with tape . Helen had complained about this half-assed method of repair , but Garp never claimed to be handy and the care of the car was one of Helen 's domestic responsibilities . This division of labor , though largely agreed upon , was sometimes confusing . Although Garp was the homemaker among them , Helen did the ironing ( " because , " Garp said , " it 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the car serviced ( " because , " Garp said , " you 're the one who drives it every day ; you know best when something has to be fixed " ) . Helen accepted the ironing , but she felt that Garp should deal with the car . She did not like accepting a ride in the service truck from the garage to her office  --  sitting in the greasy cab with some young mechanic who paid less than adequate attention to his driving . The garage where the car was fixedp225was a friendly enough place to Helen , but she resented having to be there at all ; and the comedy of who would drive her to work after she dropped off the car had finally worn thin . " Who 's free to take Mrs. Garp to the university ? " the boss mechanic would cry into the dank and oily darkness of the vehicle pits . And three or four boys , eager but begrimed , would drop their wrenches and their needle-nosed pliers , would lug and heave themselves out of the pits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief , heady moment  --  that tight cab aclank with auto parts , which would take the slender Professor Garp to work . Garp pointed out to Helen that when he took the car , the volunteers were slow to appear ; he frequently waited in the garage for an hour , finally coaxing some laggard to drive him home . His morning 's work thus shot , he decided the Volvo was Helen 's chore . They had both procrastinated about the gearshift knob . " If you just call to order a new one , " Helen told him , " I 'll drive there and let them screw it on while I wait . But I do n't want to leave the car for a day while they fart around trying to fix this one . " She had tossed the knob to him , but he 'd carried it out to the car and had taped it , recd ariousjy , back on the shaft . Somehow , she thought , it always fell off when she was driving ; but , of course , she drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and drove to her office with the bare , ugly gearshift uncovered . It hurt her hand every time she had to shift the car , and her scratched wrist bled a little on the fresh skirt of her suit . She parked the car and carried the gear knob with her , across the parking lot , toward her office building . She contemplated throwing it down a storm sewer , but it had little numbers printed on it ; in her office she could call the garage and tell them what the little numbers were . Then she could throw it away , wherever she liked ; or , she thought , I can mail it to Garp . It was in this mood , beset with trivia , that Helen encountered the smug  --  young man slouched in the hall by her office door with the top two buttons of his nice shirt unbuttoned . The shoulders of his tweed jacket were , she noticed , slightly padded ; his hair was a bit too lank , and too long , and one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooped too far down at the corner of his mouth . She was not sure if she wanted to love this young man or groom him . " You 're up early , " she told him , handing him the gearshift knob so that she could unlock her office door . " Have you hurt yourself ? " he asked . " You 're bleeding . " Helen would think later that it was as if he had a nose for blood , because the slight wratch on her wrist had almost stopped bleeding . " Are you going to be a doctor ? " she asked him , letting him inside her office.  | " I was going to be , " he said . " What stopped you ? " she asked , still not looking at him , but moving about her desk , straightening what was straight already ; and adjusting the venetian blind , which had been left exactly as she wanted it . She took her glasses off , so that when she looked at him he was soft and fuzzy . " Organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the course . And besides , I wanted to live in France . " " Oh , you 've lived in France ? " Helen asked him , knowing that 's what she was supposed to ask him , knowing it was one of the things he thought was special about himself , and he did n't hesitate to slip it in . He had even slipped it in the questionnaire . He was very shallow , she saw right away ; she hoped he was the slightest bit intelligent , but she felt curiously relieved by his shallowness  --  as if this made him less dangerous to her , and left her a little freer . They talked about France , which was fun for Helen , because she talked about France as well as Michael Milton talked about it , and she had never been to Europe . She also told him that she thought he had a poor reason for taking her course . " A poor reason ? " he pressed her , smiling . " First of all , " Helen said , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , you already have a lover ? " Michael Milton asked her , still smiling . Somehow he was so frivolous that he did n't insult her ; she did n't snap at him that it was enough to have a husband , that it was none of his business , or that she was out of his league . She said , instead , that for what he wanted he should at least have registered for independent study . He said he 'd be glad to switch courses . She said she never took on any new independentstudy students in the second semester . She knew she had not entirely discouraged him , but she had not been exactly encouraging , either . Michael Milton talked to her , seriously , for an hour  --  about the subject of her course in narration . He discussed Virginia Woolf 's The Waves and Jacob 's Room very impressively , though he was not so good on To the Lighthouse and Helen knew he only pretended to have read Mrs. Dalloway . When he left , she was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton previously : he was glib , he was smug , he was facile , and all that was unlikable ; but he had a certain brittle smartness , however shiny and thin it was  --  and it was also , somehow , unlikable . What her colleagues had overlooked was his pious smile and his way of wearing clothes as if he were defiantly undressed . But Helen 's colleagues were men ; they could not have been expected to define the precise audacity of Michael Milton 's smile the way Helen could define it . Helen recognized it as a smile that said to her : Ip227already know you , and I know everything you like . It was an infuriating smile , but it tempted her ; she wanted to wipe it off his face . One way of wiping it off , Helen knew , would be to show Michael Milton that he did n't know her  --  or what she really liked  --  at all . She also knew that not too many ways of showing him were open to her . When she first shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncoveredstick-shift shaft dug sharply into the heel of her hand . She knew exactly where Michael Milton had left the gear knob  --  on the window ledge above the wastebasket , where the janitor would find it and probably throw it away . It looked as if it ought to be thrown away , but Helen remembered that she had not phoned in the little numbers to the car garage . That would mean that she , or Garp , would have to call the ear garage and try to order a new knob without the goddamn numbers  --  giving the year and model of the car , and so forth , and inevitably ending up with a knob that was n't right . But Helen decided she was not going back to her office , and she had enough on her mind already without trying to remember to call the janitor and tell him not to throw away the knob . Besides , it might already be too late . And anyway , Helen thought , it 's not just my fault . It 's Garp 's fault , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fault . It 's just one of those things . But she did not quite feel guiltless ; not yet . When Michael Milton gave tier his papers to read  --  his old papers , from his other courses  --  she accepted them and read them , because at least this was an allowable , stillinnocentsubject for them to discuss : his work . When he grew bolder , and more attached to her , and he showed her even his creative work , his short stories and pathetic poems about France , Helen still felt that their long conversations were guided by the critical , constructive relationship between a student and a teacher . It was all right to have lunch together ; they had his work to talk about . Perhaps both of them knew that the work was not so special . For Michael Milton , any topic of conversation that justified his being with Helen was all right . For Helen , she was still anxious about the obvious conclusion  --  when he simply ran out of work ; when they had consumed all the papers he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every book they had-in common . Then Helen knew they would need a new subject . She also knew that this was only her problem  --  that Michael Milton alreadyknew what the inevitable subject between them was . She knew he was smugly and irritatingly waiting for her to make up her mind ; she occasionallywondered if he would be bold enough to raise his original answer to her questionnaire again , but she did n't think so . Perhaps both of themp228knew that he would n't have to  --  that the next move was hers . He would show her how grown-up he was by being patient . Helen wanted , above all , to surprise him . But among these feelings that were new to her , there was one she disliked ; she was most unused to feeling guilty  --  for Helen Holm always felt right about everything she did , and she needed to feel guiltless about this , too . She felt close to achieving this guilt-free state of mind , but she did not quite have it ; not yet . It would be Garp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed he had competition ; Garp got started as a writer out of a sense of competition , and he finally broke out of his writing slump with a similar , competitive surge . Helen , he knew , was reading someone else . It did not occur to Garp that she might be contemplating more than literature , but he saw with a typical writer 's jealousy that someone else 's words were keeping her up at night . Garp had first courted Helen with " The Pension Grillparzer . " Some instinct told him to court her again . If that had been an acceptable motive to get a young writer started , it was a dubious motive for his writing now  --  especially after he 'd been stopped for so long . He might have been in a necessary phase , rethinking everything , letting the well refill , preparing a book for the future with a proper period of silence . Somehow the new story he wrote for Helen reflected the forced and unnatural circumstances of its conception . The story was written less out of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to relieve the anxieties of the writer . tItwas possibly a necessary exercise for a writer who had not written in too long , but Helen did not care for the urgency with which Garp shoved the story at her . " I finally finished something , " he said . It was after dinner ; the children were asleep ; Helen wanted to go to bed with him  --  she wanted long and reassuring lovemaking , because she had come to the end of what Michael Milton had written ; there was nothing more for her to read , or for them to talk about . She knew she should not show the slightest disappointment in the manuscript Garp gave her , but her tiredness overwhelmed her and she stared at it , crouching between dirty dishes . " I 'll do the dishes alone , " Garp offered , clearing the way to his story for her . Her heart sank ; she had read too much . Sex , or at least romance , was the subject she had at last come to ; Garp had better provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be loved , " Helen told Garp ; he was gathering up the dishes like a waiter who was : onfident of a large tip . He laughed at her . " Read the story , Helen , " he said . " Then we 'll get laid . " She resented his priorities . There could be no comparison between Garp 's writing and the student work of Michael Milton ; though giftedp229among students , Michael Milton , Helen knew , would only be a student of writing all his life . The issue was not writing . The issue is me , Helen thought ; I want someone paying attention to me . Garp 's manner of courtshipwas suddenly offensive to her . The subject being courted was somehow Garp 's writing . That is not the subject between us , Helen thought . Because of Michael Milton , Helen was way ahead of Garp at considering the spoken and unspoken subjects between people . " If people only told each other what was on their minds , " wrote Jenny Fields  --  a naive but forgivable lapse ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to do that . Garp cautiously washed the dishes , waiting for Helen to read his story . Instinctively  --  the trained teacher  --  Helen took out her red pencil and began . That is not how she should read my story , Garp thought ; I 'm not one of her students . But he went on quietly washing the dishes . He saw there was no stopping her . Running my five miles a day , I frequently encounter some smartmouthedmotorist who will pull alongside me and ask ( from the safety of the driver 's seat ) , " What are you in training for ? " Deep and regular breathing is the secret ; I am rarely out of breath ; I never pant or gasp when I respond . " I am staying in shape to chase cars , " I say . At this point the responses of the motorists vary ; there are degrees of stupidity as there are degrees of everything else . Of course , they never realize that I do n't mean them  --  I 'm not staying in shapo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , at least . I let them go out there , though I sometimes believe that I could catch them . And I do not run on the open road , as some motorists believe , to attract attention . In my neighborhood there is no place to run . One must leave the suburbs to be even a middle-distance runner . Where I live there are four-way stop signs at every intersection ; the blocks are short , and those right-angle corners are hard on the balls of the feet . Also , the sidewalks are threatened by dogs , festooned with the playthings of children , interinittentlysplashed with lawn sprinklers . And just when there 's some running room , there 's an elderly person taking up the whole sidewalk , precarious on crutches or armed with quacking canes . With good conscience one does not yell " Track ! " to such a person . Even passing the aged at a safe distance , but with my usual speed , seems to alarm them ; and it 's not my intention to cause heart attacks.  |p230So  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs I 'm in training for . In my condition I am more than a match for a car caught speeding in my neighborhood . Provided they make an even halfhearted halt at the stop signs , they can not hit over fifty before they have to brake for the next intersection . I always catch up to them . I can travel across lawns , over porches , through swing sets and the children 's wading pools ; I can burst through hedges , or hurdle them . And since my engine is quiet  --  and steady , and always in tune  --  I can hear if other cars are coming ; 1 do n't have to stop at the stop signs . In the end I run them down , I wave them over ; they always stop . Although I am clearly in impressive car-chasing condition , that is not what intimidates the speeders . No , they are almost always intimidated by my parenthood , because they are almost always young . Yes , my parenthood is what sobers them , almost every time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " I ask them , loudly and anxiously . Veteran speeders , upon being asked such a question , are immediately frightened that they have run over my children . They are instantly defensive . " I have two young children , " I tell them . The drama is deliberate in my voice  --  which , with this sentence , I allow to tremble a little . It is as if I am holding back tears , or unspeakable rage , or both . Perhaps they think I am hunting a kidnapper , or that I suspect them of being child molesters . " What happened ? " they invariably ask . " You did n't see my children , did you ? " I repeat . " A little boy pullinga little girl in a red wagon ? " This is , of course , a fiction . I have two boys , and they 're not so little ; they have no wagon . They may have been watching television at the time , or riding their bikes in the park  --  where it 's safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the bewildered speeder says . " I saw children , some children . But I do n't think I saw those children . Why ? " " Because you almost killed them , " I say . " But I did n't see them ! " the speeder protests . " You were driving too fast to see them ! " I say . This is sprung on them as if it were proof of their guilt ; I always pronounce this sentence as if it were hard evidence . And they 're never sure . I 've rehearsed this part so well . The sweat from my hard sprint , by now , drips off my mustache and the point of my chin , streaking the driver's-side door . They know only a father who genuinely fears for his children would run so hard , would stare like such a maniac , would wear such a cruel mustache . " I 'm sorry , " they usually say . " This is a neighborhood full of children , " I always tell them . " Youp231have other places you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children 's sake , do n't speed here anymore . " My voice , now , is never nasty ; it is always beseeching . But they see that a restrained fanatic resides behindmy honest , watering eyes . Usually it 's just a young kid . Those kids have a need to dribble a little oil ; they want to race the frantic pace of the music on their radios . And I do n't expect to change their ways . I only hope they 'll do it somewhereelse . I concede that the open road is theirs ; when I train there , I keep my place . I run in the stuff of the soft shoulder , in the hot sand and gravel , in the beer-bottle glass  --  among the mangled cats , the maimed birds , the mashed condoms . But in my neighborhood , the car is not king ; not yet . Usually they learn . After my five-mile run I do fifty-five push-ups , then five hundredyarddashes , followed by fifty-five situps , followed by fifty-five neck bridges . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's simply that strenuous and mindless exertion is easier if one does n't have to keep track of too many different numbers . After my shower ( about five o'clock ) , through the late afternoon , and in the course of the evening , I allow myself five beers . I do not chase cars at night . Children should not be playing outside at night  --  in my neighborhood , or in any other neighborhood . At night , I believe , the car is king of the whole modern world . Even the suburbs . At night , in fact , I rarely leave my house , or allow the members of my family to venture out . But once I went to investigate an obvious accident  --  thedarkness suddenly streaked with headlights pointing straight up and exploding ; the silence pierced with a metal screaming and the shriek of ground glass . Only half a block away , in the dark and perfect middle of my street , a Land Rover lay upside-down and bleeding its oil and gas in a puddle so deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sound : the ping of heat in the hot pipes and the dead engine . The Land Rover looked like a tank tumbled by a land mine . Great juts and tears in the pavement revealed that the auto had rolled over and over before coming to rest here . The driver's-side door could be opened only slightly , but enough to miraculously turn on the door light . There in the lit cab , still behind the steering wheel  --  still upside-down and still alive  --  was a fat man . He looked unharmed . The top of his head rested gingerly on the ceiling of the cab , which of course was now the floor , but the man seemed only dimly sensitive to this change in his perspective . He looked puzzled , chiefly , by the presence of a large brown bowling ball that sat alongside his head , like another head ; he was , in fact , cheek to cheek with this bowling ball , which he perhaps felt touching him as he might havep232felt the presence of a lover 's severed head  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roger ? " the man asked . I could n't tell whether he was addressing me or the bowling ball . " It is not Roger , " I said , answering for us both . " That Roger is a moron , " the man explained . " We crossed our balls . " That the fat man was referring to a bizarre sexual experience seemed unlikely . I assumed that the fat man referred to bowling . " This is Roger 's ball , " he explained , indicating the brown globe against his cheek . " I should have known it was n't my ball because it would n't fit in my bag . My ball will fit in anyone 's bag , but Roger 's ball is really strange . I was trying to fit it in my bag when the Land Rover went off the bridge . " Although I knew there was no bridge in my entire neighborhood , I tried to visualize the occurrence . But Iwas distracted by the gurgle of spilling gasoline , like beer down a thirstyman 's throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside-down bowler . " I 'll wait for Roger , " he replied . " Roger will be right along . " And sure enough , along came another Land Rover , as if they were a separated twosome from a column of an army on the move . Roger 's Land Rover came along with its headlights out and did not stop in time ; it plowed into the fat bowler 's Land Rover and together , like coupled boxcars , they jarred each other another tough ten yards down the street . It appeared that Roger was a moron , but I merely asked him the expected question : " Is that you , Roger ? " " Yup , " said the man , whose throbbing Land Rover was dark and creaking ; little fragments of its windshield and headlights and grille dropped to the street like noisy confetti . " That could only be Roger ! " groaned the fat bowler , still upsidedown  --  andstill alive  --  in his lit cab . I saw that his nose bled slightly ; it appeared that the bowling ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he called out . " You 've got my ball ! " " Well , someone 's got my ball , then , " Roger replied . " I 've got your ball , you moron , " the fat bowler declared . " Well , that 's not the answer to everything , " Roger said . " You 've got my Land Rover . " Roger lit a cigarette in the blackened cab ; he did not appear interested in climbing out of the wreck . " You should set up flares , " I suggested to him , " and that fat man should get out of your Land Rover . There 's gasoline everywhere . I do n't think you should smoke . " But Roger only continued smoking and ignoringme in the cavelike silence of the second Land Rover , and the fatp233bowler again cried out  --  as if he were having a dream that was starting over , at the beginning  --  " Is that you , Roger ? " I went back to my house and called the police . In the daytime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such mayhem , but people who go bowling in each other 's Land Rovers are not the usual suburbanspeeders , and I decided they were legitimately lost . " Hello , Police ? " I said . I have learned what you can and what you ca n't expect of the police . I know that they do not really support the notion of citizen arrest ; when I have reported speeders to them , the results have been disappointing . They do n't seem interested in learning the details . I am told there are people whom the police are interested in apprehending , but I believe the police are basically sympathetic to speeders ; and they do not appreciate citizens who make arrests for them . I reported the whereabouts of the bowlers ' accident , and when the police asked , as they always ask , who was calling , I told them , " Roger . " That , I knew  --  knowing the police  --  would be interesting . The police are always more interested in bothering the person who reports the crime than they are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arrived , they went straight after Roger . I could see them all arguing under the streetlamps , but I could catch only snatches of their conversation . " He 's Roger , " the fat bowler kept saying . " He 's Roger through and through . " " I 'm not the Roger who called you fuckers , " Roger told the police . " That 's true , " the fat bowler declared . " This Roger would n't call the police for anything . " And after awhile they began to call out into our dark suburb for another Roger . " Is there another Roger here ? " one policeman called . Roger ! " screamed the fat bowler , but my dark house and the dark houses of my neighbors were appropriately silent . In daylight , I knew , they would all be gone . Only their oil slicks and their broken glass would remain . Relieved  --  and , as always , pleased with the destruction of automotivevehicles  --  I watched until almost dawn , when the hulking , coupled Land Rovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two exhausted rhinos caught fornicating in the suburbs . Roger and the fat bowler stood arguing , and swinging their bowling balls , until the streetlamps in our block were extinguished ; then , as if on signal , the bowlers shook hands and departed in different directions  --  on foot , and as if they knew where they were going . The police came interrogating in the morning , still concerned withp234the possibility of another Roger . But they learned nothing from me  --  just as they learn nothing , apparently , whenever I report a speeder to them . " Well , if it happens again , " they tell me , " be sure to let us know . " Fortunately , I have rarely needed the police ; I am usually effective with first offenders . Only once have I had to stop the same driver  --  and him , only twice . He was an arrogant young man in a blood-red plumber 's truck . Lurid-yellow lettering advertised on the cab that the plumber handled Roto-Rootering needs and all plumbing services : 0 . FECTEAU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point . " I 'm calling the cops , " I told the young man . " And I 'm calling your boss , old O. Fecteau ; I should have coed him the last time . " " I 'm my own boss , " the young man said . " It 's my plumbing business . Fuck off . " And I realized 1 was facing O. Fecteau himself a runty but successfulyouth , unimpressed with standard authority . " There are children in this neighborhood , " I said . " Two of them are mine . " " Yeah , you already told me , " the plumber said ; he revved his engineas if he were clearing his throat . There was a hint of menace in his expression , like the trace of pubic beard he was growing on his young chin . I rested my hands on the door  --  one on the handle , one on the rolled-down window . " Please do n't speed here , " I said . " Yeah , I 'll try , " said O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the plumber lit a cigarette and smiled at me . I thought I saw on hispunk 's face the leer of the world . " If I catch you driving like that again , " I said , " I 'll stick your RotoRooterup your ass . " We stared at each other , O. Fecteau and I. Then the plumber gunned his engine and popped his clutch ; I had to leap back to the curb . In the gutter I saw a little metal dump truck , a child 's toy ; the front wheels were missing . I snatched it up and ran after O. Fecteau . Five blocks later I was close enough to throw the dump truck , which struck the plumber 's cab ; it made a good noise but it bounced off harmlessly . Even so , O. Fecteauslammed on his brakes ; about five long pipes were flipped out of the pickup part of the truck , and one of those metal drawers sprang open , disgorging a screwdriver and several spools of heavy wire . The plumber jumped down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a Stillsonwrench in his hand . You could tell he was sensitive about collecting dents on his blood-red truck . I grabbed one of the fallen pipes . It wasp235about five feet long and I quickly smashed the truck 's left taillight with it . For some time now , things have just been coming naturally to me in fives . For example , the circumference , in inches , of my chest ( expanded ) : fifty-five . " Your taillight 's broken , " I pointed out to the plumber . " You should n't be driving around that way . " " I 'm going to call the cops on you , you crazy bastard ! " said O. Fecteau . " This is a citizen arrest , " I said . " You broke the speed limit , you 're endangering the lives of my children . We 'll go see the cops together . " And I poked the long pipe under the truck 's rear license plate and folded the plate like a letter . " You touch my truck again , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the pipe felt as light in my hands as a badminton racket ; I swung it easily and shattered the other taillight . " You 're already in trouble , " I pointed out to O. Fecteau . " You ever drive in this neighborhood again , you better stay in first gear and use your flasher . " First , I knew ( swinging the pipe ) , he would need to repair his flasher . There was an elderly woman , just then , who came out of her house to observe the commotion . She recognized me immediately . I catch up to a lot of people at her corner . " Oh , good for you ! " she called . I smiled to her and she tottered toward me , stopping and peering into her wellgroomedlawn where the toy dump truck arrested her attention . She seized it , with obvious distaste , and carried it over to me . I put the toy and the pieces of broken glass and plastic from the taillights and the flasher into the back of the pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the open road , in training , I see nothing but litter . I put the other pipes in back , too , and with the long pipe I still held ( like a warrior'sjavelin ) I nudged the screwdriver and the spools of wire that had fallen by the curb . O. Fecteau gathered them up and returned them to the metal drawer . He is probably a better plumber than a driver , I thought ; the Stillson wrench looked very comfortable in his hand . " You should be ashamed of yourself , " the old woman told O. Fecteau . The plumber glared at her . " He 's one of the worst ones , " I told her . " Imagine that , " the old lady said . " And you 're a big boy , " she told the plumber . " You should know better . " 0 . Fecteau edged back to the cab , looking as if he would hurl his wrench at me , then leap into his truck and back over the old biddy . " Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely in the cab , I slid the long pipe into the pickup . Then I took the old woman 's arm and holped her along the sidewalk.  |p236When  the truck tore away from the curb , with that stink of scorched rubber and a noise as raw as bones leaving their sockets , I felt the old lady tremble through the frail point of her elbow ; something of her fear passed into me , and I realized how risky it was to make anyone as angry as I had made O. Fecteau . I could hear him , maybe five blocks away , driving furiously fast , and I prayed for all the dogs and cats and children who might be near the street . Surely , I thought , modern life is about five times as difficult as life used to be . I should stop this crusade against speeders , I thought . I go too far with them , but they make me so angry  --  with their carelessness , their dangerous , sloppy way of life , which I view as so directly threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have always hated cars , and hated people who drove them Mupidly . I feel such anger toward people who take such risks with other people 's lives . Let them race their cars  --  but in the desert ! We would not allow an outdoor rifle range in the suburbs ! Let them jump out of airplanes , if they want  --  but over the ocean ! Not where my children live . " What would this neighborhood be like without you ? " the old woman wondered aloud . I can never remember her name . Without me , I thought , this neighborhood would probably be peaceful . Perhaps deadlier , but peaceful . " They all drive so fast , " the old lady said . " If it were n't for you , I sometimes think they 'd be having their smashups right in my living room . " But I felt embarrassed that I shared such anxiety with eighty-year-olds  --  that my fears are more like their nervous , senile worriesthan they are the normal anxieties of people my own young middle age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aiming the old woman toward her front door , steering her over the cracks in the sidewalk . Then the plumber came back . I thought the old woman was going to die in my arms . The plumber drove over the curb and hurtled past us , over the old woman 's lawn , flattening a whiplike young tree and nearly rolling over when he wheeled the truck into a U-turn that uprooteda sizable hedge and tore divots from the ground the size of fivepoundsteaks . Then down to the sidewalk the truck fled  --  an explosion of tools flying free of the pickup as the rear wheels jounced over the curb . O. Fecteau was off up the street , once more terrorizing my neighborhood ; I saw the violent plumber jump the curb again at the corner of Dodge and Furlong  --  where he grazed the back of a parked car , springing open the car 's trunk on impact and leaving it flapping . Helping the shaken old lady inside , I called the police  --  and my wife , to tell her to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I help the neighborhood , I thought : I drive mad men madder . The old woman sat in a paisley chair in her cluttered living room ,  |p237as  carefully as a plant . When O. Fecteau returned  --  this time driving within inches of the living room bay window , and through the gravel beds for the baby trees , his horn blaring  --  the old woman never moved . I stood at the door , awaiting the ultimate assault , but I thought it wiser not to show myself . I knew that if O. Fecteau saw me , he would attempt to drive in the house . By the time the police arrived , the plumber had rolled his truck in an attempt to avoid a station wagon at the intersection of Cold Hill and North Lane . He had broken his collarbone and was sitting upright in the cab , though the truck lay on its side ; he was n't able to climb out the door above his head , or he had n't tried . O. Fecteau appeared calm ; he was listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provoke the offending drivers less ; if I sense them taking offense at my stopping them and presuming to criticize their vile habits , I simply tell them I am informing the police and quickly leave . That O. Fecteau turned out to have a long history of violent overreactionsto social situations did not allow me to forgive myself . " Look , it 's all the better you got that plumber off the road , " my wife told me  --  and she usually criticizes my meddlesomeness in the behavior of others . But I could only think that I had driven a workingman off his rocker , and that during his outburst , if O. Fecteau had killed a child , whose fault would it have been ? Partly mine , I think . In modern times , in my opinion , either everything is a moral questionor there are no more moral questions . Nowadays , there are no compromises or there are only compromises . Never influenced , I keep my vigil . There is no letting up . Do n't say anything , Helen told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him upstairs as fast as you can , and talk about the damn story later . Much later , she warned herself . But she knew he would n't let her . The dishes were done and he sat across the table from her . She tried her nicest smile and told him , " I want to go to bed with you . " " You do n't like it ? " he asked . " Let 's talk in bed , " she said . " Goddamn it , Helen , " he said . " It 's the first thing I 've finished in a long time . I want to know what you think of it . " She bit her lip and took her glasses off ; she had not made a single mark with her red pencil . " I love you , " she said . " Yes , yes , " he said , impatiently . " I love you , too , but we can fuck anytime . What about the story ? " And she finally relaxed ; she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought ; she felt hugely relieved.  | " Fuck the story , " she said . " No , I do n't like it . And I do n't want to talk about it , either . You do n't care to regard what 1 want , obviously . You 're like a little boy at the dinner table  --  you serve yourself first . " " You do n't like it ? " Garp said . " Oh , it 's not bad , " she said , " it 's just not much of anything . It 's a trifle , it 's a little ditty . If you 're warming up to something , I 'd like to see what it is  --  when you get to it . But this is nothing , you must know that . It 's a toss-off , is n't it ? You can do tricks like this with your left hand , ca n't you ? " " It 's funny , is n't it ? " Garp asked . " Oh , it 's funny , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all one-liners . I mean , what is it ? A self-parody ? You 're not old enough , and you have n't written enough , to start mocking yourself . It 's self-serving , it 's self-justifying ; and it 's not about anything except yourself , really . It 's cute . " " Son of a bitch , " said Garp . " Cute ? " " You 're always talking about people who write well but do n't have anything to say , " Helen said . " Well , what do you call this ? It 's no Grillparzer , ' certainly ; it is n't worth a fifth of what Grillparzer ' is worth . It is n't worth a tenth of that story , " Helen said . " The Pension Grillparzer ' is the first big thing I wrote , " Garp said . " This is completely different ; it 's another kind of fiction altogether . " " Yes , one is about something and one is about nothing , " Helen said . " One is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery and precision , and one has only wit . " When Helen 's critical faculties were engaged , they were difficult to disengage . " It 's not fair to compare them , " Garp said . " I know this is smaller . " " Then let 's not talk anymore about it , " Helen said . Garp sulked for a minute . " You did n't like Second Wind of the Cuckold , either , " he said , " and I do n't suppose you 'll like the next one any better . " " What next one ? " Helen asked him . " Are you writing another novel ? " He sulked some more . She hated him , making her do this to him , but she wanted him and she knew she loved him , too . " Please , " she said . " Let 's go to bed . " But now he saw his chance for a little cruelty  --  and/or a little truth  --  and his eyes shone at her brightly . " Let 's not say another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed . " " You think The Pension Grillparzer ' is the best thing I 've written , do n't you ? " he asked her . He knew already what she thought of the secondnovel , and he knew that , despite Helen 's fondness for Procrastination , afirst novel is a first novel . Yes , she did think " Grillparzer " was his best . " So far , yes , " she said , softly . " You 're a lovely writer , you know Ithink so . " " I guess I just have n't lived up to my potential , " Garp said , nastily.  | " You will , " she said ; the sympathy and her love for him were draining from her voice . They stared at each other ; Helen looked away . He started upstairs . " Are you coming to bed ? " he asked . His back was to her ; his intentions were hidden from her  --  his feelings for her , too : either hidden from her or buried in his infernal work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited on the stairs . " Got something to read ? " he asked . " No , I 'm through reading for a while , " she said . Garp went upstairs . When she came up to him , he was already asleep , which made her despair . If he 'd had her on his mind at all , how could he have fallen asleep ? But , actually , he 'd had so much on his mind , he 'd been confused ; he had fallen asleep because he was bewildered . If he 'd been able to focus his feelings on any one thing , he 'd still have been awake when she came upstairs . They might have saved a lot of things , then . As it was , she sat beside him on the bed and watched his face with more fondness than she thought she could stand . She saw he had a hard-on , as severe as if he had been waiting up for her , and she took him into her mouth and sucked him softly until he came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty-looking  --  when he appeared to realize where he was , and with whom . Helen , however , was not in the least guilty-looking ; she looked only sad . Garp would think , later , that it was as if Helen had known he had been dreaming of Mrs. Ralph . When he came back from the bathroom , she was asleep . She had quickly drifted off . Guiltless at last , Helen felt freed to have her dreams . Garp lay awake beside her , watching the astonishing innocence upon her face  --  until the children woke her.  |p240WHEN  Walt caught colds , Garp slept badly . It was as if he were trying to breathe for the boy , and for himself . Garp would get up in the night to kiss and nuzzle the child ; anyone seeing Garp would have thought that he could make Walt 's cold go away by catching it himself . " Oh , God , " Helen said . " It 's just a cold . Duncan had colds all winter when he was five . " Nearing eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at five , was fully in the throes of cold after cold  --  or it was one long cold that went away and came back . By the March mud season , Walt 's resistance struck Garp as altogether gone ; the child hacked himself and Garp awake each night with a wet , wrenching cough . Garp sometimes fell asleep listening to Walt 's chest , and he would wake up , frightened , when he could no longer hear the thump of the boy 's heart ; but the child had merely pushed his father 's heavy head off his chest so that he could roll over and sleep more comfortably . Both the doctor and Helen told Garp , " It 's just a cough . " But the imperfection in Walt 's nightly breathing scared Garp right out of his sleep . He was usually awake , therefore , when Roberta called ; the late-night anguish of the large and powerful Ms. Muldoon was no longer frightening to Garp  --  he had come to expect it  --  but Garp 's own fretful sleeplessness made Helen short-tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book , you 'd be too tired to lie awake half the night , " she said . It was his imagination that was keeping him up , Helen told him ; one sign that he had n't been writing enough , Garp knew , was when he had too much imagination left over for other things . For example , the onslaught of dreams : Garp now dreamed only of horrors happening to his children.  |p241In  a dream , there was one horror that took place while Garp was reading a pornographic magazine . He was just looking at the same picture , over and over again ; the picture was very pornographic . The wrestlers on the university team , with whom Garp occasionally worked out , had a peculiar vocabulary for such pictures . This vocabulary , Garp noted , had not changed since his days at Steering , when the wrestlers on Garp 's team spoke of such pictures in the same fashion . What had changed was the increased availability of the pictures , but the names were the same . The picture Garp looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rankings of pornographic pictures . Among pictures of naked women , there were names for how much you could see . If you could see the pubic hair , but not the sex parts , that was called a bush shot  --  or just a bush . If you could see the sex parts , which were sometimes partially hidden by the hair , that was a beaver ; a beaver was better than just a bush ; a beaver was the whole thing : the hair and the parts . If the parts were open , that was called a split beaver . And if the whole thing glistened , that was the best of all , in the world of pornography : that was a wet , split beaver . The wetnessimplied that the woman was not only naked and exposed and open , but she was also ready . In his dream , Garp was looking at what the wrestlers called a wet , split beaver when he heard children crying . He did not know whose children they were , but Helen and his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs and filed past him , where he struggled to hide from them what he 'd been looking at . They had been upstairs and something terrible had awakened them ; they were on their way farther downstairs  --  going to the basement as if the basement were a bomb shelter . And with that thought , Garp heard the dull crump of bombing  --  he noted the crumbling plaster , he saw the flickering lights  --  and he grasped the terror of what was approaching them . The children , two by two , marched whimpering after Helen and Jenny , who led them to the bomb shelter as soberly as nurses . If they looked at Garp at all , they regarded him with vague sadness and with scorn , as if he had let them all down and was powerless to help them now . Perhaps he had been looking at the wet , split beaver instead of watching for enemy planes ? This , true to the nature of dreams , was forever unclear : precisely why he felt so guilty , and why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the line of children were Walt and Duncan , holding liands ; the so-called buddy system , as it is employed at summer camps , appeared in Garp 's dream to be the natural reaction to a disaster among children . Little Walt was crying , the way Garp had heard him cry when lie was caught in the grip of a nightmare , unable to wake up . " I 'm havingp242a bad dream , " he sniveled . He looked at his father and almost shouted to him , " I 'm having a bad dream ! " But in Garp 's dream , Garp could not wake the child from this one . Duncan looked stoically over his shoulder at his father , a silent and bravely doomed expression on his beautiful young face . Duncan was appearing very grown-up lately . Duncan 's look was a secret between Duncan and Garp : that they both knew it was not a dream , and that Walt could not be helped . " Wake me up ! " Walt cried , but the long file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan 's grip ( Walt came to about the height of Duncan 's elbow ) , Walt looked back at his father . " I 'm having a dream ! " Walt screamed , as if to convince himself . Garp could do nothing ; he said nothing ; he made no attempt to follow them  --  down these last stairs . And the dropping plaster coated everything white . The bombs kept falling . " You 're having a dream ! " Garp screamed after little Walt . " It 's just a bad dream ! " be cried , though he knew he was lying . Then Helen would kick him and he 'd wake up . Perhaps Helen feared that Garp 's run-amuck imagination would turn away from Walt and turn on her . Because if Garp had given half the worry to Helen that he seemed compelled to give to Walt , Garp might have realized that something was going on . Helen thought she was in control of what was going on ; she at least had controlled how it began ( opening her office door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bidding him enter her room ) . Once inside , she closed the door behind him and kissed him quickly on the mouth , holding his slim neck so that he could n't even escape for breath , and grindingher knee between his legs ; he kicked over the wastebasket and dropped his notebook . " There 's nothing more to discuss , " Helen said , taking a breath . She raced her tongue across his upper lip ; Helen was trying to decide if she liked his mustache . She decided she liked it ; or , at least , she liked it for now . " We 'll go to your apartment . Nowhere else , " she told him . " It 's across the river , " he said . " I know where it is , " she said . " Is it clean ? " " Of course , " he said . " And it 's got a great view of the river . " " I do n't care about the view , " Helen said . " I want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I can clean it better . " " We can only use your car , " she said . " I do n't have a car , " he said . " I know you do n't , " Helen said . " You 'll have to get one . " He was smiling now ; he 'd been surprised , but now he was feeling sure of himself again . " Well , I do n't have to get one now , do IT ' he asked ,  |p243nuzzling  his mustache against her neck ; he touched her breasts . Helen unattachedherself from his embrace . " Get one whenever you want , " she said . " We 'll never use mine , and I wo n't be seen walking with you all over town , or riding on the buses . If anyone knows about this , it 's over . Do you understand ? " She sat down at her desk , and he did not feel invited to walk around her desk to touch her ; lie sat in the chair her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I love my husband and will never hurt him , " Helen told him . Michael Milton knew better than to smile . " I 'll get a car , right away , " he said . " And clean your apartment , or have it cleaned , " she said . " Absolutely , " he said . Now he dared to smile , a little . " What kind of car do you want me to get ? " he asked her . " I do n't care about that , " she told him . " Just get one that runs ; get one that is n't in the garage all the time . And do n't get one with bucket seats . Get one with a long seat in front . " He looked more surprised and puzzled than ever , so she explained to him : " I want to be able to lie down , comfortably , across the front seat , " she said . " I 'll put my head in your lap so that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? " " Do n't worry , " he said , smiling again . " It 's a small town , " Helen said . " No one must know . " " It 's not that small a town , " Michael Milton said , confidently . " Every town is a small town , " Helen said , " and this one is smaller than you think . Do you want me to tell you ? " " Tell me what ? " he asked her . " You 're sleeping with Margie Tallworth , " Helen said . " She 's in my Comp . Lit. 205 ; she 's a junior , " Helen said . " And you see another very young undergraduate  --  she 's in Dirkson 's English i5o ; I think she 's a freshman , but I do n't know if you 've slept with her . Not for lack of trying , if you have n't , " Helen added . " To my knowledge you 've not touched any of your fellow graduate students ; not yet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've missed , or there has been . " Michael Milton was both sheepish and proud at the same time , and the usual command he held over his expressions escaped him so completely that Helen did n't like the expression she saw on his face and she looked away . " That 's how small this town , and every town , is , " Helen said . " If you have me , " she told him , " you ca n't have any of those others . I know what young girls notice , and I know how much they 're inclined to say . " " Yes , " Michael Milton said ; he appeared ready to take notes . Helen suddenly thought of something , and she looked momentarily startled . " You do have a driver 's license ? " she asked  | " Oh yes ! " Michael Milton said . They both laughed , and Helen relaxed again ; but when he came around her desk to kiss her , she shook her head and waved him back . " And you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There will be nothing intimate in this office . I do n't lock I iy door . I do n't even like to have it shut . Please open it , now , " she asked him , and he did as he was told . He got a car , a huge Buick Roadmaster , the old kind of station wagon  --  with real wooden slats on the side . It was a 1951 Buick Dynaflow , heavy and shiny with pre-Korea chrome and real oak . It weighed 5,550 pounds , or almost three tons . It held seven quarts of oil and nineteen gallons of gasoline . Its original price was $2,85o but Michael Milton picked it up for less than six hundred dollars . " It 's a straight-eight cylinder , three-twenty cubic , power steering , with a single-throat Carter carb , " the salesman told Michael . " It 's not too badly rusted . " In fact , it was the dull , inconspicuous color of clotted blood , more than six feet wide and seventeen feet long . The front seat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost without having to bend her knees  --  or without having to put her head in Michael Milton 's lap , though she did this anyway . She did not put her head in his lap because she had to ; she liked her view of the dashboard , and being close to the old smell of the maroon leather of the big , slick seat . She put her head in his lap because she liked feeling Michael 's leg stiffen and relax , his thigh shifting just slightly between the brake and the accelerator . It was a quiet lap to put your head in because the car had no clutch ; the driver needed to move just one leg , and just occasionally . Michael Milton thoughtfully carried his loose change in his left front pocket , so there were only the soft wales of his corduroy slacks , which made a faint impression on the skin of Helen 's cheek  --  and sometimeshis rising erection would touch her ear , or reach up into the hair on the back of her neck . Sometimes she imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big car with the gaping chrome grille like the mouth of a feeding fish  --  Buick Eight in script across the teeth . But that , Helen knew , would not be safe . The first indication that the whole thing might not be safe was when Margie Tallworth dropped Helen 's Comp . Lit. 205 , without so much as a note of explanation concerning what she might not have liked about the course . Helen feared it was not the course that Margie had n't liked , and she called the young Miss Tallworth into her office to ask her for an explanation . Margie Tallworth , a junior , knew enough about school to know that no explanation was required ; up to a certain point in any semester , a stu/dent was free to drop any course without the instructor 's permission . " Do I have to have a reason ? " the girl asked Helen , sullenly . " No , you do n't , " Helen said . " But if you had a reason , I just wanted to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , " Margie Tallworth said . She held Helen 's gaze longer than most students could hold it ; then she got up to leave . She was pretty and small and rather well dressed for a student , Helen thought . If there was any consistency to Michael Milton 's former girl friend and his present taste , it appeared only that he liked women to wear nice clothes . " Well , I 'm sorry it did n't work out , " Helen said , truthfully , as Margie was leaving ; she was still fishing for what the girl might actually know . She knew , Helen thought , and quickly accused Michael . " You 've blown it already , " she told him coldly , because she could speak coldly to him  --  over the phone . " Just how did you drop Margie Tallworth ? " " Very gently , " Michael Milton said , smugly . " But a drop is a drop , no matter how different the ways of doing it are . " Helen did not appreciate it when he attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and he seemed to need to be dominant there . That was different for her , and she did n't really mind . He was sometimes rough , but not ever dangerous , she thought ; and if she firmly resisted something , he stopped . Once she had had to tell him , " No ! I do n't like that , I wo n't do that . " But she had added , " Please , " because she was n't that sure of him . He had stopped ; he had been forceful with her , but in another way  --  in a way that was all right with her . It was exciting that she could n't trust him completely . But not trusting him to be silent was another matter ; if she knew he had talked about her , that would be that . " I did n't tell her anything , " Michael insisted . " I said , Margie , it 's all over , ' or something like that . I did n't even tell her there was another woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she 's probably heard you talk about me , before , " Helen said . " Before this started , I mean . " " She never liked your course , anyway , " Michael said . " We did talk about that once . " " She never liked the course ? " Helen said . This truly surprised her . " Well , she 's not very bright , " Michael said , impatiently . " She 'd better not know , " Helen said . " I mean it : you better find out . " But he found out nothing . Margie Tallworth refused to speak to him . He tried to tell her , on the phone , that it was all because an old girl friend had come back to him  --  she had arrived from out of town ; she 'd had no place to stay ; one thing had led to another . But Margie Tallworth had hunt ; up on him before he could polish the story.  |p246Helen  smoked a little more . She watched Garp anxiously for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made love to Garp ; she felt guilty that she had made love to him not because she wanted to but because she wanted to reassure him , if he had been thinking that anything was wrong . He had n't been thinking , not much . Or : he had thought , but only once , about the bruises on the small , tight backs of Helen 's thighs ; though he was strong , Garp was a very gentle man with his children and his wife . He also knew what fingermark bruises looked like because he was a wrestler . It was a day or so later that he noticed the same small fingermark bruises on the backs of Duncan 's arms  --  just where Garp held him when Garp wrestled with the boy  --  and Garp concluded that he gripped the people he loved harder than he meant to . He concluded that the fingermarkson Helen were also his . He was too vain a man to be easily jealous . And the name he had woken with  --  on his lips , one morning  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Milton around the house , keeping Helen up at night . In fact , she was going to bed earlier and earlier ; she needed her rest . As for Helen , she developed a fondness for the bare , sharp shaft of the Volvo 's stick shift ; its bite at the end of the day , driving home from her office , felt good against the heel of her hand , and she often pressed against it until she felt it was only a hair away from the pressure necessary to break her skin . She could bring tears to her eyes , this way , and it made her feel clean again , when she arrived home  --  when the boys would wave and shout at her , from the window where the TV was ; and when Garp would announce what dinner he had prepared for them all , when Helen walked into the kitchen . Margie Tallworth 's possible knowledge had frightened Helen , because although Helen had said to Michael  --  and to herself  --  that it would be over the instant anyone knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end than she had first imagined . She hugged Garp in his kitchen and hoped for Margie Tallworth 's ignorance . Margie Tallworth was ignorant , but she was not ignorant of Michael Milton 's relationship with Helen . She was ignorant of many things but she knew about that . She was ignorant in that she thought her own shallow infatuation with Michael Milton had " surpassed , " as she would say , " the sexual " ; whereas , she assumed , Helen was merely amusing herself with Michael . In truth , Margie Tallworth had absolutely wallowed in , as she would say , " the sexual " ; it is difficult , in fact , to know what else her relationship with Michael Milton had been about . But she was not altogether wrong in assuming that this was what Helen 's relationship with Michael Milton was also about . Margie Tallworth was ignorant in that she assumed too much , too much of the time ; but in this case she had assumed correctly.  |p247Back  when Michael Milton and Helen were actually talking about Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that they were fucking . Margie Tallworth did not believe there was another kind of relationship that one could have with Michael Milton . In this one way , she was not ignorant . She may have known the kind of relationship Helen had with Michael before Helen knew it herself . And through the one-way glass of the fourth-floor ladies ' room , in the English and Literature Building , it was possible for Margie Tallworth to look through the tinted windshield of the three-ton Buick , gliding like the coffin of a king out of the parking lot . Margie could see Mrs. Garp 's slender legs stretched along the long front seat . It was a peculiar way to ride in a car with other than the best of friends . Margie knew their habits better than she understood her own ; she took long walks , to try to forget Michael Milton , and to familiarize herself with the whereabouts of Helen 's house . She was soon familiar with the habits of Helen 's husband , too , because Garp 's habits were much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from room to room , in the mornings ; perhaps he was out of a job . That fitted Margie Tallworth 's assumptions of the likely cuckold : a man who was out of work . At midday he burst out the door in track clothes and ran away ; miles later , he returned and read his mail , which nearly always came when he was gone . Then he padded back and forth in the house again ; he undressed , in pieces , on the way to the shower , and he was slow to dress when he was out of the shower . One thing did not fit her image of the cuckold : Garp had a good body . And why did he spend so much time in the kitchen ? Margie Tallworth wondered if perhaps he was an unemployed cook . Then his children came home and they broke Margie Tallworth 's soft little heart . He looked quite nice when he played with his children , which also fitted Margie 's assumptions of what a cuckold was like : someone who had witless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting planked . " Planked " was also a word that the wrestlers Garp knew used , and they had used it back at those blood-and-blue days at Steering , too . Someone was always bragging about planking a wet , split beaver . So one day , when Garp burst out the door in his track clothes , Margie Tallworth waited only as long as it took him to run away ; then she went up on the Garps ' porch with a perfumed note , which she intended to drop in his mail . She had thought very carefully that he would have time to read the note and ( hopefully ) recover himself before his children came home . This was how she assumed such news was absorbed : suddenly ! Then there was a reasonable period of recovery and one got ready to face the children . Here was another case of something Margie Tallworth was ignorant of . The note itself had given her trouble because she was not good with words . And it was perfumed not by intention but simply because everyp248piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , she would have realized perfume was inappropriate to this note , but that was another of the things she was ignorant of . Even her schoolworkwas perfumed ; when Helen had read Margie Tallworth 's first essay for Comp . Lit. 205 , she had cringed at its scent . What Margie 's note to Garp said was : Your Wife Is " Involved with " Michael MiltonMargie Tallworth would grow up to be the sort of person who said that someone " passed away " instead of died . Thus she sought delicacy with the words that Helen was " involved with " Michael Milton . And she had this sweetly smelling note in her hand , and she was poised on the Garps ' porch with it , when it began to rain . Nothing made Garp turn back from a run faster than rain . He hated getting his running shoes wet . He would run in the cold , and run in the snow , but when it rained , Garp ran home , swearing , and cooked for an hour in a foul-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus to the gym in time for wrestling practice . On the way , he picked up Walt from day care and took Walt to the gym with him ; he called home when he got to the gym to see if Duncan was back from school . Sometimes he gave Duncan instructions , if the meal was still cooking , but usually he just cautioned Duncan about riding his bike and he quizzed him about emergency phone numbers : did Duncan know what to dial in case of fire , explosion , armed robbery , mayhem in the streets ? Then he wrestled , and after practice he popped Walt into the shower with himself ; by the time he called home again , Helen was there to come pick them up . Therefore , Garp did not like rain ; although he enjoyed wrestling , rain complicated his simple plans . And Margie Tallworth was unprepared to see him suddenly panting and angry behind her on the porch . " Aaahhh ! " she cried ; she clutched her scented note as tightly as if it were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could stop . " Hello , " said Garp . She looked like a baby-sitter to him . He had trained himself off baby-sitters some time ago . He smiled at her with frank curiosity  --  that is all . " Aaa , " said Margie Tallworth ; she could n't speak . Garp looked at the crushed message in her hand ; she shut her eyes and held the note out to him , as if she were putting her hand into a fire . If at first Garp had thought she was one of Helen 's students , wanting something , now he thought something else . He saw that she could n't speak , and he saw the extreme self-consciousness of her handing him the note . Garp 's experience with speechless women who handed out notes self-con/sciously was limited to Ellen Jamesians , and he suppressed a momentary flame of anger  --  that another creepy Ellen Jamesian was introducing herself to him . Or had she come to bait him about something  --  the reclusive son of the exciting Jenny Fields ? HP I 'm Margie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Do You Know What an Ellen Jamesian Is ? The next thing you know , Garp thought , they 'll be organized like the religious morons who bring those righteous pamphlets about Jesus to one 's very door . It sickened him , for example , that the Ellen Jamesians were now reaching girls as young as this one ; she was too young to know , he thought , whether she wanted a tongue in her life or not . He shook his head and waved the note away . " Yes , yes , I know , I know , " Garp said . " So what ? " Poor Margie Tallworth was unprepared for this . She had come like an avenging angel  --  her terrible duty , and what a burden it was to her !  --  to bring the bad news that somehow must be made known . But he knew already ! And he did n't even care . She clutched her note in both her hands , so tightly to her pretty , trembling breasts that more of the perfume was expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her young-girl smell passed over Garp , who stood glaring at her . " I said , So whatT " Garp said . " Do you actually expect me to have respect for someone who cuts her own tongue off ? " Margie forced a word out . " What ? " she said ; she was frightened now . Now she guessed why the poor man padded around his house all day , out of work : he was insane . Garp had distinctly heard the word ; it was not a gagged " Aaahhh " or even a little " Aaa "  --  it was not the word of an amputated tongue . It was a whole word . " What ? " he said . " What ? " she said , again . He stared at the note she held against herself . " You can talk ? " he said . " Of course , " she croaked . " What 's that ? " he asked , and pointed to her note . But now she was afraid of him  --  an insane cuckold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , or murder her ; he looked strong enough to murder Michael Milton with one arm . And every man looked evil when he was questioning you . She backed away from him , off the porch.  | " Wait ! " Garp cried . " Is that a note for me ? What is that ? Is it something for Helen ? Who are you ? " Margie Tallworth shook her head . " It 's a mistake , " she whispered , and when she turned to flee , she collided with the wet mailman , spilling his bag and knocking herself back into Garp . Garp had a vision of Duna , the senile bear , bowling a mailman down a Viennese staircase  --  outlawed forever . But all that happened to Margie Tallworth was that she fell to the floor of the porch ; her stockings tore and she skinned one knee . The mailman , who assumed he 'd arrived at an awkward moment , fumbled for Garp 's mail among his strewn letters , but Garp was now only interested in what message the crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked her , gently ; he tried to help her to her feet , but she wanted to sit where she was . She kept sobbing . " I 'm sorry , " Margie Tallworth said . She had lost her nerve ; she had spent a minute too long around Garp , and now that she thought she rather liked him , it was hard for her to imagine giving him this news . " Your knee 's not too bad , " Garp said , " but let me get something to clean you up . " He went inside for antiseptic for her cut , and bandages , but she took this opportunity to limp away . She could not face him with this news , but she could not withhold it from him , either . She left her note for him . The mailman watched her hobble down the side street toward the corner where the buses stopped ; he wondered briefly what the Garps were up to . They seemed to get more mail than other families , too . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his editor , struggled to answer . And there were copies of books to review ; Garp gave them to Helen , who at least read them . There were Helen 's magazines ; it seemed to Garp there were a great many . There were Garp 's two magazines , his only subscriptions : Gourmet and Amateur Wrestling News . There were , of course , bills . And a letter rather frequently from Jenny ; it was all she wrote these days . And a letter now and then , short and sweet , from Ernie Holm . Sometimes Harry Fletcher wrote them both , and Alice still wrote with exquisite fluency , about nothing at all , to Garp . And now among the usual was a note , reeking of perfume and wet with tears . Garp put down the bottle of antiseptic and the bandages ; he did not bother to look for the girl . He held the crumpled note and thought he knew , more or less , what it would be about . He wondered why he had n't thought of it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; now that he thought of it , he supposed he had thought of it before , only not quite this consciously . The slow unwrappingof the note  --  so it would n't tear  --  made sounds as crisp as autumn , though all around Garp it was a cold March , the hurt ground thawing to mud . The little note snapped like bones as he opened it . Withp251the escaping perfume , Garp imagined he could still hear the girl 's sharp little yelp : " What ? " He knew " what " ; what he did n't know was " with whom "  --  that name , which had kicked around in his mind , one morning , but then was gone . The note , of course , would provide him with the name : Michael Milton : It sounded to Garp like a special kind of new ice cream at that shop he took the boys to . There was Strawberry Swirl , Chock-full of Chocolate , Mocha Madness , and Michael Milton . It was a disgusting name  --  a flavor Garp could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wadded the vilesmellingnote into pieces and stuffed them through the grate . Then he went inside the house and read the name in a phone book , over and over again . It seemed to him now that Helen had been " involved with " someone for a long time ; it seemed that he had known it for some time , too . But the name ! Michael Milton ! Garp had classified him  --  to Helen  --  at a party where Garp had been introduced to him . Garp had told Helen that Michael Milton was a " wimp " ; they had discussed his mustache . Michael Milton ! Garp read the name so many times , he was still peering into the phone book when Duncan got home from school and assumed that his father was once more searching a directory for his make-believe people . " Did n't you get Walt yet ? " Duncan asked . Garp had forgotten . And Walt has a cold , too , Garp thought . The boy should n't have to wait for me , with a cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Duncan . To Duncan 's surprise , Garp threw the phone book into the trash barrel . Then they walked to the bus stop . Garp was still in his track clothes , and it was still raining ; Duncan found this odd , too , but he did n't say anything about it . He said , " I got two goals today . " For some reason , all they played at Duncan 's school was soccer  --  fall , winter , and spring , they played only soccer . It was a small school , but there was another reason for all the soccer ; Garp forgot what it was . He had never liked the reason , anyway . " Two goals , " Duncan repeated . " That 's great , " Garp said . " One was a header , " Duncan said . " With your head ? " Garp said . " That 's wonderful . " " Ralph gave me a perfect pass , " Duncan said . " That 's still wonderful , " Garp said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan , but he knew Duncan would be embarrassed if he tried to kiss him ; it is Walt who lets me kiss him , Garp thought . Then he thought of kissing Helen and almost stepped in front of the bus . " Dad ! " Duncan said . And in the bus he asked his father , " Are you okay ? " " Sure , " Garp said.  | " I thought you 'd be up at the wrestling room , " Duncan said . " It is raining . " From Walt 's day care you could look across the river and Garp tried to place the exact location , there , of Michael Milton 's address , which he had memorized from the phone book . " Where were you ? " Walt complained . He coughed ; his nose dripped ; he felt hot . He expected to go wrestling whenever it rained . " Why do n't we all go to the wrestling room , as long as we 're downtown ? " Duncan said . He was increasingly logical , but Garp said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " Duncan wanted to know . " Because he 's got his running stuff on , dummy , " Walt said . " Oh , shut up , Walt , " Duncan said . They more or less fought on the bus , until Garp told them they could n't . Walt was sick , Garp reasoned , and fighting was bad for his cold . " I 'm not sick , " Walt said . " Yes , you are , " Garp said . " Yes , you are , " Duncan teased . " Shut up , Duncan , " Garp said . " Boy , you 're in a great mood , " Duncan said , and Garp wanted to kiss him ; Garp wished to assure Duncan that he was n't really in a bad mood , but kissing embarrassed Duncan , so Garp kissed Walt instead . " Dad ! " Walt complained . " You 're all wet and sweaty . " " Because he 's got his running stuff on , dummy , " Duncan said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard him , " Garp said . " I 'm not a dummy , " Walt said . " Yes , you are , " Duncan said . " Shut up , both of you , " Garp said . " Dad 's in a great mood , is n't he , Walt ? " Duncan asked his brother . " Sure is , " Walt said , and they decided to tease their father , instead of fight among themselves , until the bus deposited them  --  a few blocks from the house in the increasing rain . They were a soggy threesome when they were still a block from home , and a car that had been going too fast slowed suddenly beside them ; the window was rolled down , after a struggle , and in the steamy interior Garp saw the frazzled , glistening face of Mrs. Ralph . She grinned at them . " You seen Ralph ? " she asked Duncan . " Nope , " Duncan said . " The moron does n't know enough to come out of the rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either , " she said sweetly , to Garp ; she was still grinning and Garp tried to smile back at her , but he could n't think of anything to say . He must have had poor control of his expression , he suspected , because Mrs. Ralph would n't usually pass up the opportunity to go on teasing himp253in the rain . Yet , instead , she looked suddenly shocked by Garp 's ghastly smile ; she rolled her window back up . " See ya , " she called , and drove off . Slowly . " See ya , " Garp mumbled after her ; he admired the woman but he was thinking that maybe even this horror would eventually come to pass : that he would see Mrs. Ralph . In the house he gave Walt a hot bath , slipping into the tub with him  --  an excuse , which he often took , to wrestle with that little body . Duncan was too big for Garp to fit in the tub with him anymore . " What 's for supper ? " Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I forgot supper , " Garp called . " You forgot ? " Walt asked him , but Garp dunked Walt in the tub , and tickled him , and Walt fought back and forgot about the issue . " You forgot supper ? " Duncan hollered from downstairs . Garp decided he was not going to get out of the tub . He kept adding more hot water ; the steam was good for Walt 's lungs , he believed . He would try to keep the child in the tub with him as long as Walt was content to play . They were still in the bath together when Helen got home . " Dad forgot supper , " Duncan told her immediately . " He forgot supper ? " Helen said . " He forgot all about it , " Duncan said . " Where is he ? " Helen asked . " He 's taking a bath with Walt , " Duncan said . " They 've been taking a bath for hours . " " Heavens , " said Helen . " Maybe they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Garp hollered from his bath , upstairs . Duncan laughed . " He 's in a great mood , " Duncan told his mother . " I can see that he is , " Helen said . She put her hand softly on Duncan 's shoulder , being careful not to let him know that she was actually leaning on him for support . She felt suddenly unsure of her balance . Poised at the bottom of the stairs , she called up to Garp , " Had a bad day ? " But Garp slipped underwater ; it was a gesture of control , because he felt such hatred for her and he did n't want Walt to see it or hear it . There was no answer and Helen tightened her grip on Duncan 's shoulder . Please , not in front of the children , she thought . It was a new situation for her  --  that she should find herself in the defensive position in a matter of some contention with Garp  --  and she felt frightened . " Shall I come up ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his breath a long time . Walt shouted back downstairs to her , " Dad 's underwater ! "  | " Dad is so weird , " Duncan said . Garp came up for air just as Walt yelled again , " He 's holding his breath ! " I hope so , Helen thought . She did n't know what to do , she could n't move . In a minute or so , Garp whispered to Walt , " Tell her I 'm still underwater , Walt . Okay ? " Walt appeared to think this was a fiendishly clever trick and he yelled downstairs to Helen , " Dad 's still underwater ! " " Wow , " Duncan said . " We should time him . It must be a record . " But now Helen felt panicked . Duncan moved out from under her hand  --  he was starting up the stairs to see this breath-holding feat  --  and Helen felt that her legs were lead . " He 's still underwater ! " Walt shrieked , though Garp was drying Walt with a towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood naked on the bathmat by the big mirror together . When Duncan came into the bathroom , Garp silenced him by putting a finger to his lips . " Now , say it together , " Garp whispered . " On the count of three , He 's still under ! ' One , two , three . " " He 's still under ! " Duncan and Walt howled together , and Helen felt her own lungs burst . She felt a scream escape her but no sound emerged , and she ran up the stairs thinking that only her husband could have conceivedof such a plot to pay her back : drowning himself in front of their children and leaving her to explain to them why he did it . She ran crying into the bathroom , so surprising Duncan and Walt that she had to recover almost immediately  --  in order not to frighten them . Garp was naked at the mirror , slowly drying between his toes and watching her in a way she remembered that Ernie Holm had taught his wrestlers how to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " I already died . But it 's touching , and a little surprising , to see that you care . " " We 'll talk about this later ? " she asked him , hopefully  --  and smiling , as if it had been a good joke . " We fooled you ! " Walt said , poking Helen on that sharp bone above her hip . " Boy , if we 'd pulled that on you , " Duncan said to his father , " you 'd have really been pissed at us . " " The children have n't eaten , " Helen said . " Nobody 's eaten , " Garp said . " Unless you have . " " I can wait , " she told him . " So can I , " Garp told her . " I 'll get the kids something , " Helen offered , pushing Walt out of the bathroom . " There must be eggs , and cereal . "  | " For supper ? " Duncan said . " That sounds like a great supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan , " Garp said . " I want toast , " Walt said . " You can have toast , too , " Helen said . " Are you sure you can handle this ? " Garp asked Helen . She just smiled at him . " God , even I can handle toast , " Duncan said . " I think even Walt can fix cereal . " " The eggs are tricky , " Helen said ; she tried to laugh . Garp went on drying between his toes . When the kids were out of the bathroom , Helen poked her head back in . " I 'm sorry , and I love you , " Helen said , but he would n't look up from his deliberate procedure with the towel . " 1 never wanted to hurt you , " she went on . " How did you find out ? I have never once stopped thinking of you . Was it that girl ? " Helen whispered , but Garp gave all his attention to his toes . When she had set out food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would think to herself , later ) , she went back upstairs to him . He was still in front of the mirror , sitting naked on the edge of the tub . " He means nothing ; he never took anything away from you , " she told him . " It 's all over now , really it is . " " Since when ? " he asked her . " As of now , " she said to Garp . " I just have to tell him . " " Do n't tell him , " Garp said . " Let him guess . " " I ca n't do that , " Helen said . " There 's shell in my egg ! " Walt hollered from downstairs . " My toast is burnt ! " Duncan said . They were plotting together to distract their parents from each other  --  whether they knew it or not . Children , Garp thought , have some instinct for separating their parents when their parents ought to be separated . " Just eat it ! " Helen called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tried to touch Garp but he slipped past her , out of the bathroom ; he started to dress . " Eat up and I 'll take you to a movie ! " he called to the kids . " What are you doing that for ? " Helen asked him . " I 'm not staying here with you , " he said . " We 're going out . You call that wimpish asshole and say good-bye . " " He 'll want to see me , " Helen said , dully  --  the reality of having it over , now that Garp knew about it , was working on her like Novocain . If she had been sensitive to how much she 'd hurt Garp , at first , now her feelings for him were deadening slightly and she was feeling for herself again . " Tell him to eat his heart out , " Garp said . " You wo n't see him . No last fucks for the road , Helen . Just tell him good-bye . On the phone . "  | " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Use the phone , " Garp said . " I 'll take the kids out . We 'll see a movie . Please have it over with before we come back . You wo n't see him again . " " I wo n't , I promise , " Helen said . " But I should see him , just once  --  to tell him . " " I suppose you feel you 've handled this very decently , " Garp said . Helen , to a point , did feel so ; she did n't say anything . She felt she had never lost sight of Garp and the children during this indulgence ; she felt justified in handling it her way , now . " We should talk about this later , " she said to him . " Some perspective will be possible , later . " He would have struck her if the children had n't burst into the room . " One , two , three , " Duncan chanted to Walt . " The cereal is stale ! " Duncan and Walt hollered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your father and I are having a little fight . Go downstairs . " They stared at her . " Please , " Garp said to them . He turned away from them so they would n't see him crying , but Duncan probably knew , and surely Helen knew . Walt probably did n't catch it . " A fight ? " Walt said . " Come on , " Duncan said to him ; he took Walt 's hand . Duncan pulled Walt out of the bedroom . " Come on , Walt , " Duncan said , " or we wo n't get to see the movie . " " Yeah , the movie ! " Walt cried . To his horror , Garp recognized the attitude of their leaving  --  Duncan leading Walt away , and down the stairs ; the smaller boy turning and lookingback . Walt waved , but Duncan pulled him on . Down and gone , into the bomb shelter . Garp hid his face in his clothes and cried . When Helen touched him , he said , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen shut the bedroom door . " Oh , do n't , " she pleaded . " He is n't worth this ; he was n't anything . I just enjoyed him , " she tried to explain , but Garp shook his head violently and threw his pants at her . He was still only half dressed  --  an attitude that was perhaps , Helen realized , the most compromising for men : when they were not one thing and also not another . A woman half dressed seemed to have some power , but a man was simply not as handsome as when he was naked , and not as secure as when he was clothed . " Please get dressed , " she whispered to him , and handed him back his pants . He took them , he pulled them on ; and went on crying . " I 'll do just what you want , " she said . " You wo n't see him again ? " he said to her . " No , not once , " she said . " Not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Garp said . " He should n't even be going out , but it 's not too bad for him at a movie . And we wo n't be late , " he added to her . " Go see if he 's dressed warmly enough . " She did . He opened her top drawer , where her lingerie was , and pulled the drawer from the dresser ; he pushed his face into the wonderful silkiness and scent of her clothes  --  like a bear holding a great trough of food in his forepaws , and then losing himself in it . When Helen came back into the room and caught him at this , it was almost as if she 'd caught him masturbating . Embarrassed , he brought the drawer down across his knee and cracked it ; her underwear flew about . He raised the cracked drawer over his head and smacked it down against the edge of the dresser , snapping what felt like the spine of an animal about the size of the drawer . Helen ran from the room and he finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Duncan 's plate ; he saw Walt 's uneaten supper on Walt 's plate , and on various parts of the table and floor . " If you do n't eat , Walt , " Garp said , " you 'll grow up to bea wimp . " " I 'm not going to grow up , " Walt said . That gave Garp such a shiver that he turned on Walt and startled the child . " Do n't ever say that , " Garp said . " I do n't want to grow up , " Walt said . " Oh , I see , " Garp said , softening . " You mean , you like being a kid ? " " Yup , " Walt said . " Walt is so weird , " Duncan said . " I am not ! " Walt cried . " You are so , " Duncan said . " Go get in the car , " Garp said . " And stop fighting . " " You were fighting , " Duncan said , cautiously ; no one reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , " he said . " Yeah , the movie ! " Walt said . They went out . Garp said to Helen , " He 's not to come here , under any circumstances . If you let him in this house , he wo n't get out alive . And you 're not to go out , " he said . " Under any circumstances . Please , " he added , and he had to turn away from her . " Oh , darling , " Helen said . " He 's such an asshole ! " Garp moaned . " It could never be anyone like you , do n't you see ? " Helen said . " It could only be someone who was n't at all like you . " He thought of the baby-sitters and Alice Fletcher , and his inexplicable attraction to Mrs. Ralph , and of course he knew what she meant ; he walked out the kitchen door . It was raining outside , and already dark ; perhaps the rain would freeze . The mud in the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , by habit , he edged the car to the top of the driveway andp258cut the engine and the lights . Down the Volvo rolled , but he knew the driveway 's dark curve by heart . The kids were thrilled by the sound of the gravel and the slick mud in the growing blackness , and when he popped the clutch at the bottom of the driveway , and flicked on the lights , both Walt and Duncan cheered . " What movie are we going to see ? " Duncan asked . " Anything you want , " Garp said . They drove downtown to have a look at the posters . It was cold and damp in the car and Walt coughed ; the windshield kept fogging over , which made it hard to see what was playing at the movie houses . Walt and Duncan continued to fight about who got to stand in the gap between the bucket seats ; for some reason , this had always been the prime spot in the back seat for them , and they had always fought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and bumping Garp 's elbow when he used the stick shift . " Get out of there , both of you , " Garp said . " It 's the only place you can see , " Duncan said . " I 'm the only one who has to see , " Garp said . " And this defroster is such junk , " he added , " that no one can see out the windshield anyway . " " Why do n't you write the Volvo people ? " Duncan suggested . Garp tried to imagine a letter to Sweden about the inadequacies of the defrost system , but he could n't sustain the idea for very long . On the floor , in back , Duncan kneeled on Walt 's foot and pushed him out of the gap between the bucket seats ; now Walt cried and coughed . " I was here first , " Duncan said . Garp downshifted , hard , and the uncovered tip of the stick-shift shaft bit into his hand . " You see this , Duncan ? " Garp asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a spear . You want to fall on that if I have to stop hard ? " " Why do n't you get it fixed ? " Duncan asked . " Get out of the goddamn gap between the seats , Duncan ! " Garp said . " The stick shift has been like that for months , " Duncan said " For weeks , maybe , " Garp said . " If it 's dangerous , you should get it fixed , " Duncan said . " That 's your mother 's job , " Garp said . " She says it 's your job , Dad , " Walt said . " How 's your cough , Walt ? " Garp asked . Walt coughed . The wet rattle in his small chest seemed oversized for the child . " Jesus , " Duncan said . " That 's great , Walt , " Garp said . " It 's not my fault , " Walt complained . " Of course it is n't , " Garp said.  | " Yes , it is , " Duncan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do not ! " Walt said . " Look for a movie that looks interesting , Duncan , " Garp said . " I ca n't see unless I kneel between the seats , " Duncan said . They drove around . The movie houses were all on the same block but they had to drive past them a few times to decide upon which movie , and then they had to drive by them a few more times before they found a place to park . The children chose to see the only film that had a line waiting to see it , extending out from under the cinema marquee along the sidewalk , streaked now with a freezing rain . Garp put his own jacket over Walt 's head , so that very quickly Walt resembled some ill-clothed street beggar  --  a damp dwarf seeking sympathy in bad weather . He promptly stepped in a puddle and soaked his feet ; Garp then picked him up and listened to his chest . It was almost as if Garp thought the water in Walt 's wet shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so weird , Dad , " Duncan said . Walt saw a strange car and pointed it out . The car moved quickly down the soaked street ; splashing through the garish puddles , it threw the reflected neon upon itself  --  a big dark car , the color of clotted blood ; it had wooden slats on its sides , and the blond wood glowed in the streetlights . The slats looked like the ribs of the long , lit skeleton of a great fish gliding through moonlight . " Look at that car ! " Walt cried . " Wow , it 's a hearse , " Duncan said . " No , Duncan , " Garp said . " It 's an old Buick . Before your time . " The Buick that Duncan mistook for a hearse was on its way to Garp 's house , although Helen had done all she could to discourage Michael Milton from coming . " I ca n't see you , " Helen told him when she called . " It 's as simple as that . It 's over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever found out . I wo n't hurt him any more than I already have . " " What about me ? " Michael Milton said . " I 'm sorry , " Helen told him . " But you knew . We both knew . " " I want to see you , " he said . " Maybe tomorrow ? " But she told him that Garp had taken the kids to a movie for the sole purpose that she finish it tonight . " I 'm coming over , " he told her . " Not here , no , " she said . " We 'll go for a drive , " he told her . " I ca n't go out , either , " she said . " I 'm coming , " Michael Milton said , and he hung up . Helen checked the time . It would be all right , she supposed , if she could get him to leave quickly . Movies were at least an hour and a halfp260long . She decided she would n't let him in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlights to come up the driveway , and when the Buick stopped  --  just in front of the garage , like a big ship docking at a dark pier  --  she ran out of the house and pushed herself against the driver'ssidedoor before Michael Milton could open it . The rain was turning to a semisoft slush at her feet , and the icy drops were hardening as they fell  --  they had some sting as they struck her bare neck , when she bent over to speak to him through the rolled-down window . He immediately kissed her . She tried to lightly peck his cheek but he turned her face and forced his tongue into her mouth . All over again she saw the corny bedroom of his apartment : the poster-sized print above his bed  --  Paul Klee 's Sinbad the Sailor . She supposed this was how he saw himself : a colorful adventurer , but sensitive to the beauty of Europe . Helen pulled back from him and felt the cold rain soak her blouse . " We ca n't just stop , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain through the open window or tears that streaked his face . To her surprise , he had shaved his mustache off , and his upper lip looked slightly like the puckered , undeveloped lip of a child  --  like Walt 's little lip , which looked lovely on Walt , Helen thought ; but it was n't her idea of the lip for a lover . " What did you do to your mustache ? " she asked him . " I thought you did n't like it , " he said . " I did it for you . " " But I liked it , " she said , and shivered in the freezing rain . " Please , get in with me , " he said . She shook her head ; her blouse clung to her cold skin and her long corduroy skirt felt as heavy as chain mail ; her tall boots slipped in the stiffening slush . " I wo n't take you anywhere , " he promised . " We 'll just sit here , in the car . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd have to , " Helen said . " We knew it was just for a little while . " Michael Milton let his head sink against the glinting ring of the horn ; but there was no sound , the big Buick was shut off . The rain began to stick to the windows  --  the car was slowly being encased in ice . " Please get in , " Michael Milton moaned . " I 'm not leaving here , " he added , sharply . " I 'm not afraid of him . I do n't have to do what he says . " " It 's what I say , too , " Helen said . " You have to go . " " I 'm not going , " Michael Milton said . " I know about your husband . I know everything about him . " They had never talked about Garp ; Helen had forbidden it . She did n't know what Michael Milton meant . " He 's a minor writer , " Michael said , boldly . Helen looked surprised ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd told her oncep261that he never read living writers ; he claimed to value the perspective he said one could gain only when a writer had been dead for a while . It is fortunate that Garp did n't know this about him  --  it would certainly have added to Garp 's contempt for the young man . It added somewhat to Helen 's disappointment with poor Michael , now . " My husband is a very good writer , " she said softly , and a shiver made her twitch so hard that her folded arms sprang open and she had to fold them closed at her breasts again . " He 's not a major writer , " Michael declared . " Higgins said so . You certainly must be aware of how your husband is regarded in the depart-ment . " Higgins , Helen was aware , was a singularly eccentric and troublesome colleague , who managed at the same time to be dull and cloddish to the point of sleep . Helen hardly felt Higgins was representative of the department  --  except that like many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate students about his fellow department members ; in this desperate way , perhaps , Higgins felt he gained the students ' trust . " I was not aware that Garp was regarded by the department , one way or another , " Helen said coolly . " Most of them do n't read anything very contemporary . " " Those who do say he 's minor , " Michael Milton said . This competitive and pathetic stand did not warm Helen 's heart to the boy and she turned to go back inside the house . " I wo n't go ! " Michael Milton screamed . " I 'll confront him about us ! Right now . He ca n't tell us what to do . " " I 'm telling you , Michael , " Helen said . He slumped against the horn and began to cry . She went over and touched his shoulder through the window . " I 'll sit with you a minute , " Helen told him . " But you must promise me that you 'll leave . I wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Give me the keys , " Helen said . His look of baleful hurt  --  that she did n't trust him not to drive off with her  --  touched Helen all over again . She put the keys in the deep flap pocket of her long skirt and walked around to the passenger side and let herself in . He rolled up his window , and they sat , not touching , the windows fogging around them , the car creaking under a coat of ice . Then he completely broke down and told her that she had meant more to him than all of France  --  and she knew what France had meant to him , of course . She held him , then , and wildly feared how much time had passed , or was passing there in the frozen car . Even if it was not a long movie , they must still have a good half hour , or forty-five minutes ; yet Michaelp262Milton was nowhere near ready to leave . She kissed him , strongly , hoping this would help , but he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt all over as frozen to him as she had felt outside in the hardening sleet . But she let him touch her . " Dear Michael , " she said , thinking all the while . " How can we stop ? " was all he said . But Helen had already stopped ; she was only thinking about how to stop him . She shoved him up straight in the driver 's position and stretched across the long seat , pulling her skirt back down to cover her knees , and putting her head in his lap . " Please remember , " she said . " Please try . This was the nicest part for me  --  just letting you drive me in the car , when I knew where we were going . Ca n't you be happy  --  ca n't you just remember that , and let it go ? " He sat rigid behind the steering wheel , both hands struggling to stay gripped to the wheel , both thighs tensed under her head , his erection pressingagainst her ear . " Please try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said softly . And they stayed this way a moment , imagining that the old Buick was carrying them to Michael 's apartment again . But Michael Milton could not sustain himself on imagination . He let one hand stray to the back of Helen 's neck , which he gripped very tightly ; his other hand opened his fly . " Michael ! " she said , sharply . " You said you always wanted to , " he reminded her . " It 's over , Michael . " " Not yet , it is n't , " he said . His penis grazed her forehead , bent her eyelashes , and she recognized that this was the old Michael  --  the Michael of the apartment , the Michael who occasionally liked to treat her with some force . She did not appreciate it now . But if I resist , she thought , there will be a scene . She had only to imagine Garp as a part of the scene to convinceherself that she should avoid any scene , at any cost . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael , " she said . " Do n't spoil it . " " You always said you wanted to , " he said . " But it was n't safe , you said . Well , now it 's safe . The car is n't even moving . There ca n't be any accidents now , " he said . Oddly , she realized , he had suddenly made it easier for her . She did not feel concerned anymore with letting him down gently ; she felt grateful to him that he had helped her to sort her priorities so forcefully . Her priorities , she felt enormously relieved to know , were Garp and her children . Walt should n't be out in this weather , she thought , shivering . And Garp was more major to her , she knew , than all her minor colleagues and graduate students together . Michael Milton had allowed her to see himself with what struck Helenp263as a necessary vulgarity . Suck him off , she thought bluntly , putting him into her mouth , and then he 'll leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were rather quick to abandon their demands . And from her brief experience in Michael Milton 's apartment , Helen knew that this would not take long . Time was also a factor in her decision ; there was at least twenty minutesremaining in even the shortest movie they could have gone to see . She set her mind to it as she might have done if it were the last task remainingto a messy business , which might have ended better but could also have turned out worse ; she felt slightly proud that she had at least proved to herselfthat her family was her first priority . Even Garp might appreciate this , she thought ; but one day , not right away . She was so determined that she hardly noticed Michael Milton 's grip loosen on her neck ; he returned both hands to the steering wheel , as if he were actually piloting this experience . Let him think what he wants to think , she thought . She was thinking of her family , and she did not notice that the sleet was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Buick like the tapping of countless hammers , driving little nails . And she did not sense the old car groaning and snapping under its thickening tomb of ice . And she did not hear the telephone , ringing in her warm house . There was too much weather , and other interference , between her house and where she lay . It was a stupid movie . Typical of the children 's taste in films , Garp thought ; typical of the taste in a university town . Typical of the entire country . Typical of the world ! Garp raged , in his heart , and paid more attention to Walt 's labored breathing  --  the thick rivulets of snot from his tiny nose . " Be careful you do n't choke on that popcorn , " he whispered to Walt . " I wo n't choke , " Walt said , never taking his eyes from the giant screen . " Well , you ca n't breathe very well , " Garp complained , " so just do n't put too much in your mouth . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , at all  --  that 's perfectly clear . " And he wiped the child 's nose again . " Blow , " he whispered . Walt blew . " Is n't this great ? " Duncan whispered . Garp felt how hot Walt 's snot was ; the child must have a temperature of nearly o2  --  ! he thought . Garp rolled his eyes at Duncan . " Oh , just great , Duncan , " Garp said . Duncan had meant the movie . " You should relax , Dad , " Duncan suggested , shaking his head . Oh , I should , Garp knew ; but he could n't . He thought of Walt , and what ap264perfect little ass he had , and strong little legs , and how sweet his sweat smelled when he 'd been running and his hair was damp behind his ears . A body that perfect should not be sick , he thought . I should have let Helen go out on this miserable night ; I should have made her call that twerp from her office  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Or in a light socket . And turn on the juice ! I should have called that candy-ass myself , Garp thought . I should have visited him in the middle of the night . When Garp walked up the aisle to see if they had a phone in the lobby , he heard Walt still coughing . If she has n't already gotten in touch with him , Garp thought , I 'll tell her not to keep trying ; I 'll tell her it 's my turn . He was at that point in his feelings toward Helen where he felt betrayed but at the same time honestly loved and important to her ; he had not had time enough to ponder how betrayed he felt  --  or how much , truly , she had been trying to keep him in her mind . It was a delicate point , between hating her and loving her terribly  --  also , he was not without sympathy for whatever she 'd wanted ; after all , he knew , the shoe on the other foot had also been worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Garp , that Helen , who had always meant so well , had been caught like this ; she was a good woman and she certainly deserved better luck . But when Helen did not answer the phone , this point of delicacy in Garp 's feelings toward her quite suddenly escaped him . He felt only rage , and only betrayal . Bitch ! he thought . The phone rang and rang . She went out , to meet him . Or they 're even doing it in our house ! he thought  --  he could hear them saying , " One last time . " That puny fink with his pretentious short stories about fragile relationships , which almost developed in badly lit European restaurants . ( Perhaps someone wore the wrong glove and the moment was lost forever ; there was one where a woman decides not to , because the man 's shirt was too tight at his throat . ) How could Helen have read that crap ! And how could she have touched that foppish body ? " But the movie is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a duel . " " I want to see the duel , " Walt said . " What 's a duel ? " " We 're leaving , " Garp told them . " No ! " Duncan hissed . " Walt 's sick , " Garp mumbled . " He should n't be here . " " I 'm not sick , " Walt said . " He 's not that sick , " Duncan said . " Get out of those seats , " Garp told them ; he had to grab the front of Duncan 's shirt , which made Walt get up and stumble into the aisle first . Duncan , grumbling , scuffed after him . " What 's a duel ? " Walt asked Duncan.  | " It 's real neat , " Duncan said . " Now you wo n't ever see it . " " Cut it out , Duncan , " Garp said . " Do n't be mean . " " You 're the one who 's mean , " Duncan said . " Yeah , Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the windshield solid with it ; there were various scrapers and broken snow brushes and junk of that sort , somewhere in the trunk , Garp supposed . But by March the winter driving had worn out much of this equipment , or the children had played with it and lost it . Garp was n't going to take the time to clean the windshield , anyway . " How can you see ? " Duncan asked . " I live here , " Garp said . " I do n't have to see . " But , in fact , he had to roll down the driver's-side window and stick his face out into the raining sleet , as hard as hail ; he drove toward home that way . " It 's cold , " Walt shivered . " Shut the window ! " " I need it open to see , " Garp said . " I thought you did n't have to see , " Duncan said . " I 'm too cold ! " Walt cried . Dramatically , he coughed . But all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was to blame  --  for however Walt suffered his cold , or for its growing worse : it was her fault . And for Duncan 's disappointment in his father , for that unforgivable way in the theater that Garp had grabbed the boy and stood him up out of his seat : she was to blame . The bitch with her runt lover ! But at the moment his eyes were teary in the cold wind and the sleet , and he thought to himself how he loved Helen and would never be unfaithful to her again  --  never hurt her like this , he would promise her that . At the same moment Helen felt her conscience clear . Her love for Garp was very fine . And she sensed that Michael Milton was about to be released ; he was exhibiting the familiar signs . The angle that he bent at the waist and the peculiar way he pointed his hips ; the straining of that muscle , used for little else , on the inside of his thigh . It 's almost over , Helen thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckle and the back of her head humped the bottom of the steering wheel , which Michael Milton gripped as if he expected the three-ton Buick to suddenly leave the ground . Garp hit the bottom of his driveway at about forty miles per hour . He came off the downhill road in third gear and accelerated just as he exited ; he glimpsed how the driveway was glazed with frozen slush , and he worried momentarily that the Volvo might slip on the short uphill curve . He held the car in gear until he felt what grip he had of the road ; it was good enough , and he popped the sharp stick shift into neutral  --  a second before he killed the engine and flicked out the headlights . They coasted up , into the black rain . It was like that moment when you feel an airplane lift off the runway ; the children both cried out inp266excitement . Garp could feel the children at his elbow , crowding each other for the one favored position in the gap between the bucket seats . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't have to see , " Walt said . There was a high thrill in Walt 's voice , which suggested to Garp that Walt wished to reassure himself . " I know this by heart , " Garp assured them . " It 's like being underwater ! " cried Duncan ; he held his breath . " It 's like a dream ! " said Walt ; he reached for his brother 's hand.  |p267HAT  was how Jenny Fields became a kind of nurse again ; after allher years in her white uniform , nursing the women 's movement , Jenny was appropriately dressed for her role . It was at Jenny 's suggestion that the Garp family moved into the Fields estate at Dog 's I read Harbor . There were many rooms for Jenny to take care of them in , and there was the healing sound of the sea , rushing in and out , rinsing everything clean . All his life , Duncan Garp would associate the sound of the sea with his convalescence . His grandmother would remove the bandage ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan 's right eye had been . his father and mother could not stand the sight of that empty hole , but Jenny was an old hand at staring down wounds until they went away . It was with his grandmother , Jenny Fields , that Duncan would see his first glass eye . " See ? " Jenny said . " It 's big and brown ; it 's not quite as pretty as your left one , but you just make sure the girls see your left one first . " It was not a very feminist thing to say , she supposed , but Jenny always said that she was , first and foremost , a nurse . Duncan 's eye was gouged out when he was flung forward between the bucket seats ; the uncovered tip of the stick-shift shaft was the first thing to break his fall . Garp 's right arm , reaching into the gap between the seats , was too late ; Duncan passed under it , putting out his right eye and breaking three fingers of his right hand , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate could the Volvo have been moving faster than twenty-five  --  at the most , thirty-five  --  miles per hour , but the collision wasp268astonishing . The three-ton Buick did not yield quite an inch to Garp 's coasting car . Inside the Volvo the children were like eggs out of the egg box  --  loose inside the shopping bag  --  at the moment of impact . Even insidethe Buick , the jolt had surprising ferocity . Helen 's head was flung forward , narrowly missing the steering column , which caught her at the back of her neck . Many wrestlers ' children have hardy necks , because Helen 's did not break  --  though she wore a brace for almost six weeks , and her back would bother her the rest of her life . Her right collarbone was broken , perhaps by the rising slam of Michael Milton'sknee , and her nose was gashed across the bridge  --  requiring nine stitches  --  by what must have been Michael Milton 's belt buckle . Helen 's mouth was snapped shut with such force that she broke two teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought she had bitten her tongue off , because she could feel it swimming in her mouth , which was full of blood ; but her head ached so severely that she did n't dare open her mouth , until she had to breathe , and she could n't move her right arm . She spat what she thought was her tongue into the palm of her left hand . It was n't her tongue , of course . It was what amounted to three quarters of Michael Milton 's penis . The warm wash of blood over her face felt , to Helen , like gasoline ; she began to scream  --  not for her own safety , but for Garp 's and the children 's . She knew what had hit the Buick . She struggled to get out of Michael Milton 's lap because she had to see what had happened to her family . She dropped what she thought was her tongue on the floor of the Buick and with her good left arm she punched Michael Milton , whose lap pinned her against the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams above her own . Michael Milton was screaming , of course , but Helen heard beyond him  --  to the Volvo . That was Duncan who was screaming , she was sure , and Helen fought her left arm across Michael Milton 's bleeding lap to the door handle . When the door opened , she pushed Michael out of the Buick ; she felt incredibly strong . Michael never once corrected his bent-double , sitting-up position ; he lay on his side in the freezing slush as if he were still in the driver 's seat , though he bellowed and bled like a steer . When the door light came on in the huge Buick , Garp could dimly see the gore in the Volvo  --  Duncan 's streaming face , split with his gaping wail . Garp began to bellow , too , but his bellow issued forth no louder than a whimper ; his own , odd sound scared him so much that he tried to talk softly to Duncan . It was then that Garp realized he could n't talk . When Garp had flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned almost sideways in the driver 's seat and his face had struck the steering wheel hard enough to break his jaw and mangle his tongue ( twelvep269stitches ) . In the long weeks of Garp 's recovery , at Dog 's Head Harbor , it is fortunate for Jenny that she 'd had much experience with Ellen Jamesians , because Garp 's mouth was wired shut and his messages to his mother were written ones . He sometimes wrote pages and pages , on the typewriter , which Jenny would then read aloud to Duncan  --  because , althoughDuncan could read , he was instructed not to strain his remaining eye more than was necessary . In time , the eye would compensate for the other eye 's loss , but Garp had much to say that was immediate  --  and no way to say it . When he sensed that his mother was editing his remarks  --  to Duncan , and to Helen ( to whom he also wrote pages and pages )  --  Garp would grunt his protest through his wires , holding his sore tongue very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , would wisely move him to a private room . " This is the Dog 's Head Harbor Hospital , " Helen said to Jenny once . Although Helen could talk , she said little ; she did not have pages and pages to say . She spent most of her convalescence in Duncan 's room , reading to the boy , because Helen was a much  --  better reader than Jenny , and there were only two stitches in Helen 's tongue . In this period of recovery , Jenny Fields could deal with Garp better than Helen could deal with him . Helen and Duncan often sat side by side in Duncan 's room . Duncan had a fine , one-eyed view of the sea , which he watched all day as if he were a camera . Getting used to having one eye is something like getting used to the world through a camera ; there are similarities in depth of field , and in the problems of focus . When Duncan seemed ready to discover this , Helen bought him a camera  --  a single-lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sense . It was in this period of time , Duncan Garp would recall , that the thought of being an artist , a painter and a photographer , first occurred to him ; he was almost eleven . Although he had been athletic , his one eye would make him ( like his father ) forever leery of sports involving balls . f . ven running , he said , he was bothered by the lack of peripheral vision ; Duncan claimed it made him clumsy . It was eventually added to Garp 's sadness that Duncan did not care for wrestling , either . Duncan spoke in terms of the camera , and he told his father that one of his problems with depth of field included not knowing how far away the mat was . " When I wrestle , " he told Garp , " I feel like I 'm going downstairs in the dark ; I do n't know when I get to the bottom until I feel it . " Garp concluded , of course , that the accident had made Duncan insecure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always had a certain timidity , a reserve  --  even though he was good at games , and clearly well coordinated , he 'd always had a tendency not to participate . Not as energetically , certainly , as Walt  --  who was intrepid , who flung his body into every newp270circumstance with faith and grace and with temerity . Walt , Helen said , was the real athlete between them . After a while , Garp supposed she was right . " Helen is often right , you know , " Jenny told Garp one night at Dog 's Head Harbor . The context of this remark could have been anything , but it was sometime soon after the accident , because Duncan had his own room , and Helen had her own room , and Garp had his own room , and so forth . Helen is often right , his mother had told him , but Garp looked angry and wrote Jenny a note . Not this time , Mom , said the note , meaning  --  perhaps  --  Michael Milton . Meaning : the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen resigned . The availability of Jenny 's big hospital on the ocean , as both Garp and Helen would come to think of it , was a way to leave the unwanted familiarityof their house , and of that driveway . And in the faculty code of ethics , " moral turpitude " is listed as one ground for revoking tenure  --  though this never came to debate ; sleeping with students was not generally treated too harshly . It might be a hidden reason why a faculty member was n't given tenure ; it would rarely be a reason for revoking someone 's tenure . Helen may have supposed that biting off three quarters of a student 's penis was fairly high on the scale of conceivableabuse to students . Sleeping with them simply happened , though it was not encouraged ; there were many worse ways of evaluating students and categorizing them for life . But amputation of their genitalia was certainlysevere , even for bad students , and Helen must have felt inclined to punish herself . So she denied herself the pleasure of continuing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she removed herself from the arousementthat books and their discussion had always meant to her . In her later life , Helen would spare herself considerable unhappiness by refusing to feel guilty ; in her later life , the whole business with Michael Milton would more often make her angry than it would make her sad  --  because she was strong enough to believe that she was a good woman , which she was , who 'd been made to suffer disproportionately for a trivial indiscretion . But at least for a time , Helen would heal herself and her family . Never having had a mother , and having had little chance to use Jenny Fields in that way , Helen submitted to this period of hospitalization at Dog 's Head Harbor . She calmed herself by nursing Duncan , and she hoped that Jenny could nurse Garp.  |p271This  aura of the hospital was not new to Garp , whose earliest experiences  --  withfear , with dreams , with sex  --  had all occurred in the infirmary atmosphere of the old Steering School . He adapted . It helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , because this made him careful ; it made him reconsider many of the things he might have thought he wanted to say . When he saw them written down  --  these raw thoughts  --  he realized that he could n't or should n't say them ; when he went to revise them , he knew better and threw them away . There was one for Helen , which read : Three quarters is not enough . He threw it away . Then he wrote one for Helen that he did give to her . I do n't blame you . Later , he wrote another one . I do n't blame me , either , the note said . Only in this way can we be whole again , Garp wrote to his mother . And Jenny Fields padded whitely through the salt-damp house , room to room with her nursing ways and Garp 's notes . It was all the writing he could manage . Of course , the house at Dog 's Head Harbor was used to recoveries . Jenny 's wounded women had gotten hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among them , the sadnessof Roberta Muldoon , who had lived there with Jenny through themost difficult periods of her sex reassignment . In fact , Roberta had failedat living alone  --  and at living with a number of men  --  and she was backliving at Dog 's Head Harbor with Jenny again when the Garps moved in . As the spring warmed up , and the hole that had been Duncan 's righteye slowly healed and was less vulnerable to sticking bits of sand , Robertatook Duncan to the beach . It was on the beach that Duncan discovered hisdepth-of-field problem as it was related to a thrown ball , because RobertaMuldoon tried playing catch with Duncan and very soon hit him in theface with the football . They gave up the ball , and Roberta contentedDuncan with diagraming , in the sand , all the plays she once ran at the tightend position for the Philadelphia Eagles ; she focused on the part of theEagles offense that concerned her , when she was Robert Muldoon , No. 90 , and she relived for Duncan her occasional touchdown passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious hits . " It was against the Cowboys , " she told Duncan . " We were playing in Dallas , when that snake inp272the grass  --  Eight Ball , everyone called him  --  came up on my blind side . . . " And Roberta would regard the quiet child , who had a blind side for life , and she would delaychange the subject . To Garp , Roberta 's subject was the ticklish detail of sex reassignment , because Garp seemed interested and Roberta knew that Garp probably liked hearing about a problem so thoroughly removed from his own . " I always knew I should have been a girl , " she told Garp . " I dreamed about having love made to me , by a man , but in the dreams I was always a woman ; I was never a man having love made to me by another man . " There was more than a hint of distaste in Roberta 's references to homosexuals , and Garp thought it strange that people in the process of making a decision that will plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less tolerant of other minorities than we might imagine . There was even a bitchiness about Roberta , when she complained of the other troubled women who came to get well at Dog 's Head Harbor with Jenny Fields . " That damn lesbian crowd , " Roberta said to Garp . " They 're trying to make your mother into something she is n't . " " I sometimes think that 's what Mom is for , " Garp teased Roberta . " She makes people happy by letting them think she is something she is n't . " " Well , they tried to confuse me , " Roberta said . " When I was preparing myself for the operation , they kept trying to talk me out of it . Be gay , ' they said . If you want men , have them as you are . If you become a woman , you 'll just be taken advantage of , ' they told me . They were all cowards , " Roberta concluded , though Garp knew , sadly , that Roberta had been taken advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unique ; Garp pondered how these other women in his mother 's house , and in her care , had all been victims of intolerance  --  yet most of them he 'd met seemed especially intolerant of each other . It was a kind of infighting that made no sense to Garp and he marveled at his mother sorting them all out , keeping them happy and out of each other 's hair . Robert Muldoon , Garp knew , had spent several months in drag before his actual operation . He 'd go off in the morning dressed as Robert Muldoon ; he went out shopping for women 's clothes , and almost no one knew that he paid for his sex change with the banquet fees he collected for the speeches he gave to boys ' clubs and men 's clubs . In the evenings , at Dog 's Head Harbor , Robert Muldoon would model his new clothes for Jenny and the critical women who shared her house . When the estrogen hormones began to enlarge his breasts and shift the former tight end 's shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from the Dog 's Head Harbor house in mannish women 's suits and rather conservative wigs ; he tried being Roberta long before he had the surgery . Clinically , now , Roberta had the same genitalia and urological equipment as most other women.  | " But of course I ca n't conceive , " she told Garp . " I do n't ovulate and I do n't menstruate . " Neither do millions of other women , Jenny Fields had reassured her . " When I came home from the hospital , " Roberta said to Garp , " do you know what else your mother told me ? " Garp shook his head ; " home " to Roberta , Garp knew , was Dog 's Head Harbor . " She told me I was less sexually ambiguous than most people she knew , " Roberta said . " I really needed that , " she said , " because I had to use this horrible dilator all the time so that my vagina would n't close ; I felt like a machine . " Good old mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in what you write , " Roberta told him , suddenly . " But I do n't see that much sympathy in you , in your real life , " she said . It was the same thing Jenny had always accused him of . But now , he felt , he had more . With his jaw wired shut , with his wife with her arm in a sling all day  --  and Duncan with only half his pretty face intact  --  Garp felt more generous toward the other wretches who wandered into Dog 's Head Harbor . It was a summer town . Out of season , the bleached shingled house with its porches and garrets was the only occupied mansion along the gray-green dunes and the white beach at the end of Ocean Lane . An occasional dog sniffed through the bone-colored driftwood , and retired people , living some miles inland , in their former summer houses , occasionallystrolled the shore , scrutinizing the shells . In summer there were lots of dogs and children and mothers ' helpers all over the beach , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when the Garps moved in with Jenny , the shoreline seemed abandoned . The beach , littered with the debris washed in with the high tides of winter , was deserted . The Atlantic Ocean , through April and through May , was the livid color of a bruise -- was the color of the bridge of Helen 's nose . Visitors to the town , in the off-season , were quickly spotted as lost women in search of the famous nurse , Jenny Fields . In summer , these women often spent a whole day in Dog 's Head Harbor trying to find someone who knew where Jenny lived . But the permanent residents of Dog 's Head Harbor all knew : " The last house at the end of Ocean Lane , " they told the damaged girls and women who asked for directions . " It 's as big as a hotel , honey . You ca n't miss it . " Sometimes these searchers would trudge out to the beach first and view the house for a long time before they got up the nerve to come see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single or in twos and threes , squatting on the windy dunes and watching the house as if theyp274were trying to read the degree of sympathy therein . If there were more than one , they conferred on the beach ; one of them was elected to knock on the door while the others huddled on the dunes , like dogs told to stay ! until they 're called . Helen bought Duncan a telescope , and from his room with a sea view Duncan spied on the trepid visitors and often announced their presence hours before the knock on the door . " Someone for Grandma , " he 'd say . Focusing , always focusing . " She 's about twenty-four . Or maybe fourteen . She has a blue knapsack . She has an orange with her but I do n't think she 's going to eat it . Someone 's with her but I ca n't see her face . She 's lying down ; no , she 's being sick . No , she 's wearing a kind of mask . Maybe she 's the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a friend . " Now she 's eating the orange . It does n't look very good , " Duncan would report . And Roberta would look , too ; and sometimes Helen . It was often Garp who answered the door . " Yes , she 's my mother , " he 'd say , " but she 's out shopping right now . Please come in , if you want to wait for her . " And he would smile , though all the time he would be scrutinizing the person as carefully as the retired people along the beach looked at their seashells . And before his jaw healed , and his mauled tongue grew back together , Garp would answer the door with a ready supply of notes . Many of the visitors were not in the least surprised by being handed notes , because this was the only way they communicated , too . Hello , my name is Beth . I 'm an Ellen Jamesian . And Garp would give her his : Hello , my name is Garp . I have a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand them a second note , depending on the occasion . One said : There 's a nice fire in the wood stove in the kitchen ; turn left . And there was one that said : Do n't be upset . My mother will be back very soon . There are other women here . Would you like to see them ? It was in this period that Garp took to wearing a sport jacket again , not out of nostalgia for his days at Steering , or in Vienna  --  and certainly not out of any necessity to be well dressed at Dog 's Head Harbor , where Roberta seemed the only woman who was concerned with what she wore  --  but only because of his need for pockets ; he carried so many notes.  |p275He  tried running on the beach but he had to give it up ; it jarred his jaw and jangled his tongue against his teeth . But he walked for miles along the sand . He was returning from a walk the day the police car brought the young man to Jenny 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big front porch . " Mr. Garp ? " one of the policemen asked . Garp dressed in running gear for his walks ; he did n't have any notes on him , but he nodded , yes , he was Mr. Garp . " You know this kid ? " the policeman asked . " Of course he does , " the young man said . " You cops do n't ever believe anybody . You do n't know how to relax . " It was the kid in the purple caftan , the boy Garp had escorted from the boudoir of Mrs. Ralph  --  what seemed to Garp like years ago . Garp considered not recognizing him , but he nodded . " The kid 's got no money , " the policeman explained . " He does n't live around here , and he 's got no job . He 's not in school anywhere and when we called his folks , they said they did n't even know where he was  --  and they did n't sound very interested to find out . But he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for him . " Garp , of course , could n't speak . He pointed to his wire mesh and imitated the act of writing a note on his palm . " When 'd you get the braces ? " the kid asked . " Most people have them when they 're younger . They 're the craziest-looking braces I ever saw . " Garp wrote out a note on the back of a traffic violation form that the policeman handed him . Yes , I 'll take responsibility for him . But I ca n't speak up for him because I have a broken jaw . The kid read the note over the policeman 's shoulder . " Wow , " he said , grinning . " What happened to the other guy ? " He lost three quarters of his prick , Garp thought , but he did not write this on a traffic violation form , or on anything else . Ever . The boy turned out to have read Garp 's novels while he was in jail . " If I 'd known you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would never have been so disrespectful . " His name was Randy and he had become an ardent Garp fan . Garp was convinced that the mainstream of his fans consisted of waifs , lonely children , retarded grownups , cranks , and only occasional members of the citizenry who were not afflicted with perverted taste . But Randy had come to Garp as if Garp were now the only guru Randy obeyed . In the spirit of his mother 's home at Dog 's Head Harbor , Garp could n't very well turn the boy away . Roberta Muldoon took on the task of briefing Randy on the accident to ( carp and his family.  | " Who 's the great big lovely chick ? " Randy asked Garp in an awed whisper . Do n't you recognize her ? Garp wrote . She was a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles . But even Garp 's sourness could not dim Randy 's likable enthusiasm ; not right away . The boy entertained Duncan for hours . God knows how , Garp complained to Helen . He probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's not on anything , " Helen assured Garp . " Your mother asked him . " Then he relates to Duncan the exciting history of his criminalrecord , Garp wrote . " Randy wants to be a writer , " Helen said . Everyone wants to be a writer ! Garp wrote . But it was n't true . He did n't want to be a writer  --  not anymore . When he tried to write , only the deadliest subject rose up to greet him . He knew he had to forget it  --  not fondle it with his memory and exaggerate its awfulness with his art . That was madness , but whenever he thought of writing , his only subject greeted him with its leers , its fresh visceral puddles , and its stink of death . And so he did not write ; he did n't even try . At last Randy went away . Though Duncan was sorry to see him go , Garp felt relieved ; he did not show anybody else the note Randy left for him . I 'll never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's true , you could be a little more generous about how you rub that in . So I 'm not kind , Garp thought . What else is new ? He threw Randy 's note away . When the wires came off and the rawness left his tongue , Garp ran again . As the weather warmed up , Helen swam . She was told it was good for restoring her muscle tone and strengthening her collarbone , thoughp277this still hurt her  --  especially the breaststroke . She swam for what seemed to be miles , to Garp : straight out to sea , and then along the shoreline . She said she went out so far because the water was calmer there ; closer to shore , the waves interfered with her . But Garp worried . He and Duncan sometimes used the telescope to watch her . What am I going to do if somethinghappens ? Garp wondered . He was a poor swimmer . " Mom 's a good swimmer , " Duncan assured him . Duncan was also becoming a good swimmer . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the summer people arrived , the Garp family took its exercise in slightly less ostentatious ways ; they played on the beach or in the sea only in the early morning . In the crowded moments of the summer days , and in the early evenings , they watched the world from the shaded porches of Jenny Fields ' home ; they withdrew to the big cool house . Garp got a little better . He began to write  --  gingerly , at first : long plot outlines , and speculations about his characters . He avoided the main characters ; at least he thought they were the main characters  --  a husband , a wife , a child . He concentrated instead on a detective , an outsider to the family . Garp knew what terror would lurk at the heart of his book , and perhaps for that reason he approached it through a character as distant from his personal anxiety as the police inspector is distant from the crime . What business do I have writing about a police inspector ? he thought , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Garp stood close to the stink itself . The bandages came off Duncan 's eye hole and the boy wore a black patch , almost handsome against his summer tan . Garp took a deep breath and began a novel . It was in the late summer of Garp 's convalescence that The World According to Bensenhaver was begun . About that time , Michael Milton was released from a hospital , walking with a postsurgical stoop and a woebegone face . Due to an infection , the result of improper drainage  --  and aggravated by a common urological problem  --  he had to have the remaining quarter of his penis removed in an operation . Garp never knew this ; and at this point , it might not even have cheered him up . Helen knew Garp was writing again . " I wo n't read it , " she told him . " Not one word of it . I know you have to write it , but I never want to see it . I do n't mean to hurt you , but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to write about it , God help you . People bury these things in different ways . " " It 's not about it , ' exactly , " he told her . " I do not write autobiographicalfiction . " " I know that , too , " she said . " But I wo n't read it just the same . " " Of course , I understand , " he said . Writing , he always knew , was a lonely business . It was hard for ap278lonely thing to feel that much lonelier . Jenny , he knew , would read it ; she was tough as nails . Jenny watched them all get well ; she watched new patientscome and go . One was a hideous young girl named Laurel , who made the mistake of sounding off about Duncan one morning at breakfast . " Could I sleep in another part of the house ? " she asked Jenny . " There 's this creepy kid  --  with the telescope , the camera , and the eye patch ? He 's like a fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paw you over with their eyes  --  even with one eye . " Garp had fallen while running in the predawn light on the beach ; he had hurt his jaw again , and was  --  again  --  wired shut . He had no old notes handy for what he wanted to say to this girl , but he scribbled very hastily on his napkin . Fuck you , he scribbled , and threw the napkin at the surprised girl . " Look , " the girl said to Jenny , " this is just the kind of routine I had to get away from . Some man bullying me all the time , some ding-dong threatening me with his big-prick violence . Who needs it ? I mean , especiallyhere  --  who needs it ? Did I come here for more of the same ? " Fuck you to death , said Garp 's next note , but Jenny ushered the girl outside and told her the history of Duncan 's eye patch , and his telescope , and his camera , and the girl tried very hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her stay was just a few days , and then someone was there to get her : a sporty car with New York plates and a man who looked like a ding-dong  --  and someone who had , actually , threatened poor Laurel with " big-prick violence , " all the time . " Hey , you dildos ! " he called to Garp and Roberta , who were sitting on the large porch swing , like old-fashioned lovers . " Is this the whorehouse where you 're keeping Laurel ? " " We 're not exactly keeping ' her , " Roberta said . " Shut up , you big dyke , " said the New York man ; he came up on the porch . He 'd left the motor running to his sports car , and its idle charged and calmed itself  --  charged and calmed itself , and charged again . The man wore cowboy boots and green suede bell-bottom pants . He was tall and chesty , though not quite as tall and chesty as Roberta Muldoon . " I 'm not a dyke , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin either , " the man said . " Where the fuck is Laurel ? " He wore an orange T-shirt with bright green letters between his nipples.  |p279the  letters read . Garp searched his pockets for a pencil to scribble a note , but all he came up with was old notes : all the old standbys , which did not seem to apply to this rude person . " Is Laurel expecting you ? " Roberta Muldoon asked the man , and Garp knew that Roberta was having a sex-identity problem again ; she was goading the moron in hopes that she could then feel justified in beating the shit out of him . But the man , to Garp , looked as if he might make a fair match for Roberta . All that estrogen had changed more than Roberta 's shape , Garp thought  --  it had unmuscled the former Robert Muldoon , to a degree that Roberta seemed prone to forget . " Look , sweethearts , " the man said , to both Garp and Roberta . " If Laurel does n't get her ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of fag joint is this , anyway ? Everyone 's heard of it . I did n't have any trouble finding out where she went . Every screwy bitch in New York knows about this cunt hangout . " Roberta smiled . She was beginning to rock back and forth on the big porch swing in a way that was making Garp feel sick to his stomach . Garp clawed through his pockets at a frantic rate , scanning note after worthless note . " Look , you clowns , " the man said . " I know what sort of douche bags hang out here . It 's a big lesbian scene , right ? " He prodded the edge of the big porch swing with his cowboy boot and set the swing to moving oddly . " And what are you ? " he asked Garp . " You the man of the house ? Or the court eunuch ? " Garp handed the man a note . There 's a nice fire in the wood stove in the kitchen ; turn left . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this shit ? " the man said . And Garp handed him another note , the first one to fly out of his pocket . Do n't be upset . My mother will be back very soon . There are other women here . Would you like to see them ? " Fuck your mother ! " the man said . He started toward the big screen door . " Laurel ! " he screamed . " You in there ? You bitch ! " But it was Jenny Fields who met him in the doorway . " Hello , " she said . " I know who you are , " the man said . " I recognize the dumb uniform . My Laurel 's not your type , sweetie ; she likes to fuck . "  | " Perhaps not with you , " said Jenny Fields . Whatever abuse the man in the SHAPE UP ! T-shirt was then prepared to deliver to Jenny Fields went unsaid . Roberta Muldoon threw a crossbodyblock on the surprised man , hitting him from behind and a little to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flagrant clip , worthy of a fifteen-yard penalty in Roberta 's days as a Philadelphia Eagle . The man hit the gray boards of the porch deck with such force that the hanging flowerpots were set swinging . He tried but could not get up . He appeared to have suffered a knee injury common to the sport of football  --  the very reason , in fact , why clipping was a fifteen-yard penalty . The man was not plucky enough to hurl further abuse , at anyone , from his back ; he lay with a calm , moonlike expression upon his face , which whitened slightly in his pain . " That was too hard , Roberta , " Jenny said . " I 'll get Laurel , " Roberta said , sheepishly , and she went inside . In Roberta 's heart of hearts , Garp and Jenny knew , she was more feminine than anyone ; but in her body of bodies , she was a highly trained rock . Garp had found another note and he dropped it on the New York man 's chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note Garp had many duplicates of . Hello , my name is Garp . I have a broken jaw . " My name is Harold , " the man said . " Too bad about your jaw . " Garp found a pencil and wrote another note . Too bad about your knee , Harold . Laurel was fetched . " Oh , baby , " she said . " You found me ! " " I do n't think I can drive the fucking car , " Harold said . Out on Ocean Lane the man 's sport car still chugged like an animal interested in eating sand . " I can drive , baby , " Laurel said . " You just never let me . " " Now I 'll let you , " Harold groaned . " Believe me . " " Oh , baby , " Laurel said . Roberta and Garp carried the man to the car . " I think I really need Laurel , " the man confided to them . " Fucking bucket seats , " the man complained , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his car . It was the first time in what seemed like years , to Garp , that Garp had been this near to an automobile . Roberta put her hand on Garp 's shoulder , but Garp turned away . " I guess Harold needs me , " Laurel told Jenny Fields , and gave a little shrug.  | " But why does she need him ? " said Jenny Fields , to no one in particular , as the little car drove away . Garp had wandered off . Roberta , punishing herself for her momentarily lapsed femininity , went to find Duncanand mother him . Helen was talking on the phone to the Fletchers , Harrison and Alice , who wanted to come visit . That might help us , Helen thought . She was right , and it must have boosted Helen 's confidence in herself  --  to be right about something again . The Fletchers stayed a week . There was at last a child for Duncan to play with , even if it was not his age and not his sex ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , and Duncan lost most of his self-consciousnessabout the eye patch . When the Fletchers left , he was more willing to go to the beach by himself , even at those times of the day when he might encounter other children  --  who might ask him or , of course , tease him . Harrison provided Helen with a confidant , as he had been for her before ; she was able to tell Harrison things about Michael Milton that were simply too raw to tell Garp , and yet she needed to say them . She needed to talk about her anxieties for her marriage , now ; and how she was dealing with the accident so differently from Garp . Harrison suggested another child . Get pregnant , he advised . Helen confided that she was no longer taking the pills , but she did not tell Harrison that Garp had not slept with her  --  not since it had happened . She did n't really need to tell Harrison that ; Harrison noted the separate rooms . Alice encouraged Garp to stop the silly notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so vain about how he sounded . If she could talk , certainlyhe could spit the words out , Alice reasoned  --  teeth wired together , delicate tongue , and all ; he could at least try . " Alish , " Garp said . " Yeth , " said Alice . " That'th my name . What'th yours ? " " Arp , " Garp managed to say . Jenny Fields , passing whitely to another room , shuddered like a ghost and moved on . " I mish him , " Garp confessed to Alice . " You mith him , yeth , of courth you do , " said Alice , and she held him while he cried . It was quite some time after the Fletchers left when Helen came to Carp 's room in the night . She was not surprised to find him lying awake , because he was listening to what she 'd heard , too . It was why she could n't sleep . Someone , one of Jenny 's late arrivals  --  a new guest  --  was taking a bath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they 'd heardp282the plunking in the water  --  now the splashing and soapy sounds . There was even a little light singing , or the person was humming . They remembered , of course , the years Walt had washed himself within their hearing , how they would listen for any telltale slipping sounds , or for the most frightening sound of all  --  which was no sound . And then they 'd call , " Walt ? " And Walt would say , " What ? " And they would say , " Okay , just checking ! " To make sure that he had n't slipped under and drowned . Walt liked to lie with his ears underwater , listening to his fingers climbing the walls of the tub , and often he would n't hear Garp or Helen calling him . He 'd look up , surprised , to see their anxious faces suddenly above him , peering over the rim of the tub . " I 'm all right , " he 'd say , sitting up . " Just answer , for God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we call you , just answer us . " " I did n't hear you , " Walt said . " Then keep your head out of the water , " Helen said . " But how can I wash my hair ? " Walt asked . " That 's a lousy way to wash your hair , Walt , " Garp said . " Call me . I 'll wash your hair . " " Okay , " said Walt . And when they left him alone , he 'd put his head underwater again and listen to the world that way . Helen and Garp lay beside each other on Garp 's narrow bed in one of the guest rooms in one of the garrets at Dog 's Head Harbor . The house had so many bathrooms  --  they could n't even be sure which bathroom they were listening to , but they listened . " It 's a woman , I think , " Helen said . " Here ? " Garp said . " Of course it 's a woman . " " I thought at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , " Garp said . " The humming , I guess , " Helen said . " You know how he used to talk to himself ? " " I know , " Garp said . They held each other in the bed that was always a little damp , so close to the ocean and with so many windows open all day , and the screen doors swinging and banging . " I want another child , " said Helen . " Okay , " Garp said . " As soon as possible , " Helen said . " Right away , " said Garp . " Of course . " " If it 's a girl , " Helen said , " we 'll name her Jenny , because of your mother . " " Good , " said Garp.  | " I do n't know , if it 's a boy , " said Helen . " Not Walt , " Garp said . " Okay , " Helen said . " Not ever another Walt , " said Garp . " Although I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to , " Helen said . " Some other name , if it 's a boy , " Garp said . " I hope it 's a girl , " said Helen . " I wo n't care , " Garp said . " Of course . Neither will I , really , " said Helen . " I 'm so sorry , " Garp said ; he hugged her . " No , I 'm so sorry , " she said . " No , I 'm so sorry , " said Garp . " I am , " Helen said . " I am , " he said . They made love so carefully . Helen imagined that she was Roberta Muldoon , fresh out of surgery , trying out a brand-new vagina . Garp tried not to imagine anything . Whenever Garp began imagining , he only saw the bloody Volvo . There were Duncan 's screams , and outside he could hear Helen calling ; and someone else . He twisted himself from behind the steering wheel and kneeled on the driver 's seat ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood would not stop and Garp could n't see everything that was wrong . " It 's okay , " he whispered to Duncan . " Hush , you 're going to be all right . " But because of his tongue , there were no words  --  only a soft spray . Duncan kept screaming , and so did Helen , and someone else kept groaning  --  the way a dog dreams in its sleep . But what did Garp hear that frightened him so ? What else ? " It 's all right , Duncan , believe me , " he whispered , incomprehensibly . " You 're going to be all right . " He wiped the blood from the boy 's throat with his hand ; nothing at the boy 's throat was cut , he could see . He wiped the blood from the boy 's temples , and saw that they were not bashed in . He kicked open the driver's-side door , to be sure ; the door light went on and he could see that one of Duncan 's eyes was darting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the eye could see . He wiped more blood with his hand , but he could not find Duncan 's other eye . " It 's okay , " he whispered to Duncan , but Duncan screamed even louder . Over his father 's shoulder , Duncan had seen his mother at the Volvo 's open door . Blood streamed from her gashed nose and her sliced tongue , and she held her right arm as if it had broken off somewhere near her shoulder . But it was the fright in her face that frightened Duncan . Garp turned and saw her . Something else frightened him . It was not Helen 's screaming , it was not Duncan 's screaming . Andp284Garp knew that Michael Milton , who was grunting , could grunt himself to death  --  for all Garp cared . It was something else . It was not a sound . It was no sound . It was the absence of sound . " Where 's Walt ? " Helen said , trying to see into the Volvo . She stopped screaming . " Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan stopped crying . They heard nothing . And Garp knew Walt had a cold you could hear from the next room  --  even two rooms away , you could hear that wet rattle in the child 's chest . " Walt ! " they screamed . Both Helen and Garp would whisper to each other , later , that at that moment they imagined Walt with his ears underwater , listening intently to his fingers at play in the bathtub . " I can still see him , " Helen whispered , later . " All the time , " Garp said . " I know . " " I just shut my eyes , " said Helen . " Right , " Garp said . " I know . " But Duncan said it best . Duncan said that sometimes it was as if his missing right eye was not entirely gone . " It 's like I can still see out of it , sometimes , " Duncan said . " But it 's like memory , it 's not real  --  what I see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , " Garp told him . " Sort of , " Duncan said . " But it seems so real . " " It 's your imaginary eye , " Garp said . " That can be very real . " " It 's the eye I can still see Walt with , " Duncan said . " You know ? " " I know , " Garp said . Many wrestlers ' children have hardy necks , but not all the children of wrestlers have necks that are hardy enough . For Duncan and Helen , now , Garp seemed to have an endless reservoirof gentleness ; for a year , he spoke softly to them ; for a year , he was never impatient with them . They must have grown impatient with his delicacy . Jenny Fields noticed that the three of them needed a year to nurse each other . In that year , Jenny wondered , what did they do with the other feelings human beings have ? Helen hid them ; Helen was very strong . Duncan saw them only with his missing eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strong . He wrote a novel called The World According to Bensenhaver , into which all his other feelings flew . When Garp 's editor , John Wolf , read the first chapter of The World According to Bensenhaver , he wrote to Jenny Fields . " What in hell isp285going on out there ? " Wolf wrote to Jenny . " It is as if Garp 's grief has made his heart perverse . " But T. S. Garp felt guided by an impulse as old as Marcus Aurelius , who had the wisdom and the urgency to note that " in the life of a man , his time is but a moment . . . his sense a dim rushlight. "  |p286Ho|pe  Standish was at home with her son , Nicky , when Oren Rath walked into the kitchen . She was drying the dishes and she saw immediately the long , thin-bladed fisherman 's knife with the slick cutting edge and the special , saw-toothed edge that they call a disgorger-scaler . Nicky was not yet three ; he still ate in a high chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up behind him and nudged the ripper teeth of his fisherman 's knife against the child 's throat . " Set them dishes aside , " he told Hope . Mrs. Standish did as she was told . Nicky gurgled at the stranger ; the knife was just a tickle under his chin . " What do you want ? " Hope asked . " I 'll give you anything you want . " " You sure will , " said Oren Rath . " What 's your name ? " " Hope . " " Mine 's Oren . " " That 's a nice name , " Hope told him . Nicky could n't turn in the high chair to see the stranger who was tickling his throat . He had wet cereal on his fingers , and when he reached for Oren Rath 's hand , Rath stepped up beside the high chair and touched the fine , slicing edge of his fisherman 's blade to the fleshy pouch of the boy 's cheek . He made a quick cut there , as if he were briefly outlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe Nicky 's surprisedface , his simple cry ; a thread-thin line of blood appeared , like the stitching for a pocket , on the boy 's cheek . It was as if the child had suddenly developed a gill . " I mean business , " said Oren Rath . Hope started toward Nicky butp287Rath waved her back . " He do n't need you . He just do n't care for his cereal . He wants a cookie . " Nicky bawled . " He 'll choke on it , when he 's crying , " Hope said . " You want to argue with me ? " said Oren Rath . " You want to talk about choking ? I 'll cut his pecker off and stuff it down his throat  --  if you want to talk about choking . " Hope gave Nicky a zwieback and he stopped crying . " You see ? " said Oren Rath . He picked up the high chair with Nicky in it and hugged it to his chest . " We 're going to the bedroom now , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They went down the hall together . The Standish family lived in a ranch house then ; with a new baby , they had agreed that ranch houses were safer in the case of a fire . Hope went into the bedroom and Oren Rath put down the high chair with Nicky in it , just outside the bedroom door . Nicky had almost stopped bleeding ; there was just a little blood on his cheek ; Oren Rath wiped this off with his hand , then wiped his hand on his pants . Then he stepped into the bedroom after Hope . When he closed the door , Nicky started to cry . " Please , " Hope said . " He really might choke , and he knows how to get out of that high chair  --  or it might tip over . He does n't like to be alone . " Oren Rath went to the night table and slashed through the phone cord with his fisherman 's knife as easily as a man halving a very ripe pear . " You do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the bed . Nicky was crying , but not hysterically ; it sounded as if he might stop . Hope started crying , too . " Just take off your clothes , " Oren said . He helped her undress . He was tall and reddish-blond , his hair as lank and as close to his head as high grass beaten down by a flood . He smelled like silage and Hope remembered the turquoise pickup she 'd noticed in the driveway , just before he appeared in her kitchen . " You 've even got a rug in the bedroom , " he said to her . He was thin but muscular ; his hands were large and clumsy , like the feet of a puppy who 's going to be a big dog . His body seemed almost hairless , but he was so pale , so very blond , that his hair was hard to see against his skin . " Do you know my husband ? " Hope asked him . " I know when he 's home and when he ai n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hope held her breath . " You hear ? Your kid do n't even mind it . " Nicky was murmuring vowel sounds outside the bedroom door , talking wetly to his zwieback . Hope began crying harder . When Oren Rath touched her , awkward and fast , she thought she was so dry that she would n't even get big enough for his horrible finger.  | " Please wait , " she said . " No arguing with me . " " No , I mean I can help you , " she said . She wanted him in and out of her as fast as possible ; she was thinking of Nicky in the high chair in the hall . " I can make it nicer , I mean , " she said , unconvincingly ; she did not know how to say what she was saying . Oren Rath grabbed one of her breasts in such a way that Hope knew he had never touched a breast before ; his hand was so cold , she flinched . In his awkwardness , he butted her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No arguing , " he grunted . " Hope ! " someone called . They both heard it and froze . Oren Rath gaped at the cut phone cord . " Hope ? " It was Margot , a neighbor and a friend . Oren Rath touched the cool , flat blade of his knife to Hope 's nipple . " She 's going to walk right in here , " Hope whispered . " She 's a good friend . " " My God , Nicky , " they could hear Margot say , " I see you 're eating all over the house . Is your mother getting dressed ? " " " I 'll have to fuck you both and kill everybody , " whispered Oren Rath . Hope scissored his waist with her good legs and hugged him , knife and all , to her breasts . " Margot ! " she screamed . " Grab Nicky and run ! Please ! " she shrieked . " There 's a crazy man who 's going to kill us all ! Take Nicky , take Nicky ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time he 'd ever been hugged . He did not struggle , he did not use his knife . They both lay rigid and listened to Margot dragging Nicky down the hall and out the kitchen door . One leg of the high chair was snapped off against the refrigerator , but Margot did n't stop to remove Nicky from the chair until she was half a block down the street and kicking open her own door . " Do n't kill me , " Hope whispered . " Just go , quickly , and you 'll get away . She 's calling the police , right now . " " Get dressed , " said Oren Rath . " " I ai n't had you yet , and I 'm going to . " Where he 'd butted her with the oval crown of his head , he had split her lip against her teeth and made her bleed . " " I mean business , " he repeated , but uncertainly . He was as rough-boned and graceless as a young steer . He made her put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall , carrying his boots under his arm . Hope did n't realize until she was beside him in the pickup that he had put on one of her husband 's flannel shirts . " Margot has probably written down the license number of this truck , " she told him . She turned the rear-view mirror so that she couldp289see herself ; she dabbed at her split lip with the broad , floppy collar of her dress . Oren Rath stiff-armed her in the ear , rapping the far side of her head off the passenger door of the cab . " I need that mirror to see , " he said . " Do n't mess around or I 'll really hurt you . " He 'd taken her bra with him and he used it to tie her wrists to the thick , rusty hinges of the glove-compartment door , which gaped open at her . He drove as if he were in no special hurry to get out of town . He did not seem impatient when he got stuck at the long traffic light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street ; he shook his head and clucked his tongue when he saw how some of the students were dressed . Hope could see her husband 's office window from where she sat in the truck 's cab , but she did n't know if he would be in his office or actually , at that moment , teaching a class . In fact , he was in his office  --  four floors up . Dorsey Standish looked out his window and saw the lights change ; the traffic was allowed to flow , the hordes of marching students were temporarily restrained at the gates to the crosswalks . Dorsey Standish liked watching traffic . There are many foreign and flashy cars in a university town , but here these cars were contrasted with the vehicles of the natives : farmers ' trucks , slat-sided conveyors of pigs and cattle , strange harvesting machinery , everything muddy from the farms and county roads . Standish knew nothing about farms , but he was fascinated by the animals and the machines  --  especiallythe dangerous , baffling vehicles . There went one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a latticework of cables that pulled or suspended something heavy . Standish liked to try to visualize how everything worked . Below him a lurid turquoise pickup moved ahead with the traffic ; its fenders were pockmarked , its grille bashed in and black with mashed flies and Standish imagined  --  the heads of imbedded birds . In the cab beside the driver Dorsey Standish thought he saw a pretty woman  --  something about her hair and profile reminded him of Hope , and a flash of the woman 's dress struck him as a color his wife liked to wear . But he was four floors up ; the truck was past him , and the cab 's rear window was so thickly caked with mud that he could n't glimpse more of her . Besides , it was time for his nine-thirty class . Dorsey Standish decided it was unlikely that a woman riding in such an ugly truck would be at all pretty . " I bet your husband is screwing his students all the time , " said Oren Rath . His big hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I do n't think so , " Hope said . " Shit , you do n't know nothing , " he said . " I 'm going to fuck you so good you wo n't ever want it to stop . "  | " I do n't care what you do , " Hope told him . " You ca n't hurt my baby now . " " I can do things to you , " said Oren Rath . " Lots of things . " " Yes . You mean business , " Hope said , mockingly . They were driving into the farm country . Rath did n't say anything for a while . Then he said , " I 'm not as crazy as you think . " " I do n't think you 're crazy at all , " Hope lied . " I think you 're just a dumb , horny kid who 's never been laid . " Oren Rath must have felt at this moment that his advantage of terror was slipping away from him , fast . Hope was seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if Oren Rath was sane enough to be humiliated . They turned off the county road , up a long dirt driveway toward a farmhouse whose windows were blurred with plastic insulation ; the scruffy lawn was strewn with tractor parts and other metal trash . The mailbox said : R , R , W , E &; 0 RATH . These Raths were not related to the famous sausage Raths , but it appeared that they were pig farmers . Hope saw a series of outbuildings , gray and slanted with rusted roofs . On the ramp by the brown barn a full-grown sow lay on her side , breathing with difficulty ; beside the pig were two men who looked to Hope like mutants of the same mutation that had produced Oren Rath . " I want the black truck , now , " Oren said to them . " People are out looking for this one . " He used his knife matter-of-factly to slice through the bra that bound Hope 's wrists to the glove compartment . " Shit , " one of the men said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotch on his face  --  a kind of birthmark , which was the color and nubbled surface of a raspberry . In fact , that is what his family called him : Raspberry Rath . Fortunately , Hope did n't know this . They had not looked at Oren or at Hope . The hard-breathing sow shattered the barnyard calm with a rippling fart . " Shit , there she goes again , " the man without the birthmark said ; except for his eyes , his face was more or less normal . His name was Weldon . Raspberry Rath read the label on a brown bottle he held out toward the pig like a drink : " ' May produce excessive gas and flatulence , ' it says . " " Do n't say anything about producing a pig like this , " Weldon said . " I need the black truck , " Oren said . " Well , the key 's in it , Oren , " said Weldon Rath . " If you think you can manage by yourself . " Oren Rath shoved Hope toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine and staring at Hope when she said to him , " He 's kidnapping me . He 's going to rape me . The police are already looking for him . " Raspberry kept staring at Hope , but Weldon turned to Oren . " I hope you ai n't doing nothing too stupid , " he said . " I ai n't , " Oren said . The two men now turned their total attention to the pig . " I 'd wait another hour and then give her another squirt , " Raspberry said . " Ai n't we seen enough of the vet this week ? " He scratched the mud-smeared neck of the sow with the toe of his boot ; the sow farted . Oren led Hope behind the barn where the corn spilled out of the silo . Some piglets , barely bigger than kittens , were playing in it . They scattered when Oren started the black pickup . Hope started to cry . " Are you going to let me go ? " she asked Oren . " I ai n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were cold and black with the spring muck . " My feet hurt , " she said . " Where are we going ? " She 'd seen an old blanket in the back of the pickup , matted and flecked with straw . That 's where she imagined she was going : into the cornfields , then spread on the spongy spring ground  --  and when it was over and her throat was slit , and she 'd been disemboweled with the fisherman 's knife , he 'd wrap her up in the blanket that was lumped stiffly on the floor of the pickup as if it covered some stillborn livestock . " I got to find a good place to have you , " said Oren Rath . " I would of kept you at home , but I 'd of had to share you . " Hope Standish was trying to figure out the foreign machinery of Oren Rath . He did not work like the human beings she was accustomed to . " What you 're doing is wrong , " she said . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't . " " You 're going to rape me , " Hope said . " That 's wrong . " " I just want to have you , " he said . He had n't bothered to tie her to the glove compartment this time . There was nowhere she could go . They were driving only on those mile-long plots of county roads , driving slowly west in little squares , the way a knight advances on a chessboard : one square ahead , two sideways , one sideways , two ahead . It seemed purposeless to Hope , but then she wondered if he did n't know the roads so very well that he knew how to cover a considerable distancewithout ever passing through a town . They saw only the signposts for towns , and although they could n't have moved more than thirty miles from the university , she did n't recognize any of the names : Coldwater , Hills , Fields , Plainview . Maybe they are n't towns , she thought , but onlyp292crude labels for the natives who lived here  --  identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the simple words for the things they saw every day . " You do n't have any right to do this to me , " Hope said . " Shit , " he said . He pumped his brakes hard , throwing her forward against the truck 's solid dashboard . Her forehead bounced off the windshield , the back of her hand was mashed against her nose . She felt something like a small muscle or a very light bone give way in her chest . Then he tromped on the accelerator and tossed her back into the seat . " I hate arguing , " he said . Her nose bled ; she sat with her head forward , in her hands , and the blood dripped on her thighs . She sniffed a little ; the blood dripped over her lip and filmed her teeth . She tipped her head back so that she could taste it . For some reason , it calmed her  --  it helped her to think . She knew there was a rapidly blueing knot on her forehead , swelling under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face and touched the lump , Oren Rath looked at her and laughed . She spit at him  --  a thin phlegm laced pink with blood . It caught his cheek and ran down to the collar of her husband 's flannel shirt . His hand , as flat and broad as the sole of a boot , reached for her hair . She grabbed his forearm with both her hands , she jerked his wrist to her mouth and bit into the soft part where the hairs do n't always grow and the blue tubes carry the blood . She meant to kill him in this impossible way but she barely had time to break the skin . His arm was so strong that he snapped her body upright and across his lap . He pushed the back of her neck against the steering wheel  --  the horn blew through her head  --  and he broke her nose with the heel of his left hand . Then he returned that hand to the wheel . He cradled her head with his right hand , holding her face against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he let her head rest on his thigh . His hand lightly cupped her ear , as if to hold the sound of the horn inside her . She kept her eyes shut against the pain in her nose . He made several left turns , more right turns . Each turn , she knew , meant they had driven one mile . His hand now cupped the back of her neck . She could hear again , and she felt his fingers working their way into her hair . The front of her face felt numb . " I do n't want to kill you , " he said . " Do n't , then , " Hope said . " Got to , " Oren Rath told her . " After we do it , I 'll have to . " This affected her like the taste of her own blood . She knew he did n't care for arguing . She saw that she had lost a step : her rape . He was going to do it to her . She had to consider that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that meant outliving him . She knew that meant getting him caught , or getting him killed , or killing him . Against her cheek , she felt the change in his pocket ; his blue jeans were soft and sticky with farm dust and machine grease . His belt buckle dug into her forehead ; her lips touched the oily leather of his belt . The fisherman 's knife was kept in a sheath , she knew . But where was the sheath ? She could n't see it ; she did n't dare to hunt for it with her hands . Suddenly , against her eye , she felt his penis stiffening . She felt then  --  for really the first time  --  almost paralyzed , panicked beyond helping herself , no longer able to sort out the priorities . Once again , it was Oren Rath who helped her . " Look at it this way , " he said . " Your kid got away . I was going to kill the kid , too , you know . " The logic of Oren Rath 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard the other cars . There were not many , but every few minutes or so there was a car passing . She wished she could see , but she knew they were not as isolated as they had been . Now , she thought , before he gets to where we 're going  --  if he even knows where we 're going . She thought he did . At least , before he gets off this road  --  before I 'm somewhere , again , where there are n't any people . Oren Rath shifted in his seat . His erection was making him uncomfortable . Hope 's warm face in his lap , his hand in her hair , was reaching him . Now , Hope thought . She moved her cheek against his thigh , just slightly ; he did not stop her . She moved her face in his lap as if she were making herself more comfortable , against a pillow  --  against his prick , she knew . She moved until the bulge under his rank pants rose untouched by her face . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of his lap near her mouth , and she began to breathe on it . It hurt too much to breathe out of her nose . She drew her lips into an 0-shaped kiss , she focused her breathing , and , very softly , she blew . Oh , Nicky , she thought . And Dorsey , her husband . She would see them again , she hoped . To Oren Rath she gave her warm , careful breath . On him she focused her one , cold thought : I 'm going to get you , you son of a bitch . It was apparent that the sexual experience of Oren Rath had not previously involved such subtleties as Hope 's directed breathing . He tried to move her head in his lap so that he would once again have contact with her hot face , but at the same time he did n't want to disturb her soft breath . What she was doing made him want more contact , butp294it was excruciating to imagine losing the teasing contact he now had . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement that finally brought the bulge of sour jeans to touch her lips . She closed them there , but did n't move her mouth . Oren Rath felt only a hot wind passing through the crude weave of his clothes ; he groaned . A car approached , then passed him ; he corrected the truck . He was aware he was beginning to wander across the center of the road . " What are you doing ? " he asked Hope . She , very lightly , applied her teeth to his swollen clothes . He brought his knee up , pumped the brake , jarred her head , hurt her nose . He forced his hand between her face and his lap . She thought he was going to really hurt her but he was struggling with his zipper . " I 've seen pictures of this , " he told her . " Let me , " she said . She had to sit up just a little to get his fly open . She wanted to get a look at where they were ; they were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted lines on the road . She took him out of his pants and into her mouth without looking at him . " Shit , " he said . She thought she would gag ; she was afraid she would be sick . Then she got him into the back of her cheek where she thought she could take a lot of time . He was sitting so stiffly still , but trembling , that she knew he was already far beyond even his imaginary experiences . That steadied Hope ; it gave her confidence , and a sense of time . She went ahead with it very slowly , listening for other cars . She could tell he had slowed down . At the first sign she had that he was leaving this road , she would have to change her plans . Could I bite the damn thing off ? she wondered . But she thought that she probably could n't  --  at least , not quickly enough . Then two trucks went by them , closely following each other ; in the distance she thought she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raised his lap higher . She thought their truck had speeded up . A car passed them  --  awfully close , she thought . Its horn blared at them . " Fuck you ! " Oren Rath yelled after it ; he was beginning to jounce up and down in the seat , hurting Hope 's nose . Hope now had to be careful not to hurt him ; she wanted to hurt him very much . Just make him lose his head , she encouraged herself . Suddenly there was the sound of gravel spraying the underside of the truck . She closed her mouth fast around him . But they were neither crashing nor turning off the road ; he was pulling abruptly to the roadside and stopping . The truck stalled out . He put both his hands on either side of her face ; his thighs hardened and slapped against her jaw . I 'm going to choke on it , she thought , but he was lifting her face up , out of his lap . " No ! No ! " he cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut into his words . " I do n't have the thing on , " he said to her . " If you have any germs , they 'll swim right up me. "  |p295Ho|pe  sat on her knees , her lips hot and sore , her nose throbbing . He was going to put on a rubber , but when he tore it from its little tinfoil package , he stared at it as if it was n't at all what he expected to see  --  as if he thought they were bright green ! As if he did n't know how to put it on . " Take your dress off , " he said ; he was embarrassed that she was looking at him . She could see the cornfields on either side of the road , and the back side of a billboard a few yards away from them . But there were no houses , no signs , no intersecting roads . No cars and trucks were coming . She thought her heart would simply stop . Oren Rath tore himself out of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope saw it flap in the road . He scraped his boots off on the brake pedal , whacking his narrow blond knees on the steering wheel . " Shove over ! " he said . She was wedged against the passenger-side door . She knew  --  even if she could get out the door  --  that she could n't outrunhim . She did n't have any shoes  --  and his feet appeared to have a dog 's rough pads . He was having trouble with his pants ; he clutched the rolled-up rubber in his teeth . Then he was naked  --  he 'd flung his pants somewhere and he shoved the rubber down over himself as if his penis were no more sensitive than a turtle 's leathery tail . She was trying to unbutton her dress and her tears were coming back , though she was fighting them , when he suddenly caught her dress and began to yank it over her head ; it caught on her arms . He jerked her elbows painfully behind her back . He was too long to fit in the cab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle over her head but he bit her in the neck . " No ! " he hollered . He thrashed his feet around  --  she saw his shin was bleeding ; he 'd cut it on the rim of the horn  --  and his hard heels struck the door handle on the driver 's side . With both feet , he launched the door open . She saw the gray smear of the road over his shoulder  --  his long ankles stuck out into the traffic lane , but there was no traffic now . Her head hurt ; she was jammed against the door . She had to wriggle herself back down the seat , farther under him , and her movement made him yell something unintelligible . She felt his rubbered prick slipping over her stomach . Then his whole body braced and he bit into her shoulder fiercely . He 'd come ! " Shit ! " he cried . " I done it already ! " " No , " she said , hugging him . " No , you can do more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , he would kill her . " Much more , " she said in his ear , which smelled like dust . She had to wet her fingers to wet herself . God , I 'll never get him inside me , she thought , but when she found him with her hand , she knew that the rubber was the lubricated kind.  | " Oh , " he said . He lay still on top of her ; he seemed surprised by where she 'd put him , as if he did n't really know what was where . " Oh , " he repeated . Oh , what now ? Hope wondered . She held her breath . A car , a flash of red , whined past their open door  --  the horn blast and some muffled , derisive hoots fading away from them . Of course , she thought : we look like two farmers fucking off the side of the road ; it 's probably done all the time . No one will stop , she thought , unless it 's the police . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing out a ticket . " Not on the road , buddy , " he 'd be saying . And when she screamed at him , " Rape ! He 's raping me , " the trooper would wink at Oren Rath . The bewildered Rath seemed to be feeling rather cautiously for something inside her . If he 's just come , Hope thought , how much time do I have before he comes again ? But he seemed more like a goat than a human to her , and the babylike gurgle in his throat , hot against her ear , seemed close to the last sound she imagined she 'd hear . She looked at everything she could see . The keys dangling from the ignition were too far to reach ; and what could she do with a set of keys ? Her back hurt and she pushed her hand against the dashboard to try to shift his weight on her ; this excited him and made him grunt against her . " Do n't move , " he said ; she tried to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approvingly . " That 's real good . I 'll kill you quick . You wo n't even know it . You just do like that , and I 'll kill you good . " Her hand grazed a metal button , smooth and round ; her fingers touched it and she did not even have to turn her face away from him and look at it to know what it was . It opened the glove compartment and she pushed it . The spring-release door was a sudden weight in her hand . She said a long and loud " Aaahhh ! " to conceal the sound of the things in the glove compartment that rattled around . Her hand touched cloth , her fingers felt grit . There was a spool of wire , something sharp , but too small  --  things like screws and nails , a bolt , perhaps a hinge to something else . There was nothing she could use . Reaching around in there was hurting her arm ; she let her hand trail to the floor of the cab . When anothertruck passed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign of even slowing down for a better look  --  she started to cry . " I got to kill you , " Rath moaned . " Have you done this before ? " she asked him . " Sure , " he said , and he thrust into her  --  stupidly , as if his brute lunges could impress her . " And did you kill them , too ? " Hope asked . Her hand , aimless now , toyed with something  --  some material  --  on the floor of the cab . " They were animals , " Rath admitted . " But I had to kill them , too . "  |p297Ho|pe  sickened , her fingers clutched the thing on the floor  --  an old jacket or something . " Pigs ? " she asked him . " Pigs ! " he cried . " Shit , nobody fucks pigs , " he told her . Hope thought that probably somebody did . " They was sheep , " Rath said . " And one calf . " But this was hopeless , she knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She choked a sob that felt like it would split her head if it ever escaped her . " Please try to be kind to me , " Hope said . " Do n't talk any , " he said . " Move like you did . " She moved , but apparently not the right way . " No ! " he shouted . His fingers dug into her spine . She tried moving another way . " Yup , " he said . He moved , now , determined and purposeful  --  mechanical and dumb . Oh , God , Hope thought . Oh , Nicky . And Dorsey . Then she felt what she held in her hand : his pants . And her fingers , suddenly as wise as a Braille reader 's , located the zipper and moved on ; her fingers passed over the change in the pocket , they slipped around the wide belt . " Yup , yup , yup , " said Oren Rath . Sheep , Hope thought to herself ; and one calf . " Oh , please concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk ! " said Oren Rath . But now her hand held it : the long , hard , leather sheath . That is the little hook , her fingers told her , and that is the little metal clasp . And that  --  oh , yes !  --  is the head of the thing , the bony handle of the fisherman'sknife he had used to cut her son . Nicky 's cut was not serious . In fact , everyone was trying to figure out how he got it . Nicky was not talking yet . He enjoyed looking in the mirror at the thin , half-moon slit that was already closed . " Must have been something very sharp , " the doctor told the police . Margot , the neighbor , had thought she 'd better call a doctor , too ; she 'd found blood on the child 's bib . The police had found more blood in the bedroom ; a single drop on the cream-white bedspread . They were puzzledabout it ; there was no other sign of violence , and Margot had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blood was from Hope 's split lip  --  from the time Oren Rath had butted her  --  but there was no way any of them could know that . Margot thought there might have been sex , but she was n't suggesting it . Dorsey Standish was too shocked to think . The police did not think there had been time for sex . The doctor knew no blow had been connected with Nicky 's cut  --  probably not even a fall . " A razor ? " he suggested . " Or a very sharp knife . "  |p298The  police inspector , a solidly round and florid man , a year away from his retirement , found the cut phone cord in the bedroom . " A knife , " he said . " A sharp knife with some weight to it . " His name was Arden Bensenhaver , and he had once been a police superintendent in Toledo , but his methods had been judged as unorthodox . He pointed at Nicky 's cheek . " " It 's a flick wound , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see many flick knives around here , " Bensenhaver told them . " It 's a flick-type of wound , but it 's probably some kind of hunting or fishing knife . " Margot had described Oren Rath as a farm kid in a farm truck , except that the truck 's color revealed the unnatural influence of the town and the university upon the farmers : turquoise . Dorsey Standish did not even associate this with the turquoise truck he had seen , or the woman in the cab whom he 'd thought had resembled Hope . He still did n't understand anything . " Did they leave a note ? " he asked . Arden Bensenhaver stared at him . The doctor looked down at the floor . " You know , about a ransom ? " Standish said . He was a literal man struggling for a literal hold . Someone , he thought , had said " kidnap " ; was n't there ransom in the case of kidnap ? " There 's no note , Mr. Standish , " Bensenhaver told him . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were in the bedroom when I found Nicky outside the door , " Margot said . " But she was all right when she left , Dorsey . I saw her . " They had n't told Standish about Hope 's panties , discarded on the bedroom floor ; they 'd been unable to find the matching bra . Margot had told Arden Bensenhaver that Mrs. Standish was a woman who usually wore a bra . She had left barefoot ; they knew that , too . And Margot had recognized Dorsey 's shirt on the farm kid . She 'd got only a partial readingof the license plate ; it was an in-state , commercial plate , and the first two numbers placed it within the county , but she had n't gotten them all . The rear plate had been spattered with mud , the front plate was missing . " We 'll find them , " Arden Bensenhaver said . " There 's not much in the way of turquoise trucks around here . The county sheriff 's boys will probably know it . " " Nicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat him on his lap . " What happened to Mommy ? " The child pointed out the window . " So he was going to rape her ? " Dorsey Standish asked them all . Margot said , " Dorsey , let 's wait until we know . " " Wait ? " Standish said . " You got to excuse me asking you , " said Arden Bensenhaver , " but your wife was n't seeing anybody , was she ? You know . " Standish was mute at the question , but it seemed as if he were im/portantly considering it . " No , she was n't , " Margot told Bensenhaver . " Absolutely not . " " I got to ask Mr. Standish , " Bensenhaver said . " God , " Margot said . " No , I do n't think she was , " Standish told the inspector . " Of course she was n't , Dorsey , " Margot said . " Let 's go take Nicky for a walk , " she said to him . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was in and out of the house five times a day ; she was always in the process of finishing something . Twice a year she had her phone disconnected , and connected again ; it was like trying to stop smoking is for some people . Margot had children of her own but they were older  --  they were in school all day  --  and she often watched Nicky so that Hope could do something by herself . Dorsey Standish took Margot for granted ; although he knew she was a kind and generous person , those were not qualities that especially arrested his attention . Margot , he realized now , was n't especially attractive , either . She was not sexually attractive , he thought , and a bitter feeling rose up in Standish : he thought that no one would ever try to rape Margot  --  whereas Hope was a beautiful woman , anyone could see . Anyone would want her . Dorsey Standish was all wrong about that ; he did n't know the first thing about rape  --  that the victim hardly ever matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force sex on almost anyone imaginable . Very small children , very old people , even dead people ; also animals . Inspector Arden Bensenhaver , who knew a good deal about rape , announced that he had to get on with his job . Bensenhaver felt better with lots of open space around him . His first employment had been the nighttime beat in a squad car , cruising old Route 2 between Sandusky and Toledo . In the summers it was a road speckled with beer joints and little homemade signs promising BOWLING ! POOL ! SMOKED FISH ! and LIVE BAIT ! And Arden Bensenhaver would drive slowly over Sandusky Bay and along Lake Erie to Toledo , waiting for the drunken carfuls of teen-agers and fishermen to play chicken with him on that unlit , two-lane road . Later , when he was the police superintendent of Toledo , Bensenhaver would be driven , in the daytime , over that harmless stretch of road . The bait shops and beer palaces and fast-food services looked so exposed in the daylight . It was like watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick neck , the dense chest , the wristless arms  --  and then , when the last shirt was off , you saw the sad , helpless paunch . Arden Bensenhaver hated the night . Bensenhaver 's big plea with the city government of Toledo had been for better lighting on Saturdayp300nights . Toledo was a workingman 's city , and Bensenhaver believed that if the city could afford to light itself , brightly , on Saturday night , half the gashings and maimings  --  the general bodily abusings  --  would stop . But Toledo had thought the idea was dim . Toledo was as unimpressed with Arden Bensenhaver 's ideas as it was questioning of his methods . Now Bensenhaver relaxed in all this open country . He had a perspectiveon the dangerous world that he always wanted to have : he was circling the flat , open land in a helicopter  --  above it all , the detached overseer observing his contained , well-lit kingdom . The county deputy said to him , " There 's only one truck around here that 's turquoise . It 's those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's a whole family of them , " the deputy said . " I hate going out there . " " Why ? " Bensenhaver asked ; below him , he watched the shadow of the helicopter cross a creek , cross a road , move alongside a field of corn and a field of soybeans . " They 're all weird , " the deputy said . Bensenhaver looked at him  --  a young man , puffy-faced and small-eyed , but pleasant ; his long hair hung in a hunk under his tight hat , almost touching his shoulders . Bensenhaverthought of all the football players who wore their hair spilling out under ' their helmets . They could braid it , some of them , he thought . Now even lawmen looked like this . He was glad he was retiring soon ; he could n't understand why so many people wanted to look the way they did . " ' Weird ' ? " said Bensenhaver . Their language was all the same , too , he thought . They used just four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complaint about the younger one just last week , " the deputy said . Bensenhaver noted this casual use of " I "  --  as in " I got a complaint "  --  when in fact Bensenhaver knew that the sheriff , or his office , would have received the complaint , and that the sheriff probably thought it was simple enough to send this young deputy out on it . But why did they give me such a young one for this ? Bensenhaver wondered . " The youngest brother 's name is Oren , " the deputy said . " They all have weird names , too . " " What was the complaint ? " Bensenhaver asked ; his eyes followed a long dirt driveway to what appeared to be a random dropping of barns and outbuildings , one of which he knew was the main farmhouse , where the people lived . But Arden Bensenhaver could n't tell which one that might be . To him , all the buildings looked vaguely unfit for animals . " Well , " the deputy said , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " ' Screwing around ' ? " Bensenhaver asked patiently . That could mean anything , he thought . " " Well , " the deputy said , " the people whose dog it was thought that Oren was trying to fuck it . " " Was he ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Probably , " the deputy said , " but I could n't tell anything . When I got there , Oren was n't around  --  and the dog looked all right . I mean , how could I tell if the dog had been fucked ? " " Should 've asked it ! " said the copter pilot  --  a kid , Bensenhaver realized , even younger than the deputy . Even the deputy looked at him with contempt . " One of these half-wits the National Guard gives us , " the deputy whispered to Bensenhaver , but Bensenhaver had spotted the turquoise truck . It was parked out in the open , alongside a low shed . No attempt had been made to conceal it . In a long pen a tide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hovering helicopter . Two lean men in overalls squatted over a pig that lay sprawled at the foot of a ramp to a barn . They looked up at the helicopter , shielding their faces from the stinging dirt . " Not so close . Put it down over on the lawn , " Bensenhaver told the pilot . " " You 're scaring the animals . " " I do n't see Oren , or the old man , " the deputy said . " There 's more of them than those two . " " You ask those two where Oren is , " Bensenhaver said . " I want to look at that truck . " The men obviously knew the deputy ; they hardly watched him approach . But they watched Bensenhaver , in his dull dun-colored suit and tie , crossing the barnyard toward the turquoise pickup . Arden Bensenhaverdid n't look at them , but he could see them just the same . They are morons , he thought . Bensenhaver had seen all kinds of bad men in Toledo  --  vicious men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves , men who murdered for money , and men who murderedfor sex . But Bensenhaver had not seen quite such benign corruptionas he thought he saw on the faces of Weldon and Raspberry Rath . It gave him a chill . He thought he 'd better find Mrs. Standish , quickly . He did n't know what he was looking for when he opened the door of the turquoise pickup , but Arden Bensenhaver knew how to look for unknowns . He saw it imme'i tely -- it was easy : the slashed bra , a piece of it still tied to the hinge of the glove-compartment door ; the other two pieces were on the floor . There was no blood ; the bra was a soft , natural beige ; very classy , Arden Bensenhaver thought . He had no style himself , but he 'd seen dead people of all kinds , and he could recognizep302something of a person 's style in the clothes . He put the pieces of the silky bra into one hand ; then he put both hands into the floppy , stretched pockets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy , who was talking to the Rath brothers . " They have n't seen the kid all day , " the deputy told Bensenhaver . " They say Oren sometimes stays away overnight . " " Ask them who 's the last one who drove that truck , " Bensenhaver said to the deputy ; he would n't look at the Raths ; he treated them as if they could n't possibly understand him , directly . " I already asked them that , " the deputy said . " They say they do n't remember . " " Ask them when 's the last time a pretty young woman rode in that truck , " Bensenhaver said , but the deputy did n't have time ; Weldon Rath laughed . Bensenhaver felt grateful that the one with the blotch on his face , like a wine spill , had kept quiet . " Shit , " Weldon said . " There 's no ' pretty young woman ' around here , no pretty young woman ever sat her ass in that truck . " " Tell him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liar . " " You 're a liar , Weldon , " the deputy said . Raspberry Rath said to the deputy , " Shit , who is he , coming in here , telling us what to do ? " Arden Bensenhaver took the three pieces of the bra from his pocket . He looked at the sow lying beside the men ; she had one frightened eye , which appeared to be looking at all of them at once , and it was hard to tell where her other eye was looking . " Is that a boy pig or a girl pig ? " asked Bensenhaver . The Raths laughed . " Anyone can see it 's a sow , " Raspberry said . " Do you ever cut the balls off the boy pigs ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Do you do that yourselves or do you have others do it for you ? " " We castrate them ourselves , " said Weldon . He looked a little likea boar himself , with wild tufts of hair sprouting upward , out of his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to it . " " Well , " said Bensenhaver , holding up the bra for them and the deputyto see . " Well , that 's exactly what the new law provides for  --  in the case of these sexual crimes . " Neither the deputy nor the Raths spoke . " Any sexual crime , " Bensenhaver said , " is now punishable by castration . If you fuck anybody you should n't , " said Bensenhaver , " or if you assist in the act of getting a person fucked  --  by not helping us to stop it  --  then we can castrate you . " Weldon Rath looked at his brother , Raspberry , who looked a little puzzled . But Weldon leered at Bensenhaver and said , " You do it yourselvesor do you have others do it for you ? " He nudged his brother . Raspberry tried to grin , pulling his birthmark askew.  |p303But  Bensenhaver was deadpan , turning the bra over and over in his hands . " Of course we do n't do it , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Guard does it . That 's why we got the National Guard helicopter . We just fly you right out to the National Guard hospital and fly you right back home again . There 's nothing to it , " he said . " As you know . " " We have a big family , " Raspberry Rath said . " There 's a lot of us brothers . We do n't know from one day to the next who 's riding around in what truck . " ' " There 's another truck ? " Bensenhaver asked the deputy . " You did n't tell me there was another truck . " " Yeah , it 's black . I forgot , " the deputy said . They have a black one , too . " The Raths nodded . " Where is it ? " Bensenhaver asked . He was contained but tense . The brothers looked at each other . Weldon said , " I have n't seen it in a while . " " Might be that Oren has it , " said Raspberry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Weldon said . " We do n't have time for this shit , " Bensenhaver told the deputy , sharply . " We 'll find out what they weigh  --  then see if the pilot can carry them . " The deputy , thought Bensenhaver , is almost as much of a moron as the brothers . " Go on ! " Bensenhaver said to the deputy . Then , with impatience , he turned to Weldon Rath . " Name ? " he asked . " Weldon , " Weldon said . " Weight ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Weight ? " said Weldon . " What do you weigh ? " Bensenhaver asked him . " If we 're going to lug you off in the copter , we got to know what you weigh . " " One-eighty-something , " Weldon said . " You ? " Bensenhaver asked the younger one . " One-ninety-something , " he said . " My name 's Raspberry . " Bensenhavershut his eyes . " That 's three-seventy-something , " Bensenhaver told the deputy . " Go ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not taking us anywhere , now , are you ? " Weldon asked . " We 'll just take you to the National Guard hospital , " Bensenhaver said . " Then if we find the woman , and she 's all right , we 'll take you home . " " But if she ai n't all right , we get a lawyer , right ? " Raspberry asked Bensenhaver . " One of those people in the courts , right ? " " If who ai n't all right ? " Bensenhaver asked him . " Well , this woman you 're looking for , " Raspberry said . " Well , if she 's not all right , " Bensenhaver said , " then we already gotp304you in the hospital and we can castrate you and send you back home the same day . You boys know more about what 's involved than I do , " he admitted . " I 've never seen it done , but it does n't take long , does it ? And it does n't bleed much , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer ! " Raspberry said . " Of course there is , " Weldon said . " Shut up . " " No , no more courts for this kind of thing  --  not with the new law , " Bensenhaver said . " Sex crimes are special , and with the new machines , it 's just so easy to castrate someone that it makes the most sense . " " Yeah ! " the deputy hollered from the helicopter . " The weight 's okay . We can take them . " " Shit ! " Raspberry said . " Shut up , " said Weldon . " They 're not cutting my balls off ! " Raspberry yelled at him . " I did n't even get to have her ! " Weldon hit Raspberry so hard in the stomach that the younger man pitched over sideways and landed on the prostrate pig . It squealed , its short legs spasmed , it evacuated suddenly , and horribly , but otherwise it did n't move . Raspberry lay gasping beside the sow 's stenchful waste , and Arden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weldon was too quick , though ; he caught Bensenhaver'sleg at the knee and tossed the old man over backwards , over Raspberry and the poor pig . " Goddamnit , " Bensenhaver said . The deputy drew his gun and fired one shot in the air . Weldon dropped to his knees , holding his ears . " You all right , Inspector ? " the deputy asked . " Yes , of course I am , " Bensenhaver said . He sat beside the pig and Raspberry . He realized , without the smallest touch of shame , that he felt toward them more or less equally . " Raspberry , " he said ( the name itself made Bensenhaver close his eyes ) , " if you want to keep your balls on , you tell us where the woman is . " The man 's birthmark flashed at Bensenhaverlike a neon sign . " You keep still , Raspberry , " Weldon said . And Bensenhaver told the deputy , " If he opens his mouth again , shoot his balls off , right here . Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the deputy was not so stupid that he would actually do it . " Oren 's got her , " Raspberry told Bensenhaver . " He took the black truck . " " Where 'd he take her ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Do n't know , " Raspberry said . " He took her for a ride . " " Was she all right when she left here ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Well , she was all right , I guess , " Raspberry said . " I mean , I do n't think Oren had hurt her yet . I do n't think he 'd even had her yet . "  | " Why not ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Well , if he 'd already had her , " Raspberry said , " why would he want to keep her ? " Bensenhaver again shut his eyes . He got to his feet . " Find out how long ago , " he told the deputy . " Then fuck up that turquoise truck so they ca n't drive it . Then get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave them here ? " the deputy asked . " Sure , " Bensenhaver said . " There 'll be plenty of time to cut their balls off , later . " Arden Bensenhaver had the pilot send a message that the abductor 's name was Oren Rath , and that he was driving a black , not a turquoise , pickup . This message meshed interestingly with another one : a state trooper had received a report that a man all alone in a black pickup had been driving dangerously , wandering in and out of his rightful driving lane , " looking like he was drunk , or stoned , or something else . " The trooper had not followed this up because , at the time , he 'd thought he was supposed to be more concerned about a turquoise pickup . Arden Bensenhaver , of course , could n't know that the man in the black pickup had n't really been alone  --  that , in fact , Hope Standish had been lying with her head in his lap . The news simply gave Bensenhaver another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already done something to the woman . Bensenhaver yelled to the deputy to hurry over to the copterthatthey were looking for a black pickup that had last been seen on the bypass that intersects the system of county roads near the town called Sweet Wells . " Know it ? " Bensenhaver asked . " Oh , yeah , " the deputy said . They were in the air again , below them the pigs once more in a panic . The poor , medicated pig that had been fallen on Nas lying as still as when they 'd come . But the Rath brothers were fighting  --  it appeared , quite savagely  --  and the higher and farther from them that the helicopter moved , the more the world returned to a level of sanity of which Arden Bensenhaver approved . Until the tiny fighting figures , below and to the east , were no more than miniatures to him , and he was so far from their blood and fear that when the deputy said he thought that Raspberry could whip Weldon , if Raspberry just did n't allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " They 're animals , " he said to the deputy , who , despite whatever young man 's cruelty and cynicism were in him , seemed a little shocked . " If they both killed each other , " Bensenhaver said , " think of the food they would have eaten in their lifetimes that other human beings could now eat . " The deputy realized that Bensenhaver 's lie about the new lawabout the instant castration for sexual crimes  --  was more than a far/fetched story : for Bensenhaver , although he knew it was clearly not the law , it was what he thought the law should be . It was one of Arden Bensenhaver 's Toledo methods . " That poor woman , " Bensenhaver said ; he wrung the pieces of her bra in his thick-veined hands . " How old is this Oren ? " he asked the deputy . " Sixteen , maybe seventeen , " the deputy said . " just a kid . " The deputy was at least twenty-four himself . " If he 's old enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old enough to have it cut off . " But what should I cut ? Oh , where can I cut him ? wondered Hope  --  the long , thin fisherman 's knife now snug in her hand . Her pulse thrummed in her palm , but to Hope it felt as if the knife had a heartbeat of its own . She brought her hand very slowly up to her hip , up over the edge of the thrashed seat to where she could glimpse the blade . Should I use the saw-toothed edge or the one that looks so sharp ? she thought . How do you kill a man with one of these ? Alongside the sweating , swiveling ass of Oren Rath that knife in her hand was a cool and distant miracle . Do I slash him or stick him ? She wished she knew . Both his hot hands were under her buttocks , lifting her , jerking up . His chin dug into the hollow near her collarbone like a heavy stone . Then she felt him slip one of his hands out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , grazed her hand that held the knife . " Move ! " he grunted . " Now move . " She tried to arch her back but could n't ; she tried to twist her hips , but she could n't . She felt him gropingfor his own peculiar rhythm , trying to find the last pace that would make him come . His hand  --  under her now  --  spread over the small of her back ; his other hand clawed the floor . Then she knew : he was looking for the knife . And when his fingers found the empty sheath , she would be in trouble . " Aaahhh ! " he cried . Quick ! she thought . Between the ribs ? Into his side  --  and slide the knife up  --  or straight down as hard as she could between the shoulder blades , reaching all the way through his back to a lung , until she felt the point of the thing poking her own crushed breast ? She waved her arm in the air above his hunching back . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly rising , flung his empty pants back toward the steering wheel . He was trying to push himself up off her , but his lower half was locked into his long-sought rhythm ; his hips shuddered in little spasms he could n't seem to control , while his chest rose up , off her chest , andp307his hands shoved hard against her shoulders . His thumbs crawled toward her throat . " My knife ? " he asked . His head whipped back and forth ; he looked behind him , he looked above him . His thumbs pried her chin up ; she was trying to hide her Adam 's apple . Then she scissored his pale ass . He could not stop pumping down there , though his brain must have known there was suddenly another priority . " My knife ? " he said . And she reached over his shoulder and ( faster than she herself could see it happen ) she slid the slim-edged side of the blade across his throat . For a second , she saw no wound . She only knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her throat and went to find his own . He hid from her the gash she 'd expected to see . But at last she saw the dark blood springing between his tight fingers . He brought his hand away  --  he was searching for her hand , the one that held the knife  --  and from his slashed throat a great bubble burst over her . She heard a sound like someone sucking the bottom of a drink with a clogged straw . She could breathe again . Where were his hands ? she wondered . They seemed , at once , to loll beside her on the seat and to be darting like panicked birds behind his back . She stabbed the long blade into him , just above his waist , thinking that perhaps a kidney was there , because the blade went in so easily , and out again . Oren Rath laid his cheek against her cheek like a child . He 'd have screamed then , of course , but her first slash had cut cleanly through his windpipe and his vocal cords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rib , or somethingdifficult ; she had to probe and , unsatisfied , withdrew the knife after only a few inches . He was flopping on her now , as if he wanted to get off her . His body was sending distress signals to itself , but the signals were not getting all the way through . He heaved himself against the back of the seat , but his head would n't stay up and his penis , still moving , attached him still to Hope . She took advantage of this opportunity to insert the knife again . It slipped into his belly at the side andmoved straightaway to within an inch of his navel before engaging some major obstruction there  --  and his body slumped back on top of her , trappingher wrist . But this was easy ; she twisted her hand and the slippery knife came free . Something to do with his bowels relaxed . Hope was overwhelmed with his wetness and with his smell . She let the knife drop to the floor . Oren Rath was emptying , by quartfuls  --  by gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their bodies were so slick that she slipped out from under him easily . She shoved him over on his back and crouched beside him on the truck 's puddled floor . Hope 's hair was gravid with blood-his throat had fountained over her . When she blinked , her eyelashes stuck to her cheeks . One of his hands twitched and she slapped it.  | " Stop , " she said . His knee rose , then flopped down . " Stop it , stop now , " Hope said . She meant his heart , his life . She would not look at his face . Against the dark slime coating his body , the white , translucent condom hugged his shrunken cock like a congealed fluid quite foreign to the human matter of blood and bowel . Hope recalled a zoo , and a gob of camel spit upon her crimson sweater . His balls contracted . That made her angry . " Stop , " she hissed . The balls were small and rounded and tight ; then they fell slack . " Please stop , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny sigh , as if someone had let out a breath too small to bother taking back . But Hope squatted for some time beside him , feeling her heart pound and confusing her pulse with his own . He had died fairly quickly , she realized later . Out the open door of the pickup , Oren Rath 's clean white feet , his drained toes , pointed upward in the sunlight . Inside the sun-baked cab , the blood was coagulating . Everything clotted . Hope Standish felt the tiny hairs on her arms stiffen and tug her skin as her skin dried . Everythingthat was slick was turning sticky . I should get dressed , Hope thought . But something seemed wrong with the weather . Out the truck windows Hope saw the sunlight flicker , like a lamp whose light is shone through the blades of a fast fan . And the gravel at the roadside was lifted up in little swirls , and dry shards and stubble from last year 's corn were whisked along the flat , bare ground as if a great wind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind appeared to be blowing straight down . And the noise ! It was like being in the afterblow of a speeding truck , but there was still no traffic on the road . It 's a tornado ! Hope thought . She hated the Midwest with its strange weather ; she was an Easterner who could understand a hurricane . But tornadoes ! She 'd never seen one , but the weather forecasts were always full of " tornado watches . " What does one watch for ? she 'd always wondered . For this , she guessed  --  this whirling din all around her . These clods of earth flying . The sun turned brown . She was so angry , she struck the cool , viscid thigh of Oren Rath . After she had lived through this , now there was a fucking tornado , too ! The noise resembled a train passing over the pelted truck . Hope imagined the funnel descending , other trucks and cars already caught up in it . Somehow , she could hear , their engines were still running . Sand flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she groped for her dress  --  discovered the empty armholes where the sleeves had been ; it would have to do . But she would have to step outside the truck to put it on . There was no room to maneuver beside Rath and his gore , now dappled with road/side sand . And out there , she had no doubt , her dress would be torn from her hands and she would be sucked up naked into the sky . " I am not sorry , " she whispered . " I am not sorry ! " she screamed , and again she struck at the body of Rath . Then a voice , a terrible voice  --  loud as the loudest loudspeaker  --  shook her in the cab . " IF YOU 'RE IN THERE , COME OUT ! PUT YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD . COME OUT . CLIMB INTO THE BACK OF THE PICKUP AND LIE THE FUCK DOWN ! " I am actually dead , thought Hope . I 'm already in the sky and it 's the voice of God . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were a God , God would have a bullying , loudspeaker voice . " COME OUT NOW , " God said . " DO IT NOW . " Oh , why not ? she thought . You big fucker . What can you do to me next ? Rape was an outrage even God could n't understand . In the helicopter , shuddering above the black truck , Arden Bensenhaverbarked into the megaphone . He was sure that Mrs. Standish was dead . He could not tell the sex of the feet he saw protruding from the open door of the cab , but the feet had n't moved during the helicopter 's descent , and they seemed so naked and drained of any color in the sunlight that Bensenhaver was sure that they were dead feet . That Oren Rath could be the one who was dead had not crossed the deputy 's or Bensenhaver 's mind . But they could n't understand why Rath would have abandoned the truck , after performing his foul acts , and so Bensenhaver had told the pilot to hold the helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there with her , " Bensenhaver told the deputy , " maybe we can scare the bastard to death . " When Hope Standish brushed between those stiff feet and huddled alongside the cab , trying to shield her eyes from the flying sand , Arden Bensenhaver felt his finger go limp against the trigger of the megaphone . Hope tried to wrap her face in her flapping dress but it snapped around her like a torn sail ; she felt her way along the truck toward the tailgate , cringing against the stinging gravel that clung to the places on her body where the blood had n't quite dried . " It 's the woman , " the deputy said . " Back off ! " Bensenhaver told the pilot . " Jesus , what happened to her ? " the deputy asked , frightened . Bensenhaver roughly handed him the megaphone . " Move away , " he said to the pilot . " Set this thing down across the road . " Hope felt the wind shift , and the clamor in the tornado 's funnelp310seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Her wild dress quieted in her hands . She held it to her mouth because the dust was choking her . A car came along , but Hope was unaware of it . The driver passed in the proper lane  --  the black pickup off the road to his right , the helicoptersettling down off the road to his left . The bloody , praying woman , naked and caked with grit , took no notice of him driving past her . The driver had a vision of an angel on a trip back from hell . The driver 's reactionwas so delayed that he was a hundred yards beyond everything he 'd seen before he surprisingly attempted a U-turn in the road . Withoutslowing down . His front wheels caught the soft shoulder and slithered him across the road ditch and into the soft spring earth of a plowed bean field , where his car sank up to his bumpers and he could not open his door . He rolled down his window and peered across the mire to the road  --  like a man who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from the shore , and he was drifting out to sea . " Help ! " he cried . The vision of the woman had so terrified him that he feared there might be more like her around , or that whoever had made her look that way might be in search of another victim . " Jesus Christ , " said Arden Bensenhaver to the pilot , " you 'll have to go see if that fool is all right . Why do they let everyone drive a car ? " Bensenhaver and the deputy dropped out of the helicopter and into the same lush muck that had trapped the driver . " Goddamnit , " Bensenhaversaid . " Mother , " said the deputy . Across the road , Hope Standish looked up at them for the first time . Two swearing men were wallowing toward her out of a muddy field . The blades of the helicopter were slowing down . There was also a man peeping witlessly out the window of his car , but that seemed far away . Hope stepped into her dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn open and Hope had to pin a flap of material to her side with her elbow , or else leave her breast exposed . It was then that she noticed how sore her shoulders and her neck were . Arden Bensenhaver , out of breath and soaked with mud from his knees down , was in front of her suddenly . The mud made his trousers hug his legs so that , to Hope , he looked like an old man wearing knickers . " Mrs. Standish ? " he asked . She turned her back to him and hid her face , nodding . " So much blood , " he said , helplessly . " I 'm sorry we took so long . Are you hurt ? " She turned and stared at him . He saw the swelling around both eyes and her broken nose  --  and the blue bulge on her forehead . " It 's mostly his blood , " she said . " But I was raped . He did it , " she told Bensenhaver.  |p311Bensenhaver  had his handkerchief out ; he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might wipe the mouth of a child , but then he despaired at what a job it would be to clean her up and he put his handkerchief away . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 'm so sorry . We got here as fast as we could . We saw your baby and he 's fine , " Bensenhaver said . " I had to put him in my mouth , " Hope said to him . Bensenhaver shut his eyes . " And then he fucked me and fucked me , " she said . " He was going to kill me , later  --  he told me he would . I had to kill him . And I 'm not sorry . " " Of course you 're not , " Bensenhaver said . " And you should n't be , Mrs. Standish . I 'm sure you did the very best thing . " She nodded her head to him , then stared down at her feet . She put one hand out toward Bensenhaver 's shoulder and he let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bensenhaver and in order to rest her head against him , she had to scrunch down . Bensenhaver was aware of the deputy then ; he had been to the cab to look at Oren Rath and had vomited all over the truck 's front fender and in full view of the pilot who was walking the shocked driver of the stuck car across the road . The deputy , with his face the bloodless color of Oren Rath 's sunlit feet , was imploring Bensenhaver to come see . But Bensenhaver wanted Mrs. Standish to feel every possible reassurance . " " So you killed him after he raped you , when he was relaxed , not paying attention ? " he asked her . " No , during , " she whispered against his neck . The awful reek of her almost got to Bensenhaver , but he kept his face very close to her , where he could hear her . " You mean , while he was raping you , Mrs. Standish ? " " Yes , " she whispered . " He was still inside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants , on the floor , and he was going to use it on me when he was finished , so I had to , " she said . " Of course you did , " Bensenhaver said . " It does n't matter . " He meant that she should have killed him anyway  --  even if he had n't been planning to kill her . To Arden Bensenhaver there was no crime as serious as rape  --  not even murder , except perhaps the murder of a child . But he knew less about that ; he had no children of his own . He had been married seven months when his pregnant wife had been raped in a Laundromat while he waited outside for her in the car . Three kids had done it . They had opened one of the big spring-doored dryers and sat her ass on the open door , pushed her head into the warm dryer where she could only scream into the hot , muffling sheets and pillowcases and hear her own voice boom and bounce around the great motel drum . Her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was help/less . Her feet could n't even reach the floor . The spring door made her jounce up and down under all three of them , although she probably tried not to move . The boys had no idea , of course , that they were raping the police superintendent 's wife . And all the bright lighting possible for downtown Toledo on a Saturday night would not have saved her . They were an early-morning couple , the Bensenhavers . They were young still , and they took their laundry to the Laundromat together , Monday morning before breakfast ; they read the newspapers during the wash cycle . Then they put their laundry in the dryer and went home and had breakfast . Mrs. Bensenhaver picked it up on her way downtown to the police station with Bensenhaver . He would wait in the car while she went inside to get it ; sometimes , someone would have taken it out of the dryer while they were having breakfast and Mrs. Bensenhaver would have to run it for another few minutes . Bensenhaver then waited . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Laundromat . Only when Bensenhaver saw the three kids leaving did he start to worry about how long his wife had been collecting the dry laundry . But it does not take very long to rape someone , even three times . Bensenhaverwent into the Laundromat where he saw his wife 's legs sticking out of the dryer ; her shoes had fallen off . Those were not the first dead feet Bensenhaver had seen , but they were very important feet to him . She had suffocated in her own clean wash  --  or she had vomited , and choked  --  but they had not meant to kill her . That part had been an accident , and at the trial a great deal had been made of the unplanned nature of Mrs. Bensenhaver 's death . Their attorney had said that the boys had planned " to just rape her  --  not kill her , too . " And the phrase " just rape "  --  as in " She was just raped , lucky thing , a wonder she was n't killed ! "  --  appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Bensenhaver whispered to Hope Standish . " We could n't have done nearly enough to him , " he confided to her . " Nothing like he deserved . Good for you , " he whispered . " Good for you . " Hope had expected another sort of police experience , a more criticalinvestigation  --  at least , a more suspicious cop , and certainly a man very different from Arden Bensenhaver . She was so grateful , for one thing , that Bensenhaver was an old man , clearly in his sixties  --  like an uncle to her , or even more sexually remote : a grandfather . She said she felt better , that she was all right ; when she straightened up and stood away from him , she saw she had smeared his shirt collar and his cheek with blood , but Bensenhaver had n't noticed or did n't care . " Okay , show me , " Bensenhaver said to the deputy , but again he smiled gently at Hope . The deputy led him to the open cab.  | " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was saying . " Dear Jesus , look at this , and what 's that ? Christ , look , I think that 's his liver . Is n't that what a liver looks like ? " The pilot gawked in mute wonder and Bensenhaver caught both men by their coat shoulders and steered them roughly away . They started toward the rear of the truck , where Hope was composing herself , but Bensenhaver hissed at them , " Stay away from Mrs. Standish . Stay away from the truck . Go radio our position , " he told the pilot . " They 'll need an ambulance or something here . We 'll take Mrs. Standish with us . " " They 'll need a plastic bag for him , " said the deputy , pointing to Oren Rath . " He 's all over the place . " " I can see with my own eyes , " said Arden Bensenhaver . He looked inside the cab and whistled admiringly . The deputy started to ask , " Was he doing it when . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand into a horrible mess by the accelerator pedal , but he did n't seem to mind . He was reaching for the knife on the floor of the passenger 's side . He picked it up in his handkerchief ; he looked it over carefully , wrapped it in the handkerchief , and put it in his pocket . " Look , " the deputy whispered , conspiratorially . " Did you ever hear of a rapist wearing a rubber ? " " It 's not common , " Bensenhaver said . " But it 's not unknown . " " It 's weird to me , " said the deputy . He looked amazed as Bensenhaverpinched the prophylactic tight , just below its bulge ; Bensenhaver snapped the rubber off and held it , without spilling a drop , up to the light . The sack was as large as a tennis ball . It had n't leaked . It was full of blood . Bensenhaver looked satisfied ; he tied a knot in the condom , the way you 'd knot a balloon , and he flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . " I do n't want someone suggesting that it might not have been a rape , " Bensenhaver said softly to the deputy . " Got it ? " He did n't wait for the deputy to answer ; Bensenhaver went to the back of the truck to be with Mrs. Standish . " How old was he  --  that boy ? " Hope asked Bensenhaver . " Old enough , " Bensenhaver told her . " About twenty-five or twentysix , " he added . He did not want anything to diminish her survival  --  particularly , in her own eyes . He waved to the pilot , who was to help Mrs. Standish aboard . Then he went to clear things with the deputy . - You stay here with the body and the bad driver , " he told him . " I 'm not a bad driver , " the driver whined . " Christ , if you 'd seen that lady there  --  in the road . . . " And keep anyone away from the truck , " Bensenhaver said.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
