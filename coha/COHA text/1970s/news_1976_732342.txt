txt On a clammy , cold Tuesday night in this hibernating beach town on the New Jersey shore the hottest spot is the Headliner  --  a floodlit pillbox squatting in a black- ? opped parking lot where a group called the Hi TAeg &; a Lass is opening a one-week stand . Five big bars circle the dance floor in the dimly lit club . Tonight , two are open . A few couples are sitting on the bar stools ; there is one cluster of single women , and several solitary men in the shadows , dragging on cigarets and nursing beers . On a platform behind the longest bar , the five male members of the HI Laaa &; a Lass are " warming up " the crowd with their big instrumental rendition of " Watermelon Man . " They hit the finale with a thundering of trumpet , saxophone , organ , electric guitar and drums . The music stops , revealing a steady buzz of conversation . Two women who were dancing together stop dancing . Three people clap . The Hi Lads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their word . They consider themselves performers as well as musicians , but here their performance is being received as just background music . " It 's a bring-down , " says organist Jay Curtis at the break . " I 'd rather be in a nightclub ; I 'd rather be on a vaudeville stage . " But with vaudeville extinct and bigcity nightclubs also seemingly close to extinction , the Iii Lads owe their existence to the isolated clubs in New Jersey ( so they can make brief trips to see their families in the northern part of the state ) and to the relatively recent phenomenon of the big motel . Production Numbers There are probably hundreds of groups like them  --  Energy , the Spiral Staircase , the Patti Cassara Show , the Upson Downs . They are n't just bands but musical variety acts , miniature traveling stock companies that stage choreographed dancing , fancy costuming and comedy routines along with their music . They are also among the least cele. brated of America 's itinerant musicians . The Hi Lads &; a Lass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the better groups . The group has been kicking around in various incarnations for 20 years , ever since Frank taitiore ( who tells everybody his age is 33 though it is really 38 ; and five high school buddies started playing dances in Newark . Ralph Michaels ( his real surname is Columbino ) hooked up with the group in 1968 . He is a Vietnam veteran with three purple hearts , a loser on the Ted Mack Amateur Hour and the owner of a rasping blues singer 's voice and a new hair transplant . Ralph says he is 31 going on 90 . Jay Curtis , 32 , has been singing Pagliacci in a clear tenor and playing organ for the Hi Lads for seven years . His real name is Kozodoy , and he has been a traveling musician since he got out of Erasmus High School in Brooklyn when he was 19 . Sebastian Russo , 28 , plays the trumpet and fluegelharn , and Billy Meligari , 23 , plays the drums . They both became Hi Lads in the past year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the group for almost three years and has only just turned 21 . With time out for a run-in with a truant officer , she has been a traveling singer since she was 14 . She has a powerful voice that falls somewhere between Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli . Onstage , she appears to be a sultry 30-year-old mulatto , which she is n't . Offstage , she is a friendly , plumpish youngster whose real last name is Applebaum . Upper Middle Class At the top of their class and getting pail as much as $3,600 a week , the Hi Lads play " very , very exclusive clubs " on the road , in the words of their manager , Bill Ramal . These include major Holiday Inns in Memphis , Term. ; Bridgeport , Conn. , and Syracuse , N.Y. , the Clearwater , Fla. , Hilton and three important Pennsylvania dates : the Hershey Motor Lodge , the King of Prussia Sheraton and the Wilkes-Barre Treadway . The group has numerous Ohio credits ( Cleveland , Youngstown , Cincinnati , Dayton , Niles ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The act 's status booking is Shepheard 's in New York City , about the only room there where unknown show groups are likely to get work . When they played Shepheard 's last March , the Hi Lads also landed a radio interview . " They lit up this town , " said the announcer . ( The program was aired at 3:09 qn a Sunday morning . ) Of course , the Hi Lads have occasionally found themselves booked at clubs they indelicately refer to as " toilets , " places where the music can barely be heard above the brawling and the dressing rooms are narrow air spaces between the stage and the back Wan " We booked a room that was so bad ? " Jay says . " How bad was it ? " asks Ralph . The ancient punch line : " That room was so bad the bouncers were throwing people The Headliner does n't exactly fit that deacription , but on a show group 's ladder to stardom it is a few rungs below the Harbour House in Lynn , Mass. , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their instruments into their battered trailer and driving their Chevy station ws , gon down to Neptune . Then again , the Harbour House is n't the Cops . It Is a boxy affair across fnam some used car lets on the mud flats of the Saugus River , between the Gen. Edwards Bridge and the Mexicana Imported Wholesale Outlet . It has 70 motel rooms and a big night club with glitter-flecked ceilings and a hanging , mosaic-mirrored globe that reflects dots of red and blue light onto the walls as it revolves . On a Sunday evening , Frank Lepore was in his room watching television and pulling on his closing-night costume : gray , doubleknit leisune auit , flowered shirt ( half unbuttoned ) , choicer necklace and red , stackedheeled patent-leather pumps . Frank laughed at Bob Hope on television and observed , " If you make it , you can go on forever . If you do n't , you pass a point where you ca n't work any more . I do n't expect to be a gypsie until I 'm 60 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pull in $4,000 a. night , just like that " The Hi Lads have never had that hit , though they have made recordings . Somehow , the break has n't come . As far back as the early 1960s , the Hi Lads were on the Ed Sullivan Show . They were on twice  --  Memorial Day and New Year 's Eve . Evidently , nobody was watching . A couple of years ago , they changed their name to " Sweet Ivory , " put on some scruffy clothes and made a rock album . It was never released . Recently , they made a single called " That 's the Way I Like It . " A song with that lyric is on the charts right now , but it 's a different song by a different group . They also recorded a song meant to latch onto the popularity of the movie " Jaws . " The craze passed ; the record is gathering dust . Now , in Massachusetts , Frank Lepore is on the floor of the club , mixing with a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a birthday party for Dorms . Grant from the local Sears Roebuck credit office , and there ds an animated rearranging of tables so the party can sit together . The Hi Lads do n't benefit from instant recognition . " I think they 're an Irish group , " Miss Grant ventures . " The problem , " says Frank Lepore as he prepares to step up to the stage , " is we do n't have anything that 's us  --  we 're a little bit of everybody . It 's great in the clubs , but no good for making it " Variety and Spice The lights go out , and six white spotlights flash through the smoky haze . The singers fling themselves into an ebullient tune that goes , " Join us ! Sing our song , as we go along our waaaay . . . , " while Jay Curtis booms out : " And NOW , ladies and gentlemen , the Harbour House PROUDLY presents ... the HI LADS &; A LASS ! " For 55 minutes , Frank paces the group through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby , " " Teenager in Love " . . . ) ; Jay 's " Vest La Giubba " from Pagliacci ; a scene from West Side Story ( " Officer Krupke " ) , and a medley of gospel songs ( " Oh Happy Day , " " Amen ! " . . ) . All of this is interspersed with current hits , some dancing and a bit of mildly risque comedy , topped off by Jay singing " Mama . " " Good night , God bless and drive carefully , " Frank says as the house lights brighten and the crowd begins to leave . On her way out , a middle-aged woman kisses Jay . " I never heard that song sung like that since my great aunt died , " ehe tells him . Another woman gives the group a farewell present : three packs of cards . At 2 a.m. in the empty club , the Hi Lads start the long laborious job of taking apart their speakers and amplifiers , winding yards of wire , cramming props into bags , intruments into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 7:30 a.m. they are gathered In Frank 's room to be paid . On his knees , using the bed as a desk , Frank is counting out their salaries from a tall stack of small bills ? $3,250 , a week 's pay from the Harbour House cash box . The HI Lads gross about $100,000 in a year . Subtract $15,000 in agent 's and manager 's fees , subtract expenses for food , transportation , equipment , clothes , split it six ways and you have an idea how much a member of a highclass show group can make by working six nights a week , five hours a night . Mixed Emotions " It 's a decent living , " says Frank , but Julie does n't know : " If we could just get known  --  I 'm not even talking stars  --  then we could get some good , good money , and take a month off , and buy some nice clothes and not have to do five dance sets a night in New Jersey .

A day later , Julie George is sitting on a suitcase in the Headliner 's " dressing room , " tearfully rubbing an inflamed callous on her foot . " I do n't even want to play this room , a room like this , " she pouts . " I ca n't walk . I ca n't even smile ; it hurts so much . " " Everybody 's got to do a little scuffling , " Ralph Michaels tells her . After the Hi Lads finish their " warm up , " Julie forces her foot into her highheeled sandal , transforms herself into a smooth sophisticate , and walks to the microphone behind the bar . She sings . She dances .
