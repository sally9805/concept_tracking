New York City 's Parks Department had a problem : tree thieves . One night somebody pinched 80 rhododendrons along upper Fifth Avenue ; last year thieves dug up and hauled away more than $55,000 worth of newly planted shrubs and trees . Now the Parks people rig each new planting with a chain shackled to a stake . The stake is dropped into the hole and turned horizontally . Then the plant roots are arranged around the stake , the hole is filled and the entire gadget concealed with earth . The Parks Department claims it has foiled at least one would-be thief . Workmen in Central Park recently found a plant with all the dirt dug out around its roots , but still firmly anchored to its stake .
