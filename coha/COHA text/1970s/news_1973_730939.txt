txt When French President Georges Pompidou drives into Peking on ' rues-day afternoon his route along the Boulevard of Eternal Peace will be strung with red-silk banners proclaiming a " Chaleureuse bienvenue ! " ( warm welcome ) , and the six days that follow will produce as rich a celebration of friendship as the Chinese leaders have laid on for any visitor from outside the Communist camp . But he may well find that the warmth of the public reception dissipates somewhat when he sits down at the green baize table in the Great Hall of the People to discuss European detente with Premier Chou En-lai . What irks the Chinese is that the French , together with their partners in the Western alliance , are pursuing negotiations that will allow them to lower the guard they have mounted against the Soviet Union in Europe  --  a policy that Peking believes to be bad in itself , for Europe , and potentially catastrophic for China , which wishes to avoid any development 's that would free Moscow to increase its troop strength along the tense Chinese-Soviet border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , both publicly and in private sessions with visiting Western dignitaries , the Chinese have been pressing the view that the Soviets have set a trap with their bid for mutual force reductions and for a new security system that will replace the existing military blocs . // *Pompidou 's China visit // Such proposals , say the Chinese , are a cynical device for weakening and dividing the NATO alliance , creating a situation in which Moscow can establish dominion over Europe either directly , by invasion , or indirectly , by military threat . The link between European and Chinese security is one that the Chinese themselves never make explicit , but it is self-evident . Indeed , many diplomats believe that it was just this link which first persuaded the Chinese to sue for improved relations with the West , in the belief that the best means of deterring a Soviet strike against themselves was to gain some influence with the nations that concront Moscow on its European front . Objectives assessed The minimum objective of such a strategem would be to create doubt in the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would sit idly by in the event of a Soviet attack on China . And the maximum objective would be to persuade the NATO countries to retard or stop althgether the move toward detente with Moscow , ensuring that the Soviets were never left free to concentrate on their eastern front . The Chinese are proud people and react angrily to any suggestion that they have any such stratagem in mind . One very senior official is reported to have unleashed a tirade against a European visitor who put such a suggestion to him recently , insisting that China is well able to defend itself and that Europe would do well to prepare itself likewise . The story suggests the intensity of Chinese passions that Mr. Pompidou may encounter when the topic comes up for discussion . Another indication came in Mr. Chou 's speech to the recent party congress , in which he accused the West for the first time of promoting detente in Europe in order to turn Soviet attentions eastwards to China . " The West always wants to urge the Soviet revisionists eastward to divert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as all is quiet in the West , " he said . " China is an attractive piece of meat coveted by all . But this meat is very tough , and for years no one has been able to bite into it . " These were harsh words indeed for a man who has placed such stock in improved relations with the West . Unless they were a bone tossed to the xenophobes who refuse to believe that Western attitudes toward China have undergone any change since the Opium War , a most unlikely gesture for a man of Mr. Chou 's stature , they must be regarded as an indication that the Chinese leaders have begun to despair of the hopes they once pinned on their approach to the West . If this is so , and Chinese leaders have come to believe that the West is willing to sacrifice China for the sake of its own security , then the very foundation of the new relationships is threatened . If so , it will be the job of . Mr. Pompidou and other Western leaders visiting Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new entente is worth saving .
