Greek Shipowner Stavros Niarchos and his wife Eugenie were having late dinner in their home on the heavily wooded islet of Spetsopoula , which sits in the Aegean , 56 helicopter miles from Athens . During dinner , Niarchos placed a telephone call to Charlotte Ford in Paris . He was wed briefly to Charlotte in 1965 before returning to Eugenie , his wife of 22 years who had borne him four children . Niarchos wanted Charlotte to send their four-year-old daughter , Elena , to Spetsopoula for a visit , as she had done the year before . After some discussion , Charlotte agreed , and there is some speculation that she may have offered to bring the child herself . <P> Within an hour , a maid found Eugenie , deep in a coma , sprawled on her bedroom floor . An empty Seconal bottle lay near by . It was 11 p.m. on May 3 . Niarchos called his sister in Athens and asked her to send a doctor employed by the Niarchos shipyards . When the doctor arrived from Athens by helicopter , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 44 , died . The doctor refused to sign a death certificate because death was not from natural causes . The police , who noted bruises on Eugenie 's throat and abdomen , ordered an inquiry . <P> Ugly Rumors . Niarchos was told not to leave the country , and Eugenie 's body was taken to Athens for an autopsy . Officials said nothing , and the Greek press was forbidden to discuss the investigation . But the Niarchos family leaked the medical examiner 's report that Eugenie , who had taken 25 Seconal tablets , had died from an overdose of barbiturates . The report also supported Niarchos ' contention that the bruises on her body were caused by his efforts to revive her . <P> While ugly rumors still circulated in Athens tavernas , Niarchos went about his business . Earlier this summer he asked a special board of magistrates for permission to go abroad on business . After posting bond , he flew off for five days to London . As if nothing had happened , the Greek junta went ahead and ratified a $200 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a new state oil refinery in return for oil-import concessions . A member of the medical team involved in the case confided that he was " almost sure there will be a happy ending . " <P> Bodily Injuries . Last week , however , that ending seemed somewhat in question . After a lengthy investigation , Piraeus Public Prosecutor Constantine Fafoutis formally recommended that Niarchos be charged with causing bodily injuries leading to his wife 's death . The prosecutor suggested that Niarchos be tried under Article 311 of the Greek penal code , which corresponds to the Anglo-Saxon concept of involuntary homicide . Under Greek legal procedure , the prosecutor 's recommendation now goes to a " penal council " composed of three magistrates , who must decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant bringing Niarchos to trial . If convicted under Article 311 , Niarchos would face a maximum penalty of 18 years in prison . <P> When the prosecutor 's recommendation was announced last week , Niarchos was aboard his black-hulled schooner Creole off the Cte d'Azur . Once again , Niarchos protested that Eugenie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , alas , only a single sad truth , " he told reporters . " All witnesses agree . " Niarchos can only hope that the magistrates agree too .
