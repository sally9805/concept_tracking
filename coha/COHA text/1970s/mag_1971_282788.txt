Several days after the great moment , Leonard Bernstein was sick in bed in his Washington hotel suite . He looked gaunt , and was exhausted from more than a year 's work on the Mass in places as far-flung as Montauk , Tel Aviv and Vienna , and by a final bout of rehearsing that over the past few months has permitted him only three hours ' sleep a night . Disappointed but not discouraged by the critical reception of his Mass , Bernstein was overwhelmed by the passionate response he felt it had stirred among the audience in general . On this and other topics he spoke to TIME Reporter-Researcher Rosemarie Tauris Zadikov , displaying an extraordinary enthusiasm for his own work . <P> ON THE THEME AND ITS EFFECT : The celebrant represents what in every person allows him to live , to go from day to day , which is the capacity to believe . That is what is destroyed along with the order of the Mass and the vessels of Communion . Then there is the long silence . Everyone in that silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spark of God . Not in any icon or symbol or trappings of religion but inside . Only when he finds that can he begin to relate to another person , then to a group , ultimately to society . And this is the miracle I saw take place : the waves of tenderness , these waves of touching and embracing , began to spread from the stage to the house , until they passed through the whole audience and then even out into the street . I saw people embracing strangers on the street-cops , just ordinary people . <P> ON HOW HE CONCEIVES THE WORK : It is as though you are attending a Mass , or participating in it or just listening to it , and as it goes along simultaneously there are thoughts , reactions , objections , questions , doubts , emotions engendered by the liturgy itself . The Mass is constantly interrupted by these thoughts : " Wait a minute ! Just hold it for a second ! I have a question about that , or I do not believe that . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how violent they are , no matter how angry they are , they are prayers born of an immense desire to believe , which is in conflict with the in ability to go along blindly with it . It is a prayer . It is wanting to believe . <P> ON WHETHER THE MASS IS RELIGIOUSLY OFFENSIVE : A lot of the Mass is about failure , about the fact that we have come to this extraordinary point of evolution and yet we are still killing one another officially , which is an enormous failure of the human race . And it is one of the main things we have to confess in the Mass . I have been interested in Catholicism since I was very young , and I learned a lot from my wife , who was brought up a Catholic . I was naturally very eager not to offend the Catholics or the Kennedys , and yet there was pretty violent stuff . You see , I have not written a Mass . I have written a theater piece about a Mass . It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a deeply religious work . The Communion we give is the kiss of peace , which was a feature of the early Christian Mass . Catholics who heard it have told me it was one of the deepest experiences they ever had .
