txt A year after he joined the Democratic party , Mayor Lindsay is making overtures to regular Democratic leaders in what some top party members believe could be a prelude to an alliance between the Mayor and the organization leaders in the mayoral campaign next year or the gubernatorial campaign in 1974 . At the same time , the 59-year-old Mayor appears to be antagonizing many of the liberal anti-organization Democrats who provided the core of his Democratic strength in the 1969 mayoral campaign . This was the virtually unanimous view of leading Democrats , including politicians close to the Mayor , in a series of interviews on Mr. Lindsay 's first anniversary as a Democrat . The Mayor left an increasingly hostile Republican party a year ago today and joined the seemingly more congenial Democratic party , John J. 13 . Shea , chairman of the reform caucus within the Democratic State Committee , was one of the many Democrats who detected a Lindsay shift toward the Democratic party leadership in the city and state eight months after he had begun a Presidential campaign without their support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I assume he is toying with going again for Mayor and with as much of the organization as he can get , " Mr. Shea said . " He is absolutely dead with reform Democrats and the people who elected him in 1969 , but he could wind up as the candidate of the bosses , " Mr. Shea added . Other Democrats , while convinced of the increasingly close rapport between the Mayor and the Democratic state chairman , Joseph F. Crangle , and the city 's five county leaders , were not convinced that the detente was aimed at next year 's election . " If he could get a commitment on Governor from the five county leaders , lie would n't run for Mayor , " said one of those county leaders , City Councilman Matthew J. Troy Jr . of Queens . Could the Mayor get such a commitment ? " You ca n't give a guy a guarantee for two years from now , " said Assem- , blyman Frank G. Rossetti , the Manhattan Democratic leader , " but you could . say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll give you the same support when you run for Governor . " Both Mc , . Troy and Mr. Rossetti subscribe to the current conventional wisdom that the Mayor is running for something . If so , the Mayor would need some kind of a political power base , particularly in a primary campaign , The county leaders , although shadows of their powerful predecessors , could provide that . Mayor Said to Be Tired However , there are some politicians , including two who are fairly close to Mr. Lindsay , who feel that he is tired and wants to quit politics for a time but wants to wind up his City Hall career in relative peace and harmony with the party leaders as well as the public . " I 've a feeling that he 's not going to run again , and it 's a strong feeling based on things he said to me and his wife said to me " declared a leading Manhattan Democrat who asked not to be identified . " He does n't want any more I flack with the county leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , " said the Lindsay friend , referring to attacks ' on the Mayor by Meade H. Esposito , the Brooklyn Democratic leader , Mr. Troy and some of their followers on the Board of Estimate and in the City Council . " He 's worn down ? he 's tired of all the fighting , " said another Democrat friendly to the Mayor . Whatever the reason , there is abundant evidence of the rapprochement between the Mayor and the " political bosses " he so often attacked both as a Republican and Democrat . At the Democratic National Convention last month , Mr. Lindsay clearly aligned himself with the tiny minority of regular Democrats in a New York delegation that was overwhelmingly anti-organization pro-qzmcq#Govern . Mending Fences The Mayor backed to the bitter end Mr. Crangle 's futile bid for the delegation chairmanship , supported Chicago Mayor Richard 3 . Daley 's vain fight to avoid ( ) lister and refused to endorse Senator George until literally 10 minutes before the New York delegation ballot was cast . He met on Monday with Mr. Troy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He an:agonized Borough President Robert Abrams and other Bronx ! anti-organization Democrats by ais extravagant praise of ; Patra ? .1 . Cunningham , the Bronx Democratic leader , as " my kind of politician " and " a fighter in the ranks of political change . " The Mayor appointed two Civil Court judges recently on Mr. Rossetti 's recommendation . Mr. Lindsay 's relations wil Mr. Esposito , the leader of the largest Democratic organization in the city , are still personally strained , since Mr. Esposito called on the Mayor to " come back Little Sheba " in the midst of the Wisconsin primary . However , Mr. Esposito and Richard R. Aurelio , the Mayor 's political adviser , have resumed contact and there has been at , least a trickle of , patronage to Brooklyn Democrats . As the Mayor moves closer . to the regulars , he further an- ' tagonizes New Democratic Coalition Democrats , who generally supported him in 1969 , while the regular party leaders ' , were backing Mario A. Procaccino for Mayor . i " The mayor is completely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel G. Collins , - the coalition chairman . ' He added that as of now Mr.1 Lindsay not a " viable candi-I date " for either city or state office . Jewish Hostility Cited A coalition Democrat who is close to Mr. - Lindsay said that many of these liberal Democrats were Jewish and did not , want to be identified with the Mayor because of hostility to /dm in the Jewish community over the Forest Hills housing project and school decentralirat ion . The strained relations with ' the liberal wing of the party is also evident in the chill between the mayor and Senator ' . The Mayor was not invited to join other Democratic presi'dential losers on the platform at the national convention in what a Lindsay aide said was an " unconscionable " slight . Mr. also apparently rejected Mr. Troy 's public suggestion that the Mayor be Senator 's chief urban ! affairs adviser . n addition , the Mayor has - not been consulted in the setting up of a here . The Mayor seemed to he ' getting in nis licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast meeting of Senator with Democratic mayors in Washington . " Irreversible schedule commitnent , " the Mayor said . The irreversible commitment later turned out to be a news conprence.
