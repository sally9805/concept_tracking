Open wide , please , should not include the wallet <P> As anyone knows who ever sat back waiting for the worst , a dentist 's chair is not the place where a patient feels at his most masterful . " Whatever you say , Doc , " is a customary attitude . But it also can be an invitation to painful larceny , both petit and grand , or so says a dentist named Melvin Denholtz . <P> Along with his wife Elaine , Denholtz , 50 , who is chief of dental research at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center , is the author of a new consumer 's guide titled How to Save Your Teeth and Your Money ( Van Nostrand Reinhold ; $8.95 ) . He chides Americans for spending nearly $9 billion a year on dental care " without the foggiest notion " of what their dentists are doing for them , and estimates that some 6 million people lose perfectly salvageable teeth each year , many at " extraction mills . " Writes Denholtz , quoting a Pennsylvania insurance department estimate : 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As an antidote to such outrages , the book urges consumers to drill their dentists on basic subjects like costs , procedures and alternatives before submitting to anything more drastic than a tooth cleaning or an X ray . <P> To avoid exorbitant fees , Denholtz suggests , try a little new-fashioned comparison shopping . According to the American Dental Association 's 1975 fee survey , national U.S. averages are $10 for a silver filling on one tooth surface , $13 for a simple extraction , $14 for cleaning , $92 for root-canal therapy and $251 for full upper dentures . For the financially strapped patient , Denholtz recommends Government clinics and dental schools - often inconvenient , sometimes low on quality , but easy on the wallet . At all costs , do not fall prey to what Denholtz calls cut-rate " assembly line " dental sweatshops , where one man said he had all his teeth pulled in 35 seconds while the dentist boasted , " This is just like shelling corn . " <P> Other tips : beware the dentist who keeps people waiting for hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visit , works without assistants , does not take X rays , wants to extract without suggesting alternatives for saving a tooth , does not use disposable needles to administer local anesthetics , charges unusually high or low fees , never explains his fees or procedures . If a dentist commits several of these violations , Denholtz recommends that patients should consider going elsewhere . <P> What can be done afterward about a dentist who has overcharged or provided incompetent treatment ? Denholtz advises taking the complaint up with the dentist first . If you do not get satisfaction , go to your dental society , insurance carrier or consumer-advocate agency . " If nothing else works , " Denholtz concludes , " then consult your attorney . " But he admits that the odds are stacked against the consumer : only a handful of dentists lose their licenses each year , and malpractice suits are rarely worth the cost or trouble . <P> It is doubtful Denholtz will do for dental consumers what Ralph Nader did for auto buyers a decade ago .
