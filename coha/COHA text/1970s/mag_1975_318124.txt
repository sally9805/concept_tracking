The 32nd Annual Pictures-of-the-Year competition earned for TIME 'S graphics staff another in a lengthening list of awards-first prize for Best Magazine Use of Pictures . The competition , jointly sponsored by the University of Missouri School of Journalism and the National Press Photographers ' Association assessed three issues of TIME published last year : our Man of the Year issue on King Faisal , with ten pages of color from the Middle East ; " Inside the Brain " ( Jan. 14 , 1974 ) , which included a color X-ray scan of a tumored brain ; and the Aug. 19 issue , which photographically chronicled Gerald Ford 's succession to the presidency . Judgments were based on layout and editing as well as quality of photography . <P> Two of our most trophied photographers also won fresh kudos : <P> &gt; Eddie Adams , whose Pulitzer Prize photo of a 1968 street execution in Saigon is perhaps the most haunting image of the Indochina War , was named Magazine Photographer of the Year in the Pictures-of-the-Year competition . Adams also won prizes for several individual pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , May 20 ) and a photo of straining oarsmen in a boat race in Abu Dhabi ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) . <P> &gt; Ken Regan took first prize in news feature pictures from the World Press Photo competition in Amsterdam for his evocative glimpse of Ted Kennedy walking in Moscow with his arm around his son Teddy Jr . ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) . Kennedy reciprocated by snapping a shot of Regan with a grinning Leonid Brezhnev . <P> Credit for TIME 'S lively use of graphics is shared by Art Director David Merrill and Picture Editor John Durniak . Newshound Durniak brings his tireless enthusiasm 15 hours a day to half a dozen tasks at once : arguing for more " cuts " in the magazine , urging extensive coverage of pictorially rich news events , phoning photographers halfway round the world to tell them that their exposure meters need adjustment . " Journalism starts with visual observation , " Durniak says . " The eye is the mother of the brain . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
