txt This city 's 10,000 college students face the prospect of paying a $20 annual " tuition tax " this year under a proposed ordinance nearing a vote in the City Council . Such a head tax , believed to be the first of its kind in the nation , would raise around 5300,000 a year , for the city government . Evanston 's educational community ? , Northwestern University , Kendall College and Seabury . Western and Garrett Theological Seminaries  - -  charges that the proposed tax would be discriminatory and unconstitutional and would represent a threat to higher education 's historical tax-exempt status . In Washington and at a number of colleges around the country educators preparing for the fall session expressed shock at the tax proposal , which came under public debate here this week . Present Deficit Cited " My reaction Is one of horror , " John F. Meek , vice president of Dartmouth College , in Hanover , N. H. , said . " This kind of tax could catch on like wildfire . And colleges are already having a hard time with deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to face many of the nation 's university communities soon . It pits the financially hardpressed municipalities and their beleagured property taxpayers against the administrators , faculty members and students of the financially hard-pressed ? but tax exempt  --  schools . Many universities around the country have for years tacitly agreed that their presence puts additional demands on civic services , such as the police and fire departments , and that they should pay something for these services . Since 1928 , for Instance , Harvard University has paid Cambridge , Mass , , an annual sum in lieu of property taxes ' on its academic facilities . This year Harvard 's payments totaled $110,000 . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology , also in Cambridge , makes similar payments , while Dartmouth College pays more than $300,000 a year , about a quarter of Hanover 's tax collection , on the college 's nonacademic facilities , Stanford University pays property taxes on its nonacademic holdings . In Evanston , a quiet city of 80,000 Just north of Chicago , the issue has soured once cordial city-university relations and planted seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one school administrator said , " that this tax proposal came up between summer school and fall quarter when no one is on campus . " " There was no plot , " John O Wyandt , the alderman who introduced the bill , said . The 18 ? member council voted to postpone a final decision until the college students , who will be voting in next spring 's aldermanic elections , return to campus next month . City officials declined to predict the prospects for passage of the measure , pending public hearings before the council . The tuition tax proposal was the first of 16 new revenue sources to emerge as legislation Isom a three-man committee headed by Mr. Wyandt . Other possibilities included city taxes on cigarettes , gasoline , hotel rooms and liquor sales . In its present form , the proposed tuition tax would require each coil* student in Evanston to pay the city $15 a semester or $10 an academic , quarter . Part time students would pay half those amounts . The city 's four colleges would , collect the tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee . " We are searching for new revenues , " Mr. Wyandt said , " that fall less on the property taxpayer , many of whom have very little income . " Like other Evanston landowners , Mr. Wyandt has seen ? his property taxes nearly triple in 12 years to $8.36 ' per $100 of assessed valuation . Next year 's payments will top $9 . A Quarter of City 's Land The city 's colleges are exempt from taxes as nonprofit institutions . Together they own about a quarter of Evanston ' 8.5 square miles , effectively eliminating that land from the city 's tax rolls while the costs , of the municipal government , now at $16-million a year , continue to increase . Northwestern 's state charter frees it even from paying taxes on land that it leases to commercial tenants . But in recent years , university off idals said , they have made efforts to help the city . When new land was needed for campus expansion , for instance , the university filled in 70 acres on Lake Michigan instead of buying existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning it to the tax rolls , and last year it purchased a new $35,000 fire engine for the city . After the anti-war campus demonstrations of 1969 , the university made a payment for exarordinary city police expenses . The tuition tax proposal came as something of a surprise . According to Raymond Mack , a Northwestern vice president and dean of faculties , the uni , versity this year has insufficient funds amounting to $35 for each student . He said that the proposed tax would cause serious hardship for many of the growing number of middle ' Class and poor youths attending College . " No tax is desirable , " Edward A. Martin , Evanston 's city manager , said " The question is , is the tuition tax less undesirable than increasing property taxes ? " " Maybe property tax relief is needed , " said Doug Kmiec , ' a senior political science major who is organizing the Northwestern Anti-Tax Coalition , " but should students be the ones to provide it ? We already pay $3,000 a year tuition , and 46 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax is a dangerous precedent . It could be hundreds of dollars soon . " " Sure the klas are , upset , " Mr. Wyandt said , " but what 's the difference between $3,000 and $3,030 ? It 's just the price of a physics book . " Others believe that minor cost increases , especially at private institutions like Evanston 's , will encourage more parents to send their children to public colleges , which is cheaper for a family but more costly for society , which finances them . Mr. Kmiet feels that the city is ignoring the economic and cultural benefits brought to Evanston by Northwestern , which is the city 's largest employer . Also , opponents say that the plan is unconstitutional because it discriminates against the occupation of students . " Being a student may be a way of life , " Mr. Wyandt commented . " but it 's not an occupation . " If the City Council approves the proposed ordinance , court battles are assured . In the only other similar court case cited by educators , the Pennsylvania Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1 per cent tax on the gross receipts of all non-profit institutions , including hospitals , charities and colleges . In Washington officials of many education associations said that they would file suits opposing the tuition tax in any court case involving it . " We would strongly oppose any taxes , however labeled , on private , nonprofit educational institutions , " John Morse of the American Council on Education , said . " Once you start eroding the tax exempt status , there 's no way to stop It . " In New York City , where there are 31 universities and larger ? colleges , Mayor Lindsay began in 1968 a legal campaign against the tax exemptions allowed for property owned by nonprofit educational institutions , churches and charities , but the campaign has not been successful . Robin Schmidt , an assistant vice president at Harvard , said : " We will see a growing number of attempts by governments to chip away at the taxexempt status as the cities ' financial predicaments become more acute . But the final answer is not to go after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer is to look toward the states and Washington . That is where help must come from . "
