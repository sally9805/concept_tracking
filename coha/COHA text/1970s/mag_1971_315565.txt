The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker is derived from a book by Charles Webb , who wrote the novel The Graduate . It is directed by Lawrence Turman , who produced the film of The Graduate . Its hero , William Alren , might well be Graduate Ben Braddock after a couple of years of wedded atrophy . But Marriage is neither as facile nor as funny as The Graduate , and Richard Benjamin , who plays the stockbroker , comes off like a dry-cleaned Dustin Hoffman . <P> Alren 's job is an enervating drag and his marriage a ritual of programmed indifference . For kicks he takes up voyeurism . One night his wife Lisa ( Joanna Shimkus ) discovers him spying on a teen-age swim party and promptly takes off for her sister 's . Alren makes several attempts to lure her back , each stymied by Lisa 's obstinacy or the pseudopsychological prattering of her sister Nan ( Elizabeth Ashley ) , who has , it seems , a good deal more than an amateur analyst 's interest in her brother-in-law . She makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point she practically unravels her bathing suit in an attempt to interest him . He remains impassive throughout . <P> What finally shakes Alren up is a stumblebum encounter with a sullen nymphomaniac ( Tiffany Boiling ) . He takes a plane to Mexico , gets a quickie divorce , and , without explanation or motivation , promptly returns for his exwife , whom he seduces in the linen closet of the country club . " There are no answers , " he announces with the pride of someone who has solved the riddie of the Sphinx . " You 've just got to start by starting . " So saying , he takes Lisa , clad only in a towel , and charges across the well-populated lawn of the country club like Ben Braddock dashing out of the church . As Alren and Lisa jump into their car and head for a happy ending , a white towel comes sailing out the window and floats slowly to earth . <P> The message , if it can be called that , seems to be that the remedy for marital discord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising a ruckus at the country club , and that happiness is a discarded towel . As Turman and Scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr . ( Pretty Poison ) go for the simple solution , they favor the easy laugh . " Relax , enjoy the air , " Alren tells Lisa , and there is a quick cut to a truck spewing exhaust . There are , in addition , the usual number of shafts directed at high-priced psychiatrists , high-pressure businessmen and-everybody 's favorite-middle-class hypocrisy . These are bruised , battered and safe targets that are certain to survive such limp assaults as The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker . <P> J.C .
