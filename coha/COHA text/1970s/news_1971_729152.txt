txt Sgt. Charles E. Hutto , the former Louisiana tarm hand accused of joining in the alleged slaughter of South Vietnamese civilians at Mylai 4 , was acquitted today by a court ? martial jury of six officers . Sergeant Hutto , the third American soldier to be tried for a role in the Mylai incident that occurred almost three years ago , was the second enlisted man to be found not guilty . The other man is still on trial . The panel of officers here took little more than two hours to evaluate the evidence and testimony accumulated in the eight-day trial and reach their verdict , The decision was read to the courtroom by Lieut . Col. Donald M. Laffoon of Highland , Ind. , the president of the jury . As he pronounced the words ; not guilty , Sergeant Hutto smiled broadly . His wife , Brenda , broke into tears and the defense attorneys slapped each other on the bar* . Sergeant Hutto had been charged with assault with in tent to murder at least six South Vietnamese during the combat assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years in prison on conviction . In an impromptu news conference outside the small courtroom , Sergeant Hutto said that I he felt " real good " and said I he had never lost faith in his I attorneys during the courtma rtia I. He said he retained his confidence in the military system of justice and that he planned to " leave the Army as soon as possible , " perhaps as early as next week . The sergeant 's chief attorney , Edward L. Magill of Miami , told newsmen that he had " aged 15 years " in the minute or so it took for the president of the jury to read the panel 's verdict . Under questioning , Mr. Magill said he believed that any // lie Is 2d GI . Found Not Guilty in Alleged Killing of Vietnam Civilians ARMY HUTTO IN ELM DEATHS // forthcoming trials of officers involved in the Mylai case would prove more difficult for the defense . One of those officers , First Lieut . William L , Calley Jr. , a platoon leader with the company that entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man to reach trial , Staff Sgt. David Mitchell , was acquitted at Fort Hood , Texas , last November . There are 10 more Mylai cases pending . During the Hutto trial , the prosecution presented four witnesses and a sworn statement by the defendant . The defense offered nine witnesses and three depositions from South Vietnamese nationals . Before beginning its delibera-hams today , the jury heard the closing arguments of both sides dad a long series of legal instructions read to them by Col , Kenneth A. Howard , the military judge . In his summary , the chief prosecution attorney , Capt . Franklin R. Wurtzel , described the evidence that he said he believed proved that Sergeant Hutto had participated in the shooting of civilians as the infantrymen advanced through the village . Captain Wurtzel repeatedly stressed that the Americans had shot down " old men , women , children and babies ! ' and recalled a statement by the sergeant in his pre-trial declaration to military investigators that " I did n't like the killing ; it was murder . " Rifle-Firing Recalled The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to Investigators , had admitted that he fired his M-16 rifle into a group of people gathered in a clearing in the northern part of the hamlet . The prosecutor told the jury that Sergeant Hutto , with an intelligence quotient of Ill , as testified to by a clinical psychologist , had the mental capacity to distinguish a legal order from an illegal one . " He was trained not only to obey orders , but how to handle prisoners of war , " Captain Wurtzel said , referring to the defense 's contention that the infantryman was following an order from his superior when he fired at the villagers . Mr. Magill was far more emotional in his summation than the military prosecutor . He complained about the frequent mention of " babies " in Captain Wurtzel 's closing argument , saying he regarded this , in football parlance , as a " cheap shot , " " The Government did n't bring one officer or noncommissioned officer who could say that Charley Hutto did anything wrong except that he followed orders , " he said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified for the prosecution as " nondescript G.I. 's " and pointed out that none could say he saw Sergeant Hutto actually shoot people . Mr. Magill took issue with the prosecution contention that the sergeant was a " reasonable man " able to differentiate right from wrong . " This reasonable man had no training in disobeying orders , imagine that , " he said , Then , becoming even more sardonic , he said that Sergeant Hutto " had confidence in his officers ; he surely was gullible , was n't he ? " Turning to the prosecution , Mr. Magill said that during the combat assault on the hamlet the sergeant was " scared . " " He was not one of these cool cats sitting here in a courtroom analyzing orders , " he said . Referring to the highranking officers who planned and commanded the attack , the defense lawyer said that " if the fellows running that show were n't happy , all they had to do was to call it off . " Then , his voice dropping , he told the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other good men in other wars fixed their saddle bags , sucked in their guts , picked up their packs , flicked their rifle safeties off and , when ordered , went off to battle , many of them marching into eternity . " " If an illegal order was given in this case , " he concluded , " it was n't because Charlie Hutto had failed the Army , but that the Army had failed Charlie Hutto. "
