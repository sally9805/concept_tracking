Skillfully stroking his way through $200,000 worth of Pepsi-Cola cans , not to mention weather out of Ice Station Zebra , Bjorn Borg proved at the Grand Slam of Tennis that if you punish a child enough he 'll learn to do things right . // What Borg finally learned to do last Sunday afternoon in a Boca Raton , Fla. condominium nirvana called Boca West , which seemed more like Klondike South , was defeat Jimmy Connors . In their eight previous matches Borg had won only once  --  the first time they met back in 1973  --  but this time he combined well-chosen lobs and a clever little low backhand chip shot with his characteristic looping topspin forehand to upset Connors 6-4 , 5-7 , 6-3. // The victory avenged Borg 's only significant loss of 1976 , the U.S. Open , but more important was the way he threw the monkey of self-doubt off his back . No one stroke or series of points could do that . Steel will could , and did . " The difference this time ? " Borg said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Heretofore , Borg always has been a man against the field , a boy against Connors . And in the late gloom of the second set it looked as if he would fall apart again . // Here Borg was , having won the first set and ahead 4-3 in the second , with three break points against Connors ' serve and a chance for a 5-3 lead . But Connors took his opponent 's lobs out of the dark sky and pounded them clear for the game . Here Borg was with a 5-4 lead and three match points , but he failed again  --  once on an easy backhand drive off a short ball with Connors frozen at the net . The ball struck the tape and fell backward , whereupon Borg smashed it with his racket savagely into the net . // It was a unique display of emotion for the normally stolid 20-year-old , and he threw away the set in the next two games . The teen-age Borg would have been finished then . But this Borg came charging back in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To withstand Connors ' break back in the fifth . To get the key break in the sixth on two gorgeous backhand passing shots , and ultimately to run out the match . // " I play him high ones , low ones , " said Borg . " This is unbelievable big win for me. " // And a rich one . Borg 's $100,000 first prize was more than the entire amount he earned in winning his 1976 Wimbledon and WCT titles . Connors ' winner 's paycheck of $30,000 at Forest Hills was less than his runner-up Grand Slam take of $50,000. // With all its loot , Grand Slam could have been the ultimate video cum lettuce sports special . Yet this particular event had some legitimacy . To begin with , the Grand Slam had the winners of the four most prestigious tournaments in the world  --  Borg ( Wimbledon and WCT ) , Connors ( Forest Hills ) and Adriano Panatta ( the French Open ) . Since Borg had won two of the big four , the fourth player was Manuel Orantes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Prix Masters championship . // Next , the final match was televised live right then rather than seven months later in between the 2 a.m . Veg-o-matic commercials . // Thirdly , the tournament was conducted in a thoroughly professional manner by the sponsor , Pepsi-Cola , which , because of its nine-year sponsorship of a worldwide junior tennis program , as well as lessons in 45 inner U.S. cities , believes it has no apologies to make to tennis . // And finally , unlike many events of this nature , the players were on the scene well ahead of time . They practiced diligently . They were coddled only to certain limits . When Connors made some noise about refusing to play in the windy , 40 ? first-day chill , he was told in no uncertain terms he would play . // As Pepsi publicist Joe Block said in between hitting some forehands of his own in one of the clinics his company provided for clients , " Hardly a tennis tournament goes by that Pepsi is not involved in putting money back into the sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tournaments . It 's just that when you can get four of the top guys in the world , guaranteed , why take pot luck on the finals of some tournament ? " // But is it a TV show , Joe ? // " If it was a TV tape , we would n't do it . " Block said . Then he grinned . " But if there was no TV , it would n't exist either . " // Naturally the players loved the Grand Slam . And defended it . " Listen , " said Connors , " the public is getting great tennis cheap . Would anyone outside Palm Beach call $20 tickets " cheap " ? I 'm on the title trail now . I just want to win events that will put me in the history books . I think in time the Grand Slam will be one of those events . " // Panatta thought otherwise . " Grand Slam is fun , yes , " he said . " Maybe it can be No. 1 of four-man exhibitions . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panatta dug his huge serve into the slate-gray clay to come from behind and nearly upset Borg . Having split the first two sets , they struggled through four service breaks in the third before Panatta led 5-4 and held match point three times . But in a game that went to seven deuces , Borg held firm . On the third match point against him , all Borg could do was shiver in his tracks and watch as Panatta aimed a passing shot down the line . But the ball hit the net cord and bounced back . Borg held two ads before winning the game for 5-5 . Then he ran off eight straight points to take the set and match 6-2 , 4-6 , 7-5. // Borg was in the midst of an important period of adjustment at Boca Raton . He and his fianc ? e , the Romanian player Mariana Simionescu , were sharing a villa with Borg 's coach , Lenart Bergelin , in the final days of an idyll which would end when Bjorn and Mariana would have to leave on separate tennis circuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They practiced together and ate Mariana-cooked meals in their villa every night . On the other side of paradise Connors was enjoying a rare piece of solitude . Unencumbered by his usual footmen , lackeys and gofers , he played golf and kibitzed with children . The fact that he was unaccompanied by everybody 's favorite sports starlet , Marjie Wallace , who did not arrive until Sunday , gave rise to inevitable questions about his relationship with Chris Evert , who was at home in Fort Lauderdale 20 miles down the road . // " Chris and I are doing fine , " Connors said . " We talk on the phone a lot . She does her thing and I do mine . We 're good friends . People should understand that . " // Connors also said he was " into seriousness now . Really , seriously , " he insisted . This was just before he postponed practice to catch the Three Stooges on TV and to play minibike chicken with his partner-in-seriousness , Ilie Nastase. // Connors and Orantes had divided straight-set victories in their previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close , it was almost totally devoid of impressive shot-making. // Because of the wind and chill the players were encumbered by windbreakers and sweaters . Entire games would pass with no clear winners struck . Orantes won the first set tiebreak only because he made three unforced errors to Connors ' five . Then Connors won five straight games to take the second set 6-2. // Neither player was enjoying himself , and Connors seemed utterly without motivation . Orantes served for the match at 5-3 but , severely hampered by a cramp in his left thigh , played four loose points to drop his serve . // Orantes carried on despite the pain and came to match point in the next game , but Connors did the kind of thing he always seems to do in the crunch . He aced his man . After Jimbo held for 5-all and led 15-40 in the 11th game , Orantes pulled up , unable to move . // Connors jumped the net and started massaging Orantes ' leg . " Can he sit down to rest ? " Connors asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . // Orantes limped off to his default , pausing to shake Blanchard 's hand . // " What an amazing person Manolo is , " she said . " Such pain and hurt and , you know , he 's not a very handsome man . But when he smiled up at me , his look was just , well , beatific. " // Bjorn Borg , the game 's coldest warrior , never has been called beatific . But as he demonstrated at the Grand Slam , he may be ready to be called the best .
