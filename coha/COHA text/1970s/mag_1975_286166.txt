THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR <P> Directed by SYDNEY POLLACK <P> Screenplay by LORENZO SEMPLE JR . and DAVID RAYFIEL <P> A piece of dotty , slightly paranoid intrigue . Three Days of the Condor promises little and keeps its word . It is hard to get indignant about it , or enthusiastic either . There is no clear compliment the movie can be paid without an immediate qualification : it is smooth but forgettable , bearable but brainless . The film has nothing novel to say and nothing to offer except Robert Redford . But the way things work in Hollywood these days , Redford is enough . <P> Three Days of the Condor should be considered not so much as a movie as what Hollywood calls a project . Based on a least-selling novel called Six Days of the Condor , by James Grady , such a project is conceived and comes into being only because Redford agrees to show up in it . Redford is a good , shrewd , sometimes very funny actor , but the fact that movies like Three Days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that occurs to no one . Neither Redford , Director Sydney Pollack ( The Way We Were ) nor any of the assortment of assembled co-stars ( Faye Dunaway , Cliff Robertson , Max von Sydow , John Houseman ) can make material like this better than passable . No one could , and you wonder why anyone bothers . Redford and all his co-stars and all the elaborate production details are aimless embellishment , like putting neon lighting around a void . <P> All these melancholy thoughts occur during Condor because there is little else to think about . Everything in the movie is familiar . Redford appears as Turner , a blithe , intelligent functionary in an unimportant CIA office in New York . He finds all his co-workers slaughtered one day . Figuring that he is next on the list for removal , he takes it on the lam . Turner calls into headquarters for help , but it seems that headquarters wants to kill him too . Everyone wants to kill him , except the melancholy , liquid-eyed Kathy ( Faye Dunaway ) . Redford rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the toilet . He makes it all up to her ( presumably ) by making love to her , an occasion for which he releases her from bondage . <P> After this requisite romantic interlude , Redford goes on the run again , trying to sort the good guys from the bad . The movie is predictable enough to pass as a game of fill-in-the-blanks ; audiences could be invited to contribute their own gimmicks . Condor is so pat , however , that no matter what extravagances of plot were supplied , everything would still come out the same way in the end : empty .
