ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE AMERICA , says the U.S. Public Health Service 's bright new slogan . Yet as the nation 's highly touted program against swine flu began last week , most Americans who wanted to take the slogan 's advice stood only to get a cold shoulder . Despite the Ford Administration 's original vow to vaccinate 200 million Americans against the dread virus-a form of which possibly caused some half-million deaths in the U.S. alone during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic-only a few health centers round the country were ready to give the shots . Indeed , federal distribution of the vaccine was so erratic that a health official in Portland , Ore. , remarked : " We did n't even know we 'd received a batch until we read about it in the newspaper . " <P> Last week 's snafus were hardly surprising . Since President Ford announced the mass immunization effort last March , it has been snarled in confusion and controversy , including a hassle over whether the Government would protect the four manufacturers of the vaccine against possible lawsuits resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , production is far behind schedule . By November , when the flu season normally begins , the companies will have produced only about one-quarter of the 215 million doses originally expected . Availability aside , the vaccine 's effectiveness remains questionable . Experts ' estimates of the degree of protection it will provide range from 20% to 90% . <P> Some doctors , of course , are still skeptical that there is anything to guard against . Since the virus first appeared among Army recruits at Fort Dix last winter-one of whom died-there has not been a single confirmed additional case of swine flu . Either the infection is not very contagious , say the scoffers , or the Fort Dix flu cases were just a medical fluke . <P> Nonetheless , since the flu season - to say nothing of the election-is only weeks off , federal officials are taking no chances . As the vaccine is produced , it is being shipped to the states in quantities roughly proportional to their population . State health officials , in turn , are making shots available through a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , even special clinics set up at shopping centers . Under the $135 million program , the vaccine will be free . Private doctors will be allowed to charge an administering fee , but it probably will be modest . The Medical Association of Georgia , for example , has suggested physicians charge $1.50 , the same amount it costs the state to give the shots . <P> The federal program is providing two types of vaccine : monovalent , which offers protection only against swine flu , and bivalent , which also contains vaccine against last year 's prevailing A/Victoria influenza strain . Because the virus used in producing the vaccine is cultured in eggs , the shots should not be taken by those who are severely allergic to eggs . The current recommendations of federal health officials : <P> R For those 65 years and older or chronically ill , who could be hardest hit by any epidemic-bivalent shots . The officials are also advising ( but not providing ) a shot against an older flu strain . Hong Kong B , which could also reappear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 and over , including pregnant women - monovalent shots .
