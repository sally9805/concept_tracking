In the long and colorful history of railroading , few tracks have been laid any faster than those of the Tanzam Railway , which is currently moving southwestward from the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam to the copper belt of Zambia at the extraordinary rate of three miles a day . The 1,162-mile line , financed with the help of a $402 million interest-free loan from China , is being built by 15,000 Chinese , laboring alongside 35,000 Zambians and Tanzanians . The hardest part of the job - 21 tunnels , 200 bridges and some 1,000 culverts in Tanzania - has already been completed . The entire line is due to be finished late next year - more than 18 months ahead of schedule . <P> The railroad will strengthen Tanzania 's economy by opening up the southern part of the country . It will have an even more dramatic effect on landlocked Zambia , which is the world 's largest exporter of copper ( an estimated 750,000 tons this year ) . Prosperous though it is , however , Zambia has been uncomfortably dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories of Angola and Mozambique - since its independence in 1964 . <P> Early this year , Rhodesia closed its borders with Zambia on the ground that Zambians had been aiding black guerrillas within Rhodesia . The government of Prime Minister Ian Smith specifically exempted Zambian copper from the blockade . Zambia 's President Kenneth Kaunda , 49 , decided , however , to stand on principle and refused to export his country 's copper via Rhodesia . A month later , when the Rhodesians lifted their blockade , Kaunda imposed one of his own . He has refrained ever since from importing or exporting any goods through the rebel British colony . <P> Instead , he has relied on existing rail lines that pass through Portuguese territory and on the highway northeast to Tanzania . The blockade is forcing Zambia to pay an extra $150 million in import-export costs , and it has led to a few shortages . " Luxury living has been given its marching orders , " says Kaunda . <P> But the country has fared surprisingly well - largely because the price of copper has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good these days , in fact , that it borrowed $150 million in Eurodollars last month . It then proceeded to pay out $226 million to retire the long-term bonds it had issued in 1969 when Kaunda took over 51% of the country 's leading mining companies . <P> The government subsequently said it would scrap the lucrative management contracts that had been worth $40 million a year to the leading copper companies , Anglo-American of South Africa and American Metal Climax . <P> Extra Clout . Kaunda 's action has strengthened his position at home as the man who took the mines out of the hands of foreigners . Not that he really needed the extra clout . Earlier this year , Kaunda pushed through a new constitution that turned the country into a one-party state - the one party being his own United National Independence Party . <P> Consequently , in the elections to be held later this year , he will need only a simple " yes " majority vote to be elected to a third five-year term .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
