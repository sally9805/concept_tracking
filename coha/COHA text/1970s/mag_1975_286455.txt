Before the first glinting rays of Sunday hit the steel mills surrounding Hammond , Ind. , the vanguard of 1,000 bus volunteers check in . Soon 230 blue-and-white First Baptist Church buses are plying routes across northern Indiana and South Side Chicago , and before the morning is over the drivers will have hauled as many as 10,000 persons to what foot-high signs on the sides of the buses hail as the WORLD 'S LARGEST SUNDAY SCHOOL . <P> The claim is rock solid for the U.S. , if not the world . According to Christian Life magazine 's annual survey , no church comes close to First Baptist in Sunday school attendance . It draws an incredible average weekly turnout of nearly 14,000. * <P> Hammond 's Baptists , hard-shell fundamentalist , use liberal doses of Barnumism that would make less exuberant Christians blush . A " battle " between two competing bus teams , spurred on by bands and flags , rocketed attendance last March 16 to a record 30,560 . This fall 's attendance drive has featured a man on stilts inviting squealing moppets into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sixth-graders . Past bait has included zoo trips , picnics , even horseback rides . <P> " We 'll trade a horseback ride any time for the opportunity to teach the Bible , " says Bus Minister Jim Vineyard , who marshals the weekly ingathering . " We 've been accused of bribing kids to come to church , but a bribe is a payment to get someone to do wrong . We 're getting them to do right . " <P> With soul-saving zeal , First Baptist welcomes deaf and retarded children , as well as a surprising number of Chicago street toughs , some of whom come equipped with clubs , knives and chains that have to be wrested away from them . For small troublemakers , Vineyard keeps a paddle handy . Explains one deacon blandly : " We ram respect and discipline down their throats . " And more . First Baptist insists on short hair ( " cut so that it is at least one finger-width above the eyebrows " ) . Primness also counts at the church 's elementary and high schools and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not sit on a piano bench next to a girl , or touch her . <P> " I think a lot of people in this country are hungry for what we call decency , " says Pastor Jack Hyles , 49 , the preacher-impresario who made First Baptist No. 1 . If decency alone will not hold a crowd , he makes sure theatrical oratory will . In the course of Sunday worship , Hyles shouts , whispers , jokes , cries . " It 's a rare sermon when I do n't weep , " he says . <P> Spellbinder Hyles was anything but that in his first stuttering try at preaching in 1947 . " Elijah blushed and Heaven 's flag flew at half-mast for three days , " he says . In classic bootstrap style , Hyles proceeded to enroll in speech courses while clerking at J.C . Penney 's in Marshall , Texas . Before long , he was wowing audiences with a folksy , rip-roaring delivery . He took a church and was summoned to the Hammond pulpit in 1959.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
