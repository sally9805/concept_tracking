High school football rivalries in Texas sometimes have a quality of tribal warfare . This month two old and furious small-town enemies , Premont and Los Fresnos , were tangling at Premont . With less than two minutes remaining and Los Fresnos leading 14-12 , a brawl erupted among the players on the field . <P> One of the first to join officials in restoring order was a Premont policeman . The cop waded into the fight and sprayed his chemical Mace into the faces of seven of Los Fresnos ' first-string players , who fell to the ground screaming and holding their eyes . <P> They were guided back to their bench for treatment . The Premont team , with the opposition disabled by this exercise of frontier sportsmanship , completed a 55-yd. pass and kicked a field goal to win 15-14 . To compound the offense , Premont school officials later sent Los Fresnos a bill for $1,200-for the damage that the angry losers caused when they tried to tear up the locker room .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
