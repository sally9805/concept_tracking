FRANKFURTER can be found just below Frankenstein in the dictionary . It can also be found immediately beneath contempt in Ralph Nader 's vast lexicon of villains . To Nader , the ABM and the smart bomb are scarcely more lethal than a chain of processed sausages . Hot dogs , insists the consumer advocate , are " among America 's deadliest missiles . " New York City 's Consumer Affairs Commissioner Bess Myerson agrees : " After I found out what was in hot dogs , I stopped eating them . " This people 's entre , this frank companion of alfresco meals and ball games-can it really be a finger-shaped monster ? So it appears . <P> When a German-born restaurateur named Charles Feltman first popularized the frankfurter on a roll 100 years ago , the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce refused to endorse the sobriquet " hot dog . " They thought it might evoke notions of processed mongrel . Today the public has less fanciful worries . According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , since 1937 the frankfurter has gone from 19% fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The rest is water , salt , spices and preservatives . ) This deterioration is yet another of technology 's ambiguous gifts . <P> Not long ago , for example , it was difficult to pulverize poultry cheaply ; now hot-dog manufacturers enthusiastically chicken out , cramming up to 15% of their sausages with bird parts . Poultry is one of the more appetizing ingredients . Federal law allows hot dogs to contain such animal features as esophagi , ears , lips and snouts . In the words of Robert Benchley : " Ai n't it offal ? " And even these ingredients do not exhaust the bad news . Hot dogs are brimming with additives , including sodium nitrite , sodium acid pyrophosphate and glucona delta lactone . Without such chemicals , the hot dog would lose its pink blush and turn the color of unwashed sneakers . The wiener may also contain " binders , " like dried milk , cereal or starchy vegetable flour . According to Consumers Union , there can also be occasional insect parts and rodent hairs . Moreover , frankfurters are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the purest of all-beef kosher franks . Discarding fat , water , etc. , what protein remains comes to more than $10 per pound . For that you can get truffles . Or 4 Ibs. of filet mignon . Or 8 Ibs. of hamburger . <P> ? <P> For all its critics , the hot dog , like any other American institution , does have its loyal defenders . " If I were an Oscar Mayer wiener , " insists the jingle , " everyone would be in love with me . " Edwin Anderson , president of the Zion Foods Corp. , salutes the frankfurter with a serious mien . " Hot dogs , " he maintains , " are still the American 's favorite meat food . Let 's compare apples with apples . The hot dog is a ready-to-eat product and should be compared with other similar products rather than with hamburger , which loses 30% to 40% of its weight in cooking . " Adds Michael Levine of Continental Seasoning : " There are fewer chemicals in franks than in most of your cereals , mustard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand grilling . Franks present should only be compared with franks past . As for mustard , it goes on those dubious wieners , adding its adulterates to theirs .
