" St. Louis , Oct. 7 , 1979  --  Baby Doll Jacobson 's two triples and Ken Williams ' three RBIs today paced the slugging 1922 St. Louis Browns to a 12-2 romp over the 1975 Boston Red Sox . The win gives the Browns a commanding 3-1 lead in the World Series . Jim Rice 's solo homer in the eighth was the only bright spot for Boston , as the Bosox offense continued its Series slump . " // This kind of ultimate baseball fantasy is not beyond your reach . You , too , can discover how a lineup of Baby Doll Jacobson , Ken Williams and George Sisler would stack up against Yastrzemski , Fisk and Lynn , et al . To do so , you need neither a computer nor a crystal ball . Just join the aficionados of " All-Star Baseball , " a simple board game designed by 75-year-old Ethan Allen , former Yale University baseball coach and outfielder in the 1930s for the Giants and Reds . The major pieces of the venerable game , first issued in 1941 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and all , two metal spinners and cardboard batting discs listing hitting possibilities for each player . ASB cultists , from seven-year-olds to the middle-aged , can be found throughout the country spinning homers , strikeouts and singles . They play the game religiously , collecting batting discs , concocting teams and leagues and recording reams of statistics . // The discs are tailored to individual batting performances and divided into sectors for various kinds of hits and outs . The game casts the pitcher in a role almost as vestigial as the appendix . Pitchers are only valued for their hitting ability . Thus a Bucky Walters or Gene Bearden is desired , but a Sandy Koufax is merely an offensive albatross . Because ASB includes all of baseball 's purest hitters , players can devise lineups of unimaginable batting prowess . For all those baseball " never weres , " the game offers a kick equivalent to slamming a slow-pitch softball over the leftfielder 's head . // I was introduced to All-Star Baseball during my formative years in Brooklyn in the heyday of The Boys of Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Ethan Allen 's publisher answered my letters and mailed me a pack of batting discs of contemporary stars or such alltime All-Stars as Lou Gehrig or Hack Wilson . However , to my disappointment , Ethan Allen never included a Carl Furillo disc among his selections because Furillo did n't give Allen permission . // When my twin sons , Todd and Drew , had matured sufficiently to appreciate the mysteries of ASB , I dusted off the old game board but was saddened to learn some valuable discs were missing , ranging from that of the extraordinary Ty Cobb to the less memorable Sid Gordon . When I sent away for a new Wrigley Field game board and an updated set of discs ( if unavailable at retail stores , send a check for $6.10 to CADACO , Inc. , 310 W. Polk St. , Chicago , Ill. 60607 ) , I also received a subscription form to the ASB News . I sent in the form , and a short time later my first copy of the magazine arrived . What a bonanza ! ASB News prints in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of matchups and leagues , as well as the personal confessions of ASB worshipers . One issue gave front-page coverage to the saga of a man over 40 , who wrote , " There I was in a cold sweat everytime I played All-Star Baseball , afraid that someone would discover I was playing games . Surreptitiously I would wait until everyone was asleep or out of the house , then I 'd quietly slide my game from its hiding place , and to the den I 'd sneak . Closing the door , the excitement began . The great names ... the calculated spinners ... the thrill of imagination ... the crack of the bat ! // " If the wife , the relatives , the friends found out , they would say , ' What a waste of time .... You 've gone nuts . ' That 's why for five years and some 1,250 games I was a closet player ... afraid to come out into the open . Since I discovered ASB News , I 've learned there are a lot of nuts like me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open . I 'm proud to have this great hobby . Now I can openly play six games a day , keep statistics , make discs , join mail leagues and participate in tournaments . " // Another correspondent told of the formation of a four-man league in the Washington , D.C. area which meets every two weeks , plays six games a night and includes a draft of players from the 1930-32 era . He wrote , " We have had three meetings so far . The first was to get to know each other and discuss the type of league we wanted . The second meeting was the draft . We opened the season two weeks later . I was nervous just driving over there . " One durable reader replayed the entire 616-game 1947 National League schedule , with the New York Giants , rather than the Brooklyn Dodgers , winning the pennant . // For those who aspire to outdo Ethan Allen 's inventiveness , the magazine serves as a forum for proposals on pitching , fielding and even wind-velocity factors that can be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man told ASB News , " I have been playing ASB since 1950 and have not changed any of the rules that applied then . " // Perhaps the most valuable service performed by ASB News is its devotion to the interests of the batting-disc collector . Because I was looking to restore my lost discs and add a few which had eluded me , I found the trading-post section a gold mine  --  a chance to regain a Ty Cobb or a Sid Gordon . What could match the satisfaction of finally landing a Chick Hafey or restoring Roger Maris to one 's collection ? // As with some contemporary magazines , the highlight of ASB News is its centerfold . It consists of hard-paper sheets of 24 batting discs , compiled by the editors , of the most obscure and contemporary big-leaguers . In one issue , ASB News surprised its readers with discs of minor league batting wizards Ox Eckhardt ( Pacific Coast League ) and Rocky Nelson ( International League ) . I wonder whether Ethan Allen 's lofty standards were offended . The magazine also offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Gun ) Gettel , Bud Podbielan , Toby Atwell , the 1922 St. Louis Browns ( second-place finishers to the Yankees ) and , yes , even a set of Japanese stars . // ASB fans are not only ardent , they often are also persons of broader interests . Take the Los Angeles reader who answered my ad for a batting-disc trade by telephoning me in New Jersey . " Hello , this is J.W. calling from Los Angeles to answer your ad in ASB News . " // " You 're calling all the way from Los Angeles just to answer my ad ? " I asked incredulously . // " Yes , " he said , " I really have a thing for discs of 1950s Giants , and I was wondering whether you had any you could trade . " // I did have original prints of Henry Thompson and Larry Jansen discs , but since it 's unthinkable for a dedicated ASB collector to part with his only disc of any player ( even if the 1950s Giants were anathema to him ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.W. unburdened himself about his most burning quest . " Look , " he said with considerable passion , " what I 've really been searching for over the past 20 years is a Red Barber Baseball Game . " That was a dice game , produced about 30 years ago while Red Barber resided in the catbird seat as sportscaster for the Brooklyn Dodgers. // " Well , matter of fact , " I said , feeling like the Good Samaritan , " I recently retrieved an old Red Barber Baseball Game board from my parents ' garage sale and would be glad to sell it to you . However , the board split and had to be taped together , and all the players and the ball are lost . " // " I do n't care about that , " J.W. said with some agitation . " All I want is the game board , taped or not . I ca n't wait till you send it to me so I can begin playing with it , " he pleaded . " I 'll pay you anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , prevented me from gouging him for more than $5 . ( My children , to whom I had promised the proceeds of the sale , wanted me to sell it for much more . ) But I made the mistake of mailing the game board third-class , and when it had not arrived after 10 days , J.W. anxiously called me again from Los Angeles . Two more transcontinental telephone calls and 40 days later he wrote me a letter advising me how upset the delay had made him , and how despairing he was of ever owning a Red Barber Baseball Game board . He insisted that I put postal tracers out for the wayward board . Another month passed , and J.W. called again , this time to report that the game board had arrived safely in Los Angeles . The result was a quest 's fulfillment on the West Coast , and a Good Samaritan 's relief on the East Coast . // With more than 500 ASB discs in my collection , one might think I would be satisfied . But there are always more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jerry Coleman discs have disappeared over the years , and I 'd dearly like them back in my deck . Can anyone out there help me ?
