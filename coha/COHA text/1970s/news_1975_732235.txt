txt A State Supreme Court Justice yesterday dismissed a major indictment against Irving Goldman , the city 's former Cultural Affairs Commissioner , declaring that Maurice H. Nadjari , the special state prosecutor , had neither the evidence nor the authority to ask a special grand jury to indict Mr. Goldman . In a sharply worded opinion , ) the justice , John M. Murtagh. who is empowered to hear all of Mr. Nadjari 's cases , said that the manner in which Mr. Nadjari had handled the evidence in the Goldman case " borders on contempt . " The justice said he was also concerned about Mr. Nadjari 's " possible abuse of authority " in other pending investigations . Thus , he directed that a private conference be held soon among himself , Mr. Nadjari and Louis J. Lefkowitz , the State Attorney General , who formally designated Mr. Nadjari to his post in September 1972 at the urging of Nelson A. Rockefeller , who was then Governor . Presumably one of the topics to be raised will be the status of the continuing investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's Transit Authority of more than $500,000 and stealing $225,000 from a vendingmachine company . The state 's bribery , grand-larceny , conspiracy and perjury indictments stemmed from Mr. Goldman 's stewardship of two companies , the Jola Candy Corporation and the Interborough News Company , which at one point operated all of the more than 6,000 vending machines in the subways . One month later , a Federal // grand jury returned indictments on similar charges . That case is pending . Mr. Goldman 's lawyers moved last week to have the Federal indictment dismissed . Mr. Goldman could not be reached for comment yesterday , but his lawyer , Arthur S. Friedman , said , " We are gratified that Irving Goldman 's position has been completely vindicated by the court . " In his decision , Justice Murtagh said : " Not only has the special . prosecutor 's conduct in this investigation involved an assumption of authority that clearly was not within the Governor 's proclamation , but also the investigation necessarily detracted from his performing the responsibilities entrusted to him . " This court has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the assumption of authority not conferred upon him , but also that he . perform the duties entrusted to him . " After reading the two-and-ahalf page opinion , a spokesman for Mr. Nadjari 's office issued a terse statement : " The meeting requested will take place . Meanwhile , the special prosecutor is considering and appeal . " Under the executive order creating Mr. Nadjari 's office , the special prosecutor has been empowered to supersede the city 's five District Attorneys in investigating and prosecuting corruption within the criminaljustice system . Traditionally , this has meant that Mr. Nadjari may look into cases involving the police , prosecutors and the judiciary . However , as cases have come his way , Mr. Nadjari has sought and usually won the right to define and expand his jurisdiction to investigate other enforcement agencies , for example , the State Department of Motor Vehicles . But from the outset of the Goldman investigation 19 mnrithc aorn Mr. Narimri Innsdictional claim in this case has been a matter of debate between his office and the justice . Indeed , in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry . into Mr. Goldman 's finances . At the time , Justice Murtagh told Joseph A. Philips , Mr. Nadjari 's chief assistant  --  who has personally directed the Goldman case  --  that there was no " authority for this investigation . " Justice Murtagh recalled in his decision yesterday that he ordered the grand jury to resume its inquiry on Jan. 6 , 1975 , after " the special prosecutor furnished to the court minimal evidence as to illegal payments to Transit Department employees . " While the justice did not say so , it is known that a member of the Transit Authority police force gave evidence to the special grand jury that later led the panel to focus on allegations that transit officials and transit policemen accepted payoffs from Jola for protection for coin pickups from subway vending machines . It was possible corruption among Transit Authority police officers that gave Mr. Nadjari 's grand jury the power to investigate . Thus far , the grand jury has returned no indictments against transit police officers , although Mr. Nadjari has said in the past that " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , in March , the grand jury issued its first indictment of Mr. Goldman . Then , last month , Mr. Goldman was accused in a new indictment , this time concerning his activities as president of the Shubert Foundation , a nonprofit corp &; ration with control over the vast Shubert theatrical and real-estate holdings . In the latest indictment , Mr. Goldman is charged with entering into a conspiracy to bribe witnesses to prevent their being subpoenaed by the Nadjari grand jury . Dismissal Requested Meanwhile , Mr. Goldman 's lawyers had moved to dismiss the Goldman indictment on a variety of grounds , among them that Mr. Nadjari did not have the authority to prosecute ? On Sept. 17 , oral arguments were held on this motion before Justice Murtagh , and he reserved decision . In preparation for his ruling , the justice then read the grand jury 's minutes of the case , and concluded that his initial concern over jurisdiction " was fully warranted . " " The special prosecutor was wholly without authority to present the case to the grand jury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In light of the court 's expression of concern in this matter , expressed very clearly on Oct. 16 , 1974 , the submission of the evidence on which the indictment is predicated bor. : . ders on contempt . " Several Condemnations - . In the past , several of M " Nadjari 's cases , particularly the cases against Thomas J. Mackell , the former Queens District Attorney , and United States Customs Judge Paul ' P. Rao Sr. , have been the subject of judicial condemnations . Challenges to these cases have come , however , by way of appeals courts and not by way of the Supreme Court justice assigned to hear Mr. Nadjari 's cases . Last March , for example , the Appellate Division , Second Department , unanimously reversed Mr. Mackell 's jury conviction ' in part because of Mr. Nadjari 's overzealousness . The Mackell case is now on appeal . The same appellate court upheld the Rao perjury indictment even as it , described Mr. Nadjari 's undercover tactics as " illegal , outrageous and intolerable . " The Rao case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , criticism of Mr. Nadjari has centered on the methods he has used in obtaining indictments . While Justice Murtagh referred to " possible abuse of authority " on Mr. Nadjari 's part , he stopped short of detailing specific instances , if any , of the methods used in the Goldman case .
