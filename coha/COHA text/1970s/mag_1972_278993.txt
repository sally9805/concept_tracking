HE got only one or two bylines . He rarely traveled with campaign caravans or attended presidential press conferences . But for the past eight years , TIME 'S Washington bureau would have been hard-pressed to operate without Edwin Goodpaster . As news editor and deputy bureau chief , Goodpaster was the executive officer , deploying the troops of the 23-man bureau . He also played copy editor , assignment maker , staff psychiatrist , and domestic-affairs counselor . When gas masks and helmets were needed for reporters covering the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King , Goodpaster found them . Or Arctic underwear for reporters on their way to Greenland . <P> Goodpaster came to TIME in 1964 after stints as city editor of the Minneapolis Tribune and managing editor of the now-extinct San Fernando Valley Times . But he worried about Washington journalism becoming too big , too separated from the people , and he decided to act on his misgivings . <P> Next week he goes off to Whitehall , Wis. ( pop . 1,500 ) , to be owner , publisher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Whitehall Times ( circ. 2,050 ) . " With a little paper , I felt I could find the people-to-people relationship I wanted , " he explains .

" <P> For McGovern and McGovern watchers , it was the best of weeks and the worst of weeks . Nothing is harder to cover than uncertainty-so TIME reporters covered just about everybody . Neil MacNeil bird-dogged McGovern through every between-vote interlude in the Senate lobbies , found him and Hubert Humphrey almost guiltily sneaking off to the " neutral office " of the Secretary of the Senate . MacNeil learned from Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff that McGovern had called one morning at near dawn to ask him to intercede with Ted Kennedy , then had called back an hour later to offer the job to Ribicoff himself . John Austin , who was assigned to Ed Muskie , staked out the Senator 's home in Bethesda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was the only reporter on the plane when Muskie flew to Maine to discuss the matter with his wife . When reporters rushed to Hyannis Port after Sargent Shriver finally became the choice , they found TIME 'S Kay Huff had been dispatched there well ahead of the pack . Because of this sustained contact , TIME 'S correspondents won from the solicited candidates unique and intimate candor about the personal and practical factors that went into their decisions . As for the art department , TIME had readied cover pictures of twelve possible contenders .
