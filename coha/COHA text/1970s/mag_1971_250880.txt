During the next few months , some 8.5 million Americans will receive a check that is almost as rare these days as a winning lottery ticket : a partial refund on their automobile insurance premiums . The lucky recipients are policyholders of State Farm Mutual , the nation 's largest auto insurer , which revealed this week a $112.2 million underwriting profit for the first six months of 1971 , compared with an $18.4 million loss in the same period last year . The company 's overall earnings after taxes have shot up to $108 million - an astonishing 500% improvement on last year 's first-half figures . <P> <P> Because State Farm is a mutual insurer , in effect owned by its policyholders , its officers must use the profits either to lower rates or make refunds . State Farm chose to make refunds , since lower rates might be hard to raise if profits fall in the future . But the effect is the same . All together , the company will distribute $30 million to policyholders in 31 states and the District of Columbia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The profits of some other large auto underwriters are also expanding , though far less dramatically than State Farm 's . The payoff may lead to the first lowering of auto insurance rates since World War II , or at least a leveling off . Among companies that are considering or have already announced selective cuts are the Insurance Co. of North America , Hartford Fire Insurance Co. and Illinois ' Kemper Group . Despite the steady rise in medical and repair costs-which have not even reversed the trend toward higher rates in some states-a number of companies have lately experienced a notable drop in the frequency of claims . Officials of State Farm , which insures one out of every seven U.S. cars , report that claims during the first six months of the year fell 7% for bodily injuries , 12% for medical payments , 8% for property damage and 9% for collisions . <P> Why ? One explanation is that the nation 's long auto-safety campaign , which has led to major improvements in equipment , road design and driver education , is finally paying off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. history , the number of automobile fatalities declined slightly , to 55,300 . So far this year the toll is still lower by a little . Top executives at State Farm are convinced that another factor is at least partly responsible for their good fortune : everybody else 's bad fortune . In short , says Vice President Thomas Morrill , " the frequency of claims is directly tied to the state of the economy and thus tends to decline in a recession . "
