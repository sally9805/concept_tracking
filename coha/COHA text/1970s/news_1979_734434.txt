txt While losing popularity at home , America 's tobacco industry is pushing ahead with aggressive marketing and sales in the developing nations of the world . A survey commissioned by the tobacco industry and made public this week reveals more and more nonsmokers are demanding cigarettes not be lit in their presence . Last week , the US Department of Agriculture reported that per capita consumption of tobacco in the nation is at a 46-year low . But in a related report , the department 's Foreign Agricultural Service said total world tobacco use is expected to increase again in 1980 . The Tobacco Institute , the industry lobby , says the survey made public this week is 18 months old and any current conclusions from it would be " speculative . " However , antismoking groups point out that attitudes against tobacco consumption undoubtedly would have hardened in those 18 months . Tobacco , nevertheless , remains an $18 billion industry in the United States . Second-largest producer of tobacco be- hind the People 's Republic of China , the US is the world 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobacco Institute says in 1978 these exports contributed $1.69 billion to the US balance of payments . Tobacco companies are waging aggressive advertising campaigns in the emerging nations of the world , and the Agriculture Department still subsidizes overseas sales through its " Food for Peace " program to needy countries . As a result , the largest increases in smoking have occurred in the poorer areas of the world , the Agriculture Department reports . // 10 without permission . From page .1 Smoking : down in US , up overseas " Throughout most of the third world , it seems , the cigarette bespeaks privilege and knowledge , " Erik Eckholm writes in a study conducted for the Worldwatch Institute . Higher-tar-and-nicotine cigarettei are favored in Africa and Latin America , where advertisements emphasize masculinity believed to be associated with smoking these cigarettes . While the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare was pursuing the antismoking campaign begun by its former secretary , Joseph A. Califano Jr. , the Agriculture Department was spending about $65 million in 1977 to carry out its price-support program and to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco . A combination of production quotas and govern- ? ment-held loan stocks helps keep tobacco prices at their current levels . In mid-1977 , these stocks were worth $659 million . In the US , low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes , which the Tobacco Institute says constitute 36 to 40 percent of all sales , reflect the nation 's growing concern with the hazards of ingesting noxious fumes . Reports continue to be pro- duced underscoring the dangers faced by smokers . On Oct. 22 , the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America released the results of a 15-year study that found smokers ' death rates were double that of nonsmokers . The trend toward drawing lines between smokers and nonsmokers upsets the Tobacco Institute , which has been conducting a magazine advertising campaign pleading for more tolerance from nonsmokers . The survey on nonsmokers ' attitudes , says William Kloepfer , senior vice-president of the Tobacco Institute , points up " the social bias which has been produced by the emotional and subjective propaganda bombardment from certain government officials and others for the past 15 years . " The survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those contacted thought cigarette smoking probably is hazardous to the health of nonsmokers . Four years ago , only 46 percent felt that way . The survey also said favorable attitudes toward the tobacco industry are at a low , and the majority of those *questioned said restaurants and other public places should have separate facilities for nonsmokers.
