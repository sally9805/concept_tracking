WALKING PAPERS by Sandra Hochman. 211 pages . Viking . $6.95 . <P> To what has become one of the decade 's most popular questions , Freud admitted having no answer : What does a woman want ? One would like to have been able to slip him a copy of this first novel-a long , first-person , Portnoyesque rant that seems to wedge at least 30 years of neurotic female yearning into its emancipated pages . <P> The heroine , Diana Balooka , wants everything , wants it now and in generous portions . To be loved by someone who knows his polymorphous pleasures . To be praised by someone who appreciates wit and brains and who is willing to hang in there night after night repeating the whole litany . To be a poet . To tap-dance beautifully . In short , to be a goddess with an indeterminate number of arms dipping ravenously into life 's possibilities . <P> Reality is lamentably different , though one gets to feel that Diana is one hell of a tap-dancer .

" There are three fractured marriages in the past and four nearly forgotten children . <P> Diana 's current lover is an Armenian named Haig , and she is obsessed by him . Once on the beach , " he took a stick and drew a heart around the place where we made love . " Now that is the kind of flourish Diana adores , but few short of Don Juan could keep up the pace . Throughout the book , Haig is at bay , like an aging opera star pressured into too many roles . <P> After turning the last page , one feels that there are still more divorce papers and more lovers in Diana 's future , and that she will never scale down her demands . Her story is told in rather slapdash fashion : the children , for instance , seem like shadowy refugees from an earlier draft . The tone shifts too suddenly and too often-from comedy to com- plaint to rather fancy lyricism . Nonetheless , the author , a poet with four volumes of graceful , glib verse to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funnier than she perhaps intended . Diana is a girl with the courage of her own selfishness . A girl right out there doing her buck and wing . <P> - Martha Duffy
