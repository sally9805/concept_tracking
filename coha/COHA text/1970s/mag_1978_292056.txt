After Canada 's House of Commons installed television cameras and started recording its proceedings for the tube last fall , the tailors and barbers of Ottawa found themselves with an unexpected rush of parliamentary business . Members bought pastel-colored suits to brighten their images on the air . They had their hair styled . Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau reverted to the Caesar cut that he wore in his triumphant 1968 campaign . <P> Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has decided to admit TV cameras to witness its daily business , House leaders fear that something more fundamental than personal fashions may be disrupted by the intrusion . They believe that the onlooking electronic eye , with its unpredictable and even mysterious refractions of reality , might be an alien influence , a distraction that could profoundly change the nature of the House-its procedures , its schedules , its public image , even the quality of the legislation it produces . <P> The House is less of a gentlemen 's club than the Senate . It is more like , say , a parliamentary version of Stillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own internal rhythms and intricate habits of doing business . Most of its work , for example , is accomplished in committee , not on the House floor . A visitor to the gallery is usually startled to find two-thirds of the seats empty ; a transcendent tedium often reigns . As half a dozen members attend to the debate at hand , others read , amble , joke or even doze . It is not beyond the frontiers of possibility that a member might show up drunk , or threaten to punch another member . Into such an atmosphere , TV cameras would arrive like censorious missionaries landing on a pagan island . <P> The prospect makes the House very nervous . The question now is : Who shall control the cameras ? Speaker Tip O'Neill , along with the seven-member subcommittee that studied the matter for the House , is adamant that the House should keep the cameras under its own supervision . Television , O'Neill and many other members sense , is too potent a presence to be allowed to graze freely amid such lush Americana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament which also televises and the Speaker of the Canadian Parliament , " says O'Neill . " They both told me : ' Do n't let it out of your own control . ' " <P> O'Neill and the House Rules Committee basically want to follow the Canadian example , with fixed cameras focusing on the three spots from which members officially speak during business : the Speaker 's rostrum and the majority and minority tables . There would also be several movable cameras to provide different angles , but some fear that the whole system , if run by Government employees , would blinker off the surrounding atmospherics . The cameras would , in fact , provide a kind of visual Congressional Record-except of course that members would not be permitted to edit their remarks , as they often do now before the Record is printed . The TV tapes , or a live cable feed , would be made available to the commercial and public broadcast networks to edit and broadcast as they wished .               @ @ @ @ @ @
