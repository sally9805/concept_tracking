txt Suspected South Korean agent Tongsun Park and his fellow countrymen cultivated a network of lawmakers in the House of Representatives encompassing the leadership of both parties , committee chairmen , and rank-and-file members of the committees most important to him and the Seoul government . The breadth and pinpoint targeting of the web spun by social functions , private approaches , gifts , and political contributions is revealed in interviews by this newspaper with all reachable congressmen ( or their assistants ) whose names appear on a list of 58 current representatives labeled by a Park aide as lawmakers with whom Mr Park " has been associating . " The list , evidently prepared two years ago . is now in the hands of congressional investigators . The Monitor has obtained a copy . Of the 58 incumbent congressmen on the list ( several of whom could not be reached ) , 42 concede some form of contact in recent years with Mr. Park , his associates , or other South Koreans And these 42 representatives , roughly one-tenth of the chamber , include an impressive chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Five of the seven-member Democratic leadership ( Speaker , chief whip , two deputy whips , caucus chairman ) and two of the three top Republican leaders ( minority leader and conference chairman ) ? Seven committee chairmen . 17 subcommittee chairmen , and two ranking minority ( Republican ) committee members . ? Nine members of the Appropriations Committee , seven members of International Relations , four members of Agriculture , three members each of Armed Services and Rules , and two members of the Ethics // From page 1 U.S. congressmen on Korean list Committee now investigating South Korean influence in the House . This newspaper 's examination of the Park congressional list suggests that South Korean courting of lawmakers has been both broader and deeper in the House than the Senate . Only 10 of 27 current senators on a similar list concede any sort of contact with Mr. Park or other South Korean representatives , and all deny accepting money , gifts , or favors . Six congressmen on the Park list have acknowledged receiving a combined total of $10,950 in political contributions from the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D ) of Indiana reports $5,150 in the past three campaigns ; former majority whip John J. McFall ( D ) of California , $4,000 ; Eligio de la Garza ( D ) of Texas , Democratic caucus chairman Thomas S. Foley ( D ) of Washington , and Melvin Price ( D ) of Illinois , $500 each ; Morris K. Udall ( D ) of Arizona , $300 . Four other present and former lawmakers also are reported to have accepted cash donations from Mr. Park . Fourteen of the congressmen report being offered , and occasionally accepting noncash gifts and favors from South Koreans . Five have received honorary degrees from Korean universities , while three have taken privately financed trips to Korea . There has been some irony , however . Rep. Lester L. Wolff ( D ) of New York , a long-time critic of the South Korean regime , received his degree with an acceptance speech chiding the Seoul government . Other South Korean gifts included vases to two lawmakers , a topaz brooch ( returned by Rep. Phillip Burton D of California ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bauman R of Maryland ) , a suit ( to Rep. W. R. Poage D of Texas ) , and a plaque , silver-plated spoon , commemorative stamps , and other mementos ( to Rep. G. V. Sonny Montgomery D of Mississippi ) . In the House 33 members ( and , in one case , the wife of a member ) said they attended one or more parties , receptions , or dinners hosted by Mr. Park or Suzi Park Thomson , another alleged Korean agent and former clerk for retired speaker Carl Albert . Many of the functions took place at the two Washington clubs managed by Mr. Park . Most often mentioned are two large birthday celebrations organized by Mr. Park in 1973 and 1974 for Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill Jr . ( D ) of Massachusetts , then majority leader and now speaker . Some who went to such functions suggest an element of obligation to attend . Rep. James H Mann ( D ) of South Caroline refers to the " duty " of making himself " available as an interested and concerned public servant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to things . " Three other representatives on the list say they met Mr. Park on other occasions . Several congressmen 's contacts with the South Koreans , while perhaps sufficient to land them on the Park list , have been fleeting . Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( D ) of New York , for example , made a token appearance at a Park reception . " I stepped in and stepped out , " he recalls , not even bothering to shake Mr. Park 's hand . " I never would know the guy , " he says , " except for his picture in the paper . " Congressman Bauman attributes his inclusion on what he calls " the garbage list " to having attended Georgetown University 's foreign-service school 20 years ago with Mr. Park . " I have n't seen him , " he says , " since graduation. "
