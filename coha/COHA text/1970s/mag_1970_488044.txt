Walter Scott is not much read today , nor would I hazard anything on a Scott revival . Ivanhoe survived for years as a boys ' book , but it too , I gather , was dropped long ago from high school reading lists . It might be useful , therefore , to begin with a summary of Scott 's life before discussing this new biography . Scott was born in Edinburgh , in 1771 . " Wattie , " as he was called , was a precocious child and " a sweet-tempered bairn , a darling with all about the house , " according to the testimony of a servant , and with suitable adjustment that testimonial he would seem to have deserved throughout his life as he was apparently an exceptionally endearing man . With his father 's encouragement he studied for the bar . It is an interesting reflection on the time ( and on ours ) that it was felt that " for the higher branch of legal service an acquaintance with almost every realm of science ( as it was then understood ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he achieved an assured income as one of the " Principal Clerks of the Court of Session , " which post entailed duties for six hours a day during the six months of the year when the court was sitting . When he was 19 and she only 15 years old , he met a young lady named Williamina Belsches , the only child of a wealthy family that ranked socially far above Walt  --  r 's . During three years his attachment to her grew into a passionate love which blinded him to her feelings for him , which were never more than a warm fondness , so that when she announced her engagement to another ; man he was devastated , felt jilted and betrayed . At a considerably more levelheaded 26 , Scott met a Frenchwoman ( she was a year older than he ) named Charlotte Carpenter . The passionate intensity of the Williamina episode Scott had firmly suppressed in his nature , but there was a sincere ( if " sensible " ) attachment between the couple , and their marriage took place in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy one . It is now sometimes forgotten that Scott first won celebrity and fortune as a poet . The Lay of the Last Minstrel , published when he was 35 , was a spectacular " bestseller " success , as were the succeeding Marmion , The Lady of the Lake , and others all but forgotten . He was the poet of his age . His metamorphosis into a novelist came about by chance . Scott was rummaging in an attic for some fishing tackle and came across an unfinished novel called Waverly which he had abandoned years before . It caught his fancy and he decided to finish it . He published it anonymously , and the Midas touch continued into his second literary career . Waverly was followed by novel after novel  --  all published anonymously . Their fame spread from the British Isles through Europe and to the backwoods of America . The great critical reviews endorsed popular taste and regarded Scott 's novels as synonymous with fiction . George IV capped it all with a knighthood . A glance into Scott 's daily life is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather fulsome lady but an acute observer : " How does Sir Walter find time to attend to all he did ? ? his building , " ' ( of his gimcrack castle , Abbotsford ) , " his trees , his garden and meadows , his hospitality to the guests of all ranks ? Prussian prince 's , Swiss barons , lords and ladies and gentlemen , artists , mechanics , antiquarians , authors ? who came heedlessly to his house ? .. . But there he was , walking with them , conversing , telling stories . Above all , WHEN has he time to write . . . . He says ' Oh I have plenty of time  --  people have always time enough if they use all they have . ' " Suddenly , everything changed . The financial collapse of 1825 brought Scott down in the general ruin . He avoided bankruptcy ( which would have been the easy way out ) by putting into a trust , to pay off his creditors , everything he owned : his estate , his copyrights , his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt were heroic. - In addition to the current novel , he usually had " a half dozen side jobs on hand . " His energy and output under failing , health are astonishing , and his courage  --  probably the most admired of the virtues  --  is indeed admirable . But it killed him . He suffered a series of apoplectic fits , combined with paralysis . His mind gave way , and he died at Abbotsford on September 21 , 1832 . Now for Mr. Johnson 's book , How does he expand his story through 1,279 text pages in two volumes ? He has a method powered by an inspiration . His method is " research " as that term is too often understood in the higher academic reaches , and is interchangeable with " scholarship . " His inspiration is a good old-fashioned ( and rather touching ) hero worship of his subject . " Of all the British men of letters in the nineteenth century , " he categorically affirms , Walter Scott " is the noblest and the wisest . For . those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inspiration and a heritage for all mankind . " Given that conviction at that emotional pitch , there is nothing concerning the man unworthy of attention . And there is almost nothing ( I shall note some exceptions ) that has escaped the attention of Mr. Johnson . There are 134 pages of notes ( in double columns ) , 12 pages of bibliography , and a staggering number of " acknowledgments " of assistance . Among the latter my favorite is : " The ' British Meteorological Office and the United States Naval Observatory also gave me useful information about the weather on the date of the dying Scott 's arrival in London on June 13 , 1832 . " Turning to the text at this point , we learn the nature of Mr. Johnson 's indebtedness : " The day was warm and clear , with a strong south wind , and the sun , was well above the horizon as they disembarked . " To what more extended use does Johnson put the fruits of his research ? In the Introduction to these volumes , he remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sets up a series of rather specious questions : e.g. , " Was he an unworldly poet living in a world of dream , deceived by dishonest publishers and bungling agents ? Was he an ambitious materialist goaded by visions of wealth and the hopes of founding a lordly dynasty ? .. . Was . . his life anything more than a melodrama of grandiose worldly triumph crashing down into disaster ? " And more suspicious for an alert reader : " Was Scott a victim of fate or did he provoke his own catastrophe ? " But even the most casual reader might assume that the author is proposing these questions with the intention of answering them in the book , that follows . Johnson has no such design . In fact , design , in two senses of the word , is what this book ? cries out for . I mean design in the sense of structure or organization , and design in the sense of purpose or thesis , and I hope to show that the deficiencies are re , lated . Design in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his research in chronological order ( interrupted by chapters of " Criticism " to catch up with Scott 's productions in the intervals ) . I shall give two instances in which this method serves the author badly , not to mention the reader . The details of Scott 's ? business transactions  --  contracts entered into , partnerships formed and dissolved , loans extended and contracted , and so forth and , so on , are scrupulously particularized in the narrative at the appropriate date , but all this over such a stretch of time that when the crash comes it would take a team of accountants skilled in bankruptcy cases to clear up the muddle , and the baffled reader knows only that a disaster has somehow crept up on him . Another instance of a different ' order : Scott was married in 1797 , on page 155 , Vol. 1 , to a vivacious , attractive , apparently normal ( albeit French ) young woman . I , for one , trust Johnson 's scrupuldus scholarship and believe that noth- , ing turned up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) until we come to page 814 , Vol. 2 , and twenty-six years later , when we are treated to another observation from the keen-eyed Miss Edgeworth : " Lady Scott is very civil and always crowned with large full-blown roses  --  and the oddest dressed out French large black-eyed brown-skinned and rouged figure I ever saw , her hands always in motion picking at some- imaginary pin in her sash , or touching herself here and there as if she was picking off hairs and getting out her broken French English sentences all the while making a prodigious number of faces with as much difficulty as if she had not landed from France above a week . " With no comment whatever from Johnson to soften our shock at this sudden apparition from Dickens in the domestic circle of Walter Scott . Indeed , comment of any kind ( except for regularly recurring spurts of adulation ) is conspicuously absent from Johnson 's narrative . Infatuation with his hero seems to have paralyzed his reflective powers . And his sense of proportion . An item is jotted down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its appropriate sequence . Now it is true that any life in its externals will be largely made up of the small change of ' existence , and this can have a certain appeal to human curiosity . But page after page of meals eaten , toasts exchanged , visits paid , guests entertained , walks taken , favors conferred , strangers encountered , presents presented , bets wagered  --  where does it end ? ? can have a numbing effect even , though they all feature Walter Scott . I referred in the preceding paragraph to Johnson 's reluctance ( or simply failure ) to comment , letting his facts speak for themselves , mute though they often be . I believe this is related to his weakness in design in the second sense of purpose or thesis . He gives as the subtitle of his book , " The Great Unknown . " That was the name popularly given at the time to the anonymous author of Scott 's novels . But Johnson extends it to refer to the man himself . He says in the Introduction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his character in controversy . " I should call that " The Great Evasion . " Any person is an unknown , great or small . Any human being is a mystery . That 's simply a truism . But a biography , apart from the inevitable chronicling of events , is presumably one man 's attempt to face the mystery , to speculate , to offer a pattern that will present a coherent account of a personality . Johnson chronicles the events , as I certainly grant , and he will occasionally point to the mystery . But pointing to it , he seems to feel , satisfactorily consigns it to the " unknown . " The most puzzling thing about Scott , to me at any rate , was his insistence on anonymity in publishing his novels . " Scott 's original motive for secrecy was that . . - his first novel was a doubtful venture ; he did not wish its possible failure to harm the reputation he had won- as a poet . " So far , so good . But after the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense of ) anonym ity for year after year and in ( novel after novel , while " enjoying the fun and freedom of his flimsy disguise . . . he would be able to avoid the tiresome importunity of admirers who wished to pursue him with praise . " Surely this is disingenuous in one who had , as a poet , become the most celebrated Scotchman of his day and accepted the importunity of admirers as well as the unprecedented financial rewards that went with it . ( In a piquant coincidence unrecorded by Johnson , Byron once remarked in conversation , " It is absurd his denying what everyone who knows him believes , his being the author of those admirable works , " while Scott noted in his journal : " Another of Byron 's peculiarities was his love of mystifying . " ) " Defenses for his secrecy Scott threw out at various times , " Johnson reports . " But as he well knew ' the ostensible reasons which we produce to ourselves are very different from those which really influence our conduct . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my humor . ' " Scott was content to let it rest there and so is his biographer , but as Johnson should well know , this real reason ? Scott 's humor  --  is the real mystery . One can not fairly call on him to solve the mystery , but one expects him to face up to something batty in all this , and to wonder what place it had in his hero 's character . At least one aspect of it should have struck him . With the insist ' ence of provincial minor gentility , Scott ever prided himself on being a " gentleman " ( which he was ) , but it did n't prevent ' him from putting others , friends as well as strangers , guests in his house , even the Prince Regent ( and that same personage as George IV ) in the constrained position of playing their part in this farce and " pursuing him with praise " by ingenious circumlocution . Then there is the specter of Scott 's first love , Williamina Belsches . Thirty-four years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - dead for seventeen years , he called on her mother in Edinburgh . " I fairly softened myself like an old fool with recalling old stories , till I was fit for nothing but shedding tears and repeated , verses the whole night . This is sad work . " So far Johnson . But in an excellent essay not mentioned by our author , Edwin Muir supplies the information that though Scott determined to banish Williamina from his thoughts she still haunted his " secret world , " and on the eve of any great misfortune she appeared to him in his dreams . Muir suggests that the disastrous outcome of the romance and Scott 's determination to put the lady 's memory behind him " contracted the scope of his imagination and made it impossible for him to describe love . " In this latter connection , Johnson has something to say which serves incidentally as an example of his excursions into literary criticism . " When the heroine exists mainly to fulfill the reader 's expectations of what Scott called ' wedding cake ' he himself was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a rather thinly realized figure . Such young women , however , are not untrue to nature . Most young girls , like most young men , have very little personality save to the fond gaze of their parents or their lovers ; they are no more than a kind of amorphous human protoplasm with few qualities beyond that very modest degree of nubility that may suffice to get them a mate " In this matter , " Scott draws from life itself . " This is a strangely complacent defense , " Most young girls " may appear that way to Edgar Johnson  --  even , at times , to you and me . But if they are not untrue to nature , they are untrue to art . " Amorphous human protoplasm " is not the production of the creative dramatic imagination . The famous opening of Anna Karenina : " All happy families are alike . Every unhappy family is unhappy after its own fashion , " is not a universal truth but an aesthetic one . The artist is concerned with conflict , with complications in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " They lived happily ever after " is a signal that the story is over . I should , like to quote here a wellknown observation of Walter Scott 's which is not without its bearing on this and is a tribute to the man 's perceptive intelligence . On reading " for the third time at least Miss Austen 's finely written novel , Pride and Prejudice , " he exclaims at her talent " for describing the involvements and feelings " of everyday life . " The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going , but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things interesting from the truth of sentiment and description is beyond me . " Several years ago I read with considerable profit and pleasure Johnson 's Charles Dickens : His Tragedy and Triumph . He rated Dickens markedly below Scott . I have n't looked at the book again to confirm my suspicion that this error in judgment served him well . It gave him a perspective on his subject and a sense of proporticin that prevented a biography from becoming @ @ @
