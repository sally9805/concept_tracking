txt The U.S. East Coast moved closer to becoming an energy producer as Texaco , Inc. , announced Aug. 14 that it had made the first discovery of natural gas 100 miles off Atlantic City ? in the Baltimore ' Canyon area . The discovery was termed " very encouraging- by Texaco , which also indicated it would take more drilling to determine if the well would be commercially worthwhile . The discovery also capped several months of speculation on Wall Street over whether or not Texaco had actually hit anything . Although Texaco refused to comment on whether or not the well could be commercially viable , one oil-industry source said it sounded as if it could be " prolific . " Texaco announced that the well had flowed at the rate of 7.5 million cubic feet per day from a 38-foot zone . below 14,000 feet . Texaco also indicated it would test over the next 20 days other possible zones for natural gas . A spokesman said the company had only found natural gas and that there were no oil discoveries . Although the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pointed out that additional drilling would be necessary to determine the actual size of the discovery , and to // From page 1 Natural gas bubbles up off Atlantic City determine if the well warranted building a production platform . Although the company paid $50 million for the right to explore for oil and gas on this section and another one , the actual cost of producing the oil could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars . A oil-petroleum expert said that this would probably mean a gross revenue of about $15 million ? a year from that well . He estimated that Texaco might have spent $38 million to $48 million on drilling and platform construction . And he said that the $15 million return would be considered " not bad , but not extraordinary . " Texaco 's gas find followed two " dry holes , " or unsuccessful wells , drilled by Conoco and Shell Oil . However , five other companies , including Exxon , Gulf , Mobil , Shell , and Houston Oil &; Minerals , are still drilling . An Exxon spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to drill to 17,000 feet . At Mobil , the company as of Aug. 9 wasat 11,000 feet and intends to drill to 16,000 feet . The discovery will not have any immediate impact on U.S. imports of either oil or liquefied natural gas . It takes years to turn a discovery of oil or gas into an actual producing well . Also , the companies would probably have to lay a pipeline from the well to a terminal near Atlantic City . However , it is generally agreed that the proximity of the Baltimore Canyon to the energy consuming Northeast will keep the cost of transporting the gas relatively low . The U.S. Interior Department estimates that there is 13.3 trillion cubic feet of gas off the Baltimore Canyon and 800 million barrels of oil . In 1976 , the U.S. produced and consumed 19.95 trillion cubic feet of gas . In recent years , large discoveries of gas off of Texas and Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexicc have reversed the declining reserves of natura gas .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
