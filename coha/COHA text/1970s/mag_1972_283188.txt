THE 1,610 agents of the Justice Department 's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs are the advance scouts and front-rank skirmishers in the U.S. 's war on narcotics . The BNDD agent 's business is basically intelligence ; he deals with small-time pushers and " mules " ( couriers ) , as well as international traffickers , in any number of situations and any number of languages . He must be , in short , the compleat narc . <P> Roughly 45% of the BNDD 'S agents are stationed abroad , in as many as 57 countries . They sometimes operate out of a U.S. Embassy or consulate but they have a passion for anonymity and independence . If they work with anyone , it is the local narcotics agents-especially in France . French narcs , says one U.S. agent , " work like we do . It 's all in the approach . They will stay on the job 24 hours a day for as many days as it takes to break a case . " <P> At any one time , an agent may be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. agents , with budgets that are the envy of their foreign counterparts , depend heavily on informants . Such sources , who have led the way to major busts , have been paid as much as $30,000-well over the average agent 's annual salary . The overseas agent is usually careful to pass his information over to local authorities , and let them make the bust . Abroad , agents must not only be resourceful undercover operators but also diplomats , especially in countries sensitive to U.S. meddling in internal affairs . <P> One such agent-diplomat is Nick Panella , 39 , a graduate of The Bronx , Manhattan 's Hunter College , and most of the world 's drug trade centers : New York , Rome , Istanbul , Marseille , Montreal and Paris . Dark and compact , Panella describes his appearance as " the stereotype of the Italian wise ass " -a distinct asset in the trade . " Up in East Harlem , " he says , " nobody 's going to introduce any bright-eyed , 6-ft . Ryan to anybody worth talking to in drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone who looks like me . " <P> Panella , who earns $25,000 a year , lives with his Italian-speaking wife Sylvia and their three children in a comfortable Parisian suburb . In his current role as deputy director of BNDD 'S key Region 17 , which includes Marseille , Panella 's wardrobe runs to sporty suits . When he operated as an agent , he added a big pinky diamond and , frequently , a cigar . " By the time you 're through with a case , " he says , " you sometimes think you 're a trafficker . You sure as hell look like one . " <P> The toughest place Panella has worked in was Turkey . Frequently he posed as a buyer and approached the wagon trains by which heavily armed Turkish opium farmers moved their wares at night . " I never made a case in the interior when there was n't shooting , " Panella says , " but nobody ever got hit . The confusion is unbelievable . You just close in when the time comes and grab as many farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
