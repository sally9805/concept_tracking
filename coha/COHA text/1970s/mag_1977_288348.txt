Early one morning last week , Philippine Brigadier General Teodulfo Bautista , accompanied by 34 of his men ( including five colonels ) , strode trustingly into the tiny marketplace of Patikul on Jolo Island , some 600 miles south of Manila . Bautista , 49 , had come to Patikul for peace talks with Osman Salleh , a local chieftain of the Moro National Liberation Front , which has been fighting a civil war in the southern islands for nearly five years . Salleh had hinted that his 150 men were ready to join the government 's side . As he greeted Bautista with a smile , a harsh voice shouted , " Dapal ! " ( Hit the dirt ) . Salleh dropped to the ground as some 150 M.N.L.F. troops stepped into the open and shot . Bautista and all but one of his men were killed instantly . <P> The massacre was a severe blow to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos ' hopes that a cease-fire signed with the Muslim rebels last December might continue , for the insurgents ' brazen self-confidence suggests that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-scale resumption of the government 's anti-insurgency campaign that at its peak , cost Philippine forces 75 dead and 300 wounded weekly .
