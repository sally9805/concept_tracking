THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN Directed by LARRY PEERCE Screenplay by DAVID SELTZER <P> The facts really seem too bad to be true . Nevertheless , a title at the beginning of The Other Side of the Mountain is there to dispel any doubts : " This is a true story . " <P> In 1954 , still in her teens , Jill Kinmont had won two important ski competitions and dreamed of qualifying for the 1956 Olympics . In 1955 she skied off the side of a mountain during the Snow Cup Race . She nearly died , and survival was hardly a mercy . Her neck was broken , her spinal cord damaged and her body paralyzed from the shoulders down . But Jill Kinmont ( fetchingly played here by Newcomer Marilyn Hassett ) vowed that she would recover as fully as possible . <P> The process of her rehabilitation which makes up most of this movie , eventually allowed her very limited movement and mobility in a wheelchair . Although Kinmont was retained as a technical adviser for this film , Larry Peerce ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great doses of moral uplift and sentiment . The Other Side of the Mountain is photographed in the blindingly bright colors of a souvenir postcard , but is even less useful . It is too heavy for mailing and far too light to take seriously . <P> Brave Struggle . All the familiar material of rehabilitation melodrama is here : doubtful doctors and blind determination ; parents trying to be brave , a fianc who has pledged true love wilting away from the full force of the tragedy , other patients being both cynical and supportive as Jill masters her wheelchair . Her struggle is abetted by another skier , a cordial eccentric called " Mad Dog " Dick Buek ( Beau Bridges ) who wants to marry her . She greets his initial proposal with one of those speeches about pity that seem to be required by films like this the way a western needs a Shootout . In the end , she changes her mind-but when he flies to join her , Buek dies in a crash . It is some indication of the hollowness of The Other Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out looking like the last desperate invention of a weary and rather mechanical scenarist . It has been said-probably too often - that life is a bad movie . By that standard , Larry Peerce here presents the real thing .
