txt This city awoke one morning in 1986 to learn it had the third most-polluted air in the United States . Now ? after a lot of hard work cleaning it up ? Chattanooga 's air is sweeter than it has been in perhaps 20 years . For years dust and cinders dirtied people 's eyes as they passed factories puffing yellow and black smoke . Automobiles were corroded from pollution fallout . Lookout Mountain , the city 's nearby popular tourist spot , was often obscured by a cloud of smoke . Then things began to happen . Government became concerned , and so did the Chamber of Commerce . Industry , prodded by a tough new law , cleaned its house . Just as important for Chattanooga , where 39 per ent of the people work in industrial jobs , major firms chose to clean up rather than pull out . The cost so far has been over $32 million  --  and the job still is n't finished . But the days of black smoke and pollution emergencies are apparently over for good , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while serious , were somewhat easier to attack than they would have been in some other cities . The primary polluters here were industries ? the city is the 10th most industrialized in the country in terms of its population ( 119,000 in 1970 ) . Most of the industrial pollution was particulates ? small particles of matter that floated down over the entire Chattanooga valley . If autos or complex chemical emissions had been the problem , solutions probably would have come much slower . Nevertheless , Chattanooga 's progress is dramatic evidence that many firms think they can clean up and still be competitive . North American Royalties , Inc. , Wheland Foundry has one of the biggest jobs . In the process of making about one-fourth of the nation 's brake drums , the firm was pouring 7,000 tons of iron oxides and other compounds into the air every year . The firm built two bag houses to collect dust at a cost of $1.85 million . The will filter out 99.5 percent of the dust , or 6,965 tony , which will go into landfill . U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadline , now will put 8.7 tons of pollutants into the air a year ? compared with 1,864 tons . Ross-Meehan Foundry will drop from 62 tons to 0.3 , and Crane from 3,239 to 69. // *Chattanooga // Northwest of the city , General Portland Cement has been sending 5,860 tons of dust soaring up the side of Signal Mountain , despite equipment which was already **35;956;TOOLONG firm , at a cost of $2.1 million , built electrostatic precipitators which now stop 99.8 percent of the dust from enterning the air . Smaller firms , from Billings Moving &; Storage Company to Willie 's Super Market , also have come into full compliance . While a number of companies resisted the new law for awhile , virtually all of them have bowed to the edict and , in turn , become boosters for clean air . Mayor Robert Kirk Walker happily points out that in spite of the pollution ordinance , industry has spent $15 million so far in 1972 for expansion and has added 946 new jobs . " It speaks well for industry already here and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive way , " the Mayor notes . So far only one firm , the Chattanooga Rendering Plant , has decided to pull up stakes . It will build a new , nonpolluting plant in Bessemer , Ala . Ammunition plant 's problem Another sort of problem is presented by the Volunteer army-ammunition plant , an old , federal installation which is a serious polluter when operating at full capacity , according to city officials . Dr. Marion D. Barnes , chairman of the Chattanooga and Hamilton County Air Pollution Control Board , says : " We are not quite cleans house ' sure who has the responsibility for seeing that the army plant does not pollute . We are asking a federal judge to give us a declaratory judgment to tell us whether Volunteer is under the jurisdiction of the local ordinance , - or immune to our controls . " Volunteer , meanwhile , continues to emit more pollutants than the local law permits . The plant is being rebuilt at a cost of $119 million , of which $16 million is for air-pollution devices , and it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut level What does all this mean to the people of Chattanooga ? The particulate level has dropped from 244 micrograms per cubic meter in 1969 to 98 micrograms at the latest count . With new devices now going into service , this should drop to about 75 . Under federal laws ? which are not as strict as Chattanooga 's ? the 75 level does not have to be met until 1975 . Further , Chattanooga 's particulate count should drop to 60 within another two years . Under federal standards , no date has yet been set for the 60-particulate level . With cleaner air , Mayor Walker says he expects a " tremendous growth . . . in tourism . " And he is hopeful that additional industry will be attracted because , even though standards are tough , industry will have the advantage of going into a community that has stabilized its approach to the Pollution problem .
