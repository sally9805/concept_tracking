One urgent need these days at the deficit-ridden Metropolitan Opera is to find ways to stage new productions as cheaply as possible , but still well . The company 's mounting of Francis Poulenc 's Dialogues of the Carmelites was the best response yet to that challenge . Instead of the average cost of $200,000 to $300,000 , not to mention the $800,000 lavished on Franco Zeffirelli 's Otello in 1972 , Dialogues came in at $75,000 - about $3,000 under budget . Stage Director John Dexter managed that feat by " cannibalizing " costumes and props from other Met productions-nuns ' habits from Suor Angelica , raised flooring from Boris Godunov . One would never guess those origins . Dialogues looks fresh and innovative . <P> The new Dialogues must rank with the 1973 Les Troyens and 1974 Boris among recent Met triumphs . Its arrival finally corrects one of the major omissions of the Rudolf Bing era . Poulenc , the onetime dandy of French music who developed in his later years into a composer of surprising depth , completed Dialogues in 1956 . Rarely has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's La Scala gave the premiere in January 1957 . Before the year was out , it had been done by the Paris Opera , San Francisco Opera and the old NBC Opera Company . Yet Dialogues never quite received the critical success it deserved-largely because its conservative , tonal harmonic scheme was anathema to the academies and other contemporary-music coteries . Today , fortunately , much of the snobbism has gone out of modern music . Dialogues should now become ever more popular - or as popular as any opera with a nonromantic theme can be . <P> Dialogues depicts the plight of a tiny order of nuns during the French Revolution . A highly strung aristocrat , Blanche de la Force , joins their number , then flees the convent rather than fulfill a vow of martyrdom . She rejoins the nuns at the guillotine , however , as they are executed for illegal assembly . <P> Not your average opera plot . Poulenc resisted the use of arias and other standard set pieces . Instead , with deep expressiveness , he used a declamatory vocal style not unlike that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pellas-like sequence of tableaux that is heavy on interior meaning and short on melodramatic display . <P> White Cross . The Met production takes the subject every bit as seriously . <P> The action is carried out on a raked stage formed into the shape of a huge white cross . Onto it are dropped occasional figurative pieces of scenery - a one-dimensional wall here , a spidery church column there . The symbolism is obvious , but as unit sets go , this one is no less effective than the nave of the average cruciform church , or for that matter the raked ring at Bayreuth in the 1950s.
