Talk about unpopularity . Rhodesia proclaimed itself a republic two weeks ago , severing its last tenuous links with Britain . Yet by the end of last week not a single country had accorded diplomatic recognition to the newborn . Worse yet , one nation after another began closing its consulate in Salisbury , the capital . <P> Norway and Denmark were the first to pull out . A few days later , the U.S. declared that it still considered Britain the " lawful sovereign " in Rhodesia , and followed suit . Washington 's undisguised snub precipitated a wholesale departure . Italy , The Netherlands , France , Belgium , Austria and West Germany shut down ; Switzerland wavered . Only South Africa and Portugal-both of which back Smith 's regime-and Greece , which has an honorary consul there , were sure to remain . <P> African Pressure . The U.S. decision to end diplomatic relations was prompted by Secretary of State William Rogers ' recent African tour . During the trip , the leaders of at least six Black African nations objected to continued U.S. relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over roughly 5,000,000 blacks . Britain , which withdrew its diplomatic representation last year , had also urged the U.S. to pull out , and a United Nations Security Council resolution , passed in 1965 , called for diplomatic isolation of Rhodesia . <P> For Ian Smith , the U.S. move was a major diplomatic defeat . Many Rhodesians had hoped that more , not less recognition would follow the republic 's official birth . Despite the shock of nonrecognition , however , Rhodesia probably will not be seriously harmed . The country 's economy is prospering despite four years of U.N . sanctions . Tobacco production has dropped by two-thirds since 1966 , when Smith overrode British demands for greater black representation and declared Rhodesia an independent member of the Commonwealth . But nickel , chrome and other exports are finding their way to world markets via neighboring South Africa and the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola . Salisbury 's shops are full of imported goods , and the capital is even experiencing a mild building boom .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
