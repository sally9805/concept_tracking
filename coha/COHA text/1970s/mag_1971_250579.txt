When not dreaming of the Big Strike , bass fishermen are forever trying to hook their friends on Micropterus sal-moides , the wily and voracious largemouth bass . Such was the case when Correspondent Sam Iker , a self-certified " bass nut , " lured Associate Editor Ray Kennedy to Dunnellon , Fla .. for a long weekend of fishing on the Withlacoochee River . Kennedy 's report : <P> The shoebox under my arm contained a tangled reel , a 25 red-and-white bobber and a dozen rusty hooks - the remnants of a summer of bluegill fishing with the children . Anglin ' Sam came armed for an amphibious invasion . As he checked out his gear with John Wilhelm Sr. , one of Florida 's foremost bass fishermen , Sam unpacked armfuls of monogrammed rods and gleaming reels , a stack of Bassmaster magazines and a tackle box as big as a footlocker . Unfolding like a Chinese puzzle , the box was crammed with all kinds of hardware , first-aid supplies , rod cement , hooks , hook sharpener , pork rinds , floaters , stringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver spoons , plastic worms , rubber frogs and fake snakes . " You forgot your harpoon , " said John . <P> What is so special about the largemouth bass ? I asked . " They 'll battle you all the way into the boat and then bite your leg , " said John . " They 'll hit anything that moves , " said Anglin ' Sam . " They 'll gulp down crawfish , rice birds , ducklings , water moccasins-anything , " said John . " They 're the smartest , most unpredictable and most sought-after fish in the world , " said Anglin ' Sam . " And they taste good , " said John . <P> When I asked for a few tips , John offered to show me the proper way of baiting up on the river . He cupped a lure in his hands and turned his back . I said I could n't see what he was doing . " Exactly ! " he exclaimed . " Neither can the bass . You let one of those Withlacoochee monsters see your bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put of your hands . " <P> Local Monster . No one in Dunnellon , a lazy , little ( pop . 1,146 ) inland town near Ocala , is above the Chamber of Commerce come-on . The town bills itself as the " Home of the World 's Largest Bass , " and everywhere from the Dinner Bell Restaurant to Bass Galore Village ( " Fishing Headquarters , U.S.A. " ) are mounted specimens to prove it . Up at Joe L. Cobb Inc. , Realtors , Joe has a photograph on the wall memorializing the morning he and a friend boated 18 bass totaling 124 Ibs. in " 2 wild and wonderful hours . " Down at Bucky 's Sports Center , the natives tell of the local version of the Loch Ness monster , a wicked old mossback called " Ol ' Geronimo , " who " goes 30 Ibs. if he 's an ounce . " * Next door at the Belair Resort , Proprietor W.C. Jefferson laments the passing of Charlie , an 8-lb. pet bass that would nose up to the motel 's dock for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recently pulled a 16 pounder out of a " special hole " in the river , Sam 's eyes pinwheeled . " Where 's the hole ? " he demanded . " Where ? " The native just smiled .
