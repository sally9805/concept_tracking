txt THE MAN ON the phone was In the grip of hysteria . He was a psychiatrist in trouble . " It 's unbelievable what they 're trying to do . It 's incredible , " said Dr. Jordan Scher . His voice was full of angst , I think they call it . Scher operates a drug clinic called the Methadone Maintenance Institute at 571 W. Jackson Blvd. , and he Is suffering from a deeply-rooted fear that the City of Chicago is trying to put him out of business . This does not appear to be the case , but fear is a powerful emotion . Haunting him is a zoning amendment , proposed a few weeks ago by Mayor Bilandic 's office that deals with the location and operation of " outpatient drug abuse treatment centers , ' of which there are 21 in Chicago . Close-up With Jeff Lyon THE AMENDMENT says such drug clinics must . be in areas with C-2 zoning . The most common feature of the C-2 landscape is the used car lot . This has Scher thinking he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place that 's hard to find and tough to beat . " The amendment would also require a special use permit . To get one , you have to tell neighboring property owners that you are opening a methadone clinic and invite them to express their views at a zoning hearing . Scher thinks this is inviting disaster , since most people would welcome a parrot jungle to their neighborhood before they 'd accept drug . addicts . Now , Scher is called a flamboyant man , and he has had what they call a roller-coaster career . He 's known the highs of national prominence as an authority on the human mind . He has also known the lows of going to jail as an income-tax evader . Not long ago he was threatened with loss of his medical license . His methadone clinic has often come under tire as a place where drugs are too freely dispensed . All of this has created in him an // drug-clinic ' zoning amendment could hurt those who need it Cchttinued from page one anxiety syndrome . Mid anxiety has impelled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Thursday when the City Council Building and Zoning Committee holds a public hearing on the proposed amendment . IT OUGHT TO be a good show , pitting one charming smoothie , Scher , against another charming smoothie , Ald. Edward Vrdolyak , chairman of the committee . Scher has also been at work in the media . There was a piece in The Tribune Wednesday by Edward Bunker , author of the book , " Straight Time , " from which the . Dustin Hoffman movie came . Bunker is a patient at Scher 's clinic . Bunker implies ' that passage of the amendment means death for Chicago 's ' drug clinics and that hordes of addicts , now living normal lives on methadone , will be flung back on the streets , where they will return to street . crime and $100 , a-clay heroin habits . I spoke Wednesday to Scher , his wife , Lynda , and his laer , ' Lou Schlifkin . Tho hysteria ran high.wy " WE 'RE GOING to have to move . We ca n't riven be next to a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry , " Lynda Scher told me. - " And once we move Into here commercial areas , we have to go around and get the permis sion - " of - all the property owners surrounding us before we can open . It 's going to be impossible . " " Are you Sure you 're going to have to move ? " she was asked . " Is n't there . something called a grandfather clause ? " " There 's no provision to grandfather those clinics , " she said . was-told the same thing by Schlifkin and Scher . The only trouble with all of this is that it is n't true . A SPOKESMAN for 011andie told me Tuesday night that all existing drug clinics in the city ere protected by the grandfather Muse , which stipulates that they can not bo made to move by any new zoning amendment  --  they will have ' to relocate in a C-2 zoned area only if they sell , lose their lease , or wish to expand their facilities . New clinics , however , will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held before they can get special-use permits . But they will not need written permission from each of their neighbors before they can open , es t1e Schers believed . ? Scher 's hysteria . is unwarranted . The 7,000 methadone patients in the city will not be thrown back on the streets to rob us and sit in the . gutter nodding off . So everything is fine , right ? ? Wrong . The zoning amendment is still a bad one . " IT MAKES NO attempt ' to balance the need to maintain the integrity of neighborhoods with the need to help drug addicts , " according to Thomas Kirkpatrick Jr. , executive director of . the Illinois Dangerous Drugs Commission , which oversees the city 's drug clinics . " IL 's much too restrictive , " he said . . For one thing , lie pointed out , most ' clinics rent . Landlords , realizing the clinics have nowhere to go but to an undesirable C-2 zoned area , might very well start jacking up the rents . That may force the clinics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be next to useless . There are relatively few areas zoned C-2 in Chicago , and they are in outlying areas , and often difficult to get to . Methadone patients have to visit their clinics seven days a week at the outset of treatment . The object of their treatment , meanwhile , is to enable them to get employment . To expect them to keep a job while traveling all over the city every day to obtain their methadone Is dpecting too much . THERE IS NO doubt the city must tackle the issue of drug-clinic location , just as it must tackle the issue of halfway houses and work-release centers . Rightly or wrongly , people in residential neighborhoods do n't want these facilities , and the city must obey its residents up to a point . But exiling drug clinics to places inaccessible to clients is n't the answer . Methadone is no perfect solution to drug addiction , but it is doing some demonstrable good . People in a proper methadone program do n't suffer the ravages of heroin . They can earn a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their habit . At the better clinics , they get counseling which often leads to detoxification and total withdrawal . Dr. Edward Sonny , who formerly headed the state drug abuse program and who now runs Substance Abuse Services , a drug clinic at 1439 S. Michigan Av. , estimates that about a third of all methadone patients achieve very good results and resume productive lives . If there are 7,000 methadone patients in Chicago , that means more than 2,300 of them might fight their way out of a drug nightmThe city should tread lightly as it considers relocating these clinics.
