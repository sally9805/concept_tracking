txt William C. Chamberlain is marketing manager for Greerco Inc .. a maker of processing machinery with revenue of S6 million a year . Last July 5 in his office at Greerco 's prefabricated headquarters building by the foothills of the White Mountains . he received a surprising phone call . The voice on the other end claimed to be a representative of the People 's Republic of China . The caller was summoning Mr. Chamberlain to Peking as soon as possible to make a deal . Thirteen weeks later , Mr. Chamberlain and Greerco 's president . Walter Salter . neither of whom had ever attempted to do business in alma , had visited Peking and returned . Their souvenir : a S6.8 million order for arcane equipment known as wax molders . The order will add 20% to fiscal 1979 sales and 25% to fiscal 19130 sales . Softening Attitude Without realizing it , little Greerco was a beneficiary of China 's softening attitude of recent months that eventually led to the establislung of formal diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China . Oil refineries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the paraffin refined from China 's waxy crude oil . The machines control the temperature of the wax and mold it into 11-pound blocks of paraffin for use in other industries . In the course of their journey . Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain got a first-hand look at the polite , formal and dogged Chinese negotiating style that a growing number of U.S. companies are likely to encounter in coming months . Greerco 's success also points up a little-realized fact of the blooming China trade : While big companies ' efforts to crack the China market have received a lot of the publicity . many smaller companies have received a big chunk of that business . " I think the majority of companies that have been selling over in China the past couple of years are n't on the Fortune list of 500 companies  --  or they 're on the second half of it , " says Paul Speltz , vice president of Asian operations for WJS Inc. , a Washington-based East-West trade-consulting firm . " On certain machinery , small companies can be more competitive than big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more . " Mr. Speltz says . Quiet Competition " Small companies are keeping ( their business in China ) quiet to keep their competition from running in behind them . There 's a lot of business going on in China that is n't getting publicity . " Mr. Speltz says . In 1978 more than 80 U.S. companies will have gone to China on invitations for " technical exchanges . " which can evolve into negotiations and contracts . says William W. Clarke . director of People 's Republic of China affairs at the Department of Commerce 's Bureau of East-West Trade in Washington . " The main way of doing business with China is to get invited . That 's if you 're an exporter . If you 're an importer , then you just go to the ( semiannual ) Canton Fair . which is easier , " he says . In the first 10 months of this year . U.S. exports to the mainland rose to $529 million . from $95.8 million in the first 10 months of 1977 , Mr. Clarke says . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China may reach $900 million , up from $171-5 million last year . He also says he expects next year 's exports to surge to $1.2 billion . For Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain . the Oriental odyssey was exhilarating but not easy . In preparing for their trip , they worked with WJS , which made the original contact on China 's behalf . then helped to set up the negotiations . " They ( WJS people ) were our mouthpiece . " Mr. Chamberlain says . View of the City Once in the People 's Republic . Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain checked into the Peking Hotel . From the balconies of their twinbed rooms in the hotel 's new wing , built about six years ago , the view was of Peking 's main boulevard . Chang An . lined with trees and broad sidewalks . A " very plain room " with " plain painted walls . " it cost 50 Chinese yuan , the equivalent of $30 , a night . Their workday began with breakfast at 7 a.m. , with " Western food  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Chamberlain confined his breakfast diet to " dry toast and yogurt because the first few nights I was there I had a lot of hot , spicy Chinese food  --  my stomach was giving me hell . " On morning walks on the main road , they watched Chinese doing calisthenics along the roadside . A daily exercise for Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain was getting a cab outside their hotel . " Transportation was a problem , " Mr. Chamberlain says , explaining that Peking has only 350 Toyota taxis . " Sometimes we had a 45-minute wait for a cab , " he adds . After hailing a taxi , it was only a 20-minute ride to the meetings through the dusty city streets . " It was a dusty environment  --  we were both coughing . They do n't gruw any grass over there , " Mr. Chamberlain says . " Everything is dirt-or cement " This overstates the case , but central Peking is short of green spaces , and in the fall , the dry wind blows in from the desert . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties in their hotel rooms . They were told the Chinese . who all wear baggy brown or grey trousers and Mao pickets , would feel more at ease around the Americans if they left their more formal business suits behind . And besides , casual dress was more suited to the Chinese fall climate , with temperatures in the 70-to-8Odegree range . At the Peking technical building . talks with the Chinese were held around a long , felt-covered conference table in a smokefilled room . Through interpreters . Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain spent the first 4'e days of their visit in " technical discussions " with up to 20 Chinese technicians . To the Americans . these " discussions " seemed rather one-sided . " They were more reserved on giving information . " Mr. Salter says . Mr. Chamberlain adds . " You do all the talking , they do all the listening . " Concessions to Foreigners Jerome A. Cohen , director of Harvard University 's East Asian legal studies , says , " We do know that China has used trade negotiations as a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adds that that practice may have ended along with other practices that pioneer Western businessmen in China encountered a few years ago . " In the middle of negotiations , it was n't at all unusual for Chinese to stop and read quotations from the Red Book , and ( foreign ) businessmen would have to read along , " Mr. Cohen says . Also gone from Chinese negotiating sessions are breaks for calisthenics , he says . " The Chinese are practical . They 're willing to overlook some things to get what they want , " he says . Changes in attitudes also emerged in an evening 's entertainment in the capital city ? " American Night " at the theatre . A 3 ' 4-hour presentation of Chinese ballet and folklore was no surprise to the Greerco officials . " But then one of the actresses sang ' Shenandoah , ' and ' America the Beautiful ' in English . ' America the Beautiful ' had n't been sung there in 29 years , " Mr. Salter says . Back at the negotiations , the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese . The Americans were ready to talk dollars and cents , but the Chinese just kept asking more questions . " They held the commercial negotiations off to the end , " Mr. Chamberlain says . Mr. Salter adds . " We were getting quite frustrated . to be honest . " More Waiting Their anxiety to get down to dollars was building because , two weeks into their talks , the Chinese still had n't disclosed how many wax molders they wanted to order , what size and capacity , and at what price . " I wanted to just say , ' For crying out loud , could you just tell us how many machines you want ? ' " Mr. Chamberlain says . " Finally , they asked us to come back with a ( price ) quotation for 10 machines , " Mr. Chamberlain recalls . The quantity stunned the Americans into disbelief . The U.S. was the only country in the world with 10 wax molders , and those were purchased over a 30-year period . " We were cautious . We thought they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold us to the ( unit ) price for fewer units , " ? Mr. Chamberlain says . The Americans quoted a price for 10 machines , but the Chinese would n't accept it . " They said that our price was too high , and that we should return to our hotel and ' make a serious effort at lowering the price in the spirit of friendship . ' " Mr. Chamberlain says . " They asked if we could n't reconsider a price discount for the opportunity to do business in China , " Mr. Salter adds . Then , a major turn in the negotiations took place . " We had lowered our prices about as low as we could go , " Mr. Chamberlain says , so the Americans called an airline to arrange for a flight home . " That move expedited the matter , " Mr. Salter recalls . After discovering the Americans ' intention to leave , the Chinese said they were n't through with the negotiations . Messrs . Salter and Chamberlain went back to the negotiating table with their final offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Chinese accepted it , in the same " polite and formal " manner in which they stalled earlier .  - -  /teg- d wanted us to leave China on a friendly basis . no ? natter what transpired there . " Salter says . Indeed , the Chinese honored the two with a banquet . Interspersed throughout the eight-course meal were toasts between the Commiuusts and the capitalists . ' 1301117 pleasant it is to have you here in China and negotiating business , " one of the Chmese would say in a toast . Then it was " Earn Pm " or bottoms up , followed by another swallow of 140-proof Mao Tai . Then Mr. Salter or Mr. Chamber/am would stand up and make a toast . followed by another toast by one of the Chmese. maybe " thaninng us for our technical presentation . " and so it went , turning the meal into a staggering event for the Americans The speed of the transaction even impressed Mr. Speltz of WJS. the Chma-Tradeconsulting firm . He says a second visit to the mainland is usually necessary to seal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're taking 11 stride , " Mr. Salter says of his company 's new-found fortune in the Far East .
