The Limp Lip <P> Sir / At last , after decades of a reputation for head cracking and bone crushing , we are no longer looking for a fight . Hardhats are looking for a leader . From a labor point of view , Nixon and McGovern clearly do not qualify . <P> I not only admire George Meany Sept. 11 as an able , though aged labor leader ; this time I even agree with him . As your article indicates , most hardhats do think for themselves , and many may just sit out ' 72 . <P> Who knows ? This may well be the election year that local politicos get the lever , but presidential candidates wind up with the limp lip . It just might happen . <P> P.J. MCGRATH <P> Member , Local # 1 <P> I.U.E.C. <P> New Windsor , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir / As a first-time voter , a blue-collar worker and as an American , I intend to take President Nixon 's advice and make my first vote one of my best ever . I will vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> MICHAEL STEINBACH <P> McPherson , Kans . <P> <P> Promotional Raises <P> Sir / In reading your story on the presidential campaign Sept. 18 , I noted your quoting Senator McGovern as saying that the president of Dow received a pay raise of 196% and has to " eke out an existence on $305,000 a year . " <P> Senator McGovern referred to a raise in pay C.B. Branch obtained when he became president of Dow after having served as executive vice president for nine years . <P> Substantial promotional raises are not unusual in various fields of endeavor . For example , if a Senator is elected President , his pay is raised from $42,500 to $200,000 , a 370% increase . <P> MARK BATTERSON <P> Director <P> Public &; Community Relations <P> The Dow Chemical Co . <P> Midland , Mich . <P> <P> Tom Dowd 's Good Buck <P> Sir / I wish to express my great delight in reading about Construction Worker Tom Dowd 's " good buck " - $94,000 a year Sept. 181 . Here is a story of a doer , a worker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need be . Never mind the comments like sky-high paychecks , outrageous , grossly inflated , needless expense , etc. , etc . <P> Usually such rewards go to the soft-handed-like stock market jobbers , suave promoters of semi-useless gadgets-or to some superjock adept at little boys ' games . So when a worker can achieve semimillion-aire status by his skill and sweat , I say cheers . <P> As one who has labored many a day in the hot sun for $2 an hour ( and glad to get it ) , this account of Mr. Dowd 's success is just great . May his tribe increase . <P> FRANK BUCKLER <P> Walla Walla , Wash . <P> <P> Tough Luck <P> Sir / The strandees at London 's Gatwick Airport Sept. 18 learned what seasoned travelers have long known-in any kind of emergency , one can expect more help from a casual stranger in the street than from the U.S. embassy . If your money has been stolen , you may be lent enough to cable home for more . If it takes a couple of days for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ! If you have no one to cable to , tougher still . <P> Embassy reform is badly needed . Instead of being made to feel we are somehow offside to apply for help when we have nowhere else to turn , we should be welcomed and given ungrudging assistance . <P> KATHARINE WILLIAMSON <P> Jamesport , N.Y . <P>
