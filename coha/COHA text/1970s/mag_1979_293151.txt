Accused Murderer Ted Bundy goes on trial in Miami <P> " Do you see the man ? " the prosecutor asked last week in a Miami courtroom . On the witness stand , the pretty blond woman swiveled in her chair and pointed a quivering finger at a slender , dark-haired man . " Would you identify him for the record ? " continued the prosecutor . The silence that followed was suddenly broken by the suspect , who is leading his own defense . " That 's Mr. Bundy , " he said , referring to himself in the third person . " Thank you , Mr. Bundy , " said the judge . Replied the defendant : " You 're welcome . " <P> So went the testimony in the bizarre murder trial of Theodore Robert Bundy , 32 , on charges that in January 1978 he bludgeoned to death two Chi Omega sorority sisters at Florida State University in Tallahassee and seriously injured three other coeds . The defendant is an unlikely looking murder suspect . He is handsome , articulate and composed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost indistinguishable from the defense lawyers clustered around him . Nonetheless , Bundy is suspected by police of being one of the worst mass murderers in U.S. history , responsible for a trail of up to 36 young women victims , spanning four years and four states . As a final outlandish touch , his sensational murder trial is being televised live , under a recent Florida high court decision . It was not affected by last week 's Supreme Court ruling that pretrial hearings need not be public ( see LAW ) . <P> Perhaps the strangest element in the Bundy case is his own seemingly contradictory character and background . He was raised in Tacoma , Wash. , where he was a Boy Scout , and in 1972 was graduated with honors from the University of Washington . Professors praised him as a " mature young man who is very responsible and emotionally stable . " He became a member of Governor Daniel Evans ' re-election campaign staff and later worked for the Seattle Crime Commission . Former colleagues recall Bundy as intelligent and likable . <P> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound , young women who superficially resembled one another ( long brown or blond hair , parted in the middle ) began to disappear . Only the skeletons of some were found . Police had one small bit of evidence to go on : a young man named Ted , who drove a Volkswagen " Beetle , " often showed up shortly before the women vanished . <P> Bundy owned a Volkswagen , and he took it with him when he transferred in 1974 to the University of Utah law school . The Washington killings stopped , and a similar series soon began in Utah . But the police had little to connect Bundy with any of them until the summer of 1975 , when he was arrested and later charged with kidnaping Carol DaRonch , 17 , from a shopping center in the Salt Lake City area . Bundy was convicted and sentenced to one to 15 years in prison .
