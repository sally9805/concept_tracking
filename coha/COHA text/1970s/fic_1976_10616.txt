stomacher of emeralds that the Great Mogul himself might envy is entirely her own ( the word " body " is the subject of that last small verb : jewelled qualifying clauses now drip from my pen just as real jewels hung , fell , swayed , glittered not only from the tall stout erect figure of Mrs. Astor but from all the other ladies present ) . Fifty ladies and gentlemen had been invited for this particular dinner party , Ward McAllister whispered in my ear , breath more foul with the violets that he 'd been eating than the usual odour of port he wanted to disguise . " All New York that matters is under this roof tonight . " The Mystic Rose gave Emma a long look ; then the eyes went straight to the replicas of the D'Agrigente diamonds . I feared for a moment that Mrs. Astor would suddenly produce not a lorgnettebut a jeweller 's magnifying glass , detect Emma 's paste and order us to the door . But Emma passed with colours that flew before the wind of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade . " We 've heard so much about you , Princess . We 're so glad you could be with us tonight .

" Mrs. Astor allowed me to bow over her rather thick beringed fingers . " Mr. McAllister is confidentthat you and I are cousins . You see , I was born a Schermerhorn . " The tone of her voice was reverent , as if she had been born a Plantagenet . I deeply dislike McAllister 's doubling of my name . In his ambitionfor us socially , he has managed to impose upon me a false persona , for I am connected with neither the grand Schermerhornsnor the grand Schuylers . My Schermerhorn mother was born on a poor upstate farm , one of eleven undistinguished children , all of whom had the misfortune to live while my father Schuyler kept a tavern in Greenwich Village  --  in those days a real village and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I am willing to play whatever game is expected ; and was complaisant . " Yes , my mother was a Schermerhorn , too . Front Columbia County . " All perfectly true . " Their place was near Claverack . " Again perfectly honest . " Ours is indeed a large family . " Mrs. Astor gave me a gracious nod as if she were ( ) , ticen Victoria and I one of a thousand ( ; crp101man princely cousins to be suitably recognized . Then we passed into the next drawing room , where everything was blue-green damask and rich malachite . McAllister remained beside his Rose , introducing her to people she for the most part appeared to know better than he , but then that is the task of the chamberlain in a royal household . Emma caused some stir . Everyone knew of her . Several ladies had met her at one or another of Mrs. Mary Mason Jones 's lunch parties , so she was well provided for with respectable companionsof her own sex . The men eyed her most appreciatively  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razzle-dazzles . Proudly they bear the great names of the New York that so bore me . But I am a beggar ; may not choose . " You have not been polite ! " A woman 's voice behind me . I turned and there was Mrs. William Sanford , as bright and cheerfulas ever . " How have I failed you ? " " You would n't join us for lunch at the Brunswick  --  " " I was indisposed . No , really . Felled by Delmonico 's splendid food  --  " "  --  so the Princess said , but I thought you 'd really dropped us . " We kept on in this vein . I was startled : Emma had not told me that she had accepted the Sanfords ' invitation on the second day of my convalescence . I had been under the impression that she had retired , as usual , into Apgar-land . " We had a charming time . I hope she did . The Belmonts were there and they took to her enormously , but then everyone does . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's Eve . " I 've not met them , " I said to Emma when I saw the invitation . " But I have , " she said . " It 's all right . They are charming . He 's from our side of the Atlantic . " Belmont  --  " the beautiful mountain "  --  wasborn with that name , but in German . As a Jew he occupies a somewhat equivocal place in the New York scheme of things . He is , however , a great magnate , for he represents the Rothschilds in America and since he possesses what McAllister calls true " tong , " his palace and its entertainments almost rival those of the Mystic Rose . " But Caroline wo n't have the Belmonts here . So narrow , I think . " Mrs. Sanford was actually criticizing our hostess . I liked her more and more.  | " But then I suppose she wants to draw the line somewhere , " I said . " Yes . And what she 's done is to draw the outer perimeter so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fit comfortablyinto her dining room . " This was a most unexpected announcement . " Really , Mrs. Sanford , I think you are a revolutionary . " " You 'll be one , too , if you stay too long in this city , revolvingand revolving in the same orbit . Look at the gentlemen , will you ! " I said that I had already noticed them . " Half drunk already . They leave their offices , drop in at the Hoffman bar or at their club , have a drink or two , come home , drink some more , quarrel with their wives . Then  --  well , here they are , thinking of food and drink like buffaloes heading for the watering hole . " " Surely Mr. Sanford does not qualify as a  --  buffalo . " I detected something odd in her manner , a slight turning away ; the merriment ceased . " No , no . Bill is usually most abstemious . But he does love to go out , and I do n't . " " Even now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hothouse , Mr. Schuyler . " I was perfectly flattered , and responded in kind until dinner was announced . Ward McAllister , in loco Astoris , took in Emma first . I came in last with Mrs. Astor on my arm ( McAllister had earlier sent me full verbal instructions as to protocol via the stately butler ) . " Where is Mr. Astor ? " I asked as the majestic figure beside me set the pace for our slow walk to the long dining room . " In Florida . " She said the name of the state as though it were something very strange and not quite nice . " He takes the boat . He has horses there . Do you like horses , Mr. Schermerhorn Schuy-ler ? " I did my best with that one . In fact , I did my best through the long luxurious dinner , for I was on Mrs. Astor 's right  --  taking precedence as a sort of foreigner . The motif of the dining room was of the purest , heaviest , most expensively wrought gold . Candelabra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the roses ( mystical ? ) that decorated the table had a gold look to them . But one works hard to sit in that high place , to eat that superbp103dinner . Conversation with Mrs. Astor is not easy , for she is swift to exclude whole subjects . As usual , I did not mention literature . That is for others to do if they are so minded . She was not so minded . She did not , she felt obliged to say , find much worth reading nowadays . But , graciously , she admitted to enjoying the illustrations to my article on the Empress Eugenie . On music she is better . She has seen and sometimes heard the second act of all the great operas . Painting and sculpture ? No response except to praise her own things . I moved boldly to grave matters . I told her that I was soon to go to Washington City . I would be dealing with the President . My hope of impressing her was stopped dead with an absolute exclusion . " I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave right here ? " I babbled , implying , idiotically , that she remain forever seated at her own dinner table , while footmen filled golden goblets with Chateau Margaux . " I go to Ferncliff . " This was an announcement . It is the name of the house that her husband has built up the Hudson at Rhinebeck . " I also go to Newport . I have a cottage there . You and the Princess must visit us . One goes first by the cars to Boston . Then one changes to the cars of the Fall River line . " That , I think , gives the flavour of our conversation . At one point she did press me hard on the Schermerhorn connection ; happily , I was able , without once lying , to convince her that we were indeed cousins . Since the dinner lasted three hours , I feel now that I know Mrs. Astor as well as I shall ever want to . Alternate courses were a relief because I had Mrs. Sanford to myright.She knew exactly what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must say ( as a result of the contrast ? ) she seems to me now a sort of angel of good sense and kindness ; also , swift , oh , eery swift to get the point to things . She is remarkably like Emma in that regard . At about eleven Mrs. Astor rose from her place  --  in the middle of a sentence to me on the difficulties of finding footmen who would not drink up what was left in the bottles . With a marvelloussilken , whispery , jingling sound , the ladies followed Mrs. Astor to the vast art gallery that runs parallel to the dining room . In the dining room the gentlemen huddled together , testing the port , the madeira . I found myself joined on the one side by the solicitous McAI/lister : " She was enchanted by you . I can tell our Rose 's every mood . " And on my other side was William Sanford , looking more glamourous than ever , and already breathing cigar smoke . " So how 's the old tin oven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I responded with all the pomp of Mrs. Astor . " If I had a tin oven , Mr. Sanford , I would hope that it worked properly . " " You must pardon an old railroad man . That 's one of our expressions . " He went on for a while , spinning yet another identityfor himself  --  a sort of diamond in the rough Commodore Vanderbilt type , straight-talking and mean as a snake . I found him tiring in this vein ; happily , he is not slow to see what effect he is making and so changed entirely his manner . " We enjoyed the Princess 's company at lunch . As did the Bel-monts . " " So Mrs. Sanford told me . " I was deliberately flat ; do not really care to encourage this peculiar acquaintance . " I hope the Princess was amused . " " She has said nothing to me about what must have been somethingof a gala . " " Yes . " The grey eyes were very round now ; and calculating  --  what ? How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We hope that you both will visit us at Newport , Rhode Island , in June . " " June is a long time away . Besides , " I added , inspired , " we 're committed to Mrs. Astor . " " Beechwood 's uncomfortable . " I gathered that this was the name of the Astor cottage . " Besides I may have to be at the nominating conventions . Emma is eager to see St. Louis and Cincinnati , not to mention the god Demos in action . " If Sanford believed a word of this , he would , as they say here , believe anything . But I laid it on . " Of course . " Sanford was mild . " Conkling 's the man , you know . " " To be nominated for president ? " Sanford nodded , slowly , deliberately , as if he himself were kingmaker . " It 's all been arranged by the Stalwarts , and in spite of all your reformers like Bristow and Schurz , Tom Murphy and Chet Arthur will decide who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Is it true that General Grant would like a third term ? " " Mrs. Grant would dearly like it and I suppose he would , too . But this Babcock thing . . . " Sanford shook his head , affecting sadness . " Not to mention the constant fussing of your reformers , going on and on about Civil Service reform , like crazy fools . " I agreed that it was foolish to want to reform the Civil Service when it is plainly not possible under the present party system which requires that the incoming political party replace everyone in the departments of the government with their own supporters who are , to a man , every bit as undeserving and as unqualified as those whose places they have usurped . This has been going on all my life . Lately , examinations have been given to would-be governmentworkers with , predictably , farcical results . Much quoted in the town is the reply of one of Collector Arthur 's pets to the examiner 's question , " By what process is a statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Republican answered , " Never saw one erected and do n't know the process . " " You have not met Senator Conkling , have you ? " I said that I had met him briefly last summer . " An impressive man , a superb orator , vain as can be , of course . The ladies think the world of him . " " Yes . Particularly our friend Mrs. Sprague . " A look of interest was bestowed on me like a prize for deportment . " Well , now , you do n't say ? " " So I do say . Mrs. Sprague has been living in Paris , you know . She has an apartment near the Madeleine , in the Rue Duphot . " I piled on the details . " An uncommonly handsome woman . " " She is indeed . " " I guess Kate Chase Sprague is the closest thing to a queen we 've ever had in this country . " Sanford lowered his voice . " Must n't let McAllister hear me say that or he 'll push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mrs. Astor is just New York , while Kate was queen of Washington , of politics , right until ' 73 . I'hen it was all over . Funny thing . I warned Sprague that the Panic was on its way , but there was no talking to that man . There never is . When he 's not drunk  --  which is rare  --  he 's just plain eccentric . Of the two , Kate has the brains . " " But apparently those brains are now at the service of Senator Conkling and not of Senator Sprague . " The most talked-of Washingtonliaison is that between Roscoe Conkling , the beautifulitp106senator from New York and master of his state 's Republican party and Kate Chase Sprague , the beautiful daughter of the rather plain late Chief Justice and would-be president Salmon P. Chase , as well as wretched wife to the mad little senator from Rhode Island , William Sprague . Emma sees a good deal of Kate at Paris ; finds her deeply embittered , resenting an exile not unlike that of our Empress but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at Chislehurst . Of all the Americans who have come our way in France , Emma took most to Kate , as she calls her , and I must say that despite the gloomy setting in the Rue Duphot the woman does have the curious gleam one notices in those who have been not only at a world 's centre but for a time the focal point of that world 's interest . Kate has been in Paris for almost two years now ; separated from her husband by an ocean  --  and a thousand bottles ; from her lover Conkling by the force of society , not to mention that young man 's ambition , for he is , as Sanford says , a contender for the presidency next year . Sudden thought : This puts me in a curious dilemma . Should Conkling be the candidate and should I be at work for Tilden , what then ought my attitude be when the scandal of Kate and Conkling becomes a part of the ever-dingy electoral process ? I shall have no attitude  --  and hope that the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RepresentativesJames G. Blaine . Certainly I shall keep to myself the fact that by accident last summer , I met Senator Conkling at Mrs. Sprague 's apartment . He was standing in the front doorway just before teatime , saying good-bye to her . She made the presentations in such a hurried , flustered way that had I not recognized from newspaper cartoons the tall , rather stout Adonis of Republican politics , I might have thought her caller some sort of overdressed professional man , like the Empress 's friend and dentist Dr. Evans . " It is a fascinating game . " Sanford puffed on his cigar . " I think about it sometimes for myself . " " Politics ? " " Yes . If you have the money and the feel of the thing , why , it 's as simple as can be . It would take me maybe two hundred thousand dollars to buy a seat in the Senate . Conkling paid a bit more for his seat but then New York 's more prosperous than Rhode island . "  | " But why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Senate in order to acquire the sort of money that you already have ? " Sanford laughed . " Good point ! I suppose it 's to see if you can get the top prize . Become the president . After all , that 's worth having for itself , is n't it ? " " I ca n't think why . As far as I can tell , our presidents have almost no function , except perhaps in wartime . " " But they are there ! Do n't you see ? Now , when you worry about corruption  --  " " Mr. Sanford , I promise you that I have not lost a moment 's sleep at the thought of a bribe given or received . " " Sir , I know your writing . I know who your friends are . You 're shocked by all this . But how else can you run a country where half the people do n't even speak English and everybody 's in a scramble to get his share of the pie ? I 'll tell you something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . I do n't like anything about this so-called democracy . I 'd like a well-run country with honest people in the government , the way they have in Prussia ... " " A tyranny ? " " If that 's the only way to clean things up , make things run right , well , I 'd accept that . " " With yourself as the tyrant , naturally . " " Oh , I 'd accept that in a flash ! " He laughed to show that he was not joking . " Mrs. Sprague has true tong . " ' My other ear was duly filled with the sound of McAllister 's voice ; he had heard a magical name and responded in character . " Whenever I hear New Yorkerssay there is no society at Washington , I say , why , you have never been to Mrs. Sprague 's for New Year 's Day nor seen her enter a room , any room , with her hair done in braids like a coronet , and those marvellous jewels . Gone now , I should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the Spragues . " This last item was added as if it were a charming detail of the poor woman 's regalia . McAllister then gave me a recipe for terrapin , " taught me by a Maryland darkey , " involving a good deal of cream and butter . I le also asked me if I had noticed how Americans of the same class say " sir " to one another whereas in England only servants say " sir . " " But we do say sir ' in England . To royalty . " I was benign.  |p108Tears  came to McAllister 's eyes . " Some years ago , just as I was being presented to the Prince of Wales , the very instant he heard the Mac ' part of my name , he turned away . " I consoled McAllister as best I could until the evening ended at the mystical and roseate hour of midnight . In the garnet drawing room Mrs. Astor stood , dark and commanding . As her guests filed past , they touched her hand as though it were an idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the touch ; so did Emma . " We hope to see a great deal of you while you are in New York . " The sentence was , as it were , not said but passed . McAllister immediately proposed , " The next Patriarchs ' Ball ? " " Yes . " So Queen Elizabeth might have raised from obscurity to the splendour of an earldom a common border Cecil , or Louis XIV with a nod of his wig bade a courtier to join him in the country at Marly and rich preferment . The Sanfords said good-bye to us in the foyer . I find her entirelysympathetic but can not warm to him . If he would only stick with a single performance , perhaps I could bear him more easily . But the constant shifts from plain-spoken man of the people , all hideously self-made , to thoughtful Darwinist and social historian is rather more than I can take . After we got home I said to Emma , " I had n't known you joined the Sanfords for lunch . " " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already in my dressing gown before the fire , getting ready to make these notes . Emma was still in her evening gown , still Winterhalter though her face looked grey and tired , and I noted with the eye , I fear , of a realistic writer rather than with the loving gaze of an adoring father that , when tired , the lines on either side of her lower lip become deep and threaten one day to forge dewlaps like her mother 's , like mine . " At the last moment I could n't face another excursion into Apgar-land and so I telegraphed the Sanfords yes ' having already said no . ' " " Was it amusing ? " " The Belmonts are easy . Not at all American . " Then Emma spoke analytically of tonight 's guests . I waited for her to get round to Sanford but she did not . " I like Mrs. Sanford . " I made my move.  | " So do I. " Emma seemed enthusiastic . The old coals in the grate suddenly fell in upon themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rosy , young again . " But I do n't think she must have an easy time of it . " " With him ? " Emma nodded , staring at the flames ; slowly she removed paste rings . " I have the impression he overpowers her . Forces her to do things she would rather not . " " Like go to Mrs. Astor 's ? " " Worse , I should think . " " Worse ? How ? " I was intrigued , but Emma was not in the mood to play our usual game of penetrating the disguises people wear . " A philanderer ? " was the most obvious attempt I could make to compel her attention , but Emma only smiled . " I should n't think he had that sort of energy . " " What an astonishing thing to say ! That is an energy few men lack . And Sanford 's not yet forty . " " I do n't know , Papa . " Emma shifted to French . " I just said the first thing that came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish him joy . " Emma kissed my cheek , I kissed her hand : our old ritual . " Did he apologize for the flowers he sent you ? " " They were never mentioned . The vulgar have their own kind of tact , Papa . " Then she was gone . I can not think why I allow Sanford to disturb me . I suppose it is because he has made it perfectly clear that he means to seduce Emma . Thank God , he has no chance if her mind is made up elsewhere , as I believe it to be in Apgar-land . Also , I suspect that Emma is not by nature amorous . She is too cool , too cautious , too possessed of a sense of the ridiculous ever to let go . I could imagine her turning from a drunken mad husband like Sprague to a man of power like Conkling , but I can not imagine that she would ever allow herself to become involved with someone like William Sanford , a married man without glory or charm , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of character . Yet why am I so alarmed ? I do not really believe in heredity as much as I do in the ordinary circumstances that shape a life , but there is no doubt that Emma and I have in our veins most curious blood . I am the illegitimate son of Aaron Burr , and though I do not much resemble in appearance or character that elusive , marvellous , amoral man , I do sometimes see , staring atp110me from beneath Emma 's beautiful level brows , the eyes of Aaron Burr , absolutely intense and entirely resolute  --  the eyes of a world conqueror . At such moments , she is as strange and magical to me as he was in life , as he is in memory . HE GREAT DAY BEGAN with a snowstorm and a telegram from Governor Tilden , asking me to come see him at five o'clock , in order to talk before the dinner party . Emma and I studied the message carefully and decided that she was not included at this meeting . " I 'll come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there is no one she could go with except the Bigelows , and they would simply walk around the corner from their own house in Gramercy Park . At exactly five o'clock I arrived in Gramercy Park to find the air filled with a fine snow that the north wind with a most unAmericanfairness was trying to deposit on everything equally . The gas lamps had already been lit ( because the Governor was in residence ? ) and their small pale halos hung in the middle air like so many purgatorial angels . A servant showed me into an upstairs study , very much the sort of bookish retreat one would expect a wealthy lawyer with literarytastes to assemble . Seated in front of  --  that New York rarity  --  a wood fire ( how sick I am of the smell of burning anthracite ) was the imposing figure of a man in his fifties with short-cut dark hair and a somewhat belligerent face . As I entered the room he was entirely concentrated on reading a sheaf of papers . When my presence was detected , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowly crushed it . " I 'm Comptroller Green , Mr. Schuyler . The Governor 's resting just now . Will you take tea ? Something stronger ? " Something stronger was brought me . Mr. Green took nothing . " We 're still at work on the Governor 's speech to the legislaturep111next week . " He struck the sheaf of papers with his fist . " This ought to set them on their ear ! " I did not ask whose ear would be set on , but assumed that he had the Republicans in mind . I drank Scotch whisky ; spoke blandly , " Certainly the whole country will be listening to the Governor . " " Just what I tell that staff of his ! Oh , they are . . . " But Green decided he did not know me well enough to give me his view of the Governor 's staff . " You are the comptroller of  --  New York City ? " A foolish sort of question ( though I made it sound a statement ) , for such men think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No doubt for my sins in an earlier life . Last job in the world I wanted . But the Governor insisted . So I am heir to the Tweed debacle . " My magpie brain retains from the thousands of lines of newspaperprint I feed it each day all sorts of odd useful facts . " AndrewH . Green " appeared in bold black letters behind my eyelids . The Sun . No , the Herald . I proceeded to read aloud from the newspaper in my head , " And of course we all hope that from the comptrollership you , Mr. Green , will become a reforming mayor . " I let the editorial extrude smoothly , as though I had never for a day left Manhattan Island and its affairs . Green flushed agreeably . " Well , there 's been talk , but I do n't think an honest comptroller of the city 's finances is apt to be very popular with the bosses in the wards . " " Then let us hope you move on with the Governor to Washing-ton . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organiz-ing . " " Our friend Bigelow  --  " " Does what he can . " A slight edge to the voice , and I felt at home  --  at court again . It is all like a dim provincial version of the Tuileries , where grown men and women used to spend their days and nights plotting to arrange , as if by accident , five minutes alone with the Emperor on the stairs , in a garden , anywhere that the imperial quarry might for an instant be snared and used in order to rise in the world . Green has been a law partner and intimate of the Governor for , he told me , thirty-three years . " A long time , is n't it ? " Green shook his head at the idea of a century 's third . " I was just a boyp112of twenty-one when I went into his law office . I thought then that he was the most brilliant man I 'd ever met . I still do . He  --  is like an older brother to me . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tildencould instill such ardour in an associate . Tilden is plainly a more complicated man than I first thought those pleasant days in Geneva when I simply saw the precise lawyer , the ruthless politician , the monomaniac  --  a word I have several times heard people use when referring to him . Certainly , once he has got hold of a subject , he does not easily let it go until he 's shaken all the life from it , like the terrier I saw chew to bits rat after rat the other afternoon in a so-called pit just back of City Hall . One of the doors into the study was opened by a tall young man , carrying a small valise . " The Governor 's resting fine , Mr. Green . " " Thank you , Ben . You know your way out . " " Yes , sir . " The young man nodded politely in my direction , acknowledging the presence of a gentleman whilst emphasizing his own position so much further down the long American social ladder . When the lad was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massages . You see , I ca n't get the Governor to exercise properly . He likes to ride , but nothing else , and who can ride in this weather ? So naturally his blood just accumulates in the veins , which is very unhealthy . I tell him that he should be massaged every day , but I know for a fact that when he 's at Albany he never stirs from his desk . Not that he is n't in the very best of health for a man of his age , " Green suddenly added , realizing that the condition of a presidential candidate 's body is far more important than the contents , if any , of his mind . " Andy ! " The familiar , rather feeble voice sounded from the next room . Green excused himself and joined his chief . I looked about the room . Family portraits , law books , a statuary group of a soldier fallen in the late war , head cradled in the lap of a grieving friend . I found myself wondering , idly , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , quite by chance , from a bookseller in London ; apparently the Governor has been secretly collecting lurid works for many years . Thus bachelors amuse themselves . Green re-entered the room so silently that I started guiltily , asp113if I had been caught at some indiscretion by examining even in a desultory way the life-like figures created by the celebrated John Rogers . " I gave that to the Governor . If you like , you can go in . He 's resting , of course ... " A single lamp on a table beside the bed illuminated what at first appeared to be an emaciated corpse  --  at least the lower part looked wasted away , for Tilden 's legs as outlined beneath the single sheet that covered him are as thin as a crane 's . The rest of him is more in the usual scale . Although a year younger than I , he seems to me to be very much my senior . Cautiously I approached the bed , where the Governor lay flat on his back , arms at his sides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his friend Green . He wears no moustache , beard or side whiskers . If only for this continence , I hope that he becomes the president and sets the nation a new style . Since the war no one has actually been able to get a good look at any American face , so fantastic are the beards and whiskers , in imitationfor the most part of General Grant . In the half-light of a single kerosene lamp , Tilden looked to be all grey like a corpse . Later in the full light at dinner , his face proved to be almost as grey and corpse-like as when I found myself staring down at the sheeted figure , at the pale face with the large nose and curiously arched upper lip ( dentures that do not fit ? ) . Then the eyes opened . I should like to report that the effect was as electrifying as , Paris friends assure me , that of the first Napoleonwhen suddenly he gazed upon friend or foe . But such was not the case with Governor Tilden . Rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of their own accord , opened and looked up at me , as from the half-shell . Were I holding a lemon , I might have squeezed it . " Mr. Schuyler . " The voice was faint . " Please draw up a chair . And forgive me for receiving you like this . You are very good to put up with me . " " Not at all . " I made cheerful sounds as I placed a chair beside the bed . The Governor again shut his eyes . The lids are prominentand , even when raised , give a secret , hooded look to the dull grey eyes . I noted a slight droop to the left eyelid , the result of the mild stroke he suffered last February ( and , to date , kept hiddenfrom the public ) . I sat down , feeling a bit absurd , like a doctor the wrong deathbed . For a moment there was no sound in thep114room but the regular soft belching of the Governor . He is a martyr to dyspepsia , and massage seems not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Schuyler , is your view of the order of the Grey Nuns ? " " Most benevolent . " I improvised until I realized what he was talking about . Apparently , the Governor had signed a bill allowingthe nuns to teach in the common schools . As a result , there is much Catholic-baiting going on . The Tribune is up in arms and the Evening Post wants the law repealed at the next session of the legislature . " I must decide what position to take before next week . It is most perplexing . Much of our Democratic support is Catholic . But then there are all those Baptists and Presbyterians in the party , too . Such a noise they make . . . " Tilden sighed . The hatred of the Catholics is still very strong in the city , particularly in such liberal circles as Harper 's Weekly , where the celebrated cartoonist Thomas Nast , himself a German-born immigrant , wages a constant war on the papacy . " When in doubt take no position . " I was wise . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a position . " This was unexpectedly sharp , even presidential . My pulse beat faster as I realized that I must not through inadvertent attempts at wit seal up the future fount of honour . " If the legislature originated the bill , " I said quickly , " let them take the responsibility for it . " " Spoken like a lawyer . " A slight raising of the awning-like upper lip served its owner well enough for a smile . " I must tell you , Mr. Schuyler , that I have read with care your reports on Europe and they are masterful in their detail . You have made me think new thoughts about the relationship between France and Prussia . " " You flatter me ... " A series , or glissade , of tiny belches interrupted us . Tilden is so used to them that he does not seem aware when they occur . When they ceased , he observed , " Bigelow is such a Prussian , you know . " " We have argued about that . " I took my stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire the efficiency of the Germans at the expense of , let us say , the humanity and the creativity of the French . "  | " Yes . I have read you . " Tilden was dry . Like me , he does not enjoy being told things that he already knows . " I also need your views to counterbalance Bigelow . He is convinced that in the next century there will be only three great powers  --  Germany , Russia and the United States . " " I lack the gift of prophecy , Governor . But in this century I am at your service now and  --  later . " That was as close as I dared come to a request . " Should there be a later , ' I would certainly not let such a mind as yours go unused . " There it was  --  as good as in writing . No , better ! For a lawyer as subtle as Tilden can never make a written agreement without arranging for himself , amongst the qualifying clauses , an escape hatch . The spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his written bond . We spoke a bit more of foreign affairs . I told him then of my assignment for the Herald . " Not a favourite newspaper . " The grey lip curled back : grey teeth shone dully . " But powerful . " " I could , I think , be of some use to the party . Not so much inwhat I write about General Grant , who seems already retired , 4 but more particularly about his heirs , and your future rival . " " Blaine . " The word was said softly , without emphasis . " Conkling ? " The grey head rolled from side to side  --  at first , to indicate a negative , but then , finding pleasure in that rocking motion , in the easing of the muscles of the neck , the rolling continued . " I think Conkling will be no problem for us . Blaine is something else . Fortunately , he is corrupt . " " Does the public care ? " " I can make them care as I have made them care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds with the Caesarean statement . " No , Mr. Schuyler , we need fear only the good , the honest man , like Mr. Bristow at the Treasury . But such a man will never be chosen by the Republican party . Never . So  --  Blaine . " In the dim light I detected the makings of a most decent smallscalesmile . Green and a manservant entered . " Time to dress , Governor . The guests will be coming any minute . The Bigelows are already here . " " ' Thank you , Mr. Schuyler . " ' I'ilden 's hand took mine for ap116moment and pressed it  --  a relatively strong grip , I noted . " You are the sort of man we need in public life . One who is able to limit theory by practice "  --  there was a slight strangled sound as he held back a larger than ordinary belch  --  " yet enlighten practice by theory . " On that high note , I joined the Bigelows in the main drawing room . All in all , a successful evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tilden 's right at dinner and I think she managed to charm him , if any one can . There were a half-dozen Tilden relatives present , enjoying Christmas Eve with the family'srichest and most famous member . The Tildens are from Columbia County , close to where my mother 's family lived , to where Martin Van Buren lived . In fact , the old President was a friend of Tilden 's father and a benefactor to the Governor in his youth , as he was to me . But then Van Buren and I shared the same father . We were both illegitimate sons to Aaron Burr ; needless to say , neither of us ever acknowledgedthis consanguinity to the other . Nevertheless , one of the strongest links between Tilden and me is the Van Buren connection . Tonight , when the Governor commented on my physical resemblance to the great man , I responded with an exact replica of Van Buren 's secret smile which made the stony expression of the Egyptian Sphinx seem positively open and garrulous . Bigelow was in good spirits , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the address to the legislature . I do n't know how he does it . " Bigelow indicated Tilden , who looked reasonably fit , the belching controlled by a constant nibbling at dry biscuits . " He lives on tea . He is an addict , I tell him . " " Better tea than whisky , as is reputed . " " You 've heard those rumours ? " Bigelow did not seem overly concerned . " Only in Republican households . " " Like the Apgars ? " Bigelow gave me a sidelong smile , and filled my glass with madeira . The ladies had withdrawn . Tilden drank tea , nibbled biscuits , listened as Green whispered into one of his ears and an adviser on economics named Wells in the other ear . " How does the Governor listen to two conversations simultane-ously ? " " He 's still got a lot of snap . " Bigelow was admiring . " You were worried about him , his health ... " " I still am . But I accept the fact that he enjoys ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop working . So be it . After Grant , who would not work at the presidency  --  even had he understood the job  --  the Governor will be refreshing . At the moment all of us are exhausted except for the Governor . But then he has no life , you see , except the law and politics . " " If elected , will he marry ? " Bigelow tapped the half-empty glass of soda water in front of him  --  an abstemious group , the Tilden ring . " I think so . After all , a wife would ease his days in the White House . " " Obviously a man of passionate nature . " I was moderately reckless after two glasses of madeira and a splendid hock earlier on . " Odd , is n't it ? " Bigelow took my irony in good part . " Has he ever shown an interest in the ladies ? " Bigelow shook his head . " Never . It is curious . But also , in another way , admirable . I mean he is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear Bigelow , are not removed but remove themselves from temptation . " " Then he is simply chosen to be what he is , a constant worker in the public 's interest . Green is the same . " " Mr. Green has never married ? " " Never . He , too , lives for his work . " " Another demi-saint ? " I think the puritan Bigelow really does admire these flawed men . Not that I regard bachelorhood as a flaw ; rather , the contrary . But apparently neither Tilden nor Green has had any commerce at all with women , with that half of the world who have given me , certainly , not only pleasure but a necessary measure of the common humanity . Had I not Emma , I would make another . Or , considering my advanced age , adopt , kidnap , seduce or otherwise acquire that feminine company withoutwhich I simply can not breathe . The New York world of men 's clubs and bars , of back-room politics and of sportsmen 's pavilions is no world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wily in the company of ladies . Incidentally ( why incidentally ' ? All-importantly ! ) , Bigelow said , " The Governor will name you minister to almost any post you might want , saving that at St. James 's . " " You do n't know what this means to me . " My voice grew hoarse with real emotion . Such an appointment does mean everything to me  --  once Emma is married , of course.  | " In foreign affairs , you are one of our brightest stars , except for your unfortunate passion for the French , " Bigelow added ; and the mood lightened . " Then you should be pleased with last Saturday 's gush publishedunder my name in the Ledger . " " It did not sound quite your style . And why did you never mention the good Dr. Evans , the Empress 's ubiquitous dentist ? What 's become of him ? " " Still pulling teeth , I should think . " Happily , we gossiped about the old good times in Paris , never to come again . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thiers and , in general , of the Third and current French Republic , but he is deeply , mysteriously anti-French . I put it down to his essential puritanism . Bigelow hates the Roman Church with a passion worthy of the true Republican he was until he became New York 's secretary of state and a Democrat . For decades Bigelowhas been assuring me that the wickedest and most rapacious force in the world is the papacy , which one day soon will collide in a perfect Armageddon with virtuous Protestantism , setting off a new , more bloody civil war right here in the United States , the Fort Sumter to be located in the old Sixth Ward , where the benighted Irish live . I confess that I , too , once shared all these prejudices , particularly in regard to the Irish , whom I looked upon as a kind of disease or blight , killing my New York . Of course they and the later immigrants did indeed destroy the old Dutch-English villageof my youth , but nothing valuable was lost . I daresay the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic countries has not only made me more tolerant than Bigelow , but also convinced me that Roman Catholic societies are more agreeable to live in than Protestant ones because they are not in the slightest degree Christian . At the end of the evening Tilden looked very tired , despite a quantity of tea and several mysterious pills . " I hope you will come to see us at Albany , once you 're finished with General Grant . " I said that I could think of no greater pleasure . Green was suddenly at Tilden 's side . Handsome , rough-hewn , he physically overshadows his slight master . " Governor , did you mention to Mr. Schuyler our plans for advertisement concoctors ? " " Not yet . Not yet . " Tilden 's voice was low ; he seemedp119annoyed . But Green was not to be stopped . He turned to me . " In the next few weeks we shall be starting a bureau , using all sorts of writers and artists to prepare material for the newspaper press ... " " Mr. Schuyler is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " Tilden 's eyes opened very wide as he held in his throat what must have been a powerful belch that slowly , and no doubt painfully , he allowed to dissipate through widely flared nostrils . " Well , Governor , you know as well as I do that we can use all the writers we can get and with Mr. Schuyler at the Ledger . . . " Mr. Schuyler is not at the Ledger . He is merely published by them . " " But , Governor  --  " I interrupted what looked to be something very like a quarrel by saying , " Actually , I have approached my publisher about doing a campaign biography . He is interested . Bigelow has promised to provide me with material . So once you are nominated ... " Both Tilden and Green liked the sound of this ; we parted in a hail of Merry Christmases and Happy New Years . The Governor'slast words to me were " I 'll see you later . " This curious phrase is often on his lips . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to quiz Emma . " Not the easiest man to talk to . " " A little chilly ? " " No . A passionate nature , I should think . " " That is not the impression I got , or anyone else . " " Well , there are all sorts of passions , are n't there ? Like my mother-in-law 's passion for money ... " " Do n't mention her ! I can feel the blood pounding in my ears . " " Or that charming Senator Conkling 's passion for Kate Sprague . " " You liked him ? " " I saw him only that one time when we exchanged ten words . " " I remember . And you said you found him vain . " " Oh , as a peacock ! With that ridiculous curl in the middle of his forehead ... " " The hyacinthine curl . I suppose he 's imitating Disraeli ... " " But when he looked at Kate , one felt here is a passionate man . "  | " Well , he had come halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he fancied meeting us . Anyway , now you 've met both party leaders . Which will it be ? Who will be the president ? Tilden or Conkling ? " " Who cares ? It 's only a game they play , Papa . It 's not impor-tant . " I detected in her voice an echo , a variation on a theme of Sanford 's . " Game or not , the result is important . " " But it is hardly like being the emperor , is it ? " Emma continues to regard the United States as an overgrown Mexico . " I admit that our presidents have very little to do . The Congressgoverns  --  and does most of the stealing . But the presidenthas many jobs to give , particularly to deserving old writers . " " Then , vive Tilden ! " Emma was in a good mood . " As for his passion ... " " Yes , how did you discover what no one has ever before no-ticed ? " " By listening to him talk about canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And  --  oh , yes , justice . " Emma was like a schoolgirl , recalling her lessons . " He said that he was appalled by the inequality of the American system of justice . The courts are for the rich , he said . " " He should know . He made his fortune representing the rich , particularly the railroads . " " Then , perhaps , he wants to atone for his sins . He is a good man , Papa , if absurd . " " I do n't find him absurd , and doubt if he is good . " " Because you are a man . And an American . I only wish that he was less flatulent . " " A thunderer , like Prince Metternich ? " " No , a whistler like Prince Napoleon . " We laughed at the old joke . I said that I thought his real and only passion is ill health . " No matter . I am sure that he will make a most amusing president , if such a thing is possible . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I think not . He is like an old capon . " Thus we discussed the next president , and the restorer of our  --  my  --  fortunes.  |p121Emma  went to bed , and I worked for a time on Cavour . Not easy work . I dread the prospect of writing a campaign biography , but if I must I must . Besides , I am sure that some ambitious young man in Mr. Dutton 's office will be able to take the actual task in hand , with a grace note or two from me.  |p122NEW  YEAR 'S DAY , 1876 . The Year of the Centennial , as every newspaper proclaims . I must say that if this new year continues at the same pace as the last month of the old year , I shall not survive until 1877 . Emma and I continue to go round and round if not up and up . We attended a Patriarchs ' Ball at Delmonico 's , in the Blue Ballroom : " So difficult to decorate , " complained McAllister , who rules society whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Mystic Rose in her box at the Academy of Music and actually heard a few snatches of Verdi during those rare moments when the gentry were silent . The ball afterwards was of no great interest . The Belmonts ' gala proved to be much livelier than the Astor levee , and in a way more grand , for not only were there more Europeans but the women were far better-looking than those to be found at Mrs. Astor 's . Obviously it is Ward McAllister 's ambition to be the Prince Albert of New York , creating for his Victoriaa sumptuous self-satisfied and pre-eminently dull court . Inp123contrast , the rival court of the Belmonts is to the Astors ' Windsor a sort of Tuileries : brilliant , amusing , a bit vulgar and entirely delightful . Right off , in front of Mrs. Belmont , August Belmont declared his admiration for Emma ; and his wife only sighed . " Now , " she said to Emma , " he will never cease to plague you . Too boring ! " But today , of course , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cold dull living rooms of the Third Brother , the Nine Brothers with their hundreds of family connections lauded Emma on her engagement , on her translation from French widow to serious Apgar-ish niceness . John was charming and awkward and rather appealing  --  to me . I suspect that Emma does not like him much but she has been trained like all members of her class to do what must be done gracefully and without complaint . Since there is no alternative to this marriage , Emma has accepted her role with every outward sign of enjoyment . Sister Faith was scarlet with pleasure , and kept hugging Emma , speechless at their new relationship . Emma soothed Faith , charmed the rest . Toasts were proposed in the dining room , where we dined a la fourchette . I was tactful . The Nine Apgars were heavy . The relatives were fascinated by this unlikely glamourous new connection . I had forgotten , of course ( why , of course ? my memory is still very good ) the old New York Dutch custom of paying calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is still observed . And so not only did we enjoy the official gathering of the entire Apgar clan but we were also able to accept the congratulations of every " nice " person in the city who came to call , and if Mrs. Apgar is to be believed , only the bedridden remained at home . " That 's why we picked New Year 's Day for the announcement , " she told me as we stood side by side receiving an endless line of callers , most of them smelling of whisky punch . " You see , they all would be coming here anyway , so we are killing two birds with one stone . " Amongst the birds who arrived to be killed was Jamie Bennett . A majority of the Nine Brothers was noticeably cool to the proprietorof the scandalous Herald but Jamie carried it off well ; he was only slightly drunk . " Poor Emma ! " I heard him mutter in her ear . Fortunately nop124one but Emma and I heard him . She gave him her Medusa gaze , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Schuyler . " At least Jamie recalled some of his manners in that forbidding parlour with its dark walnut panelling , with its once-vivid rose-design rugs now faded to a suitable Apgar-ish rust . " Mr. Bennett . " I played to the hilt jovial father of the bride-tobe . " A pleasant surprise . " " But still a surprise ? " Jamie leered . " Not exactly one of the houses I normally visit New Year 's Day , but this time I had to , for Emma . " " The gesture is much appreciated . " " When do they get married ? " The question is still moot . There has been a good deal of talk of a Grace Church June wedding ( favoured for a time by me ) , but we have just learned that the house that John has bought in Eleventh Street ( or did the Third Brother buy it for him ? Must find out ) wo n't be habitable until October . As a result , the family is divided between the two dates . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state his own preference until she has declared hers . He did say last week that if they were married in June , they could spend the summer at his family 's place in Maine ... mosquitoes , juniper bushes , sand flies . Maine makes a very definite picture for me . Emma will opt for October , I think . Instinctively , she postponesputting such a definite end to what once was a most beautifullife . Earlier , driving down to the Third Brother 's house , she said , " We should hold a funeral for the Princess d'Agrigente . " I misunderstood her . " No such luck . That old woman will outlive us all . " The old woman , incidentally , has now demanded more money than was initially agreed upon for the support of Emma 's children . " No , I meant for me . When I become Mrs. Apgar . " " Delay ! " I was vehement , altogether too vehement . In fact , I have been so overwrought all day that now I pay the price and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I dare . " " But you are reluctant ? " " I like John . " She answered in her own fashion ; and left me nothing further to say . John took me aside after the family toasts and we stood in anp125alcove , sharing the cramped space with a life-size bronze deer . " I want you to know , sir , that I will do everything in my power to make Emma happy . " " Of course you will , dear boy . " I was on the verge of tears , not from sentiment but from one of those premonitory signals that herald the approaching stroke . I must rest more . See fewer people . Lose weight . " It 's amazing how she fits in ! Why , it 's as if she 'd always lived here . " This was John 's highest praise . I dried my eyes . " She is not unused to society . " John did not hear ; he was staring raptly at Emma . " I thought we might go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , of course . " Mosquitoes the size of quails filled my inner eye , not to mention gnats as big as rooks , circling carrion  --  if rooks eat flesh . Poor Emma . But now it is all out of my hands . I am simply an onlooker . In fact , so passive have I become that I allowed myself to be taken in hand by Jamie , who had mysteriously sobered up at the Apgar buffet table ; he insisted on taking me to pay " a very special New Year 's Day call . " Since Emma was now lost to the Apgars for the rest of the day , including supper , I was able to excuse myself , pleading age and fatigue , " and perfect boredom , Papa . " Emma whispered in French as she kissed my cheek and sent me off with Jamie . Fifth Avenue was crowded with carriages . Despite the truly arctic cold , the whole town was busy paying calls . " Where are we going ? " I asked as we lurched slowly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . I 've got more news from Washington for you . " " About Babcock ? " " About a member of the President 's official family who has been selling federal offices . When do you go to Washington ? " " February fifteenth . " " Well , you 'll be there in time . Fireworks , I should say . How do you put up with all those Apgars ? " " The same way I endured my wife 's family . " But this was an exaggeration , since the Traxlers are noted for their charm as well as for their Swiss rectitude . Approaching the spireless , raw-looking St. Patrick 's Cathedral , our carriage slowed down . " Are we to go to mass , Jamie ? I know that your father died in the arms of mother church but .. "  | " We go to other arms , Charlie . The most amusing in New York . " Somewhat to my horror , as well as secret delight , the carriage stopped in front of the brownstone and pink Parian marble mansionof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the house of course . Not a single hackdriver has neglected to point out to me the mansion where for twenty years has lived in splendour the city 's most celebrated abortionist . It is said that some of the very grandest ladies have visited the mansion , entering through a side door in Fifty-second Street . Most of Madame 's clients , however , are catered for in her Chambers Street clinic . For thirty years the pulpits and the newspaper press have denounced this fiend , but so far she has managed , luxuriously , to survive everything and everyone by the usual expedient of buying the police and the politicians . Those she can not buy she is usually able to intimidate , since , sooner or later , most families in New York have at least one member who requires Madame 's services as " midwife , " which is how she describes herself in the advertisements she places in the Herald , and , technically speaking , she is a midwife : much of her work is discreetly delivering unwanted babies and then selling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever setting foot in this house , Jamie . " " Father always said , Keep in good with your advertisers . ' Anywayshe 's a rare sort . " Madame Restell indeed proved to be a rare sort . She is about my age , very richly got up in diamonds and black lace . La Restell'sdrawing room is as pretentious as that of Mrs. Astor except that her pictures are better and the furniture not as good . The guests are almost interchangeable . By that I mean the twenty or thirty gentlemen I met are no different in kind from Ward McAllister'schosen few ; the same mixture of railroad tycoons , rich lawyers , idle clubmen . The ladies , on the other hand , are bolder and far more glittering than the ones to be seen acting as ferns and thorns to the Mystic Rose . Madame greeted me warmly . " So good of Jamie to bring you . I 've known him since he was a young lad . " " She was married to one of our compositors at the Herald . " Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much in place at all times , and that is on high . " My husband thought the world of your dear father . In fact , when Mr. Bennett was horsewhipped in the street by that politi/cian , what 's his name ? " She turned to me . " This was years ago , Mr. Schuyler . My Charlie was the first to come to old Mr. Bennett'said . " Brava , Madame Restell , I thought to myself . Jamie glowered ; then wandered off to a small parlour where a number of gentlemenwere at cards . The effect of Madame Restell 's rooms is not unlike that of an excellent men 's club . I spoke to her in French . She laughed . " I 'm no more French than you , Mr. Schuyler . My mother was called Restell , and when I set myself up in business I took her name , not wanting to embarrass others . Actually , I 'm born and bred a Gloucestershire woman . " And she does still retain the accent of her country as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , quite as low as now it is elevated . But she is not one for pretenses . " Let 's sit down . I 've been on my feet since noon . " I sat beside her on a sofa ; and took a whisky punch from a waiter in black , with a white tie like an usher at a wedding . I seem full of Hymenal images this evening , not to mention Venereal . " Are you pleased , Mr. Schuyler , that your daughter is marryingJohn Apgar ? " Madame Restell looked at me sharply from beneath dark-dyed gleaming curls . " They were only engaged an hour ago . You must have been sent a telegram . " Madame was amused . " I do n't need telegrams to know what 's happening in New York . People tell me everything . " " Your  --  clients ? " " Friends , too . I see everyone , you know . Not your friend Mrs. Astor , of course , but I 'm well acquainted with certain members of her family . " Bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospers : she is in a position to blackmail half the great families of the town . " I see just about everyone . I 'm most democratic . Except for clergymen . " She suddenly lost her good humour . " They have hounded me all my life . As if their morals were not the worst . Hypocritical old goats ! " She launched a brief tirade against one Henry Ward Beecher , a Brooklyn divine who stood trial last summer for the seduction of an associate 's wife . Since the jury could not or would not make up its mind , the Reverend Beecher still continues , according to Madame Restell , " to give his Sunday sermon in the presence of twenty former mistresses . " " Such vigour ! " I recently saw an illustration of the Reverend Beecher in . a newspaper advertisement ; he was endorsing whole/heartedly a new kind of truss . Perhaps I should buy one . " But you must admit my house is well situated . " Madame grinned more like a schoolboy than a woman dedicated to Sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral 's windows . And they can look in mine . " With relish she told me how her relentless enemy the archbishop had tried and failed to buy the land that she had built her mansion on , " simply to spite those blasted Irish goodfor-nothingpriests and bishops . So here we are , side by side , St. Patrick 's Cathedral and me ! " All in all , I found Madame Restell beguiling . She is like a very knowing Paris concierge  --  a joy to talk to as long as no one ever tells you what she has said of you behind your back . Other guests distracted her . I wandered into the parlour , where Jamie was playing at cards . He was losing money , drinking hard , and in a bad temper . I passed on into the next room , which was a small study . A man and a woman were talking intently before the fire . Recognizing the man , I started to retreat . But I was too late . William Sanford had seen me . If he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quickly decided to play the part of debonair rake based , God knows , on what ill-observed performance in the theatre . " Mr. Schuyler ! What a surprise . I did n't know you were a friend of our hostess . " " We 've only just met . If you 'll excuse me ... " " No . No . This is Mrs. Gilray . You 've seen her on the stage , I 'm sure . She 's appearing at Wallack 's now . In that new comedy ... " But Mrs. Gilray ( a well-known actress in these parts ) was too much the dedicated professional to allow herself to be further involved in Sanford 's amateur theatricals . " I must see how my friends fare with their cards . Mr. Schuyler . " A regal nod ; and she swept from the room , mistress of the grand exit as well as of Sanford . " I reckon this is a relief , after all them Astors and Belmonts . " Sanford was plebeian man-to-man . He offered me a cigar . Primly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same people of course . " I was startled at the Apgar-ish tone of my voice . Obviously that family 's dread niceness is a contagious as well as a wasting disease . " You 'd be surprised at how often the same people come here . She 's a great sport , Madame Restell . And most discreet , as a lot of our lady friends could tell us but obviously won't. "  | " So we really have no way of knowing , do we ? " But this small play was lost on him . " My wife and I intended to come down to the engagement party . But she 's been unwell since Christmas , and spending the day in bed . So I 'm a bache-lor . " " There 's nothing seriously wrong , is there ? " " No . She 's strong as an ox . Just too much going out . We 're all of us pretty low between now and Easter . Will you be going South ? " " If you mean to Washington City , yes . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Savannah . My wife 's family has a plantation just outside the town , with good shooting . It 's almost like before the war . Why do n't you and the Princess join us ? " " I shall be too busy . And my daughter , as you know , is engaged . " I said this last very slowly , like a cue laid out carefully for a bad actor . " I congratulate you . " This was swift . Sanford tried out new approaches . " But then I suppose Apgar is really the one who should be congratulated . " " You could still send a telegram . " I started to the door . I mean to make my dislike as plain as possible ; to warn him off . " I already have . And flowers to the Princess . You 'll find them at the hotel . " I stopped at the door ; for the first time , a flash of true anger . " Again , flowers ? " " From my wife and me . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tactless , was n't I ? " Sanford 's movements before the fire were boyish : he kicked at a log , then swept a hand across his small mouth as if to wipe away tell-tale stolen jam . " My daughter is an engaged woman . And that is that , Mr. Sanford . " " That is certainly something , Mr. Schuyler . " He played off me ; weakly , I thought . Now I sit in the parlour of our suite , nearly suffocated by all the flowers we have this day accumulated . Emma came home early , and went straight to bed . When I asked her about the evening , she merely sighed . " It was like always , Papa , only a little hit more so . But I do like poor John , and with encouragement we can  --  maybe  --  get him across the Atlantic . "  | " Let us pray that I become American minister . Then I can give him back his old job . " " Would n't that be marvellous ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in a quandary . Have I done the right thing , encouraging her to marry ? Obviously she must marry , and if she marries an American it must be someone like John . We could certainly have done very much worse . But what about better ? That is the problem . Given time , I think we could find her someone splendid , a young Vanderbilt perhaps . Although the Vanderbilts lack " tong , " the present generation is supposed to be as handsome as it is rich . But the tragedy is that we have not got the time , and so the Apgar in hand is everything for us ; what may be lurking in the bush we dare not wait upon . If I had the courage , I would persuade Emma to call off the engagement and then take our chances at Washington City , or at Newport . But I simply can not assume that responsibility . Tilden could be defeated and Emma might find no other husband . Two lives would be ruined . There is no alternative to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . In any case , he makes Emma nearly as nervous as he makes me . I have run out of laudanum . A sleepless night ahead . Not the most auspicious beginning for the new year . I CAN NOT BELIEVE that it has been nearly six weeks since I havewritten in this book . One by one , in stately succession , the Apgar brothers have given us dinner parties . Considering their number , we shall not have completed the rounds of that family until the time of the second centennial . At present we are doing a brother a week . Last night was number five : four to go . Emma bears up well . She makes no complaints to me or top131anyone . Outside Apgar-land , she has made only one friend , and that is Mrs. Sanford . Ordinarily , I would be alarmed at such a connection , knowing Sanford as I do or think I do . But Emma 's dislike of him is now as great as mine , particularly as her friendshipwith Denise , as she calls her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of attention . So Denise and I are forced to meet like guilty lovers for lunch or tea . Once we even met at the diorama and saw the entire burning of Moscow for ten cents . " " That must have been like old times . " Thanks to the rambling commentaries of Emma 's late father-in-law , we both feel that we were present at that celebrated bonfire . " She 's not well . " Emma frowned . " I do n't know what 's wrong , except that she has miscarriages and very much wants a child . " " If I were she  --  " " Neither would I. Not by that man . " Emma and I seldom need to finish sentences with each other  --  certainly not on the subject of Sanford . Fortunately , he has gone South , as promised . We saw him for the last time at Mrs. Astor 's New Year 's Ball , which is always held on the third Monday in January , rather like a **26;3494;TOOLONG election . For all of the Apgars ' disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day Apgar , as Emma 's fiance , should be invited to the ball , becoming the first holder of that worthy name ever to be on the list , although , as usual , Apgar connections were everywhere , proudly bearing the great names of the city despite the fact that their right to those names is more often than not based upon some fragile cadet branch or unexpectednew shoot from a famous family 's old gnarled tree . McAllister was kind to John . There is , surprisingly , a Mrs. McAllister and one or two Misses McAllister . As a mark of very special favour , John was allowed to take Mrs. McAllister in to supper . The ball was sumptuous . I deal now only in redundancies . One formal occasion in New York is very like another . The same caterer Pinard provides the same rich complicated dishes whilst the same orchestra of Mr. Lander plays the same Offenbach and St rauss tunes for the same guests who say the same things over and over to one another as they eat and eat and drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few of us are as fat as these grand New Yorkers . It is especially pitiable to watch the eyes ofp132the ladies grow round with greed as pheasants and lobsters , sorbetsand desserts , are presented them . Even those who do not betray their appetite by staring , who continue to talk with animationof other subjects , give themselves away when , without warning , a polite and cultivated syllable will suddenly drown in an excess of saliva . Yet it is a reckless woman who dares take more than a small slice of some favourite dish , for should she eat as much as she likes , she will simply faint dead away , as the corsets they wear this season are of tightest whalebone . According to Emma , many of the ladies upon arrival show off their relatively tiny waists ; then they go straight to the retiring room and with the help of overwrought maids divest themselves of their cruel corsets in a wild flurry of skirts and petticoats . These bold , sensible , full-waisted ladies are invariably the most amiable table companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called garnet drawing room , but when Mrs. Sanford saw us she turned away and Emma did the same , as if by some prearranged signal : and so that was the end of that . A few days later Mr. Sanford was on his way to Savannah , travelling with a few men friends in his own railway car . Incidentally , half the gentlemen one meets in New York invariably want to know , solicitously , if one would like to " use the car , " the way at Paris one might offer the family victoria for a day 's outing . It will be several weeks before Denise joins her husband . I hear the name Denise so much on Emma 's lips that I think of her as that , though we still address each other most formally . I ought to mention  --  that is to say , I certainly ought not to mention but can not refrain from writing  --  that I saw or rather heard Sanford the day before he went South . One of the new , to me , attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside they look perfectly ordinary : the wooden Indian is in his usual tutelary place beside the door and in the window cigar boxes are displayed . The front room also displays cigars but rather fewer than one finds in a bona-fide shop . The only false note is the much too charming saleswoman . If you are new to the establishment , she will delicately probe and should you be an actual innocent she will sell you a cigar and send you on your way . Otherwise , she will want to get a sense of your tastes , your connections . Sometimes it helps to mention the name of a girl in the house orp133that of a client ( invariably pseudonymous ) . Once the mistress of the cigarine revels is satisfied that you are both serious and respectable , she will usher you into a back room where a number of girls sit about in a parlour no different from a thousand other middle-class parlours in the city . Sotto voce , you tell the cigar-lady which girl you want ; then you go to your room upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and joy ! I have once or twice  --  well , three or four times  --  availed myself of this convenient and inexpensive service . Convenient because one can slip out of the hotel , cross Madison Square , and there in Twenty-fourth Street know rapture in the upper reaches of the Royal Havana Cigar Shop Co . Age and health preclude the sort of performance that the young Charlie Schuyler was capable of , but to each season its pleasures ; and I do believe that I feel better for my current attemptsthan ever I did for my youthful accomplishments . I should say that half the respectable male population of New York use these cigar shops because of their ease , cheapness and convenience . The businessman can disport himself before lunch at his club , the family man can relieve himself before the evening meal with his loved ones whilst the lawyer en route to the Court House can reduce seminal pressures and still be present when the first session begins . In any case , as I was seated in the parlour , drinking tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tactfully hidden from one another ) , I heard Sanford 's voice say , " If Niobe 's on hand , then so am I. " A woman 's voice assured Sanford that Niobe would join him presently . I could hear his heavy tread on the carpeted stairs directly above us . " That is my friend Mr. Sanford , " I said , with absolute malice to the proprietress , a charming woman with a piquant face only slightly marred by a harelip . " I would n't know his name . " She lied to impress me with her discretion more than to protect him . " He was the first to tell me about you . " " Well , whoever he is , he 's a good customer . The girls do likelion . " " When he comes down , do tell him that Mr. Thomas Apgar is forever in his debt . " " I will , sir . " Yes , I have appropriated the name of the Thirdp134Brother as my nom de guerre or rather d'amour . Since the proprietressis a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled to have as her client such a kindly old gentleman as Mr. Thomas Apgar , whose son will soon be marrying a beauteous French princess . " That picture of her in Ritzman 's really quite takes your breath away ! " " I firmly believe , " I said Apgar-ishly , " that despite her being French , she will make my son a good wife . " It is now the night of February 14  --  no , the morning of February15  --  and our trunks have already been sent on ahead to Willard'sHotel in Washington . This afternoon , when confronted with the Fifth Avenue Hotel bill , I nearly departed this life . From January 5 , when I paid our first month 's bill through February 14 , we owed $1,800 ! or slightly more than half my present fortune , since I have received only a small advance from Jamie and nothing so far from the Ledger for The Last Days of Napoleon III . The Nation will pay me its few pennies for Cavour only upon publication . So I was in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the premises . He showed the bill to the manager , who admitted that there were serious errors in the addition . Eventually , mercifully , the total bill was reduced by close to a third . " Why , we should be paying you and the Princess just for the advertising your being here brings us ! " The Colonel was too kind ; and I said so . After all , the Fifth Avenue Hotel is the place where presidents and kings stay . " Well , Mrs. Stevens thinks the world of you . Come on . Let 's have an eye-opener . " The good Colonel led me into the Amen Corner . " Just for a moment . We 're due at Mr. Peter Marie 's tea party . " " You 're certainly meeting the whole kit and caboodle ! " exclaimedthe Colonel . The elegant Mr. Marie is the Saint-Simon of New York . No , that is not quite right . McAllister is the one who worries about precedence . The exquisite Mr. Marie is more a masculine  --  well , fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of conversation flourish on Manhattan Island . Each St. Valentine 's Day he writes his invitations in verse and expects one to answer in verse . A prize is given to the best acceptance poem as well as for other set pieces . He is a gallant if absurd old creature.  |p135Those  excluded from this particular social alp see only the absurdity or , as the Colonel said , " Hope you and the Princess wo n't be too bored . " " We are so tired that we are beyond boredom . " This is perfectlytrue . Each of us would like to sleep for a month . I dread the plunge into Washington society , which , I gather , is even busier than New York 's , as well as a good deal more raw . At that moment Bryant entered the Amen Corner with several men , of whom one was the amiable Collector of the Port and another was Senator Roscoe Conkling , whose enormous torso always looks as if it is about to burst the tight stylish suits he affects . On this occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is what lady novelists call leonine , and its thinning , wiry grey-red hair is brushed straight back from the broad forehead at whose center is a perfect curl , the celebrated hyacinthine lock . Beneath Olympian brow and ephebic twist of hair , the small light-coloured eyes are as alert as those of some jungle cat . " Forgive me ! " The Colonel leapt to his feet to greet the great men . As I made my way past them , trying to look invisible , the ever-punctilious Bryant stopped me . " Dear Schuyler . " I was required to receive one by one the introductions Bryant made . By accident I was so close to Conkling when we shook hands that my face was almost crushed into the proud tweed curve of the Senator 's upper belly or lower chest , the two having long since merged to make a Republican colossus . Happily for me , he smells most appetizingly of violet water and good cigars . The other men proved to be leaders of the state 's regular Republican party . Known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform and hence fierce supporters of General Grant and of the spoils system . I suppose old Bryant must stay in with everyone , just as everyone must stay in , or try to stay in , with him and with the Post . " Mr. Schuyler is an old colleague . " The Stalwarts affected to know all about me except for Conkling , who had neither listened to my name nor looked at me . He stared over my head , lost in Olympian meditation . Bryant was gracious . " Mr. Schuyler will be describing the Centennial Exhibition for us. " l le added for my benefit , " It will be opened on May tenth . "  |p136The  genial Collector Arthur wanted to know : " When will you be going back to Paris , Mr. Schuyler ? " " Not until after the election . And my daughter 's marriage .... " As I spoke I noted with some amusement that on the word " Paris , " Conkling 's head had gone abruptly from the heights to the foothills  --  that is , to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily loud and resonant voice was now low and caressing . " I was so preoccupied that I did n't hear your name properly . " " But then we met so briefly last summer . " I was vague and self-effacing . " And you must meet so many people . " " Not like you , Mr. Schuyler . And certainly not like your magnificentdaughter ... " " I read that she is to be married into a good Republican family . " Bryant broke short a potentially dangerous exchange . Whilst our finest poet spoke of politics and Apgars , I could feel from Conkling a wave of almost electrical energy , of warning . The man 's animal force is impressive , even disturbing . But Conkling 's secret is safe enough with me ; not that there is much of a secret , since everyone in political life knows of his affair with Kate , including her husband . Fortunately , from the lovers ' point of view , Sprague 's recent bankruptcy has so aggravatedhis drinking that he is now as invisible as Conkling 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Tea and dinner with old Mr. Marie made a fitting coda to this phase of our New York life . Emma and John arrived together , chaperoned by one of the grander Apgar female connections . I came alone , not expecting to remain much after the poetry and the tea . But when warned that I might not stay for dinner , Mr. Marie was insistent . " You will find many of your literary confreres , awaiting you with such eagerness ! Or as Racine would say . . . " And he said something that Racine had indeed written and in an accent that Racine might almost have understood . Surprisingly , the master of " tong " was not present , nor was his Mystic Rose . Since most of the non-literary guests were exactly the same set that I have met night after night , I asked Denise Sanford why the Sovereign had stayed away . " Because the other one 's here , " said Denise . " The real one . And he 's here too . " Then she presented me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit younger than I , Mr. Astor looks not at all like hisp137grandfather . He is slow but agreeable , and much too red in the face . Mrs. J.J. Astor is from South Carolina , and droll . " Every day we follow your career , Mr. Schuyler . In the newspaper press . We were particularly delighted by your daughter 's engagement because it will keep her here and we need all the grace and beauty we can get . Of course , my husband and I have been longing to meet you but there was no way . " " Nothing could be simpler , Mrs. Astor  --  " " Nothing could be more difficult , Mr. Schuyler . In New York , it 's first come first serve . And Lina "  --  the family diminutive for the awesome Caroline Schermerhorn Astor !  --  " got you first . So we must just wait our turn . " I found her delightful , and rather wish we had not been taken so quickly and so firmly in hand by McAllister , since the other Astor house seems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I spoke to Stedman and his wife ; to the Gilders ( manly sister as well as girlish wife ) . I met Bayard Taylor , a large professional sort of writer ; his verses for the evening were most charming and won the first prize . My own doggerel was read aloud by Mr. Marie , stresses in all the wrong places . Nevertheless , the companyapplauded . Bryant came for tea and then departed . As America 's highestpaidpoet , he did not write anything for the occasion . I do n't blame him . For me the pleasantest part of the evening was sitting beside Denise on a wide Turkish leather cushion . Small , rosy , quick to comprehend everything , I like her easily the best of our new acquaintances . " How do you find hotel life alone ? " I asked . " It is like heaven ! " Obviously no grief for the departed husband . " No servants to worry about , no menus to prepare , no invitations to send out . I simply lie in bed all day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow fall in the park . And wait for Emma 's visits . " " Which are daily , I gather . " " Would that they were ! We are addicted to one another . She does me more good than any of the doctors . Her imitation yesterdavof the Mystic Rose made me laugh so much that my doctor was furious with her , since I am not to be overstimulated . " I wanted to ask just what it is that is wrong with her but didp138not dare , nor has Emma been very enlightening other than to say that Denise suffers from an unnamed feminine complaint of no great seriousness . " I do n't know what I shall do without Emma . And you . " She treats me like a favourite uncle and I feel old , but then I am old and better to be a favourite uncle than no relation at all . " When you go South you 'll come through Washington , wo n't you ? " Denise shook her head . " If I go South , Bill 's boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor says , is what I need . I must say I do hate sea air . I 'm sure it 's most unhealthy . Look at the natives who live all year round at Newport , Rhode Island . They 're forever ill . That is , if they have n't died in childbirth . " " The men , too , or just the babies and their mothers ? " Denise 's laugh is loud and unaffected . " I do n't think my conversationis quite up to Mr. Marie 's high standards . But children are on my poor muddled mind . You see , I ca n't have a child . " " Do you really want one ? " " Oh , yes ! That 's the whole point , is n't it ? " " I 'm glad that Emma was born , but that was just luck . Most parents are as little fond of their children as their children are of them . " " That 's your evil old Europe . " " I was thinking of the Vanderbilts . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt . " Anyway I am not to have children , it seems . In fact , should I ever try again , I am very apt to die . " This was matter-of-fact . " Do you believe the doctors ? " " I believe my own past experiences and they have been absolutelydreadful . " She shuddered ; then realized the impropriety of such a subject even between old uncle and favourite niece . " Besides , " she said , " I have been assured of my fatal flaw by a leading authority and friend of yours . " " Who can that be ? " " Why , Madame Restell . Bill told me he saw you there the other night , with silly young Bennett . " I was startled . Does Sanford tell his wife everything ? About the cigar stores , too ? " I thought husbands did n't tell their wives about their visits to Madame Restell . " " I think it 's the other way round . " Denise was sharp but amused . " Bill tells me whenever he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . "  | " You have deeply shocked an old man . " I moved away from her in mock horror , and almost fell off our leather cushion . " Oh , dear ! " Denise gave me a dazzling smile and a soft arm to steady myself with . " Well , it 's not as bad as it sounds . You see , Madame is really a very good doctor  --  " " With a degree ? " " Who knows ? Who cares ? What 's important is that she has spent her life doing her peculiar job very well and many ladies like myself go to her . " " In order to be able to give rather than to prevent birth ? " " In my case , yes . " Denise frowned . " She 's a kind woman , and very direct . I am not to be enceinte ever again . Those are her orders . " " Is this such a burden ? " I was , I suppose , shockingly intimate . " Obviously not to my husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit as blunt . " Anyway I am used to the idea of not having children . In a way , it is a blessing . I have fewer means of boring others . " She laughed , and so did I. One of our ongoing jokes is the way that the fine New York lady only comes to life ( relatively speaking ) when she has got the subject round to her litter . Curious , come to think of it , the detached manner in which Denise discusses her most intimate problems . I can not tell if she is as detached and as cool as she seems . I suspect that she possesses naturally and to perfection that histrionic gift her husband so entirely lacks despite constant practice . " I have , really , the best time of any one I know . I have my friends old and "  --  she tapped my arm  --  " new . I have a thousand interests , and even if I did n't , being responsible for the building and furnishing of 362 Fifth Avenue is a life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter . I accepted a glass . " I only worry sometimes about Bill . He does not use himself in the right way . " " You would have him in an office downtown making even more money ? " " Oh , no ! There 's quite enough of that going on without Bill joining the wolf pack . Besides , we have more than we need . It 's just that I wish he would really do something . Take advantage of our -- of his place . " " Boats , hunting ... " " Not enough for a clever man . And he is clever . I know that Vou think him stupid ...  | " How do you know that ? " I stupidly answered , unprepared for the charge . " I mean , I do n't think him at all stupid , " I stammered ; and spilled champagne . The tremor that comes and goes is confined only to the right hand . What does that mean ? " Oh , you do ! I can tell . So does Emma . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many intelligent people in his life . Neither have I , " she added quickly . " But I think I 'm more at ease with those cleverer than I. Certainly , I want to be in their company as much as possible , while Bill is shy , feels that he must pretend to be whatever he thinks the other person wants him to be  --  usually a railroad magnate . I shudder for him sometimes . Particularly when he is with you or Emma . " " But we like him . Not , " I added firmly , " as much as we like you . " " I did want you to say that ! " The girl beamed at me . " I feel that I 've known the two of you all my life . Would that I had ! This "  --  Denise glanced at Mr. Marie 's charming fussy rooms filled with tame writers and painters as well as with quite untamemagnates and their wives  --  " is really the very best that we can do . And it is not chez Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paris , too . " " Not like here where there are no courteurs ? Is there such a word ? " " There is now . You 've invented it ! " " Well , I shall want you and Emma all summer at Newport , Rhode Island , and the days will pass like minutes as we enjoy our courteurs . " " But Mr. Sanford . . . ? " " I hope . . . I think he will enter politics . " " Good God ! " " I 'm one of the few ladies who do not pretend to mind having Senator Conkling as a dinner partner . " " I should 've thought that that huge beautiful creature would be in great demand . " " Not with the likes of us who want nothing from Washington . And , of course , the poor goose is so very vain . " " And you would want your husband to be like Mr. Conkling ? " " In his own way , yes . It 's not the fashion , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he ? Why should any of us ? After all , we buy the senators who buy the elections . Even so , I think Bill is well suited for that life . And it would give him an interest . "  | " Would you like to live at Washington ? " " Heavens , no ! I should be like Mrs. Conkling and cultivate my garden the way she does hers in  --  where is it ? Utica ! " Emma and I both agreed that we are sorry , all in all , to be leaving New York . " But then Washington will be an adventure . " Emma is in enormouslygood spirits . " For me certainly . " I have not told her how much I dread the work that I must do . Daily I receive memoranda from Jamie . Lists of people I must meet , as well as keys to the locks of innumerable cupboards containing political skeletons . Fortunately , I am caught up in all my other work . The truly dreadful piece on the Emperor 's death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the House of Savoy is in Godkin 's hands at The Nation . The campaign biography of Governor Tilden waits upon his nomination : Mr. Dutton was firm about that . Meanwhile , Bigelow and Green have set **26;3522;TOOLONG work , assembling the raw material for a book . I have also had several unsatisfactory meetings with a lecture agent who insists upon reminding me at regular intervals that I am not Mark Twain . I tell him that this pleases me more than not , but subtlety is lost on him . He thinks that I can do well on the lecture circuit if I stick to the dresses and hair styles of the Empress and her court . When I finally balked at this , loftily told him , " You should really book not me , not a political writer , not an historian , but my daughter the Princess d'Agrigente . " The little man was all afire . " Would she do it ? I can get her twelve thousand dollars for thirty nights . " Emma was much amused . " If worse comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . Poor Papa , you work too hard . " Just now , as I was writing in this book , Emma came in to say good night . She kissed my cheek , as always . I kissed her hand . " October , " she whispered . " Not June . John 's agreed . " " Good , " I whispered back ; we are like two conspirators . Now that she stands poised at the edge of Apgar-land , I want her with me as long as possible . To the end , I nearly wrote ; have written.  |p142SHORTLY  AFTER DAWN the hotel 's carriage took us across town to the North River and then down to the Cortland Street ferry , where we embarked for Jersey City and the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot . During the ferry trip , we stayed in our carriage and watched through misty windows the shoreline of New York City become miniature . " I used to live just there . See ? That big building . Near the wharf . " The building was  --  and still is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a girl long dead . It is odd , in a way , that Emma should know almost nothing of my life before I met her mother . When she was young , she used to be curious about America but I told her so many made-up stories about Indians and suchlike that she took them for a kind of truth , and to this day regards my life during the twenties and thirties as , literally , fabulous . She also was brought up to regard me as something of an exotic . Early on , Princess Mathilde dubbed me the Blond Indian , and the name stuck . Most impressed , Emma would tell her school friends that her father was an authentic American Indian , from a fair-haired tribe.  |p143The  cars for Washington were luxurious ; and we left on time . I was not prepared , however , for the amount of commerce that goes on . First , one is tempted by a doughnut salesman . Then a small boy appears with a large pile of magazines and cheap novels as well as bags of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' magazine onto Emma 's lap and a novel about the Wild West onto mine . Then he disappeared . " Is this a present ? " Emma was astonished . " I doubt it . " When the cars pulled out of the station , we were still in possession of our unpaid-for reading matter . Meanwhile we were tempted by a fried-oyster salesman in a white coat ; only a stern look from Emma kept me from devouring my favourite food , the only American dish that in France I used to dream of and could never find a cook able to approximate that marvellous mixture of Atlantic sea-taste and old lard . The car was more comfortable than any European car , with curtains of green plush , stuffed chairs that turn this way and that , gas lamps in good cut glass , mahogany wood fittings , and , allpervading , the smell of burning fuel mixed with that of fried oysters . After a leisurely lunch in the restaurant car , we returned to find the young book salesman standing beside our seats . One hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extended to be paid . " That 'll be one dollar and two bits , sir , for the two . " The subsequent battle was finally joined by the conductor , who gave the young entrepreneur a sudden kick in the shins just as I was giving him " two bits " for what he had , finally , minimally , insisted was " an out-and-out rental of my publications . " With a cry of pain and triumph , he was gone . " They always get on the cars , sir . " The conductor spoke as of dust , flies . " There 's nothing we can do . " As the locomotives were being changed at Baltimore we got off the car and strolled along the siding . Suddenly I heard a sound above me . I looked up and saw a dozen tramps at their ease on top of our car . Aware of my gaze , one of them swung down onto the siding with a monkey 's agility . " Ma'am . " He approached Emma who was nearest him . Leering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you give a hit for a poor old veteran ? " Before either of us could respond , a second and a third and ap144fourth tramp joined their colleague . Grimacing and grasping and hideous with soot from the locomotive , they formed a menacing circle about us . I raised my stick , and Emma screamed . In a moment two armed railroad guards appeared on the run from the nearby depot , and the tramps disappeared amongst the cars and warehouses . This most alarming experience was made even more alarming by the conductor , who said matter-of-factly , " Nothing you can do about ' em . Soon as we 're out of the depot , they 'll hop right back on again . And if you 're fool enough to get anywheres near them , why , they 'll throw you right off the train . " Interesting and sinister note : as far as I could tell , not one of the tramps was an immigrant . All looked to be of the old Americanstock , wounded or debauched or both in the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have dreamed that there would be such a vast floating criminal class in this country , or so much grinding poverty in grisly contrast to the awful richness of the sort of people we have been seeing at New York . I pity Tilden . For all his intelligence and ambition , I doubt if he has the capacityor the will to do anything about those sooty figures which like monsters in a nightmare suddenly appear and re-appear when least expected , to remind us of the pit . Emma is still shaken , and so am I.We arrived at Washington City in the late afternoon of what appeared , unexpectedly , to be a spring day . Though it is midFebruary , the south wind was warm and languorous and the gardens and vacant lots were bright with premature spring flowers , with daffodil , narcissus , hyacinth . In front of the Pennsylvania Station there was a long line of dilapidated hackney cabs , each in the charge of a Negro driver . Since I have always had difficulty understanding Southerners , it was Emma who finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why have you never told me about this city ? It is a city , is n't it ? " We had just entered Pennsylvania Avenue and Emma was looking about her with absolute curiosity , and some surprise . " I was only here once . For two days in 1836 . So I do n't remembermuch except that there was not much to remember . Now at least they 've put up a city . "  | " Where ? " " To our left and right . A great world capital . " I waved grandiloquentlyat the boarding houses and bars , restaurants and hotelsthat line Pennsylvania Avenue , only recently paved , the driver told us , with asphalt . The dingy red-brick and white frame buildings to our left and right look even smaller than they are because of the enormous width of the avenue that extends from the Capitol to the White House  --  or used to . Since my last visit the direction of the avenue has been changed ; it now goes in a straight line from the Capitol to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for a block or two when it turns to the left , dividing in half the original front lawn of the White House . The section of lawn separated from the White House by this new extension of Pennsylvania Avenue is now known as Lafayette Park , at whose center stands not a statue of Lafayette  --  that would be too logical  --  but one of Andrew Jackson , astride his horse . I was pleased to see that the Capitol is at last finished . " It used to have a very disagreeable-looking temporary dome . . . brown , I think it was . " " A good building . " Emma gave the Capitol her imprimatur . " But there is nothing really to go with it , is there ? " She indicated Pennsylvania Avenue . " I mean , this wo n't do at all . " We were now at Sixth Street , just opposite the Metropolitan Hotel , a somewhat seedy revision of the famous old Indian Queen Hotel , where I once stayed in the high heat of a Washington summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sumptuous dinner at Andrew Jackson 's White House , my one and only visit to that center of so many of our countrymen 's dreams . " And look at all the black people ! " " The Negroes have always been a majority here . Certainly , they do all the work . " " We are in Africa ! And it 's marvellous . But why did no one warn us ? " I suspect that Emma is more right than she knows , for WashingtonCity is a curiously tropical , colonial-seeming place . Certainly , one senses a native life going on beneath the surface quite separate from that of the white visitors  --  a category which includesnot only the transient members of the government but those native whites who are proudly known as Antiques -- andp146bear the same relation to the political transients as those old New Yorkers who live below Madison Square bear to the flashy folk who live above . Willard 's Hotel occupies the corner where Pennsylvania Avenueturns right at the Treasury , a neoclassical building that put Emma in mind of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Willard 's Hotel is a six-storey building . Rather plain on the outside , the interior is elaborately decorated in that quaint American version of our Second Empire decor which many find vulgar , though , personally , I rather like the crowded , gilded , Gothic glitter of so many American houses and public places . As we stepped beneath the marquee , amiable if not eager black servants came forward to collect our baggage . At the entrance of the main lobby stood the manager , a younger version of Ward McAllister . " Welcome to the nation 's capital , Princess . Mr. Schuyler . " He bowed low . We murmured our delight at being guests of the hotel . Like a parade , we were led across the darkly frescoed main lobby , carefully avoiding in our solemn progress a thousand bronze spittoons . " Your friends are already here , Princess . Waiting for you in the rotunda . " This was said as I registered us ( only ten dollars a day for a two-bedroom suite with three meals apiece ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what the manager had said . In fact , Emma was too busy looking at everything and everyone while I was reading a message from Charles Nordhoff , the Washingtoncorrespondent of the Herald : if we are not too tired , he would like to take us to dinner this evening . The manager then led us not to our suite but to a large receptionroom , with a great dome supported by gilded columns . On the tessellated floor , numerous sofas and chairs contain what look to be politicians with their constituents : in their way , as alarming and dangerous-looking a group as the tramps at the Baltimore depot . Directly beneath the dome stood a tall , formidable full-bosomedlady . " She 's here ! " The manager exclaimed to the lady . " I mean they 're here . Mr. Schuyler and the Princess , your friends ! " Emma and I stopped in front of this complete stranger , who inclined her head with all the dignity of the Mystic Rose . " I , " she proclaimed in a voice that echoed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news to impart , " am Mrs. Fayette Snead . " The manager left us to the Sybil 's mercies . " I do n't believe that we have had the honour . . . " I began . Emma simply stared , as though at the zoo . " You doubtless know me as Fay . ' " The accent was deeply Southern but altogether too easily understood , for each syllable was boomed with equal emphasis . " As Fay ' ? " I repeated stupidly . " That is the name I write under . For the Washington Evening Star . This is my daughter . " A slightly larger version of " Fay " advanced upon us through the menagerie of politicians and constituents ( who paid us no attention , thank Heaven , political chicanerytaking precedence over mere theatre ) . " You doubtless know her by the pen name Miss Grundy . In real life she is Miss AugustineSnead . She also writes regularly for the Evening Star . Now , if you will come this way . " Obediently , blindly , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotunda where I could see , through swinging doors , the blessed accoutrements of a bar room . " You may imbibe , Mr. Schuyler , " said Mrs. Snead . " I am tolerant through tolerance , like all the Sneads . The darkey yonder will serve us . You , Princess , will want tea . " " Yes , yes . " Emma eagerly agreed as we sat in a circle close to the bar room , from which the waiter brought me a mint julep ( an excellent cocktail that McAllister often praises but never produces ) and tea for the three ladies . " Most European royalty stay at Wormley 's Hotel . Why have n't you , Princess ? " asked Miss Augustine Snead , a sly-looking young woman with a squint . " I wish to be a real American like my father , " said Emma . " Willard 's is more democratic . " This went down well enough . " We shall be very curious to know , in due course , your impressionsof Washington , Princess , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Schuyler , " said Miss Augustine Snead . Then trot her and daughter each produced a small notebook and proceeded to interview us . They were very thorough . We went through our paces with some panache , particularly Emma , who has , finally , got the range of our newspapers and will now give to the boldest , baldest wav the most astonishing invented-on-the/spot receipts for inedible dishes , not to mention arcane processes for the maintenance of youth and beauty . " Once a week , Mrs. Snead , I wash my hair in kerosene . " Emma 's eyes were aglow , and I had to look away for fear of laughing . " Kerosene ? " Mrs. Fayette Snead 's pencil paused . " Kerosene , Mother ! " Miss Augustine Snead knew a rare story when it came her way . " Yes , we 've heard they do that in Paris . " " It was the Empress herself who made the discovery first . " Emma 's voice was hushed . " I myself find that within one hour of the washing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must try it . Not , " said Emma quickly , aware of the rather thin lustreless heads of hair opposite her , " that you are in any need ... " " Oh , yes , we are . " Miss Augustine Snead was firm . " Fact , Mother 's going a bit bald on the top if the whole truth were known . " " Let us try then to contain the whole truth , Gussy dear . " Mrs. Fayette fairly beamed her displeasure . Then , to Emma : " But is there not , Princess , some danger of conflagration should one draw too close , let us say , to a lamp ? " " No , not at all . At least not during the one hour when you must sit absolutely still with your head held as far back as it will go so that the loosened hairs can freely breathe . " Other subjects were handled by Emma with the smoothness of a professional lecturer . I 'm not at all sure that she ought not to go out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would without conscience despatch her to thirty cities , with myself as personal manager and advertisement concocter . The ladies knew of Emma 's engagement . " Wo n't you miss not being a Princess any more ? " asked sly Miss Augustine . For the first time , Emma was irritated . But she concealed it from the ladies . " There is no European title , Miss Snead , that is finer than that of the simple American Missis . " " Hear , hear ! " I said gravely , swallowing the last of my mint julep . A few moments later we were in our suite , roaring with laughter . The thought of the Sneads , mother and daughter , with hair aflame like so many wigs of Nessus did us both a world of good . Bathed and rested ( one must , alas , go down the hall to the bathroom  --  the appointments here are not in a class with thosep149of the Fifth Avenue Hotel , but then neither , thank God , is the price ) , we met Charles Nordhoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first I was somewhat intimidated by this stern Prussian-born man of forty whose profession it is to write about Washington politics for the Herald . I feared that he would regard me , rightly , as a presumptuous dilettante , a celebrated writer from outside sent by a frivolous publisher to take precedence over him for at least twelve weeks . Our first encounter at the reception desk in the lobby was not encouraging . Nordhoff is a thick-set man with what I believe is known as a " nautical swagger " ; at least , he walks with a peculiar lurching gait , memorial to his many years at sea . Like my old friend Leggett of the Post , Nordhoff 's career began at sea : first with our navy , then aboard various sailing vessels . He is the author of a once-popular book that I have not read called Nine Years a Sailor . Nordhoff worked for Bryant at the Post until he was sacked because  --  everyone but Bryant says  --  of his attacks on the Tweed Ring ( must ask him the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herald . Last year Nordhoff found time to write a most interesting book which I have read called CommunisticSocieties of the United States . This subject proved to be our bond . Nordhoff clicked his heels for Emma , bowed low and kissed her hand . Warned by me of his German background , she spoke softly to him in German . Surprised and pleased , he answered . Then he took my hand , gave me a long thorough look and said , " Paris Under the Communards is the best and most serious work I have yet read on communism , published in any language . " I do believe I blushed . Certainly I felt giddy with this unexpectedpraise , so much so that I did not for once mind that he had , like everyone else , got the title wrong . I have always had bad luck with titles . I should , obviously , imitate the masters and be terse , stark , memorable . Madame Bovary , Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Bleak House : no mistaking those titles once seen or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordhoff said , " You should meet Mr. Roose . He knows everything . If you 'll forgive us , " he said to Emma , who smiled forgiveness . Nordhoff then led me in to a small tobacconist 's shop just to the right of the front door as you enter . Here were sold not onlycigars , cigarettes and plugs of chewing tobacco , but newspapersand periodicals from all over the country . Mr. Roose is a dignified , almost senatorial figure ; solemnly he welcomed me top150Washington as he gave Nordhoff an envelope ( he runs a sort of post office , too ) . " Our special telegraph office is right there , should you be needing it , Mr. Schuyler . " And sure enough , in the next room , there was indeed that modern convenience , courtesy of Western Union . Mr. Roose also promised to reserve for me each day a copy of " our " paper , the New York Herald . A long line of hackney cabs is permanently stationed in front of the hotel but Nordhoff suggested that if Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not far from here , and there 's a sidewalk most of the way . " Emma was game . " It is Africa ! " she whispered to me in French as we made our way along the uneven brick sidewalk , where scores of blacks sat comfortably as though at home . Some drank , some played at dice , others made mournful music on homemade pipes whilst overall , in the distance , floating like a dream carved in whitest soap , was the Capitol , ringed by boarding houses . Although the sun was gone , the evening was unnaturally balmy . The traffic in the broad avenue had almost ceased except for the streetcars that continued to rattle back and forth . As we turned the corner just opposite the Treasury Building , Nordhoff showed us a tall elm tree named for the painter-inventor Morse . Apparently some awesome thought like gravity occurred to him in its shade . " How lovely , " said Emma . Nordhoff made a curious barking sound , which I now recognizeis his way of laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city is that it was worse until five years ago when we got our own Boss Tweed , a local criminal who is stealing the city blind but paving the streets in the process . " " Does no one complain ? " " About the paving ? Yes , he 's got the gradings all wrong , so that when it rains much of the city resembles Venice . " " I meant , complain about the stealing . " " Good God , no ! That 's the American way , after all . And improvementsare being made . Also , no matter how dreary Washingtonis , it is still the Heavenly City to most members of the Congress . Compared to where they come from , this is a place of wanton luxury and dazzling architecture . There 's the White House . " In the dark , through tall trees , the large white building looked like an abandoned box . " Charming , " said Emma . Since my lastp151visit a number of glass conservatories had been added to the White House ; they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worse , " said Nordhoff . Then he led us to FifteenthStreet and the restaurant , which is housed in an ordinary brick building about the size of a New York brownstone . How marvellous , by the way , to see nothing brown in this city save the Negroes . Most Washington houses are made of dark red brick , a colour that appeals to me but puts Emma in mind of dried blood . Nordhoff led us up the stairs to the main dining room , where a black maitre d'hotel showed us to a corner table . The room was pleasant , with crimson plush curtains and an old-fashioned Turkeyrug on the floor . The lighting came only from candles , a relief after New York 's ubiquitous calcium glare . Emma took her seat as if perfectly unaware of the interest the other diners showed in her . All round the dining room , mouths were forming small 0 's to make the word " who . " " I shall get a number of inquiries tomorrow . " Nordhoff was amused . " Everyone will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guest , " I said . " It is Emma they 're staring at . " " Are they all senators ? " Emma 's gaze travelled swiftly about the room , as though at the theatre or viewing a diorama . " Senators are upstairs , Madame la Princesse . In small dining rooms , with bottles of wine and long cigars ... " " And ladies ? " " Sometimes . But usually senators prefer to dine with other senators and plot ways of emptying the Treasury . " " Flow exciting ! Then these people are . . . ? " She indicated our fellow diners . " Lobbyists . They only meet the senators in dark alleys , where money changes hands . " " It would seem , " said Emma , " that the government here is simply the giving and taking of money . " " Amen ! " shouted Nordhoff , startling the next table . Then he proceeded , " at Jamie 's expense , of course , " to order us a splendid meal ( again terrapin ; also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was admirable . I could very easily like Washington if I did not have to writeabout it . Nordhoff has been kind enough to give me his notes onthe Babcock affair , and I now have the makings of my first piece , which will be a general physical impression of the city after fortyp152years ' absence , with assorted ruminations on corruption , the Whisky Ring and O.E. Babcock . " You 'd better meet Bristow , the secretary of the treasury . He 's the one who 's destroying Grant . " " His own president ? " Emma is surprisingly interested in politics . I am beginning to wonder if I did not make a mistake . For years I always took Emma with me to the Princess Mathilde at Saint-Gratien , where all was art , when she might have been much happier at a political salon or even at the Tuileries , trying to make conversation with the poor Emperor , who was so entirely political , so much of a political genius , in fact , that he was , necessarily , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak candidly to anyone of anything that mattered . Happily , Emma did have one year as lady-in-waiting to the Empress and , I suppose , heard some political talk . Unlike Napoleon III , the Empress could talk of nothing else ; she , too , was a politician but a bad one and because of her we ( " we " or " they " ? " We " ! That is or was my country ) went to war with Prussia and lost our lovely world . Note : the incorruptible Benjamin H. Bristow of Kentucky becamesecretary of the treasury in June of 1874 . To everyone 's surprise he turned out to be an honest man . When he discovered that the Treasury Department was manned by thieves , he cleared them out as best he could . The so-called Whisky Ring began in 1870 , when Grant appointedan old crony named General ( naturally ) John McDonald as chief of the Revenue Office in St. Louis . Like Babcock , McDonaldserved with Grant at Vicksburg , and whoever served with the great commander during that celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mint . In any case. , the tax on whisky in the West did not go to the government but to McDonaldand his cronies , as well as to Babcock and , perhaps , to the President himself . To date some ten million dollars have been stolen . " Is the President involved ? " I am deeply curious . Nordhoff shrugged . " I suspect that he is . Certainly , he 's been warned often enough about Babcock , and certainly , he is doing everything possible to stop the investigation . " " But it is normal to try to protect your administration . " Emma was practical . " So the Stalwarts say . Anyway , the trial goes forward in St. Louis , and Grant has said that he is willing to testify in person on behalf of Babcock. "  | " That sounds like an honest , stupid man , " said Emma . " Or a sly guilty one , " said Nordhoff . " Anyway , the Cabinet has talked him out of going to St. Louis . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting most eerily the range of these monsters . She has already confessed to preferring Africa to Apgar-land . " What makes me think that Grant is guilty has been the behaviorof the Attorney General . First , the U.S. attorney prosecuting the Ring was discharged . Then just before Babcock went on trial , the Attorney General ruled that the government may not obtain evidence by promising immunity or leniency to any of the witnesses . Well , that of course has stopped the prosecution cold . " " And Grant knew of this order ? " " Grant himself gave the order , to save Babcock . " " And himself ? " Emma was fascinated . " Obviously . Well , we 'll soon know the verdict . The trial should end this week . " " You think that Babcock will get off ? " Nordhoff nodded . " But not the others . They will go to jail . " " Why is everyone so afraid of the President ? " My question must have sounded more nave than it really was , for Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But he 's not as powerful as the Congress . Or the courts . He can be impeached easily enough . Look what they did a few years ago to President Johnson , who had committed no crime of any sort . " Nordhoff put the matter for me in a different way . " Most of us here have a fair idea that Grant has been involved in a good many shady deals . But we can not , must not , say so . " " Libel ? " All things African absorb and delight Emma . " No . Because Grant is the country 's hero and the people simplycannot , will not accept that he is corrupt . I suspect a majority may secretly think that he is . They certainly know about his family and his close friends . But he is still Ulysses S. Grant who saved the Union , the greatest living general in the world  --  a brave and silent hero , ever so silent , who gives the impression that he knows nothing of politics  --  " " While knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor . " " My daughter should write these reflective pieces . " Emma laughed . " I do n't think  --  " But at that point she was interrupted by no other than the Speaker of the I louse of Repre/sentatives ( that is , Speaker until last November 's Democratic victory ) James G. Blaine of Maine , Conkling 's only serious rival for the Republican nomination for the presidency . Emma and I are in disagreement . I feel more force in Conkling , as well as antipathy , than I do in Blaine . She is quite the reverse . " Mr. Blaine is superb ! A marvellous actor . . . like Coquelin playing at an American president-to-be . " " But he is nowhere near as beautiful as Mr. Conkling . And surely you are the first to respond to male beauty . " " But male beauty is , above all , male . Mr. Blaine positively overwhelms with those black Indian eyes . " " You have yet to see an Indian except for your blond Indian father . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchanted with Mr. Blaine . Compared to him , your Mr. Conkling is a provincial repertory jeune premier . " The great man had been on his way upstairs for a supper party with some friends when , as he put it , " I saw my very old friend Nordhoff entertaining what looked to me to be the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen , so here I am . Yes , I will sit with you for just a moment . Yes , waiter , I 'll have some of the wine . To drink the health of the beautiful Princess from Far-Away , and yours , too , Mr. Schuyler . " Apparently he , too , read in school my Machiavelli and the Last Signori . If I had known thirty years ago that I was educating a generation of American politicians , I might have taken more pains to point a moral or two . I think they have understood my Machiavelli too well , and missed the point to certain of the signori . Blaine was already full of drink but not drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is ruddy ; the small eyes are like polished onyxes  --  they look out at you so brightly that you can not look into them . The ears are elephantine , and often paler or rosier than the rest of the face  --  do they respond to his moods first or last ? The nose is somewhat potato-shaped but , all in all , the face ( what one can see of it above the clipped General Grant beard ) is pleasing enough , as is the voice , prime requisite for a national politician nowadays ( yet everyone tells me that the late revered President Lincoln had a weak , high , unappealing voice ) . " My wife will call on you tomorrow , Princess . " " Not too early , please . We are just off the cars . "  | " I shall see that she applies every hour on the hour until you can receive her . Besides , it is no great distance for her . We live just down Fifteenth Street , down the road , as we say here . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't give me the credit . It 's Mr. Schuyler and Mr. Bennett . " Rather to my annoyance , Nordhoff told Blaine what I was doing in Washington , and immediately Blaine became guarded , and though no less charming , the wine that he had allowed to make him glow was suddenly banished from that sharp mind . " Well , I ca n't wait to see what you make of our city . " " Have you anything to tell him about General Babcock , Mr. Speaker ? " Nordhoff surrounded this bland question with those little honks that are his laughter . Comically , Blaine looked to heaven . " I am devoted to the Presidentand to every man of our Grand Old Party ... " " Except Roscoe Conkling . " " There is a place in my heart even for that turkey gobbler . " Blaine finished off the wine in his glass ; then rose , as did Nordhoff and I ( the whole room was now more or less openly watching us , and trying to eavesdrop ) . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're just a bunch of poor country boys come to the big wicked city . " " I 'll remember that , sir . " " Princess , you shall , I hope , honour our house soon with yourpresence . " In a gracious flurry the great man was gone . Nordhoff waspleased with himself and with us . " I knew he 'd be here tonight , and I figured he would do exactly what he did . " " And if he had n't ? " Emma was challenging . " Why , I 'd 've sent a waiter to the private dining room and asked him to come down . " " You like him ? " I asked . " It is quite impossible not to , " said Nordhoff . " And is he also corrupt ? " I inquired . " Oh , Papa ! Do n't you know the answer by now ? " Nordhoff first barked , very sharply ; then said , " Yes , but with considerable style . I think he 's the most interesting man here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it , for Emma and I were both exhausted  --  was taken up with protocol . It is usual for a lady new to this city to remain in her residence and wait for those ladies of her own rank to pay her calls  --  usually ,  |p156no  more than the ritual leaving of a card . Nordhoff thought that Emma , as a Most Eminent Highness , would be called upon by the ladies of the Cabinet and the wives of the various foreign ministers . The question is what to do about Mrs. Grant . Nordhoff has promised to investigate and let us know whether or not Emma should call first upon her or wait and take her chances . Our hotel suite is nowhere near as comfortable as the Fifth Avenue Hotel but we are both too tired tonight to care . I noted , ominously , mosquito netting about the beds but Emma noted , with some relief , wire netting at the windows . She fell into her bed with the faintest of good nights . I forced myself to stay awake long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is ahead . HAVE FINALLY SENT off my first piece for the Herald , with a goodIdeal of help from Nordhoff , who continues to be of a perfect kindness . The President has also made a considerable contribution to my debut as a Washington observer , for yesterday his personal deposition to the court at St. Louis was published . Grant 's long , rambling defence of Babcock is regarded here with the deepest embarrassment by the Administration and with absolutejoy by the opposition . At inordinate length the President  --  presumably under oath  --  says over and over again , " I always had great confidence in his integrity . . . I have never learned anything that would shake that confidence ; of course I know of this trial that is progressing . " The President knows a great deal more than he deposes . For one thing , according to Nordhoff , Grant has taken at least one gift from the Whisky Ring . Two years ago the ringleader General McDonald gave him a pair of full-blooded horses with a side-bar buggy and gold-mounted harnessings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President a written receipt for $t , 7o0 . This is one of ' the ways our leadersp157grow rich . But then Grant feels ill-served by the Union he saved and often remarks upon all the money and property another grateful nation bestowed on Marlborough and Wellington for their victories . Bitter at obtaining not so much as a Blenheim Palace , Grant now thinks it only fair that he take anything offeredhim , regardless of the source . I sent my piece by the early morning car to New York ; and have just now received a telegram from Jamie , delivered by Mr. Roose himself . " Well done " is the verdict . So now I move with more confidence through the Washington scene , this gorgeous Africa , where Emma blooms and glows . But I am not at all certain what effect my pieces will have on our social life . At Nordhoff 's urging , Emma yesterday paid her call on Mrs. Grant , who was most dignified , although she is , according to Emma , like a rich farmer 's wife with hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy Washington and that we shall be invited to her next large dinner . She emphasized the word large . ' " " If the President has read what I 've written about him , we may not be allowed in the house . " " But you were tact itself . " Emma had gone over every line . We had both agreed that my reflections would have more force if I were to describe these circles of corruption in a flat straightforwardstyle , rather like that of a cookbook . I think , immodestly perhaps , that the result is quite interesting ; certainly , it is unlike the evangelical style of most American journalists , who proclaim their partisanship in such a shrill way that even when they are telling the truth they sound false or , worse , paid for . Emma 's success has been considerable . Mrs. Hamilton Fish herself paid a call . As wife of the Secretary of State , she leads the polite society here . She is also a New York grande dame , and related in a complicated way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Mrs. Fish left her card , the other ladies of the Cabinet did the same . In fact , the young and beautiful Mrs. WilliamW . Belknap paid her call in person because , it seems , she had met Emma four years ago in Paris . Mr. Belknap is the secretary of war and was originally married to Mrs. Belknap 's sister . When that lady died , he married the fascinating Puss , as Mrs. Belknap is known even to those who have not met her . Emma recalls her as something of a show-off at Paris . " Very gamine , but amusing in the Western style . " In any case , we have been taken up by the fabled Puss , andp158tonight attended a dinner at her house in G Street . Incidentally , Emma often remarks upon the smallness of the houses of the great . " It is a capital city in miniature . " " But of a very large country . " " All the stranger , then , that they should live in such small , cluttered , airless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these celebratedrulers of your great country do not often bathe . And the men never seem to have those frock coats and trousers of theirs properly cleaned . " I must say that I , too , have noticed the rather heavy odour that permeates crowded Washington gatherings . The ladies are of course drenched in French perfumes while some but not all of the men are partial to eau de Cologne . Soap , however , has no magic for the majority . I noticed that the fingernailsof Blaine were black , while the portion of neck visible above Nordhoff 's immaculate collar was delicately lined with grey , rather like Leonardo 's silverpoint crosshatching . Puss Belknap , however , smells like a lilac garden ; and most of the ladies at dinner tonight were good to look at if somewhatcountrified . The house has been packed with French furniture , and Mrs. Belknap is very pleased with the result . Emma flatteredjnow , shamelessly ; never betrayed how , as she put it 1 " none of it looks right in those rooms . But what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses well . " Emma 's highest compliment . The Secretary of War is a short , barrel-chested man with a full , curly auburn beard and a most sympathetic manner . " I hear you 've been writing about poor Orville . I do n't dare ask what you 've written . " I was not prepared for the swift confrontation . " Nothing too unpleasant . I 've just tried to make some sense of what 's been happening . The case is so difficult legally . " " Orville 's greedy . " The second time I 've heard that adjective used to describe the President 's secretary . " But a charming fellow . You 'll like him . Fact , he lives next door to us . " " Do you think he 'll be acquitted ? " " Well , you 'd better ask the Attorney General about that . " And there at my side was that high officer of state , Mr. G. H. Williams . But Mr. Williams ( or General Williams as the Attorney General is entitled ) was not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case , sir , that is at present in the courts . " " I was  --  ah , most interested in your ruling that the court mightp159not extend leniency to witnesses who were willing to ... " " Sir , that is a weapon of the prosecution that I have never favoured . It smacks of blackmail , of bribes . " " True . True . But then when you dismissed the prosecuting attorney . . . . " I tried to lead him on , but Williams is nothing if not shrewd . " Mr. Henderson was dismissed because of his partisanship . He was not interested in prosecuting the so-called Whisky Ring . He was interested in stopping the President from being elected to a third term by blackening the reputation of his private secretary . Sordid politics , sir . Most sordid . " " I tell you who I blame it all on . " Puss Belknap swept me away from the Attorney General . " I blame it on Mr. Bristow . Ever since that man became secretary of the treasury , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , General Grant is a saint , what he has had to put up with from that dreadful man , always talkin ' about reform just like he was . . . like he was Carl Schurz ! " She said the worst name that she could think of ( Mr. Schurz is a German-born journalist and reformer ) . " Or Governor Tilden . " " Oh , I hear he 's a terrible drunk , and even worse things , too ! I f you know what I mean . " But I did not know , and Puss is much too much the Kentucky belle ever to speak out on unladylike subjects . " Now I 've got a real treat for you , Mr. Schuyler . I have invited , just for you , the most popular novelist in the whole country , this little lady standin ' in front of you lives right here and has been livin ' right here in Washington her whole life long . She is our very own and very special literary lioness , Mrs. Southworth ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain of face and lugubrious of manner . Yet Puss is right , for Mrs. Southworth may well be the most popular novelist in the country . She is certainly the richest , as Bonner publishes everything she writes I n the Ledger . A year or two ago the public was offered  --  and snapped up  --  a complete set of her works in forty-two volumes ! I know because I saw all forty-two in Mrs. Belknap 's drawing room , each personally autographed . " I 've been following your work in the Ledger . " Mrs. Southworthwas both gracious and condescending , as is proper for a queen of fiction in the presence of a mere political observer . " You are too kind . "  | " You have not , I believe , Mr. Schuyler , written fiction ? " " I hope not . " I was sprightly . " I am mostly an historian . " " Your descriptions of the immoral court of the French Empressmade me think that you have , perhaps , the gift to move with your imagination the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , be it the stately palace or the humble cottage . " " You do me too much credit . . . " But Mrs. Southworth had other fish to fry , as they say in these parts . " Please present me to your daughter . I am at present writing about a noblewoman of the Continent , and I should like so much to ask her a few ques-tions . " " Emma will be thrilled . " I made the presentation , to Emma 's dismay , not to mention that of the Attorney General , who was making an impression on her quite as good as the bad one he had made on me . I then met a very solemn congressman named , most happily , Clymer . He is a committee chairman and so a local colossus . " I was Mr. Belknap 's roommate at Princeton , " he allowed . " I do think the world of him . " But I was not interested in our charming host . I was still on the Babcock trail . Mr. Clymer , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that General Grant has sometimes too much loyalty to his old army friends . " " I do wonder just how much the President understands what is going on about him . " " Well , he 's not a fool . No matter what they may think up there in New York . " " But why would he protect Babcock , who is plainly guilty ? " " I think , sir , we must wait upon the court . " I was put severely in my place . Rather angrily , I counterattacked . " I do have some firsthand knowledge of the President 's foreign appointments . I know Mr. Schenck . " Actually I have only seen Mr. Schenck at a distance , shortly after he was appointed minister to the Court of St. James 's . But I wanted to draw out the congressman ; and did .

" Mr. Clymer did not , I believe , get the point . Then we went in to dinner , where I sat on Puss 's left .

Finally , Mrs. Grant showed pity and asked her to dinner . On my other side was , alas , Mrs. Southworth , who told me the plot of her new novel , which is " set in a foreign European countrywhere there are alps and numerous chalets . Your daughter was most helpful . But now tell me , truly , what was it that transpiredbetween you and my old friend Mrs. Fayette Snead , known to faithful readers of the Evening Star as Fay ? " " Transpired ? Why , she interviewed us . That 's all . As did her ( laughter . We were charmed . " In due course , each lady had writtenher piece ( for different issues of the Star ) , and the tone was no different from what such writers always strike : a thousand adjectives , few verbs , and a great many feeble puns of the sort that Washington people are addicted to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Princess . And I will give you a hint : it has something to do with hair . " I was filled with remorse , even alarm . " Why , has there been an accident ? " Mrs. Southworth was pleased with her cunning . " Yes , Mr. Schuyler , at the Princess 's behest , Mrs. Fayette Snead washed her not exactly luxuriant hair in kerosene and  --  " " Caught fire ? " No . Worse , if possible . ller hair fell out , Mr. Schuyler . "  | " Great heavens ! But  --  but what sort of kerosene did she use ? " I improvised swiftly . " She did , she says , exactly as the Princess instructed her . " " But the Princess said French kerosene , which is so much lighter than  --  Oh , but surely Mrs. Fayette Snead did not use ordinary American kerosene ? " " I fear that she did . A misunderstanding . . . ? " " Absolutely . Oh , we must write her . Send her flowers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I can not think how she misunderstood . Emma was so specific . " I think I patched things up . If not , the vengeance in the press of Mrs. Fayette Snead known as Fay will doubtless be a terrible one . Emma thinks she may not sleep tonight for laughing . I note with some interest that my pulse in this city is normal and that I can sleep without laudanum . Obviously Africa agrees with us both . I WAS WORKING in the small parlour of our suite when Nordhoff was announced . Emma is out for the day with Puss Belknap , seeing the sights . Nordhoff showed me a cable from St. Louis : Babcock has been acquitted . " Are you surprised ? " I asked . " I suppose not . " Gloomily , he sank into a rocking chair , a curious piece of furniture for a hotel room , but then Willard 's is a curious hotel , combining luxury and grandeur with a smalltownatmosphere . Under the hotel there is something called a drugstore which not only sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in an original concoction known as " nectar cream soda " ( cold soda water flavoured with peach or almondp163extracts ) . If you are known to the attendants they will also place bets for you on horse races . Great city and small town exist side by side beneath the roof of Willard 's Hotel . " I hear that you 've been to the Belknaps ' home . " " Yes . It seems that Emma knew the delightful Puss in Paris , a charming girl . And he 's rather less tiresome than the usual politi-cian . " " Good , I guess . The fact that you 've got to know them . " I did not at first notice the significance of this remark . " Emma 's out driving with her now . " " I wonder if Mrs. Belknap knows . " " Knows what ? " " That the axe is about to fall on her pretty neck . " " For what ? " " Like her late sister , Puss has been in the business of selling post traderships at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have become to the way of life here , I was not prepared to include amongst the thousand and one high-placed criminals such a charming girl . Obviously I am a sentimentalist . " What , " I asked , " is a post tradership ? " " The exclusive right to maintain a store at a military post . ' There 's a good deal of money to be made . Years ago the beautiful Puss 's even more beautiful sister obtained for a Mr. Marsh the tradership at Fort Sill in the Indian Territory . Now , there was already a trader on the post and he , quite naturally , did n't want to leave , but an order from the Secretary of War is absolute . Fortunately for the incumbent , Mr. Marsh is a kindly man . He allowed the original trader to stay where he was on condition that he pay Mr. Marsh twelve thousand dollars a year . The trader thought this a fair arrangement . So did the Belknaps , who are paid each year half of Mr. Marsh 's twelve thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy all that French furniture , a l l those gowns from Paris . " " Well , " was the best that I could do . " I sent the story to the Herald last night . " " What will happen ? " " A congressional committee has already got most of the evidence . They 're now about to call Marsh to testify . " " Will he tell the truth ? " " I think he has no choice . "  | " What happens to the Secretary of War ? " " He will probably go to jail . " Nordhoff was grimly pleased that at least one of the villains will be made to suffer . " Tragic , really . " I was inadequate . " That poor girl ! " " That clever girl ! Except , of course , she finally got caught . Youdo n't seem happy about it , Schuyler . Has she entranced you , too ? " " No , not really . But I do wonder what I 'd have done in her place  --  or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that , more and more , I ask myself as I penetrate deeper and deeper into this moral Africa . " I would not . " Nordhoff was the complete Prussian . " I might . " I was honest . " Because I am weak , the way they are . And it is the custom of the countr " You and I , Schuyler , must try to change , if not the country , its customs . " As the day was pleasant and springlike , I strolled with Nordhoffto what is known as Newspaper Row , a stretch of sidewalk just off Pennsylvania Avenue in Fourteenth Street , where the Washington journalists and their friends sit on folding chairs beneath tall shady trees whilst copy boys hurry back and forth with slips or proofsheets . Here members of the Congress , eager for publicity , pay court to the press , and Negro waiters from a nearby barroom pass to and fro serving mint juleps and shooing away the cows that sometimes get loose and wander along the sidewalks , sensibly avoiding that mortal enemy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other journalists . He is much respected , as he should be . They treat me amicably but not seriously . They are not book-reading men ; and the sort of journalismthat I do impresses them not at all . Besides , in a few weeks , I shall be gone . They can afford to be tolerant . " Mark Twain used to sit here all day long when he was writingThe Gilded Age , " said Nordhoff , ordering cold soda water for both of us . " All the while telling us how it just was n't possible to writeabout this place . " " As he proved . " I found The Gilded Age entirely unsatisfying : a half-dozen good jokes embedded in a Mrs. Southworth plot . I prefer De Forest 's novel Honest John Vane , which deals with much the same material and in a sharper way . But no one I have met has even heard of the book , except Nordhoff ; he admires Dc Forest , too.  |p165Needless  to say , most of the talk along the Row was of Babcock'sacquittal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything that he writes . Although each is obviously inhibited by the prejudices of the proprietor of the newspaper he works for , I have the impression that given perfect freedom to write what he knows , he would still manage somehow not to be interesting or truthful if only because he is too much involved with the politicians he writes about . I think I met half the Congress this afternoon ; and a good number of these men of state were not so secretly spreading about the money they themselvesget from the lobby in order to hire as concocters of personaladvertisements the residents of the Row . Everyone appears to have his price . I heard a dozen good Babcock stories . The man 's greed is legendary . When the Whisky Ring sent him a diamond stickpin worth several thousand dollars , he found a tiny flaw in it and demanded as replacement an even larger , purer stone ; and got it . He is expected back at the White House tomorrow , and Grant is expected to keep him on as private secretary . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  most of it confused . Nordhoff ( who has got the march on all the other journalists ) pretended to know nothing . " Mr. Schuyler ! " I heard a voice that I should have recognized but did not , for it was in the wrong place . I turned . Striding toward me was John Day Apgar . I left Nordhoff and met John at the beginning of the Row . " I came down to do some legal work for the Days  --  my uncle , you remember him , do n't you ? At the New Year 's party ? " I did not but said that I did . The Days are a merchant family who have lived in Washington since the days of President Monroe . " Real Antiques , as they say here . " John was dutifully proud . " I 've also seen Mrs. Fish , who is a cousin of Hiram Apgar'swife . She says they 're planning to give a dinner for you and Emma very soon . " " That 's most kind of them . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Emma answered with one of her own . John and I walked back to Willard 's . " This will be a nice surprise for Emma . You did n't warn her , did you ? " " No . I wanted it to be a surprise . " A surprise it was . Emma gave a fine impression of joy at thep166news when she came back for tea , to find me hard at work in our parlour . " John wants to take us to Chamberlain 's for dinner . " This is the most distinguished of the city 's restaurants , more like a club than a restaurant , for Mr. Chamberlain only allows those who please him to gamble as well as dine in the mansion that was until recently the British legation , far out on a country road grandly known as Connecticut Avenue . Emma said that she would be delighted . Then she poured us both tea and announced rather than asked , " You know about Puss , do n't you ? " " Nordhoff told me something , yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " She confided in you ? " " She had to talk to someone , and I 'm an outsider , which helps . And another woman , which helps , too . Besides , it will be no secret tomorrow . She told me the press has got the story . " " Is she innocent ? " Emma was thoughtful . Then : " Let us say , she is contradictory . She blames everything on a Mrs. Marsh , the wife of the man who is supposed to have divided the money with her . She and Mrs. Marsh used to be close friends . They even went to Europe together . But then I suspect that Puss became a little too grand for her old friend , and was resented . Anyway , the Marshes are in town . He is going to testify tomorrow , I think , before a congressionalcommittee . Mrs. Marsh insists that he tell the truth , while Puss has begged him to deny everything . " " So she admits to her guilt . " " She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misunderstanding . That she had no idea what arrangements her dead sister had made with the Marshes , and so on . " " But she has been taking the money ? " Emma nodded . " Yes , I should say that she has . And Marsh is going to testify that he has been paying off the Belknaps for some years , at the rate of six thousand dollars a year . Not very much , is it , Papa ? " " For us  --  now -- a fortune . " " But for the Secretary of War ? " " No . It 's striking , really , the smallness of the sums these people will take . " " I suspect they find it simpler and less dangerous to take a greatp167many small bribes rather than an occasional large one . " Emma , as usual , managed to hit upon the obvious , which had , as usual , not occurred to me . If the Belknaps are now known to have sold one post tradership , then they have probably sold a dozen others that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving , Emma , in the best circles . No doubt of that . " But Emma did not laugh . " I do n't think I really understand your people , Papa . Why is it so wrong to take money in this way ? Who is hurt ? " " The original trader at Fort Sill is hurt  --  " " Nonsense ! He is making a fortune . And he probably paid a bribe to get the position in the first place . And then all this fuss over the gifts that General Grant receives  --  " " It 's not the gifts . It 's what he does in exchange for them . Like trying , just now  --  successfully  --  to obstruct the course of justice in St. Louis . Babcock has been acquitted because Grant removed the prosecutor in the middle of the trial and then refused to grant leniency to the prosecution 's witnesses and then , to top it off , lied under oath to the court . The country 's First Magistrate is a crimi-nal . " " But in Europe everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are Protestants and believe in sin and in retribution and in the absolute necessity of being good . " " I shall never be an American . " Emma was firm . " Then let us hope you manage to make John a Frenchman . " " I 'll have no choice , will I ? " For an instant we were on the verge of a dangerous candour . But neither could face that prospect ; and so we prepared ourselves for dinner . I quite like John and I think Emma does , too . But it is really all wrong , this bringingtogether of two entirely different cultures . Well , Emma will triumph at whatever she decides to do . I have perfect faith in the power of her will , and in the subtlety of her mind . There is nothing that she will not do in order to prevail . She is , in her way , a Bonaparte . Mr. John Chamberlain greeted us warmly . He did not appear to recollect John specifically but the name Apgar did have reverberationsfor him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and daughter , are local celebrities . We were assigned to the most elegant of the dining rooms : a rat her dark room , made sombre with that black walnut panellingp168which so appeals to my countrymen and so puts me in mind of funerals . John was full of news from Apgar-land . Emma glowed with what looked to be interest . " Your first piece for the Herald was well received , Mr. Schuyler . Even Father thought it was sound , though of course he 'll hear no ill of the Republican party . " " Then I suggest that like Odysseus he seal his ears , for presentlywe will be in Sirenland , and the Republican barque is headed for the rocks . " " Oh , " was the only response to this fine aria . " Have you been to the White House yet ? " John was curious to see how Emma would respond to American grandeur . But she was demure . " Only to pay a call on Mrs. Grant . We are , she said , to be invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Unless , of course , Papa offends the President with his pieces . " " Then you 've not seen the President , Mr. Schuyler ? " " Oh , I 've seen him , yes , but I 've not met him . " I should have noted earlier in these pages that two days ago , at about ten o'clock in the evening the President appeared in the rotunda of Willard 's Hotel . I had been warned that he often likes to stroll over from the White House to sit in the lobby and smoke a cigar , to speak to no one , and then go home . The hotel people respect his incognito , if that 's the word . But sometimes he is recognized by the guests , as he was by Nordhoff and me . Nordhoff saw him first . We were seated at the far end of the rotunda , going over my second piece . " Here he comes . Do n't stare . " I glanced casually toward the main door and there stood GeneralGrant . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say the least , a vivid-looking man . For one thing he is a good deal smaller than I had expected , and though , ostensibly , robust of build , he seems curiously fragile because of the way he moves : the upper part of the body inclines forward as he walks , while the head is held slightly to one side . I would suspect that he is pigeon-toed , with one leg shorter than the other like my mother , whose gait resembled his . The hair is short , turning grey , and parted on the left side ( it is said that he has a violent prejudice against men who part their hair in the middle ) . The famous beard is neatly tended and covers , or rather masks , the entire lower part of the face . Clenched between his teeth was a long black cigar that remained unlit for the whole time he sat in the lobby : he chewedp169rather than smoked . Just back of his chair stood the sole detective who guards the President on his strolls . Ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in repose is very curious . There is something hurt , damaged , puzzled in the expression . " Does he always look so wretched ? " I asked . " Pretty much . He laughs little , smiles less . And for an army man he is most prudish . He 'll walk out of the room if someone tells a dirty story  --  " " But he drinks , does n't he ? " " He used to . Certainly before and even during the war he was often drunk . But now I think he 's rather abstinent . Most of his time is spent with horses . In fact , he will only talk to you about horses or the war . He gets upset at any mention of politics . " " Quite understandable . " " He has no interest in the arts . He actively dislikes music . Yet he is partial , curiously enough , to flowers . " " Men are not easy to fathom , are they ? " " Heroes least of all . " So we stared for half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ease , chewed his cigar , looked at the people coming and going like any other war veteran come home to grow ( ) Id , to sit on the courthouse steps of an evening and watch others live . Finally , the President was recognized . Two political types ( of the lobby , not the Congress : I 've got so I can tell them apart with a glance ) emerged from the barroom and , rather drunkenly , presentedthemselves for Grant 's attention . The hero 's face did not ounce lose its puzzled expression while the blue eyes did not , to say the least , invite any intimacy with the strangers . As Grant got to his feet one of the men seized his hand . The President allowed the hand to be held for an instant . Then he piilled it  --  and himself  --  away . The two men suddenly were faced not with the President but with the tall detective who had placed hI , large presence between them and the retreating small figure . In an instant the scene was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious . " No . But limited . Without much curiosity . Yet he has come to knew a good deal more about government than most people suspect . But he has  --  obviously  --  no gift for presiding over this country . " I laughed , at the odd way Nordhoff expressed himself , like ap170translation from the German . " Who could govern such a place ? " " Tilden , I think . " " Not Blaine ? " " Too corrupt . " " Conkling ? " " Too proud , too unyielding . " " Is there anyone else ? " " A hundred candidates , but none of any distinction . I have a personal fondness for Congressman Garfield . He is a scholar . A cultivated man . But weak in character . Like almost all of the Congress , he took money from the Credit Mobilier , that company which owned the Union Pacific Railroad . " General ( of course ) James Garfield is a member of the House of Representatives from Ohio . He is relatively ungreedy , since " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . I believe he called it a dividend against some stock that may never have existed . By the way , I saw him this morning and he said that he would like to meet you . " " For three hundred and twenty-nine dollars , tell him that I shall be his creature , and concoct advertisements for him . " But Nordhoff has not much lightness when the subject is his subject , the politics of the United States . Garfield is a classicist . Simultaneously , he can write Greek with one hand and Latin with the other  --  the result must be dreadful ; he belongs to Washington'smost intellectual literary club ; he particularly admires the works of Washington Irving and wants to meet me , largely , I suspect , because he knows that I go back to that era . I do n't know why , but any hour spent with any Apgar seems to contain not the sixty precious passing minutes that old men are supposed to cherish but more like ninety minutes of marking rather than living time . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Day family ; and perhaps take tea with Mrs. Fish . I shall attend the hearing of the House Committee on Expenditures in the War Department , and listen to what Mr. Marsh has to say.  |p171Nordhoff  introduced me to Congressman General Garfieldin the huge gloomy rotunda of the Capitol where squalidbooths have been set up by enterprising businessmen to sell visitors everything from food to patriotic knickknacks . I must say that I was pleasantly impressed by the goldenbearded , blue-eyed Garfield . He is about six feet tall and not , astonishingly , too fat , considering his age ( forty-five ? ) and position in the world . " Now that we have met , Mr. Schuyler , I hope that you will do us t he honour of coming to the house . . . " The usual formula was coffered and responded to . Meanwhile Garfield was shepherding Nordhoff and me down a frescoed corridor , through jostling crowds of congressmen , lobbyists , mere citizens . Finally , we stopped at the door to that committee room which , for several hours today , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside the door sergeants-at-arms were pushing members of the newspaper press back . " We 're full up , gentlemen . Full up ! " Hut after-a whispered word from Congressman Garfield , NordoRDHOFFINTRODUCED ME to Congressman General Garfield in the huge gloomy rotunda of the Capitol where squalidp172hoff and I were able to slip into the crowded committee room and squeeze places for ourselves just back of a row of fashionable ladies , all jammed together on narrow benches . At a long table sat the members of the committee , chaired , to my astonishment , by Representative Clymer . I whispered to Nordhoff how I had met Clymer at the Belknaps ' house . Nordhoffwas fascinated . " He actually told you he was Belknap 's roommateat Princeton ? " " Yes . And his oldest friend . " Nordhoff whistled . " They must 've been trying to fix somethingat that dinner party because Clymer has known about Marsh for weeks . " All in all , the human drama that unfolded seemed even more unreal to me than , say , Oakey Hall 's play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members ) deported themselves like the very worst sort of actors trying to look like Roman senatorswhilst sounding like country Jonathans . The hero  --  or heroine  --  of the day proved to be Mrs. Marsh , a good-looking woman , who wept noisily , stared boldly at members of the committee , allowed them glimpses of her ankles as , deliberately , she crossed and re-crossed them during her husband'stestimony . I think Mr. Marsh made a good impression on the committee , for he sounded like a man telling the whole truth , and thereby delivering a death sentence upon the Belknaps . He even describeda recent evening with that desperate couple ; told how Mrs. Belknap had asked him to perjure himself , but he would not , could not , had not . All through this recital I watched Mr. Clymer . " Pained " best describes his expression . Not once did he address a question of any importance to the witness . On the other hand , Mr. Clymer made no effort to save his friend . He simply sat there and listened as the Belknaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other day-to-day journalists hurried to the Capitol telegraph office to send the story out on the wires . Left to my own devices , I spent a bemused hour observing the Senate and the House of Representatives . The two chambers have recently been renovated , and the old red hangings and tobacco-stained rugs have been replaced by a delicate grey decor with hints here and there of imperial gilt . Although there is lessp173spitting of tobacco nowadays , there are quite as many spittoons in the two chambers as in the old days . At one point I found myself actually on the floor of the Senate without having had to undergo the tedium of the electoral process . I had seen a crowd of lobbyists hurrying through frostedglassswinging doors into a long narrow chamber . Out of curiosityI followed them . At first I had no idea what this dim , peculiarly shaped room was . Against one sombre wall black leather sofas alternated with black walnut writing desks . In the opposite wall several swinging doors opened onto what , I soon realized , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a declaiming voice could be heard but not , happily , understood . Senators wandered back and forth from chamber to cloakroom , as the room where I was is known . But the cloakroom is not exclusively for senators . I found it crowded with the men of the lobby as well as with journalists and , here and there , a citizen or two . All in all , I was somewhat amazed at the lack of formality , considering the awesome self-esteem of the American senator . But then , torn between maintaining a proud reserve suitable to one who has been elected to the highest legislature of the greatest nation the world has ever known and doing business with lobbyists , the practical tribune of the people prefers making himself easily accessible to those who want to give him money . Today , of course , was a day like no other . The usual trafficking in favours had been replaced by speculations on the Belknap scandal and its possible ramifications . A journalist held enthralled a group of senators with a descriptionof Mr. Marsh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was plainly unable to record accurately ( journalism , not justice , ought to be portrayed blind , holding a loaded set of scales ) , I walked over to one of the swinging doors , hoping to get a glimpse of the Senate floor . Suddenly a senator pushed past me ; and sent me stumbling toward the high dais from which , constitutionally , the vice presidentpresides . Since that personage died some months ago , his Place is filled by various ranking senators . Today a large solemn man was in the chair , reading what looked to be a novel . So absorbed was he in his book that he did not once glance my way despite the noise of my entrance into politics . Fortunately , I was well sponsored , cradled as I promptly wasp174in the arms of Senator Roscoe Conkling . Whoever had pushed me through the swinging doors had done so just as Conkling was about to leave the floor ; and into his powerful arms I fell . I looked up at him ; he down at me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator ' Schuyler , you seem in a great hurry ! " " I was pushed , sir . And stumbled . I must thank you for catchingme . " " I had no choice . " By then we were not only standing apart but as I am prone to do with tall men , I was beginning to make that necessary distance between us which minimizes differences in height . Conkling was resplendent in a brocaded vest and white flannel trousers ( in February ! ) . " A rambunctious lot , our lobbyists . " " And much at home here , it would seem . " " Too much at home . " Conkling shook his head gravely , deploringwith that gesture the common corruption . " But now that you are a senator too , come look at your new home . " Conkling took my arm . I hesitated . " Is n't it forbidden ? " " Of course . Everything is forbidden . Otherwise there would be no pleasure . " With that he led me onto the Senate floor : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daylight from a skylight above reflected coolly off grey walls and hangings . In the press gallery I saw a few familiar faces . The public galleries , however , were nearly empty . Those few who had come to observe the democratic process seemed mostly to be simple country people who behaved  --  quite rightly  --  as if they were at the circus ; they chewed tobacco , shelled peanuts , ate popped corn , a newly contrived delicacy with the consistency and , I should think , the flavor of new paper currency . Perhaps a dozen senators were at their desks , reading newspapers , chewing tobacco , chatting with one another as a noblebrowedSoutherner made an impassioned speech whose subject was the continuing minatory presence of Federal troops in certainof the Southern states a decade after the end of what he did not call the Civil War . Conkling motioned for me to sit at an empty desk . He then sat at the desk just in front , graciously turning toward me the magnificenthead and torso . " You are now seated at the desk where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death with a cane . "  | " Which am I to anticipate ? His ghost or that of the cane ? " Conkling 's smile revealed dingy teeth . " Both are long since exorcized . A superior man , Sumner , but unbelievably arrogant . " Curious how we always detect ( and despise ) in others our own faults . " When someone told General Grant that Senator Sumner did not believe in the Bible , General Grant said , Only because he did not write it . ' " I laughed spontaneously , and with some surprise . " I had not thought General Grant a wit . " " Oh , he is a shrewd , quiet , odd little man , and today "  --  Conklingexhaled a long breath  --  " he has been murdered . " " By Mr. Marsh ? " Conkling nodded . " Any hope for a third term was just now butchered in that committee room . " He waved in the offending direction , like Edwin Forrest as Othello confronting Iago . " Were you at the hearing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some days what would be said , and done . " " Will Mr. Belknap be impeached ? " " I think that at least can be avoided . " " But is he  --  are they not plainly guilty ? I believe that over the years Mr. Marsh paid the Belknaps something like forty thousand dollars . " " Yes . " But the word was not an affirmation . Simply a form of punctuation . " So much is for sale , Mr. Schuyler . " " Apparently . I am told that to obtain a cadetship at West Point you must give your member of Congress five thousand dollars . " " I believe the price is higher if he is from New York . " Conkling looked both amused and bleak . " Senate seats are also expensive . My admirers are said to have spent a quarter of a million dollars to get me this plain chair and table . " He slapped the desk in front of him . I was taken aback , as he no doubt intended me to be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need money to be elected . " " Senators are chosen by state legislatures and the legislators of New York are spoiled men  --  as well as spoilsmen . " He laughed at his own play on words . I laughed , too , a bit weakly , not at all sure what he was trying to tell me . " Is the price too high then ? " I was tentative . " It is all money nowadays , Mr. Schuyler , and it is all too high . do relieve in my part v , though . " The look of sincerity in thosep176pale eyes was so perfectly convincing that I knew myself to be in the presence of a truly deceitful man . " I still believe in Grant , though God knows he makes it hard for us over here , with those war cronies of his ... " " Does he know they steal ? " Conkling again gave me his sudden charming if dingy-toothed smile . " Oh , Mr. Schuyler ! I know that you 'll put whatever I say into Jamie 's Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old Sam Tilden , who 'll use anything to beat us at the polls . Not that he 'll succeed , mind you . Not in the end . " " If that is the case , Senator , and if you are his opponent , the country will be in good hands no matter what the result of the canvass . " I was every bit as dishonest as Conkling , who then proceeded to startle me . " Spoken like a true minister to France , Mr. Schuyler . And may I say that if I should ever become the president , I 'd have more than half a mind to appoint you myself . " At that instant I could not think how in Heaven 's name my ambition was known to Roscoe Conkling , since only three people on this earth are aware of it and I can not imagine Emma , Bigelow or Tilden mentioning the matter to anyone . My response was , I hope , cool ; certainly not brilliant . " What little I do for the Governoris simply pro bono publico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French say . Why , when General Grant wanted to appoint me Chief Justice two years ago , I told him , privately , more or less the same thing . How it was in the public interest that I stay on here , doing what I can to help his Administration . " " And then , in due course , take his place , which is certainly more splendid than that of the late Chief Justice Chase . " I put in the knife without remorse . Conkling had taken me for a fool . Having somehow learned my ambition , he thought that by appearing to equal Tilden 's offer I would then keep silent about his affair with the daughter of the late Chief Justice Chase . Yet I can not imagine how I or anyone could make political use of this affair . Only the injured party , the mad little Senator Sprague , could make trouble . If he were to join forces with Blaine or Tilden in defeating his wife 's lover . . . I must take all this up with Bigelow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just then a sergeant-at-arms came over to say that some Senate busi/ness was about to be transacted and that strangers must vanish . We shook hands with every appearance of warmth . " I shall hope to see you soon , and the Princess , too , of course . " A few minutes ago I asked Emma if she had ever mentioned to anyone niy desire to be minister to France . " Never , Papa ! Not in this country of wolves  --  or I suppose , since we 're in Africa , it 's jackals . " But when I told her what Conkling had said , she looked suddenlyknowing , and somewhat abashed . " I have discussed it , Papa . I 'm sorry . I told Kate Sprague . " " My God ! " " It 's not that bad . " Emma was soothing ; kissed my cheek ( I have a slight fever this evening , and catarrh ) . " I mean , of course I should not have mentioned it to anyone , but Kate was in tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a fair exchange no robbery . " Emma had shifted to French . " She told me that Mr. Conkling would marry her if she could ever have her husband legally put away . I do n't know what the process is , but .. " " But there is still the very sane Mrs. Conkling , the gardener of Utica . " " Well , that was what I said , too , and Kate got quite confused  --  for her . She is always so clear and hard . She spoke of divorce and  --  " " And an end to the career of Mr. Conkling . " " So I thought , and I know nothing of such matters . Anyway , Kate must have told Mr. Conkling that she had been indiscreet . I 'm sorry . " I can not say that I like Conkling any better for his attempt to make me an ally or to disarm me but his fierce boldness is certainlymost presidential  --  no , most imperial  --  and so not a proper style for this time , place . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Apgar-ish , Confederate style . In fact , though their house is of brick , it looked suspiciously brown by the time the evening was over . Rather like the grand New Yorkers , the Days and their fellow Antiques seldom speak of politics , ignoring as much as possible hose transients , the politicians . But tonight even these authenticated  --  positivelysigned  --  Antiques are forced to admit that they were . intrigued by the Belknap scandal . They had known thep178first Mrs. Belknap ; thought the second Mrs. Belknap a trifle flashy ; deplored corruption , naturally . " There is really no one in this Administration you would want to know except poor Cousin Julia , and she just seems to ignore everything unpleasant . " Poor Cousin Julia is Mrs. Hamilton Fish , whose formal dinner in our honour has yet to materialize . " A wretched business , politics , " declared Mr. Day , a stout man with a patch over one eye that gave him the look of a pirate . " A business for the bent . " To which a six-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I want to be a senator ! " Much laughter ( this was before dinner ) ; the boy was duly removed from the parlour , which was a perfect re-creation of any one of the New York parlours of the Worthy Nine despite the African provenance . Mrs. Day 's appearance might be improved by a patch over one eye or perhaps both eyes , since she suffers , poor woman , from some sort of lurid eye infection ; she asked me the familiar question , " Why are n't you at Wormley 's ? It 's the only nice place , really . I always say that to stay at Willard 's is about as bad as staying in the Capitol itself for all the low types you see in the public rooms . " I begged expediency . Emma smiled and smiled . She looked radiant and smiled yet again when John proposed a toast in her honour ( I could not see the label on the wine but think it homemade : the source of tonight 's fever ? ) . " To my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he made the toast , and I rather like him . He does indeed love Emma , and there is a lot to be said for such a strong emotion , even in marriage . Then the ladies left the table , and John and I were entertained by ten gentlemen of Washington , Antiques to a man and entirely Southern in manner and accent , not to mention politics . " I would vote for a yellow dog if he was runnin ' as a Democrat , " said one , explaining not too flatteringly his support of Governor Tilden . Although politics does not much interest them , they are furious at Blaine , who recently made a speech on the necessity of denying civil rights to Jefferson Davis , the former president of the former Confederacy . As for the Republican party , they will abhor it " so long as a single Federal soldier stands with bayonet in hand before the capitol of any Southern state ! " boomed one Antique . It is curious that after ten years the late conflict is still so muchp179on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . The city is ringed by derelict forts , and all the flimsy , ugly buildings thrown up to house troops , the wounded , and government offices still temporarily stand . Then , too , the Days and their friends are Southerners , and Washington is the paradigm of a Southern city , African to the core , and a most peculiar place from which to conduct a war against the rest of the South . It is a wonder that Mr. Lincoln escaped assassination as long as he did . Yet I find it startling that , even now , Federal troops are still on duty in states like Louisiana , Florida and South Carolina . " I have been invited to Newport , Rhode Island , this summer , " said John as the others discussed real estate , the one subject that enthralls the true Antique , since a good many of them live by selling or renting houses to the despised political transients . " The Sanfords ? " " Yes . They  --  she said that you and Emma would be there in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Actually , I have not made up my mind . Although Emma and I would like to stay with Denise , neither of us is happy at the thought of playing audience day after day to William Sanford'sincorrigible performances . I would prefer to stay with Mrs. Astor , and visit Denise as much as possible . Unfortunately , despite hints , there has been no invitation from Mystic Rose or from loyal chamberlain . I told John that nothing was definite . " My parents are very nervous . " And John laughed very nervously . " They think Newport , Rhode Island , almost as terrible a place as Long Branch , where the President goes . " " What standards ! " I exclaimed . ( I am certain it was the wine : I am now feeling sick to my stomach and in need of a purge ) . When we joined the ladies , Mr. Day gave a number of samples of Antique wit , particularly calculated to thrill and titillate mixed company . " Why , " Mr. Day asked Emma , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , earn to what ? " Emma has not all our verbs at her command . " Ice-skate . You know , skate on ice . " " Ah , did the Devil wish to ice-skate ? " " No , no . Well , yes , I guess he must 've . But why did he never learn ? why could n't he learn to ice-skate ? " " I am baffled , " said Emma . " Because how in hell could he ! " Mr. I ) ay and the Antiquep180gentlemen laughed at what , I gather , is an old , even antique story , whilst the ladies clucked disapprovingly at the sly way profanity had been legitimately used in their presence . Emma simply smiled . Saint-Gratien seems a world away , and entirely lost . THE LAST FEW DAYS would have brought down any parliamenrygovernment . As it is , the Grant Administration is in a shambles , and there is even talk that the President might resign . Events are moving so rapidly that I have become a sort of writing machine into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous . But then he is writing every day , while I write , thank God , only once a week . On March I , Babcock resigned as the President 's private secretary . Ill-advised as ever , the President has just appointed his own son to take Babcock 's place . Apparently Grant wanted to retain Babcock , but Mr. Fish said that if he did he would then have to find himself a new Secretary of State . But Babcock will not want . The President has rewarded him with the superintendency of Washington 's public buildings where he can steal himself a secondfortune . Happily , Babcock is about to be indicted for the burglarization of that famous safe in St. Louis and there is still a chance of putting him in prison . Nordhoff is very grim these days ; also , very pleased . The Augeanstables of American politics may yet be cleansed once the public sees what condition they are in . Poor Tilden . He will have to play Hercules . On March 2 , Belknap resigned as secretary of war . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their version of what happened . It varies significantly from what Nordhoff thinks happened . Terrified at the thought of impeachment in the Ilouse and trialp181by the Senate , Belknap went to the White House on the morning of March 2 . With him was Secretary of the Interior Zachariah Chandler , a Michigan politician close to the President . This sequenceof events was supplied me by Nordhoff and seems plausible . According to General Grant 's defenders , the President had been so preoccupied with the Babcock affair that he had not been aware of the charges against Belknap ... Just writing these words makes me think that if Grant did not know of this business , then he is indeed the village idiot . I realize that there are those who would consign him to that category , but I am not one of them . No fool could ever command for any length of time a great army , much less defeat a resourceful and splendid enemy . But I must set down the story as Nordhoff tells it . Shortly before the arrival of Belknap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's nemesis ) interrupted General Grant at breakfast with the request that he receive at noon a certain New York congressman who would give the President full details of the Belknap scandal . General Grant agreed to meet the congressman . Query : Would n't Bristow have mentioned why the congressmanwanted to talk to the President ? And if he had , then the President must have known that Belknap was on the verge of impeachment . The question is crucial . Bristow departs . The President orders his carriage to take him to the studio of a painter who is doing his portrait . Just as General Grant is coming downstairs from the family living quarters , a messenger tells him that the Secretaries of War and Interior wish , urgently , to see him . They are in the Red Dining Room . The President goes to them . Belknap says that he wants to resign immediately as secretary of war ; he babbles incoherently . Chandler is direct , if not honest . He gives Grant the impression that Belknap must resign in order to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an illegal nature . Without returning to his office , Grant sends for his son Ulysses , and orders him to write out a letter accepting Belknap'sresignation ; then he tears up his son 's letter ( it is too cool in tone ) , and himself writes the letter of acceptance , and signs it . Excunt Belknap and Chandler . As the President is about to get into his carriage , enter two Republican senators who explain to him for the first ( ! ) time thep182Belknap affair . The senators are shocked . The President is shocked , and , I should think , alarmed , for by allowing Belknap to resign , Grant inadvertently ( the adverb used by his supporters ) made it impossible for Belknap to be impeached , because in the eyes of many constitutional authorities an official may not be impeached , much less convicted of a crime committed in office , when he no longer holds that office . After this disheartening news , General Grant went and sat for his portrait , and the artist later reported that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ordinarily suspicious Nordhoff tends to believe that Grant knew nothing of the Belknapscandal before the arrival of the two senators . It seems to me inconceivable that he would accept so quickly the resignation of an old friend on the grounds that , out of office , Belknap might be able to protect his wife  --  a perfect non sequitur , since a high official is always in a better position to thwart justice than the plain citizen . I think that General Grant understood perfectly what he was doing . But I think that even the most partisan of Democrats will prefer to believe that Grant did not understand the matter , for if he did , he is guilty of obstructing the course of justice and is as much a criminal as Belknap . Now for General and Puss Belknap besieged at 2022 G Street in their lovely home , as Mrs. Fayette Snead would say , crammed with French furniture ; no , not besieged  --  kept under guard in order to prevent them from escaping to Europe . We arrived at teatime , in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her . " May we go in ? " I asked the policeman . I was tentative , not certain of the protocol in these matters . " Suit yourself , " was that genial officer 's response . The scene in the downstairs parlour resembled a lying-in . Heavy curtains were drawn against the daylight . Large funereal candles stationed at strategic points created a dim but attractive setting for the room 's centerpiece , a blue velvet chaise longue , on which reclined Puss , swathed attractively in lace , features pale and interesting . On a papier-mache table at her side a glass of port stood next to smelling salts . The Negro servant showed us into the presence . " Bring them tea , " a tiny voice whispered from amidst the lace , " and tell the General our friends are here . Our only friends ! " The servant vanished just as the tears fell . I suspect that this dialogue andp183those tears have been often repeated these last few days . Dramatically , Puss held wide her arms to receive Emma , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tears to fall onto her shoulder . I stood awkwardly to one side , as men must do at such times , wishing I were elsewhere . But then tea came . Puss poured . Respectfully we sat around the bier and heard her version of what had happened . " It is beyond me how anybody on this earth could believe a word that Mr. Marsh said , much less the word of that  --  that woman he is married to , that viper I once like a perfect fool befriended ! Sugar ? Milk ? " We instructed her . Puss was now in full command of herself . Our tea was handed us without a tremor . " The truth is that my late sister , an angel if ever there was one loose on this terrible earth , did know the Marshes , and did have some kind of business dealin 's with them which I knew nothin ' about , bein ' unable to add two and two , much less able to do  --  what that awful woman got that stupid husband of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never paid you anything ? " " Of course he paid me what he owed us ! " The answer was swift . She has learned her part . " And I did , in my ignorance , use him to look after certain business affairs of my late sister 's and took his word for everything , since I have no head for such things , and should probably be hung for my stupidity , seem ' as how my poor husband has been forced to resign ... " " But Mr. Marsh said that he paid both you and your husband . " " It 's that awful Mr. Bristow ! Oh , I tell you this , Mr. Schuyler , before that man is through he is goin ' to drive General Grant himself from office . He 'll have the President of the United States , t he greatest hero of all time , in jail  --  " " For what ? " Although Puss 's rambling commentaries never exactly responded to any question asked , they were conducted for a definite purpose . " I shudder every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald , shudder when I read what your friend Mr. Nordhoff is writin ' about us as if we were criminals ! Did you know that they came here and arrested my husband because Mr. Nordhoff had said we were plannin ' to flee to Belgium , which has no extraditiontreaty with the U.S .... ? " " I do n't think Mr. Nordhoff intended to ... " " Well , it 's all craziness ! We 're not gain ' anywhere . As if we could ! ( Because after my poor husband was arrested and they letp184him come home , they put that policeman outside the house , and when I begged the man to at least come inside and sit in the vestibule , where he would be less visible , he just laughed in my face . I hope Mr. Nordhoff is satisfied . And I hope you at least will give the world our side , somethin ' nobody else will even dare to do . " That explained the invitation to tea . I must say my position is delicate . I can not contradict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ; also , in general , I think that he is right . Certainly , I am absolutely convinced of Puss 's guilt . But the mysterious figure in all this is Grant . I must meet him ; see him at close range . Yet I shall not be able to meet him if my next piece for the Herald describes my suspicion ... no , my conviction that the President is involved right " up to the handle , " as Sanford in the role of rough-hewn railroad man would say . Meanwhile , I 've solved the matter of this week 's piece . I shall simply describe in flat detail the committee hearings , the behaviour of Mr. Marsh as well as Mrs. Marsh ( this will please Puss ) , and allow the reader to make up his own mind as to the Belknaps ' criminality . We were joined by Belknap and a square-jawed , clean-shaven man of about my age , who proved to be the Secretary of the Interior , Zachariah ( or Zach. , as everyone calls him ) Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very cool , and very much in control . With a trembling voice , Belknap said , " Princess , Mr. Schuyler , you do n't know what this means to Puss and to me , your rallying around at this terrible moment in our country 's history . " I was much amazed that what was , after all , old-fashioned grand larceny should have so suddenly become a crisis in the affairs of a great nation . But then , I suppose , in a way , Belknap is right . As Conkling said , any hope of a third term for Grant has been butchered by the Belknap affair , and the prospects of Conklingor whomever the Republicans choose to run against Tilden will hardly be enhanced by these revelations . Then Belknap turned to Chandler . " You tell her , " he whispered , turning to face the empty fireplace , head down as if praying ; from the rear , he looked like a solid keg covered in black cloth . " Clymer has started the impeachment process . He spoke to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Puss was not performing now . She looked morep185drawn than ever , and very intelligent : fox in a trap , ready if necessary to gnaw off its own leg . Chandler was as soothing as he could be under the circumstances . " I must say it was a terrible strain on him , being such a good friend to you both . At one point , I thought he was going to break down . " " A pity that he did n't . What happens now ? " Puss looked to her husband , but the dark keg of a man was impassive . " There will be a trial , " said Chandler . " We ca n't avoid it now . But they have n't got the votes to convict us . " The " us " was very nice . " They 'll need two-thirds of the Senate which they have n't got . Besides , there are quite a few senators who 've already said that you ca n't impeach and convict a man no longer in office . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , on the coming election ? " I spoke in my role of solemn but friendly journalist . " It is quite possible that the Republican party will lose . " Zach . Chandler was matter-of-fact . The keg spun around . " And all on account of the damnable Marsh  --  forgive me , Princess  --  and that she-devil of a wife ! " " Evil is a constant in human affairs , " intoned Zach . Chandler . They were marvellous . The guilt had been transferred to the Marshes in order that that obscure couple would be held responsiblethrough all eternity not only for the end to Grant 's hope of a third term but for a possible end to sixteen golden years of Republican rule . I looked at Emma , afraid that she might burst out laughing , but she was as grave as any mourner . I felt a traitor in that room , for with every word Zach . Chandler spoke I saw with growing certainty  --  andjoy  --  the fact of a Tilden Administration . But Zach . Chandler thinks otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristow . " " Will your party nominate him ? " I ought not to have said " your , " but Chandler seemed not to notice ; treated me as one of t hem . " If they do , I 'll kill him ! I swear it ! " That from the blue velvetsofa . " He will have a difficult time . " Chandler was mild . " I do n't think the Stalwarts will take to a man who has covered General Grant in mud . " Belknap sat down in a chair opposite us . I felt truly sorry forp186him . He has taken money for favours given , but I can not regard him as a bad man . Rather , he is a victim of this place , and I mean not Emma 's delicious Africa , the national capital , but the country itself ; this vigorous , ugly , turbulent realm devoted to moneymakingby any means . Certainly , if true justice were meted out to one and all , impartially , most of the congressmen would be in prison while Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Grant himself  --  well , that is for me a deep mystery to which Belknap added when he said , " I told General Grant when I last saw him , after all this started , I said , What a long strange way we 've come , you and I , since Shiloh and Vicksburg , ' and he said , The end 's not yet in sight , ' whatever that may mean . " MIDNIGHT . Emma has gone to bed exhausted , and I must try to make some sense of our evening at the White House . The long-awaited invitation for the " large " dinner arrived , to honor the dean of the diplomatic corps , Baron Jacobi , the ministerfrom Bulgaria . Of a hundred guests perhaps half were diplomatsor visiting foreigners , a category to which the social aides at the White House have decided that Emma and I belong . " It should be interesting . " Nordhoff had joined me for a peachnectarcream soda in the drugstore beneath the hotel . " Keep a close eye on Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one 's wallet ? " Thus do we speak of our masters . " No . But she 's apt to be a bit shaken today . This afternoon she marched uninvited into a Cabinet meeting and , to the embarrassment of everyone , paid tearful tribute to the goodness of her friend Puss and the probity of General Belknap . " " I was not aware she was so politically minded . " " She 's not , as her appeal plainly demonstrates . Anyway , something was ventured but nothing was gained . The trial continues . "  |p187At  exactly seven o'clock the rented carriage containing Emma and me joined the long line of carriages in front of the White House portico , or " piazza , " as Mrs. Grant calls it . Emma was again in her Winterhalter Empress Elizabeth gown and the long gauzy train quite filled the back seat . We had both of us to strugglewith it to avoid smothering . " What do I call the President ? " Emma asked . " Mr. President , I should think , or perhaps General Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no ! None of that . Here we are all equal . " " It is a pretty house , " said Emma as we alighted . A Negro usher showed us into the entrance hall , where most of the guests were already gathered , a somewhat un-Washington assortment , thanks to the preponderance of foreigners . Baron Jacobi is a fine bright little man more fluent in French than English ; and he presented himself to Emma . " With delight ! I have been following you day by day in the press as you make your way through the gilded salons of the Capital , and I have been hoping , praying that one day we would meet . " Emma was charmed . The Baron is a bachelor , and as protocol does not obtain before the President 's arrival , the Baron took Emma in to the East Room . I followed , looking about for familiar faces ( Blaine was there , but not Conkling ; I bowed to Zach . Chandler and to General Garfield ) . I also looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the White House forty years ago . A single glance convinced me that nothing is as it was . The hand of Mrs. Grant can be seen in every room , and it is not a light hand . Where , before , everything was bright and airy ( if a bit dusty and run-down ) , now all is dark , rich , and thickly gilded . The East Room is unrecognizable in its new Galena , Illinois , Gothic style . Rows of squat wooden columns now break into three small areas what once had been a splendid large room . The wallpaper is dark with dim gold figures . The furniture is of ebony and gold . The effect is deeply sombre , even disturbing . I trust that Tilden will take an axe to the Grant additions . Of all the guests assembled in the East Room , the diplomats scented most at home , but then that is their minimal function . I was pleased that since Emma was on Baron Jacobi 's arm , everyone was eager to meet her . She looked most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , that child of yours . " Blaine was at my side  --  face red with wine , black eyes aglitter with reflected candlelight . Side by side , we stood in the doorway , surveying the room . " Well , French ladies do make the most of themselves . " I can not think why I was so stupid as to emphasize Emma 's foreignness , which of course can only throw in doubt my own Americanness . But I was distracted by the room , the people , the occasion , trying to absorb the experience in order to turn it into words , the writer'sglum task that forever keeps him at one remove from life . " Did my daughter call upon Mrs. Blaine ? " I had forgotten whether or not the ladies had done their duty . " Indeed she did . And they had tea , at an hour chosen deliberatelyso that I would be safely at the Capitol . I hope , on some other occasion , you 'll do us the honour . . . " Another invitation . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusuallybusy session of the Congress . " I did my duty as a journalist . " Busy ? Not me ! " Blaine laughed . " I 've never been lazier . When we Republicans lost our majority last fall , I said , Now I 'm out of jail . I do n't have to be the Speaker . ' " At some length he told me how much he enjoyed not being Speaker . " You ca n't imagine how dull it is up there , listening to all that bad oratory . But what have I said ? You wo n't quote me , will you ? I am at your mercy . " " Your secret is safe with me , sir . " Blaine gave me a curiously sly sort of smile . " Well , now . You might be able to quote me as saying that I find the oratory on the other side of the Capitol not quite so fascinating . Five minutes of Senator Conkling 's glorious voice and I am as one chained to Morpheus 's slow carriage and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams . " " That will go into my next piece for the Herald . " During all this , Blaine was constantly beaming , shaking hands , greeting one and all , as he talked to me . " I 'm glad you 're not as hard on us as Charlie Nordhoff . Now , he 's what I call something fierce . " " That 's because I 'm just the curious man from the outside , while Nordhoff is the furious man on the inside . " Nice , I thought to myself ( and duly record here for possible use later ) . " Ever since the Democrats won the House away from us , they 've been smelling blood . They 're on our trail . And Novemberthey 'll try their very best to get their hands on this fine oldp189house , too . " Expansively Blaine gestured , striking General Grant a light blow on the shoulder . Feeling his arm in contact with someone else , Blaine turned to apologize ; then his eyes went wide when he realized that it was the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the doorway , preparing to make their entrance . " My God ! I mean , my General . I did n't see you . " " Quite all right , Mr. Blaine . This season it is the custom to strike the President on sight . " Grant 's face did not lose its usual hurt puzzled expression , but the drollery was swift and engaging . As I anticipated , he is no fool . I was not prepared , however , for the quality of his voice , which is low and musical and not at all what one would expect in a military man . The late Prince d'Agrigente , marshal of France , had a voice like that of a whooping crane , and easily audible , I should have thought , from Moscow to St. Petersburg ( shrieking , " Retreat ! " ) . Side by side the Grants marched ( or , in his case , tottered ) toward one end of the East Room . We were then lined up to be presented . Behind the President stood some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were presented . I was gratified that Emma was the first lady to be presented , since little Baron Jacobi had no intention of letting her go and , as guest of honour , he took precedence . Lacking any rank , I was amongst the last to touch hands , for that is about all that either General or Mrs. Grant does . Close to , one finds that the General 's eyes are still alert , though the sharp clear blue of the early portraits has gone somewhat cloudy with age . The hair must have been a rust colour originally ; now it is mostly grey . A prominent wart to one side of the beard Is the last part of the face that one can see , for mouth and chin are entirely hidden by the famous neatly cropped beard . The President , I should mention , wore evening dress . I do n't know why , but I had expected him to be in full uniform , wearing a hundred bright medals . When my name was mentioned , I saw that he knew exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled as well ; it is hard to tell , since the mouth is hidden . He muttered something that I could not hear . I suspect it was " Good evening . " I moved on to Mrs. Grant . A small stout counterpart of her husband , Julia Dent ( ; rant is uncommonly plain , with eyes that look toward each other , giving her face a slightly crazed expres/sion , as if one eye could not fathom why the other eye was staring into it . The senior James Gordon Bennett 's eyes were equally crossed , but stared only toward Heaven . " I 've had the pleasure earlier of meeting your daughter , the Princess , Mr. Schuyler . " The voice was nasal and somewhat Southern ( she comes originally from Missouri ) ; the manner was easy . " You are too kind to invite us here . . . " I was polite , even apologetic , feeling something of a traitor in that room . " I also know that you have both been more than kind to my friends General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more loudly than was needful . I looked at the President . He had heard , and was not pleased . With the gesture of a rider transferringthe reins of a horse to a groom , he handed the guest he had just greeted over to Mrs. Grant , forcing me to move on . " You remember Colonel Claypoole , " said the President loudly , and I was swiftly succeeded by the Colonel , whom Mrs. Grant did remember . So much for my first encounter with the world 's most famous general . I must say , right off , that I found Grant less impressive than Andrew Jackson , whose hand I had also shaken in that same room . Yet I do detect some strange quality in Grant that is very deep . ( Yes , I recall that Hawthorne said of his old friend PresidentPierce that he was " deep , deep , deep " when of course Pierce was shallow , shallow , shallow ) . But where Jackson was entirely the splendid border aristocrat , visibly pleased with himself and his place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzling . For one thing , the hurt face is perfectly contradicted by the confident voice , by the swift intelligent gaze that simultaneously takes in and dismisses  --  reflective of a military genius that for some reasonhas not translated into politics as it ought to have done , for , contrary to legend , generals are almost by definition adept politicians . Presently we were led in to dinner . The state dining room reflects the taste of Mrs. Grant : nightmarishly rich , complicated , and dark . We sat at a huge horseshoe table . I was something like a mile below the salt . On my right I had the wife of a French diplomat ( an omen ? ) ; and on the other side Mrs. James Garfield . She bears the resonant name of Lucretia , and appears to be a woman of strong character ; she is pleasant-looking with auburn hair piledp191high on her head , contrary to the prevailing fashion . " I 've met the Princess already , " she confided , as the slow procession of huge platters of hammered gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , we were served twenty-five courses and six good wines . " She was at poor Puss Belknap 's house . " " Oh , yes . Emma told me , " I lied . It is curious how secretive Emma is . Although we talk , I think , with perfect frankness about everything and everyone , I am forever startled to discover that , unknown to me , she has dined with the Belmonts , say , or chatted with Lucretia Garfield at the Belknaps ' house . Emma finds it easy to keep a secret . I do n't . But then she is a secret , and I am not . " Naturally , I asked her if she knew poor Kate Sprague . " It would seem that all ladies are " poor " to proud Lucretia . " Yes , Emma sees her often at Paris . I 'm afraid I hardly know her . " " What a comedown in the world it must be for her . " Mrs. Garfield could not hide her pleasure , which was increased , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed such a taste for . She , too , is addicted to Maryland crab . " Even though it took me years to get up the nerve to eat one . I mean , they do n't grow them back in Ohio . " She ate a crab  --  shell , claws and all ; and kept on talking . " I used to be so jealous of Kate I could n't bear to be in the same room with her . " This confidence was most unusual . Jealousy is one emotion never admitted to by those who live on the political and social heights . " You see , General Garfield was a protege of her father , ( thief Justice Chase . We 're all from Ohio , you know , and of course it 's no secret that before my husband married me , he was out of his head for Kate , so pretty she was in those days , though General Garfield did tell me that he thought her nose a trifle pug . But I think he just said that to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington from Mr. Lincoln 's time rightup to the Panic , when she lost everything and had to move to Europe . " The pleasure in learning that others have lost money is apparently a universal one . Aaron Burr used to brighten visibly when he heard that yet another of the republic 's founders had gone bankrupt . " Not everything , " I was to the point . " She has acquired Senator Conkling. " phis took some wind from I , ucretia 's voluminous sails . But they soon filled again . " True . But I can not see what earthly goodp192it will do either of them . Rather the contrary , since each is mar-ried . " " Divorce ? " " She has grounds , I 'll say that , poor girl . And no one would mind . I mean Bill Sprague is mad as a hatter , and a drunk , and dangerous . But Mrs. Conkling is a perfect lady . " " Then come next January Mrs. Conkling will be in this room , doing the honours . " I gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the attention of each dinner partner simultaneously . " Oh , I 'm not so sure of that . " Lucretia Garfield refused claret , which I drank ( too much of , I fear ; my tremor has returned , but the low recurring fever of the last few days is gone ) . " I should say that Mrs. Blaine will be at the head of this table , poor woman . She has such a good mind . But six children ! I mean she has no peace . " " But Mr. Blaine is not , as far as I know , a general , and I thought the people only elect generals nowadays . " " Senator Conkling is n't a general either , and he 's the President'spersonal choice . " This is the first indication , if true , that Grant has a preference . " Not that General Grant will try to interfere , " Mrs. Garfield continued . " That 's not his way . But he 'd like to see Senator Conkling get the nomination . If Mr. Conkling does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for ever so many reasons , among them poor Kate  --  the President would like to see poor Mr. Fish as president , and he ca n't be nominated either . So it will have to be Mr. Blaine , or so my husband thinks , " she added , for the first time ceasing to be an expert in her own right and acknowledging her satelliteshipto Garfield 's sun . The wife of the French diplomat was more amused than amusing . Although entirely tactful , she managed to make fun of our great republic 's leaders ; and I confess that looking about the dining room , at the grim small President thoughtfully chewing a piece of charred beef ( the best thing I have heard about Grant is that he can not bear the sight of blood ; nor will he " eat anything that walks , " as he puts it , " on two legs , " removing poultry and the human race from his diet ) ; at the plump solemn officers of state got up in mouldy black ( Emma is quite right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen is oppressive ) ; at the overdressed preening ladies , looking like so many farmers ' wives in fancy dress , I could not help but agreep193that our social scene is seriously lacking in " tong . " But while I regard it as perfectly natural for me to make sharp comments , I find it peculiarly unbearable to hear my own criticisms voiced by a decidedly second-rate Frenchwoman . " It is the strength of this republic , " I spoke sententiously , in the rolling French periods of a Chateaubriand , " to take from every class its leaders , particularly in time of war . Naturally , you will say "  --  the poor woman was not about to say anything  --  " that by constantly changing those leaders we fail to create a continuing sense of splendour and of hierarchy but  --  and bear this forever in mind  --  by so doing we avoid the tyrant 's sway . " I can do this sort of thing in French by the hour . In fact , I once competed at Saint-Gratien with the novelist Flaubert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour of listening to the two of us , I with my gracious Dr. Pangloss looking forever foolishlyon the bright side and Flaubert with his idiot , prone not only to rapturous arias in which not one original thing is said ( " I adore the Gothic ! It aspires to be ! " ) but to the most alarming facial tics and inadvertent lunges of the body , Princess Mathilde agreed that we were equally horrendous . When dinner was done , the French lady fled me gratefully . The gentlemen stood about after the ladies retired . Baron Jacobi sought me out . " I am desolate to think that your daughter  --  and you , too , sir  --  will not be permanent in this city . " " I am sad , too . We 've been most marvellously entertained here . " The Baron conducted the conversation in German , a languageI speak not too easily . " I read , of course , your piece on the last days of the Emperor Napoleon  --  " I detected a malicious glitter in his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " But one can not live by The Nation alone . " " I admired your Cavour . I knew him . " The little man reads everything ; spoke knowledgeably of Cavour ; also , mentioned some old pieces of mine for the North American Review , and asked if I knew its current editor . I said that I did not . " A splendid man , a fine scholar  --  " We were interrupted by the genial Mr. Blaine . " What is this strange language that I hear ? " Baron Jacobi shifted to English ; told Blaine of our common admiration for the editor of the North American Review . " In fact ,  |p194I  believe that the editor 's father , Mr. Charles Francis Adams , is being spoken of to lead your party . That is , if you , Mr. Blaine , should not choose to succeed General Grant . " This was a most mischievous remark for a diplomat to make , I thought , but then mischief is , apparently , Baron Jacobi 's style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor does anyone save the Almighty , if that cup will pass to me or , if it does , whether I will drink thereof . " Blaine has a fine comic style when he chooses , cheerfully willing to parody the ponderous locutions of the American statesman , so like the ubiquitous carnival salesman of snakeroot oil . " But I can tell you one thing . If any Adams should ever again be elected president , he will kill his own party just as dead as the other two President Adamses killed theirs . Show me a President Adams , sir , and I will show you a particide . " The Baron was called away , and for a moment I had Blaine to myself . " How do you think the election will be fought ? On what issues . . . General ? " Blaine gave me a most comical look . " Mr. Schuyler , I served my country in the late conflict as best I could by editing the Kennebec Journal , and supporting with fiery editorials the Union cause , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kennebec reminded me suddenly of Benedict Arnold 's invasionof Canada during the Revolution . I mentioned this . Blaine was intrigued . " We 've got all sorts of legends about Arnold up in those parts . Aaron Burr , too , who was with him . You were a protege of Colonel Burr , were n't you ? " A polite euphemism , often employed by the press . I acknowledged a relationship and passed quickly on to the election . " Well , your friend Mr. Tilden will make a great noise about corruption in Washington , and I must say after Babcock , Schenck , and Belknap , all three so fast in a row , he 'll be able to make some good points . But I do n't think that corruption ever really excites the people one way or the other . " " What does ? " Blaine indicated the silent stubby figure of the President , held captive by a number of his eager guests as well as by his high office . " The fear of the North at the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The war 's been over for ten years . There are other issues . Civil service reform  --  " I was interrupted graciously but firmly . " Our people vote onlyp195against what they fear , what they dislike . Since more people resent the South than fear the North , we shall win , as usual , providing things cool down a bit . " " No more scandals ? " " Not too many more . " Blaine smiled , the shiny black eyes alert . " Besides , if your friend Governor Tilden is nominated , I suspect he is going to have to spend most of his time explaining  --  well , about this and that . I mean he was a railroad lawyer , and precious few of them ever taught Sunday School . " But my interview with what now looks to be the next president was causing jealousy ; and Blaine was taken from me . I found myself with a member of Congress from somewhere in the West who said , " I have a subject for your literary talents , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the time to write the narrative myself . We would split the profits , naturally . What about sixty per cent for me , forty for you ? " I felt positively giddy  --  jeune fille or , rather , jeune poule , being bid for . " I do n't , I fear , collaborate ... " " You will , on this story . " The man  --  I still do n't know his name  --  looked about furtively to make sure that no one was listening . Needless to say , no one was . Each of the powerful men had managed to collect a crowd about him . Blaine 's was the largest , as he is expected to be the next president . Grant 's was next in size ( although he is the president , he will be gone in less than a year and so does not need cultivating ) . Garfield , Chandler and others I did not recognize stood at the centers of lesser groups beneath the smoking chandeliers . " I know who murdered Abraham Lincoln . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor Booth . " The man shook his head pityingly . " You believe that , too , I see . " " Well , Booth was observed behaving in a most suspicious way after the murder , jumping onto the stage of Ford 's Theatre , denouncingthe President ... " " But , Mr. Schuyler , cui Bono ? Who profits ? " " Mr. Booth 's histrionic mania . " " But who , above all , profited ? " " " The Vice President , I suppose , who succeeded him , Mr. John-son . " " Exactly . " " But he , too , is dead now . So  --  "  | " Others are alive , sir . And certain of those who were responsiblefor Lincoln 's murder are present in this very room tonight . " I fled the madman by attaching myself to General Garfield , who was now working his own way toward the President . As I bade Garfield good evening , the handsome face beamed down at me and he took my hand . Because of a twisted arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerfully first pulling , then turning you toward him . " Lucretia certainly enjoyed her talk with you , and insists you and the Princess come see us . " Incidentally and apropos nothing , I did not celebrate my sixtythirdbirthday today . Both Emma and I had forgotten it entirely . As of 1:00 A.M. , March 27 , I have nothing to say about old age and death , except to note how unsettling it is to find oneself so much older than the leaders of this country . Garfield and Blaine and Conkling are in their mid-forties ; each young enough to be my son . The world hero General Grant is almost a decade younger than I ; yet in his sombre presence , I feel myself reduced to boyish irrelevance . The time I was allowed to spend in that high presence was not long . Garfield graciously started to present me , but the President cut him short , not rudely but firmly . " We have had the honour . " Again I was struck by the beautiful voice emerging from that grizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Mr. Schuyler in the Ledger on the EmperorNapoleon . . . " Garfield did his best , but it was not enough . " I think Chancellor Bismarck the greatest man in Europe . I would like to meet him . " Tangential but significant statement : Bismarck destroyed the Emperor and the Empire . " The Chancellor certainly understands the uses and the ends of power . " I rallied : my North American Review style can , usually , dominate any discussion . " Then he must be lonely . " There was a sort of twitch at the beard 's center that might have been a smile . " Lonely because no one else knows what he knows ? " " Yes , sir . " For a moment there was silence . General Grant had simply stopped . I am told that this is a familiar tactic of his , calculated to put the other person on the defensive as well as to save himself from boredom , not to mention indiscretion . But then , uncharacteristically , as Garfield said later , the President suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of power was simply a trust , given me to maintain the Union at any cost . "  | " And using that power , you achieved the end you wanted . " " Well , when a war stops there is a halt , but I do n't know that it 's an end . The fight goes on in other ways , does n't it , General ? " I le turned to Garfield , who proceeded to speak so eloquently and so animatedly that I can not remember one word he said , so busy was I staring at General Grant , as if there might be some external clue , some magical wart that would explain him to me. " ... as in the case of Santo Domingo . " I did hear Garfield say that because it was  --  is  --  the wrong subject to mention in Grant 's presence . The President scowled . " Sir , we had every right to intervene in Santo Domingo . And if I had not been stopped by the Congress that island would be ours today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own president who asked us in . " Note ( added later ) : According to Nordhoff , at the beginning of Grant 's Administration , the ubiquitous Babcock had worked out a plan with the corrupt president of Santo Domingo for the United States to annex that country for a price which was then to be divided by the Santo Domingan president , Babcock and ( enemies say ) Grant himself . Congress refused to pay for the annexation , to Grant 's fury . Garfield was soothing . " There were so many misunderstandingsat that time . " Emboldened by wine ( and by my sixty-third birthday : what have I to fear of any man ? particularly a soon-to-be former President ) , I said , " I have often wondered , sir , at the change in your own policy . You condemned the Mexican War of ' 47 which ended in our seizing from Mexico all the land north of the Rio Grande . Yet twenty years later you wanted to annex Santo Domingo without consulting that nation 's people . " I shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I think that my impolite and highly apposite challenge was worthwhile . At least I did not have to listen to the usual tedious discourse on horses that most people are treated to by this canny and deliberately dull little man who is , I would say , like the first Bonaparte , entirely immoral or amoral , but unlike the Emperor , burdened with the Puritan 's sense of sin and retribution . This combination can make for confusion . I got a long stare from the President : the eyes suddenly very clear , very bright with anger . Garfield was plainly distraught at my lese-majeste.  |p198When  General Grant 's response finally came , it was characteristic . " The president of Mexico did not invite us to invade his country and attach a part of it to the United States . The president of Santo Domingo offered me his country for a fair price . By wanting to buy this island I did no more than Mr. Jefferson when he agreed to buy Louisiana , or than Mr. Johnson when he agreed to buy Alaska . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way into the Red Room , where Mrs. Grant reigned . " Well , " said Garfield , somewhat shaken , " I never thought I 'd hear anybody tax General Grant on that subject , and in the White House . " " Bad manners , I know . " I was reckless because of the sixtythirdbirthday ; also , the Grant Administration must of necessity be the chief target of Governor Tilden and I must do what I can to help prepare the case for the prosecution . " But I was curious . And he did bring up the subject first , in a way , by mentioning Bismarck . " We followed the crowd of men into the Red Room . " I 've almost never heard anyone get him on the defensive like that . " " It is the privilege , General , of the historian , and of the old . " Happily , while I was shutting for myself the White House doors , Emma was opening them wide for herself . Mrs. Grant has taken a fancy to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladies ' afternoon . " She also told me how she found out the President was n't going to stand for a third term . " We were preparing for bed , the long evening at an end . " From the newspapers ? " " Almost . She said that she 'd gone into the President 's office on a Sunday afternoon . He was n't there , but the Cabinet was all present , which she thought very strange because the Cabinet never meets on a Sunday . When she asked the ministers why they were all there , they said it was simply coincidence . Then the President came in and she said , Ulys '  --  she calls him that  --  ' what 's happening ? ' and he said , Just wait till I light this cigar . ' And then he told her that he had met with the Cabinet and had read to them his statement that he would not be a candidate for president . Then while she had been talking to the ministers , he had sent off the letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , too ? ' And he said , Because if I had , I 'd never have been allowed to post it and I do n't want to stay here another four years . ' She was quite fierce because she would like to spend the rest of her days in those hideous rooms . " It is late . I am tired . I am no wiser on the subject of General Grant than before . I suspect that he is as corrupt as those about him ; otherwise , he would not have such men as intimates . Certainly , I shall never believe the usual Stalwart explanation : that Grant is a simpleton and does not understand politics or people . He understands both very well indeed and , I suspect , likes neither . It is late . I am tired . I am  --  but it is not possible !  --  sixty-three.  |p200NORDHOFF  CAME to the suite this morning with a long telegramfrom Jamie , requesting more " snap " in my pieces " because you are much too cool , just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nordhoff , " that is what I try to be while you are the snappy one . " " Ignore him , " was Nordhoff 's good advice . I had not seen Nordhoff since my White House evening over a week ago . He had been amused by my confrontation with the President . " I suspect that 's the first political statement any guest has ever got out of him . Usually , he goes on and on about the war and who was where and when and why , or about his horses . You know , some years ago , Grant is supposed to have told General Sherman that he had decided , deliberately , to interest himself in horses because , he said , If you do n't pick your own hobby , the press will pick one for you , and then you 're really in for it . ' " " Like drink ? " " Or like the ladies . " Nordhoff is disapproving of loose morals , as are so many ex-sailors.  | " There are those who deny Grant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know for a fact that there were times in the war when he was never sober . But now he seems all right , though a few years ago at a dinner in New York with Jim Eiske and some low-life cronies , Grant got so drunk that he put his cigar wrong way round in his mouth , and singed his beard . " Nordhoff gave me the day 's scandal as I waited for Emma to return from a visit to Mrs. Fish ( the ladies have now met but I have yet to set eyes on the Secretary of State and his wife ) . " The President 's younger brother Orvil is mixed up in the Babcock affair . He 's scheduled to go before Clymer 's committee ... " " And lie ? " " What else ? " Nordhoff 's glee at the wickedness each day revealedalternates with gloom as he then contemplates the meaning of the wickedness revealed . That is why his style is so much more vivid , more journalistic than mine . I try for balance , to consider the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle , amazed , horrified , outraged by exotic flora , dangerous fauna . The Garfields had proposed a picnic if this day , Sunday , proved to be pleasant . The day was lovely and so apicknicking we went beside the Rock Creek , a charming small river that winds betweenlaurel-covered hills in a forest at the edge of the city . The Garfields had also invited Baron Jacobi and Madame Jose Garcia . This extraordinary lady is the wife of a Peruvian diplomat , the daughter or niece of some South American autocrat , and the authoress of a number of novels , including Love in the Pampas , a gorgeous trashy work that Emma dearly loved when it was published some years ago . Madame Garcia is very rich , very lavish in her entertainments and very , very fat even by the lenientstandards of this plump society . We were deposited by our carriages on a mossy bank just above the creek where , beneath slender trees in newest leaf , Lucretia Garfield and Emma unpacked the picnic hamper . Seated on a fallen log , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to take the air , to sparkle in April light , while their large owner praised nature : " The air ! So fresh . And the amusing flowers ! Look , Baron Jacobi , a primrose , no ? " " No , my dear . A poppy . " " And , hark , the sound of water purling over rocks . " " Purling , ves . " Baron Jacobi gave me his quick amused lizard'sp202glance . " I have never before heard anyone actually say that word . " " In that case , we must celebrate . " Garfield was most charming . He opened a bottle of wine and we all drank to " purling . " " A common English word surely . " Madame Garcia flashed her black eyes at the company . " I encounter it every day  --  in poetry , of course . I read nothing else . I find that poetry makes me more alive , more quick to seize the passing moment ! To extract from it true pleasure , made by art divine . " Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Madame Garcia 's person and pronouncements , Emma and I were much amused , as the Garfields had intended . Later , Baron Jacobi napped in the warm sun while Madame Garcia nodded over a volume of verse ( not slim but every bit as fat as she ) . Emma and Mrs. Garfield spoke in low voices of important matters . I looked at General Garfield expectantly . Nothing here is ever done at random , even a picnic . " Shall we take a stroll ? " Garfield is a restless , active man . I am neither . I said that nothing would please me more . Heart sinking ( and pounding ) , I accompanied my host through the woods . I do not much care for nature , and believe that flowers belong in vases rather than loose and untidy on the ground . But I do feel better for that stroll ; when I shut my eyes , I can still see the shimmering vivid green effect of sunlight filtered through new leaves , emphasizing the darker green of low-growinglaurel . I am beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revel in all of glorious nature ! " she had confided to me , methodically killing ants with a small rock . At the top of a low hill , we paused . There was not much view , just more hills similarly wooded . Behind a hedge of lilac bushes I could make out a small dilapidated cabin . " An ex-slave lives there . A nice old man who is supposed to make a most superior whisky . " " What an incredible institution , slavery . " I do n't know why but the sight of the slave cabin made me actually think of the fact of slavery , something difficult to do , since the word itself ( like the institution ) has for so long been made meaningless by too much furious prose , both for and against , not to mention by all the killing done in its name . When one hears too much of a subject , one ceases to comprehend it at all . " We are well rid of it . Now we must worry about the Chinesep203who are being imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people . " A few more remarks on the Chinese ; then we sat on two tree stumps , only a few feet apart . As we smoked cigars my host gradually came to the point . " I read your last piece ... " " Filled with errors , I know . " " I saw only one which might not be an error , after all , if ... " There was a pause . A new beginning . " You seemed fairly certain that our party will nominate Mr. Blaine for president . " " I thought that was your opinion too . " " It 's my wish , certainly . But . . . well , I must tell you in all confidence , there is about to be yet another scandal . " " Involving Blaine ? " Garfield nodded . " We have not had much luck these last few months , have we ? " " Perhaps your party has been too long in power . " " Perhaps . Though I do n't think your friend Tilden will order things any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a Bigelow you must admit t here is a world of difference . " But Garfield is not much interested in what the reform element calls " good government . " He is a conventional party man whose only singularity is his reputation for honesty . Except for that one small slip with Credit Mobilier , no scandal has ever been attached to him ( for the record , I must add that all-important word " yet " ) . Garfield came to the point . " About seven years ago when ; laine was Speaker of the House , he became involved with a Mr. Warren Fisher , a Boston contractor who was to build a railroad called the Little Rock and Fort Smith . " Garfield 's mind is such an orderly one that he was able to make what must be a very complicated business so plain that even I am now able to understand it . . . up to a point ( up to the point intended ? ) . " Mr. Blaine Nought very highly of Mr. Fisher and of his railroad . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some friends . " " Was Mr. Blaine a bond salesman before he went to Congress or only after ? " This small pleasantry did not charm my companion , who puffed very hard at his cigar and looked above my head , as though expecting to see a storm cloud in the bright sky . " Mr. Blaine is much too good-natured a man . " Garfield 's answerwas not to the point . " Also , he is casual in his business affairs . Certainly , he ought never to have involved himself withp204Mr . Fisher . In any case , shortly after the bonds were sold , the railroad nearly failed . " " And the bonds he had sold his friends were worthless . " " Until the Little Rock and Fort Smith was bought by three other railroads , of which one was the Union Pacific . " It was with real distaste that Garfield said the name of his only known corrupter . " As a result , the bonds of Mr. Fisher 's railroad regained their value . But there were  --  there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three railroads to help out Mr. Fisher in order to save his friends . " " I see no harm in that , " I said , beginning to make out the vague shape of a familiar crime . " Nor do I. The reverse , in fact . Mr. Blaine was embarrassed . He felt he had let down his friends . So he set out to save Mr. Fisher 's railroad and succeeded . " " On the other hand , " I was now able to make out certain features of that no longer so vague shape , " there will be those who think that Mr. Blaine may have done some favour for the three rescuing companies . Otherwise they would not have wanted to buy a worthless railroad . " " Far from worthless , Mr. Schuyler . I am told the Little Rock is as sound as any road in the country . " Garfield exhaled blue smoke slowly , and through the haze I saw resting on the branch of a tree a red bird , known in these parts as a cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omen . " So you believe that this transaction is going to be used to damage Mr. Blaine . Garfield let his cigar fall to the ground ; then with the heel of his boot , he buried the stub deep in soft moist earth . " Yes . And it 's going to be used against him in a most diabolical way . Just before the Republican Convention , in June , the . . . the enemy will make those charges , figuring that by the time Blaine has been able to prove himself innocent , the convention will have chosen someone else . " " Senator Conkling ? " " Probably . Certainly , we will never nominate Mr. Bristow . " The usually mellifluous warm voice was suddenly flat , nasal , hard . " And you think that Mr. Bristow is behind these charges ? " " Who else ? He wants desperately to be president . And in his mad way , he thinks that by destroying , one he will be greatly surprised . Meanwhile . . . " Garfield stopped . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected of me . " You think that if I were to write this story for the Herald and publish it next week , say , that Mr. Blaine would then have nearly three months in which to defuse , if I may use a military metaphor , the scandal . " " I see no reason why you should be helpful , Mr. Schuyler . " The bright April blue eyes were moist , sincere , quite irresistible . I felt , for a moment , as if I were in the presence of the handsome son that I never had ( or , for that matter , wanted ) . " I know that you are a Democrat and a friend of Governor Tilden . I also believe that you are a fair historian and that you would not like to see a . . . well , a great man , as I think Blaine is , not only falsely accused but unable to defend himself until it is too late for him , and for the country . " Garfield was absolutely winning , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way back to Rock Creek . Madame Garcia was reading from her book of verse ; the powerful voice echoed against the rocks , the hills . In the trees frightened birds chattered warningsto one another . Then suddenly the sun went behind a hill and the blue shadows turned cold . " " Time to go ! " Lucretia Garfield was on her feet at the sight of us . " I think I 'm getting a chill . " Baron Jacobi helped Emma to her feet while Garfield and I used our combined strength to set Madame Garcia upright . " What a successful picnic ! " exclaimed Baron Jacobi . He looked closely at Garfield and me . " I suspect a plot , gentlemen . " " Tonight , " said Garfield to me , " the Atlantic cable will bear a message to the Bulgarian government of the most sinister portent , in cipher . " " Except that my secretary mislaid the cipher and I 've sent no messages for a month . Your plots are safe with me , gentlemen . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We then divided ourselves so that Baron Jacobi and I were with Garfield while the three ladies travelled in the second carriage . Had Madame Garcia been less large we could all have travelledin a single victoria . Lucretia insisted that the men travel together because , " They will want to smoke like chimneys . " But we did not smoke . We spoke instead of history . Garfield is devoted reader of the classics . Baron Jacobi has read the classicsp206but is not devoted to them as history  --  " only as literature . Who , after all , believes a word that Julius Caesar wrote ? His little history ' was simply a sort of leg up for his political career . " " But if we ca n't believe those classical writers whose works have come down to us , then how can we ever know any history ? " Garfield is passionate on the subject . " I think , General , the answer to that is very simple . We can not know any history , truly . I suppose somewhere , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , a precise true record . But what we think to be history is nothing but fiction . Is n't that so , Mr. Schuyler ? I appeal to you , perversely , since you are a historian . " " And therefore a novelist ? " " Malgre vous . " " I agree , Baron . There is no absolute record . When I was trying to write about the Communards in Paris  --  and I was there at the time  --  I could seldom find out just who was killed by whom . " " But surely , gentlemen , there is a winnowing process . History is distilled from many conflicting witnesses . We do know that President Lincoln was murdered , that General Grant commandedthe Union army . " " But no one knows the name Achilles took when he hid himself among the ladies or the lyrics of those songs the sirens sang . If Mr. Schuyler will forgive me , I prefer fiction to history , particularly if the narrative involves people that once lived , like Alexanderthe Great . " " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels by Dumas . " I always want to know what is true , if anyone knowsit . " " But no one does except the subject , and he  --  like Caesar  --  is more apt than not to lie . " " But , " said Garfield , " we now have letters , diaries , newspaper cuttings  --  " " Dear General , is there a newspaper in the United States  --  other than The New York Times  --  whose reports you believe ? " Garfield saw the humour . He laughed . " Well , if future historianswill read only the Times  --  " " They will think that the Grant Administration was absolutely superb  --  as does the minister from Bulgaria , " added the Baron quickly , " and entirely free of corruption . As for letters , journals , who ever writes the truth about himself ? "  | " You are too cynical for me , Baron , " said Garfield , himself every bit as cynical but in the agreeably open American way . " I would make a bonfire of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Livy ... " " But how then would you learn about the past ? " " From Dante , Shakespeare , Scott  --  all fiction writers . " " But Shakespeare 's history is always wrong . " " But his characters are always right . Anyway if you want to know what Julius Caesar or James G. Blaine or our own delicious James Garfield is really like , then look into a mirror and study with perfect attention what is reflected there . " After supper , I sat with Nordhoff in the rotunda at Willard'sand repeated to him what Garfield had told me about Blaine . " Very clever , " was Nordhoff 's verdict , delivered through ahalf-dozen amused barks . " Then Blaine did do  --  favours for the three railroads ? " " Favours ! He is in their pocket . He is also in Fisher 's pocket . When Blaine sold his friends all those Little Rock and Fort Smith bonds , Fisher made him a present of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ' worth of land-grant bonds and thirty-two thousandfive hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Blaine had used his influence as Speaker of the House to see that Fisher 's railroad was awarded a crucial land grant by the Congress . " Then he 's in very deep , " was the most I could think to say . " Over his head , I 'd say . But you can never tell in Washington . " " Garfield seems to think Bristow is behind this . " " The Stalwarts think Bristow is behind everything . But if Blaine is destroyed , it wo n't be the work of Bristow . It will be because for the first time in years there is a Democratic majority in the House and they are out for blood . " Blood . Red . I thought of the red bird on the green bough , my tiuod omen . " Garfield is clever , then , to want me to tell the story now , in his version . " " Yes . Because then the scandal will have come and  --  he hopes have gone before the convention in June . " " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thoughtful . " Certainly it is very useful for us  --  for you  --  to have General Garfield as a friend . " " Then I should write the story in such a way as to please both him and Blaine. "  | " Yes . Then I shall follow up , day after day , with all the terrible details . " " And that will be the end of Blaine ? " " That ought to be the end , but he is very shrewd , as well as the most intelligent , most likable man down here . " " So then let us allow him to be the president . " Nordhoff found this amusing . " I do n't think it 's really up to us , worse luck . The Democrats will take care of him in due course , preferably just before the convention . But , in a way , you are helping him by publishing part of the story now . As for letting him be the president  --  now , really , Schuyler . " " Yes , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that enough ? " " Not , it would appear , for the American people . " " You are hard on us . I want this election to be a reveille . I want everyone to wake up . And we can do it , too , you and I and a few others . " " Make history ? But there is no history , " I said , trying out in my own voice Baron Jacobi 's theory , " only fictions of varying degrees of plausibility . " " What ? " " I meant to tell you that I had an amusing conversation with Garfield about history . He assured me that one can learn the truth about the past through old newspapers , letters , diaries . Then he proposed to help me write , as it were , the history of Mr. Blaine , by setting down in the Herald all the lies he would like to see in print . " " But now you know the truth . And the truth always comes out . " " Dear Nordhoff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the truth . And you could be mistaken . As for the truth always coming out , why , I think it never does . But even if it did , who would know ? "  |p209AMIE  BENNETT TELEGRAPHED : " Your report on Blaine will insurenomination of Conkling and election of Tilden talk of nothing else in New York congratulations " while a long letter from John Bigelow was most flattering , not to mention promising : " Just an hour ago I was in the Governor 's office and he was reading aloud to several friends your astonishing  --  well , your definitive  --  revelations about Mr. Blaine . The Governor was delighted , and praised you highly . Secretly we are both a little sad because we saw Mr. Blaine as the candidate , and an easy one to defeat . Conkling will be more difficult , and Bristow most difficult of all . Fortunately , Bristow is hated by the Stalwarts ; in fact , Chet Arthur has told a number of people that Bristow will never hold office again , as a Republican . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be such a kingmaker ! ' Of course the world has yet to hear from Mr. Blaine . " Indeed the world had not when Bigelow wrote me . But today  - -  April 24  --  the beleaguered colossus of the Republican party rose to his feet in the House of Representatives and , on a point of personal privilege , proceeded to make one of the most eloquent speeches in the history of that body , or so everyone says . I would not know , for I was at the dentist having a back tooth pulled . I - still groggy from the nitrous oxide I was given , and my right jaw , which for some years has not been exactly what Mrs. Southworthwould call " lean , " is still grotesquely swollen . But Emma was at the Capitol with Nordhoff ; and when the speech was done , both came to see me on or , rather , in my sick rocking chair . Nordhoff promptly seated himself at the desk and began to write his piece for tomorrow 's Herald while Emma described the apotheosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nordhoff . " He was adorable , Papa ! " Emma is truly stimulated by this rite 's peculiar theatre.  | " What a word ! " Nordhoff said , continuing to write rapidly . " But he was ! You 've never seen so many enthusiastic people . And everyone was there . " " Except me , " I mumbled through swollen jaw . " The cause of it all . " " Poor Papa ! I never asked about the tooth . Was it painful ? " We despatched the tooth as a subject , and returned to Blaine 's performance . " His voice shook . He sobbed at one point ... " " Like an actor , " said Nordhoff , and proceeded , I am sure , to write the phrase at the same time he was saying it , " a bad actor . " " He convinced me . " But then Emma was thoughtful . " Well , perhaps he did not convince but he overwhelmed us all . There were even cheers from the people in the press gallery while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've never seen so many handkerchiefs waved , heard so many hurrays ! " With gusto , Emma imitated the nasal brazen sound that my countrywomen make when they publicly express their pleasure . " I am sure he was marvellous . " I spoke wetly , for blood and saliva have been filling my mouth all day and I must keep moppingmy lips with cotton wool . I turned to Nordhoff . " But what did Blaine actually say ? " Nordhoff put down his pen . " Very little . He claimed he was being persecuted in the press ... " " Did he mention the Herald ? " I was keen to know if Blaine had made reference to me , but though my article was the very first to expose him , he had named no names . I was , I fear , piqued at this omission . The speech was about political partisans and their unrelenting hostility to good government and to the party that had saved the Union , freed the slaves , and honoured James G. Blaine . " But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I would like to take all the credit for the bold exposure , but with some effort I acknowledge Nordhoff 's assistance . " Why did those railroads buy the worthless stock of the Little Rock and Fort Smith ? " " He read a letter . " Nordhoff was grimly amused . " He read that letter superbly well , " added Emma . " From whom ? " " From the treasurer of the Union Pacific Railroad . " Nordhoff looked down at his notebook . " Dated March thirty-first , sayingp211that the railroad had never paid any money to Blaine . " " As if the treasurer would have written anything else to Blaine . " I must say the man is bold , the public gullible . A series of barks from Nordhoff , and a demur from Emma : " There were other letters . But the point is that he was so forthright . So honest . So  --  well , charming in the African style , " she added , dropping her voice so that Nordhoff would not hear , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma nor Nordhoff has been able to give me any idea of what Blaine actually said , but the way that he said whatever it was that so delighted his listeners has saved at least this one day for him . Nordhoff finished his story and rang for a page to take it down to Mr. Roose to send on by telegraph to the Herald . Then Nordhoffdelivered his verdict . " Blaine 's got away with it . " " And I did the wrong thing ? From our point of view ? " I must say that I am revelling in a most uncharacteristic and charmless way in my sudden fame . For two weeks I have been known from one end of the country to the other as the brave and fearless journalist who dared to expose the clandestine activities of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives . Wherever I go in Washington , the most celebrated people gather about me , and listen respectfully to my every word . During these last few days it has got so that I want no one to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this day 's vivid and historic performance , Blaine 's is now the central role and I am eclipsed , at best a pale ghost of a moon hardly visible as his sun blazes . " This is just the beginning . " Nordhoff assumed his special secret face that I have come to recognize as prelude to some devastating revelation . " Then there is more ? " Emma was intensely curious . " Oh , yes . " I , too , did my best to achieve a secret face despite a swollen jaw . " There is more to come . " " Oh , dear ! " Emma is now a complete Blaine partisan . She looked at Nordhoff and then at me and back again , but we refused to satisfy her curiosity . Then a second page appeared and presentedme with a copy of Washington 's Evening Star . " This was sent you , sir . " " By whom ? " I gave him a coin . " Do n't know , sir . Just came . That 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likep212that terrible swift sword so savagely celebrated in the bloodthirsty " hymn " of one Julia Ward Howe , a denizen of " the eveningdews and damps " of Beacon Hill . With numerous asterisks and blanks for names and horrendous puns , the P*** d'A*** was linked romantically with the B*** J*** while , in far-off New York , a youthful American suitor did not dream that he had been jilted by this frivolous French woman . Nordhoff was surprised at how lightly Emma and I took Fay 's vengeance . We explained to him about the kerosene . Emma was not at all contrite . " How was I to know that her hair would fall out ? It must not have been attached very firmly to the scalp . I shall send her a hat . " Emma went in to dress for dinner . I walked Nordhoff to the door . " What next ? " I asked . " We accumulate more evidence . " Again the secret look . " Where do you get it from ? " " Ah ! " Nordhoff was maddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest man . That is a fact . " " But hardly loyal to his president , to his party ... " " He is loyal to principle . " " That ! " I am heartily sick of principles , affected or real . " Anyway , I 'll let you know in due course . It should be amusing tonight for you to visit the enemy 's camp . " " I find it hard to think of the Garfields as enemies . After all , he is a devoted reader of mine . " " Not to mention collaborator . " I was unexpectedly embarrassed . I do like Garfield , and dislike deceiving him . But then of course he lied to me ; got me to provide Blaine with time enough to answer the charges against him . Yet I am uneasy whenever I dine at Garfield 's house and he takes me into his confidence . . . but then I am not taken into his confidence . I must stop this sentimentalizing . I am with ravenous wolves . This is Africa . Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous tropical storm that suddenly broke over the city at sundown . Much thunder and lightning and gusts of wind full of rain turned the unpaved streets to thick mud while horses stumbled , carriages slid , umbrellas turned inside out . Finally our carriage stopped at the corner of Thirteenth Street and I , and we braved the storm that flung us like flimsy dolls hardp213against the Garfields ' pleasant red-brick house , so like all the other pleasant red-brick houses of the town . We were then propelledby the wind through the front door held half open by a delighted servant . The interior of the house is pretty much like all the other houses that we have visited . On the left of the entrance hall is the parlour with its inevitable upright piano and slate-mantelled fireplace . On the right of the hall , the family sitting room is at the front of the house and the dining room is at the back . The dinner guests were in the parlour : a room whose only distinction proved to be a pair of tall Chinese vases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Lucretia Garfield was visibly pleased to have her own taste confirmed by Emma , who is thought to be an authority on every sort of " tong . " A dozen guests had already assembled , amongst them the dread Madame Garcia who has taken to flirting with me in a most alarming way , thundering her heavily accented French into my ear whilst allowing me vistas of what appear to be four very large breasts encased by all too fragile whalebone beneath a purple muslin marquee or tent . As I record her bold advances I am suddenly aware that I have not had a single amatory encounter during all this time in WashingtonCity . Nordhoff is too much the puritan to be of any use . In fact , when I made a delicate inquiry or two , he pretended that I was joking . I daresay he thinks me too old for this sort of thing . One of the waiters in the bar at Willard 's did propose sponsoring me at an establishment on Ninth Street , but I was not feeling sufficiently hearty at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dismissed . The specialty of the town is the mulatto , or " high yellow , " girl and I confess that , once or twice , I have seen truly **27;3550;TOOLONG girls in the street of the sort to inspire languorousdaydreams even at congressional hearings . If only Jamie Bennettwere here to guide his old uncle ! Garfield introduced me about the room . For the dozenth time I met the courtly Horatio King , who organizes literary evenings at which Garfield shines . I have so far avoided these Parnassian revels but " Soon , Mr. Schuyler , soon we shall have the pleasureant sure " Madame Garcia threw me a flashing black-eyed glance . " I shall bring him , Mr. King ! I le too shares our passion for Art and forp214Life writ large ! " On the gale of her explosive sounding of the word " passion , " I was propelled toward Baron Jacobi , who took both my hands in his and exclaimed , " To think , Mr. Schuyler , that I shall soon be able to address you as Father ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said so . But Emma and I were both amused . Everyone , needless to say , had read Fay . Emma was serene , " I never dreamed Mrs. Fayette Snead 's revengewould be so charming , and so flattering . " With that , I lost Emma to the Baron while I met the British minister Sir Edward Thornton and his wife , a couple that are produced in considerablequantity by the British Foreign Office . Zach . Chandler was also present ; just as we were shaking hands Garfield was called away to greet new arrivals , fugitives from the storm that still thundered and whistled about the house . " Well , sir , how did you like Mr. Blaine 's answer today ? " asked Chandler . " I did n't hear him . I was having a tooth extracted . " I touched my lips with the handkerchief that I have been clutching all day . " Answer ? " The anesthetizing gas had made me slow ; in fact , this whole stormy day and evening linger in my memory like a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , do n't be modest , sir . You 've caused a considerable commotion . " Chandler smiled down at me  --  a formidable grey face , much lined , with a shark 's mouth and dead eyes . I can not say that the Secretary of the Interior charms me . " At least , " I rallied , " our friends the Belknaps are off the front page for a time . " Chandler nodded . " A blessing , small but appreciated . " " Does the impeachment continue ? " " Since the Democrats control the House , there will be an impeachment . Of course the whole thing is illegal . How can you impeach and try and perhaps remove from office a member of the Cabinet who is no longer in the Cabinet ? " I did not make any contribution to this subtle constitutional question because , like the Devil himself , with a clap of thunder and a gust of wind , James G. Blaine had entered the room from the vestibule and stood in the doorway . Garfield promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost an embrace ; as he pulled the hero close to his side , he quite blocked from view the charming Mrs. Blaine . Applause from everyone in the parlour , save the foreigners  --   |p215and  myself . Then the great man made a slow progress through the parlour , receiving compliments with a gracious smile until he came to me and the smile became gaily conspiratorial . " Mr. Schuyler , I guess you know by now that I spoke only to you this morning . Yes , sir , to you directly . From the very first moment that I saw you up there in the gallery , I said to myself , If I do n't convince Mr. Schuyler who 's sitting there , looking down at me with that skeptical look of his , then I had better quit politics forthwith and go back to Kennebec . So . . . " He paused dramatically . " What did you think ? Tell me the unvarnished truth ? " " The unvarnished truth , sir , is that I was not in the gallery but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caught in his splendid lie , Blaine respondedsplendidly . " Then I addressed myself with all my heart to your double , to a counterfeit Charles Schermerhorn Schuy-ler ! " " But from what everyone tells me , your speech itself was purestgold , and in no way counterfeit . " f For the first time Blaine gave me a truly amused and interested look ; it is obvious that he enjoys his own performances and is more amused than not to find his art appreciated , even at the expense of his plausibility . It may well be that Blaine is what the country needs ( and deserves ? ) . In any case , as of today , it looks as if Blaine is what the country is going to get , at least as Republican nominee for president. isGarfield was euphoric . He got me to one side , looked at me with those beautiful blue eyes , and said in a low voice , " You have saved us . " " You exaggerate , General . " I was uneasy , not wanting anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment . " No . Your article was perfectly balanced . You repeated the charges that were being whispered , and so , by bringing everything to a head , Mr. Blaine was able to answer his enemies , to clear his name . " " But has he ? " I was perverse and irritable . Those who use do not like being used . " To the satisfaction of everyone . Obviously die-hard partisans will not be convinced , but I 've just learned that The Nation is going to support Mr. Blaine , and all as a result of his speech today . " I suppose Garfield thought that I would he impressed byp216The Nation , a most intelligent and virtuous journal , and as capable of making errors as any other paper . " You think the matter is ended ? " I was genuinely curious , recalling Nordhoff 's secret face . " There 'll be no more revelations about Mr. Blaine and the railroads ? " " It 's a dead issue . " Garfield was emphatic . " Oh , there 's some talk among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't get far . That 's a promise . Fact , after today , I have a hunch they 'll all dry up pretty fast . " At dinner I sat next to Mrs. Blaine . Not unnaturally , she was somewhat prickly , but I did my best to convince her of my impartiality . I do n't think that she is in on the plot . If she is , then she is as good a performer as her husband . In any case , we did not mention l'affaire Blaine . Other topics concerned us . Although she spoke at length of her admiration for General and Mrs. Grant , there was a mocking edge to some of her stories . But then Grant is supporting in a not-so-secret way Blaine 's rival and bitter enemy Conkling . " I know that people complain of General Grant 's silences but let me tell you they are to be preferred sometimes to his actual conversation . Just the other day I sat next to him at dinner and I tell you , Mr. Schuyler , that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All about how ungrateful the country is and how he is always being held responsible for everything that goes wrong , and how the newspapers have always been against him even during the war when they were guilty of treason for what they wrote in support of the South , and how the British gave so much money and property to Marlborough and to Wellington for saving their country while he got nothing at all from us Americansbut a job he never wanted . It was something of an earful . " Mrs. Blaine also told me of a recent day spent with Emma . I pretended I knew all about it , but , again , Emma has surprised me . Apparently she has met Mrs. Grant twice since our dinner at the White House . I knew of the first visit with : " All the ladies of the town , drinking tea . And very dull they are . " But day before yesterday Emma met Mrs. Grant at the house of Mrs. Fish . Mrs. Blaine was also there , and spoke glowingly of Emma . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a moon . And so patient ! Mrs. Grant kept asking her all these questions about Paris and what places she and her Ulys ' ought to visit when they go around the world after they leave the White House . "  |p217I  have just asked Emma about the tea party chez Fish . Emma looked genuinely surprised . " But I told you all about it , did n't I ? " " Not a word . And you know how I still covet an invitation to the house of the cousin of Hiram Apgar 's wife ! " Emma assured me that I had missed nothing . Emma found Julia Fish polite , dim , Apgar-ish . Mr. Fish was not present . As for Mrs. Grant , " Well , she took me aside , and looked me very close in the face , left eye into my left eye , right eye into my right eye , and said , My mother once spent a night in a cabin with a part of Colonel Aaron Burr 's army in the West , and she told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think why she felt I ought to know this . Of course you used to work for Colonel Burr , but even so ... " Obviously Emma and I do not entirely confide in each other . I can not think why I feel hurt when she does not tell me every detail of her life , no matter how insignificant ; yet I have never told her the most singular fact about myself , that I am  --  as was the late President Martin Van Buren  --  presumed to be an illegitimateson of Colonel Burr . Although I did publish Conversations with Aaron Burr , I have never alluded publicly to any connection between the Colonel and me other than a professional one . Conversation after dinner : the American gentlemen praised Blaine extravagantly to his face while the British minister looked uncomfortable and Baron Jacobi looked alert . I suspect that even as I write this late at night , the Atlantic cable is buzzing with ciphered Balkan wit . Recalling the Antiques ' fury at Blaine , I asked him why he was so unrelentingly hostile to Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Confederacy have been restored . " Andersonville , Mr. Schuyler . " The black eyes narrowed . " " Thousands of our men died in that camp and all because of Davis . He knew what was happening to those prisoners of war . Yet he did nothing . " " But surely others were even more responsible . " " Davis , as president of the Confederacy , had the power of life and death . And he chose death for our brave men . " From the slight roar of catarrh at the back of Blaine 's throat , from the deep rumble in his chest , I knew that I was listening to what will be a major theme in his campaign for the presidency : playing on the hostility of the North toward the South , waving on high the so-called bloody shirt in order to keep alive the passions of the war.  |p218Blaine  also told me that the Democrats in Congress would be blamed for denying appropriations for the War Department ; particularlyhurt has been the Army of the Frontier which protects Western settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , Blaine went straight to Emma , " Well , at least I saw you very plainly in the gallery ! " " And no doubt heard me , too , cheering in the commonest way . " Emma was aglow in the presence of her favourite African chief . " I do like him , Papa , " she said just now . " But he 's an absolute scoundrel . " " So was Napoleon  --  the First and the Third . Anyway the world is made for scoundrels , is n't it ? Certainly , they always manage to do with it as they please . " " I 'm afraid we have been here too long . You are becoming African before my eyes . " " I was born African , Papa . And presently I shall put a bone through my nose and eat human flesh . " On that high note , Emma retired to bed . The swelling in my jaw has gone down , but I am still oozing blood in the most disgusting way . Old bodies take so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Philadelphia . I am so wearythat I think it most unlikely I shall be able to write more than a few words . Emma is also exhausted and has gone to her room on the opposite side of the hotel . There was no suite of rooms to be had . In fact , only a series of telegrams from Bryant demanding rooms for us in the name of the Evening Post kept us from spending a night in the streets , for the Centennial Exhibitionopened this morning and every room in the city is taken . I realize now that I am much too old for this kind of journalism , but as a beggar I am in no position to choose where I go or what I do . I feel most unwell . Although this is my first visit to Philadelphia , I shall not record here my first impressions of the old capital of the republic  --  other than to say that whatever virtues the city may possess are entirely obscured by the several hundred thousand visitors who have made the town a nightmare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a sleepless night ( the walls of our hotel might just as wellp220have been made of paper like those of the Japanese pavilion at the Fair ) , we got up at dawn to the merry sounds of hawking and spitting , of yawning and groaning , not to mention a number of loud domestic quarrels . Emma and I met in the hotel restaurant for breakfast , only to find that the groaners , hawkers , spitters , yawners and domestic battlers were already in possession . So with empty stomachs and nerves stretched taut , we proceeded through a fine hot drizzle to the depot of one of the three new steam railways that connect the city with Fairmount Park , where an entire new city has been erected on some two hundred acres . Thirty-eight foreign nations have each put up a characteristic building , as have the various states of the Union . A specially built railroad circles the Fair . It is . . . No ! I shall save all that for the Evening Post . At about 8:oo A.M. the clouds lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find seats on the special railway car reserved for " honouredguests . " I was well equipped with all sorts of documents , ensuring Emma and me the very best accommodations everywhere , as befitting the representative of the nation 's most distinguishednewspaper . " It is like the Paris Exhibition . " Emma was delighted by the splendid new exotic buildings . Many are literally exotic : built by Japanese , Turks , Tunisians ; others because they represent the very latest in architectural styles . The honoured guests were allowed to sweep past thousands of early arrivals who were waiting in line at the turnstiles . We chosen few ( there proved to be four thousand of us ) were then admitted to the south door of the Main Building . Here each of us was given a map of the seating arrangements in front of the Memorial Hall at the opposite end of the Grand Plaza . Emma and I had been placed just behind the presidential party , thanks to Bryant . The Main Building covers twenty-three acres ( I can not keep out the statistics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is made of glass with a central nave nearly 2,000 feet long . One would have the sense of being in the world 's largest railway station were it not for the huge imperial eagles on plinths  --  and , of course , the exhibits . With our fellow four thousand , we left the Main Building by the north door . Immediately overhead was a temporary platform built to support an enormous orchestra and chorus . Beyond thep221shadow of the platform was the Grand Plaza , a sea of gummy red earth ending in the grandiose Memorial Hall . Here wooden stands covered with miles of red , white and blue bunting had been built to contain the notables . In the center of the plaza two colossal statues make hideous the prospect ( for the Post , I shall be more tactful ) . One colossus is of Pegasus ; the other is of an Amazon standing beside a horse slightly smaller than she . Emma thinks that it is not a horse but a big dog . Once we had found our seats , the orchestra began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some two hundred thousand people , I am told , filled the Grand Plaza . Certainly , it was a considerablemob . I was happy to note that the two dreadful statues were soon hidden from view by dozens of boys who seated themselves on Pegasus 's back and wings , and on the Amazon 's broad shoulders and thick head . Our fellow honoured guests proved to be so distinguished that Emma and I spent the better part of an hour gawking , like countryfolk come to the fair . The entire diplomatic corps from WashingtonCity was on hand , all aglitter with gold braid and orders . Baron Jacobi 's costume was vaguely Hungarian ; he waved his tur-lined cap at Emma . We decided that he had invented his own costume in the name of Bulgaria . The Justices of the Supreme Court , the leaders of the Congress , the principal generals and admirals were all to be seen in the grandstands . Or nearly all . The very greatest of the personages delayed their entrances until the rest of us were safely seated and the crowd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the theatre ! " Emma was having a marvellous t une . Particularly when , to the strains of some military march ( not " Marching Through Georgia " ) , the erect figure of General William Tecumseh Sherman appeared . To much whistling and shouting , the General made his way to the empty presidential box . Like so many of our warriors and statesmen ( at least in the early days of the republic ) , Sherman is red-haired . General Philip tiltcridan was then applauded . So , too , was a genial-looking mann a frock coat . I asked the man sitting next to me ( a member of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ) who this civilian hero was . F hat 's the Secretary of the Treasury , Mr. Bristow . " My informantwas obviously a Stalwart Republican ; he did not applaud . The applause for Bristow was slow to get started ( in appear/ance he is an unprepossessing man , but he holds himself well , as if certain of some unique destiny ) . Plainly aware that unlike the famous warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of our grandstand and waited for the word to spread throughout the huge muddy plaza , now entirely filled with men in holiday black , with women in bright hats . Gradually one heard , louder and louder , the sibilant in Bristow'sname until the fervent applause of those nearest him was taken up by concentric ring after concentric ring of humanity until , at its crescendo , he turned to the people  --  his people-to-be ?  --  removed his hat , bowed , and took his place with the rest of the Cabinet . Emma was amused . " The other Cabinet ministers do n't seem at all pleased . Look at Mr. Fish . He seems to be asleep . " " In an election year , all politicians dream of glory . " Then James G. Blaine was in the Grand Plaza , riding the mob 's thunder as if it were a wild horse to be broken . He waved his hat as he turned to left , to right ; bowed and grinned . No doubt about it , between him and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House to a speculator , " I heard myself observe to Emma , " pocket the cash , and the people would still love him . " I do admire the man 's audacity . " It 's because he is one of them . Because they 'd do the same thing if they dared but they do n't dare because they know they 'd be caught and they know he 'll never be caught ! " Emma was breathless from cheering Blaine . I saw Baron Jacobi watching her with amusement  --  and watching with equal amusement me watching the whole extraordinary spectacle . As Blaine moved toward the grandstand the people almost engulfed him ; but then soldiers in blue swiftly formed a cordon and pushed back the crowd . Next appeared Dom Pedro , the emperor of Brazil , with his empress . This eccentric gentleman has been for some time at Washington incognito ; although he is furious if any official pays the slightest attention to him , he is even more furious when he is not treated in a manner properly befitting the ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much cognito today and plainly overjoyedby the sensation he caused . Bowing , smiling , waving , with his white moustaches and goatee , he looks like an elderly version of Napoleon III . As Dom Pedro is the only foreign chief of state at the Exhibition , he is duly cherished by the mob for his conde/scension . He is also in his element , for he loves science , and spent much of the day listening to a new invention called the telephone which makes it possible for two people at a distance of miles to conduct a conversation . " It talks ! " Dom Pedro kept shouting . We were then treated by the orchestra of Mr. Theodore Thomas to the national anthems of thirteen countries . The orchestrawas very loud , and I am edified to have heard not only Argentina 's " Marcha de la Republica " but Austria 's " Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser " all in one morning . Exhausted by so much patriotic ardour , we were not prepared for the next extraordinaryeffort on the part of Maestro Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion by Richard Wagner . " Astonishing ! " murmured Emma . " Are there no American composers ? " " None so good apparently . " As one who likes the new music , I think it amazingly intelligent , not to mention courageous , of the Centennial Committee to have given the commission to Wagner and not to some local sweet-singer . Emma prefers Offenbach . Simultaneous with the beginning of Wagner 's march , the presidential party came into view . To the sound of French horns , t he President appeared with Mrs. Grant on his arm . As the music continued , the two little figures and their entourage took their places in the central box just below us . I was somewhat startled t hat the President 's entrance had been covered by music , that he had not been allowed the sort of ovation the other great men had received . I soon discovered that whoever had planned the pageantryknew exactly what he was doing . By the time the orchestra was silent , the presidential party was seated and a bishop was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . This holy man favoured peace , commerce and God , in that order . When he sat down , the chorus treated us to a very loud hymn , whose words had been written especially for the occasion by the American poet J.G. Whittier , who piously hoped t hat America 's future would be bright . Next the head of the Centennial Committee made a speech , which , I think , turned everything over to the government ; this was duly accepted , at some length , by a general . We were then obliged to listen to a very long poem by a Mr. Sidney Lanier , entitled Cantata . So badly was this long poem delivered that hardly anyone but me heard the actual words . Due to some acousticalvagary , I heard every line . Not surprisingly , the poet praisedp224the United States . He , too , hoped for a better future . " At least we have American poets , " I said to Emma , who sighed . It was now close to noon . We were all beginning to wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many distinguished people too closely pressed together about us , from the relentless music , poetry , oratory . Then the accepting general ( must get his name ; I 've mislaid the schedule of events ) spoke at length ; he ended by presenting to the people their President . General Grant got to his feet . From our seats just above the presidential box , we had an excellent view of his back . He moved slowly toward the lectern . This is the moment , I thought , in which all the earlier displays of delight will be surpassed . Grant was now in full view of the crowd , the text of his speech clutched in one hand . He paused . He looked straight ahead . He waited . But there was nothing , nothing at all from the crowd : only silence , an absolute dead silence for the hero of Vicksburg and Shiloh , for the saviour of the Union , for the twice-elected President of the United States . I saw Mrs. Grant turn suddenly to the person next to her ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm in her face . For a long dull moment the President simply stood there , speech in hand . Finally , someone cheered him . Then a second cheer went up , which made it even worse , for after that there were no more cheers . At last , in a resonant and dignified voice , General Grant read his speech , which was graceful and mercifully short . He even struck a modest note , a sound seldom heard in this self-regarding land . " While proud of what we have done , we regret that we have not done more . " I think that this reasonable sentiment must have distressed his audience ( it is usual for their masters to sing their praises ) , for when the President finished , the original silence that had greeted him was now replaced with quite a number of jeers , whistles , and booing . Emma looked at me in amazement . " They have turned against him ? " " It would seem so . " " But I thought he was their hero . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long . Let 's hope it will be Governor Tilden 's turn to be hero next . " As we spoke , I caught a glimpse of Grant 's face as he turnedp225away from the mob to take his seat . Most of the distinguished guests were applauding him . In fact , the Emperor of Brazil was waving his hat over his head like a cowboy . The bleakness of Grant 's face , however , was not altered by the applause of friends . I lc had just been given harsh proof that he had lost the people who once had worshipped him , and any hope that he might have entertained of continuing in office was now entirely at an end . Meanwhile , a hundred-cannon salute was being fired and a huge American flag went up a pole at the center of the plaza , while orchestra and singers deafened us with the " Hallelujah " chorus . Then it was over . Led by the presidential party , we moved on to Machinery Hall , which proved to be nearly as large as the Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large called the Corliss engine . I have not yet found out what this machine is supposed to do ( mercifully , the directors of the fair are providing us journalistswith elaborate descriptions of the various exhibits ) , but I must say that the size of this double engine is most impressive ; it is about six times the height of a man , made of some dark gleaming metal . On a platform at the base of the machine General Grant moved into the place of honour , the Brazilian Empress on his arm ; he was followed by Mrs. Grant on the arm of the Brazilian Emperor . Mrs. Grant looked very grim . General Grant 's expression was , as usual , puzzled and withdrawn . Rather dementedly , and certainly tactlessly , the Brazilian Emperorkept waving his hat in the air rather more times than was entirely necessary , emphasizing the uncomfortable fact that the crowd was deliberately cheering him and not the President . At a signal from an official of the fair , the President and the F.mpress moved toward a . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned politely to the Empress , said something to her , and she , very firmly , pushed a valve . The huge engine began to pump away most impressively , if to no immediateor practical purpose that I could see . This was the occasion for more cheers , more waves of the Emperor 's hat , more scowls from Mrs. Grant . Then , like the sea receding from some mechanical or " automated " ( new word ) shore , we distinguished guests left the buildingand our distinctions behind in order to join the humble thousands , as well as Mr. and Mrs. William Sanford , who were gazingp226rather blankly at the nearby State of Pennsylvania Building . Denise and Emma embraced like sisters united after years of separation . Sanford and I shook hands , our common distaste in abeyance for the sake of the ladies . Apparently , the Sanfords had also been in our grandstand . " We saw you and I waved and waved but you never looked the right way ! " Denise took one of my arms and one of Emma 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Paris restaurant . " I hear it 's first-rate Provencal cooking . " Sanford always knows whatever is best wherever he is . " That means garlic , which I love , " said Denise , in a most unladylikeway . " And truffles , which I love , " I said , rather greedily , for we had had no breakfast . " But truffles are from the Dordogne , " said Sanford , wishing successfully to enrage . The restaurant was already crowded , but a few whispered words from Sanford brought the maitre d'hotel over to Emma . In the rapid French of the Midi , he said how delighted he was to receive her , a countrywoman whom he had long admired . Emma was gracious . The rest of us were hungry , and the food was good though ridiculously expensive . I asked the Sanfords where they were staying . " In the car , " he said , as if I ought to have known . It took me a moment to realize what he meant . Like a number of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowded city , the Sanfords chose to sleep in their private railway car . " Just go to the Broad Street depot , and there we are , " said Denise . " Next to the U.S. mail . " And to the depot we went , rather self-consciously , in full eveningdress ( " Giving a little dinner for Senator Conkling , " said Sanford . " You both must come . " ) On a siding , we found the glossy , highly ornamented car of the Sanfords . " Very odd , dining in a railway station . " Emma was much amused ; also much pleased to see Denise again . So , too , was I. We both found her unexpectedly glowing and happy . Feeling a bit strange , we made our way into the long , narrow ( what other shape ? ) salon of the railway car . A dozen guests were already assembled . Senator Conkling was not one of them . " Deserted us . " Sanford was cool . " There 's some reception forp227the President tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll survive . " Denise took Emma round to meet the guests . Sanford did the same for me . The gentlemen looked rather like the ones at Madame Restell 's . The ladies were like those at Mrs. Paran Stevens 's , which is to say they are handsomer than those at Mrs. Astor 's but less brilliant than those at Mrs. Belmont 's . We were waited on most efficiently by two black butlers , and the small kitchen , or galley , of the car produced a surprisingly elaborate dinner . Had it not been for the occasional coming or going of a train , one might have been seated in any luxurious if peculiarly shaped New York dining room . The lady next to me at dinner was large , elderly , coarse-looking , but with good eyes and a marvellous speaking voice that sounded hauntingly familiar . She spoke with delight of the Exhibition . " Two years ago I bought and learned to use the Sholes printing machine . That was the first of those many lovely new typewriters we saw today . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am frightened of machinery . " " I am devoted to machines . They are so much more reliable than people . " I worried about her all through the evening . Was she an au-t hor ? Another Mrs. Southworth ? Why else would she own and operate a typewriter ? She also spoke knowledgeably of politics . " I must say that I am surprised General Grant had the bad taste tit appear at the Exhibition today . He was superb in the war , of course . " She was violently against slavery . She told me that she had lived at the South before the war ; yet she speaks with an English accent . I could not begin to figure her out . Not until we were leaving did I discover from Denise that I had been talking to Fanny Kernble. " " 1'he idol of my youth ! " I was stunned . " Why , I saw her when she first performed in New York forty years ago . " Colonel Burr and I had gone to see her , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least two generations . When very young , she interrupted her career to marry a slave-owning Southerner . She was so appalled by the peculiar institution that she turned fiery author . She now lives in Philadelphia . Through ignorance , I missed an opportunity to talk of old days.  |p228I  did have a chance to talk of new days , with Denise after dinner ( there was no lingering of gentlemen at table in that tiny dining room ) . Denise and I sat in a loveseat . Most of the others preferred to stand . One half expected a conductor to come through and ask for our tickets . " Emma says she will come to Newport , Rhode Island , in June , if you agree . That means I must force you to say yes . I shall use any and every weapon . " I had not expected such a sudden assault . " But I shall be in Washington City then , and after that I may go to Cincinnati for the convention  --  " " You are not going to drag Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that cruel . And Washington in June is likeCairo in August . " " No , no . " Actually I have been counting on Mrs. Astor to invite Emma to stay with her next month when I begin my deep plunge into the electoral process . But to date only silence from the roseate mystery . Denise is delicate in these matters ; guessed at my dilemma . " You 're both coming to New York next week . So why not let Emma stay with me at the Brunswick . Then when you go back to Washington , she 'll stay on with me until you know your plans . " " If she would like that , why , of course  --  " " She does , and it 's done ! " Denise was luminous with pleasure at having got her way . I looked about for Emma , wanting confirmation . But she was not in the salon . Denise saw my puzzlement ; she put her hand on my arm . " Emma 's with Bill . In the office . " Denise indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know what we 're doing . " " I wish I knew what you two are doing . " " Well , it 's for a good purpose . Oh , I ca n't wait for all of us to be in Newport together ! It will be heaven on earth for me . " " For him , too ? " Denise smiled . " I must say , we . . . Bill and I . . . have never got on better . I ca n't think why . But then no woman is supposed to understand her husband . " " I think you 've got that the wrong way round . " Denise suggested that I go into the office . " Quite by accident , of course . And see how the plot is progressing . " Somewhat baffled , I walked the length of the salon ; tried not to step on toes in that small space.  |p229Behind  the red velvet curtain the office proved to be a tiny cubicle almost entirely filled by a mahogany desk , at which sat Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sanford , who was sitting opposite her , his back to me . " You are certain it will work ? " Sanford sounded anxious . " Absolutely . " Emma 's voice was firm . Then she looked up and saw me and smiled and said , " Papa , we are making presidents . " Sanford leapt to his feet . He seemed agitated . " And presidents-tobe , " she added . " Your daughter wants me to jump into the arena . " " Only because I ca n't do it myself ! " Emma rose . " It 's so unfair , this exclusion of women . " And she meant what she said , for , to my astonishment , she has succumbed to African fever just like Blaine and all the others . On our way back to this sinister hotel , Emma told me of the plot with Denise . " Mr. Sanford knows I do n't like him , and he knows how you despise him ... " " Despise ' is too strong a word . " Our conversation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour in traffic . The night was like daytime and very gala with thousands of revellers in the streets , mostly drunk . " Anyway , Denise wanted me to charm him . " " I think you 've already done that . " " The flowers ? No . Or at least that phase of the charm ended when Denise and I got to be friends and he became jealous of the way we 've excluded him , or so he thinks . " " And tonight ? " " Denise wanted me to prepare him for the summer . To make him like me . " " It is not often , Emma , that I sound like a father but all this plotting is very dangerous . " " Dangerous ? " I could not see her face in the half-light from a pair of gas lamps used to illuminate an advertisement for " I.L . Baker 's Celebrated Sugar Pop-Corn Machine , at the Exhibition . " I mina shifted to French . " I do n't think so . Certainly Denise and I , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ingenious . " " Proposing that he go into politics one day ? " " Better than that . I thought he should go to work for Monsieur Blaine . I told him that , if necessary , I could help him  --  remove tirnator Conkling from the race . " .. The business with Kate ? " " Yes . She told me a great deal in the Rue Duphot. "
