There is no way of fixing the precise moment at which the radical left decided to pause in its headlong pursuit of the apocalypse , but the reason for the halt was clear enough : nothing was working right ; it was time to retrench , reassess . <P> For the extremists , the first signal illumination came in the explosion last March that ripped up a Weatherman bomb factory in Manhattan , killing three members of the group . Weatherman activity declined , and then , early in December , Fugitive Bernardine Dohrn , one of the group 's leaders , issued a manifesto that was at once a critique of past mistakes and a manual for future strategy . <P> The document , titled " New Morning-Changing Weather , " declared that " the future of our revolution has been changed decisively . " The March explosion " forever destroyed our belief that armed struggle is the only real revolutionary struggle . It is time for the movement to go out into the air , to organize , to risk calling rallies and demonstrations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebellions do make a difference . " <P> For radicals , it was a new political awakening . The bombers had at last learned what millions of angry Americans had known all along-that the Weatherman was little more than an underground collective of grimly moralistic Bonnies and Clydes . Analyzing Weatherman tactics in a forthcoming Ramparts article , Writer David Horowitz observes that the terrorists overlooked the political consequences of their deeds ; karma was their trip . Revolution had almost ceased to be a strategy of social change and had become instead its own justification , a cult , " a yoga of perfection . " The result was that the Weatherman had lost , not gained ground for the movement . Their self-styled revolutionary vanguard had far outdistanced and alienated virtually all branches of the moderate and radical left . <P> It is likely that the final nudge toward at least a temporary renunciation of Weatherman violence came from Radical Priest Daniel Berrigan . Last August , three days before he was arrested , Berrigan sent the outlaw band a brotherly and eloquent admonition , warning that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . " Revolution is only " interesting " insofar as it " avoids like the plague the plague it promised to heal . " Berrigan urged the Weatherman to " do only that which one can not not do , " and reminded them that " the history of the movement in the last years , it seems to me , shows how constantly and easily we are seduced by violence , not only as a method but as to an end in itself . With very little politics , very little ethics , very little direction and only a minimum of moral sense , if any at all , it might lead one to conclude in despair : the movement is debased beyond recognition . I ca n't be part of it . "
