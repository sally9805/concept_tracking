Like the company he heads , William M. Agee is self-assured . <P> Bendix Corp. , the Michigan-based manufacturer of automotive and aircraft parts , housebuilding materials , metalworking tools and many other things , is a nononsense , tightly reined outfit . It made money throughout the recession and stacked up just under $3 billion in sales last fiscal year . Agee , who was named the company 's chairman last December after Michael Blumenthal was selected to be Jimmy Carter 's Treasury Secretary , is a tested and talented manager and financial man-as he tells anyone who asks . Practically the only thing he is touchy about is his age : businessmen , Wall Streeters and journalists often remark how unusual it is for a 39-year-old to run a company so huge . " Look , " says Agee , " there are n't a lot of people who have had-at whatever age - the top management responsibility and deep involvement that I have had . " <P> The sandy-haired son of a farmer from Boise , Idaho , Agee was a skinny but skilled jock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his freshman year and transferred to Boise Junior College , then to the University of Idaho and finally to Harvard Business School . <P> The Harvard M.B.A . ( class of ' 63 ) also helped land him a job with Boise Cascade , the Idaho-headquartered forest-products company , which was growing rapidly . After four years , Agee was company treasurer ; two years later , he was vice president and chief financial officer and pulled down the corporation 's third biggest paycheck . Nothing was left but to take over the top job , but it was clearly predestined for John Fery , then executive vice president . <P> Rapid Rise . In 1971 Blumenthal of Bendix decided to set up an " office of the chief executive , " consisting of himself and three executive vice presidents . Early the next year , a head-hunter was dispatched to offer Agee one of the second-rank spots . Agee , impressed by Blumenthal 's intellect and rapid rise from refugee to corporate leader , accepted . " I brought more business experience to the table than Blumenthal had , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install what he calls " early-warning systems " in budgetary planning to forestall " unpleasant surprises . " He joined Blumenthal in leaning hard on lower-level executives to meet high profit goals . By December 1976 , the boss was so impressed that he abolished the troika of No. 2 men and anointed Agee president . Only two weeks later , Blumenthal got Carter 's call and Agee became chairman .
