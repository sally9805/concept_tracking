Since it breezed through Congress in 1970 , the Clean Air Act has significantly improved the atmosphere Americans must breathe . Sulfur dioxide levels are down by 30% and sooty particles by 33% . Cars , too , are less polluting as Detroit struggles to meet tough emissions standards . Yet for all the progress , air quality in most major U.S. cities and industrial regions is still below the goals set seven years ago . Now a drive to clear the air has set off the fiercest environmental fight in years . <P> At issue are long-overdue amendments to the 1970 act . As expected , environmentalists want murky clauses clarified and loopholes plugged , but industry and labor-including the 1.4 million-member United Auto Workers - are arguing that the economy is sometimes more important than the ecology . In response , the House has passed an amendment to the 1970 act that seriously undermines the nation 's clean-air standards , while the Senate favors legislation that holds the environmental lines . So wide is the gulf that Maine 's Senator Edmund Muskie , a principal author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says he : " Reaching agreement will test the legislative process to its limit . " The main areas of dispute : <P> AUTO EMISSIONS . Under the 1970 act , automakers had until the 1975 model year to eliminate 90% of all hydrocarbons ( HC ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) and nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) . Detroit has cut harmful emissions considerably : this year 's General Motors cars , for example , produce 90% less HC and 83% less CO than those of the early 1960s . But faced with the difficulty of reducing emissions while also cutting gasoline consumption , the automakers persuaded the Environmental Protection Agency to extend the deadline to 1978 . Now they want still more time and less stringent standards . The Senate is willing to give them until 1979 , the House until 1980 . Detroit could be caught in a squeeze . Unless standards are soon set that it can meet , the upcoming 1978 models can not be certified for sale . <P> SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION . Under recent court interpretations of the 1970 act , the EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's air but take active steps to prevent " significant deterioration " where air is still relatively pure . Environmentalists see these steps as safeguards against further despoliation by belching factories and power plants . But industry is sure that they will , as a Chamber of Commerce spokesman says , only " mandate undeveloped areas into eternal poverty . " The House version would leave enforcement to the jurisdiction of the states and allow up to 18 days a year of pollution in those areas . By contrast , the Senate has voted not only to retain EPA 'S authority , but to add a Carter Administration provision that is making industry fume : a so-called best available technology clause , which requires polluters to install such expensive pollution-control devices as smokestack " scrubbers.
