 | The Unknown Carol Burnett If money is the mother 's milk of politics , then gossip is the lifeblood of Hollywood . The town is small , the guest lists often the same , and the egos in constant need of reinforcement . I doubt if Mother Cabrini herself could have lived in the film capital long without having her robe stained by vicious chatter . At a dinner party recently , I sat through a typical character assassination session . Such and such was heavily into cocaine . So and so just left her husband and was now romancing her pool man . Toward the end of the evening , when at least threescore reputations had been pretty well destroyed , I raised a name . " Anybody know a Carol Burnett anecdote ? " I asked . " I 'm writing an article about her , and she seems completely normal . Can anybody in this town be that . . . nice ? " Silence descended while brains went into gear . Finally a woman , the wife @# of a producer , spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has her face lifted ... she had her nose done one summer . . . the eyes another time . . . a little chin tuck now and then .... " " Wait a minute , " I said , thinking of the weeks of bruises sucn surgery usually entails . " Carol Burnett works every summer during her television layoff . Last year she did a movie and a summer-stock tour with Rock Hudson . She was n't out of the public eye continued on page 129  | g enough to have a wart removed . d besides , I saw her this afternoon , close , and I did n't see a sign of a ce fix . Her eyes are sunken a bit ; ere are wrinkles here and there . But suspect she 's happy with herself the ay she is . " The woman shrugged . " Maybe it was somebody else , " she said . Hurriedly she eased into another story about a famous tor and his wife who flew to Rio , had eir posteriors lifted by a plastic Burn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropological tour . There have been changes in CarolBurnett during the past year , but they were nothing to do with plastic surgery . er remarkable face , which seems comp : sed of equal parts Silly Putty and wizard 's wax , remains entirely her own . True , the visage is rarely in repose when its owner is in public , for she prone to screwing on those extraorary masks which can transform her m crone to cooch in an instant . But en when she 's on view , there 's a new turity around the eyes , a certain renity , an enviable attitude of inner dence that fellow actor Austin dleton says reflects " a very secure ter . " I must interrupt myself here to admit at I 've long been a shameless Burnett fan , considering her talent providential daring the past years when Americans have found so little to laugh at . But I 'd been apprehensive about meeting her fear she would be more like , say , - surly Kaye , a funny man in public but - :e who in private can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My first encounter with Carol set me straight . She 'd been talking about herr ecent tour on the summer circuit . " Did -e June bugs fly into your mouth ? " I 'd sked , mindful that outdoor theaters e notorious for such hazards . " They ould n't dare , " she 'd shot back . " Every night before I go on I gargle with Raid . " But I found her a lot quicker with a punch line than with self-analysis . When it comes to talking about her newfound self-confidence , her friends are more helpful than she is . Says one , It 's as if she 's turned from clay to steel , but nice steel . She 's very much her own woman these days ? no longer just a clown . It 's probably the result of a lot of things ? woman 's liberation , her commitment to ecology , the realization that with her enormous following she can score a bull's-eye against any target she wants to hit . " " Maybe I 'm just older , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 , but elects to be no more specific than that . ) Or maybe it just took me this long to iecide that what I felt or said might be important to somebody else . My new motto is , ' No More Fumfering ! ' " Fumfering , she translates , is lowering your head and making mush talk . " I always used to be so afraid I would hurt somebody , and I never wanted to make an enemy . I wanted everybody to love me ! I spent far too much time doing things I did n't want to do ? both on my show and in real a life . Now I 've found it 's easy and good a for you simply to say NO . I should have tried it sooner . " a She gives much of the credit for her newfound confidence to yoga , something a she embraced passionately about a year IY ago . " I had just come back from Sydney , Australia , and I had terrible headaches. a I was painfully skinny and I was chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to mention that she had suffered the same kind of head- TV aches until she took up yoga . I figured : What the heck , it ca n't hurt worse than my head already does . . . . " Carol practices a kind of yoga called a Hat ha which concentrates on getting the body in condition and makes no a corollary demands on the mind . " You do n't have to meditate or worry about your soul unless you want to , " says H Carol . " There are no strings attached . " Carol has always been ardent about keeping fit ( she once organized and r led an exercise class at CBS for anybody who wanted to attend ) , so her yoga kick is not surprising . One day when we talked she had just come from a three-hour session . Her face fairly glowed with health . " I 'm at the point now where I am boring my friends with how wonderful yoga is , " she said . " But you want to know something ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n aspirin and I 've put on nine pounds and I still wear size six and I 've never felt better in my life ! And maybe in about two months , I can even stop talking about it so much . " She glanced ii over at her husband , Joe Hamilton , who was talking to a production aide 9 and swinging an imaginary golf club at the same time . " I 'm sure my husband would like me to shut up this very afternoon . " With that , she closed an imaginary d zipper across her mouth and remained i silent for perhaps ten seconds , the time it took for her secretary to place a snack plate of two avocado halvesibe- C fore her . Carol adds vegetarianism to sl her yoga . For breakfast she blends an elaborate drink of raw egg , bone mar- i row , citrus powder and yeast . A large t glass of this , plus a cup of herbal tea , give her enough energy to sail through the day . " I 've even given up coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carol needs even more b energy than the " old , " for although she a has always put in dawn-to-dusk hours . t she is now carrying additional responsibilities . During the first seven years of The Carol Burnett Show , which now f has a weekly audience of 25 million families , she rarely participated in the t planning and writing of the show , but d simply did ? and did superbly ? what- a ever her producer-husband and staff e cooked up . And she could often be sweet-talked into doing something she did n't want to do . Now she is attending i weekly production meetings , throwing in her own sketch ideas , criticizing ? and sometimes vetoing ? other people 's . ! Her skin grows thicker . These days she can even accept a compliment . In times past , when someone praised her for a performance , Carol would squirm and brush it off , mumbling something about how the writer or director really deserved the credit . Now she simply responds with a cool and crisp , " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shoulders , kiss her and say , " I think you 're a sexy , sensuous , exciting woman . " Now , instead of blushing , she 'll shoot back , " Well , do something about it ! " The only time in her career that she 's had to face harsh public criticism was when she married Joe Hamilton in 1983 and reports circulated that she had broken up his existing marriage . He was the father of eight children . " All you can do with lies like that is cope , " said Carol . " You either cope or you leave the country . " " It bothered her for a long time , " says Hamilton . " I knew she was hurt , even though she tried to cover it up . She can always put on a funny face , but she really did n't know how to respond to the rumors ? which , by the way , were inaccurate . All I can say is that she handled the situation perfectly . She is adored by all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepchildren and they go to her with their problems before they come to me . When she tells them something , it sticks ; when I do , there 's an argument . " The eight Hamilton children , now ranging in age from 13 to 24 , have been in and out of Joe and Carol 's lives for the past 11 years . But only on rare occasions have those eight ? plus three daughters from Carol and Joe 's marriage ? all been together . What is it like when they are ? Hamilton cringes . " Loud ! " Carol 's three daughters ? Carrie , ten ; Jody , seven ; and Erin , five ? are developing their own personalities , each radically different from the other . Carrie is a tall , blonde , coltish youngster with a not-so-thin slice of her mother 's ham . She 's recently discovered a phone gimmick called " Dial-a-Joke . " Says Carol , " Every day when I get home , she 's waiting for me with a new zinger . " Jody is possessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a waiter , a calculator , " observes Carol . " While she 's sizing up a situation she 'll hang back and not say anything . Then ? BAM ! ? she hits you with a line . She and I are different . I 'm inclined to blurt out the first thing that comes into my head . I 'm surprised I still have a tongue left , I 've wanted to bite it so often . " Erin , five , is " my killer . She is , let 's face it , cunning , " says Carol . " When we 're out in public , Erin starts talking too loud , and she goes in for heavy drama for no good reason . She already sees herself in front of those TV cameras . " The other night Erin announced that she had been thinking over the pros and cons of an acting career , and had decided to consent to appear on her mother 's program . " I 'd like to start off in small parts , of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129  | Shaking her head emphatically , Carol responded with a resounding No ! " My old lady did n't have a TV show of her own , " said Carol . " You go out and work for yours the way I did . " The Hamilton live in an enormous red brick Beverly Hills mansion ? once owned by Betty Grable ? big enough to accommodate a fair-sized Texas village . Because of the Hearst kidnapping , a guard is now on duty 24 hours a day . Both Carol and Joe are practical jokers ( recently they invited a friend to dinner and when he rang the doorbell , the whole family turned out to pretend he 'd come on the wrong night ) and so the house often rings with laughter . But it also has a museum-like forebodingness that grates on Carol . Furthermore , it 's included on the notorious moviestar maps which enable tourists to drive through the area and spot celebrity homes . ( Once a man rang the Hamilton doorbell at 3 A.M. to say hello to Carol ; on another occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) So last year Carol and Joe began looking for a new and smaller house . Later , having found nothing that was just right , they decided to build . " We 've driven the architects nuts , " says Carol . " Joe wants the facade to be vaguely , though not specifically , French , " and Carol lists three musts : ( 1 ) an exercise room for yoga , ( 2 ) a bathroom " large enough for Esther Williams ' aquacades , " and ( 3 ) " the world 's biggest closet . " If and when it 's ever finished , Carol may have little time to spend in her new home . Her career is booming as never before with television , movies and summer stock . Last year the strain almost caught up with her and she briefly considered not renewing her contract with CBS . The thought of an eighth season on television alarmed her . " She 's pretty thin-skinned , " observes Hamilton . " She ca n't take criticism very well . The thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I wanted her to come back , but I left the decision up to her . And here we are again . She was smart enough to realize that she is a creature of television . " Not long ago , I visited Carol in her dressing trailer at Universal Studios , where she was playing a small , but choice part of a prostitute in a remake of The Front Page . The costumer had squeezed her into a black satin flounce dress that showed plenty of her firepole legs , and on her head was a fright wig the hue of erupting lava . She saw me gaping at the getup and laughed that piercing cackle that could lead regiments or summon attack dogs . Pirouetting in front of the mirror , she stopped to stand sideways and inspect her figure . It was less figure than twoby-four . She is tall and extremely thin ? she weighs 40 pounds less than she did three years ago ? and one wants to stuff a few French fries into her . But a famous homily comes to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin . " Carol currently weighs 105 , and is earning nearly one million dollars a year , making her one of the top ten female wage earners in the country . ( Elizabeth Taylor has n't made that kind of money in years . ) " Well , I ai n't exactly voluptuous . " She sighed at what she saw in the mirror . " But what I 've got is all my own . " Later that day , she would have to fight off a pack of police reporters on a window ledge , then dive through a window in an abortive suicide attempt . Director Billy Wilder had offered a stunt woman , but Carol had refused . " I would n't trust anybody to do it but myself , " she said . " Besides , if I had a nickel for every window I 've jumped out of since I started in this business , I could retire . " The first time people laughed at Carol Burnett was when she got herself up as a hillbilly and strolled out on stage during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one line to say : " I 'm back ! " When she did , the audience howled . " It was an extraordinary feeling , " she remembers . " It was a sort of power that I did n't know I had . " Later , in New York , she lived at the all-girl Rehearsal Club , where Carol , as president , organized a show called Rehearsal Club Revue . Through a sympathetic agent , she persuaded Katharine Cornell to sign a postcard endorsing the production , and then sent out hundreds to producers and casting directors . " We were packed for nights , and I got a job in stock . " Carol recalls the accomplishment with unabashed pride . That memory nudged another dormant one . " I remember in the midFifties when nothing was going right ? I mean I was below the poverty level , waaaaaay below ? I got a job checking hats at a ladies ' tea parlor in Rockefeller Center . Right away I found out the ladies did n't want to check anything and spend a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same level . I practically pulled the coats off @# those guys as they went past me . W they were gone , I would rip away t little ' hang up ' tag on the inside col and sew it back with red thread ? they would be sure to notice It . I 'd p on this hang-dog expression and tell them , ' I sewed this back for you , mister . ' And I 'd usually get an extra dime . I made sometimes 30 bucks a week . " A telephone call interrupted . She spoke agitatedly for a few moments , and hung up , frowning , It seemed that the publicity people for The Front Page had been presenting her as a co-star with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and she felt that was fraudulent . " I 've only got a tiny part , " she said heatedly . " Two scenes long ! I do n't think it 's fair to me or my fans to list me like that . " She told me she 'd agreed to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her salary , incidentally , was to be donated to the Salk Institute , an agency she enthusiastically supports because , she says , contributions go directly to research , " not to carpets for an assistant director 's office . " ( Each Christmas , Carol and her husband make donations to the institute in the name of friends , rather than send presents . ) The old Carol Burnett would have accepted her overblown billing , much as she disliked it . But the new Carol Burnett decided to fight back . At this writing it would appear that she had lost what might be called The Battle of the Billing . When The Front Page was released last fall , she was still being listed as one of the stars . But right up to zero hour , she had n't given up the fight . Her campaign for anonymity ( relative , that is ) had been interrupted over the summer while she toured with her pal Rock Hudson in I Do , I Do . ( Characteristically she had found him " great " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " people would knock down doors just to watch him stand up there and breathe . But he was wonderful . " Note that she said nothing about her own box-office clout or her own performance ? both impressive . ) The last time I saw her ? it was in September during a taping of her TV show ? she was still " pretty sore " at the studio . " In fact , " she said , " I 've a call in to them right now and so do my lawyers . " Although the picture had been previewed , she had n't gone to see it , because she said , " Nobody 's asked me . " " If they do n't cease and desist , " said Carol , " I will get up on this stage at the end of my show and I will tell a few people what 's what . " Not only did this seem unusual , for an actress to actually demand smaller billing , it was coming from a woman who used to describe herself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed more like Bella Abzug girding for battle against the male chauvinists in Congress . " Oh , I 'm changing all right , " she went on . " The good old days are gone . I 've decided it 's time to make my statement . I 'm tired of going into my dressing room and making faces at myself in the mirror . " Then she ran up on stage and went back to work .
