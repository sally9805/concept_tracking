txt What do these last-second , desperate stop-McGovern efforts by Senators Muskie and Humphrey mean ? Do they stand a ghost of a chance ? Yes , but hardly more than a " ghost . " The best delegate watcher in the business , columnist Bruce Biossat of the Newspaper Enterprise Association , was asked by this reporter for his up-to-the-minute assessment of the chances of a stop-McGovern movement succeeding . - Almost nil , " he said . Mr. Biossat says that all this talk about Messrs . Muskie and Humphrey heading off Senator McGovern by picking up uncommitted delegates is " nonsense . " He points out that if Mr. Humphrey , who is closest to Mr. McGovern in delegate votes now , should pick up all the remaining uncommitted delegates , which is quite unlikely , he would still be a long distance away from the 1,509 needed to win the nomination . And that Mr. Muskie has even further to go The Biossat thesis makes sense , particularly with a " reform " convention in which the McGovern delegates will likely be fiercely loyal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come about from governors , mayors , labor leaders , or political chieftains . In fact , such " stop " activity may not even be able to surface in a convention where the " old pros " will not be in their power positions of other days ? at least , not in a way in which they could dominate the show . // *Stopping McGovern now unlikely // Mr. Biossat 's mid-June delegate count showed Senator McGovern with 1,382% . He says the total would now " be approaching 1,400 " Both these figures included an estimate of 245 delegates for the South Dakota Senator in the upcoming New York primary Mr. McGovern needs 1,509 to win the nomination . Obviously , the McGovern momentum is now of bandwagon proportions . Thus , his pulling power on the 500 to 550 uncommitted delegates should be much more powerful than the persuasion now being exerted by Senators Muskie and Humphrey as they tour the states in search of delecates . First-ballot win looms Everything now is moving in the direction of a McGovern first-ballot victory . Should he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles " of all time . Someone might ask " But what if all the uncommitted delegates should join with all of the candidates in a stop-McGovern move ? Would n't that do it ? " Yes . But it is a tremendously big " if . " There are so many candidates who have at least a small bloc of delegates , that it seems almost impossible that they could bury their ideological differences in such a union . Just mention names like Shirley Chisholm , Henry Jackson , and George Wallace and one can quickly see how difficult such a coming together might be . And , again , how could the uncommitted delegates be lured into and kept in the stop-McGovern camp ? given the bandwagon the South Dakota Senator has going for him now ? " A look at history Moreover , political history shows that a first-ballot win is the " norm " at ebnventions of both parties . In fact , in the last 20 conventions , back to 1932 , there have been only four in which the voting went beyond the first ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Wendell Winkle won in six in 1940 : Thomas E. Dewey won in three in 1948 ; and Adlai E. Stevenson III took three ballots to be nominated in 1952 . Yet in a large number of these conventions there was talk of stopping the man who won on the first ballot . In 1960 there was that dramatic last-minute drive to keep Sen. John F. Kennedy from winning the prize . This came at a moment when , in fact , the Senator really had it all but " wrapped up . " There was a lot of sound and fury in behalf of Mr. Stevenson at that convention . In fact , if one listened to the convention 's long ovation for the two-time presidential nominee , he could well have concluded that Mr. Kennedy was in trouble . He was not . He won on the first ballot . Mr. Biossat took a hard look at Kennedy 's delegates six weeks before the convention and found that he was very close to winning . And by three weeks before the convention ( about where we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's count showed Kennedy , like McGovern today , just a breath away from having the nomination .
