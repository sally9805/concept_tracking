txt WASHINGTON  --  When soft-spoken Rudolph Kapustin of Columbia , , Md. , flew to Chicago and quietly checked ' into a motel near Midway Airport last Aug. 8 , he seemed like just another businessman to most of the motel employes . He even rented several rooms , as if he were going to hold a sales conference or marketing seminar . Kapustin 's business is not that mundane . Six hours before his arrival , a World War II B-25 bomber on a training flight had caught fire and crashed just short of Midway 's runway , killing both pilots . KAPUSTIN , 51 , a former airline master mechanic , and his staff of four investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were in Chicago to find out why that B-25 went down . As a senior air safety investigator for the NTSB , Kapustin is often assigned to the agency 's " Go Team "  --  a group of investigators on 24-hour call to rush to the site of an air disaster . NTSB also has " Go Teams " to handle railroad disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called to Chicago to investigate fatal crashes on the Chicago Transit Authority  --  the most recent being the collision Feb. 4 on the Loop elevated that killed 11 . To find out why the CTA train crashed , NTSB rail safety specialist Hubert H. Jewell Jr . ' s investigators have run tests on both the brake and signal systems of the wrecked cars all worked , checked maintenance records , and calculated the physical forces at work in such a crash . On Wednesday the NTSB opens a full blown hearing in Chicago to interview under oath everyone involved . Jewell is no stranger to the CTA . He was in charge of the investigation of the Jan : 9 , 1976 , crash in the Addison Street station of two CTA trains . That crash resulted in one death and more than 300 injured . The NTSB is the small by federal standards ) agency of 300 persons headquartered here at 800 Independence Blvd . It was established in f966 to inves , tigate and determine the causes of transportation accidents and to recommend how they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials admit they do not have the manpower to investigate anything other than the most important of the transportati a accidents which each year in the United States claim 49,000 // Column 1 Disaster is its business // lives . Most of those fatalities-44,000-occur on the highways . Because it is relatively new to the Washington scene , the safety board is often confused with larger and better known agencies , such as the Federal Aviation or Federal Railroad Adininistrations . Unlike those agencies , the NTSB has no regulatory powers . It can not consent , only advise . " Because we have no regulatory or enforcement powers , people ask what good we are , " said Edward Slattery Jr. , ? safety board public affairs officer and a veteran of aviation safety agencies dating back into the 1940s . " BUT WE MAKE our findings public , and , boy , how we make them public , " he said . " We have really tweaked a few noses in this town . " NTSB officials are proud of the fact that , unlike the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , and letters from the safety board to federal regulatory agencies alerting them to unsafe conditions and recommending changes are immediately ? made public . " We get better results by releasing one letter to the press than all the bureaucrats in Washington could by writing thousands of threatening inter-office memos , " said one NTSB official . So , when Kapustin completes his report on the B-25 crash  --  which is believed to have been caused by a massive-engine failure and resulting fire ? and the five-member safety board makes its recommendations , the results will be released immediately to the public . SOMETIMES the howl of indignation can be deafening , as Kapustin discovered after he investigated the Dec. 1 , 1974 , crash of a Trans World Airlines jet atop a Virginia mountaintop and decided that the FAA 's air traffic controllers were partly to blame for allowing the aircraft to descend too low on its approach to Dulles International Airport . The safety board itself split 3 to 2 on the issue  --  three members blaming the pilot , and the other two saying the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional organization loudly defended them . The failure to follow up a recommendation to make sure the regulatory agencies do something can result in a louder outcry , which the safety board discovered in 1974 in one of the rare blots on its record . The furor stemmed from a safety board recommendation that the cargo door latching mechanisms on DC-10 jumbo jets should be redesigned . The recommendation followed an incident over Windsor , Ont. , when the improperly locked cargo door of an American Airlines DC-10 blew out in mid-flight , causing a violent decompression in the cargo hold . Part of the floor of the passenger cabin collapsed into the vacuum that was the cargo hold and severed the plane 's controls . The pilot was able to land safely at Detroit by adroitly steering with the plane 's engines , TILE SAFETY Board report was published and forwarded to the FAA ; which , by federal law , is the only agency that can order a modification of aircraft , For whatever reasons , the FAA failed to issue an airworthiness directive re ( miring the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own internal problems at that time and did not follow up its recommendation . Charles Miller , bead , of the safety board 's Bureau of Aviation Safety , and Richard L. Spears , then the agency 's chief administrator , were locked in a dispute over the role of Miller 's bureau . Nearly two years later , on March 3 , 1974 , the rear cargo door of a Turkish Airlines DC-10 blew out at 10,000. feet , the passenger cabin floor collapsed , the controls went dead , and the plane crashed near ' Paris , killing all 346 on board . ? , Today , Miller , an aviation consultant in , Va. , after retiring from the NTSB , is still critical of the agency . The agency 's staff is competent , he says , but its five-member politically - appointed board is not . " WE DO N'T NEED five safety experts on the board , ' but we do need a few people who know what this business is all about . There is n't a professional safety expert on the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are appointed by the Presidett to - five- year terms at $39,909 a pat , include three lawyers , a retired . Coast Guard captain , and the ? owner of a small commuter airline . . " Their nroblem , " complained one safety board critic , " is that , like lawyers , they try to find a single : ; guilty party for each accident . Many accidents are the result of a long series of misun-. derstandings , mistakes , and miscalculations . " Many transportation experts , including Miller , agree that the appointment last year of Webster B. Todd Jr. , owner of a Princeton , N. J. , commuter airline , to head NTSB is a step in the right direction . " I WAS CONCERNED about the lack of- leadership until Danny ? Todd got in there , " Miller said . The new initiative was evident at the Chicago B-25 crash when Kapustin 's " Go Team " was joined by board member Kay Bailey , vice chairman of the agency . ? The " Go Team " itself is the heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster occurs , the team gets to the scene as quickly as possible  --  by commercial flights , government planes , or even automobile . The results can be impressive . When an engine fell off a National Airlines flight near El Paso , Tex. , in 1974 , NTSB investigators discovered the plane 's exterior toilet drain was leaking a blue flushing liquid . The liquid froze in the high altitude , a piece of " blue ice " broke off and fell into the engine , causing the engine to stop suddenly . The strain caused it to break away from Its mount , THE SAFETY board recommended that the toilet drain equipment be modified On all Boeing 727 aircraft . The board got its start in 1940 as the Civil Aeronautics Board 's Bureau of Safety , but was separated from the CAB in ' 1968 as a quasi-independent arm of the newly created U. S. Department of Transportation . However , operating the safety board as a Manch of the Transportation Department it was supposed to criticize did not work well , and in 1974 Congress authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
