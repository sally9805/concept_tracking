txt Mayor Lindsay yesterday ? adopted a ** city operating budget , abandoning his request for new taxes , but warning of impending layoffs of an undisclosed number of city employes and the continued loss in Police , Fire and Sanitation Department strength . Mr. Lindsay , caught in a tax revolt by both the Board of Estimate and City Council , which spurned his requests for new property taxes , for final action on a budget that rtpresents one of the smallest percentage increases in the city 's recent history ? 9.3-per cent over the present $8.6-billion budget The new budget will be $600-million below the $10 ? billion " skin-tight , " " hold-theline " budget originally submitted by the Mayor . ' Tightest Restrictions ' In addition to layoffs , the new budget will require continued attrition  --  the nonreplacement of city employes who leave jobs through death , Hall meeting with his top " This budget Imposes the tightest restrictions on expendi ? , tures , so that for the second consecutive year we will have full attrition in the police , fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline for his action on the budget , which he announced after a two-and-a-half-hour City Hall meeting with his top aides . " This will result in a de ? crease of 3,500 uniformed personnel from these three essential services  --  a condition which will be felt in every neighbor- // hood of our city , " he said . In addition , there will be " substantial attrition " in all other city agencies , except those in which the city will lose matching funds or unique services , Budget Director David A. Grossman explained . Since police , fire and sanitation are totally paid through city funds , reductions in these services save the most money . The Mayor announced that to help offset the need for increased property taxes , he would use $65-million that had been appropriated in this fiscal year for collective-bargaining agreements . This includes $49-million in a contract rejected by the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association and $16-million of $65-million in new city contracts still pending before the Pay Board in Washington . The Mayor indicated that he was using the collective bargaining funds reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to borrow funds to make payments on these contracts . Debt Burden ' Worrisome ' " The fact that we have new bonding capacity does not mean that it is prudent to use it , " Mr. Lindsay said . " The growing burden of long and intermediate city debt is very worrisome . " Mr. Lindsay said he felt , however , that " limited borrowing is superior to the imposition of further property taxes . " However , the Mayor had originally asked Albany for $400-million in additional borrowing power , of which he received $200-million , to help balance the budget . The Mayor 's request for such substantial borrowing powers had underscored the view that he was a lame-duck Mayor whol was not averse to saddling his successor with a debt for cure rent operating expenses  --  a tactic used by his predecessor , former Mayor Robert F. Wagner . The Mayor adopted the budget that had been enacted by the Board of Estimate , which had declined to raise water rates to obtain an additional $35-million in city revenues . Mr. Lindsay took issue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cutting appropriations for collective bargaining and by various bookkeeping devices . ' Absolutely Bogus Cuts ' " We said that these were absolutely bogus cuts at that time , and that is still our contention , " Deputy Mayor Edward K. Hamilton told newsmen . The tax revolt was led on the Board of Estimate by Controller Abraham D. Beame , and some had expected Mr. Lindsay to retaliate by vetoing Mr. Beame 's request for $300,000 to hire 30 additional auditors . Instead , Mr. Lindsay made no vetoes whatever . Because the Mayor did not veto the board 's actions , his adoption of the budget yesterday was the final step in the process of fixing a spending program for the fiscal year that begins July 1 , Mr. Beame noted yesterday that " except for the ' borrow now , pay later ' policy , which only the Mayor can control , and which I oppose as unsound and as an added cost to the taxpayer , the Mayor has adopted the Board of Estimate budget . " Thomas J. Cuite of Brooklyn , the Council majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Finance Committee , said that the new budget " reflects the fact that the Council refused to enact $65-million in real estate taxes . " Lindsay administration officials declined to discuss where any layoffs would occur . They had previously indicated , however , that the Department of Highways would be a major ' target . In previous years , although layoffs had often been threatened , they had failed to , materialize . Costs Put at US-Million " Productivity cuts In personnel and programs will be made to the extent of the additional interest costs incurred by new bonds , " needed to pay for the collective-bargaining agreements , Mr. Lindsay said . Deputy Mayor Hamilton had indicated that the Interest costs would be about $18-million . Mr. Hamilton said that the city hoped to obtain $24-million in new funds to be provided by a Federal welfare program announced last week . He added , however , that he did not want to add these funds to the present budget until they were actually obtained . Mayor Lindsay noted the tortuous route of the budget process , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional state aid , borrowing power and so-called nuisance taxes . The budget was whittled down to $9.42-billion last month when the Mayor met at Gracie Mansion with the Board of Estimate and City Councile leaders . By this time , a $1-billion dif-1 ference between estimated revenue and expenditurs had been ' cut to $100-million , to he financed through $35-million in increased water rates voted by the Board of Estimate and $65-million in increased real-estate taxes to be passed by the City Council . After the board reneged on its part of the agreement , the Council , in a bitter tax revolt , failed to adopt any budget whatever . This still left the Mayor with the option of invoking a charter mandate that would have required the Council to raise real-estate taxes by up to $89-million to balance the budget . Mr. Lindsay yesterday declined to exercise the option . " Four months of public discussion of the city budget have underscored that the City of New York receives far more Scrutiny of its budget proposals than any other unit of government in the country , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted from the separate and often unexpected decisions of Federal , state and city legislative bodies , plus unpredictable actions by Federal and state executives . " 2 Principles Cited The Mayor said that the four-month budget struggle had highlighted two basic principles in budget making . " First , basic amendments are needed in the City Charter to simplify and shorten the budget process . " Second ; while the city leads the state and nation in management reforms , even greater efforts must be made to improve productivity in city operations and to reduce the growth of city expenditures . " The Mayor emphasized , however , that the growth in the city 's ? expenditures " remains well below the national average for localities . "
