PROFIL F. S THE HUMBLEST FRUIT MY grandfather was a country doctor , and in his last years , when I knew him , he liked to talk about his experiences in practice . One story that I remember had to do with a call to a backwoods farmhouse to deliver a baby . It was late afternoon when he got there , and by the time the baby had been horn and bathed and swaddled it was night , and the farmer offered to fix him some supper . My grandfather said he thanked him but declined . " That 's right , " he told me . ' Mut there were some bananas in a bowl On the kitchen table , and I said if he did n't mind I 'd just have one of them . " " A banana ! " I said . I was eight or nine years old , and always ready to eat . " That 's all you wanted for supper , Grandpa  --  just an old banana ? " " No , sir , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . But I was afraid to cat in that house . I was sure it was crawling with germs . It was filthy . It was the dirtiest house I 've ever had to set font in . Those people were worse than hogs . But now I 'll tell you a secret . Bananas are a remarkable fruit . I mean , they are a whole lot more than just good eating . And one of the remarkable things about them is this : They 're safe  --  there is n't anything cleaner than a banana sealed inside its skin . Just be sure that ou peel it y ourself . " ENTHUSIASM for the banana was a characteristic of my grandfa-ther 's generation . His was the first generation in America to become familiarly acquainted with the banana , and it was as much appreciated then as it is taken for granted now . To those who came only a little earlier  --  the generation that grew up just before the Civil War  --  the banana , if it was known at all , was a fruit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pomegranate . Practically all those who did know it then were travellers in the hot and steamy lowlands where it most abundantly grows  --  in South and Central America , in the Caribbean , in West Africa , in Southeast Asia . One of these travellers was the New Orleans-horn concert pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk . Gottschalk , whose compositions include a tribute called " Le Bananier , " became attached to the banana during a long sojourn in Cuba in the eighteen-fifties , and he often mentions it in his autobiographical " Notes of a Pianist " : " ... giving a concert wherever I found a piano , sleeping wherever night overtook me  --  on the grass of the savanna , or under the palm-leaf roof of a veguero with whom I partook of a tortilla , coffee , and banana . " A veguero , hr adds , is a tobacco grower and " king of the savanna , who can live the whole year on exquisite bananas , on savory cocoa . . . and the best tobacco in the world . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana before he discovered it in Cuba . Bananas were now and then seen in New Orleans markets in the eighteen-thirties and forties , when he was growing up there . Traders sailing from Honduras or Costa Rica would sometimes pile a few hunches on deck and hope to make New Orleans before they ripened and spoiled . The other important American ports  --  Philadelphia , New York , Boston  --  were generally considered too distant by even the fastest clipper for even the wildest gamble . As always , however , there was an occasional gambler . The annals of the trade record that in May , 1843 , a New York commission merchant named John Pearsall imported three hundred bunches of the russet variety known as Cuban Red , and sold the lot at a price of twenty-five cents a " finger , " or single banana . That , since Pearsall was a commission merchant , seems to have been merely the wholesale price . Moreover , twenty-five cents had the value then of over two dollars today . The record also notes that some years later a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state too ripe to he sold at any price , and he declared himself a bankrupt . The banana remained an expensive delicacy through most of the nineteenth century . It was one of the curiosities  --  along with the telephone  --  at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 . There bananas were individually wrapped in tinfoil and priced at ten cents ( about fifty cents today . ) . As late as the eighteen-nineties , as the Maine novelist Mary Ellen Chase recalls in her memoir of her childhood , " A Goodly Heritage , " the banana was still for many Americans a novelty and a treat . She particularly remembers the arrival of the Boston supply schooner at her native Blue Hill Bay one autumn afternoon . " Most remarkable of all her goods in those relatively fruitless days were crates of oranges , two kegs of white grapes , packed in sawdust , and  --  most wonderful to relate ! a huge bunch of bananas in a long , slatted frame , " Miss Chase writes . " It may seem impossible today to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that huge frame standing on The Golden Hunter 's deck , hehind those masses of brown , tropical grass , were concealed far more than bananas , delectable and desirable as they were in themselves . Therein among those unripe , green protuberances ... lay a prestige and a pre-eminence among our fellows which in all the years that have passed I have never been able to recapture . My father had bought the bananas as a surprise ... since the price of them in the village store , at least of enough to supply our family , was prohibitive ... and from that day to this I have never been able to regard a hanana with the supercilious stare of the cultivated mind and eye . The munificence and magnanimity of my father , the opulence and distinction of us as a family , remain , always to he evoked by any chance sight of that humblest and ugliest of fruits . " THE ugliness ( to Miss Chase 's otherwise admiring eye ) of the banana must he laid to the genetic hand of God , but its humbleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the United Fruit Company that first achieved a constant , year-round flow of high-quality bananas front Latin America to the North American market , thus transforming the banana almost overnight from a luxury fruit into something approaching a staple . This work was begun in Boston in 1899 with the merger of four variously preoccupied enterprises  --  the Boston Fruit Company , the Tropical Trading &; Transport Company , Ltd. , the Colombian Land Company , and the Snyder Banana Company  --  into a wholly banana-minded United Fruit Company , and it was ( for all practical purposes ) accomplished with the launching of the S.S. Venus , the first refrigerated produce boat in history , in 1903 . In that year , the first of certain record , United Fruit imported from its Latin-American holdings some one and a quarter billion pounds of bananas . At least two-thirds of the ten billion or more pounds of bananas now marketed around the world every year ( including practically all those sold in the United States , Canada , and Western Europe ) are grown in the subtropical crescent of mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , although there have been chauvinistic attempts to prove it so , the banana is not a native of the Western Hemisphere . It came to the West  --  like Christianity , the written word , and smallpox  --  as a gift from the East . Most horticultural historians are satisfied that the banana -- the large , seedless , usually yellow banana of commerce  --  was first developed , uncounted millennia ago , in the rain forests of Southeast Asia . Edgar Anderson , Engelmann Professor of Botany at Washington University , in St. Louis , noted in a study of domesticated plants , " The cultivated forms of the banana certainly originated in cultivation , some of them as hybrids , and the Malay Peninsula seems to be the chief center of origin . " The Roman encyclopedist Pliny ( 23-79 A.D. ) appears to have been the first writer to recognizably describe the banana , and in his catch-al " Historia Naturalis " he ascribes to it an Indian origin . " There is a tree of India ... remarkable for the size and sweetness of its fruit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports . " The leaf of this tree resembles in shape the wing of a bird , being three cubits about five feet in length and two in breadth . It puts forth its fruit from the bark ... a single one containing sufficient to satisfy four persons . " Pliny 's depiction has the further distinction of having given the banana its scientific name . The banana is a member of the botanical genus Musa ( possibly from wiriz , the Arabic for banana ) , and when the eighteenth-century Swedish taxonomist Linnaeus came to classify the common cultivated species , he re-membered Pliny 's allusion to the spar-ing diet of the Indian intellectual and named it Musa sapientum . Musa seems to have brought out the romantic ( or the facetious ) in Linnaeus . There is a medieval legend that the banana , not the apple , was the fruit with which Eve tempted Adam , and the name that Lin-naeus gave to the species of Muse commonly known as the plantain commemorates this pretty story . He called it Musa paradisiaca . The earliest clearly first-hand ob-servation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Yang Fu in the second century . In a compilation called " Record of Strange Things , " he wrote : " Pa-chiao has leaves RS large as mats . One stem hears several tens of fruits . The fruit has a reddish skin like the color of fire , and when peeled the inside is dark . The pulp is edible and very sweet , like honey or sugar . Four or five of these fruits arc enough for a meal . After eating , the flavor lingers on among the teeth . " The toothsome flavor of the banana was probably known only to the peoples of the East until well into the Christian era . Arab traders are usually credited with the introduction of the plant in-to the gardens of the Middle East and Africa , but , considering the dry lands through which it had to travel , its passage must have been a slow one . It is probable , however , that it had completed the first leg of its journey by around the time of Mu-hammad , for there is good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden of Eden is a Muslim invention . At any rate , the Arab historian Masudi , who died in 956 , speaks in his cultural history of the world , " Muruj al-Dhanah , " of a traditional Egyptian confection com-posed of almonds , honey , and bananas . ( The bananas of the Middle East were once of some renown , and one of those who testified to their quality was Benjamin Disraeli . In a letter writ-ten to his sister from Cairo in 1831 , when he was twenty-seven , he ex-claimed , " Oh the delicious fruits that we have here and in Syria ! Orange gardens miles in extent , citrons , limes , pomegranates ; but the most delicious thing in the world is a banana , which is richer than a pineapple . " ) It was also the Arabs who introduced the ba-nana  --  along with the slave trade and the itch for ivory  --  into the immensity of humid black Africa . It immediately flourished there . The Portuguese explorers of the middle fifteenth century found it established as a staple fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra Leone , in Liberia . It was there , moreover , that the banana found its almost universal name . The word " banana " derives , by way of the Portuguese , from a variety of West African languages , in which the fruit was variously known as henna , Nana , ghana , ahnna , f unana , and lananf . The ultimate westward passage of the banana was accomplished in no more than a generation . Sometime in the late fifteenth century , it was carried by the appreciative Portuguese from the Guinea Coast to the Canary Islands . The Spaniards found the banana under intensive cultivation there when they added Tenerife , the largest of the islands , to their infant empire in 1496 . ( Banana cultivation in the Canaries , though dependent upon irrigation , has never slackened , and its plantations are ranked today among the most productive in the world . ) The banana sailed across the Atlantic with the Spanish conquest , and , like the first conquistadors , it first established itself in the larger islands of the Caribbean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemporary witness , the Spanish historian Gonzales Fermindez de Oviedo v Vald6s , who began his career as supervisor of gold smeltings at Santo Domingo in 1514 . " This special kind of fruit , " Oviedo noted in his four-volume " Historia General y Natural de las Indias , Islas y Tierra-Firme del Mar Oceano , " " was brought from the Island of Gran Canaria in the year 1516 by the Reverend Father Friar Tomas de Berlanga , of the Order of Prcdicadores later Bishop of Panama , to this city of Santo Domingo , whence they spread to the other settlements of this island and to all other islands peopled by Christians . And they have even been carried to the mainland , and in every part they have flourished . " THE nature of the banana is as singular as its history and its shape . Its propagation is unlike that of any other fruit . The banana plant is not a tree but a tree-size herb , with a palmlike crown and a fleshy green stalk that can spring from the ground and grow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feet in little more than a year . Its visible stalk is not a stem but a tubular convolution of its unfurling giant leaves , and its apparent root is not a root but a rhizome . This is : L shallow , creeping , tuberous stem that produces a number of progenitive buds , like the eyes of a potato . Much as the potato plant grows from the sprouting seed potato , the banana is grown from planted sections of rhizome . A few weeks after planting , a leaf ) stalk sprouts from the reproductive bud and begins its laborious simulation of a tree . A truer stalk then appears in the form of a shoot that pushes slowly up through the hollow center of the spiralling shaft of leaves . The shoot emerges at the crown of the plant as a flower bud , lengthens , droops , and slowly opens into a dozen cascading clusters of tiny blossoms . It is from these blossoms that the banana 's cornucopia of fruit develops . Each female blossom becomes a single banana , or " finger ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingers becomes a " hand ; " and the whole bouquet becomes the massive bunch , or " stem , " of bananas . The botanically ordained purpose of the banana plant is to produce a hunch of bananas , and when that end is achieved its productive life is over . The cultivated plant is then cut down and a successor shoot takes over . Bananas , like many other kinds of fruit , are always picked in their green , or unripened , state . This is not , however , for reasons of marketing convenience , as is the case with most other fruits and vegetables . Gourmet hearsay to the contrary , a banana is not at its best when freshly picked from the tree . A tree-ripened banana lacks the melting sweetness and velvety texture for which the store-bought banana is relished . Bananas ripen properly only after picking . They must , moreover , be picked at a certain stage of maturity . There is a period , usually set at about three weeks , during which they must be cut in order to ripen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines the moment of cutting . Bananas consigned to the most distant markets are cut on the earliest possible days , for a day , even a few hours , can he important in their fragile market life . Few fruits ( the strawberry , perhaps , and the raspberry ) are more sensitive than the banana to the destructiveness of time . A picked banana begins at once to ripen . The process can not he halted without damage to the fruit , but it can be tactfully retarded . In this respect , the banana might seem to resemble the apple . Apples picked for winter storage can he kept for months in a controlled environment of low temperature ( just above freezing ) and high humidity ( around eighty-five per cent ) , which produces a physiological stasis somewhat like hibernation . But the banana is less accommodating to commerce . A cut banana has a " twilight " life under ideal storage conditions of about six weeks . It must then he allowed ( or encouraged ) to ripen fully , or he discarded . The storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve and maintain a constant temperature in the pulp of the fruit of about fifty-six degrees , a humidity of at least ninety per cent , and a carefully regulated ventilation system , and these arc standard on all banana ships , trains , and trucks . The twilight life of the banana is a curious imitation of life . In his " The Banana : Its History , Cultivation and Place Among Staple Foods , " Philip Keep Reynolds , the classic biographer of the fruit , has noted , " The necessity for infinite care in handling a hunch of bananas will be appreciated when it is realized that this fruit , when harvested , is practically a living organism drawing sustenance from its stalk , with sap flowing and tissues changing ; that in the ripening process it generates heat within itself ; that a few degrees of temperature above or below normal may stimulate too rapid ripening , or cause checked vitality and chill . " The demanding nature of the twilight life of the banana was examined in more detail by Harry W. von Loesecke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a monograph entitled " Bananas : Chemistry , Physiology , Technology . " " The problem of respiration is one of considerable complexity , " he observed . " The fruit continues to respire when removed from the tree , evolving carbon dioxide along with ethylene and probably small amounts of volatile esters . Any condition that radically changes this respiratory activity and thereby alters the normal metabolism of the fruit , will have detrimental effects upon its final quality .... In general , the trend of respiration is an initial steady , relatively low rate for green , unripe fruit , followed by a rapid rise during the early ripening period . The ripe and overripe fruit show a fairly steady , but usually slowly rising rate until the peel becomes completely brown . " It is this stubborn , lifelike respiratory vigor of the cut banana that complicates the immediate , shipboard inhibition of the ripening process . More is required than merely removing the harvested fruit from tropic heat to storage in a properly ordered environment . The several gases emitted by the respiring banana must he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ripening process . The proper environment of cool , moist , circulating air must be established in the storage hays and then meticulously maintained . Refrigeration must be so pitched that it quickly reduces the field heat of the banana and also counteracts the waves of metabolic heat produced by the living , breathing banana . This heat , in the early stages of cooling , can he of some intensity . Reynolds has estimated that a sixty-thousand-pound cargo of bananas will generate about eight million British thermal units per hour . That is about the equivalent in heat production of burning a third of a ton of coal . Bananas arc ripened commercially in much the same way that they are stored for transportation . There is the same control of temperature and humidity , and the same provision of drculating air . The differences are chiefly that the temperature of the pulp is gently raised from the numbing fifty-six degrees to a more animating fifty-eight to sixty-eight , and the natural emanations of the banana are retained and circulated through the ripening room . The most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a versatile unsaturated hydrocarbon that occurs in illuminating gas and was once widely used as a general anesthetic in surgery . Its capacity for stimulating the ripening process in bananas ( and also in such other produce . as tomatoes , apples , and pineapples ) is another aspect of its powerful personality . The discovery of ethylene as a natural product of banana metabolism and the demonstration of its role as an autocatalyst - ' in ripening occurred in the late nineteen-twenties , and it was subsequently found that a more precise control of the process could be gained by the use of additional ethylene . A brief exposure of the fruit to ethylene ( in a ratio of one cubic foot of gas to every thousand cubic feet of room space ) at the start of the ripening process is now standard practice in the trade . Five commercial-ripening schedules , ranging from four to eight days , are in common use .. The shorter the schedule the greater the . heat required to bring the fruit to the wanted state of maturity , and the more leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not brought to actual eating ripeness in the ripening room . That would limit their shelf life too severely . They are ripened to the edge of a color state called No 4 in the trade  --  in which the original grassy-greenness of the peel has been replaced by a preponderance of yellow . The fruit is then quickly moved to market and continues its ripening on the shelf . At this stage , a banana has about a week of more or less edible life . The lingering green of No. 4 becomes in No. 5 ) a mere touch of green at the tips , and that gives way ( in No. 6 ) to an entirely yellow skin . This is followed by the telltale freckling of the final stage ( No. 7 ) of generally acceptable ripeness . Most people ( forty per cent ) prefer bananas in the green-tip stage , according to a United Fruit Company survey . The second-Iargest group in the study ( thirty-two per cent favored a fully yellow banana , and the next ( seventeen per cent ) the greenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred the fully ripened No. 7 banana . The remaining four per cent were people who ate only cooked bananas , and so bought only green or greenish fruit . THE United States consumes more bananas than any other country in the world , and Americans eat more bananas than any other Fresh , or unprocessed , fruit . Apples and oranges and grapes , though all of great commercial importance , are now increasingly marketed as cider ( or applesauce , apple jelly , apple juice ) , as frozen orange concentrate , and as wine . n 197 , according to records compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture , Americans ate some four billion one hundred and forty million pounds of bananas  --  an average of upward of eighteen pounds per person and all those bananas ( except for a trifling few processed for baby food ) were bought fresh . The banana is popular primarily because almost everybody likes its delicate , unassertive flavor . ( Simone Beck , the great French cook and collaborator of Julia Child , observed in her recent culinary memoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of bananas as my husband is of chocolate . Just as my husband has a chocolate dessert every night , Paul Child has a banana for breakfast . " ) But there are other reasons for the popularity of the banana . Bananas are always and everywhere in season ( at Denny 's Market in Stapleton , Nebraska , and on the breakfast menu of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston ) , and they are always ( even at the Ritz ) the least expensive of fruit . Bananas are , in fact , among the least expensive of foods . At around nineteen cents a pound , they are cheaper than rice ( thirty-six cents a pound ) or potatoes ( twenty-four cents a pound ) or dried black beans ( thirty-seven cents a pound ) , or even the cheapest supermarket bread . Nevertheless , for all its great and growing popularity , the banana has few genuine admirers . The enthusiasm of its Gottschalks and Disraelis and Chases faded with the proletarian abundance of the twentieth-century banana . Such proprietary ardor is now reserved for the avocado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The banana , unlike the grapefruit , or even the commonplace apple , has never been a selection of the Fruit-of-the-Month Club . Its place in current American culture is very much like that of the hot dog and the hamburger . Everybody likes the banana , but nobody takes it seriously . Indeed  --  afte ? fifty years of show-biz songs ( " I Like Bananas Cause They Ai n't Got No Bones " and , of course , " Ytsl We Have No Bananas " ) and jokes ( " You may he a fine , upstanding citizen , but that makes no difference to a banana peel " ) and sight gags ( Harpo Marx peeling a zippered banana ) and street talk " She 's driving him banarlas " ) ? PQ ? - ple are much more inclined to take it with the utmost lack of seriousness , as the Alfred E. Neuman , the Keystone Cops and custard pie , the Top Banana of fruit . About the only people ( other than the United Fruit Company and the equally banana-minded Standard Fruit &; Steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and nutritionists . The latter are inclined to take it very seriously . They know it to he a fond of infinite usefulness in a variety of settings  --  in the nursery and in the nursing home , in the sickroom and in the obesity clinic , on the snack bar and at the training table . THE edible portion of a ripe banana of average size is considered to weigh one hundred grams or a little over three ounces ) and to contain about eighty-five calories . Three-fourths of its weight ( seventy-four and tight-tenths grams ) is water , and most of the rest ( twenty-two and two-tenths grams ) is carbohydrate . Its other components arc protein ( one and one-tenth grams ) , ash ( eight-tenths of a gram ) , crude fibre ( six-tenths of a gram ) , fat ( two-tenths of a gram ) , and vitamins and minerals . The vitamins evolved hi-the banana include A , Br , B2 , Br , C , and niacin , and three of these  --  Vitamin A , Vitamin B5 , and Vitamin Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of minerals . They are especially rich in potassium ( some three hundred to four hundred and fifty milligrams per banana ) and are well endowed with magntsitiin and ph ) sphorns . In addition , they contain useful amounts of calcium , sulphur , manganese , chlorine , incline , copper , zinc , and iron , and a trace ( about half a milligram ) of sodium . Almost everything about the constituent chemistry of the banana is nutritionally salubrious . Even its deficiencies have their salutary side . ( ts low sodium content recommends it for low-sodium diets . Its low fat content recommends it for low-fat diets . Itslow protein content ( combined with its general dietetic blandness ) recommends it for inclusion in the hypoallergenic diet of food-allergy victims undergoing diagnostic tests . And its low caloric value in relation to its hulk ( the standard o n e-h undred-g ram banana has twenty fewer calories than an average serving of cottage cheese ) , together with a high satiety factor produced by its textural density ( which approximates that of an avocado ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quickly satisfying , and wholesome , between-meals snack . It is , however , the positive attributes of the banana that most often and most widely recommend its use : its serviceable complement of vitamins ( whose values , since bananas arc rarely cooked , reach the table undiminished ) , its relative wealth of the essential ( and easily depleted ) element potassium , and , must important , its singular endowment of carbohydrate . The nutritional excellence of the banana is created in the course of the ripening process , and the ripening process is very largely a matter of carbohydrate chemistry . The carbohydrate content of a green banana is approximately twenty-two per cent starch and a fraction of one per cent sugar . Ripening is an enzyme action that reverses this relationship . It converts the starch into sugar and a small quantity of the gelatinating substance known as pectin . A fully ripe banana averages about one per cent starch and twenty-one per cent sugar . Bananas are thus far richer in sugar than apples ( fourteen per cent ) or oranges ( twelve per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other fruit . Banana sugar is a consortium of sucrose , dextrose , and levulosc . Levu-lose and dextrose arc simple sugars and are quickly absorbed , while sucrose is more complicated in structure and more deliberate in action , but analyses have shown all three to be almost entirely utilizable by the human body . The nature and abundance of its sugars ( together with the accompanying pectin and some subtler factors ) render the banana of particular service in the treatment of certain gastro-intestinal disorders . One of these is a wasting diarrhea called celiac disease , which principally afflicts children in the first few years of life . Its immediate manifestation is a hypersensitivity to some element in the gluten of wheat flour and other cereals , and its natural consequence is severe malnutrition . Bananas are among the few broadly nourishing carboliydrate foods well tolerated by celiac patients in the early stages of the disease , and it has been suggested that the fruit may in some way actual ) soften the impact of the disease as well as nourish its victims . The banana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is often the first raw fruit included in the diet of victims of colitis . Bananas are important as a dietary supplement in these diseases because they offer a welcome spectrum of vitamins ( especially A and ( 2 ) , minerals , and easily digestible sugars , but they are even more valuable because they are free from both chemical and mechanical irritants . Some investigators arc inclined to think that the banana may do more than merely not exacerbate the suffering of the peptic-ulcer sufferer . Their studies seem to indicate that an alkaline residue left by the banana gives it an explicit therapeutic power ( much like that of such antacids as aluminum hydroxide ) to hind or buffer the inflaming flow of hydrochloric acid . The banana also has a strong supporting role in the management of diabetes . Diabetics on a regime of protamine-zinc insulin ( or a combination of protamine , zinc , and regular insulin ) are routinely advised to eat a midafternoon or bedtime snack of bananas , usually with cream . This function of the banana is not in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its counterpart . Oranges are uniquely capable of giving an almost instantaneous lift to a sagging blood-sugar level . The banana , with its unique abundance of slowly metabolized sucrose , has the capacity to proide against just such a dangerous sag . The dietetic benevolence of the banana is not confined to the special diets of the sick or the sickly . It is equally beneficial in the daily diet of the well . Nutritionists consider the banana a food for the whole of life . It has , indeed , an almost incomparable span of usefulness . It is often the first solid food in the infant 's diet , it is a food for boys and girls in the nutritionally trying years of adolescence , it is a fond for active youth and sedentary middle age , and it is only too often the last solid food that can be managed by the aged .
