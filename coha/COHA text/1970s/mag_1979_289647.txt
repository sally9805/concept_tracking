Court circus in Geneva <P> It took the twelve-member Swiss jury only 50 minutes to decide the long-pending case , and when acquittal was an nounced the Geneva courtroom erupted in applause . Then a smiling Bernie Cornfeld , 52 , the bearded hustler from Brooklyn who had founded Investors Overseas Services , the bankrupt European-based mutual fund empire , repaired to a near by cafe for a victory celebration . After a four-week trial that even the presiding judge described as a " circus , " Cornfeld was declared innocent of charges that he had coerced employees of I.O.S. into buying its stock when he knew his operation was collapsing . <P> That apparently ended the legal troubles that had dogged Cornfeld for seven years since the fall of I.O.S. , which he started in the 1950s and built into the world 's largest offshore investment com bine . At its peak in the late 1960s , I.O.S. managed assets totaling more than $2 billion in mutual funds alone ; armies of I.O.S. " reps " rang doorbells everywhere to persuade people to put their savings into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cornfeld , a onetime social worker , proclaimed that " everyone can be a millionaire . " As if to prove it , he lived a sybaritic life in a Geneva man sion built by Napoleon , where he was sur rounded by purring cheetahs , freeloading jet-setters and a harem of adolescent beauties . <P> Cornfeld 's fortunes tumbled with the end of the bull market on Wall Street in the late 1960s . I.O.S. shares , which had been going for as much as $25 in mid-1969 , were selling for 400 by late 1970 . <P> The I.O.S. board fired Cornfeld as chair man and called in New Jersey Financier Robert Vesco , who returned the favor by milking the funds of an estimated $227 million . He absconded in 1972 to Costa Rica and later the Bahamas . Angered at the way the I.O.S. shambles had be smirched their reputation for financial probity , the Swiss seized Cornfeld when he returned to the country in 1973 and held him for eleven months while they tried to assemble a case . <P> When it finally came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because many prosecution witnesses ended up praising Bernie ; he had already started reimbursing them for their losses in I.O.S. stock when his bail was cut from $3.1 million to $600,000 . <P> Nowadays , Cornfeld lives quietly in Beverly Hills and dabbles in real estate and movie financing . Acquittal or no , he says , " Geneva is not exactly the object of my affection . "
