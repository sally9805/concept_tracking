WHEN Salvador Allende Gossens was elected President of Chile last year , some nervous Americans with investments there reassured themselves that , although Allende was a Marxist , he had always maintained a healthy respect for the due process of law . That assessment has proved correct , if a bit too sanguine . While giving conscientious attention to democracy and legality , Allende has nonetheless been expropriating American holdings almost as fast as he can . In July , he announced the nationalization of the mining interests of Anaconda , Kennecott and Cerro-but only after a constitutional amendment permitting the takeover had been duly introduced , debated and passed unanimously by the legislature . The amendment also provided for compensation based on the book value of the mines . <P> Last week Allende announced that Chile will deduct $774 million in " excess profits " from the compensation due to Anaconda and Kennecott ( Cerro 's mine began production only last year ) . In effect , that means that the two companies will receive not a penny for their properties . The $774 million figure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated each company 's average worldwide copper profits over the past 15 years as a percentage of its book value and came up with a figure of 10% . Any profits from the company 's Chilean operation that exceeded 10% a year were considered " excessive . " The companies figured differently . <P> <P> " Allende has somehow computed Kennecott 's alleged excess profits over the past 15 years to be more than our total earnings from Chile in that period , " complained Kennecott President Frank Milliken , whose firm has been a particularly good corporate citizen in Chile . Said Anaconda President John Place : " Allende 's accounting theory is nothing more than a thin pretext for confiscation . He 's now contrived to grab the world 's biggest open-pit copper mine Anaconda 's Chuquicamata , plus a second major underground mine , and not pay a dime . " <P> Imperiled Credit . Most U.S. copper men had written off the prospect of compensation long ago . Nationalization is becoming a familiar , if uncomfortable fact of life for American firms in Latin America . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ecuador have seized U.S. holdings . Robert McNamara , president of the World Bank , warned last week that such a trend in developing countries may " seriously imperil " their ability to get credit and may discourage investment in entire regions . <P> A hard-line faction within the Nixon Administration is arguing for retaliation to show that the U.S. is not " soft " on takeovers . Under the 1962 Hickenlooper Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act , the President is required to suspend U.S. foreign aid to countries that expropriate American holdings without compensation . Nixon once threatened to use the amendment against Peru after it seized a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey , but he has never carried out his threat . Some State Department careerists argue that the U.S. should definitely not get tough now because retaliation against a developing nation would drive its leadership to further radicalism .
