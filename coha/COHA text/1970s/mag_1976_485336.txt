The Plough and the Stars ( which opened here at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and is now on tour ) seems to me as fresh and relevant today as at any time since it first appeared in 1926 . I say this to begin with , because I have noticed a tendency on the part of several critics to patronize O'Casey . Few of them state the basis for their reluctance to grant him a high place in the rank of 20th-century dramatists , but I can discern it . O'Casey is not " modern . " He is not intellectual , not metaphysical , not formally innovative , only a genre writer . He maintains his lingering hold on repertory stages , it is implied , by carrying on a tradition of mellifluously racy speech which is the common heritage of the Irish . - All these reservations are shortsighted ; " they miss his contribution to the theatre of our era , his universality . Much serious contemporary writing for the theatre is an exercise in evasion . To achieve the " larger truths " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived and substantial reality of our daily experience has been neglected or shunned as trivial and vulgar . O'Casey 's central theme , in his first three plays particularly , is the tragedy of the ordinary person in times of his-. " torical convulsion . Need it be pointed out That right now , in our " peace and prosperity , " as the politicians say , the earth is trembling and being ravaged in one place , here , in another there , while we wait in disguised apprehension for a world-shattering calamity . The question O'Casey asked , in a cry of anguish , is put by the 15-year-old tubercular tenement child in The Plough and the Stars : " Is there anybody goin ' , Mrs. Clitheroe , with a tither o ' sense ? " O'Casey was a life-affirming prophet , which does not mean an " optimist . " The Plough and the Stars , which along with his autobiography contains his best writing , is an unutterably sad play . The more we laughand we do loud and long  --  the sadder the play becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority who everywhere live for small satisfactions and pleasures  --  are utterly inadequate , feckless and footling in the face of their social and personal destinies . With the city burning , men , women and children ripped apart and dying , we see people ( including the " radical " ) playing cards , indulging in idle talk , shouting boastful slogans of bravery , and running like scalded rats into their various holes of safety . Yet these same people in casual behavior manifest a mutual tenderness one would hardly expect of them . This , while raging at one another as if they were deadly enemies . Bessie Burgess , defiantly sings Rule Britannia among the Irish patriots , loots the shops ( as do most of the others , whatever their political persuasion ) , is the most modestly courageous in helping her adversaries in need , and is killed for her pains . While a uniformed man is rousing the crowd to military zeal in the national struggle , speaking in splendid rhetoric ? " It is a glorious thing to see arms in the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of arms , we must accustom ourselves to the sight of arms , we must accustom ourselves to the use of arms . . . .

" ? a simple housewife hysterically seeking her husband during the street battle in order to fetch him back home says of the soldiers , " I tell you they 're afraid to say they 're afraid . . . . I saw fear glowin ' in all their eyes . " It was a daring thing to picture the hallowed Easter Rising of 1916 in this way : audiences in Dublin rioted at the performances . But O'Casey wrote with utmost compassion . There is a vast and savage humor in his writing as shocking as it is hilarious . It is the laughter of a demon god , irate and pitying . O'Casey 's eloquence , whether in mockery or in condolence , penetrates our marrow .

He is angryout of love . O'Casey is somewhat like the teasing charwoman , Mrs. Gogan , whose reply to every bald assertion is , " She is , an ' she is n't " or " Ah , they do and they do n't . " In the narrow compass of a trumpery event or as the British soldier says at the play 's end , " Ow , it was a little bit of a dawg foight , " O'Casey has achieved an epic statement . There are some flaws in the Abbey Theatre ( Dublin ) production , but they are of little account in the light of the excellence of the whole . I had some trouble making out occasional speeches through the authentic thickness of the accents , but even this is no great matter : the " music " is there and the feeling . A good-sized cast forms a happy ensemble of which Siobhan McKenna ( a marvelous voice and face for Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Angela Newman , John Kavanagh , Clive Geraghty , Bill Foley are especially notable . What is most remarkable is the quiet of the production of a play which could easily be made flagrant. ?
