It should bring relief from U.S. price rises , but not enough to cheer <P> Is it a " sloom , " an oddball mix of slump and boom ? Is it an " excession , " an expansionary recession ? Is it merely a forward retreat ? Whatever the U.S. economy is going through is as much a matter of semantics as statistics . But the confusing numbers will quickly clear up . Even if the economy is not now in a recession , the latest oil price rises by the OPEC cartel further ensure that a downturn will soon begin . <P> That is the view of almost all the experts , including the ten members of TIME 'S Board of Economists . Their unanimous opinion is that 1980 will be a year of middling-size recession . It will bring lower inflation , easier interest rates and higher unemployment , but not so much as to create either tremendous pain or fast , fast , fast relief . <P> The current indicators are as perplexing and contradictory as a set of cooked books . Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did last March ; auto sales are moving like an Ypsilanti car without antifreeze ; and the construction of new houses , the traditional harbinger of economic swings , is down from a rate of 2.1 million a year ago to 1.5 million now . But count the assets : a record 97.6 million Americans are at work in civilian jobs , and their personal income and spending rose rather smartly last month , although many of the gains were the puffy results of inflation . People seem pessimistic about the economy , yet rather confident of their own careers and futures . Many businessmen , their profits climbing and their cash registers jingling , say that if this is a recession let 's have more of it . <P> They will get their wish soon enough . Six members of TIME 'S board* believe that the gross national product will decline this month and keep right on heading down . All of them agree that there will be a fall-off in the first and second quarters of 1980 . A recovery , they figure , will not begin until autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is-or will be-a consequence of inflation and the necessary policies of tight money and higher interest rates that have been adopted to combat it . Last week 's oil boosts will swell inflation still further and bring on more countermeasures . But in the campaign against inflation , TIME 'S economists neither expect nor advocate mandatory wage and price controls . To spur business capital investment , they anticipate that taxes will be cut , if not in 1980 then early in 1981 . As a consequence of recession , they figure that the 1980 budget deficit will be far higher than President Carter predicted only four months ago . Highlights of the board 's daylong meeting last week : <P> RECESSION . The slump should be sharpest early in the new year . During each of the first two quarters , real economic growth-that is , the gross national product adjusted for inflation-is expected to tumble at an annual rate of 4% . In the third quarter , according to the median forecast of the board members , there will be a 1.5% decline .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
