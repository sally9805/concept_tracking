Dee Patterson , 27 , a Chicago teacher , wanted to learn German before she takes a trip to Europe this summer . Olga Howard , 86 , whose family spoke German when she was a child and who lives in Evanston , Ill. , was anxious to teach the language . They both called the Learning Exchange , a service that connects people who want to learn something with people who want to teach it . The women have been meeting once a week ever since , and Mrs. Howard has " high hopes that Dee will be understood when she asks where to check her luggage " upon her arrival in Austria . <P> Some 20,000 other people in the Chicago area have been brought together - free of charge-by the Learning Exchange since it was set up four years ago . Now on the second floor of an Episcopal church in Evanston , the exchange is financed by several small grants from foundations ; it has four full-time staff members , four telephones , and an information bank of 30,000 file cards that list the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2,000 subjects-including such off-beat avocations as fire eating , flying saucers and fox hunting . Says Vice Chairman Denis Detzel : " The calls are an excellent way of keeping track of what people are into . " When former President Nixon went to China , for example , dozens of people called who wanted to learn Chinese . Lately there has been a great demand for courses closer to home : plumbing , carpentry and auto repairs . <P> Some of the teachers listed with the exchange work in the city 's public schools , but many are people who simply want to share their expertise and enthusiasm . For example , Charles Spielman , an aquatic biologist for Chicago 's metropolitan sanitary district , teaches clowning ; David Porter , who is blind and is studying for a master 's degree in social work , teaches several different stringed instruments . Some teach without pay ; others negotiate a fee with their students . Grace Jaffe , a retired sociology professor , teaches French to four teenagers , who tend her vegetable garden in return . Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high school system . " <P> Doctoral Students . The exchange was set up by Detzel , 29 , and Bob Lewis , 34 , former doctoral students at Northwestern University , who wanted to find new ways for talented people to teach outside a traditional classroom . Still dependent on grants , they are moving toward financial independence by selling memberships for $15 a year . <P> Word of the exchange 's success has spread ; calls have come in from more than 50 cities in the U.S. and Canada asking for information about learning-exchange systems . Meanwhile , Detzel and Lewis have earned praise from the educational establishment . Says B.J. Chandler , dean of Northwestern 's school of education : " The formal educational system is groaning under the load put on it . We 've got to lend our support to this kind of alternative .
