KAREN DE CROW , a lawyer , the former president of the National Organization for Women , a forceful presence at the Houston Women 's Conference last November , turned forty this winter , and she wrote a piece for the New York Times about how great it felt to be forty and single . " You eat , sleep , make love , watch television , listen to music , go out , come in , read , use the telephone , write , type , talk , work ; sing ? when you want to , " she explained , and then described the nostalgic morning she passed on her birthday , sitting alone at home , " drinking coffee from a cup from marriage No. 1 ( I recently had a charming lunch with my first husband ) , listening to Messiah records from my second marriage ( today I received a warm , newsy birthday card from mother-in-law No. 2 ) . " Karen De Crow characterized her life , her aloneness , as an Eden . Accompanying this rhapsody , which was reprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman leafing through an art magazine while chatting on the telephone ; crowded about her were a bottle of Chablis , a big wedge of chocolate cake , plants , a TV , a copy of The Hite Report ? objects signifying comfort and leisure , the good and the lib. crated life . The illustration brought to mind one of those advertising profiles of the successful young Scotch drinker , or the multifaceted reader of magazines for men , and indeed Karen De Crow 's description of the joys of the single life read like a piece of ad copy ; she even closed with a tag ? " My life , I think I 'll keep her " paraphrasing a Geritol commercial . Karen De Crow , of course , has no product to sell , no toothpaste , no Kentucky Fried , no Fab ; she is peddling , instead , the way she has chosen to live her life , endorsing it as if it were an effective pain-reliever . That she is free from any of those nasty emotional entanglements that might , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , or to use her typewriter , is one of her selling points . " The best technique for selling , " I was once advised by Ernest Dichter , the consultant who is considered the father of image advertising , " is to paint for the customer a total picture of the kind of person he would like to be , and then make him believe your product is a necessary part of that picture . " At the time , Dichter and I were trying to figure out what a desirable image for the potential eater of Bahamanian turtle steaks might be , but his principle is universal , and can be effectively used to sell a way of life or a can of reptile meat . Karen De Crow is painting for the consumer an image , that of herself ; the cup of coffee , the birthday greeting , the strains of the Messiah are details that fill in the picture . What might in a darker moment be considered the wreckage salvaged from a life of false starts and misplaced hopes becomes instead a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle of Chablis testifies to a love of pleasure , or The Hite Report to a healthy interest in sex . The figure in this picture is a familiar one by now : the responsible , financially successful , emotionally mature careerist whose independence is attested to by her living alone . She changes locks , builds bookshelves , travels to exotic climes , enjoys solitude and sensuality ; she , says De Crow of the feminist at Houston . is the real Total Woman , the " new-model Miss America . " Her independence is part of her image and is represented commercially . And yet , just as the consumer of goods , despite all assurances to the contrary ( " the choice is yours ! " et cetera ) , is the passive target of advertisers , so the consumer of the packaged brand of independence , despite all the brave courses in home repair and auto mechanics , is essentially a passive figure , a chooser of " options . " That no Adam has intruded upon De Crow 's Eden permits her not to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the bureaucracies that make possible the modern style of leisure provide her with the security that the old-model Miss America expected from a man . I WAS RANTING ON one day about the shallowness of the De Crow attitude ( for I do not pretend to objectivity in this matter ) with a friend in a restaurant . when I overheard a man at the next table inform his companion that he was " keeping his lifestyle options open . " I think he meant simply that he was looking for a new job , but on hearing that phrase for what seemed like the hundred-thousandth time , I was seized suddenly by a wild desire to hurl my fork across the room at him and shout to the startled diners , " But life is n't a lifestyle , it is life , the thing we are living ! " The notion that one 's life is really a matter of choosing an appropriate style in the same spirit in which one would choose a winter coat is one that could be entertained only by a mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques and its vocabulary , that those assumptions have at last become unconscious , and the ability to live well seems simply a matter of smart shopping . No student of image advertising can fail to be impressed by the smoothness , the wholeness , and the neat salability of the " lifestyle " De Crow is promoting : her " new-model Miss America " has as good a chance for commercial success as the male model that preceded it by a few years . For can we not discern in the portrait of Karen De Crow a feminized rendering of that familiar modern type , the follower of the Playboy Philosophy ? This imaginative creed , wherein the tenets of a timeless hedonism are harnessed to serve the ends of a consumer culture , is attended by all kinds of clever justifications , which assure the adherent that , by thinking of his own needs first , he will somehow benefit mankind in the long run . This baroque blend of the concept of Karma and self-righteous social Darwinism works with particular neatness in the De Crow scheme of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside those of advertising . Have not women remained oppressed lo these many years by having always to consider first the needs of others ? And should they not therefore proceed to set things right by thrusting their own desires forward ? The image De Crow offers to us is not simply that of a happy woman , but also that of a good one , the modern portrait of Virtue Rewarded . Underlying the Playboy Philosophy has always been the image of life as a vast smorgasbord , from which one is free to pick and try little tastes of this and that without ever having to settle upon a main course . Now this image is very nice as a marketing ploy , since it encourages the customer to sample a variety of products in his quest for the " lifestyle " that is most truly " him , " but one wonders if it is not perhaps a bit unrealistic to imagine that one can nibble at marriage or motherhood as one would at green beans , sampling and savoring and then moving on to the eggplant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crow 's cheery recollections of charming lunches with " husband No. 1 " would seem to indicate that she , at least , has mastered the trick of moving from one course to the next without experiencing any kind of emotional indigestion ; but one may be forgiven for asking if she has not had to pay some kind of price along the way . That there always is a price , a cost , when one leaves one thing behind for another is a law of existence that thinking in terms of lifestyles " and options enables one to forget : at a smorgasbord there are always other choices ; when shopping , one can usually make an exchange . Not having to recognize that there is a price encourages the illusion that life is , or at least should be , a smooth affair , that if things do n't go right , somebody should do something about it . Karen De Crow writes of the " lifestyle " that she has chosen , and of what is being called these days " the spirit of Houston , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independence : and yet , despite the display of such made at the conference ? despite the torches , relays , marathons , floor fights , the talk of getting tough and hanging together ? what happened there was rather more remarkable for having given cognizance to a new spirit of passive dependence , one in which a bureaucracy takes the place once filled by a man . HE WOMEN 'S CONFERENCE at Houston was given a man-date by the federal govern-ment to " identify barriers that prevent women from participating ful-ly and equally in all aspects of national life " ? barriers , presumably , to wom-en 's liberty . What , then , did the con-ference resolve upon , what did it rec-ommend ? Aside from advocating pas-sage of the Equal Rights Amendment , something that would directly pro-hibit restrictions on liberty , most of what the newsweeklies called the " hot issues " were those that , if enacted , would bring the government into the lives of women in a pervasive way ? in an attempt , perhaps , to fill some void in the Adamless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that laws pro-hibiting a woman 's right to have an abortion have been struck down ? an impediment to liberty removed ? " re-productive freedom " has been rede-fined by the conference delegates as the right to hold the government financial-ly responsible for one 's condition . Whereas a few years ago a girl who got pregnant was often forced ? by eco-nomic circumstance and the tradition of blame which flourishes everywhere among the oppressed ? to beg the man she believed was responsible for $500 to help her out of her condition , the " new-model Miss America , " continuing in that habit of dependence , would register instead her indignant cry of alarm to the local Federal Abortion Aid Center or some such , along with a demand for that same old $500 . Not having an appropriate bureaucracy to which one P may turn for help is presumably interpreted as a " barrier " to participating fully in the life of the nation . It is almost as if women , knowing that so much of the federal budget is being allocated for defense ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized upon the bright idea of creating a kind of alternate bureaucracy of domestic economy to parallel that of war , one complete with its own council to dispense funds for such domestic concerns as the daily care of children , " reproductive freedom , " and ( perhaps in a bizarre mimicry of the national policy of offering huge sums in " reparation " to countries we have bombed and destroyed ) the compensation and consolation of rape victims . To argue that women , if they can not get public funds , will not get the abortion that will benefit not only themselves but also society by sparing it unwanted and burdensome souls , is of course to miss the main point : that to look to a bureaucracy to solve personal problems is to continue with the habit of passive dependency , to continue thinking , assuming , hoping that somebody will be there to clean up the mess . Since making the federal government one 's intimate in the aftermath of one 's rape can hardly be considered the removal of a barrier , an " external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston sought was not really liberty but power , for , Women , it might be beautifully argued , have been like still-lying stones , or creatures chained to their sickbeds , who are now seeking to win and use power in the world ; and yet one questions the way in which " power " was interpreted at Houston . Delegates to conferences are almost by definition quasi-political types , and since quasi-political types are always on the lookout to create new jobs for themselves , it should not surprise us when a conference recommends solutions that will produce jobs for the conferees . And yet to dismiss what happened with a cynical nod at the inevitability of self-interest is again to miss the deeper point , that in the world of Karen De Crow the government is the new Mr. Right . Exchanging one mode of dependence for another is not wrong , of course , but one must understand that what is taking place is less a revolution than a change in fashion . The adherent of the Playboy Philosophy , the inhabitant of the Marina del Rey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic state , since his marvelous ability to " switch lifestyle options " precludes his ever being a square peg . Women , formerly encumbered by having to place their concern for others first , were natural square pegs ; but once they 've learned to master the trick of enjoying charming luncheons with former husbands , they 'll find themselves able to fit more smoothly into the carved holes that await them . That they may not have won any new liberties or gained any more real power will be of little regard . For them , being able to rely on an abstraction like the government for the solutions to daily problems , rather than having to work things out messily with another human being , their illusion of independence will be easily-fostered and sustained .
