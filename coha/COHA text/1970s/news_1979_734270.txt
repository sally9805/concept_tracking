txt SHE ARRIVES at - work fashionably dressed . When she unlocks the door to . her cramped headquarters in the building 's basement , she checks her wristwatch . It 's 8 a.m . There is no one else around . She hangs up her coat . Next she slips out of her shoes and into low-heeled red canvas slingbacks . Comfort is a priority of her job . Then she strips down to her slip and dons a gold smock . She wheels out a red wooden supply cart , opens one of its drawers , pulls out a transistor radio and switches it on to an easy listening music station . Alice Hargrave is ready to begin her caretaking . She proceeds to the first of 68 rooms . THERE ARE No linens to change , wastepaper baskets to empty , or sinks to scrub . This is not a hotel , motel , or hospital ; in fact , nobody lives here . To describe the rooms as being the size of postage stamps is not much of an exaggeration . When Hargrave dusts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps the floor it 's probably with a tiny sable paintbrush . If she is replacing a flower in a bouquet , tweezers are her tools . The parameters of Hargrave 's work world are minuscule , and she has gotten . used to the idea of thinking small . Even so , as the custodian of the Art Institute 's Thorne Rooms , Hargrave admits she often feels " like an elephant " as she moves about . THE ENGLISH and American miniature rooms , designed by Mrs. James Ward Thorne beginning in 1930 , are onetwelfth actual size . They are considered works of art because they record a history of interior design from 1300 to 1940 in magnificent detail and authenticity . But the precious , tiny interiors are not immune to dust , which accumulates on the Wedgwood jasperware , porcelains , candelabras , sconces , knickknacks , and paintings . Soot settles on parquet floors , marbletopped commodes , and finely woven Ori // Cleaning tiny rooms is a giant-sized task // ental rugs , on velvet and brocade upholstery , and on drapes . Intricately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARGRAVE makes her daily three-hour rounds , illustrated catalogues at hand to ensure everything is in placel , brushes three are in her pocket , cloths , and cleaning and polishing aids ready to be pressed into service . First she inspects the lights " as many as six or eight bulbs need changing daily ; you really have to know the rooms to determine whether an area is dark " . She records the room numbers for electricity department personnel who soon will replace the burned-out lights . Next she surveys each room , scanning for specks and smudges on floors and furniture , noting any fallen objects " flower vases actually come off tables ; it 's startling sometimes  --  it 's as though little ghosts were in the rooms " , carefully scrutinizing silver , windows , chandeliers , noting " that little bench back there " that 's not straight . She is meticulous . " I like to make the rooms ready for the king and queen to come . Maybe I 'm a little more particular . " DURING INSPECTION and routine dusting , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior glass , she 'll carefully make whatever adjustments are necessary . Sometimes Hargrave peeks behind the scenes  --  beyond windows to gardens and cities  --  by marching through a maze of wires and bulbs housed in alleys of plywood boxes directly behind the interiors , sometimes climbing up stepladders to peer in ( " one does n't wear one 's best stockings " J. Vibrations from the air conditioning or the train the Illinois Central runs under part ( f the museum upset some of the scrupulously planned layouts . " One of the tapestries which was fluttering in the breeze of air conditioning now is in the textile department having a great big rip repaired . " As time permits Hargrave attends to restoring foliage dried out by lights , replacing faded wallpaper and - some pretty rotten fruit , " shipping out furniture for reupholstery . At times entire rooms are overhauled . She settles into her office and under a small lamp with the aid of a magnifying lens , she douses in vinegar the dulled crystal beads from chandeliers . until they begin to sparkle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been removed or broken are stored in small boxes labeled according to room and stashed in her desk drawers : Fruit from A-20 , a cat from E-5 : a red counter from a backgammon set ; a box of ashes ; a drawer of unknown origin ; books ; candles ; extra beads ; a spare pendulum for a clock in A-18 ; a piece from a mirror in A-10 ; a cherry pie , actually baked with dough . Hargrave also keeps current a file of each room , which contains original drawings , blueprints , and pencil sketches on tissues . And she maintains scrapbooks of newspaper and magazine clippings . Hargrave collects the daily batch of Column 1 written comments from those who promenade through the miniature rooms . Generally , picture postcard thank-yous are mailed back to those who leave their addresses . HARGRAVE 'S FASCINATION with miniatures began long before she became custodian of the Thome Rooms . " I 've always loved miniatures . I grew up in a family of collectors . We used to go antiquing in Winnetka . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny glass animals , cups . and tea sets . Her former mother-in-law , Colleen Moore of miniature dollhouse fame , was a good friend of Mrs. Thome . and Hargrave is the proud owner of two Thorne rooms . " I became sort of accustomed to doing things on a small scale . And I got into designing fine needlepoint. " she said . Last year Hargrave was asked to fashion a small tapestry rug for one of the Thorne miniatures in conjunction with work she was doing for the Needlework and Textile Guild . She stitched the needlepoint in 24-mesh canvas and presented it to Aliee Anderegg , who had the job of custodian , officially called the technical assistant , at the time . " I asked at one point if she 'd ever mind if I came down and played , observed . " Anderegg was delighted , and Hargrave started dropping in on a weekly basis . WHEN the former Thome Room custodian went to Europe last September , Hargrave .. who had been a volunteer worker there , minded the miniatures . Hargrave was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because her husband 's job transferred him out of state . An " absolutely astounded " Hargrave officially went on the payroll in December . At first she was intimidated. - My fingers are very agile , but I was scared to death working with them . I thought I would lose something . The base of one tureen bottom was a dime . There was a penny tray . It took me 20 minutes to set up a tea set once , and 10 minutes to set up a doll which was askew on a chair . You have to work with tweezers to move something just a hair . Your fingers ca n't do it . " She is still making discoveries . " It 's great to explore and find sofas with little casters the size of pinheads , wicks made from tiny toothpicks , little drawers that open up . and lo and behold , sometimes there 's something inside , Oh , this is interesting . Look . There 's a picture hook up there . I wonder what used to hang here . " IF HARGRAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casual attitude of others towards her tiny treasures . " Children think the rooms are dollhouses . They gallop through . and realize if they shake the railing lin front of the glass , they can get the stuff inside to move . That upsets me tremendously . " " I do n't express my enthusiasm enough " about her work , she says .
