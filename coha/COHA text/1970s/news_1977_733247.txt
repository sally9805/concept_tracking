txt Morris Berthold Abram remembers that it had been very warm that summer day four years ago . He had just turned 55 years of age , was in seemingly fine health and was enjoying a lucrative law . vractice in Manhattan . Sometime during the morning , ? his physician , Dr. Hyman Ashman , called to report ow his blood tests . " I remember how ominous he sounded , " Mr. Abram. recalls . " He said could I come to see him that evening . Almost immediately that ' dread word ' leukemia ' struggled out of my imagination . ' It is leukemia , is n't it ? ' I said to him . " That evening , pr . Ashman confirmed Mr : Abram 's fear . Further tests showed that he had contracted acute myelocytic leukemia , a disease affecting the cells in the bone marrow that form white blood corpuscles . Patients . have been known to die in a week to 10 days after diagnosis . " Despair was written all over his face , " Mr. Abram said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . " He indicated , that very little could be done about it , and he did not offer me any kind of life raft . " It is now four years later , . and Morris Abram 's . leukemia is in remission . Physicians say his case is unusual because patients with this disease generally do not survive this long . Mr. Abram , former chairman of . the Moreland Act Commission on Nursing Homes and former president of Brandeis University , attributes his survival to his own determination to live and to the extraordinary treatment formulated by a team of physicians led by Dr. James F. Holland of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of ? New York . This treatment consisted of chemotherapy , in which remission  --  a condition in 4/ riich evidence of the disease disapReproduced with permission of the copyright owner . pears  --  was induced by , the combination ' of two drugs , cytosine arabinoside ' and daunorubicin , and then was maintained with anti-leukemic drugs . In additIon , til. ' lions of leukemic cells were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called neuraminidase end were then injected ? into Mr. Abram. to stimulate immunity against the disease . And finally , the physicians also used a drug called MER , methanol extract residue , which was used in his case , Mr. Abram said , with special permission from the Federal Government because it is not an established drug on the American market and had to be imported from Israel . " I resolved that , In my case , the disease was not going to be fatal , " Mr. Abram said . " I was not going to give in , and I firmly resolved to defeat the disease , even though I had been told by my physician that there was no hope , or very little of it . " The fact that Mr. Abram had contracted leukemia had been known only to his immediate family and a few close friends and associates . Now he feels his story might give strength to others . A New York Times reporter interviewed Mr. Abram several times during the last few weeks at his home at 15 West 81st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abram 's physicians acknowledge that his treatment was unusual . They say that if the remission continues , as they now expect it to , they will discontinue treatment after the five-year mark next summer . Leukemia , a form of cancer made up of abnormal white blood corpuscles , is generally considered fatal , killing thousands of men , women and children in the United States each year . " It was devastating when the leukemia was diagnosed , " Mr. Abram said . " I sought the best medical team . " ' Desperate to Live ' This group consisted of Dr. Louis Wasserman and Dr. Janet Cuttner of the hematology department at Mount Sinai and Dr. Holland , who is the chairman of the department of neoplastic diseases at the medical school . ? Dr. Holland , coincidentally , was the head of a worldwide group of physicians involved in leukemia work and thus he was in touch with a network of researchers in such countries as the Soviet Union , Israel and France . " T gave permission for every kind of experimental treatment ever devised ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The therapy prescribed was radical . and three-and-a-half weeks after it began , the leukemia went into remission . Then began a ? painful course of maintenance through chemotherapy . Contracted Hepatitis At this point , however , Mr. Abram contracted hepatitis , which his physicians said was probably the result of the many blood transfusions ' needed during the radical chemotherapy . Meanwhile , Dr. Holland had been joined on . the Abram team by Dr. George Bekesi , professor of neoplastic diseases and chief of immunology at Mount Sinai , and by Dr. David Weiss of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . Mr. Abram 's physicians had by now also prescribed the MER drug as part of his treatment . This drug was developed by Dr. Weiss and is a general rather . than specific immunological stimulant . The problem , however , was that the drug had not been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration for use in this country . So , Mr. Abram said , he got In touch with a longtime friend , Senator Henry Jackson , Democrat of Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government far the drug to be imported and used in his treatment . Senator Jackson then persuaded the appropriate officials to review the matter and permission was finally obtained . Mr. Abram was among the Hitt persons in this country to be treated with MER , and the drug was discontinued in his case some months ago because his physicians had determined that he had reached a high level of saturation . Mr. Abram now receives the neuraminidase-treated cells once a , month and every other month he must undergo a varying course of chemotherapy . Mr. Abram says that the trauma of the illness and the painful treatment period have altered his view of life . " I now savor every minute  --  every experience is intensified , " he said . " My devotion to the people I love and to my work is magnified . I am relishing every minute of this new lease on life . " They are crowded minutes . Senior Partner in Law Firm He is a senior partner in the New York law firm of Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of his release from the hospital in October of 1973 , Mr. Abram resumed his active trial practice in courts across the country . In the last seven months , for example , he has been lead counsel in cases tried in Boston , Hartford and Miami as well as in New York . In the time since he contracted leukemia , Mr. Abram also served as chairman of the Moreland Commission , which investigated allegations of widespread corruption and abuse in the nursing-home business . The evidence subsequently helped to convict such owners of nursing homes as Bernard Bergman and also led to the enactment of legislative reforms . Mr. Abram is currently chairman of the board of the United Negro College Fund , which raises $13 million each year for 41 predominantly black colleges around the country . He is also chairman of the board of Yeshiva University 's Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School .

He is honorary president of the American Jewish Committee and a trustee of the Twentieth Century Fund , which is involved in scholarly research and publication in economics and public policy . " I have resigned from many boards on which I formerly served because I wish to conserve my time and spend more of it with my wife , Carlyn , my five children and two grandchildren , " Mr. Abram said . In the last four years , his family life has intensified . Mrs. Abram supports this view . " We relish the simplest pleasures ? living on a conscious level with a perspective most people become aware of only when it 's too late , " she said . The children often visit . Mr. Abram 's oldest daughter , Ruth Teitelbaum ; her husband , Herbert , and their two children drop in frequently . So do Morris Jr .

About two months ago , Carlyn Abram , who is an artist , gathered some of Mr. Abram 's friends to celebrate what he insisted was his 39th birthday . " Some of my former Atlanta law partners came up to roast me in poetry and song , " Mr. Abram recalled . " I thought my family would defend me , but , like my Yankee friends , they joined in the attack . " " When our family is together , the conversations are often issue-oriented , " Mr. Abram observes . " But the boys and I always play a lot  --  tennis , baseball and touch football . I began to ski when Joshua flatly said to me : ' You will learn to ski '  --  and I did . I play tennis when I feel like it . " My game is relentless , provided my hemoglobin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess this comes from not having had a lesson . When I was a kid in Fitzgerald , Ga. , there was no pro and the one tennis court was a potted court on which the lines were frequently drawn with a stick and infrequently marked by lime . " The sporting life , however , is not that different for Mr. Abram today from what it was before he contracted leukemia . But the disease has meant other substantial changes in his life . " I used to go out to a lot of dinners ? I suppose one can go out every night in New York City , " Mr. Abram said . " But I pretty much restrict this kind of life now , preferring to be at home with the family or to read . I also require a great deal of sleep and rest . " " Formerly , " Mr. Abram continued , " I could get by on six hours a night . Now it takes between eight and nine hours . But given rest and interesting activities and challenging cases , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " None of these activities , he emphasized often in the interviews , would have been possible without the unusual treatment he went through . Mr. Abram acknowledges that the treatment was " extremely expensive . " " I have been fortunate because I make a damn good living , " he said , alluding to the fact that for many people this sort of extraordinary medical assistance would be beyond financial reach . He is trimmer now than he was four years ago , but his appearance is not gaunt . Many leukemia patients tend to have a pallor but in Mr. Abram 's case he is tanned from many hours in the sun . What now ? " Before I got a clean bill of health from my doctors , I had to face the possibility of dying , " Mr. Abram said . " But I 'm not now afraid of death .
