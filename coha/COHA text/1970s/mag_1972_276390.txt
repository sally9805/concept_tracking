The decision was a very difficult one for Israel 's High Court of Justice . Meyer Lansky , 70 , the reputed financial wizard of the U.S. underworld , had been living quietly in Israel for 26 months on a visitor 's visa as a " retired business man , " and had applied for Israeli citizenship . Was he entitled to claim automatic citizenship , like every other Jew under the " Law of the Return " ? Or should Lansky be excluded under a clause in the law that bars Jews with criminal pasts who would endanger the public welfare ? Specifically , should two minor convictions and pending charges of income tax evasion and contempt of court back home be considered a criminal past ? <P> After lengthy deliberation the high court 's five judges last week unanimously accepted the Israeli government 's view that Lansky was a threat . American authorities had accumulated enough evidence to prove Lansky a criminal , the judges ruled , however minor his actual proven crimes . More than that , wrote Chief Judge Shimon Agranat , a Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the particular phenomenon of organized crime as it has developed in the U.S. has not yet struck root here in Israel . Heaven forbid that we should encourage opening a door for it . " <P> Lansky , whose U.S. passport was revoked after he left the country in 1970 , will receive a laissez-passer from Israel , and reasonable time to find some other country to take him in ( U.S. charges against him are not covered under extradition treaties with Israel ) . If he lingers on , said a government spokes man , " he will be taken to the airport and asked to choose a flight . "
