Campaigning in last year 's national election , Canada 's Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau scorned his Conservative opponents for advocating " rigid and cumbersome " wage and price controls to slow inflation . Last week , in a Nixon-like about-face , Trudeau announced that he will clamp selective controls on the Canadian economy . In a 20-minute nationwide radio and television address , he called for an 8% ceiling on wage increases and a freeze on nearly all prices-they will be permitted to rise only enough to cover increased production costs . To enforce these restraints , an 18-member review board will be created ; it will monitor 1,500 companies and large industrial and public-employee unions , and will have the power to go to court to demand fines and even prison terms for offending corporate and union officials . For political reasons , the Prime Minister refused to use the word controls ; he labeled his plan an " attack on inflation . " But he left little doubt that it is a strict economic policy . Canadians , warned Trudeau , " are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sudden turnaround is a clear admission that the milder medicine he championed during the 1974 election campaign has failed . Although the government has urged business and labor to hold down price and wage hikes voluntarily , inflation in 1975 has run at a discouraging compound annual rate of 12.7% , and government economists have predicted that it could reach 16% by year 's end . Wage increases have averaged almost 19% yearly-twice the U.S. rate-even though more than 7% of the work force is unemployed . Moreover , Canada has been plagued by more work stoppages than any major industrialized country except strike-happy Italy , and experts lately have worried that without controls the situation could grow worse . The postal workers , for example , last week threatened to shut down mail service for the seventh time in two years unless Canada Post gives in to their demand for a 71% pay and benefits hike . Large U.S. corporations with subsidiaries in Canada , such as American Can Co. , have warned that new plants may be built in the U.S. instead of across the border if Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close . Meanwhile , in their zeal to boost profits , many corporations have raised prices of manufactured goods to levels that are dangerously close to being noncompetitive in world markets . As a result , Canada 's drive to export more machinery , electronic equipment and other finished goods-a cornerstone of its economic policy-is faltering . The nation imported $9 billion more in manufactured goods than it exported last year ; that deficit may well climb above $10 billion in 1975.
