Perched on a sloping site across from the main campus , it looks like a giant poker-hand of five concrete slabs , fanning down the hill . After six years of planning and construction , the University of California at Berkeley last week proudly opened its new $4.8 million University Art Museum with all the ritual speeches , plus an exhibition drawn mostly from California collections and modestly entitled " Excellence . " <P> The result is a building of genuine architectural distinction that also poses some provocative suggestions for the shape of museums in the future . Its designers are three San Francisco architects , Mario Ciampi , 63 , Richard Jorasch , 34 , and Ronald Wagner , 31 . Says Ciampi : " We are people willing to trust our irrational side . There was a lot of trusting of instincts in this building . " There was also a bow in the direction of Frank Lloyd Wright 's Guggenheim Museum . As in the Guggenheim , visitors move from level to level in a flow of curving space . But the tyranny Wright imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley . <P> One enters on a middle level and is given choices : up one floor to the permanent display of 45 paintings by Hans Hofmann-a bequest to the museum from his estate-or down to the free exhibition space on areas below . The floors are broken but connected by ramps , so that viewers move slowly downward through a constantly shifting interior , accented by promontories of raw concrete that jut over the halls like ships ' prows . Says Director Peter Selz : " You devise ways and means of installing an exhibit to detain people , to keep them from moving on . Here we made cul-de-sacs and all kinds of things to keep people in front of a painting . " Selz , 51 , who quit his post as a curator of the Museum of Modern Art in 1965 to go to Berkeley , is delighted with the building . " I was so tired of boxlike spaces , " he explains . " Many architects want to create a neutral space and have it evenly illuminated , but I say neutrality can be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
