Helping the poor is one of mankind 's nobler activities , but as with all good works , it can be pursued with excessive zeal . That , at least , seems to be the case in Chicago , where some donors complain that goods they have left clearly marked for pickup by one charitable organization have been pilfered by truck drivers for a rival charity . People have reported that Amvets trucks have picked up clothing left for the Salvation Army . An Amvets official denies that this is being done but says witnesses have seen Salvation Army drivers making off with Amvets bundles . And Goodwill Industries of America , which relies on well-marked collection boxes rather than house-to-house pickups , claims that it gets complaints about both Amvets and Salvation Army drivers taking donations left beside the Goodwill boxes . Amvets Pickup Manager John J. Walsh is properly incensed at any such short cuts to good deeds . " There 's enough out there for all of us , " he contends . " We do n't have to steal from each other .
