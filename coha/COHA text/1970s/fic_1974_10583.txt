" You 're walking with a limp . " There is this wretched habit I have of acquiring the characteristics of other people . I acquire these characteristics indiscriminately , even from people I do n't like . If I am with someone who talks loud and fast and assertively , I will begin talking loud and fast right along with him ( but by no means always assertively ) . If I am with someone who drawls lazily and is from the South or West , I will drawl lazily too and beginspeaking almost as though I were from the South or West , employing authentic regional idioms as though they were part of my own upbringing , and not of someone else 's .

Do I have one ? I always dress well . But no matter what I put on , I alwayshave the disquieting sensation that I am copying somebody ; I can always remind myself of somebody else I know who dresses much that same way . I often feel , therefore , that my clothes are not my own . ( There are times , in fact , when I open one of my closet doors and am struck with astonishmentby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , of course , but , for a moment , it 's as though I had never seen many of them before . ) And I sometimes feel that I would not spend so much time and money and energy chasing around after girls and other women if I were not so frequently in the company of other men who do , or talk as though they wanted to . I 'm still not sure it 's all that much fun ( although I am sure it 's an awful lot of trouble ) . And if I 'm not sure by now , I know I never will be . If I argue with someone who stammers badly , I am in serious trouble ; for I have a slight stammer of my own at times and the conversation soon threatens to disintegrate hopelessly into bursts of meaningless syllables .

( I 'll need three guesses . ) My daughter is not obscene , but her speech is dirty now when she talks to her friends and growing dirty also when she talks to us .

She is not yet sixteen , and I think she is already lost . Her uniquenessis fading . As a child , she seemed to us to be so different from all other children . She does not seem so different anymore . Who is she ? It amuses me in a discouraging way to know I borrow adjectives , nouns , verbs , and short phrases from people I am with and frequently find myself trapped inside their smaller vocabularieslike a hamster in a cage .

I have indeed been with Andy Kagle ; I stop walking with Andy Kagle 's limp ; and I consider prudently if I have not been talking to my wife in a Spanish accent as well , for the girls Kagle and I were with this time were both Cuban and unattractive . They were prostitutes . Nobody likes to call a prostitutea prostitute anymore ( least of all me . They are hookers , hustlers , and call girls ) , but that 's what they were . Prostitutes .

She was not well-educated ; but her skin was smooth ( no pimples , cysts , or sores ) , and her clothes were neat . Her nature was gentle , her manner tender . She wanted to save up enough money to open a beauty parlor . She was friendly and obliging ( they are n't always ) , and wanted to please me . " Do you like to be teased ?

I tell Kagle about these ; all he does is smile . I do n't believe he wants a pretty girl in a lovely apartment . I think he wants a whore . ) I feel unclean . ( I am inevitably repelled by the odor of my undershirt when I put it back on , even though it is my own odor and usually slight .

They are n't pretty or necessary , and they are n't much fun . I do n't think Kagle enjoysit , either ; we have never gone back to the same girls ( althoughwe have gone back to the same sleazy hotels ) . Kagle always pays and charges it to the company as a legitimate business expense . ( One of the things I do enjoy is the idea of fucking the company at the same time . ) I pay for the taxi sometimes and buy the bottle of whiskey he likes to bring along . Once I 'm there I 'm all right ( I fit right in ) ; but once I finish , I want to be gone . Generally , I 'm ready to leave before he is and depart alone .

I never really want to go with him at all . He asks . And I do . I began biting my fingernails pretty much that same way , because someone asked me to . ( Lord knows , it wasn'tp77my idea . I did n't even know people did such things . And I do n't think I was inventive enough to come upon the habit on my own . ) I was in the second half of my first year in elementaryschool , seven years old and already fatherless . ( I do n't remember much about my father . I did not grieve for him when he died ; I acted as though he had not gone , which meant I had to act as though he had not been . I did n't miss him , since I did n't remember him , and I 've never thought about him much . Till times like now . ) All of my friends in the first grade ( I had many friends in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular and I have always succeeded ) began to bite their fingernails the same week , for no better purpose than to exasperate the teacher ( Miss Lamb ; in the second grade , it was Mrs. Wolf . I have an uncanny memory for names and similar petty details ) and their parents and older sisters . ( It originated as a childhood conspiracy . ) " C'm on , bite your nails , " they told me . So I did . I began biting my nails . In a little while , they all stopped . But I did n't . ( They grew up and went away , leaving their bad habit with me . ) I did n't even try ( I know now that I did n't try to stop because I did n't want to and because I understood even then that I would not be able to ) . And for all these years since , I have been nibbling and gnawingaway aggressively , swinishly , and vengefully at my own fingertips , obtaining an enormous satisfaction from these small assaults . ( It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compulsion , vicious , uncouth , and frequently painful , but I like it . And I do n't think , at this stage , that I would want to live without it , and nobody has been able to tell me why . ) And I know now that I will continue chewing away at my fingernails and my surrounding flesh until I die ( or until I have all my teeth pulled and am no longer able to . Ha , ha ) . Even my handwriting is not my own ! I borrowed it ( and never gave it back ) . I actually copied the handwriting I have now from an older boy who used to work with me in the file room of the automobile casualty insurance company and liked to while away the time betweenp78busy periods inventing , practicing , and perfecting a brandnewhandwriting . ( His own was not good enough . ) His name was Tom , or Tommy , depending on who was talking to him or calling for him . He was twenty-one , tall , and very complacentand mature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature about , for in addition to creating a new handwriting , he was laying Marie Jencks , the biggest blonde that our casualty company had to offer . ) He studied art lackadaisicallyin the evening and tended to take things easy during the day while he waited for the army to draft him into World War II . Between chores and errands and smokes in the men 's room , Tom would sit at the desk in the rear of the file room ( out of sight of everyone who went by , for the file room was a cage of cyclone fence that rose from floor to ceiling and jutted right out into the center of the office , where everybody who did pass could look inside at us ) and devote himself industriously to his handwriting . And I would sit beside him at that desk in back , tucked out of sight behind a bank of green metal file cabinets containing indexes by name to the accidentfolders filed by number in the taller banks of larger , greener cabinets standing near the front , to learn and copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always easy work . Tom would experiment tirelesslywith the arcs and slants and curlicues of a capital R or Y or H or J , speaking little , until he had achieved precisely the effect he thought he wanted , and then he would say : " I think that 's it now . " And if he did n't change his mind in a minute or two with a sober shake of his head , I would slide his sheet of paper with the finished product closer to me and set to work learning and practicing that letter , while he moved ahead with the foundations of design for another member of the alphabet . ( Sometimes , with a downcast , disappointed air , he would reverse his judgment about a certain letter after a week or two had elapsed , reject it , and start all over again from scratch . ) Some of the letters were simple , but others proved incalculably hard and took an immeasurably long time . We were a pair of dedicated young calligraphers , hep79and I ( I , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately to satisfy the stewing miseries of our respectively emerging lusts ; for he , like me ( I was to discoverone day entirely by coincidence ) , also had a very hot thing going with one of the women ( girls ? ) in the office ( and here , too , he was way ahead of me . He had big , bossy Mrs. Marie Jencks , of all people , who was twenty-eight and married , and he was already getting in regularly down , of all places , in the storeroom . Wow ! What a mixed-up maelstrom of people , I felt , when I finally found out about all of us , not realizing then , as I do realize now , that the only thing unusualabout any of it was me ) . By the time old Mrs. Yerger was transferred all the way across the company offices into the file room to get us to do more work or clear us out ( even though there was not that much more work to be done . It was Tom , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blank piece of paper in my hand , I could spend all the time I wanted to doing nothing . I spent a great deal of time doing plenty , or trying to , at a corner of that desk underneath the big Western Union clock , very close to Virginia , that pert and witty older girl of twenty-one , who wore her round breasts loose some days even then , knowing they looked fine that way too if the breasts were good , and liked to arch her back and twist her shoulders slowly with a sleepy sigh , just to roll her breasts from side to side for my pleasure or thrust them toward me ) , I had Tom 's handwriting down pat , and I have been using his handwriting ever since . I found out about Tom and Marie Jencks only by coincidenceone day about five weeks before he left the company to go into the army . ( I left the same day he did for a job that I did n't like in a machine shop . ) Mrs. Marie Jencks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) worked in the Personal Injury Department for mild , short Len Lewis , who was head of the Personal Injury Department and who had fallen politely in love , romantically , sexually , idealistically , with my own incorrigible Virginia . ( She encouraged him . ) I was amazed to find out about all of us , especiallyp80amazed about Marie and Tom ( more amazed even than I 'd been to find my big brother on the floor of that wooden coal shed with Billy Foster 's skinny kid sister so many murky years back . Mrs. Marie Jencks was a much bigger catch than Billy Foster 's skinny , buck-toothed kid sister ) . Marie Jencks was one great big whale of a catch , and I was in awe . To me , once I knew about her , she was a fantasy fulfilled ( although for somebody else ) , a luscious , enormous , eye-catching , domineering marvel . ( And I could not stop staring at her . ) She was married . She was tall , blond , and buxom . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although not pretty . Virginia was prettier ) . And she was humping lucky , twenty-one-year-old Tom Johnson whenever she wanted to . ( What a gorgeous spot for lucky twenty-one-year-old Tom Johnson to be in . It gave little seventeen-year-old Bobby Slocum something good to look forward to . ) When Len Lewis was away from his desk , Marie was boss of the whole Personal Injury Department . She was sometimes good-humored , sometimes officious , and I and most of the men and their secretaries who had to deal with her were always a little afraid of her . She was bossy with Tom too ; she bossed him down one floor into the moldering storeroom for cabinets of dead records whenever she felt the urge ; she bossed him right back upstairs when she was through . It was because of that storeroom with its two unshaded bulbs dangling overhead from thick black wires like a pair of staring spiders that I found out about Tom and Marie . ( I had taken the key ; I wanted to meet Virginia ; he needed the key to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that nearly impossible to believe , even though Tom assured me they did it there , and so did Virginia ( once I began talking to her about it ) , and I knew it had to be true . There was no other place but the floor , and that was always dirty . I still could n't picture it all taking place on the desk . There did n't seem room enough for a woman so tall . ( I have since discovered that a thimble is room enough when they really want to , andp81that the planet itself may prove too small when they really do n't . ) There was only one key to the door of the storeroom ( which made the place ideal for just the sort of thing so many of us , it turned out , had on our minds for so much of the normal business day ) , and I would not give it to him . I had already made my own plans for another one of the twoorthree-minute assignations with Virginia to kiss her and feel her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once with a stark , mysterious terror that always seemed to seize her without warning and for which I was never prepared and could not understand . Her face would blanch , her eyes would darken and dart about anxiously like frightened little mice , and she would tear herself away from me , emitting low , wild , angry gasps and whimpers as she fled in panic and bolted back upstairs . By the time I followed , she would be sitting at her desk beneath the big clock again as though nothing had happened , and she would smile and wink at me salaciously exactly as before . I know now that she was more emotional than I thought and at least a little bit insane . I suppose I loved her then but was too naive to recognize it . I thought love felt like something else ) . " Come on , " said Tom . " Gim me the key . " " I ca n't , " I answered . " I need it . " " So do I. " " I need it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm meeting someone there . " " So am I. " " A girl , " he explained . " Me too . " ( I colored with pride , grinning . ) " Who ? " he asked , stepping back to look at me . " Should I tell you ? " " Why not ? I 'm your coach , ai n't I ? Virginia ? " " How do you know ? " " I 'm not blind . And I 'm not deaf . "  | " It shows ? " " It shows right out between your legs whenever you stand there and talk to her . You ought a try taking your hand out of your pocket once in a while so we can all get a good look . I 'd really like to see that . You ought a carry an accident folder in front of you instead just in case you do have an accident . Pow what a property damage case that would be . Are you laying her yet ? " " Not yet . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " She can show you how ! " " How do you know ? " I asked jealously . " I can tell . Just do it , that 's the best way to learn how . Do n't think about it .

" " Tell me who it is . " " Will you keep it quiet ? " " Virginia ? " ( I felt another pang of jealousy . ) " Marie . " " Jencks ? " " You 're screaming . " " Are you laying Marie Jencks ? " " We 're laying each other . Do n't turn around ! She 's looking right at us , waiting for you to give me the key , so you better do it  --  or she 'll chop your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him with astonishment . " Can I please have the key ? " I relinquished the key obediently , in deference to his superior achievements ; and as soon as he ( then she ) had gone , I hurried excitedly to the old wooden desk underneath the old , big Western Union clock to postpone my own meeting with Virginia and to let her in on what I had just foundp83out . ( She was really the best friend I had in the company , and perhaps anywhere else . On days when I was unaccountablysad and lonely or had no money , she would notice and set right about trying to cheer me up or insist on lending me the two or three dollars I needed until payday , even when she had to borrow it from one of the other girls . ) " Why ? " she wanted to know , when I asked her to meet me on the staircase instead of in the storeroom . " Can you keep a secret ? " " Sure , " she responded brightly . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about Tom . Would you believe that Tom Johnson and  --  " " Of course , " she said . " With " " Sure . " " Right now ? " " The more often the better , I always say . " " In the storeroom ? " " Sometimes they do it in an apartment on Second Avenue . She has a divorced friend who lives there . " " How do you know ? " I demanded . " She tells me . " I was flabbergasted . Virginia 's cheeks were red with delight and her eyes were twinkling with merriment at my expression of amazement . " How do they do it ? " I wanted to know . " Well , she has this thing of hers , and he has this thing of ' his , and he takes his  --  " " I mean down there ! Where do they lie down ? " " On the desk , " she told me . " Have n't you ever tried it ? " " I 'm going to as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are n't . I need a big hotel room . I like to move around a lot . " " You did n't move around so much in that canoe at college , " I reminded her.  | " I was a dope then , " she laughed . " I did n't know I was supposed to . Do you want to know a secret ? " She motioned me closer . " Come around to here so I can whisper and put my knees against you . " Holding a blank slip of paper , I moved around to her side of the desk and began fussing with folders in a tray there , as though hunting for a particular one . As soon as I drew near her , she swung her knees around against my leg and began rubbing me with them methodically , watching me steadily with a knowing , kind of mocking smile . " What 's the secret ? " I asked . " Take your hand out of your pocket . " " Fuck you . " " Okay . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I am . What 's the secret ? " Mrs. Yerger was outside the entrance of the file room ( Mrs. Yerger was always outside the file room ) , observing me balefully . I took my hand out of my pocket , picked up a property damage accident folder , and held it over my hard-on . Virginiasaw , of course , and laughed out loud , showing the tiniest tip of shiny tongue between bright red lips and wet white teeth . Her cheeks were touched with red too  --  they wore them rouged then  --  and she had dimples . I felt the strongest undertow of affection for her , but it was so inadequate ; she was twenty-one , and I was seventeen , and I found myself wishing I were as old as Tom and had a better idea of what to do with her . " Len Lewis and I , " she told me , " meet for drinks anddinner every Thursday night after work . He wants to tellhis wife he wants a divorce , but I wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him the way I do . " I was surprised again , but excited to find this out . Iwas always fascinated by her sex adventures with other men.  | ( She had a fondness for sheer , silky blouses , and I often had an urge to put my hands on her shoulders when she wore one and delicately caress her . When she wore a sweater , I wanted to put my hands inside and squeeze . ) " Do you sleep with him ? " ( I was always greedy for details . ) " He 's afraid . He 's been married all his life and never did anything with anyone else . I feel sorry for him . I do n't know what I 'll say when I finally get him to ask me to . I like him . But I 'm not sure I want to . " I liked Len Lewis too . And I had no doubt that nobody had ever kissed him the way Virginia did , for I had seen him at the office Christmas party with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as old and meek as he was , and much more wrinkled and gray . For that matter , nobody in my whole life had ever kissed me the way she did or touched and fondled me the way she could and did over and over again in the storeroom downstairs or on the staircase between floors . I wanted more and more of her ; I never got all I wanted . She did not like me to do things to her ; she liked to do things to me . We met on the staircasebetween floors several times each working day , where we would kiss and pet and clutch frantically for the few seconds before she always imagined she heard someone comingand bolted away ; or we would meet downstairs in the storeroom for three , four , or five minutes , where she would also pale suddenly and whirl away from me in violent alarm . I was never angry with her when she ran from me , never felt resentful or cheated ; I always felt lucky that I 'd had any of her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so scared . I always wished there were some way I could help . ) She told me once ( more than once , because I kept bringing it up in order to hear about it again ) that in her freshman year at college ( she attended Duke University for two years and never went back after her father killed himself one summer ) she had been laid in a floating canoep86by the backfield star of the varsity football team . I did n't believe her . ( I do n't think I honestly believed then that anybody really got laid , that a boy like me took my thing and put it inside her thing and then went on to do the rest , even though I had seen the drawings and photographs and listened to the dirty jokes and stories . ) She kept asking me to get a room . I did n't know how . I asked Tom how to go about renting a hotel room , and he told me , but even after he told me , I still did n't feel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start beating me up right there in the lobby if I ever tried to register for a hotel room for Virginia and me . And I did n't have the money for something like that . I was only a file clerk . ( I did n't even know how to take her to dinner ! ) I never really made it with her ( I never laid her ) , and I 'm sorry . After Tom and I left the company together , I never went back , and I never saw or spoke to her again . I tried . I 'm sorry . I miss her . I love her . I want her back . I remember her clearly now when I try to remember everythingimportant that ever happened to me . I think of her often as I sit at my desk in my office and have no work for the company I want to do . And I think of her often in the evenings , too , when I sit at home with my wife and my children and the maid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either , biting my nails addictively like a starving hunchback as I slump in a chair in my living room or study and wish for something novel to occur that will keep me awake until bedtime . I liked the fact that she was short and slightly plump ( and wherever my hands fell , there was something full to hold and feel ) . I remember how clear and smooth and bright her skin was ; her dimples deepenedwhen she laughed . She laughed and smiled a lot . I miss that gaiety . Now I would know what to do with her . I want another chance . Then I remember who I am ; I remembershe would still be four years older than I am now , short , overweight , and dumpy , probably , and perhaps some/thing of a talkative bore , which is not the girl I 'm yearning for at all . ( That person is n't here anymore . ) Then I remembershe 's dead . ( She killed herself , too , just like her father . I tried telephoningher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried telephoning her again after I 'd been married a few years . I was already missing her way back then . She was n't there . There was somebody new in charge of Property Damagealso . I spoke to a crippled man in Personal Injury named Ben Zack . " Virginia Markowitz ? " he said . " Oh , no . She killed herself a year and a half ago . She 's not employed here anymore . Did n't you know ? " ) It was after the war , I think , that the struggle really began . So that was where the tin lizzie had already carried us to by then , this industrial revolution , to the third largest automobile casualty insurance company in the whole world , with a coarse , tough-talking , married bleached blonde in Personal Injury ( PI ) and a flirting black-haired girl with thick glasses and very weak eyes in Property Damage ( PD ) , and all of us frying in lechery but poor old Mr. Len Lewis , who was beguiled and fortified by juvenile notions of romance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , he certainlymust be dead . He had nothing left coming to him but those kisses from Virginia . ) It was a pretty tangled ( and funny ) ( and doleful ) situation there in that automobile casualtyinsurance company , and I did n't begin to learn about - post of it until just before Mrs. Yerger came barging into the scene like a hunk of destiny , disguised as new boss of the file room , and scared me out a few weeks later . There were so many startling secrets then that everybody seemed to know but me . Today , I do n't think there 's a single thingp88I might find out about anybody in this whole world that would cause me anything more than mild surprise or momentarydisappointment . Sudden death , though , still shakes me up , particularly when it strikes somebody who has always been in robust health . ( Like my brother . ) Once I did find out about Tom and Marie Jencks , I turned more persistent in my advances to Virginia ; it got me nowhere . ( I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to force her to do . ) The funny thing about each of these women ( girls ? ) ( women ) ( girls ) was that neither one wanted either of us ever to take the initiative . I had much more freedom with Virginia than Tom enjoyed with Marie Jencks ( and got fewer results ) . I could go to her desk beneath the big clock whenever I chose and talk as dirty as I wanted to , or ask her to meet me on the staircase or in the storeroom ; most times she would ; sometimes , with her naughty smile , she would be the one to suggest we meet . But she would never let me force her down onto the desk , although she continued to tempt me far enough to trybefore she broke away from me and fled . ( Why was that ? What was there that made her so frightened with me and not frightened at all with the many older boys and men for whom , she claimed , she did put out and always had ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and me if we ever had gotten together in an apartment or hotel room and had plenty of time , worked out beautifully . ( So what ? ) She would have taught me to go slow . If I did go slow , she might not have become frightened ; and if she did not grow frightened , she would have let me do everything to her and showed me how . But so what ? It would have passed , sooner or later , just as she has passed already , just as I am passing now . ( Fuck her , she 's dead . ) Her case is closed . If she did n't kill herself , she 'd be older than I am now and probably a pest ; she would be stout and wrinkled and suffer from constipation , gallstones , menopause disturbances , and bunioned feet , and I more thanp89likely would not wish to see her . Everything passes . ( That 's what makes it endurable . ) But the memory lives ( but not for long . Ha , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't buried ; and I rememberalso how she used to urge me on after Marie Jencks once she saw me lusting for that baby too . I could not stop thinking about Marie that way after I found out about her and Tom and that desk in the storeroom . ( I used to eat my lunch at that desk two or three times a week and read the sports sections of the New York Daily News and Mirror . ) I wanted her too . I did n't know how to get her . " Bang her , " Virginia would exhort me . " Go get her . " " How ? " " Goose her . " " You 're nuts . " " Grab her by the nipple . " " You 're crazy . " All I could decide to do was keep my eye on Tom and see what he did to get her ; and all he did was nothing . He practiced his handwriting . ( He knew enough to wait and never approach her . ) He sat unperturbed for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited tactfully and patiently for her to summon him into her office by buzzer or telephone or by ordering one of the other file clerks ( it might be me ) to send Tom in . " Are you busy now ? " she would ask . He would answer : " No . " " Get the key , " she would command . And down to the storeroom they would go ( where recordsand folders of people in accidents were crumbling with age in the file cabinets ) . Virginia and I kept track of their comings ( ha , ha ) and goings . She was truly a stupendous catch for a lucky young man to make ( or be made by ) , although I liked Virginiamore ( and so , for that matter , did Tom ) . She seemedp90twice as large as Virginia , four or eight times as much in pure female bulk , that towering , sarcastic , frequently sympatheticbleached blonde of a twenty-eight-year-old married woman in Personal Injury , who looked solicitously after poor little old Len Lewis ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all likelihooddid n't really want to divorce his poor , old , little wife , to whom he had been married all his life and of whom he was probably still very fond ) and did what she could to make his job easier . She was married to a cost accountant with a weak heart ( weakened , probably , by her ) and she bluntly took control of Tom whenever she wanted to and put him to work banging her down in the storeroom or in her divorced friend 's apartment after business hours , in much the same autocratic manner she might use to call him into her office and order him to do some filing . ( Tom never knew when she sent for him the kind of task to which he was going to be put , but he was perfectly willing to take the good with the bad . ) The farthest Tom would ever go toward getting her would be to put himself on display in her office by pretending to hunt for some file . She knew exactly what he was hunting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off immediately , as though in preoccupied continuation of his search for some specific accident folder . Other times she would react as he had hoped , smiling caustically , almost grimacing , and demand : " Is there something in here you want ? " " Yes . " " Get the key . " And down into the storeroom they would go again . " I 'm not even sure she likes me , " Tom confided indifferentlyto me one day in the file room , focusing much more emotion on the capital P 's and Q 's of the handwriting he was practicing than on the statement he was making . " But she sure likes doing it with me. "  |p91I  could not help wondering if she might not like doing it with me . So I tried to seduce her . ( And failed . ) I tried to steal her away from him  --  not steal her away , actually , but merely to get , if I could , my own fair share of that musky , estrous , overpowering , inexhaustibly marvelous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overgrown , rawhonedScotch-Irish brunette from Buffalo with very large pores ) . And I got nowhere . Virginia spurred me on energeticallywith outrageous counsel . " Go give her a fast bang , " she would advise . " She 's dying for it right now . A lady can tell . Walk right into her office and get her . " " How ? " " She 'll be good for you . " " How ? " " Tell her . " " What ? " " What you want . Come right to the point . That 's the best way . " " Oh , sure . " " Grab her by the nipple . Slide your hand up under her dress  --  " " She 'll kill me . " " No , she wo n't . Look Mr. Lewis is out . Go in right now and tell her you 've decided you 'd like to put it to her . " " She 'll lock me up . " " She 'll fall in love with you . You 'll sweep her off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And put me in jail . " " She wo n't be able to resist you . You 're better lookingthan Tommy . And more fun , too . You 've got nice curly hair . " " She 'll tell Len Lewis , or Mrs. Yerger , and have me fired . " " She 'll pull her dress up right there , throw open her armsand legs , and sing : O000000h , come on , baby . Do it to me , like you did to Marie , on Saturday night , Saturd  --  ' "  | " Pull up your dress and sing , " I countered , " if you find me so irresistible . I want to put it to you , too . " " Get a hotel room . " " Marie does it on the desk downstairs . " " Marie 's got a big round ass . " " So 've you . " " I like you , darling , " she declared unexpectedly , looking up straight into my eyes . ( I was almost swept away by surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Even though I 'm smiling now when I say it  --  I do mean it . " I was almost too stunned to reply . " What are you talking about ? " I whispered fiercely . " I wish we were older , " she continued wistfully in a tone close to some boding lament . " That 's what I wish . You know what I wish ? I wish you were old enough to knock me around a little . " I was shocked and terrified , almost enraged with her in my confusion and embarrassment . " Why do you talk like that ? " I demanded indignantly , afraid that something fateful I did not understand and could not cope with was already taking place . " Why do you say things like that to me now ? Right out here in the middle of the office ? " " Because nobody who hears me will believe me , " Virginia continued blithely without lowering her voice or altering her expression of beaming innocence . " Not even you . Not a single person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice get louder and louder steadily until it was almost a shout "  --  her voice rose clearly and deliberately until it was almost a shout and everybody nearby was watching us with amusement  --  " and suddenly called out , I love you , Bobby Slocum ! ' " ( And she had to go and kill herself . Why ? She was no longer an employee of the automobile casualty insurance company because she had committed suicide shortly after the war and was no longer employable . ) " You 're a riot , " I muttered awkwardly with an artificial smile.  | " See ? " she resumed in her normal voice , as all the people around us bent back to their work . " Nobody believes me . Not even you , do you ? " " What do you want ? " I begged of her in bewilderment . " Tell me what to do . Look , Virgin-for-Short , I 'm only seventeenyears old . And I 'm scared . I do n't know what 's going to happen to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now her voice did go soft with a tender care and affection . " We 'll be alone soon in a hotel room , and I 'll do things to you that no girl ever did to you before . I promise . " ( We were never alone in a hotel room . A little while ago in New Orleans , a whore in a nightclubmade that same promise to me in exactly those words , and then had nothing different to offer when she came to my room . ) " Now go get Marie . " " Mrs. Yerger is watching , " I noticed . " She does n't like me , " said Virginia . " She does n't like me , either . " " She does n't like me because I try to have fun with everybody I know . Especially with you . " " I better look busy . " " I 'll keep you busy  --  here . " Virginia wrote the number of an accident folder on a sheet of paper . " Find this accident for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage case with three personal injuries . You can probably get it from Marie Jencks , " she added mischievously . " Yes , Miss Markowitz , " I responded heartily enough for Mrs. Yerger to hear me , and started away briskly . " Oh , and Bobby ! Remember  --  " She beckoned me back to her desk with an important look . In a low voice , she instructed : " Grab her by the nipple . " So , with Virginia goading me on , I set out to seduce Marie Jencks . I tried in the only way I could think of : by loitering . I loitered on her premises for two or three minutes at a timep94whenever Len Lewis was away from his desk and I saw her sitting in their office alone . I lurked and hovered in her view perpetually , pretending to search for accident folders , expecting her to look at me one time and perceive suddenly , in a moment of effulgent revelation , that I had dark curly hair and was a better-looking boy than Tom Johnson and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me also : " Are you busy now ? Get the key . " I never even came close . The most I ever got from her was , " Are you going to spend the rest of your life in here ? " or " Why do you keep staring at me all the time like a moonstruckcow ? " or , shrewdly ( she knew what I was after , all right , the sapient bitch ) , " Is there anything in here you want ? " or , most unkindest cut of all : " You get out of here now . Send Tom in . " And down to the storeroom Tom would go with her again , leaving his handwriting behind in the back of the file room for me to work on alone , and it is his handwriting that I still use . ( I wonder who 's using Marie . ) Tom relied on me to cover for him in case Mrs. Yerger or anyone else came calling for him . And I did . " Tom . " No answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that boy , I wonder . " " Downstairs in the storeroom , Mrs. Yerger , laying Marie Jencks on a desk , " I could fancy myself replying . ) It was pretty hard , I confess , keeping my thoughts on Tom 's handwriting when I knew he was down in the storeroomwith her . Usually , my imagination wandered right down there with him ( and I was more inclined to make dirty drawings of the two of them instead ) . That got to be a pretty steamy meeting place , that gloomy , silent , dingy mausoleum for dead and decaying records on the floor below . Occasionally , someone else in the company would really wish to go there in search of an old accident , and barely miss collid/ing with Tom or me in a new one . It was only one floor down , hut descending the two staircases of that one floor to the musty storeroom was like escaping from scrutiny into some dark , cool , not unpleasant underworld , into the safe and soothing privacy of a deep cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there often , even just to eat my sandwiches alone and read the Mirror and Daily News , or to steal away for a long smoke in the morning or afternoon and meditate over which teams would win the college football games that coming Saturdayor what would eventually become of me and my mother and my brother and sister . ( My brother is dead already : his heart attacked him one day without warning in the waiting room of his business office , and it was all over for him in a - natter of seconds . My mother is dead too . My sister lives far away . We sometimes talk on the telephone . ) I imagine illhumoredMrs . Yerger , who took note of everything , gave that storeroom a very thorough airing once Virginia , Tom , Marie , and I were all gone . I remember also a rape that nearly took place there one lunchtime when Virginia was trapped with me and two older , bigger boys who also worked in the file room . They would not let her out . She had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they would not let her go , they said , until she " took care " of the three of us . Virginia grew nervous quickly . We all kept talking and wisecracking compulsively , as though nothing unusual were occurring . One of them had his arms around her shoulders from behind , seeming to hug her playfully , but actually holding her almost helpless and trying to press her to the floor ; and the other was soon busy with both hands under her skirt , trying to unsnap her stockings and roll her panties down . I watched , with dread and keen anticipation . All of us were breathing heavily ( even I , who was just watching ) . We wore strained , sick , determined smiles and forced husky laughter out between quick commentsin order to sustain for as long as possible the charade that it was all really in fun . It was obviously not in fun . Virginiawas terrified after the first few seconds . Her cheeks werep96chalk white and quivering as she struggled to wrest free . ( I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in my whole life , not even in people I hate . ) Her eyes fell upon mine in wordless panic and appeal . I intervened and let her get away . I was terrified also as I stood up to those two older , bigger boys and insisted they let her go . " Let her go , " I said hesitantly . " She wants you , " one of them said . " Let her go ! " I screamed , with clenched fists . After Virginia had fled , they shook their heads in unbelievingcontempt and told me I was stupid for letting her go just as she was getting ready to put out for the three of us . Was I stupid ? ( I know that by the time we got back upstairs , she was serene and gay again , and not nearly as grateful to me as I took it for granted she would be . And there was no change in her friendliness toward the others . She joked and flirted with them as before , with a show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now . I could n't understand that . I still ca n't . I do wonder , though , what would have happened between her and me if I had kept my mouth shut and joined with the others in making her put out for the three of us . Would she have thought more of me too ? How could she ? But would she ? She used to tell me that on her tombstone she wanted an inscription that read : " Here lies Virginia Markowitz . She was a very good lay , even though she was Jewish . " I bet it is n't there . ) I bet I was stupid . ( I know I never got to lay her . And I should have . I think I wanted to . I 'd like to lay her now . I wish she had n't killed herself and was still around for me to call up and make love to , to tell her I care for her and how much she has always meant to me . I 'm glad she 's not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know what I want . ) I know I was much more encouraged about my own futurebecause of Virginia , Tom , and Marie Jencks . It was reas/suring to learn that so many people were getting laid , that the activity was indeed so widespread . It augured well . Tom was twenty-one years old and had a big blond married woman of almost twenty-eight who let him make love to her . I took it for granted that when I was twenty-one , I would have a big blond married woman of twenty-eight who would let me make love to her on a desk also . I thought such women came along automatically . It never happened , of course . There was no Marie Jencks for me when I was twentyone . All I got when I was twenty-one was the right to vote . And by the time I finally did get around to screwing a woman of twenty-eight , it was my wife , and I was thirty-two and alreadymarried to her , and that was not what I had been daydreamingabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman of twenty-eight , she generally turns out to be not a woman , but a girl , and often just a little girl ; she is unmarried and unhappy , or married and lonely . And it is n't the same as it would have been if I had that same girl and were still only seventeen . It is sometimes pleasant , sometimes sad ; it is never pleasant for long without turning sad ( and uncomfortable , at least for me . Often , they wish to become more devoted to me than I want them to be . I find close relationships suffocating ) . There is usually something drunken about it ( that 's my fault , I guess  --  I like to drink and to get them drinking too ) , somethingforlorn and pathological ( perhaps in both of us ) . They like to talk a lot , and they like to listen , to be talked to seriously . ( More than anything else , I think , they crave to be spoken to . ) I know one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good friends by now ; I do n't see ; my of them too often because our meetings are uneventful ( at least for me ) and soon turn dull . I meet many young girls I like an awful lot for a while and feel I could love loyally for the rest of my life if I did n't know beforehand that I would grow so bored quickly . That Cuban girl this afternoon was about twenty-six or twenty-eight , and now that I think of herp98again , she was n't really so bad . She was n't really unattractive . She would have been a great girl to have if I were still only a kid of seventeen and knew I could have her whenever I wanted to , and did n't have to pay . She had a small child somewhere being brought up by somebody else . She wanted enough money someday to have her child back and to open her string of beauty parlors . " Do you like to be teased ? " she asked me softly . And when I nodded , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of it , she was n't bad at all . I do n't know what happened to Tom ( he could have been killed , for all I know or care ) ; he left me his handwriting , and I still sit at a desk , in my office at the company or in my study at home , and use it . I do n't know what finally became of Marie Jencks . I never even found out what happened to me . Mrs. Yerger , I sense , is still there . ( The name is different , but the character is indestructible . ) The Mrs. Yergers always survive , unattracted as they are to folly or indiscretion , and so do their grim-faced Mr. Yergers , if there are any ( the Mrs. Yergers do n't need them ) , who are indistinguishable from them by everything but gender and dress . The Mrs. Yergers become not only heads of the file room , but mayors , school principals , college deans , majors , judges , government attorneys , colonels , Selective Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidents of the United States of America , and managers of minor departments in companies like mine . Along with Green and Black and Horace White , I have played the part of tyrant myself at times with people in the company who are subordinate to me , and I play it often at home with my wife and my daughter and my son ,  |p99and  even at times with my idiot child , who also does n't understand what 's going on . ( " How can you call him that ? " my wife will lash out at inc with strong emotion . " How can you talk about him that way ? He 's your own flesh and blood ! " " By definition , " I will inform her coldly , " an idiot is any person who lacks the capacity to develop beyond a mental age of three or four , even if he is my own flesh and blood . " ) I abandon Kagle 's limp for the time being and start around in back of her , observing her closely , through the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been observing me ( through the corner of her eye ) . She is not wearing her girdle ( which is normally a reliable sign that she is in a cordial mood ) . The round-shouldered colored maid we have now is concealing herself in a far corner of our large kitchen , working noiselessly over a black wooden salad bowl we bought from a different round-shouldered colored woman in Jamaica during a vacation there . She is afraid of me ( I think , and I am afraid of her ) . My wife stands at the stove , stirring red wine into a pan of dark meat that might be chicken livers or chunks of beef . The bottle of wine is more than half empty ( or less than half full . Ha , ha ) . I move behind my wife very carefully toward a glass and some ice cubes ( although I am tempted to shout Ole ! when I think of my Cuban ) , and I try my best to remember on what terms she and I parted this morning , or went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is still angry with me for something I did or did n't say or do that I am no longer even aware of . Is she mad or is she glad ? I ca n't remember . And I am unable to tell . So I remain on guard . I bend a bit nearer to her with a cracker and rolled anchovy and perceive suddenly that she is neither mad nor glad . It will make not the slightest difference to her whether we parted on good terms or bad , because she has forgotten too.  |p100She  has been drinking again , and I can tell , from her downcast look of furtive uncertainty , that she also is trying to recall whether we are friends tonight or not . ( Am I mad or am I glad ? ) She is waiting for some sign from me . ( Am I mad at her for something she said or did wrong or glad with her because she did n't ? ) I do n't know why she is so afraid of me when I am so afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what ? God knows ) , tense as a bowstring as she stirs her simmering pan and hopes that I 'm not angry with her for something she did or did n't say or do that she is unable to remember . It 's almost enough to make me laugh . " You 're right , " I say , just to get things going for both of us . " About what ? " " Kagle , " I say , and feign Kagle 's limp for one step . " We had a few drinks . " " I 'm glad they put you in a good mood . " The maid takes it all in spookily with averted eyes . My apprehensions gone , I move to my wife 's side and kiss her lightly on the cheek . She turns her face up diffidently , still not completely sure . She smells of wine and expensive perfume . " Hungry ? " she asks . " I will be . Looks good . " " Let 's hope . " The maid glides past us to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this one working out ? " I ask . " All right , " my wife says . " I had some wine , " she adds hastily . " I was using it to cook the chicken livers with . So I thought I 'd better try some to make sure it 's good . " " Is it good ? " " Good enough . " She smiles . " Do you want some ? " " I 'll have some bourbon . " " I 'll have more wine . " " Kids all right ? " " Yes . "  |p101I  am off to a fairly good start , I feel , and it may yet turn out that this evening at home will be pleasant . My wife is slightly on the defensive ( which will make things easier for both of us ) . The children ( thank heavens ) have not come flying at me with grievances and demands . My daughter is in her room , on the telephone . My boy is in his room , watching television . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Neither has been much affected by the fact that I am there , that Daddy is home ( and I am vaguely hurt by their neglect . A dog would have greeted me with more love ) . The maid still seems properlysubjugated and gives no indication of any incipient Black rebellion . ( We pay her well and treat her courteously , and she is probably more at ease in her position with me than I am in my position with her . I am not totally comfortable having maids . ) Derek is not nearby , yawping or whimpering or trying to talk , and the nurse ( or governess ) we have for him now is not hanging around glaring at us as though he were our fault , as though we wanted him that way . ( Her job , really , is not to nurse or govern , but to keep herself out of sight , and to keep him out of sight as much as possible , even though he is not disagreeable to look at or have around when he is playing quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are leaving me be . I have my whiskey . Wife has her wine . " What did you do today ? " I ask routinely ( before she can ask me ) . " Nothing , " she replies with a shrug , a confession of failure , a penitent admission that another day has been wasted . " Stayed home . Shopped . Rested . I slept . " " Anybody come over ? " " No . " That is good , if she is telling the truth , for it means that she has been drinking only wine , and probably no more than a little bit at a time , for too much wine makes her sick . I believe she is telling the truth , for I do n't think my wife has learned how to lie to me yet . ( My wife does n't know how to flirt and does n't know how to lie to me . ) When she does havep102something she hopes to conceal , she remains silent about it . and hopes I will not inquire . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't like to lie . ) I cooperate by not prying when I sense she has a secret she wants to protect . I try to keep away from whatever I think she is trying to hide . I suspect she does the same for me ( I suspect she knows a great deal more about me than she discloses ) . Our conversations , therefore , are largely about nothing , and frequently restrained . " See you soon , " I say , and start away in back of her with my drink . " I want to read the mail . " She nods . I pat her softly on the fanny as I pass . She is pleased , grateful , and presses her ungirdled ass back into my hand with a leer of lewd and tipsy delight . " Later ? " she says . " I hope you 're in the mood . " " You know me , " I laugh . I 'm sorry to see her this way . ( It 's not the way she used to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known her a long time now , and I do not feel like shouting Ole . I 'm sorry my wife drinks now in the afternoon , and perhapstakes a drink or two in the morning as well . I try not to sayanything to her about it . That would be humiliating , and Iwould not want her to fear I was going to start bullying herabout that , too . Usually , she will use some offhand way ofinforming me she 's had a little something to drink that afternoon ; she met her sister , or the wife of somebody , for lunchor fabric-shopping and had a cocktail or double scotch before coming home , or , as she did just now , she has been cookingwith wine . Sometimes she will want to tell me but wait toolong and wo n't , and I will have the feeling then that she istrembling inside herself , wondering if I have noticed and willcriticize . ( My wife is afraid of me ; I do n't particularly wanther that way , but it makes things easier . ) At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daytime ( she does getdrunk at parties and have a good time  --  although never atp103any of our own . My wife is a superior hostess ) , and neither of the children has ever remarked about her drinking at home during the day , so it may be that she has not let them notice . But I remember that she never used to drink at all ; I remember that she never used to flirt . ( She never used to swear . ) And she is still religious ; she goes to church most Sundays and tries to make the rest of us go too . ( None of us want to . Once in a while we will , when I decide it 's a small enough way of paying her a favor we owe . She is n't quite sure about the minister we have now , and neither am I. ) My wife is also starting to learn how to use dirty words ( in much the same self-conscious way other women take up painting at an advanced age or enroll in adult education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre ) . She is not much good at that , either . Her hell 's and damn 's carry too much emphasis , although her Oh shit 's have the ring of authority by now . She is not as convincing as the rest of the men and women in our several social groups in the jaded indifferencewe affect toward obscenity . My fifteen-year-old daughter is already much better than my wife with dirty words . My daughter uses dirty language with us liberally in order to impress us with her intelligence ; often , she uses it directly at us ( especially at my wife ) , probing to see how far she will be allowed to go . ( She 's not allowed to go far by me . ) And my boy , I can tell , is working up the courage to experimentat home with a dirty word or two . ( He is n't sure what the word fuck means , although he knows it 's dirty . He was under the impression fuck was the word for sexual intercourse , until I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to recall how my wife was , to know the kind of person she used to be and would have liked to remain , and to see what is happening to her now , as it is painfulfor me to witness the deterioration of any human being who has ever been dear ( or even near ) to me , even of chance acquaintances , or total strangers . ( A spastic can affect me profoundly , and a person with some other kind of facial or leg paralysis can immobilize me with repugnance . I want top104look away . I resent blind people when I see them on the street , grow angry with them for being blind and in danger on the street , and glance about desperately for somebody else to step alongside them before I have to and guide them safely across the intersection or around the unexpected sidewalk obstructionthat throws them abruptly into such pathetic confusion . I will not let myself cope with such human distress ; I refuse to accept such reality ; I dump it all right down into my unconsciousand sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all come out in bad dreams if it has to . I forget them anyway as soon as I wake up . ) Martha the typist , that young , plain girl in our office who has bad skin and is going crazy , is a total stranger to me and was already well on her way toward going crazy when she was sent upstairs to us by Personnel ( to finish goingcrazy ) ; I am not responsible ; I do not know her ; I do not know her mother in Iowa who has married again and will not take her back , or her father ( if she still has a father ) , or anyone else among the many people in this world who should be close to her ; yet , if I let it , it could break my heart that she is going crazy . I say nothing to her about how I feel ( or could feel ) . But I always speak kindly to her . My manner is undiscerning . I try not to let her see I care anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me for help , if she knew I knew ) , and I try not to let myself care . I try not to let her see I know . ( She might not know it yet herself . ) It would probably be upsetting for her to learn that everyone around her knew she was going crazy . So I am silent with Martha , and I am silent with my wife , out of the same coarse mixture of sympathy and selfinterest , about her drinking and flirting and dirty words , as I was silent also with my mother when she had the first of her brain strokes , and am silent also with everyone else I know in whom I begin to perceive the first signs of irreversiblephysical decay and approaching infirmity and death . ( I write these people off rapidly . They become dead records in my filing system long before they are even gone , at the first indications that they have begun to go . ) I say nothing to any/body about anything bad once I see it 's already too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother about her brain stroke , even though I was with her when it happened and was the one who finally had to make the telephone call for the doctor . I did not want her to know she was having a brain stroke ; and when she did know , I did n't want her to know I knew . I pretended not to notice when her tongue began rattling suddenly against the roof of her mouth during one of my weekly visits to the apartment in which she lived alone . The same splintered syllable , the same glottal stutter , kept coming out . I masked my surprise and hid my concern . She broke off , that first time , with a puzzled , almost whimsical look , smiled faintly in apology , and tried again to complete what she had started to say . The same thing happened . It happened the next time she tried . And the next . And the time after that , her attempt was not wholehearted ; she seemed to know in advanceit was futile , that it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded when I suggested we get a doctor ; and as I telephoned , the poor old woman sat down and surrendered weakly with a mortified , misty-eyed , bewildered shrug . ( She was frightened . And she was ashamed . ) The doctor explained patiently afterward that it was probably not a clot but only a spasm ( there was no such things as strokes , he said ; there were only hemorrhages , clots , and spasms ) in a very small blood vessel in her brain . ( Had the affected blood vessel been a larger one , she would have suffered paralysis too on one side and perhaps loss of memory . ) But she never spoke again for as long as she lived , althoughshe continued , forgetfully , to try ( out of habit , I suppose , rather than from any expectations of success ) until the second in her series of spasms ( or strokes ) , and then stopped trying . I would visit her in the nursing home ( where she hated to be ) ; I would do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she wanted or rise from her chair or bed ( until she could no longer stand up , either ) and go for them herself . Occasionally , she would jot a request on a scrapp106of paper . I never mentioned her stroke to her or referred to any of the other growing disabilities that appeared and crept over her remorselessly ( arthritis , particularly , and a pervasive physical and mental indolence that blended finally into morbidapathy ) as I sat by her bedside during my visits and talked to her about pleasant matters , soon running out of things to say about me , my wife , my children , and my job that I thought might make her feel good . She never knew that Derek had been born with serious brain damage , although she did know he had been born . I always told her he was fine . ( I always told her everybody was fine . ) We did n't know it either about Derek until he was a few years old , and by then it was too late : we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I were rid of him now , although I do n't dare come right out and say so . I suspect all of us in the family feel this way . Except , possibly , my boy , who may reason that if we did get rid of Derek , we could get rid of him , too , and is already concernedthat we secretly intend to . My boy watches and absorbs everything having to do with us and Derek , as though waiting to see how we finally dispose of him , which is something , he senses , that sooner or later we will probably have to do . ) My conversation to my mother , like my visits , was of no use to her . I pretended , by not speaking of it , for my sake as well as for hers ( for my sake more than for hers ) that she was not seriously ill and in a nursing home she hated , that she was not crippled and growing older and more crippled daily . I did not want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew ) , as she knew before I did , that she was dying , slowly , in stages , her organs failing and her faculties withering one by one . I brought her food ( which , toward the end , when her mind was gone almost entirely and she could barely recollect who I was for more than a minute or two , she would seize with her shriveled fingers and devour ravenously right from the wrapping paper like some famished , caged , wizened , white-haired animal  --  my mother ) . I pretended she was perfectand said nothing to her about her condition until she finally died . I was no use to her ( except to bring her food ) , asp107I am no help now to our typist who is going insane right before my eyes , and am no help either to my wife with her drinking and her flirting and her other rather awkward efforts to be vital and gay . ( I have visions these days when I am lying alone in strange beds in hotels or motels , trying to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stinging fleas or bedbugs against which I am utterly inept because I am too squeamish to endure them and have no other place to go. ) . l do n't want my wife ever to find out she drinks too much at parties and sometimes behaves very badly with other people and makes an extremely poor impression when she thinks she is making a very good one ! If she did ( if she ever had even an inkling of how clumsy and overbearing she sometimes becomes ) , the knowledge would crush her ( she would be destroyed ) , and she is already dejected enough . At home during the day , she drinks only wine ; in the evening , before or after dinner , she might drink scotch if I do . Many evenings we will not drink at all . She does n't really like the taste of whiskey ( although she is starting to enjoy the taste of martinis and to welcome that numbing-enlivening effect they mercifully produce so quickly ) and does n't know how to mix cocktails . At parties now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walk in and try to get a little high as quickly as she can . Then she will stick to that same drink for the rest of the evening . If things have been fairly comfortablebetween us that day and she is feeling secure , she will have a loud , jolly , friendly good time , with me and everyone else , until she gets drunk ( if she does ) , and sometimes dizzy and sick , and no real harm will be done , although she used to be a quiet , modest girl , somewhat shy and refined , almostdemure , always tactful and well-mannered . If things are not so good , if she is not happy that day with me , my daughter , or herself , she will flirt belligerently . She will usually frighten away the man ( or men ) she flirts with ( they almost never hang around long enough to flirt back ) because she does n't know how ; her approach is threatening , her invitation to seduction a challenging attack , andp108there may be something of a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be with some man she knows and feels thoroughly safe with ( she does n't really want to flirt at all , I suppose ) and usually one who appears to be enjoying himself and bothering no one . ( Perhaps he seems smug . ) It is saddeningfor me to watch her ; I do not want other people to dislike her . She will challenge the man openly , sometimes right in the presence of his wife , with a bald and suggestive remark or enticement , sliding her hand heavily up his shoulder blade if he is standing or squeezing the inside of his thigh if he is seated ; and then , as though he had already rejected her , turn taunting , vengeful , and contemptuous before he can respond at all . As neatly and promptly as I can , before much damage is done , I will move in to rescue her , to guide her away smoothly with a quip and a smile . I never rebuke her ( although I am often furious and ashamed ) ; I humor her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with herself . ( I do n't know why . ) " You 're just jealous , " she will accuse defiantly , when I have led her away . " Damned right , I am , " I reply with a forced laugh , and sometimes I will put my hands on her intimately to help persuade her I am . " You 'd better be , " she 'll gloat triumphantly . We have had better times together , my wife and I , than we are having now ; but I do not think we will have them again . Dinner , my wife says , will be ready soon . My mood is convivial ( so many times when I am home with my family , I wish I were somewhere else ) and I decide , magnanimously , that tonight ( at least ) I will do everything I can to make them all happy . " Hello , " I say as my children assemble.  | " Hi , " says my daughter . " Hi , " says my son . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing , " she says . " Was that a look ? " " No . " " It was a look , was n't it ? " " I said hello , did n't I ? " she retorts , lowering her voice , maliciously , to a tone of unconcerned innocence . " What do you want me to do ? " ( Oh , shit , I meditate pessimistically , my spirits sinking , what the hell is bothering her now ? ) " If something 's wrong , " I persist tolerantly ( feeling myselfgrowing incensed ) , " I wish you 'd tell me what it is . " She grits her teeth . " Nothing 's wrong . " " Dinner 's ready , " says my wife . " I wo n't like it , " says my boy . " What 's bothering her ? " I ask my wife loudly , as we move together into the dining room . " Nothing . I do n't know . I never know . Let 's sit down . Let 's try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get through just one meal without anybody yelling and screaming and getting angry . That should n't be too hard , should it ? " " That would suit me fine , " says my daughter , emphasizingher words to indicate that it might not suit somebody else ( me ) . ( She has not looked at me directly yet . ) " It 's okay with me , " says I. " I still wo n't like it , " says my boy . " What does that mean ? " I ask . " I want two hot dogs . " " You can at least taste it , " argues my wife . " What ? " asks my daughter . " You ca n't keep eating hot dogs all your life . " " If you want them , you 'll get them , " I promise my son . " Okay ? " " Okay . " " Okay ? " I ask my wife . " No fights ? "  | " All right . " " Amen , " I conclude with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy asks me . " Ole , " I answer facetiously . " What does that mean ? " " Okay . Have you got it ? " " Since when ? " intrudes my daughter . " Ole , " my boy replies . " No , it does n't , " says my daughter in her soft , weary monotone without looking up , attempting ( I know ) to keep the bickering going . " Ole does n't mean okay . " " If you were in a better frame of mind , " I josh with her , " I would threaten to wring your neck for that . " " There 's nothing wrong with my frame of mind , " shereplies . " Why do n't you threaten to wring my neck anyway ? " " Because you would n't realize I was kidding now , andyou 'd probably think I really wanted to harm you . " " Ha . " " Ca n't we have a peaceful meal ? " pleads my wife . " It should n't be so hard to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grit my teeth . ) " It would be a lot easier , " I tell her amiably , " if you did n't keep saying that . " " Forgive me , " my wife answers . " Forgive me for breath-ing . " " Oh , Jesus . " " That 's right , " says my wife , " swear . " " I did n't mean it that way , " I tell her harshly ( lying , of course , because that was exactly the way I did mean it ) . " Honest , I did n't . Look , we all agreed not to argue tonight , did n't we ? " " I know I did , " says my daughter . " Then let 's not argue . Okay ? " " If you do n't shout , " says my daughter . " Ole , " says my boy , and we all smile.  | ( At last we have agreed about something . ) Now that we have agreed to relax , we are all very tense . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do enjoy my boy . I can think of three girls I like a lot and know a long time Penny , Jill , and Rosemary Iwould rather be with , and the new young one in our Art Department , Jane , who , I bet , I could be having dinner and booze with instead if I had taken the trouble to ask . ) None of us at our dining room table seems willing now to risk a remark . " Should we say grace ? " I suggest jokingly in an effort to loosen things up . " Grace , " says my boy , on cue . It 's an old family joke that really pleases only my boy ; and my daughter 's lips droop deliberately with disdain . She holds that scornful expression long enough to make sure I notice . I make believe I do n't . I try not to let it rankle me ( I know my daughter often finds me childish , and that does rankle me . I have a bitter urge now to reproach her , to shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick her very sharply under the table in the bones of her leg . I have an impulse often to strike back at the members of my family , even the children , when I feel they are insulting me or taking advantage . Sometimeswhen I see one of them in the process of doing somethingimproper , or making a mistake for which I know I will be justified in blaming them , I do not intercede to help or correct but hold back in joy to watch and wait , as though observing from a distance a wicked scene unfold in some weird dream , actually relishing the opportunity I spy approachingthat will enable me to criticize and reprimand them and demand explanations and apologies . It horrifies me ; it is something like watching them back fatally toward an open window or the edge of a cliff and offering no warning to save them from injury or death . It is perverse and I try to overcomeit . There is this crawling animal flourishing somewhere inside me that I try to keep hidden and that strives to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whom it wishes top112destroy . I know it is covered with warts . It might be me ; it might also be me that it wishes to destroy ) and , succeeding in stifling my anger beneath a placid smile , say : " Pass me the bread , will you , dear ? " My daughter does . My wife sits opposite me at the head ( or foot ) of the table , my boy on my left , my daughter on my right . The maid pads back and forth without talking , delivering bowls of food from the kitchen . My wife spoons large portions out into separate plates and passes them . We are silent . We do not feel free any longer to converse without inhibition in front of our colored maids . ( I am not even certain of this one 's name ; they do not stay with us long anymore . ) " The salad is good , Sarah , " my wife says . " I did what you told me . " I am not comfortable having our maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children ) , and I wo n't allow it ( even though my wife , I suspect , would still prefer to have it done that way , as it was done in her own family when she was a child , as she still sees it done in good middle-class homes on television and in the movies , and as she imagines it is also done at Buckingham Palace and the White House ) . I am not comfortable being served by maids anywhere , even less so in other people 's homes ( where I am never certain how much food I am supposed to take , always have difficulty manipulating the serving forks and spoons from a sideways position , and am in continual anxiety that I am going to bump the meat and vegetable platters with my shoulder or elbow and send them spilling to the floor . Of course , that 's never happened yet ) . I suffer the same discomfort even when they are white ( the maids , I mean , not the friends . I do n't have any Black friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pretty Black girls these days that whet my appetite . They 're all out of reach for me by now , I guess , unless they 're Cuban or Puerto Rican ) . " I think it 's good , " my wife says . " I hope it 's good . " " I wo n't like it , " my boy says.  | " That 's enough , " I tell him . " Okay . " He retreats quickly . He can not stand it when I am displeased with him . " What is it ? " my daughter asks . " Chicken livers and noodles in that wine sauce you like with beef . I think you 'll like it . " " I wo n't , " mumbles my boy . " Will you at least taste it ? " " I do n't like liver . " " It is n't liver . It 's chicken . " " It 's chicken liver . " " Please taste it . " " I 'll taste it , " he answers . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I have mine ? " My wife and I watch with bated breath as my daughter pokes at the meat solemnly , almost lugubriously , with her fork and touches a small piece to her mouth . " It 's good , " she says without enthusiasm and begins eating . My wife and I are relieved . ( My daughter is somewhat tall and overweight and should be dieting ; but my wife , who reminds her endlessly to diet , makes such things as noodles and serves large portions , and my daughter will probably ask for more . ) " It 's delicious , " I say . " Can I have my hot dogs ? " " Sarah , put up two frankfurters . " " Can I have the bread back ? " I give my daughter the bread . " I 've got some good news , " I begin , and each of them turns to look at me . I am still brimming with excitement ( and conceit ) over Arthur Baron 's conversation with me ; and in a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ( they are my family , and I am attached to them ) , I decide to share my joyful feelings . " Yes , I think I may have some very important news for all of us. "  |p114The  three of them gaze at me now with such intense curiosity that I find myself forced to break off . " What ? " one of them asks . " On second thought , " I hesitate , " it may not be that important . In fact , now that I think of it , it is n't important at all . It is n't even interesting . " " Then why did you say it ? " my daughter wants to know . " To tantalize you , " I kid . " What in hell does that mean ? " my boy asks . " Do you have something ? " my wife asks . " Oh , maybe yes , " I tease her jovially , " and maybe no . " " To tease us , " my daughter exclaims to my boy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish again . And again I have that powerful , momentary , spiteful impulse to injure her , to wound her deeply with a cutting retort , to reach out over the dining room table and smack her hard on the side of the face or neck , to kick her viciously under the table in her ankle or shin . I can do nothing , though , but ignore her and try to maintain my facade of paternal good humor . ) " Then why do n't you tell us ? " my wife inquires . " Especially if it 's good . " " I will , " I say . " All I wanted to say , " I announce , and my spirit turns manifestly arch and tantalizing again as I pause to butter a piece of bread and take a bite , " is that I think I may have to start playing golf again . " There is a thoughtful , puzzled , almost rebellious silence now as each of them tries to figure out before the others what it is I am waggishly withholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asks my nine-year-old boy , who is still not certainwhat kind of game golf is , whether it is a good game or a bad one . " Yes . " " Why golf ? " asks my wife with surprise . ( She knows I hate the game . ) " Golf , " I repeat.  | " You do n't even like golf . " " I hate golf . But it may have to be golf . " " Why ? " " I bet he 's getting a better job ! " my daughter guesses . ( In many ways , she is the smartest and most devious of all of us . ) " Are you ? " asks my wife . " Maybe . " " What kind of job ? " My wife 's reaction is suspicious , almostmorose . I know she has assumed secretly for several years that I have been longing for a different job that would take me away from home more often . " Selling . " " Selling what ? " asks my boy . " Selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , almost stunned by the riddle of my reply . Then he understands it was meant as a joke , and he bursts into laughter . His eyes sparkle , and his face lights up joyously . ( Everybody likes my boy . ) " Do you mean it ? " probes my wife , studying me . She is still unsure whether to be pleased or not . " I think so . " " Will you have to travel more than you have to travel now ? " " No . Probably less . " " Will you make more money ? " my daughter asks . " Yes . Maybe a lot more . " " Will we be rich ? " " No . " " Will we ever be rich ? " " No . " " I do n't want you to travel more , " my boy complains . " I 'm not going to travel more , " I repeat for him , with a trace of annoyance . " I 'm going to travel less . " ( I begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions are coming too swiftly ; I can feel my self-satisfaction ebbing away , and an army of irritations mobilizing too rapidly for me to keepp116track of and control . I am already replying to them with my slight stammer . ) " Are you going to start talking to yourself again ? " my boy can not resist baiting me mischievously . " I was n't talking to myself , " I declare firmly . " Yes , you were , " my daughter murmurs . " Like last year ? " my boy persists . " I was not talking to myself , " I repeat loudly . " I was practicing a speech . " " You were practicing it to yourself , " my boy points out . " Will they let you make a speech this year ? " my daughterasks . " At the company convention ? " " Oh , yes , " I respond with a smile . " A long speech ? " " Oh , yes , indeed . I imagine they might let me make a speech as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Will you be working for Andy Kagle ? " my wife asks . The question brings me to a halt . " A little something like that , " I stammer evasively . ( The fun goes out of my family guessing game , and now I am sorry that I started it . ) I laugh nervously . " It is n't definite yet . And it 's all a pretty long way off . Maybe I should n't even have mentioned it . " " I 'm glad you 'll be working for Andy Kagle , " my wife asserts . " I do n't like Green . " " I did n't say I 'd be working for Kagle . " " I do n't trust Green . " " Do n't you listen ? " " Why are you snapping at me ? " " I do n't want you to be a salesman , " my daughter exclaimswith unexpected emotion , almost in tears . " I do n't want you to have to go around to other people 's fathers and beg them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to be a salesman , " I protest impatiently . " Look , what 's everybody talking about it so much for ? I have n't got it yet . And I 'm not even sure I 'm going to take it . "  | " You do n't have to shout at her , " my wife says . " I 'm not shouting . " " Yes , you are , " she says . " Do n't you hear yourself ? " " I 'm sorry I shouted . " " You do n't have to snap at everybody , either . " " And I 'm sorry I snapped . " My wife is right , this time . Without my realizing it , I have moved from optimistic conceit into a bad temper ; and without my being conscious of it , my voice has risen with anger , and I have been shouting at them again . We are all silent at the table now . The children sit with their eyes lowered . They seem too fearful even to fidget . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another headache is threatening ) . I am numb with shame . I feel so helpless and uncertain . I wish one of them would say something that would give me a clue , that would point the way I must follow toward an easy apology . ( I feel lost . ) But no one will speak . I pounce upon an energetic idea . I whirl upon my son without warning , shoot my index finger out at him , and de-mand : " Are you mad or glad ? " " Glad ! " he cries with laughter and delight , when he recognizes I am joking again and no longer irate . I spin around toward my daughter and shoot my index finger out at her . " Are you mad or glad ? " I demand with a grin . " Oh , Daddy , " she answers . " Whenever you make one of us unhappy , you always try to get out of it by behaving like a child . " " Oh , shit , " I say quietly , stung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children ? " my wife asks . " They say it in front of us , " I retort . I turn to my daughter . " Say shit . " " Shit , " she says . " Say shit , " I say to my son . He is ready to start crying.  | ( I want to reach out instinctively to console and reassurehim and rumple his soft , sandy hair . I am deeply fond of my boy , although I am not sure anymore how I feel about my daughter . ) " I 'm sorry , " I tell him quickly . ( I have the shameful , shocking apprehension that if I did put my hand out to comforthim , he would cringe reflexively , as though afraid I were going to strike him . I recoil from that thought in pain . ) I turn to my daughter . " I 'm sorry , " I say to her too , earnestly . " You 're right , and I 'm sorry . I do act like a child . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I want another drink , " I explainapologetically , as I stand up . " I 'm not going to eat anymore . You go on , though . I 'll wait in the living room . I 'm sorry . " They continue eating after I leave , their voices subdued . I do such things to them , I know , even when I do n't intend to . But I can not admit this to my wife or children . My wife would not understand . I can not really say to my wife : " I 'm sorry . " She would think I was apologizing . My wife and I can not really talk to each other about the same things anymore ; but I sometimes forget this and try . We are no longer close enough for honest conversation ( although we are close enough for frequent sexual intercourse ) . She would respond with something as vacuous and frustrating and galling as " You should be , " or " You did n't have to snap at everybody , " or " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As though my snapping , or her snapping at me ( she can snap too ) , were any part of the problem . She would say something exactly like that ; and I would be brought to a stop again , as though slapped sharply ; I would be stunned ; I would feel abandoned and isolated again , and I would sink back for safety again inside my dense , dark wave of opaque melancholy ; I would feel lonely and I would be brought face to face again with the fact that I have nobody in this world to confide in or reach toward for help ; I would miss my mother ( and my father ? ) and my dead big brother , and I would begin daydreaming once again about some new job with a different company thatp119would take me far away from home more often . Someday soon someone may be dropping bombs on us . I will scream : " The shy is falling ! They are dropping bombs ! People are on fire ! The world is over ! It 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You do n't have to raise your voice to me . " What happened to us ? Something did . I was a boy once , and she was a girl , and we were both new . Now we are man and woman , and nothing feels new any longer ; everything feels old . I think we liked each other once . I think we used to have fun ; at least , it seems that way now , although we were alwaysstruggling about one thing or another . I was always struggling to get her clothes off , and she was always struggling to keep them on . I remember things like that . I remember the many times I had to pull my wife 's dress up and her panties down because she did n't like to make love outdoors , or even indoors if anyone else was even remotely in the vicinity : in the same house or apartment , in the next room ( even at hotels ! She would be petrified if she heard someone stirring in the adjoining room ) , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I 'd unbutton her blouse almost anywhere to get at her bra and breasts . ( Pale blue brassieres still do drive me crazy more than black ; she used to wear them . ) She was always afraid we 'd be caught . I did n't care ( although I might have cared if we 'd ever been caught ) . I was always ripping open her slacks or tearing off her bathing suit or tennis shorts and flinging them away somewhere over my back as I went at her as hard and fast as I could every chance I had . I was a pretty hot kid once . I did n't care whether she enjoyed it or not ; just as long as I got mine . I was always trying to jump her . We were with her parents and her younger sister a lot then , and I would grab at her the second they all went out and try to bang her before any of them got back . In the country , during the summer , or at the seashore , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and do itp120to her on the porch or right down on the ground or sand ( although I did n't like the sand in my clothes and hair afterward  --  and she did n't like the ground , because it hurt her ass and made it black and blue ) . I was always pulling at her buttons and zippers and clutching and scratching at the snaps and elastic of her underthings . I was absolutely wild for her when she was a girl and I was a boy , absolutely out of my head with volcanic lust . I was all cock and hard-on . I wanted to come , come , come . I would give her no warning , no time to deliberate or converse or prepare or find any excusesfor delay , and often she did not understand fully what was happening to her until I had her half undressed and was already swarming all over her , wholly on fire and stone deaf to all her objections and premonitions , and it was too late for her to make me stop . ( Sometimes I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and how I would spring at her the moment I had the opportunity and selecting the way in which I would ravish her this time . ) No matter where it was I trapped , seized , and finally overcame her ( if it was anywhere outside the bolted door of our own bedroom ; often it was even behind the locked door of our own bedroom ) , she would recline and heave submissively beneath me with her eyes wide open in gleaming fright , turning her gaze from one side to the other rapidly and distressfully to make certain no one was seeing , listening , or approaching . ( I think now that I probably enjoyed her terror and my violence . ) I did n't mind that her eyes were open and darting all about and that her strongest emotions were not those of passion or entirely on me , just as long as I had her when I wanted her and got what I wanted ; it might , in fact , have added something , that tangy , triumphant sense of frenzied danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I often wish I were driven now by that same hectic mixture of blind ardor , haste , and tension . ( It might , in fact , have added a great deal . ) Maybe that 's what 's missing . I lay girls now that are as young as she was then , and much more nimble , prof/ligate , and responsive , but it is n't as rich with impulse and excitement and generally not as satisfying afterward . ( There is no resistance . ) I have more control and maturity now and can manipulate and exploit them coolly and skillfully , but it is n't nearly as much fun anymore as it used to be with her , and I miss her greatly and love us both very deeply when I remember how we used to be then . I have large rooms now with big beds and all the privacy and time I want ; the girls have places of their own , or I have Red Parker 's apartment in the city and hotel rooms and suites on business trips out of town ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matter-of-fact , even with someone I am with for the very first time ( and I often wonder , even while I am in the act of doing it , why I bother . I am no sooner in than I 'm thinking about getting out . I no sooner come than I want to go ) . " Let 's go into the bedroom now , " I will say ( or they will say ) . " All right . " I think it was better the other way with me and my wife when we were both so much younger . " Hurry , hurry , " she would urge , beg , moan , pant , demand , murmur , pray , implorefrantically as she lay and churned in my grasp , doing everything she could think of to help bring me to an end quickly before we were discovered . And I would work away at her , sometimes grinning when she could n't see me , and have the time of my life . That was fun we used to have together . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and it is fun now for both of us to recall and laugh about ( when we are laughing ) . We often reminisce together warmly about some of the crazy times and places I did get her . My wife enjoys looking back even more than I do and has a better memory for separate occasions . ( " Remember the time in that boathouse when my father  --  " " And your kid sister was doing it all summer  --  " " You sound envious . "  | " She probably got more than I did . " " You had no complaints . " " I did when I found out about her . " " Were you hot for her ? " " Only when I knew about her . " " Are you hot for her now ? " " Do n't be crazy . She 's a God-damned reactionary bitch now . " " You do n't ever say anything to her about  --  " " I hardly ever talk to her . " " Remember the time on the lake in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the time I once tried to do it to her right on the bottom of a rowboat , far out on a lake . ( I remember dead Virginia from my old automobile casualty insurance company , and I bet I could do it now also in a canoe to a carefree young coed like Virgin-for-Short , but I do n't think I would want to anymore , not at my age , not in a canoe . ) I did almost everything else to her that day while she wriggled and kissed and fought and hugged and fretted against the bottom of that rowboat , but when it came to the nudeness of it , to the pulling of her things off and my things down , she was terror-stricken by the thought that people might be seeing us from the houses along the shore and , almost weeping miserably , made me stop . So I rowed furiously to a small island a little farther out ( I think I must have broken the speed record for rowing that day ) and laid her on the ground just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side with wide-open eyes flashing in anguish and fear , pleading with me desperately please to stop or please to hurry up and finish before someone came trudging up through the trees and caught us . We were alreadymarried then . It was fun , even though we often fought about it bitterly : she would cry , and I would rage if I could not have my way with her in matters of sex and just about everything else . ( My feelings were easily hurt . ) I used to want to jump herp123everywhere . We are both glad now that I did . I was always throwing her halters off then or shoving her blouses and sweaters up to go for her breasts and lips like someone starved , suffering the aching , compulsive need and joy in my heart and head and mouth and throat and in the palms of my hands . ( What a nutty kid I was , even then . ) " Not now , " she would say , or " Do you love me ? " she would ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pushed and forced myself upon her . It took very little to get me excited then , usually nothing more than the sight of her , or just the thought , when I had been away , that I would be back with her soon . ( Then I knew what being horny really meant . ) When we were alone indoors and knew we had time , I could be different , and so could she ; but there were many times when we could not be alone . And the trouble with my wife then was that she did not like to make love anywhere outdoors . She did not like to screw in parks , or on beaches , or in bushes , or standing up against walls , doors , or trees ( and I did ) . She did not want to screw in the back of my car ( or the front ) , and I always had to force her . ( There was frequently no better place we had for it then ; and when there was , I often did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady then , and I liked her for that ( more than I like her drinking and flirting now , or her raucous tones when she is having a good time at parties and dinners ) . But I also liked getting laid . There was one whole summer at the lake when she did not want to make love at all because we were sharing the house with her mother and father and sister , and one person or another was always around . That was the summer , I remember , that her sister got knocked up near the end and almost drove her mother and father insane before she would agree to the abortion ( it was not that she wanted the baby ; she was afraid of surgery ) , although it could have happened at college the first week she went back . My wife and I were married then , and what was clear ( at least to me ) was that her kid sister had been making out effortlessly all summer long , while I wasp124having so much trouble , which made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that summer trying to get into the wrong sister , my wife . Once I found out about her sister , I wanted to lay her too , even though I did n't like her . Later , when we had our own place , my wife did n't want to make love until she was certain all of the children were sound asleep and the door to the bedroom was locked and the door to the apartment was double-locked . ( God knows who she imagined might sneak in and catch us at it then . Burglars ? ) There was a long , long period , even when we had our own place , when she did not want to screw any time during the day , even before we had children , and when there was no one else around . ( Nowadays , she 'll do it with me just about any place , any time , especially if she 's had a drink or two . ) She needed darkness , even at night ; she wanted to be hidden ; the lights had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the closet doors . She would rather I did not watch her undress and did not gaze at her when she was walking or lying naked ; often she came to the bed with her nightgown already on , having removed her clothes privately in the bathroomor closet , even though she knew I would slip it up and off her immediately . Then , though , when conditions were exactlyright , once she had made certain she was safe from interruptionand concealed from watching eyes , when everythingaround us was just the way she wanted it , she could be absolutely fine in just about every way and feel proud of herself and me afterward and in between . And she was n't so bad all those other times when I had to force her and we had to do it fast ( she learned rapidly that the more zealously she pitched in to give me what I wanted , the sooner it would be over ) , although she was never nearly as good at age twentyeightas my Cuban whore was this afternoon . ( " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hear her purring again . Of course I do . Maybe I never left my wife enough time to tease me then , or even to learn how . ) Nowadays , my wife is much better . Nowadays , my wifep125is completely different about this whole matter of sex ; but so on I. She is almost always amorous nowadays , it seems , and ready to take chances that horrify even me . I can usually tell when she 's been thinking about it the instant I walk in , by a hold , questioning , determined look in her eyes and a funny , self-satisfied , slightly twisted smile . I know I am right if she has left her girdle off . ( Her girdle is off tonight . I remember when she did n't need a girdle and would n't wear one ; now she 'll seldom go out of the house without a girdle , even though she still does n't need one . ) When she is in the mood , I have only to grip her elbow or nudge her gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time I want to and just about anywhere . Or she will come after me . She is always in the mood when she drinks ( unless she is sick ) , and she drinks almost every day now . I have only to pass within arm 's reach of her in the kitchen when she is cooking or meet her by accident iii one of the hallways and she moves right up against me and is ready to sink down on the spot ( she has even had me do it to her on the kitchen floor ) , in the dark or in brilliant daylight . She lifts her own skirt now , and fumbles impatiently with my pants if I am not removing them quickly enough . ( I 'm not sure I like her this way , although I would have liked it back then , but I 'm not so sure about that , either . I 'm really not sure I want my wife to be as lustful and compliant as one of Kagle 's whores or my girl friends , although I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you really have a chance at a better job ? " she asks me later , when we are upstairs in our bedroom . " I think so . " " Much better ? " " And how . " " Will you make more money ? " " And how . " " Oh , boy , " she responds . And she swarms all over me irrepressibly , her arms and legs and mouth opening and entwining , with our bedroomp126door open and the children probably still awake . And I am the one now who wiggles free and rises from the bed to close and lock the door and extinguish the overhead light . " You 're some girl , " I tell her admiringly , after a long , deep embrace during which we are both practically still . " You did it , " she agrees readily , with a boastful laugh , sitting astride me now and rocking back and forth . " You made me this way . " I ca n't believe it was all my fault.  |p129Both  our children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and I suppose that is my fault too ( although I 'm not sure I understand how or why . I no longer think of Derek as one of my children . Or even as mine . I try not to think of him at all ; this is becoming easier , even at home when he is nearby with the rest of us , making noise with some red cradle toy or making unintelligible sounds as he endeavors to speak . By now , I do n't even like his name . The children do n't care for him , either . No one really cares for him , not even the nurses we hire , and they are paid to care for him and to pretend to like him ; they are nearly always unmarried women in their late thirties or older ; they are very expensive and usually pretend to love him in the beginning ; they act adoring and jealously protective of him for just the first few weeks and then turn negligent toward him and impudent and reproachfulwith the rest of us . We turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own or are fired . My wife and I take turns telling them they must go . I begin to detest all of them almost from the moment we hire them ; they do n't like me . I hate and fear the one we have now , who is older than I am , superstitious , and forcefully opinionated ; she reminds me of Mrs. Yerger . I want to yell dirty things at this nurse now for the debasement Mrs. Yerger made me suffer then . Every older woman I find myself afraid of reminds me of Mrs.p130Yerger . Every feeble old woman I see reminds me of my mother . Every young girl who attacks my pride reminds me of my daughter . No one reminds me of my father , which is okay with me , I guess , since I do n't remember a father for anyone to remind me of . Except Arthur Baron . I think I may feel a little bit about Arthur Baron the way I might have felt about my father if he had lived a little longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . I want to be rid of her . If she does n't quit soon , my wife or I will have to fire her , which never seems to upset any of them as much as it does us , and as much as it would upset me if I were ever fired . This will leave things at home dismal and disorganized for a while . I will go out of town on a business trip until a new one is found . I always like to leave things like that for my wife and her sister to take care of . Her sister is good at things like that . I always like to be out of town when we have to look for a new nurse or move from one house to another . I always like to be somewhere else when anything unpleasant is taking place . We will feel glad to be rid of her when we finally do make her go ; but each one has to be replaced ; we always have to find another ; or we will have to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never look at him again . We will erase him , cross him out , file him away  --  even though we go to visit him three or four times the first year , one or two times the second , and after that perhaps not at all , we will never really look at him again . We will put him out of sight , think of him less and less . He will visit us , maybe , in dreams . " I wonder how he 's doing , " one of us might think of speculating from time to time , if either of us dared to face the consequences of a reply . And later : " Whatever happened to him ? You know , that kid we used to have ? Derek , I think his name was . The one with something wrong . Are we still in touch with him ? " My wife and I are not able to send him away yet . He is still too little . There is no hope . He is lots of trouble . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one wants top131give it to him , not his father , his mother , his sister , or his ( brother . None of us really even wants to play with him anymore . Although we take turns making believe ) . My daughter , who is past fifteen , is a lonely and disgruntledperson . ( She is much more than disgruntled , I know . She is unhappy ; but that 's the form her unhappiness tends to take , and that 's the nature of the criticism and complaints with which we generally have to contend . I would n't mind so much , I think , if she were unhappy and obliging . Like my son . It would make things easier for me . Although it does not seem to make things easier for him . ) She is dissatisfied with its and dissatisfied with herself . She is a clever , malicious girl with lots of insight and charm when she is n't morose and rude . She is often mean , often depressed . She resents my wife and me terribly and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us were gone or dead . ( In fact , she does tell us that , in exactly those words . ) And it 's a lucky thing my wife and I are both sensible enough to remind each other that she really does n't mean it . ( Even though I know she often does mean it , and that deep inside her , probably , she often wishes , in melodramatic fantasy , that she were dead also , and that we were at her graveside and sorry . ) At least I 'm sure she may mean it at the time she says it and perhaps , subconsciously , she harbors that evil wish in regard to us always . Perhaps she really does wish that my wife or I will die soon . It would not be so unnatural for her to do so ; it would not be so difficult for me to understand ( for did n't I have that same repugnant wish for my mother after she fell sick , and perhaps even earlier , when she began to grow old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need me ? I was impatientfor her to die . And told myself she 'd be better off ) . If my daughter is poised , if she is looking smug and wearing her thin-lipped half-smile of calculating villainy when she remarksto my wife or me that she really does n't think she would mind very much if my wife and/or I fell sick and/or died , I know she does not mean what she is saying ; she is speaking for effect ; she is merely searching , immaturely andp132compulsively , for a painful , punishing clash with us ( making sadistic family small talk , so to speak ) and slicing out at a sensitive old wound that she knows intuitively will open freely and bleed with pain . ( My daughter likes to hurt us . She sometimesprofesses remorse , but lets us know she does n't really feel it . ) If , however , the statements gush from her in a high shriek or tumble out brokenly in gulping , hysterical sobs , then there is no ignoring the sincerity of her passionate hatred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy . ( In these moments she is pathetic . She would break my heart , if she were somebody else 's . ) She has a very pretty face but does n't believe it . ( She has what I believe is called a low  --  or poor  --  self-image . ) And nothing my wife or I can do will help . I realize now that I have not always given replies to her questions and commentsthat were appropriate . When she tells me she wishes she were dead , I tell her she will be , sooner or later . When she tells me life is empty and monotonous and that there does not seem to be any point to it , I tell her everybody feels that way now and then , particularly at her age , and that she 's probably right . When she told me , in tones of solemn importance , that she hoped to have a lover before she was eighteen and would want to live with him for several years even though she is never going to get married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and was astounded when her face went bloodless with shock and she seemed about to cry . When she asks me if I ever thought of killing myself when I was young , I answer yes . And when she came to me , even that first time , to say she was n't happy , I told her that I was n't either and that nobody ought to expect to be . By now , she is able to anticipate many of my sardonic retorts and can mimic my words before I say them . Sometimesthis annoys me ; other times it amuses me I do n't know why there is a difference in my reaction . My error , I think , is that I always speak to her as I would to a grown-up ; and all she wants , probably , is for me to talk to her as a child . I am simply not able to stop myself from saying thingsp133to her I know I should n't ; sometimes the words escape from me before I can consider them , before I am even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped by my mouth and tongue to fly out between my lips . And I hear my blunt or cutting remarks with a start of astonishment , as though they came from somebody else and were directed harmfully at me as well as at her , as though they had their source in some dark and frightening area of my soul with which I am not in communication . It is that same weird , perverse , glowering part of me that shelters my recurring impulse to kick Kagle 's lame leg very hard , and to kick my daughter 's leg under the table or strike her ( I am never really tempted to hit my wife or my boy , and I never have . I do n't think I have . I have never hit my daughter either . Or kicked her ) , and it nourishes refreshingly that thrilling desire of mine to say very cruel things to people I like who are in trouble and confide in me and request my sympathy or help . I do rejoice momentarily in the misfortunes of friends . I cannotcondone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need ; I experience undeniable gladness that I enjoy suppressing . I like finding out I 'm better off than somebody else . There are things going on inside me I can not control and do not admire . My daughter does n't laugh much anymore ( she enjoys my boy a great deal , but picks on him often with bad intent ) and has few interests or pleasures . ( The same seems true of the boys and girls who remain her friends . They like music hut not much , not as much as they seem to wish they could . None are cheerful . All are glum and creepy , usually . They cast a pall . I hope they outgrow it . I do n't know how to talk to them . ) She sits alone in her room for long periods of time doing absolutely nothing but thinking ( I sit alone in my study for long periods of time doing absolutely the same thing ) ; and what she likes to think about most is herself ; what interestsher most is herself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to talk about most is herself . She is not much different from me , I suppose . I think , though , that Ip134was happier than she is when I was young , and that all the boys and girls I grew up with and went to elementary and high school with were also much happier than she and her friends . I like to think that . But I really did n't know these other boys and girls as well as I know her . And perhaps they were not so happy as I think they were . And perhaps I was not . I did n't have as much to do with them when we were out of school and not in the street ; I did not know them in the home and did not know them when they were alone . And I 'm not so confident anymore that my own recollections of my childhood are as infallible as I have always believed them to be . I also think I may have been more unhappy than my daughter when I was young , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of pathless isolation . There are long gaps in my past that remain obscure and give no clue . There are cryptic rumblings inside them but no flashes of recall . They are pitch black and remain that way , and all the things I was and all the changes and things that happened to me then will be lost to me forever unless I find them . No one else will . Where are they ? Where are those scattered , ripped pieces of that fragmented little boy and bewildered young man who turned out to be me ? There are times now when it seems to me that I may not have been any place at all for long periods of time . What ever happened to all those truly important parts of my past that no longer exist in my memory and have been ignored or forgotten by everyone else ? No one will ever recall them . It is too late to gather me all up and put me together again . My life , therefore , is not entirely credible . I have trouble believing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ) with Virginia in the storeroom of the automobile casualty insurance company and me with my wife making love on our honeymoon and me who is bored , melancholy , and reflective in my office at the company now , or in my study at home ; but I ca n't really believe it was really me ( I. Even though I know it 's true ) who sang those silly military songs exuberantly so long ago as we marched slovenly along in formation in uniform , sorted accident reports in an in/surance office , filed folders , shot crap and played cards for pennies , nickels , and dimes , had satisfactory erotic dreams and was thankful for them , masturbated , and was thankful that I could , read the comic strips and sports pages of the New York Daily News and the New York Mirror , which , alas , is now defunct soon there wo n't be anything left  --  saidgood-bye to my mother five mornings each week if I reminded myself to say anything at all to her when I left , carried a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or canned salmon sandwiches with me into Manhattan for lunch , had tantrums as a child in frenzied and incoherent arguments at home with my mother or sister and wept inconsolablyover matters I could not understand or explain , was a hardy and impetuous patrol leader in the beaver patrol of the Boy Scouts of America for many years and worked to earn merit badges , masturbated some more , even as a Boy Scout , and rode back and forth to my automobile casualty insurance company each working day on a very stuffy subway car crowded with tired , hostile , grimy adults who glared , sighed , snored , and sweated . That was somebody else , not me  --  I insist on that ; it exists in my memory but that 's all ; like a children'sstory ; it is way outside the concrete experience of the person I am now and was then ; it never happened  --  I do insist on that not to me ; I know I did not spend so much ofmyself doing only that ; so there must have been a second person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled in for me on occasions to experience things of which I did not wish to become a part . And there was even a third person of whom I am aware only dimly and about whom I know almost nothing , only that he is there . And I am aware of still one more person whom I am not even aware of ; and this one watches everything shrewdly , even me , from some secure hideout in my mind in which he remains invisible and anonymous , and makes stern , censorious judgments , about everything , even me . He hardly ever sleeps . I am lacking in sequence for everything but my succession of jobs , love affairs , and fornications ; and these are not important ; nonep136matters more than any of the others ; except that they do give me some sense of a connected past . Who cares if I get Kagle 's job or not ? Or if I do get into young Jane in the Art Department 's pants before Christmas or that I was never able to graduate myself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile casualty insurance company or in a bed in a hotel , although I did squeeze her good tits many times and feel the smooth inside of her thighs ? I care . I want the money . I want the prestige . I want the acclaim , the congratulations . And Kagle will care . And Green will care , and Johnny Brown will care so much he might punch me in the jaw as soon as he learns about it , and I know already I will have to begin making plans beforehand for coping with him tactfully or getting rid of him altogether , even though he 's good . But will it matter , will it make a difference ? No . Do I want it ? Yes . ( Should I want it ? Nah . But I do , I do , dammit . I do . ) And there is no mistaking , either , the fact that my daughter does honestly covet the greater freedom enjoyed by girls and boys she knows who have lost a father or a mother through accident or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Even though they do n't really seem to be enjoying it ; they just seem to have more freedom . ) " Who the hell would take care of you if we were divorced , or if we were killed in a plane or automobile accident ? " I try to explain to her tolerantly one evening during one of those " frank " ( and generally abusive ) discussions she persists in inaugurating regularly , usually when she observes that I have settled myself alone in my study to do some work or read a magazine . " You could n't live alone . You know that . Who would feed you and clean up after you , help you pick your clothes out and remind you to brush your teeth and help you keep your weight down ? You 'd have to live with someone , you know . So it might as well be us . You know , you get some pretty God-damned good things from us , too . " " I wish , " says my wife , " that you would n't swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't always have to yell . Ca n't you see you 're only scaring her ? " " Ca n't you make her keep out of it ? " says my daughter to me , sullenly , about my wife . " And I wish , " I reply to my wife " She 's always butting in. "  --  in a growl that rises menacingly . But I do n't know what I wish ( except that I damn well wish I were somewhere else ) , so I grind my jaws shut withoutcompleting my sentence . ( My voice does have a tendency to get loud whenever I am irritated , frustrated , or attacked . And I will stammer ferociously if I attempt to speak a long sentence with strong emotion . ) I wish I knew what to wish . I wish my daughter would stop complaining and feeling so sorry for herself all the time and start trying to make the best of things . She does n't think much of us . She is nervous , spiteful , embittered , and vindictive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both intensely  --  at least part of the time ( if not nearly all of the time ) . I do n't know what we have done , or failed to do , to account for it all : I do n't know what she blames us for ; but she blames us for something . ( I grow pretty damned spiteful and embittered myself at my inability to please her , at our failure to make her happy . And I often strike back at her in clever , malign ways . I enjoy strikingback at her . Revenge is sweet , even against her . And she is not yet sixteen . I sometimes find myself wishing that she would run away from home , just to make things easier for me . ) I know my daughter hates us because she makes a point of telling us so . She may hate us singly or she may hate us both together : she is versatile , my darling little girl , at least in this one respect , extremely gifted ; without straining herself unduly , she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she can begin hating him separately without apparent reason and be oblivious to us ; or she can hate Derek , his nurse , our house , our community . She can , of course , hate herself . With uncommon resourcefulness , shep138can even stop hating us for a little while , just to throw us off stride and lure us into an unguarded state of well-being that leaves us wide open for her next piercing assault . She is perverse , and proud of it . My daughter ca n't ( or wo n't ) learn chemistry , grammar , or plane geometry easily ; but she did learn how to smoke cigarettes at an early age ( even inhale , she boasts . Marijuana , too , she intimates , without being asked ) and to say motherfucker so effortlessly as to appear to have been saying it unselfconsciously to us at home all her life ; and she did learn how to hate us and say cruel things that hurt my feelings and reduce my wife to plaintive tears . It took my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant practice to learn how to hate each other with good , wholesome vigor and elation ( when we do hate each other . We do not hate each other all the time ) , but my precocious daughter has learned how to do it already . It may be a talent she has , a genuine aptitude ( if it is , it 's the only talent she has . I am often quite furious with her , but I wo n't give her the satisfaction of showing it . I am often cruelly sarcastic with her in return ) . She hates my wife much more , and much more often , than she hates me , which is ironic and unfair , because my wife loves and cares for her without limit or restraint and would lay down her life for her . ( And I would not . ) But I get my share too . ( She has enough hatred to go around . ) It does n't really bother me so much anymore that my daughter hates me ( I wo n't let it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inured to it , and I am willing to bow to her assertion that there is good reason for her hatred , although I do n't know what that good reason is ( except that I have grown inured to it , which is reason enough , I suppose ) . Usually , she will come uninvited to my study to interrupt me when I 'm working or reading a newsmagazine ( or pretending to work or read ) to tell me ( in a tense , thin , childlikevoice that she endeavors valorously to hold steady and self-assured ) that she has arrived at the conclusion ( never come to , but always arrived ) that she does n't have any realp139feelings for my wife or me any longer , thinks very little of her mother and of me too and finds it impossible to respect us , in fact , by now really dislikes us both very much ; and that , terrible as she knows it must sound , and even though she will admit that she probably ought to be ashamed of herself  --  butis n't  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really would n't be sorry if Mommy ( my wife ) were killed in an automobile accident , like Alice Harmon 's mother  --  Alice Harmon , in fact , ca n't make herself feel sorry about her mother at all  --  or if I were to get sick and die of a brain tumor , like Betsy Anderson 's father ; that she would n't actuallytake any pleasure in it , she wants me to know , and is n't actually wishing for that to happen , she wants me to understand , and might even regret it a little if it did , as she would regret it if it happened to anyone she knew , but she just does n't think it would be the biggest tragedy in her life if I did get a stroke or a brain tumor , provided I died quickly and did n't need someone to take care of me for a long time , like some of those people who have brain tumors or strokes and go on living like vegetables , and is not saying all this just to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is only saying so because that just happens to be the way she feels , and she knows I want to know the way she really feels  --  do n't I ?  --  because I am her father and she is my daughter . And then , if I have let her progress that far ( sometimes I cut her off gruffly as soon as she begins and kick her out right then ) , she might volunteer the information ( again ) , with that same affected air of casual , unmotivated reflection ( still struggling to keep her small voice from wavering and her trembling fingers from picking at things ) that if my wife and I ever do get divorced , as she knows we have considered doing , and feels we should consider doing , since we are not so happy together anyway and are not very much alike , she does n't think she would want to have to live with either one of us but would prefer to be sent away to boarding school , like Christine Murray , who is very happy now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her parents anymore , or evenp140maybe to school in Switzerland , where she knows she will be content . In fact , she has arrived at the conclusion by now that she would be much better off living away from us , anyway , even if we do n't get a divorce , and that we would probably be much happier without her too , since she can tell we do n't really want her there . Would n't we ? Sometimes ( with spiteful goals of my own ) I will hear her through with the silence of a stone , letting her go on this way for as long as she is able , saying absolutely nothing and gazing at her all the while with a heavy expression that yields no flicker of emotion , forcing her to go on and on with increasingdismay and befuddlement ( although I look at her , she must wonder if I am listening to her , if I hear her ) as the smug , malevolent composure with which she entered crumblesaway into terrified misgivings and she is left , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausted , bereft of all her former confidence and determination . ( I can outfox her every time . ) And then ( when she has run out of all things to say and I know I have outfoxed her ) if I maintain my silence and continue to stare at her oppressivelywith my dull , heavy , unresponsive look , she might stammer lamely , in a final , desperate attempt at bravado that fails : " I 'm only trying to be frank with you . " And then , with victory palpably before me , I might decide to speak ; I might decide to move in skillfully for my own attack , simulating an air of smug composure that seeks mockingly to impersonate her own . " No , " I will say enigmatically . ( And this will confuse her . ) " No what ? " she must ask . " No , you 're not . " " Not what ? " she is forced to inquire , timid and suspiciousnow .

What do you mean ? " " Do n't you know what I mean ? " I inquire with cool , invigoratingvengeance . She shakes her head . " What I mean is that you are n't trying to be frank and that you are trying to say the most shocking and outrageous things you can think of in order to hurt my feelings and make me angry at you . " " Why would I do that ? " " Angry enough to yell and begin punishing you . " " Why would I do that ? " " Because that 's the way you are . " " Why would I want you to punish me ? " " Because that is the way you are . Do n't you see ? And that 's the way you want me to feel . Do n't you see that ? Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " " That 's what I mean . " " It 's a matter of supreme indifference to me , " she rejoinsloftily , " how you feel . " " Then why bother , " I mimic just as loftily , " to tell me at all ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean that if how I feel is really a matter of such supremeindifference to you , why bother to ever talk to me at all ? " " What should I do ? " " Unless you want something . " " And you wonder why I bite my nails and ca n't sleep well and why I eat too much . " " Do n't blame your eating too much on me . " " What about the rest ? " " I eat too much also . " " You do n't think very much of me , " she alleges . " Do you ? " " Not right now . How much do you think of yourself ? " " I was only trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want me to be honest , do n't you ? " " No . " " You do n't ? " " Of course not . Why should I ? " An unexpected answer like that always outfoxes her , strikes her speechless for a few moments , makes her stammer and regret even further that she came barging into my study so rashly in the first place to start up with me . If she tries to continue the contest , her voice will drop to a diffident murmur that is almost too faint to be heard ( I will pretend not to hear any of it and make her repeat each remark ) ; or she will explodesuddenly in a snarling , unintelligible , dramatic outburst and storm away in total defeat , banging some furniture or slamming a door . ( I can outfox her easily every time . ) But she never seems to learn ( or she has learned and is drawn self-destructively to repeat these same cheerless defeats ) , so we go through innumerable repetitions of these same annoying , time-wasting , belittling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat . And getting bald . And I strike back by being faster , keener , and better informed in my repartee ) " frank " and " honest " disputes with each other ( I manage to win them all , although I sometimes feel wounded afterward ) over money , smoking , sex , marijuana , late hours , dirty words , schoolwork , drugs , Blacks , freedom ( hers ) , yelling , bullying , and insults to my wife . " What will you do , " she will ask baitingly , " if I come home with a Black boyfriend ? " This is a peculiarly ingenious stroke of hers that requireslightning dexterity to counter and with which she does succeed in confounding and vanquishing my wife . There is no way out , and I am tempted to award her accolades : if I tell her I 'd object , I 'm a racist ; if I tell her I would n't , I have no regard for her . My wife succumbs by taking her seriously . I survive by skirting the trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your room , " I replyp143nimbly . " And to stop reading my mail and showing my bank statements to your friends . " Of course I 'm a racist ! And so is she . Who the devil is n't ? " That 's not answering the question , " she is intelligent enough to sulk . " And you know it . " " Bring one home and see , " I challenge her with a snicker , because I know she is not ready to try that one on us yet . She wants me to promise her now that she 'll have her own car . She is willing to promise she 'll give up smoking cigarettes in return . I used to order her not to smoke because of the risk of cancer , until I grew so weary of bickering with her over that subject that I stopped caring whether she smoked or not , despite the risk of cancer . ( I did my best for a while as a responsible parent . And it did no good . ) So now she smokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ( she says ) , but I do n't believe her , for she could be lying about that too . ( She lies about everything . She lies to her teachers too . ) But she is not allowed to smoke in the house , which makes it easier for my wife and me to pretend that she does n't smoke at all . And perhaps she does n't . ( Really , who cares ? I do n't . And I do n't like to have to feel forced to pretend to . If she did n't tell us , I would n't have to . ) " I do smoke , " she insists . " I even inhale . I guess it 's a regular habit with me by now . I do n't think I could stop smoking cigarettes now even if I wanted to . " " It 's your life , " I answer placidly . " Over a pack a day , sometimes two . I know you would n't want me to be a sneak about anything like that , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do . " " You would ? " " Of course . " " A sneak ? " " Yes . "  | " What do you mean ? " Her eyes cloud with uncertainty and her mouth begins to quiver . I have just outfoxed her again . " I do want you to be a sneak . " I continue breezily , and zero in for the kill . " About smoking , and all those dirty , really very vulgar words and phrases you 're so fond of using so openly . " " You use them . " " I 'm an adult . And a man . " " Mommy uses them . " " Not the same ones you do . " " Mommy 's a prude . " " You 're a child . " " I 'm sixteen . " " You 're fifteen and a half . " " I 'm nearer to sixteen . " " So ? " " Ca n't you say anything more than that ? " " Like what ? " " You always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's a good trick . " " It is . " " You 're so sarcastic . " " Be a sneak , " I tell her sarcastically . " I 'm not being sarcastic now . It will make things easier for all of us . I give you that advice as a pal , as a really devoted father to a young daughter . Sneak outside on the porch or into the garage when you want to smoke or burn that crappy incense or do somethingelse you do n't want us to know about . And close the door of your room when you 're on the telephone so we wo n't have to listen to you complain about us to all of your friends or see those crappy sex novels you read instead of the books you 're supposed to be reading for school . You can get away with much more that way . By being a good sneak . Just do n't let me find out about it . Because if I do find out , I 'm going to have to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get angry and punish you , and other things like that , and that will make you unhappy and me unhappy . " " Why will it make you unhappy ? " she wants to know . " Because you 're my daughter . And I really do n't enjoy seeing you unhappy . " " Really ? " " Yes . " " Ha . " " And because I do n't like to waste so much time fighting with you and yelling at you when I have other things I 'd rather be doing . " " Like what ? " " Anything . " " What ? " " Working . Reading a magazine . " " Why must you say that ? Why must you be this way ? " ( I do n't know . ) " What way ? " " You know . " " I do n't . " ( I do . ) " Why ca n't you ever pay me a compliment without takingit back ? " " What compliment ? " " You always have to have the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " See ? " " I 'm not going to say another word . " " Now you 're trying to turn the whole thing into a big joke , are n't you ? " she says reprovingly . " You always have to try to turn everything into a big joke , do n't you ? " ( I 'm contrite . I feel a little bit shamed . But I try not to let it show . ) " Let me work now , " I tell her quietly . " I want to talk . " " Please . I was working when you came in . " " You were reading a magazine . " " That 's part of my work . And I have to prepare a pro/gram for the next company convention and work on two speeches . " " Where is it ? The convention . " " Puerto Rico again . " " Can I help with the speeches ? " " No , I do n't think so . Not yet . " " Is it more important than me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done tonight . " " I want to talk now . " " Not now . " " Why ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " No . " " You never want to talk to me . " " Please get out now . " ( I know by now that I do n't have too much in common with children , not even with my own , and that I dislike getting involved in long conversations with them . I really do n't enjoy children for more than a couple of minutes at a time . It is difficult for me to keep interested in what they say and difficult for me to think of things to say that might interestthem . So I no longer try . ) Sometimes , when my daughter is in buoyant spirits ( for some reason ) and feeling exceptionallystrong and sure of herself , she will sweep into my study audaciously without any pretext or apology and , as though she and I were commonly on the most familiar terms , settle herself imperiously on my couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining to me about my wife , grossly miscalculating my response , assuming mistakenly , I guess , that because my wife and I fight so much , I will welcome her allegiance . ( I do n't allow her to speak disrespectfully about my wife ; she ought to know that by now . ) It used to be that when my daughter was small , and it sounded so beguiling and precocious , I would encourage her to find fault with my wife ( my wife would delight in this also , because my daughter really was so bright and entertaining ) ,  |p147which  may be one reason she reverts to it so frequently now . But I do n't like it now ; and I will defend my wife ( even when my daughter 's complaints and unflattering comments are accurate and justified ) . Or I will cut her off curtly almost as soon as she begins , and kick her out with a stern admonition . My daughter 's impression about me is correct : there are times when I simply do n't want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My boy is always easier to take  --  everybody says that . He is more straightforward and generous and much more likable ; unlike my daughter , and me , he never rejoices in the misfortunes of other people ; instead , he grows grave and worried in the presence of anything woeful , watching always to ascertain if any in the ungovernablewhirl of events around him pose any danger to his own existence . ) There are times now when I 'm plain fed up with her , when I have had all I am able to take , when I just do n't want to hear my daughter tell me one more time that I 'm no good as a father and my wife is no good as a mother , that the home is no good as a home and the family no good as a family , and that Derek ( our idiot child , of course ) and all the rest of us are spoiling her life , even though it all might be true . So what ? What if it all is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father was much worse , ha , ha . He was hardly around at all after he died . Ha , ha . ) Maybe it is my fault that she does so poorly at school and lacks confidence in herself and bites her fingernails and does n't sleep well , and even my fault that she eats too much and is heavy and is having a boring and excruciating time of it . But , so what ? ( I 've got my excuses ready too . ) What good does it do anyone to know that ? Even if I agree ( and I often do agree , just to frustrate and befuddle her ) , it does n't change anything , it does n't make anything easier for her . So why must she dwell on it ? It has grown so boring by now  --  it never leads anywhere  --  just plain boring to the point of maddening irritation ( which is obviouslyall she hopes to achieve with me now , all she feels now that she can obtain from life , to goad me ruthlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ip148stammer , spit , bellow , and launch myself into blustering denunciationsthat can not be concluded with dignified grammaticalcoherence , and which are enough to bring that detestable , unmistakable glint of baleful satisfaction into her cunning eyes ) . ( What does she want from me ? ) " You know , " she might begin with deceptive tranquillity , " I really do n't think I have anything in common with Mommy anymore . And I do n't think you have , either . I do n't know why you still stay married to her . I know you 're incompatible . " ( She does n't even know what incompatible means . ) If I do ( to her enormous surprise and chagrin ) cut her off right then and kick her out of my study , it is not improbablethat she will go straight to my wife ( pals with her , all at once ) and begin complaining to her about me ! ( And she , of course , is the one who never wants to be a sneak ! ) And then my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will come barging back into my study unsuspectinglyto take up the cudgels for her , emboldened in her adventureby her sense of mercy . My daughter , smiling surreptitiously , will lurk in the background , anticipating with gleaming relish the fight that she hopes will now break out between my wife and me . ( My boy , on the other hand , is appalledwhen any two of us quarrel and always looks unnervedand nauseated . ) It is my daughter 's brazen look of gloating expectation , I think , more than anything else , that inevitably fills me with rage , and with a vicious need to retaliate . " She says , " my wife says , " that you kicked her out of your study just now . She says she came in here to talk to you and you would n't listen to her . She says you never want to listen to her . You made her get out before she could even say anything . " I hold my breath for a second or two and pretend to meditate . " Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh-huh . " " Did n't you ? " " He did . " " Uh-huh . " " Did he ? " " Why would I say so ? " " Uh-huh . " " Well ? " " Well ? " " Yes . " " What ? " " You just heard her , did n't you ? You kicked her out . " " Is that right ? " I ask my daughter tonelessly , staring at her with a look of frigid scorn . " Did n't you ? " " And did she also chance to tell you , " I say to my wife , " what it was she wanted to talk to me about ? " " That is n't fair ! " my daughter blurts out in alarm . Her startled gaze shoots to the doorway as though she wishes she could run out . " No . " " Oh . " " What ? " " I kind of thought she might have been careless enough to leave that out . That she would n't mind very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't tell you that ? " " That 's not true ! " my daughter cries . " Or that she really does n't think she would care very much if you or I got killed in an automobile or plane crash , like Alice **34;1177;TOOLONG Harmon 's mother , or passed away from a stroke or a brain tumor . " " I did n't say that ! " " You could . " " I did n't . " " You have . " " That is n't what I wanted to talk about ! " " I know . What she does want to talk to me about is thatp150she does n't think you and I have anything in common and wonders why I continue to stick it out with you instead of getting a divorce . Is that it ? " " I only began that way . " " No ? Then let 's continue . What was it , then , that you did want to talk to me about ? " " Oh , never mind , " my daughter mumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " I persist . " I want to . I want to give you that chance to talk to me you always say I never do . " " Why ca n't you leave her alone now ? " my wife demands . " She 's trying to tear us apart , my dear . Do n't you see ? " " Why ca n't we all be nice to each other ? " my wife wondersaloud imploringly out of the innate goodness of herheart . " Must I listen to a sentence like that ? " " What 's wrong with it ? " my wife retorts sharply . " What 's wrong with wishing we would all try to get along once in a while instead of picking on each other all the time ? " " We do n't pick ' on each other all the time , " my daughter interjects condescendingly in a tone of sulky contempt ( trying to insinuate herself back onto my side in opposition to my wife ) . I am familiar with this tactic of hers . She flicks her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let her succeed . I ignore the overture . ( That 's what my wife 's innate goodness of heart gets her . ) " I 'm tired , " I remark deliberately with an exaggerated sigh . " That 's because you drink too much before  --  " " I 'm tired , " I interrupt resolutely , letting my voice get louder in order to drown out my wife 's , " of listening to you tell me I drink too much before I come home , and listening to her tell me over and over again how bad you and I are and how much she hates me . I 've got better ways to spend my time . Let her hate me . Hate me if you want to , and if youp151think it solves your problems for you . You 've got my permission . I do n't care if she hates me . But I do mind , God dammit , if she comes in here to tell me about it every Goddamnedtime I sit down in here and try to do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's my work . " " She does n't hate you ! " my wife declares . " What do I care ? " I answer . " It 's a matter of supreme indifference to me whether she hates me or not . " " And you 're supposed to be so intelligent ! " my wife exclaims . " What does that mean ? " " She wants you to pay some attention to her once in a while . Ca n't you see that ? And you 're supposed to be so intelligent . " " Will you stop that ? " " You think you 're always so smart , do n't you ? " " Stop . " " All right . But if you 'd only take the trouble to look at her once in a while , and listen to her , you 'd see she does n't hate you . She loves you . You never even show you know . " " Okay . " " You make her feel like a nuisance . " " Okay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay ! " " Okay . " I turn to stare at my daughter searchingly , my face still hard and scornful and belligerent ( my defenses are up until I can make certain hers are down ) . She is standing perfectly still , as though meekly awaiting a verdict . I am awaiting some sign from her . She looks humble and penitent . She is alone . Her downcast eyes are grave and moist , and her ashen lips are pinched together sadly and are twitching , as though , despite all the forces of will she has amassed to hold her poor self together , she is going to collapse into shambles before us and begin crying helplessly , without pride . She is tense . Myp152feelings soften with a sensation of irremediable loss ( of something precious gone forever , of someone dear destroyed ) as I study her pale , drooping , vulnerable face . I am tense too . I am unable to speak ( maybe I do love her ) , and for a second I am struck with the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't hate me and does love me , and perhaps does need to have me know it ( and needs to know also , perhaps , that maybe I think well of her ) . And I begin to feel that maybe I do care very much whether she hates me or not ! ( I do n't want her to ! ) She must matter to me , I think , for I am nearly overcome with grief and pity by her look of tearful misery ( and I want to cry myself ) , and I want to put my arms out to her shoulders to hold her gently and console her and confess and apologize ( even though I have a vivid premonitionsuddenly that it is all a typical trick , that she will pull away from me in a taunting , jubilant affront as soon as I do reach out to comfort her , leaving me standing there ridiculouslywith my empty hands outstretched in the air , abashed and infuriated ) . I decide to risk it anyway  --  she is so pathetic and forlorn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smiling tenderly , stepping toward her repentently , I reach my hands out to take her in my arms , apologize , and hug her gently . She pulls away from me with a vicious sneer . And I find myself standing there stupidly with my empty hands in the air , feeling hurt and foolish . And my wife picks exactly that moment to cry : " I 'm the one she hates ! Not you ! I 'm the one she ca n't stand ! " And I turn around to gape at her incredulously . ( I had forgotten she was even there . ) " Do n't you ever hear her ? " my wife continues stridently , and runs toward my daughter as though she intends to smack her . My daughter flinches , but holds her ground steadily , glaring insultingly up into my wife 's eyes with stubborn defiance , daring her , with a small , cold smile , to do more . " What have I ever done to you ? " my wife shouts at her . " What havep153I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? Look at her ! Do n't you see the way she 's looking at me right now ? " " Christ , yes ! " I shout back at my wife . " What the hell do you think I was talking about ? Why the hell do you think I kick her out ? " " And you  --  you 're no better ! " my wife accuses me . " You do n't care either , do you ? " " Oh , Jesus ! " I wail . " Nobody in this house gives a damn about me , " my wife laments . " Nobody ever loved me . Not in my whole life . Not even my own mother . Am I so horrible ? What did I ever do to you or anyone else that you should all hate me so much ? What makes me so horrible that you should all feel you can treat me this way ? Tell me . " " Oh , shit ! " I groan disgustedly . " Do n't talk to me that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in rotten conversationlike this ? " " What 's so rotten about me ? " " Nothing . " " What do I do that 's so horrible ? " And I find myself wondering once again just what in the mystifying hell an able , well-read , fairly intelligent , sensitive , personable , successful minor organization executive like myself , sound in health ( if not in tooth ) , provocative in wit , still virile and still attractive to many susceptible ladiesmy own age and much younger , is doing engaged seriouslyin such a low , directionless argument with two such people ( children ) as them , my shallow , melancholy , slightly inebriated , self-pitying wife ( I often try to figure out what it was I ever saw in her so long ago that made me think I loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her , except her good and willing ass , which is still not so had and now even more willing . All in all , in fact , in the long run , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the others , although most of the ones I have gone with a second time or more have been pretty good , too , andp154full of very surprising surprises , for a while . Jane in the Art Department will be a headache  --  I sense that already ; she is gullible and unsophisticated and she likes to talk ; her skin will be so clear and smooth it will almost hum to my touch , but she is still too young and pleasant , or simpleminded , to make much sense to me now . Some girls laugh a bit too loudly at just about everything amusing I say and drive me batty , between erections , once I recognize they laugh so readily and talk too much . That will be young , sweet , pleasant Jane . I know her already . But I also know I will grab for it lecherously at the next company party or sooner ; and that I do n't think I will want her to keep on working there with me after I do : she is a present I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , and I am already in the process of wrapping her up ) and my depressing , self-centered , self-pitying daughter , when I would much rather be concentrating on something else , on those two speeches I want to begin outlining ( I like to get started on important things well in advance , on a long convention speech in case I am moved up into Kagle 's job by then and am nominally in charge of the whole affair , and on my customary , unexciting , three-minute speech about the plans and activities of my department in case I am not moved up into Kagle 's job and am still working for Green , who probablywo n't let me give it this time , either . I hate Green and will never forgive him or forget him for what he did to me at the convention by not letting me speak . I really do n't want Andy Kagle 's job  --  I never did want to do that kind of work or have power over so many people  --  but I will be heartbroken now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel betrayedand disgraced , and I will want to slink away alone into someplace dark and weep and never come out . I am too weak to refuse it , and too vain to be indifferent to the honor . I do n't even really need the extra money ) and on the list of changes I will want to recommend when I am promoted into Kagle 's job . ( I will want to show Arthur Baron and Horace White that I am ready . There are peoplep155in nearly all our offices I will want to be rid of . I wish I could be rid of Green now , although I do n't know who could replace him . ) " Tell me , " my wife repeats shrilly . " What do I do ? " " You give me , " I answer , " a pain in the ass . Both of you !

" Do n't yell at me , " my wife snaps . " I was n't yelling , " I explain . " I was speaking emphat-ically . " " I can yell too , you know . " " You are . " " And do n't say things like that to me , not in front of the children . Ever again . I do n't care how you talk to me when we 're alone . " " Like what ? " " What you said . " " Then stop being one . " " You 're so clever . " " I know . " " It 's no wonder they use such filthy language , when they listen to you . It 's no wonder they talk to me the way they do .

" " I 'll find one . " " I wish I had money of my own . " " I 'll give it to you . " " That 's some way , " my daughter observes softly in a petulant tone , " for a father to talk to a fifteen-year-old child . " " Go  --  " I begin ( and pause to conceal a smile , for her reproof is humorous and ingratiating , and I am tempted to laugh and congratulate her ) "  --  away to boarding school .

I am nearly ecstatic with grievance , and I forge ahead vigorously in joyouspursuit of revenge ) . " Yes , I get piercing headaches from all those brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages you keep giving me . And stabbing chest pains from all the heart attacksyou keep telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would feel unhappy if I got one ! In fact , I 'm starting to feel pretty damned miserable from having to listen to both of you tell me all the time how miserable you feel .

I feel so sorry for myself it is almost unbearably delicious . I also feel mighty : I feel potent and articulate , and part of me wishes that Green or someone else I yearn to impress , like Jane , or Horace White , or perhaps some terriblyrich and famous beauty with marvelous tits and glossy hair , were in a position to witness me so fluent and dominating ) . " I 'm sick , " I remark misleadingly in a falling voice , just to puzzle them further a moment . " Yes , by now I am sick and tired of having both of you people come barging in here , into my study , whenever you feel like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father you think I am . " " You were reading a magazine , " my wife remarks . " You too ? " I jeer . " We 're going .

Out of my study . My eyes fill with tears ; I do n't know why ; they are tears not of anger but of injured pride . It 's a tantrum , and I am obliged to give myself up to it unresistingly. )  | " I 'll go ! " I cry , as both of them stare at me in bafflement . I stride toward the door with tears of martyred grief . " And stop sneaking these extra chairs in , " I add , with what sounds like a sniffle . " What ? " " You know what I mean . And all of you always take all my pencils and never bring them back . " " What are you talking about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs in here . As though I wo n't notice . " My wife is bewildered . And I am pleased . ( I am enjoying my fit exquisitely . I am still a little boy . I am a deserted little boy I know who will never grow older and never change , who goes away and then comes back . He is badly bruised and very lonely . He is thin . He makes me sad whenever I remember him . He is still alive , yet out of my control . This is as much as he ever became . He never goes far and always comes back . I ca n't help him . Between us now there is a cavernous void . He is always nearby . ) And when I whirl away again exultantly to storm out , leaving my silent wife and daughter standing there , in my study , at such a grave moral disadvantage , I see my son watching in the doorway . And I stamp on him before I can stop . " Ow ! " he wails . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there stealthily , taking everything in . " It 's okay ! " he assures me breathlessly . Clutching his foot , hopping lamely on the other , he shrinks away from me against the doorjamb , as though I had stepped on him on purpose , and intend to step on him again . " Did I hurt you ? " I demand . " It 's okay . " " But did I hurt you ? I 'm sorry . "  | " It 's okay ! I mean it . It does n't hurt ! " " I did n't mean to step on you . Then why are you rubbing your ankle ? " " Because you hurt me a little bit . Before . But it 's okay now . I mean it . Really , it 's okay . " ( He is supplicating anxiouslyfor me to believe he is okay , pleading with me to stop pulverizing him beneath the crushing weight of my overwhelmingsolicitude . " Leave me alone  --  please ! " is what I realize he is actually screaming at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge that . I take a small step back . ) " See ? " he asks timorously , and demonstrates . He puts his foot to the floor and tests it gingerly , proving to me he is able to stand without holding on . I see a minute bruise on the surface of his skin , a negligible , white scrape left by the edge of my shoe , a tiny laceration of the dermatologicaltissue covering the ankle , no injury of any seriousness . ( He is probably the only person in the world for whom I would do almost anything I could to shield from all torment and harm . Yet I fail continually ; I ca n't seem to help him , I do seem to harm him . Things happen to him over which I have no power and of which I am often not even aware until the process has been completed and the damage to him done . In my dreams sometimes he is in mortal danger , and I can not move quickly enough to save him . My thighs weigh tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy , in my dreams , is always mine . In real life , he is suffering already from secret tortures he is reluctant to divulge , and from so many others he is unable to comprehend and describe . He is afraid of war and crime . Anyone in uniform intimidates him . He is afraid of stealing : he is afraid to steal anything and afraid of having things stolen from him . ) He seems out of breath and waxen with fright as he stands below me now watching me stand there watching him ( the delicate oval pods beneath his eyes are a pathological blue ) , and he is trembling in such violent consternation as he waits for me to do something that it seems he must certainly shake himself into broken little pieces if I do n't reach out instantly to hold him together . ( Ip160do n't reach out . I have that sinking , intuitive feeling again that if I do put my hand out toward him , he will think I am going to hit him and fall back from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often that I am going to hit him when I never do ; I never have ; I do n't know why both he and my daughter believe I used to beat them a great deal when they were smaller , when I do n't believe I ever struck either one of them at all . My boy can hurt me in so many ways he does n't suspect and against which I have no strength to defend myself . Or maybe he does suspect . And does do it with motive . When I think of him , I think of me . ) And I know why he is quaking now , squirming awkwardly and plucking nervously and obliviouslyat the small bulge of penis inside his pants as though he is tingling to urinate . I know I must have seemed enormous to him as I spun wrathfully to storm away and stamped down blindly upon him . I must have seemed inhuman , gigantic , like that monstrous , dark , hairy , splayfooted tyrant ( that flying cock elsewhere is not the only fur-bearing blot ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then what are you looking so unhappy about ? " I want to know timidly . " If it does n't hurt . " " Your yelling . " " I 'm not yelling . " " You were yelling . Before . " " I 'm not yelling now . I was n't even yelling at you , " I argue with comic fervor , trying to appease him . I want to make him smile too . ( I ca n't stand to see him upset , particularlywhen I am the cause . I smother furious impulses against him when he fails to be as fully content with life and me as I would like him to be . ) " Was I ? " " No , " he replies without hesitation , twisting in one place again ( as though he would like to wrest his feet free from the floor and fly away ) and patting his knees spasmodically with fluttering palms . " But you 're going to yell at me , " he guesses cagily , with a gleam of insight in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , no , " I assure him . " I 'm not going to yell at you . "  | " You will . I know you will . " " I wo n't . Why should I yell at you ? " " You see ? I told you . " " I 'm not . " " You 're yelling already . " " I 'm not yelling ! " " Ai n't he yelling ? " " I do n't think he knows what he 's doing . " " That 's good , " I compliment my wife acidly . " That will cool things down . " " You know you 're impossible ? " she answers . " Whenever you get this way . " " I 'm possible . " " He 's possible , " my daughter intones ruefully . " Are you going to yell at me now ? " my boy asks . " I 'm not going to yell at you at all , " I tell him . " I was speaking loudly only to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , forcing myself to smile and imposing on my words a scrupulous and conciliatory calm . I squat to my heels directly in front of him , bringing my face almost to a level with his own , and look instructively into his eyes . He lets me take his hands . Tissues inside his hands , I feel , are beating and lurching like little fishes . ( Everybody in my family trembles at home but me , even though I do n't want them to . I brood and sulk and moan a good deal and wish I were someplaceelse . I tremble elsewhere . At the office . In my sleep . Alone at airports waiting for planes . In unfamiliar hotel rooms in cities I do n't like , unless I drink myself sodden and have some girl or woman I can stand who is able to spend most of the night with me . I do n't like being alone at night and always leave a small light on when I have to be . Being dead tired does n't help ; in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounder and my defenses are low and laggard . Repulsive thoughts swarm over them and invade my mind like streams of lice or other small , beetle-brown , biting insects or animals , and I am slow to choke them off and force them back down where they came from . There is this animal , Ip162sometimes imagine , that creeps up on paws in the night when my eyes are closed and eats at my face  --  but that 's another childish story . My dreams are demoralizing . I wo n't reveal them . I have castration fears . I have castration dreams . I had a dream once of my mother with black mussels growing on her legs , and now I know what it meant . ) " Please do n't be afraid of me , " I urge him tenderly , almost begging . " I 'm not going to do anything to hurt you or scare you . Now or ever . " " It 's okay , " he says , trying to comfort me . " You can trust me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm speaking softly . Ai n't I ? " He nods mistrustfully ( and I want to raise my voice and begin yelling at him again to make him believe I never yell at him at all . But I do n't . I do n't want to scare him again . I do n't ever really want to frighten any of them and am always sorry and disgusted with myself afterward when I do . Almost always . But only after I succeed in bullying them ; if I try to bully them and fail , I am distraught . And frightened . I am sorry now that I have just intimidated them all ; and in speaking to my boy , I am trying to apologize to my wife and daughteras well . I want them to see I am sorry ; but I do n't want to say so . I want to be forgiven ) . " Why do you look that way ? " I ask him , in a troubled , slightly nagging voice ( pleading with him to relax and feel free and safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so worried ? " " It 's okay . " " You can trust me , " I promise . " It 's just the way I look . " " And I was n't yelling at you before , either , " I continue uncontrollably . " Sometimes when a person raises his voice and speaks loudly , it is n't because he 's yelling at you or even angry , but only because he wants you to believe what he 's saying . He does it for . . . emphasis . He wants to be . . . emphatic . That 's what the word emphatic means . " I pause in annoyance as I see my boy catch my daughter 's eyes for an instant and then roll his gaze upward with a dramatic look ofp163tedium ( as both my children are apt to do ostentatiously when one of us is lecturing them at length for doing something we deem hazardous , or inundating them with unnecessary directionsor repetitious questions . I would rather have him bored with me now and making fun than panic-stricken . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although my dignity was offended for a second ) . " Now that 's what I was doing when I raised my voice a bit before , " I continue . " I was being . . . emphatic . I wanted you to believe that I was n't going to yell at you and that I was n't angry with you . And it was exactly the same when I was speaking with them , " I lie . " I was n't yelling at them , either . " " I know , " he says . " I know it now . " " And I 'm not yelling at you now , am I ? " " No . " " So I was right , was n't I ? " " Yes . It 's okay . " " Good . I 'm glad you understand . And that 's why ... " I conclude wryly , with a smile  --  and somehow I know he guesses the joke I 'm about to make and that he is going to interrupt and make it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... you yelled at me ! " he says . " Right ! " I guffaw . ( Our minds are very much alike , his and mine , in our humor and our forebodings . ) " Do I , " he ventures ahead boldly on his wave of success , with a sidelong glance at my wife that glitters with impish intent , " give you a pain in the ass , too ? " " Oh , my ! " I exclaim . ( My first impulse is to guffaw again ; my next is to protect him from any sanctimonious reproof that might come from my wife for his using the word ass . Quickly , clowning , laughing , mugging with grossly burlesqued alarm , before my wife can react at all , I cry : ) " Now , she 's going to yell at you ! " " She 's not ! " " No ? " " Are you ? "  |p164But  my wife is glad ( not mad ) and laughs merrily with relief ( because she sees I am glad now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter anymore ) . " No , but you 're a devil and a rascal , " she upbraids him affectionately . " Because you knew I would n't yell at you this time if you said that word . " " What word ? " asks my boy , with a feigned look of innocence . " Ass ? " " Do n't say it again ! " " Ass ? " " You 're not going to make me say it ! " " What ? Ass ? " asks my daughter , joining in friskily . " I give up . " My wife throws her arms out mirthfully in exasperation . " What am I going to do with them ? " " Say ass , " I advise . " Ass ! " my wife blares obligingly , extending her face out toward both of them like an elephant 's trunk . They roar with gulping laughter . " Ass ! Ass , ass , ass , ass , ass ! " All of them are laughing hysterically now . My daughter is unable to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released so unexpectedly , without penalty , from the excoriating conflict she had devised and in which she had so swiftly found herself the tortured victim . She falls against my boy joyously ; they hug each other with immense delight and go staggering wildly all about my study , bumping into us and each other and into the superfluous chairs my wife keeps sneaking in when she has no better place to put them . My boy is pleased with himselfbeyond measure , beside himself with glee and ecstasy at having used his dirty word with impetuous imagination and gotten away with it and at having transported us all to a spirit of warmth and generous good feeling from the savage rancor with which we had been smashing each other . We are close now , intimate , respectful , and informal . The children bump and hug each other and continue to laugh hilariously . I watch them with affection ( feeling complacent and benign ) . I am glad they are mine.  | " They 're really such good kids , " my wife murmurs pensivelyin my ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agreement , feeling wistful and pleased ( with myself , too , and with her ) . I slip my arm around her waist and draw her to my side . She moves willingly , her body limber , and fits herself against me compliantly . I get an erection . ( I would lay her now if we were alone . We would lay each other . ) I slide my hand down over her ass and follow the curve in at the bottom toward her box . She stretches away . " Later , " she cautions guardedly . " No , now , " I demand , teasing . " You 're crazy . " " I might not have it later . " " You will . You 'd better , " she laughs . " I 'll see that you do . " I laugh too . And that is the needful service performed for us so regularly and artlessly by this angelic little boy of mine ( " He is n't real , " my daughter has complained about him enviously . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , who is no better off than the rest of us ( who may be considerably worse off , in fact , because he is only nine and has already been frightened of just about everything , heights and kidnapping , sharks , crabs , drunks , adults who stare , sheriffs , unkempt handymen , wars , Italians , and me . He is n't afraid of monsters or ghosts so much , because monsters and ghosts are silly . He is afraid of human beings . He veers away from cripples . He welcomes the phenomenon of cops , because he has the dim hope they will safeguard him from all the rest , even from me ) , to draw us together again by reminding us who we are and what we know of each other , to stop the three of us just in time and snake us step back  --  by evoking and recalling to us the great need and capacity for affection each of us has hidden away very deep inside , like a yawning wound , affection for him , and perhaps for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irreparably , with much malice and happinessaforethought , if we have not maimed each other permanentlyalready . I believe he pulls us together as a family and keeps us together . ( I often think of leaving and always have . My daughter ca n't wait to get away , or says she ca n't . ) I think we will fall apart as a family when he grows up and moves away . ( I love him so much I just know he is going to die . ) " You like him more than me , " my daughter has said . " No , " I answered , lying , because I do not always wish to outfox her , and because she sometimes seems so barren of hope that I find myself grieving silently alongside her , as though at an open coffin or grave in which her future is lying dead already . ( She is not yet sweet sixteen , but it sometimes seems to both of us that she has already missed all boats . When ? ) " But you must admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more likable . " " I know . " They are not so funny to us while they are taking place , these corrosive family arguments that my daughter provokes so malignantly , and they do not always end in bedroom trysts for me and my wife and gales of gleeful laughter for the children . They are excruciating , especially for her . I wish she would write book reports instead , or do complicated jigsawpuzzles with one thousand pieces when she finds herself with lots of time and no exciting way to spend it . ( I wish she would fall in love or something . ) But she ca n't stop . ( It 's her compulsion . ) She must continue to agitate , like some dark and moody burrowing creature with a drive to undermine and destroy . I ( we ) do not know what it is she wants that she feels we can give her ( she wants to be beautiful , willowy , brilliant , famous , rich , and talented  --  and who can blame her ? We would like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we do n't insist ) , and she does not tell us . She does not know . Sometimes she confides in us without belligerence or guile . She con/fesses . She stands before us listlessly , her head bowed in disgrace , and , in words that force their way out from her soul and flow from her lips in a low , pining , abject monotone , she says : " I have nothing to do . " It breaks my wife 's heart when my daughter has nothing to do . I will not let it break mine . My daughter bites her fingernails , and I suppose that is my fault too . ( At least it 's something to do . My boy has poor posture , and so do I. ) She began biting her nails around the age of five . My boy used to suck his thumb in his sleep and raised a swollen white lump ( it was the color of fungus or peeling , dead skin ) on the joint of his finger that handicapped him at play and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . We could n't make him stop . We put casings of evil-odored bandages on his thumb at bedtime , but he sucked at it anyway . We even tried the vile-tasting liquid we had used without avail years before to discourage my daughter from biting her fingernails . That did n't work , either , so she still bites them . I do n't know how he finally stopped : I do n't know how he ever made himself stop doing things in his sleep . ( Often , I can stop unpleasant dreams from developing by bounding wide awake alertly at their first portentous overturesas though in response to some well-recognized primal alarm  --  like a good censor or movie director I can yell " Cut ! " at the first specter of something askew in my dream scripts and make them start all over again in another direction . The words I actually speak to myself are " Oh , no ! None of that again "  --  and keeping guard vigilantly over my slumbering intelligence until my dreams rewrite themselves into scenesp168and themes that are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall back into sleep , and give them free rein . I can stop these unwelcome dreams from proceeding only if they start as I am sifting down into sleep and am still in touch with myself . Often , I can not ; and I lie in darkness like a limbless baby while they run their ruthless course through me rampantly as though I were a helpless and disembodied mind , or this tiny , armless , legless baby still imprisoned motion- ' lessly in a cradle or womb . I ca n't bear them . I forget them . They leave traces . I have them often . I have them whenever I want them . ) ( I know so many things I 'm afraid to find out . ) She is a poor sleeper , my daughter , and , except for shortlived , unfounded spells of euphoric gaiety and plan-making ( which flare so suddenly and extravagantly as to seem almost feverish ) , prefers to cling to the tragic view she takes of her own possibilities . She is easily alarmed and often jittery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , she would tell me . When she is n't , she will  --  I visualize that approaching occasion reluctantly more and more frequently  --  and I look ahead grimly to the day or evening she marches into my study to mock me with that . What am I supposed to say ? I will laugh it off , of course , minimize its importance , so as not to send her into promiscuity and perversion on one side or frigidity and abstinence on the other . What a dilemma . " Well , I 'm sure other girls your age do it too , my dear , " I can hear myself saying with suave insouciance , flicking the white ash off a cigar I do not smoke . " I imagine you 're not the first . Do n't they ? " What will I really feel ? ) She lacks confidence in herself and , like my boy ( and me ) , is wary of strangers and ill at ease with people to whom she has just been introduced . ( I , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to pretend I 'm not  --  especially when I am sleeping at home with my wife , although I usually wait until I can no longer keep awake before I go to sleep . Ha , ha . When I sleep away from home with my wife , I will have a nightmare the first orp169second night , usually the same one : a strange man is entering illegally through the door , which I have locked , and drawing near , a burglar , rapist , kidnapper , or assassin ; he seems to be Black but changes ; I think he is carrying a knife ; I try to scream but can make no sound . I have this same bad dream at home often , even though I carefully lock all my doors beforegoing to sleep . I have had it dozens and dozens of times . I have always had it . I must make some sound , though , while I am having the dream and trying in vain to scream , for my wife awakens with the noise of my struggles and rouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did n't know , that I was having a nightmare . Sometimes , even when I am trapped deep in my agony and whatever menaces me is movingright up to my bedside , some different section of me is tuned in omnisciently to the nature of the experience , knows and reassures me it is all just a very bad dream and watches from outside it tranquilly and smugly and waits expectantly , with enjoyment , for my wife to be disturbed by my noises and motions and to call to me by name and shake me awake by the shoulder to tell me I was having a nightmare . I think people have more than one brain . I like the idea of scaring my wife with my nightmares . Sometimes , when she is having a nightmare , I revenge myself on her by not waking her up and allowing it to torture her for as long as it wants to , while I watch her from outside , idly and smugly , leaning on my elbow . I have piss dreams too , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping away from home without my wife , I am often worried I will have this same bad dream , or a different one just as horrifying . Who will wake me ? Will I survive it if no one does ? I do n't have this dream when I 'm alone . Will I be embarrassed and apologetic with whoever wakes me in the next room or same bed ? There are many nights now when I am grabbed wildly by insomnia the instant my head touches the pillow and am then tumbled about violently all night long . My body  --  particularly my legs , shoulders , and elbows  --  is heavy and unmanageable ; I have no place to put them ; my soul is fragile ; my mind is tissue thin and easily pierced byp170emotions and images . I can do nothing at all . My head fills and races with disconnected thoughts . By now , I can identify this tumultuous insomnia in the first second or two ; I no longer try to overcome it . It is useless . I give in to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , submitting , keeping my eyes closed because that 's easier , and depend on morning to come and rescue me or for sleep to steal upon me unawares after several hours and snatch me away from those buffeting cataracts of fantasy , fury , reminiscence , and speculation  --  all of it inconsequential  --  that race through my head in such torrential splashes . Poor me . I 'm not sure I 'm such a good sleeper after all , although I can generally doze off easily after lunch and sexual intercourse . I am surprised when I awake in the morning after a seizure of insomnia to realize I have been asleep ; I am often aghast upon awakening from a sound , dreamless sleep to realize how far away from life I have been , and how defenseless I was while I was there . It is almost as though I truly am afraid of the dark . Like my daughter . And my boy . Like I used to be as a child . And later . I might be unable to return . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad , weird dreams , are my only contact with reality when I sleep ; I want them ; I even welcomeheadaches at night ; I am out of existence . Where am I , then , when I am not ? Filed away ? I worry about things like that lately and did when I was small . All the things I worry about now I worried about more when I was small . I worry about the need for surgery someday for just that reason ; the cutting , hammering , sawing , and stitching are all obnoxious enough ; but the thought of anesthesia that benumbs the mind totally is even more repelling . Where will I be in that bottomless , measureless time between the moment they lower the cone over my nose and mouth and instruct me to breathe deeply , as they did when I was a kid and had my tonsils out , and again when I was married already and had two impacted wisdom teeth pulled , and the moment the first thought stirs in my brain again and I , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am miraculously resurrected ? I think anp171authentic miracle takes place in the universe every time I come awake again after going to sleep . What is happening to me when I am not conscious of myself ? Where do I go ? Where have I been ? Who watches over me when I am gone to make sure I do get back ? If I die under anesthesia , I will certainly be the last one to find out I have departed . I try my wife 's tranquilizers when I feel it might be impossible for me to sleep and think they might help . I do n't want sleeping pills ; they bring to mind visions and aromas of old-fashioned funeralparlors , dentists ' offices , and wax fruit . Years back when my daughter was small , she would materialize in our bedroom in the black hours of night , or in the doorway of the living room if one or the other of us was up late , all at once she would just be there ; and make faint , odd , rustling noises that were barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  until she forced us to look up and take notice of her . She could not speak ; her mouth seemed numb ; she could only reply with a grunting and drowsy incoherence to the sharp questions we fired at her and she did not rememberwhen we questioned her again in the morning about it after we had made her return to her own room . Or claimed she did n't . We tried gropingly to relate these episodes to her tonsillectomy ; but they had started earlier , and there had been no complication over the operation , at the hospital or at home , before or afterward . Just disillusionment . She had expectedsomething different . It soon stopped . And we soon stopped thinking about it , since she seemed to have gotten over it . When my boy 's tonsils were taken out , he did n't want to stay in his own room , either . There were no complications , they told us . But for a little while afterward , he would sneak into our room in the dead of night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our bed . He did not want to be alone . If he came in too soon , when we were still awake , we would make him go back to his own room and tell him he could leave a lamp on ; sometimes we would yell ; but he would alwaysreturn , or try to , no matter how many times we yelled , stealing back into our room over and over again as quietlyp172and slyly as he could , like some yearning creature newly born , and curl up on the floor against the foot of the bed . We would find him there when we awoke , lying on his side like a well-formed fetus , sucking his thumb . It was a chilling , heartsickeningexperience for us to clamber out of sleep each day and receive as our first blow of the new morning the shocking sensation that there was another living being in the room with us . When we closed the lock of our bedroom door to keep him away , he would sleep curled up on the floor just outside . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night , we would strike his body unexpectedly as it lay there when we opened the door and almost scream with fright . If we got out of bed in the darkness , we were afraid we might step on him . We could have let him come into bed with us , of course ; we wanted to . But a doctor told us no . We did n't like to see him that way . We did not want to shut him out . I 'm sorry now we did . I think the doctor was wrong . I do n't know what else we should have done . ) She is very touchy and defensive and will interpret even the mildest suggestions about herself as ferocious personal attacks . She is prone to disparaging herself unfairly , and she takes issue with us intensely when we defend or praise her . She will occasionally start to cry , as though we were doing the belittling . She has a definite gift for placing me in predicaments like that . She is not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin is not as oily as she fears it is , and her face is much , much prettier than she is willing to believe . She is actually quite attractive . But she does n't believe her eyes ; and she cannotbelieve our assurances . She envies all other girls she knows for one quality or another ( this one 's figure , that one 's hair , the next one 's money , the next one 's brains or talents ) and does not know who it is she should want to emulate . ( Now that she is tall for her age , she feels mammoth and clumsy . When she was shorter than most of her friends , she was convinced that only very tall girls were ever considered beautiful . When she was slender , she felt flat and sexless . Now that she is overweightp173a bit and has large developing breasts , she feels ungainly and believes that boys only fall in love with girls who are slim and have straight bellies . ) This might be funny , if it were not so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether she wants her breasts ( tits ) to be larger or smaller . ( This might be funny too , if she did not brood over the matter mournfully for long , silent stretches during which she is very much withdrawn . Sometimes she sits with us and is worlds away . " A penny for your thoughts , " I used to say . Now I get no answer to this gambit , just a look of dis-dain . ) She feels she is not much good at anything ; and she is n't . But who cares ? Who cares if she does not have any special aptitudes , talents , beauty , or social skills ? She cares . ( And perhaps I care . And my wife . And perhaps we have let her know we care . If we said to her that we did not care about things like that , she would say to us that we did not care about her at all . She knows all the tricks . How can I tell my daughter she is the most marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both know she is n't ? What answer can I give when she asks me how she compares to other girls who outshine her in one way or another ? ) She cares a great deal . ( And so , perhaps , do I. ) " Are you very disappointed in me ? " she asks periodically . " No , of course not , " I answer . " Why should I be ? " She knows many people and is lonely , and almost never seems to have a good time . ( This is infuriating to us , her obdurate refusal to be happy and have fun , although we try not to look at it in just that light . But I know I have been so enraged with her at times for having nothing to do that I have wanted to seize her fiercely by the shoulders , my darling little girl , and shake her , pummel her frenziedly on the face and shoulders with the ' sides of both my fists , and scream : " Be happy  --  God dammit ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on it ? " I have never done that , of course , or even mentioned the impulse to my wife , who would be repelled by the brutalp174ugliness of the urge and regard it as abnormal and depraved  --  even though I know she experiences this same brutal and abnormal impulse herself . And about my wife 's own endless nigglings with my daughter , I have commented : " I hope you understand that it 's really your own happinessyou 're thinking about , and not hers . " " That is n't true . " My wife was adamant in objection . " Do n't you think I want her to be happy ? I 'm thinking of her ! " " Balls , " I replied , or wanted to . Because I know it was my wife who sent her into a paroxysm of weeping by suggesting to her , apropos of nothing else we were talking about , that she have a sweet sixteen party ; for it has been an unmentioned secret that she never knows enough boys and girls she likes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose a decent celebration for her , and that this is one of the poignant sources of her unhappiness . ) She thinks of herself as unpopular . She makes friends easily and discards them callously . She is still shy with boys . ( She has already had , I think , at least one bad sex experience of some kind and is looking forward apprehensively to having some more . ) She is not comfortable with boys in the house when I am there . Was my wife as innocent in her proposal as she seemed , or did she make the suggestion with sly , and perhaps unconscious , cruelty ? I do n't know . Probably she was innocent , for my wife tends to look back with nostalgia on what she remembers as the enjoyable occasions of her own girlhood . My wife reveled like a princess in the sweet sixteen party her own mother made for her , or thinks she did . ( Perhaps it was the last time in her life she was allowed to feel important . ) My wife is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some good in everyone ( when I let her ) and to project the rosiest colorations onto past experiences , with the result that her recollections are often inaccurate . She likes to think she loved her mother , but she knows she hated her . Her girlhood was tortured , not happy . She hates her younger sister and always has . ( At least I did n't begin hating my mother until she became a burden to me . I still have sad ,  |p175yearning  dreams about my mother in which I am young and she is going away . And there are tears drying in the corners of my eyes when I open them . ) My daughter does n't really like her friends very much ( she shuffles them in and out of her good graces arbitrarily ) , and neither do I , with the exception of one classmate half a year older who is slim and pretty and secretive and who , I am just about convinced , is flirting with me , leading me on . ( I encourage her . ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . She has a knowing , searching air about her that sets her apart from the others . She keeps her look on me when I am near , and I keep mine on hers . I 'm not sure which one of us started it . I think it was me . ( Perhaps we recognize something , the same thing , in each other , and she thinks that I am flirting with her , which may be true , but if I am , I am only kidding . I hope I 'm only kidding . ) Sixteen would be too young , even for me . ( Or would it ? Someone is going to be laying that provocative , pretty , hot-pantsed little girl soon , if someone is n't doing it already , and why should n't it be me , instead of some callow , arrogant wise guy of eighteen or twenty-one , who would not relish her as much as I would , regale and intoxicate her with the spell of flattery and small attentions I could weave , or savor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be certain to . Although I 'm not so sure I would want to tell anyone about this one . ) No , sixteen is too young ( young enough to be my daughter , ha , ha ) , and I turn irritablewhenever my daughter comes out of her room to chat with us wearing only a nightgown or a robe that she does n't always keep fully closed on top or bottom . ( I do n't know where to look . ) I either walk right out without explanation ( seething with anger but saying nothing ) or command her in a brusque , irascible voice to put a robe on or put her legs together , or keep the robe she does have on closed around the neck and down below her knees if she wants to stay . She is always astounded by my outburst ; her eyes open wide . ( She does not seem to understand why I am behav/ing that way . I can not explain to her ; I ca n't even explain it to my wife . I find it hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what other interpretation is there ? ) Afterwards , I am displeased with myself for reacting so violently . ( But there is little I can say to apologize . Where am I supposedto look when my tall and budding buxom daughter comes in to talk to me wearing almost nothing , sprawls down negligently with her legs apart , her robe open ? How am I supposed to feel ? Nobody ever told me . ) They are all morbidly alike , the girls and boys in this somber social circle of adolescents of which my daughter is a part ( none are happy ) , much more so than the girls and boys and men and women I work with in the company ( although , to them , we might seem all alike ) . None are well-adjusted . ( I am well-adjusted , which is not exactly the best recommendation for adjustment , is it ? ) They manifest defiance , displeasure , lassitude , and indifference . They generally have nothing they want to do . There is nothing they want to be when they grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. There is now no one else I would rather be than me  --  even though I do n't really like me and am not even sure who it is I am . ) They are not comfortable with adults ( me ) ; they pose and attitudinize when they are with us ; they strive to be as reticentand solitary as moles . They do not want us to hear what they say when they talk to each other . I used to believe they were always feigning ; now I believe they really are as cynical and disheartened as they think they are pretending to be . They do n't want to be doctors when they grow up , or aviators , or heavyweight champions of the world . They do n't really want to be lawyers . None of them wants to be President of the United States , Chief of Staff , Chairman of the Board of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. , or me . ( Why should they ? There are enough other people to do that kind of work . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I have nothing else I can do . ) They have good reason to be so pessimistic , I feel ; the pity is they found it out so soon.  |p177Some  of the girls and some of the boys always do seem to be having an easier time of it than the others , but this only lasts a little while for any of them , and even my daughterwill surface buoyantly every now and then and whiz along vivaciously until something happens ( sometimes that something is so elusive that it can not even be identified ; it is almost as though she suddenly runs out of her supply of joy the way a car runs out of gas ) that breaks her moraleand dissolves her confidence , and she sinks back sluggishlyand safely into her accustomed mire of regret . Some of the boys she goes with swagger and boast a good deal more than the others , but the worldly self-assurance they affect is transparently unreal . If not , if they really were as tough and egotistical and domineering and amoral as they wish to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen my daughter with these boys in crowded cars , and I did not like what I saw , or imagined . ( But what difference does that make ? ) What difference does it make , really , what she is or is n't doing already with those boys I could so easily dislike , and even perhaps with girls ( just about all of the young girls I do it with these days brag now about having done it , at least once , with other girls too ) , in those crowded cars she drives in to pizza joints with loud music ( I do n't really like most of their music , although I sometimes pretend to just to please my daughter ) or to parties with the same loud music in other people 's darkened houses -- as long as they do n't drive recklessly and get killed or maimed in an automobile accident ? ( What difference does it make anymore who is screwingwhom ? ) It is already too late for anything else . It is too late , I think , for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know anymore how to try . Something happened to both my children that I can not explain and can not undo . I ca n't be good to them , it seems , even when I want to . " Listen , " I say to both of them anxiously , practically pleading with them to allow me to help them . " What do youp178want to be when you grow up ? Tell me . What do you want to do ? " " I do n't ever want to get married , " my daughter mumblesmoodily , " or ever have children . " " Work in a filling station , " my boy answers . " Well , that 's a bit better . " I approve , nodding with a look of praise . Why not ? Own his own business ? It makes some sense . Profitable franchise : Exxon , Texaco , Sunoco , Shell , Gulf ? Sure . It 's something . A start . Okay . " Why ? " " I like the smell of gasoline . " Christ ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to Green at the office , almost in desperation . " That are older than mine . You 've got a boy in college , have n't you ? What does he want to be when he gets out ? " " A suicide . " " I 'm not joking . " " You think I am ? I 've got a daughter in college too . She has abortions . Between suicide attempts . She lays bums . They do n't want to continue . There 've been three attempts between them . That I know about . One by slashing , two by drugs . It sounds like Paul Revere , does n't it ? They 're both on drugs . My new wife is crazy too . So is her mother . So is mine . It 's not my business anymore . " " I 'm sorry . I did n't know . " " Go do some work . It 's not your business either . " He has written his children off , filed them away , closed them out like dead records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my children , and I wish to engulf them in devotion and safeguard them against every slight . ( I want them to believe I love them . ) " Listen , " I exclaim to them frantically , " you do n't have to do what everybody else does . You can be whatever you want to be . I 'll help . You do n't have to join the Cub Scouts or play baseball or go to Sunday school or even to college . What do you want to do ? " " Join the Cub Scouts and play baseball , " says my boy.  | " Go into my room and play my records now , " says my daughter . Good God  --  has it happened to them already ? They do n't care . Or they do n't know . When did it happen ? Where ? Where was I when the decisions were made that determined he would want to join the Cub Scouts and play baseball now , and all she would want to do is go into her room to talk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really too late ? It is too late , I feel , for me to save her , or even to help her , and I really do n't think I would know what to do anymore to try ( except to sit apathetically and watch her go her unhappy way ) . It would do no more good for me to try to change her now than it has done in the past , when she was more credulous and suggestible and more eager to please . I have tried ; I have taunted , reasoned , thundered , whined , disciplined , flattered , and cajoled , to no avail and perhaps much harm , until I confessed to myself one day that it was not merely hypocritical of me , but futile , and therefore foolish . Then I stopped . ( Now I go through perfunctoryroutines . I acknowledged to myself also that I was not really as exercised as I maintained by her shortcomings and mistakes and by the frameworks for future disasters that I watched her constructing . All that seemed calamitous to me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that endangers me now is her resistance and disrespect . ) What was the purpose in continuing to try to influence her ( other than to be able to say someday  --  now  --  that I tried ) ? I know I have no power over her now . ( If I knew she were about to become a heroin addict and then a common prostitute , I would n't know what to do to avert it . I would rail and curse my fate ; but none of that would help . So I would n't try at all . ) She does n't know yet that I have no power over her ; so I bluff , and for the time being ( redundancy coming ) we have a modus vivendi . ( All I have left is the power to cripple her . ) ' Where was the morality , duty , and good sense in trying to turn her into a kind ofp180person I do not like and one that she was probably never able to become anyway ? I know where it will end ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing it . But what can I do ? Nothing . I know that much too ) . She is already what she is , already well on her way to being what she is destined to become , good and/or bad , and I do n't think there is any longer a single thing I or anyone else can do at present to help her or change her . She is going to become a lonely , nervous , contemporary , female human being . ( She is too smart to be dumb . ) She is much smarter than my wife , which means for one thing ( unlike my wife , so far ) that she will sleep with other women 's husbands ( and that she will not be overly impressed , for long , with her own ) . I ca n't stop that . I can not fight and nullify a whole culture , an environment , an epoch , a past ( especially when it 's my own past and environment as well as hers , and I myself am such a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment to them all so contemptibly . Why should I expect her ( or even want her ) to be different from other girls and women I know and like ? ( Except that they are not happy . ) ( But who is ? ) If she is n't really smoking a pack of cigarettes a day outside the house this year , she will smoke a pack of cigarettes a day outside the house next year . And if she is n't screwing for one or more of the boys she knows now , she 'll be screwing for them later , and doing other commonplacesex stunts with them as well . " That 's some thing to say about your own daughter , " my wife remarks , with a grimace of revulsion . " Even if it 's true ? " " Yes . " ( And yet that is precisely the thing we both would say about her if she were not our own daughter , for my wife and I have engaged in this same derogatory speculation about most of my daughter 's friends and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a matter of morals anymore , or even of decision ; it is only a matter of time . ( And my wife , who hasp181a romantic loyalty to the way things ought to be , ignores her own past . She prefers to forget that even we were doing it all to each other before we were married . ) And what 's the use of making believe it is n't ? I know where my daughter is heading from the girls I know who have already been there . She will not go to church like my wife . ( She goes now every third or fourth Sunday only to placate my wife and place her under an emotional debt for which she will later obtain exorbitant payment . She makes fun of the service while she is there and trades laughing , sidelong glances with my boy , who already finds the whole extraordinary ritual somewhat silly . ) She will drink whiskey for a while instead ; then stop ; then start in again after she 's been married several years and drink whiskey regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two children or three and be divorced ( unlike my wife ) , and she will marry a second time if she and the children are still young when the first marriage breaks up . She will smoke marijuana ( who does n't ? Even Ivy League fraternity boys on the executive level at the company smoke it now , and so do I when it 's proffered at any of the parties I attend in town without my wife ) , if she is n't doing so already ; if she does n't smoke pot and hash at least once in high school , she will smoke it when I send her away to college and everyone interesting she meets there is already smoking it . She will get laid . ( There is just no other way to deal with that fact ; and the best one can wish for her in this area is that she enjoy it wholesomely from the start . Although I find it hard to wish it . And I hope she never decides to confide in me about that . ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free ) , have all-night revels and bull sessions , complain about her teachers and curriculum requirements , have no interest in any of her academic subjects but get passing grades in all with very little work , if she does n't drop out altogether becauseof sheer dejection and torpor ( which she will eulogize into something mystic and exalted , like superior intelligence ) . She will experiment with pep pills ( ups ) , barbitu/rates ( downs ) , mescaline , and LSD , if LSD remains in vogue ; she will have group sex ( at least once ) , homosexual sex ( at least once , and at least once more with a male presentas a spectator and participant ) , be friendly with fags , poets , snobs , nihilists , and megalomaniacs , dress like other girls , have abortions ( at least one , or lie and say she did . Just about every young girl I meet these days has had at least one abortion , or claims she did , and feels compelled to boast about it to me ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she will probably enjoy none of it , and might really not want to do any of it . ( She is a strongmindedgirl who is far too weak to withstand a popular trend . ) If it is n't one type of self-destruction and self-degradationshe cultivates for a while , it is certain to be another ; and she will emerge , if she is lucky , from this period of wanton profligacy and determined self-expression after two-and-one-half to four-and-two-thirds years feeling tense , worthless , spent , and remorseful , having searched everywhereand found nothing , with no ego at all , and pine for just one good , stable , interesting man to marry ( like myself ) and live happily ever after with . She will wish she had children . ( She wo n't find that one man she wants , of course , because we 're not that good . ) I hope she stays away from addictive drugs so that she will be able to come out of it when she decides she wants to . I hope she does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't insist on telling me about any of it . ( I hope she never falls so deeply into some kind of trouble that I have to find out . I hope she does n't get killed in a car crash . ) I know this bumpy terrain too well , and I know she is already bouncing and tumbling through it downhill , with a will and momentum that can not be stayed and which is not really entirely of her own choosing ( no matter what she elects to believe ) . The die is cast ( iacta alea est ) , although I do n't know when her dice were rolled or who did the throwing . ( I know I did n't . ) I know I must have done some horribly damaging things to her when she was little , butp183I ca n't remember what those things were or when I did them . ( I swear I did not want to . There have been times I wanted to hurt , I 'll admit , but never seriously , I swear , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own tangled future , careening bruisingly from one obstruction right into another , and I can no more halt her descent than I could catch a boulder in an avalanche . ( I would be destroyed also if I tried . She is on her way , she is no longer mine . ) She is skidding and falling ahead , resolutelyout of control , into times of arid , incomprehensible turmoil that contain no enticement and offer nothing alluring , except having something else to do and getting free of us . ( " Think positive , please , " I have urged her tartly . " What do you want to be ? What do you want to do ? " If I were presented with those same questions , I would not have a good answer anymore either . A suicide ? Why not ? What 's better ? A filling station ? No . But , what 's the hurry ? If I did not have girls to play around with and such serious problems at home to contend with , I think , sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this fucking job of mine . ) And I tend to feel that she and I have come by now to a point of tacit agreement , our modus vivendi , to the mutual understanding that each of us has already written the other off , that neither of us really belongs to the other any longer , and that we are both merely keeping up appearances , going through perfunctory routines ( as I wrote my mother off a long time before I buried her , and , as I now believe , she did the same with me . She saw through me , I think , dim and old and speechless as she was , and indulged and babied me correctly by letting me indulge and baby her as she wasted away in that nursing home during those final months of awkward visits in which I did nothing more usefulthan bring hor highly seasoned things to eat and sit by her bedside for almost an hour gazing stealthily at my watch and babbling blithe , patent nonsense in which she showed little interest . That was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final moments we were to spend with each other in all eternity . What a chance I had , we had , to say something . Nothing came out . I 'll bet , now , that these inconvenient , unproductive visits were no more pleasant for her than they were for me . I made them because she was my mother ; she endured them , I think , because I was her son . She was always perceptive and would see into me ) , biding our time , my daughter and I , as we go through the formalities of pretending to be still related . She lives here , follows loose procedures , and has dinner with us ; I talk to her , buy her things , and will continue to profess to be interested in her until she is old enough to go away to college or move away somewhere else , as she never ceases stressing she wishes to do . " Someday soon , " she says , " maybe this summer when school is over , I think I would like to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . In the city . Either by myself or with just one friend . And then in the fall , I think I would like to go away to boarding school . I do n't really like any of my friends here . " " I will help you , " I reply noncommittally ( and know instantaneously that it is the wrong thing for me to say . I had not intended this time to be unkind . But the words themselves carry a sting of rejection that makes me smart with compunction ) . " Seriously . I will help you find a decent , safe place , and I 'll give you the money you need to pay for it and live there . " " I mean it . " " So do I. " " You 're making a joke out of it . " " You 'll need my help . You 'll need me to sign the lease . You 're too young . " " I want to live my own life . " " Who 's stopping you ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other in another one of those abrasive battles of wits . ) " It seems to me you can , now that I 've offered to pay the bills and said I 'd let you go . "  |p185I  can outfox my daughter easily just about every time . ( Even when I do n't want to . I ca n't keep my mouth shut . ) I do n't know what else to do when we spar like that and she tries to show me she is as good as I am . ( She is n't . Should I let her win ? ) She hurts me , and I hurt her ; she strikes me , and I strike back . She likes to browbeat my wife and me into spending excessive sums of money on her for things that have not much value to her once she owns them ( it is one method she has found of exercising power over us ) ; I permit her to succeed , without resistance , comment , or complaint ( it 's a method I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run to let these really rather negligible amounts of money go than to keep quarrelingwith her over them in a series of emotional discussionsthat might not be concluded otherwise . I win victories over her , I have found , by giving in to just about everything nettlesome she proposes ) . She thinks I am immature . It galls me to hear her say so ( even when she says it with approval , when I am succeeding in making her laugh , it irks me to hear her tell me that I never fully grew up and that I am , in her opinion , still as playful and childish as a little boy . My boy is frequently distressed and offended when I try to make him and my daughter laugh in public , by singing , walking funny , or making unexpected , loud wisecracksin elevators , drugstores , or supermarkets ) , and I have taken to wondering ( wishing ) bitterly now and then after the most disruptive of these sessions with her , as I sit stewingresentfully in discontent and suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by running far away from home like so many other unhappy girls her age ( I guess I might be sorry if she did . I would n't miss her , I think , since we do n't actually have that much to do with each other anymore , but I would have to go through such elaborate efforts to find her and so many clumsy conversations with other people about her having run away ) and make things easier for me by leaving me in peace . And it is my wife , of all people , who brings me to a halt on thesep186occasions , who makes me stop and reflect when I am feeling most murderous and sour , when I am out of my mind with wrath and aboil with a blazing yen for revenge , my wife who utters the words that shed some light , and even hope , and make me remember what I ought never allow myself to forget . She calls me stupid ; she tells me I am rotten , selfcentered , insane ; that I am " no good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife the words I think my mother tried to say to me in the nursing home the last time she spoke ) . It is my wife , maudlin , discouraged , repetitious , often inane , who , abused by my daughter and oppressive to her in return , berates me with grief and compassion and makes the surprising observation that puts my daughter back into vivid focus suddenly . In tears , crying quietly ( I have no patience anymore with women who cry , and my wife knows it and tries not to ) , it is my wife who remonstrates with me , defending her : " She 's just a little girl . " My daughter is just a little girl , and I try to outfox her in argument . ( I just ca n't help it . ) I talk to her as I would to a grown-up , to Kagle , Green , Jane , or my wife , cleverly , cogently , glibly , bitingly . I react to her unpleasant moods as I would to some insulting adult my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in debate : I want to top her always when we trade taunts and wisecracks , and I usually succeed . ( If I ca n't be funnier , I can always get angrier and grasp my victory that way . ) I am ashamed ; she makes me forget she is only a child . It is very important to me that I beat her in all our contests . When we discuss or dispute anything , I must be the one to deliver the most intelligent opinions . ( I compete with her . ) If my daughter criticizes me or complains about me or makes a disparaging joke ( even a very humorous and lighthearted one ) , I canp187be as affronted , hurt , and unnerved as though some stinging jibe had been inflicted upon me by Green . ( I will hide my feelings from both of them , although I suspect Green sees into my skull and knows everything that takes place there . I may even want to cry . ) I will sulk ( and it is almost as , though my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our roles are reversed ; and it is somewhat eerie . ( I depend on her . I wanted security from her ; I do not get it . Instead , she troubles me with her problems . She takes my time . I do get some of this security from my little boy  --  so far . " Who do you like ? " I can fire at him almost any time with a grin . " I love you , Daddy ! " he will cry with joy , and hurl himself forward to embrace me with an ardor that jars us both . But he is afraid of spiders and bees  --  so am I and of crumblingankle bones , and I sense much trouble ahead for both of us . I have never felt only sadness at the death of a friend or relative or the departure to a faraway place of someone I like , or even perhaps love . Always there has been simultaneouslya marked undercurrent of relief , a release , a secret , unabashed sigh of " Well , at least that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder how I would feel about the death of a child . ) She still has power to wound me ; I have power to wound her ( so maybe we have not really written each other off entirely yet . Maybe that 's why we want to , we are dangerous to each other . My wife ca n't hurt me . My daughtercan ) . I do n't want to hurt her . I do not want her to hurt me . I want her to like me . ( I want Green to like me , and everyone else I meet in the whole world to like me , except the people I 've already met , handled , found inconsequential , and forgot about . ) I want her to obey and admire me ( and will hit back brutally at her when she is rude or disparaging ) . I ca n't bear defiance from any member of my family ( or from waiters or other public servants who are supposed to be subordinate , although I often keep silent with these others and nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and continual kindness .

If my teen-age daughter does something wrong , it is something wrong : it is an insulting , intentional , inexcusable attack against me that requiresswift and severe retribution .

Or is it that she is already in her teens , growing up and away from me , slipping free from my authority , already preparing to live without me , to challenge frontally my wisdom , morality , and ability , and threatening to dislodge me , if she can , from my shaky stronghold of dictatorial self-esteem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rejections from my little boy when he grows up too ?

" " Honey , I  --  " But she is gone , disappearing intransigently with a look of mournful loathing as I put my arms out to comfort her ( and I am left again by myself in my study with my empty hands outstretched in the air , reaching out toward nothing that is there ) . There is something I have done to her ( or am doing to her now ) for which she refuses to forgive me , and I do n't know what that something is ( or even if it is to her I am doing it . I know she acts angry and hurt when I am drunk orp205even a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirt with her friends ) . I try to remember when it began , this mordant , stultifying sorrow into which she sneaks away to bury herself so often . I know it was nothing that happened this year , for she was not much different last year , and it was nothing that happened last year for she was not much different then than the year before . ( She is not much different at fifteen from what she was at twelve and not much different at twelve from what she was at nine . ) Almost as far back as I can recall , in fact , she has always been pretty much the same person she is now , only smaller . And yet , there must have been a break somewhere , an end and a starting point , a critical interval in her development of some breadth and duration that I can not rememberor did not notice ( just as there must certainly have been a similar start of metamorphosis somewhere back in my own past that I took no notice of then and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( indeed she was , I do remember that ) , a playful , chubby , gleeful , curious , active , giggling , responsive baby , easily pleased , quickly interested , and happily diverted . ( Whatever happened to it , that baby she was ? Where did it go ? Where is it now ? And how did it get there ? Such beings , such things , just do n't happen one day and stop happening the next . Do they ? What happened to the lovely little me that once was ? I remember certain things about him well and know he used to be . ) What happened to her early childhood , that unmarked waste between the infant we had then and the daughter we have now and have kept reasonably good track of ? ( Where is it ? Where was it ? When  --  I can remember intact everything in her history , and I do n't know  --  did it take place ? I know this much : there was a cheerful baby girl in a high chair in my house once who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot with spontaneous zest ; she is n't here now ; and there is no trace of her anywhere . And I am sure of this much : there was a little boy who surprised his big brother with a girl in a coal shed once and had a lump of coal thrown at him , and opened a door once on his father and mother embracing in bed , orp206thinks he did ; the mother and father are dead , and the little boy is missing ; I do n't know where he came from ; I do n't know where I went ; I do n't know all that 's happened to me since . I miss him . I 'd love to know where he 's been . ) Where in her lifetime ( and in mine too , of course ) was that legendaryhappy childhood I used to hear so much about ( those carefree days of joy and sunshine , ha , ha , that birthright ) that she is entitled as a human being to be enjoying even right now ( along with all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are her friends ) and should be at liberty to look back upon fearlessly later with intense and enriching gratification ( like my wife , whose childhood was really like some kind of suffocating ashland until I swept into the picture and carried her away from unhappiness into her present life of uninterruptable bliss . Ha , ha ) when life turns old , threadbare ( teeth come out , toes abrade , arches begin to ache and spinal columns too , and shoes no longer fit ) , dry , and sour ? Where is that pleasurable childhood everybody keeps thinking everybody else has ? I know I did n't have one ( although I might have thought I did and could have thought I knew why I did n't in case I thought I did n't ) . If I was unhappy , I could always tell myself it was because my father was dead . If my daughter is unhappy , she might feel it 's becauseher father is alive ! ( Freud or not , I have never been able to figure out how I really did feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even felt either way about her at all . I think I felt nothing . I had the same feeling , or absence of feeling most of the time , toward the other members of my family and my best friend , with whom I am not on very friendly terms anymore . We grew tired of each other , and I am relieved . He needed money ; I could n't give it generously more than once . I have never been sure I ever really cared for anyone in this whole world but myself and my little boy . But I still do have these grieffilleddreams about my mother . There 's a part of me I ca n't find that is connected to her still as though by an invisible live wire transmitting throbs . It refuses to die with her , andp207will continue to live inside me , probably , for as long as I survive . In my final coma , I suppose , even if I live to be a million , my self-control will lapse and I will die moaning : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the way I began . I feel lucky sometimes that I do n't remember my father , that he died without making an impression upon me , or I might be having dreams about him , too . In case I ai n't having them already . He might have fucked up my life even more just by being around if he had lived , just the way I seem to be fucking up everyone else 's around me . Even , though I do n't want to . I swear to Christ I never consciously wanted to . Maybe I am having bad dreams about him anyway and just do n't know it . Soon after I die , nobody will ever think about him again . And soon after my children die , nobody will ever think of me . ) I had no happy childhood , if I recall correctly , and neither did my wife ( who prefers to recollect incorrectly , when I let her ) , and my boy , at nine , though he laughs a lot and is intent on making many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though I do everything I can to try to make things easier for him . ( With my daughter , I 've stopped trying . There does not seem to be any way left to propitiate her , except to allow her to continue forcing us to buy expensive things for her and yield her those minute , transitory victories of ego that evaporate in an instant and dump her right back down where she was , in that same vacant , unlighted predicament of not knowing what to do next , no different than before . It is easier for me to spend the eight or eighty dollars on her than to argue with her why I should n't . ) I forage through experience to try to discover when my daughter was different from now , and I must go very far back indeed to find her radiant in a high chair ( she was a gorgeous , lovable child , and I feel a wistful pang of love and regret when I remember ) at a birthday party in her honor , when she was either two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between a baby and the person it becomes . ) She is our only child . Relatives from both sides of the family are present . My wife and I are younger . My mother is alive.  |p208Many  people have assembled . The apartment bustles . Our attention is dispersed . We are absorbed in each other , and my little girl is forgotten until she suddenly strikes the tableboard of the high chair sharply with the plastic pink party spoon clutched in her dimpled fist and calls out clearly and gloriously : " Good girl , grandma ! " It takes a moment for us all to comprehend . And when we do , all simultaneously it seems , we roar with laughter and begin applauding and congratulating this little girl and ourselvesexuberantly ( and my daughter , seeing this response of raucous gaiety she has stimulated , bounces and rocks with glee so vigorously in her high chair that we fear she will fall out or topple over ) , for my mother ( her hair was not all white yet , her face not all desiccated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drained it of some strawberry punch . But my daughter was watching her . And when my daughter , who was herself being trained then by my wife and me to drink from a glass and faithfully rewarded with handclaps of delight and cries of " Good girl ! " whenever she succeeded , saw my mother drink from a glass , she banged her own hands down with delight and approval and called out : " Good girl , grandma ! " ( Not long afterward , my mother could not drink from a glass unless someone held it to her lips . ) It was a small thing , an incident of tiny surprise , but it filled the room with rolling waves of tremendous pleasure and warmth . ( All of us there were happier people then and closer to each other than we have ever been since . ) All of us rejoicedand united in merry praise of my daughter and made the sunniest predictions , and my daughter was so exhilarated by the sheer volume and intensity of such good feeling and elation that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three more times ( no longer spontaneously , but with discerning calculation ) and bounced and rocked on her throne of a high chair , giggling her hearty laugh , luxuriating in her triumph and in the looks and words of adoration directedp209toward her . ( She knew . I was proud of her then , I remember . So pleased with what she had said . So devoted and protective . ) All of us marveled breathlessly at her cheerful wit and beauty ( she was our miracle ) and foresaw sparkling attainments . And even my mother , who tended to be cynical toward everything superstitious , was convinced , she declared , that my daughter had been born under an exceedingly lucky star and would enjoy a brilliant , happy , unblemished future . My daughter really was a darling child , and everybody loved her then , even me . That was just about the last time I saw my daughter so happy . That was just about the last time I saw my mother happy . It was shortly afterward that I made my decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant she would have to live the rest of her life alone . Words were not necessary . The omission itself was an indelible statement . ( She never asked , never made me say so . She made it easy for me . She was very kind to me about that . ) Although I would have dinner with her every other week , at her apartment or ours , and on appropriate family holidays . ( I would even drive her home . None of us wanted her , not my wife , not my daughter , not my sister , not me . ) Not much after that , she suffered the first in her series of crippling brain spasms that robbed her at the outset of her ability to speak and at the end of her ability to think or remember . ( As my mother faded away , speechless , in one direction , Derek emerged , speechless , from the other . ) And there you have my tragic chronicle of the continuity of human experience , of this great chain of being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of Slocums gets and gives to another , at least in my day . ( I got little . I gave back less . ) I have this unfading picture in my mind ( this candid snapshot , ha , ha ) , and it can never be altered ( as I have a similar distinct picture of my hand on Virginia 's full , loosely bound breast for the first time or the amazinglyp210silken feel of the tissuey things between her legs the first time she let me touch her there ) , of this festive , family birthday celebration in honor of my little girl at which my old mother and my infant daughter are joyful together for perhaps the very last time . And there am I between them , sturdy , youthful , prospering , virile ( fossilized and immobilized between them as though between bookends , without knowing how I got there , without knowing how I will ever get out ) , saddled already with the grinding responsibility of making them , and others , happy , when it has been all I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight enough to look existence squarely in the eye without making guileful wisecracks about it or sobbing out loud for help . Who put me here ? How will I ever get out ? Will I ever be somebody lucky ? What decided to sort me into precisely this slot ? ( What the fuck makes anyone think I am in control , that I can be any different from what I am ? I ca n't even control my reveries . Virginia 's tit is as meaningfulto me now as my mother 's whole life and death . Both of them are dead . The rest of us are on the way . I can almost hear my wife , or my second wife , if I ever have one , or somebody else , saying : " Wo n't you wheel Mr. Slocum out of the shade into the sunlight now ? I think he looks a little cold . " A vacuum cleaner that works well is more important to me than the atom bomb , and it makes not the slightest difference to anyone I know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the moon around the earth , although the measured ebb and flow of the tides may be of some interest to mariners and clam diggers , but who cares about them ? Green is more important to me than God . So , for that matter , is Kagle and the man who handles my dry cleaning , and a transistor radio that is playing too loud is a larger catastrophe to me than the next Mexican earthquake . " Someday "  --  it must have crossed my mother 's mind at least once , after my denial and rejection of her , since she was only human  --  " this will happen to you . " Although she was too generous to me ever to say so . But I know it must have crossed her mind. )  | " When I was a baby , " my daughter asks , " did you ever play with me ? " " Sure , " I reply .

" " You 're a big girl now . I always yell out hello when I come home , do n't I ? You do n't even answer . " " Did I have parties when I was little ? Birthday parties ? " " You sure did .

You always change . Sometimes you laugh at something I do . Sometimes you get angry and annoyed when I do exactly the same thing and want me to go away . I do n't like it when you drink . I never know what to expect . " " You 're like that too . " " You 're a father . " " It is n't easy . " " You do n't know how to be a father . "  | " I try to be . I always tried my best .

" I even played baseballwith you with a plastic bat and ball when you were a little girl and did n't know it was a boy 's game , and taught you how to swim . I 'm the one who taught you . I asked you to put your face down in the water and float and promised that nothing bad would happen to you if you trusted me and did . You believedme then and were n't afraid . And that 's how I taught you .

You used to love to do that . Maybe because I had a lot more hair then , ha , ha . You were just a tiny little girl then and could n't even stand or walk . I would kiss Mommy on the cheek when I walked in and go right in to see you every day as soon as I came home . I would bend my head down and you would grab my hair with both your little hands and pull , and you would laugh and bounce and scream and kick your legs with such wild excitement that we were always afraid you were going to bounce right off the bed or kick your way right out of the crib . Ha , ha . You would giggle like crazy . And Mommy would watch and laugh too . We used to do that every day as soon as I got home from work .

You insisted . It was your right , ha , ha , to have a story from me . Every night , and it usually had to be the same story . You did n't like new ones . First it was Cinderella and then it was Peter Pan too after you saw Peter Pan on television . I used to have to act Peter Pan out for you . You would make me . I betp213I nearly broke my legs every night jumping from the couch to the floor when I pretended to fly for you . Ha , ha . Then there was Peter and the Wolf , and Siegfried  --  I once read you the whole story of Siegfried , and you were so soft-hearted then that you even began to cry in sympathy for that dumb blockheadSiegfried , so I never read it to you again  --  and that one about the rabbit and the tar baby , and for a while I tried telling you The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy got eaten up at the end , I think , so we went back to Peter Pan and Cinderella . And in Cinderella , whenever I came to the part where the prince asks Cinderella to marry him , you would interrupt and answer : Sure , prince ! ' Do n't you remember ? Mommy does . Sure , prince ! ' you would cry , ha , ha , and we would both laugh . And Mommy would stand in the doorway and listen , and she would laugh too . When I was out of town , I would try to get to a telephone in the evening before you went to sleep and tell you the story long distance . And I had to tell you the stories in exactly the same way every time . You would make me , ha , ha . If I chanted a line or ever tried to leave something out just to speed things up , you would correct me right away very severely and make me do it exactly the way you wanted me to . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little princess . Ha , ha . You knew all the stories by heart , and you did n't want me to change a word . Every night . Ha , ha . Do n't you remember ? " But she does n't believe me . And I do n't care.  |p217My  little boy is having a difficult time of it in school this year , in gym , in math , and in classes stressing public speaking . And just about everywhere else , it seems . ( At home with me . With my wife . My daughter . My boy seems to be having a difficult time of it in school every year now when the new term starts , but each year seems to grow worse . He is , I 'm afraid , starting to " let me down . " ) He hates gym and public speaking . He used to like gym . ( He never liked public speaking . ) Now he dreads gym , with its incessant regimen of exercises that he can not perform well : chinning , push-ups , rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chinning , and push-ups and is stricken almost speechless ( you can almost see , that bulbous , leaden lump jamming his throat ) by his reluctance even to talk about them ( as though merely to mention his hatred of these ridiculousgymnastic demonstrations would be to violate some clandestine taboo surrounding them and to be sentenced to perform them awkwardly and feebly , with everyone watching , still one more time ) . My boy hates Forgione , the squat , barrelchested , simian gym teacher with forests of black , wiry hair curling out all over him everywhere , even through the weave of his white T-shirt , except on his head , who can break me in two with his bare hands if he ever decided he wanted to , and who tries to be helpful and encouraging to my frightenedp218little boy in his blunt , domineering , primitive way and only succeeds in frightening him further . " He does n't have a good competitive spirit , " Forgione asserts to me complainingly . " He lacks a true will to win . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to him tamely , in an effort to get on his good side . " Maybe he gets it from me . " " That ca n't be true , Mr. Slocum , " Forgione says . " Everybody'sgot a competitive spirit . " " Then why does n't he ? " " That 's what I mean , " says Forgione . My boy can turn frozen and look mucous green with trepidation some mornings when he knows he will have to go to gym later that day , or deliver some kind of oral report in one of his classes , and he will disclose to us that he does n't feel well and thinks he might want to vomit . His chest feels empty , he says , and sometimes his arms and legs feel drained of all substance as well ( if I understand correctly what he is trying to say . He feels he might fall if he tries to stand , simply sag and fold inward and sink to the floor like someone deflatedand without skeleton ) . He does not like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good training for him , " the school says . I know from my own small experience at addressing groups that it is no training at all . ) Sometimes , he has hinted , he will not do as well as he is able to on written reports in order to escape being called upon to read what he has written aloud from the front of the classroomas an example to others of what is superior . ( He lacks the true will to win . ) He never likes to be called upon in class unless he is positive he has the right answer . ( He almost never , his teachers tell us , raises his hand to volunteer a reply . ) He is a gifted , hard-working student ; he is inhibited ; he is a quick , intuitive learner . He is afraid to be wrong . He always seems to know much more about everything than he is disposed to reveal . ( He thinks a lot . I ca n't always make him out . ) He fathoms privately , his clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to . Sometimes when I ask him what he looks so worried about , he glances up at me with a flicker of astonishment and replies that he is n't worrying . I do n't know if he is lying to me or not . I worry a lot that he may be worrying . ) It is impossible for us to tell anymore whether he likes school or not ( he used to like school . Or seemed to ) although he generally manages to adapt to the different people and procedures of each new school year and then begins enjoying himself immensely . It takes a while ; and he girds himself for the effort . He is distant with people he does n't like ; he grows close swiftly with schoolmates he does . ( He is guileful enough by instinct , it seems , to get on friendly and respectful terms with tough guys and bullies . ) He makes many friends . ( He has started to keep things from me , and I do n't like it . I ask questions . I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to them . I do n't want him to . I want him to confide in me . ) Once he does make friends in school and sees himself adapting capably to whatever new systems of authority and social codes prevail , everything tends ( or has tended till now . Knock wood . Ha , ha ) sooner or later to turn out fine : he does well ; he survives ; and he celebrates the miracle of his survival with boisterous , optimistic horseplay and industry unless something , even one thing of some meaning to him , goes wrong for him drastically ( this year so far it is gym and Forgione , with those push-ups , tumbling , and chinning , and that vertical rope climbing to the high ceiling of the gymnasiumwith its theoretical danger of growing scared and dizzy and falling , or freezing in panic halfway up , or down , although nobody I 've ever heard of has . Some kids his age , he tells me , can already go almost halfway up without using their feet . Like monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  he ca n't get more than a single hoist above the resting knot at the bottom of the thick , bristling rope  --  but I wo n't ever want to climb ropes again , and he does . And public speaking . This year , the school has decided to emphasize public speaking
