txt A critical analysis of the public-school system by School Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola drew praise yesterday from Mayor Koch and protest from Albert Shanker , the president of the United Federation of Teachers . " He is doing a super job ? exactly what I hoped he would do , " the Mayor said . Mr. Shanker said that the last thing teachers needed was another attack and that the entire report contained " not one positive , supportive word for our teachers . " The Chancellor 's appraisal Wednesday , requested by the Board of Education at the end of his first six months in office , criticized teachers , administrators , contractors and middle-level managers as often being more concerned with serving themselves than with serving the city 's children . ' Have a Job to Do ' The 24-page report brought reaction from throughout the educational community . Several parents said they were stunned to hear their own opinions coming from the school system 's chief executive officer . The Chancellor agreed that it was unconventional for a bureaucrat to " set forth what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to do , " he said . " Right on , Frank , " Mayor Koch said at a news conference . " He is doing terrific . He is criticizing the principals and the teachers . I 've been doing that for years . " The Mayor , who admits he applied pressure on Board of Education members to appoint Mr. Macchiarola to the Chancellor 's post last July , said he " worries about officials being co-opted by the tern or institution they are heading . " " You know , normally you come in and there are the teachers and the principals and there are all the people you have to sit down over a table with and you start finding excuses for failures . Macchiarola did n't do that , " the Mayor said . Shfirtkpr Vnicen Cortcprn Mr. Shanker was less effusive . In a " Dear Frank , " letter sent yesterday to the Chancellor , Mr. Shanker , who had reconciled his differences with Mr. Macchiarola during the last six months , said he was disturbed that the Chancellor believed teachers had less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . " It 's hard to remain committed with increases in class size , disturbed children who have no guidance or clinical services to turn to , salary freezes , threats of layoffs , " he said . " It 's hard to remain committed in the face of constant undeserved criticism and abuse by editorial writers , community groups , school boards and administrators . Or when orders unilaterally changing the rules of the game on teacher transfers and salary differentials are bureaucratically handed down without prior consideration of how they will affect the teacher in the classroom . " The Chancellor , who has worked hard to garner Mr. Shanker 's support for his programs and is now on his side in fighting the Mayor 's rejection of the teachers contract , was concerned enough about Mr. Shanker 's reaction to call him yesterday morning to say he had not singled out teachers for specific criticism . In his report , Mr. Macchiarola said that the school system in general had " not only tolerated mediocrity , we have developed , congratulated and promoted it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being failed by the system ; too many of those who should be serving our children are only serving themselves . " But the report also dealt specifically with the city 's teachers , and Mr. Shanker noted that the Chancellor had " complained that there is too much ' reliance upon the union contract as the standard of professional responibility . ' " " There is a disturbing tone here , " Mr. Shanker wrote . " You seem to agree with some of the more demagogic critics of our schools in saying that because teachers , like all other Americans , seek to improve their salary , work/rig conditions and lob sectinty. this shows less ccnimitment to the children and to the profession . There is no evfflem e for this . ? we charge th , it doctors or lawyers $100101 a er nitre rte ' , by virtue of their iiiph ? impen.ation. not concerned with pat ICTlic or c ! ienis ? F. the fact that your salary is higher than that of any other Chancellor in the past or any other administrative head of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in ' children ? Of course not . " Mr. Macchiarola earns $59,000 a year . In his report Mr. Macchiarola noted that the Board of Education was cooperating with the teachers union in the development of teacher centers , where teachers may go to work out classrom problems . The Chancellor called the program " most urgent . " But Mr. Shanker said the Chancellor was not as committed to the program as he appeared to be . Mr. Shanker cited a recent directive to the city 's teachers from the Chancellor that ended the practice of city teachers taking fraudulent college courses for credit and higher salaries . " You rightfully say that fraudulent correspondence courses should be eliminated , but , in fact , you have done much more than that . " Mr. Shanker said that the Chancellor had set up such stringent requirements for teacher courses that the very teacher centers Mr. Macchiarola was encouraging could not be attended by teachers who wanted to earn credits toward a higher salary . The Chancellor 's report reviewed many of the changes Mr. Macchiarola had instituted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remained undone .
