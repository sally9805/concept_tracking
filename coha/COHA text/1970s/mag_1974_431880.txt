 | Wisconsin 's Menominees : Indians on a Seesaw THE LATE-AUGUST SUN peered between darkening thunderclouds above the great green Wisconsin woods . My husband , Steve , and I heard the muted morning sounds and felt the wet earth beneath our boots . We sensed it in our bones ? today , we were certain , would be the day . For the fourth misty morning in a row we waded into the woods with our Indian friends Sanome Sanapaw , his son , Joey , and Dude Valliere , to trap the black bear . Sanome , stout and barrel-chested , set the pace as he lumbered through the ancient unaxed forest . Like his father before him , the 59-year-old Menominee had taught his sons all they needed to know about setting bear traps , tracing deer tracks , and hauling in a sturgeon bigger than a man . @#  | August , we learned , was early for bear trapping . Winter-born cubs , only half-grown , were not yet meaty . But it was a lean summer on the wild Wolf River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menominees . Inflation hurt too , in this land of hard work and low incomes . And for the big Sanapaw family , - ummer supplies had run low . As we hiked through pine and hemlock toward the traps , we nibbled on wild blackberries , plump as grapes , growing in the lush forest clearings , and wondered whether Mercilene Sanapaw 's offering to Manitou , the ; reat Spirit , had been accepted . In the tradition of her **29;1263;TOOLONG , Menominee Chief Ah-Kenepoway , Mercilene ? Sanome 's wife ? had ceremoniously made tobacco offering near one of the traps the eight before . I followed the men through the waist-high ferns at a distance , because I sensed it went against tradition for a woman to join in the hunt . Almost before I knew it , they had reached a trap site , and from the whooping and hollering , I knew they had bagged a bear . The Sanapaws , their relatives , and friends Fur-bearing urchins grin mischievously on the front stoop of their Keshena home , holding pelts of raccoons trapped by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Souvenir sales provided extra cash for a dour-faced Menominee and his wife ( right ) , standing by their bark hut in a 1908 photograph . Menominees once controlled nine and a half million acres in Michigan and Wisconsin . An 1854 treaty left them only a small fragment of their original homeland ( below ) . would eat well tonight . One swift shot from Joey 's rifle and the animal was dead . As Joey hoisted the 75-pound carcass over his shoulder , I saw pride in his eyes . But I was sad , knowing that , like the bear , the Menominees were caught in a trap . " Freedom " Takes Its Toll Lured by the promise of independence , the Menominees had surrendered their official status as Indians , and since 1961 had been struggling to survive without the economic support of the Federal Government . Now , deep in poverty , their culture eroding , they were fighting for a return to their old status . Neither they nor I realized last August that victory was only months away . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer was not the white man 's broken promises or forgotten treaties but the immediate practical one of getting food . The bear had solved the problem for that day ? our last with them ? and as the men readied it for dinner , I wandered off alone to gather blackberries for dessert . As I plucked the ripe berries , I thought of @#  | our Menominee friends -- the teachers , the sturdy millworkers , the quiet-eyed children with their ever-present ponies , the tribal elder too blind to weave any more sugarscented sweet-grass baskets . They taught us the Indian way of life ? and showed us they could not , would not , be absorbed into a white culture . Above all , the Menominees taught us that Indian land goes hand in hand with Indian culture , that it stands for the tribe , their tradition , their fundamental Indian rights , and that it can not be shaved away without endangering their survival , Within an hour I 'd picked enough berries for two tartly luscious pies and a batch of fresh jam to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I began the long hike back toward the Sanapaw home . Oshkosh Treaty Shrank Domain It had been a wet , chilly spring day when we first met the Sanapaws . Mercilene , Sanome , and their son Jerry were taking an elementary school class on a field trip . It was May , a time for gathering herbs and wading in the icy Wolf River .  | @# . Rambling along in a battered school bus , we came to Keshena Falls on the Wolf , where in 1854 Chiefs Oshkosh and Keshena had a fateful meeting with federal Indian agents . There , in the last of several major treaties that had already whittled away most of their aboriginal homeland ? nine and a half million acres of dense forest stretching from Lake Michigan to central Wisconsin ( map , page 231 ) ? the Menominees agreed to retain only 275,000 acres . One final cession , in 1856 , reduced the reservation by another 40,000 acres . As part of the settlement for their oncevast domain , which the Menominees called Weesechosek , " A Good Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised eternal government protection . In 1954 Congress voted to withdraw that eternal protection and support , and in 1961 the vote became reality . The Menominees , then numbering 3,270 , became partners in a dubious federal experiment in Indian self-government . They , together with several smaller tribes in the South and West , were officially " terminated " ? reservation lands were turned over to the tribe to run without federal help  | @# or interference . Land that had been exempt from taxation became taxable ; the Bureau of Indian Affairs discontinued all services . Today the Menominees insist ? and BIA officials agree ? that the tribe never freely consented to termination . The consent vote , in which only 5 percent of the tribe took part , was tied to an **31;1294;TOOLONG claim against the Federal Government for mismanagement of their forest and mill . In short , Menominees believed they had to accept termination to receive their money . Upon termination , the Menominee Reservation became the only Indian-run county east of the Mississippi . It remains ? at least for the moment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love for the Land Made the Difference The Menominees faced a new and frightening way of life , involved with stocks , bonds , and corporate business deals . Because officials of the BIA had always handled the tribe 's finances , few Menominees were equipped to take on the job of running their community . The tribal council was dissolved and replaced with a board of directors . Each Menominee became a stockholder in a corporation formed to manage tribal assets . The Menominees were no longer Indians in the eyes of the government . In one respect at least , the Menominees looked after themselves prudently . Though financial headaches forced the other terminated tribes to sell virtually all their lands , the Menominees held fast to their territory . They knew the one thing that kept the tribe together was the land , and they meant to hang Wisconsin 's Menominees : Indians on a Seesaw onto it . Last December Congress finally made their tiny county a reservation again . It is a land full of meaning and mysteries . On that May bus ride with Mercilene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graders and we gathered round a worn brown rock surrounded by a log fence . Mercilene spoke softly . " This rock , Spirit Rock , " she began , " once stood six feet high . For years the Menominee people have come here to offer their tobacco to the spirits in hopes that they would look upon our tribe with kindness . The legend says that when the rock disintegrates , it will mark the end of the Menominee people . " Although the rock , a poor-quality granite , probably will crumble before long , I doubt that the spirit of the Menominees will die . Jerry Sanapaw offered to take Steve and me to a sacred Menominee burial ground while the schoolchildren ran off to gather roots and herbs . We rode in his beat-up beige jalopy , traveling along a narrow , treecanopied highway . Jerry 's car slowed as it approached the old sawmill town of Neopit , one of only three communities in Menominee County . Children romped with a yapping mongrel along the road . We were through in a few minutes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of Neopit 's sawmill hands . Jerry felt it did not reflect true Menominee character . " We have always been a peaceful people . We have seldom been involved in wars with other tribes , because we always believed you could talk things out . " Jerry went on to explain that the Sanapaws , like their ancestors , are leisurely  | people . The land knows no eight-hour day or five-day week . Harvest and hunting become social times . Life is lived day by day , and each moment cherished for its own . " We 're a content people , content with our Indian ways , with the woods , with being close to nature , " Jerry said . Yet I sensed that uneasiness lurked behind his words . At 26 he does not seem content . Jerry fought in Viet Nam , like dozens of other young Menominees . Unlike many of his friends , though , he is a high-school graduate and has tried college studies . Jerry is different in another way , too . Of the county 's 2,600 inhabitants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 . Many young people leave tribal lands for the promise of more opportunity in Milwaukee , Chicago , or Minneapolis . And why not ? The tribe 's one source of employment is a 66-year-old , financially pinched lumber mill ? one of the largest sawmill operations in the Midwest States . The outdated , steam-powered mill employs about 200 Menominees , and is the county 's chief economic asset . Though profits are up , the tribal corporation , Menominee Enterprises , Inc. , has borne a heavy tax burden , which gobbled up meager earnings during the period of termination . Instead of looking for work in the mill , Jerry helps an older brother with his private tree-trimming firm in a neighboring community . Old Burial Rites Live on Jerry , dark-eyed and muscular , wants to remain with his people . But he is superstitious about being too successful among them . " You know , my brother LeRoy , he died a year ago , " Jerry recalled . " His bad luck came , I know , because he was better than the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons , recognition all over . When you 're a Menominee you ca n't stand out , you ca n't be better off than your brothers . " We arrived at the small burial plot , its grass thick with wood ticks . Instead of gravestone markers , I saw long , low wooden huts covering the graves . I learned later of other burial grounds scattered in the high grass off the back roads . " When an Indian dies , " Jerry told me , " one of the family builds the hut . Then the body is carried out through the west window of the family home . The drums beat all night long as the family gathers to tell of all the good things the dead person did while alive . You  | know the spirits are listening and that the person is on the way to heaven , the place we Indians call the happy hunting ground. ? In this land of the Menominees , where 90 percent of the tribe is nominally Catholic , Jerry 's story seemed incredible . People had Id me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny brush were proof bat it had not died . For four days after a death , " Jerry continued , pointing to an opening in the hut , " thefamily brings offerings and puts them through window , so the dead person does n't get hungry on the journey . " At dusk , we returned to the Sanapaw home along the Wolf . Children played around the battered homestead . Some teased a caged pet coyote while others took turns riding the family pony . Inside , Sanome prepared his specialties , fry bread and boiled Indian coffee . " Survival , that 's how we live , " Sanome said . " It 's been tough , very tough , since termination . When the Menominees were terminated , we had to buy our family land . Like others in the tribe we owned the home we built , but the land .... " He was silent . " The land " ? quietly now ? " the land belonged to everyone in common . This is the Indian way . " After termination the Sanapaws had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property from the newly established tribal corporation at about $300 an acre , and then pay taxes on it . But Sanome said , " We just ca n't afford it . " A World War II veteran , Sanome supports his family with a pension plus earnings from a tourist-concession stand he runs . " Over the years , I 've worked about every job around , " he told me . It was n't hard to see in Sanome 's ruddy face a strong millworker , a pulp-cutting woodsman , or a tough highwayconstruction laborer . One of the nine Sanapaw children still lives at home , as do about a dozen of 35 grandchildren and some assorted relatives . Their wood-frame home , like half the homes in the county , has electricity , but the family must haul water from a hand-dug well nearby . Sleeping and eating space is at a premium . Family Clings to Wild-Rice Tradition We sat down to dinner with about twenty members of the Sanapaw family . Because there were guests , Mercilene served up hearty portions of venison and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease , and fry bread . " We harvested this rice last fall on the Wolf , " Jerry said , waving toward a handfashioned rice boat in the backyard .  | The Sanapaws are one of the few Menominee families still wild-ricing . Only a scattering of rice beds remains along the west branch of the Wolf . ( Menominee means " people of the wild rice " in the old Algonquian tongue . ) In the past the Menominees believed that the Great Spirit had granted the tribe two foods to be their own forever ? wild rice and maple sugar . But the Sanapaws are the only family still tapping sugar maples in the spring . Over dinner , Mercilene talked of how she and Sanome tried to hand down the precious remnants of Menominee heritage to their youngsters . " You know , it 's ironic , " Mercilene said , looking much younger than her 61 years . " When I was five , I was sent off to a boarding school run by the BIA , not knowing a word of English , just Menominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night girls would huddle together and repeat the legends we knew , in Menominee , and when the teachers found us , they 'd punish us . " She laughed , but the humor never reached her voice . " Well , today I 'm paid to teach Menominee traditions in the schools , to teach beadwork , and to take children on field trips , as we did today . " Secret of Tribal Medicine : Believe The colorful assortment of roots , herbs , leaves , and tree barks bundled in a corner of the kitchen spoke for the success of the day 's harvest . There was crinkleroot , which could be preserved and used like horseradish to flavor meats and vegetables ; blackberry root , to be made into a tea to treat diarrhea ; and catnip , for babies ' colic . According to Mercilene , these remedies have no medicinal effect unless the user believes in their powers . In days gone by , herb doctors , or medicine men , learned from the Great Spirit the specific qualities of each plant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients . Talk of the Great Spirit filled my mind a we left the Sanapaws that night . The forest seemed alive with legends , warriors in moccasins , medicine men praying over the campfires . But like the Menominees themselves . I could not forget the bitter realities of high taxes , poor health , and soaring unemployment that ate at the soul of this community What reassured me was that unlike many Indian tribes that have few natural resources . the Menominees have their woods . Ninety percent of their land is forest ? pine , hemlock. maple , birch , and oak . " The trees are thick as hair on a dog 's back , " Menominee Enterprises forester Jim Heinz told us . " The tribe works the woods on a sustained-yield setup . cutting only the mature timber . " In his office overlooking the mill , Heinz mapped out a 15-year cutting plan with all the flash of a Pentagon general . " As long as we manage the woods intelligently , " Heinz said , " the Menominees will have enough timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet , ironically , it was the Menominees ' success as woodsmen that led to most of their present-day problems . The Menominees were terminated because , by Indian standards , they were financially well off . Before 1961 the Menominee lumber-mill profits paid the  | government for most of the services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs ? a hospital , schools , highways , and power plant . During most years federal aid to the Menominees was the lowest of any tribe in the nation . Bank Balance Tumbled After Termination But with self-government , the Menominees ' fortunes plunged . By 1972 the tribe 's bank account had sunk from some $10,000,000 to $59,000 . Where did it all go ? Shortly after the termination act was passed in 1954 , the Menominees elected to distribute nearly 3,270 members of the tribe . That money was part of an $8,500,000 judgment granted the Menominees in 1951 for government mismanagement of their forest land . Legal fees took $900,000 of the award . In 1955 more than S2,260,000 was distributed in $750 payments when the Bureau of Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning to the tribe 's general account certain funds that should have gone to individual Menominees for timber cut . The $1,840,000 left in the account was eaten up by the financial burdens of getting  | a new county on its feet . Standards that had been good enough for a BIA sawmill were not good enough for the State of Wisconsin . The tribe had to spend $1,500,000 upgrading the old mill . Much of the rest went to revamp the tribe 's electrical-power plant . Worst of all , there was the new tax burden . Although the mill was clearing more than $500,000 most years , the bulk of it was used to pay property taxes on the tribe 's forest land . Left without expansion capital , the Menominees were unable to increase mill profits or to diversify their business . The Menominees were broke , but they  | refused to give up . Ada Deer made sure they did n't . A tough , aggressive , determined , and optimistic woman ( page 242 ) , this 37-year-old Menominee social worker and community organizer led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of Menominees to go from log cabin to college classroom to the " white man 's world , " Ada acts as the tribe 's lobbyist , carrying the message of the Menominees not only to government officials but also to the nation on whirlwind speaking tours . Officially , she is the elected chairwoman of the Menominee stockholders . Victory at Last for a Modern Warrior Beginning in June 1972 Ada camped out in Washington , D. C. , determined to convince members of Congress that they should reverse the 1954 termination decision . By December 1973 she had won the battle . Under the congressional bill formulated by the Menominees and lawmakers , the services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs are being restored to the Menominees as the land ? their precious link with the past and their hope for the future ? returns to federal-trust status . Tribal land @# will again be tax-exempt , but the tribe will continue to control its government , mill , and forest . Those Menominees who paid for their acreage may give it back to the tribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their lives and land , but it forced them to sell their property to make ends meet . Even the land-proud Menominees had to yield to a degree . To add much-needed tax dollars to the county treasury , the Menominees sold 5,000 acres of lakefront property to whites in search of a summer playground . Today those white landowners live in a separate world . Ada and I drove past a summer-home development , with its manmade swimming beaches and electric hookups for camper trailers . " Selling this land was like selling your furniture to make house payments , " Ada said . " Or like burning down your house to keep warm in a blizzard . " In the end tribal leaders realized that land sales would only prolong their financial woes . The economic situation continued to worsen , until nearly half the tribe was collecting welfare and 40 percent of the families had incomes below the federal poverty level .  | I asked Ada why the Menominees they must again seek aid from the Bureau Indian Affairs ? the often-criticized government agency that since 1834 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because there is no alternative , no other way to hold on to our land . " A former official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs seconded Ada 's view : " The only thing worse than being an Indian under BIA control is being an Indian not under BIA control " The Menominees think restoration can work , and the congressionally authorized Menominee Restoration Committee is now working out the details . And the Menominees had President Nixon behind them . Signing the restoration bill , he said : " By restoring the Menominee Indian @#  | tribe to federal-trust status , the United States has at last made a clear reversal of a policy which was wrong , the policy of forcibly terminating Indian tribal status . " Termination Taught Some Lessons There are Menominees who still have doubts about a return to the fold . " All my life BIA has been the fly in the ointment , and it 's one thing I question about restoration , " said Delores Boyd , director of the Child Development Center . " I certainly would n't want youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handouts from the government . But is there any other way to save our land ? Though termination was wrong , it did have some good effects . Ten years ago we believed whatever the white man told us . Termination made people a bit more demanding of their rights . " Mrs. Boyd took me on a tour of the rambling old Bureau of Indian Affairs school that the Menominees had turned into a child-care center . Eying the 90 children in her charge , she said : " I hope we can give our children the pride they need . The real aim of our program is to make the kids Indians , and to do something about the major health problems that can hold them back all their lives . " The old bureau hospital is closed now ? turned into a courthouse after failing to meet modern standards . Two community-health nurses and a part-time National Health Service doctor bring medical care to the Menominees . Anemia , tuberculosis , and alcoholism are the major problems . 249  | Indian teachers like Mrs. Boyd are being recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the effort is dissipated further along . High-school students are bused to a neighboring county that has no Indian teachers and no Indians on its school board . Racial tensions have flared , and federal investigators have found discrimination . Under such conditions , more than 75 percent of the Menominees fail to graduate from high school and fewer than 4 percent see the inside of a college classroom . Carol Dodge has helped organize a community school for high-school dropouts as the first step in gaining local control of all Menominee schools . " Our public-school children just are n't given adequate backgrounds in the primary level , " she complained . " They leave fifth grade two years below their level , and , well , they just ca n't compete . " Miss Dodge , a Menominee with a graduate degree in education , sees the community school as a stopgap measure , but a beginning . " We have to spend too much time re-teaching the basic skills , " she told me . " In a few years these young people will be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add . " Troubled Boys Get Another Chance One day Steve and I drove to Thunderbird Ranch , a rolling 40-acre farm 20 miles outside Menominee County , to see another social and educational program in action . For three years Thunderbird Ranch has been home to several dozen Menominee boys who , because of school and family problems , are branded " delinquents " and taken over as wards of the County Welfare Department . Lou Hawpetoss , the director of the ranch , greeted us . " Poso , " he said , which means both hello and good-bye in Menominee , depending on the accent . In the fields half a dozen energetic 13-year-olds were riding bareback ( page 240 ) as the sun set behind the gleaming , whitewashed farmhouse . " These boys were at rock bottom , " Lou said . " Most have records that could put them in jail for a long time . Many have only one parent , often an alcoholic . They 'd all been kicked out of school in Shawano , and something had to be done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured man in braids , with a beaded headband . He hardly cuts the figure of the Chicago advertising executive he was before returning to " do something for my people . " Today he is tutor , father figure , pal , and official guardian . Adjusting his floppy felt hat , Lou told us the boys ' success story . " We put them in a different school , away from the racial problems of Shawano . Here , they are n't automatically expected to fail , and they 're developing a new self-image . Now most are getting B and C grades and learning a bit about small-scale farming at the same time . I would n't be surprised if one day maybe 15 years from now ? these kids were  | running a ranch for boys like themselves . " There are many Menominees like Hawpetoss , those who left the reservation in search of a better life , but were drawn back to their people by a sense of responsibility and a deep longing for home roots . Ted Boyd , 33-yearold vice-president of the Menominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as an accountant . " I always wanted to come back here some day , " Boyd said , " and I was lucky . My people needed someone with business experience . Many educated Menominees would like to come back , but there is n't much opportunity . " A New Era Dawns for Menominees As vice-president for financial affairs , Boyd has seen the Menominee economy seesaw . Corporation profits rose during the years Menominees sold the lakefront parcels of land . When land sales were halted in 1972 , corporation net profit fell to zero . But by March 1973 profits were up , chiefly because of the lumber operation , and Boyd now detects a trend toward " recovery and improvement . " He told me , " I think our workers ' attitude has improved because we are returning to reservation status . Now people really care and want to make it work . " My talk with Ted Boyd filled me with hope for our friends . As Steve and I took a final late-night walk through their land , our heads throbbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saying that the fighting Menominee spirit and binding tribal ties would not be weakened . At the county 's edge , I looked back and saw a sign I had casually passed many times before . Somehow , tonight , it meant much more . Its message was simple . Shining in the moonlight , it read : " Land of the Menominees ? We 'll make it ! "
