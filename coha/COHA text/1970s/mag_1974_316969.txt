Canada is one of the three largest foreign suppliers of crude oil to the U.S. It ships 800,000 bbl. daily to northern-tier states and the Midwest , accounting for 20% of U.S. imports , about equal to inflow from Nigeria . Last week the Canadian National Energy Board issued a report showing that the country could lose self-sufficiency by the early 1980s if exports to the U.S. continued at present levels . Accordingly , Ottawa 's Minister of Energy , Mines and Resources , Donald S. Macdonald , announced that exports to the U.S. would be cut by 100,000 bbl. by Jan. 1 , even more later in the year , and would possibly be phased out altogether by the 1980s unless Canadian production was increased . <P> Reason for the planned cutback , according to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau : Canada 's tar-sands oil reserve probably totals around 500 billion bbl. , equal to that of the Middle Eastern nations but contained in sands deep beneath the Alberta soil and thus far too expensive to tap . Canada can not even take full advantage of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes eastward from Alberta and Saskatchewan only to Toronto . Thus , while Canada exports some of its western production to the U.S. , it is forced to rely on imports to supply its eastern provinces . <P> By cutting back on outflow to the U.S. , Canada hopes to reserve oil for itself when the pipeline is eventually extended to Montreal , a project announced during last winter 's Arab oil embargo and originally scheduled for 1976 , but currently bogged down in financing . The unstated purpose of last week 's action was to pressure multinational oil companies , which have lately been pulling back on exploration because of increasing costs , into pressing ahead on development of the vast tar-sands deposits . At least one major company was not moved ; a spokesman for Mobil said that the Canadian action was all the more reason why the U.S. should move faster to develop its own resources .
