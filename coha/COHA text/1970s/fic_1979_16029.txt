Then other photographs of the performers of the 50 's and 60 's who lived with the same fire and intensity as Rose : James Dean , smiling enigmatically in " East of Eden " ; Marilyn Monroe , laughing as her skirt flares in the poster from " The Seven Year Itch " ; Jimmy Hendrix , grinning as he plays furiously ; Janis Joplin , cackling with pleasure as she performs . And possible people like : Jim Morrison , Lanny Bruce , Elvis , Buddy Holly , Otis Redding , etc . Over these photographs we hear Rose 's voice singing a quiet , simple song : &nbsp; ROSE 'S VOICESome say love , it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love , it is a reason That leaves your soul to bleed . Some say love , it is a hunger An endless , aching need I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . INT . GARAGE - WIDER ANGLE The photographers and reporters turn and file out , leaving the garage empty , but for Mal and Rose 's mother and father . The parents turn to go . Mal reaches up for the light , switches it off , leaving the screen in near darkness . We hold on the extinguished light . The song continues as the credits roll . &nbsp; ROSE 'S VOICEIt 's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It 's the dream afraid of waking That never takes a chance . It 's the one who wo n't be taken Who can not seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live .  --  98  --  When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong , Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun 's love In the spring becomes the rose .
