Between classes at Hollywood High , the outsized and unsightly girl known as " Barge " would sneak off to the girls ' room and stare at herself in the mirror . She pressed her nose against the glass so she could look into her eyes without seeing the rest of her face . And she would murmur over and over again : " Some day you 'll be beautiful . Some day you 'll be beautiful . " <P> It must have been a magic mirror . After 15 years , Sally Kellerman is one of the screen 's loveliest and most delightful comediennes , a fortuitous cross between Kay Kendall and Carole Lombard . Last week her work as Major " Hot Lips " Houlihan in the heretical M*A*S*H won her a nomination for an Academy Award . <P> Fat and Ugly . Sally 's hard-earned transformation began after a small part in a high school production of Meet Me in St. Louis . Hooked on the stage , she enrolled in acting classes with Jeff Corey , a respected character actor ( Seconds , Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really brought me out of myself for the first time in my life , " she says . Corey 's classes got her stage roles in Moon for the Misbegotten , and An Enemy of the People . Equally important , her cousin David Bennett , a fellow Corey student , appointed himself her unofficial protector and promoter . He turned up at her apartment early in the morning to roust her out for auditions . " David , David , " she would say , " I do n't wan na go , David , I 'm fat and ugly , David , and I do n't even want to be an actress . " David refused to listen , and Sally 's auditions eventually led to a couple of featured roles on television and a tiny part in Reform School Girl , " one of those American-International kind of movies where I played the weight lifter or something , " she remembers . Next came a part in The Boston Strangler . " I put on a bunch of bruises and decided I was n't going to worry any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' All right , I 'll take anything they 'll give me . ' " <P> They gave her The Third Day ( " I played a sex pervert " ) and The April Fools . " That was the knock on the head . When they finally sent me the script it was The Boston Strangler Revisited . I played another cold woman . But I went around for a lot of interviews before the film was released , and I could say that I had played Jack Lemmon 's wife . I made it sound like it was Sally and Jack all the way , instead of four lines . " <P> One of those interviews was with Director Robert Altman and Producer Ingo Preminger , who were looking for someone to play Hot Lips . " I thought , you know , terrific and all that . Then I looked at it . It was about three pages long . I was hysterical . I threw the script at Bob Altman and started yelling and crying at the same time . ' You son of a bitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you dirty bastard , whoever you are-it 's practically not even there ! ' ' Stop , stop ! ' Bob Altman says from behind the desk , where he 's hiding . ' You 're Hot Lips . You 've got to be Hot Lips . We 'll swing with it . We 'll try things . They 'll work . ' " She did , and they did .
