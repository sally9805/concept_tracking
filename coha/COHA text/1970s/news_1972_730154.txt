txt The body of . J. Edgar Hoover lay in state in the Capitol rotunda last week . President Nixon eulogized him : " J. Edgar Hoover was one of the giants ... those who stand head and shoulders above their countrymen , setting a high and noble standard for us all . " WASHINGTON  --  The death of J. Edgar Hoover brought an end to an era . That has been said of many men but in the case of Mr. Hoover  --  who , at 77 , had been director of the Federal'Bureau of Investigation for 48 years  --  it was really true . The Hoover Era almost exactly spanned the years since the United States emerged from World War I to find itself a world power ; and in the half-century that followed , he became one of the few constants in a rapidly changing nation , an endlessly evolving society . The director 's views and values never ceased to reflect the vanished America that had shaped him ; but his remarkable combination of bureaucratic and political skills , public relations genius , dictatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and status in Washington through Prohibition , Depression , the gangster days of the thirties , World War II , the Cold War , Korea , Vietnam and the radical political activism of the sixties . Eight Presidents depended on or tolerated him ; Congress feared and favored him , from the " red scares " of the early twenties to the trial of Philip Berrigan ; and he became the only high public official for whom the Federal retirement rules were specifically set aside so that he could serve on , as it seemed , forever . When his housekeeper found him , one morning last week , slumped by his bed , dead of natural causes , even J. Edgar Hoover 's enemies  --  by whom the truculent old man liked to say he had been " distinguished " ? conceded that his like would not be seen again . For many Americans , that was a relief ; but for others , Mr. Hoover 's death symbolized the passing of much that they had valued  --  oldfashioned patriotism ; rigid " moral " values ; a stern code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strident demands of minorities , young people , liberated women , gays ; and a view of " law and order " as the first priority of government . Both for them , and for those others who believed Mr. Hoover had outlasted his time , the question of his successor was a matter of vital importance . The director , after all , had presided over one of the major agencies of the Federal Government ; he had almost unlimited powers over its thousands of agents and its substantial budget ; he had custody of its massive accumulation of reports , files , fingerprints , dossiers ; he had , by custom and necessity , direct links to any man who might sit in the White House ; and thus he had the potential for extending a vast and effective secret police system into the life of virtually every American . J. Edgar Hoover had personally had that potential ; the question whether his successor also should have it could hardly be answered without searching study of the way Mr. Hoover had handled it . The historical record is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to the end of World War II , few officials had earned such esteem , in making an honest , efficient and feared Federal force of what had been a corrupt and sleazy agency ; in developing scientific investigative techniques ; in the F.B.I . ' s effective wars on bank robbery and kidnapping and the gangsterism of Depression days ; in its successful counterespionage activities during World War II . In these achievements and more , J. Edgar Hoover compiled a remarkable personal record . With his flair for publicity  --  he invented the " Ten Most Wanted " list and shrewdly cooperated in " G-Man " movies and radio programs  --  he made himself a legend in the nation ; and with his masterly bureaucracy , he made himself a fixture in Washington . But the post-war era brought new problems . Hot war became cold war ; in its late Stalinist phase , Communism became the new international threat . Seen as a revolutionary and aggressive ideology , its intrusion from abroad into American life seemed a more formidable " fifth column " than the spies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was J. Edgar Hoover 's F.B.I . that had taken care of the latter , it became the new mission of the G-Men to take on the Communists . But the task was subtly , perhaps fatally different ; the Communist threat , if it had any substance at all , was far more a matter of domestic subversion than of foreign agents . Thus it was that the F.B.I . moved into what a group of academic and other specialists on the agency , meeting last year at Princeton , concluded was now its principal concern  --  domestic political surveillance . Moreover , Mr. Hoover 's public relations techniques , glorifying his agency 's mortal combat with the " masters of deceit " in the Communist " movement , " probably contributed as much as any other single factor to the virulent anti-Communism of the public and its politicians in the fifties and early sixties ; and that public attitude had its effect on Government policies , from the nonrecognition of Communist China to the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs . Concurrently to those Americans less fearful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.B.I . ' s political surveillance came to seem an alarming secret-police threat ; in some ways , that fear may have been little more justified than the fear of Communists , but it nevertheless began to undermine confidence in the F.B.I . and in J. Edgar Hoover personally . Despite its front-page warfare on Communism , it also began to be apparent in the late fifties and early sixties that the bureau had been considerably less than alert , eager and effective in protecting the civil rights of blacks , and ofwhites who tried to help them in the years of upheaval that followed the Supreme Court 's order for the desegregation of schools . President Kennedy had made the reappointment of Mr. Hoover the first order of business after his election in 1960 , but Robert Kennedy , arriving at the Justice Department intent on wiping out organized crime , found that the F.B.I . scarcely admitted the existence of organized crime . Students of the agency contend that these deficiences , too , were to some extent the result of F.B.I . concentration on Communism  --  which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rewarding in publicity and bigger budgets than organized crime . During the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations , these defects were to some extent rectified ; but as black and antiwar militance became powerful in the sixties , the domestic surveillance of the F.B.I . became more and more extensive . In recent years , therefore , the director and the F.B.I . he created had become engulfed in controversy , primarily as to the agency 's surveillance and Mr. Hoover 's personal activities  --  such as the feud with the Rev. Dr , Martin Luther King and his powerful political opposition to a consular treaty with the Soviet Union . The director , was charged also with letting his agency 's general effectiveness slip . Critics thought both were outdated  --  that the F.B.I . National Academy , for instance , reflecting Mr. Hoover 's views , taught little that was relevant to the modern problems of police in central cities . They said F.B.I . agents were overwhelmed by Mr. Hoover 's bureaucratic demands and intimidated by his dictatorial discipline . But J. Edgar Hoover was never charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long pull , his stewardship of the F.B.I . files was reasonably good  --  but just flawed enough to suggest the damage that could be done by a weaker or less scrupulous successor . His long career suggests ; first , therefore , a replacement with a reassuring public reputation for strength and integrity , as well as one more in tune with the last third of the twentieth century than the first third . Law enforcement experience seems equally necessary , as well as freedom from entangling political commitments . Whether structural changes in the F.B.I. ? for instance , the separation of its counter-espionage mission from its crime-fighting function  --  are also necessary is certain to be a matter of public and political debate , President Nixon implicitly recognized the complexity of these questions and the importance of finding a new director in whom the nation can have confidence , when he named Assistant Atorney General L. Patrick Gray as an interim choice , and promised a permanent selection to whoever takes the Presidential oath next January . - TOME WICKER         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
