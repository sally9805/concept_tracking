Programmer Fred Silverman has made ABC No. 1 <P> From his office on the 38th floor of the ABC building in Manhattan , Fred Silverman can peer into the office of CBS President Robert Wussler , just across 53rd Street . Occasionally the two men wave at each other from the heights , like rival aviators saluting before a dogfight . But sometimes-when he is trying to woo a star away from another network or plan a secret strategy-Silverman , head of ABC 's programming , draws his drapes : if he can look into Wussler 's office , Wussler can look into his , and Silverman does not want anyone , especially anyone at CBS , to know where the Red Baron will strike next . <P> Invigorated by Silverman 's frenzied aggressiveness and unorthodox tactics , ABC-television 's perennial also-ran in ratings , revenues and prestige-has all but obliterated its competitors in evening prime time . Last spring , at the end of the 1976-77 season , the network had the nation 's four top-rated shows and seven of the top ten . CBS , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' 50s , managed to squeeze only two into the top ten . NBC , the granddaddy of all the networks , was able to place only one on those elevated rungs . <P> Translated into Nielsen points , the language TV people are most fluent in , ABC had a Nielsen average of 21.5 , compared with 18.7 for CBS and 18.0 for NBC . Since each Nielsen point means a million viewers and is worth about $36 million in advertising revenue on a full-season basis , ABC 'S lead was equal to $100.8 million - and that is a language anyone can understand . <P> There is no parallel in the history of broadcasting-and few in any well-established industries-to ABC 's sudden rise . It is as if , in the space of two years , Chrysler had surged past General Motors and sent Ford reeling back to Dearborn . Or - to stretch the truth only a bit-as if China had discovered some mysterious , all-powerful Z-bomb and in victorious glee ordered both the White House and the Kremlin dismantled and shipped , boards and nails , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliated stations , convincing station owners that they will be able to ask more money from local advertisers if they are connected with ABC hits . One month the NBC affiliate in San Diego or Charlotte , N.C. , makes the switch . Another month it is the CBS station in Providence or Albany , N.Y . In the past two years ABC has added 15 stations to its web , for a total of 195 . CBS and NBC are still ahead in the number of stations , with 204 and 208 respectively , but no one will guess how long traditional loyalties will survive the siren lure of ABC 's Nielsens . <P>
