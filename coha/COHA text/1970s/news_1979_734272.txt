txt AT THE " OLD-Fashioned Fourth of July Celebration " held on the steps of the Chicago Historical Society , the Catholic Youth Organization Band gave the concert , a rabbi gave the invocation and benediction , and a white , Anglo-Saxon Protestant gave the oration . At the World Patriotism Day picnic in Grant Park , black Muslims picnicked with their families while Hare Krishnas wandered among them , black motorcycle club members revved ther bikes , and an American Indian walked around carrying his headdress . At the antidraft rally in Lincoln Park , a speaker said American history was a " stupid 204 sic years of oppression , " a girl quoted Lenin to a friend , and a boy went around asking , ' Are there any petitions to sign ? " It was July 4 , 1979 , and the melting pot was bubbling . AS THE DAY began , the crowd that gathered at the Historical Society hunched in the cold wind , looking like huddled masses yearning to breathe some nice warm air . Close-up with Dorothy Collin They listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Redcoats . The men dressed as British soldiers were members of the 8th Regiment of Foot , part of a group that re-enacts battles , and " our regiment was the only one that was in Illinois " during the Revolutionary War , Bill Potter said . " They came through to gather up Indians for various campaigns . " The captain of the regiment issued a command . He had a British accent . " I came here 13 , : a years ago , " Stanley Rayner , the captain , said . " I came for two years , but we liked it and decided // Fourth of July , 1979 ; the melting pot-bubbles // to stay . While I was studying for my United States citizenship . I had a good friend who was engaged in putting together a U.S. revolutionary regiment . - We thought it would be good to have some opposition at the time of the Bicentennial . But it was a devilish job getting Americans to join the British . " THE REDCOATS marched off , past Kathy Wendt who was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag sticking out of her purse . " I love the old-fashioned type of Fourth and no kind of weather can stop me , " she said . The sun began to come out as the band played " America the Beautiful . " And some of the children began to tire . " Do you want to go for a walk ? " a mother asked a screaming child . " No , I want to go home , " the child wailed . " That 's not very patriotic , " the mother said . The patriotic speeches began . In Rabbi Hayim Perelmuter 's invocation , he talked of the " rich variety of people " that make up America , " whose faces reflect the infinite variety of mankind and whose ability to live together is an inspiration for us all . " Harold K. Skramstad Jr. , director of the Historial Society , read the Declaration of Independence . lie seemed to put special emphasis on the end where the signers " pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that was fascinating then was the degree to which people really pledged themselves . That was the difference between special interests and a nation . It was critical then and it is critical now . " That was the theme of the oration given by U.S. Rep. John Anderson , the Republican from Rockford who wants to be President . He quoted Thomas Paine 's " The Crisis " : " These are the times that try men 's souls . The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will , in this crisis , shrink from the service of his country . " " If there is a crisis today , it is not a crisis of conflict , but of the spirit , " Anderson said . " We have become a nation of special interests . We have lost the sense of national purpose that welded us together . Let us seek to recapture that national purpose and spirit that gave new hope to the world . " AS ANDERSON talked , anti-abortion demonstrators yelled : " Murder of unborn babies . " The congressman silenced them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom that " those who interrupt this public assembly have the right they enjoy . " After the speeches , the Redcoats marched out to give a demonstration of loading and firing their British Brown Bess muskets . A couple of them had some trouble loading . " No wonder they lost the war , " a man laughed . Close-up The Ft . Dearborn Frontiersmen , representatives of the American side , loaded and f ire d Pennsylvania Rifles . " Those guys make fire , too , " a little boy said as the Frontiersmen blasted away . Down in Grant Park , the blasts were corning from the motorcycle clubs as they vroomed into the park . They roared past a group of Chinese youths wearing jackets with " Dragon " on the back , past a group of Mexican-American horsemen looking like travel posters for old Mexico , and past Sheila Jeanette Clay . SHEILA HAD marched in the parade along Michigan Avenue and was quite a sight . She wore a " $1,000 dress to show the elegance of women , and Army coat in memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son is always playing basketball , " and a huge cook 's hat which she could fill with air " if I had enough breath left to do it , " she said , laughing . She wheeled a sculpture she had done portraying the parade theme of " Pride and Dignity . " A rolling pin and wooden spoons stuck up from it . Sheila was a long way from the usual plastic Chicago parade float . So was The Tin Man , Dale Harris . Harris wore a sheet metal top and hat modeled after what The Tin Man wore in " The Wizard of Oz . " He also imitated The Tin Man 's jerky movements , which was a little difficult since he was wearing roller skates . HE SAT FOR a while on a motorcycle . Someone dressed as The Tin Man , wearing roller skates , astride a huge Honda , adds a certain something to any parade and picnic . Them were also speeches in Grant Park . The Rev. Ralph Abernathy , head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Dr. Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talked of Thomas Jefferson and King and Malcolm X and Jesus and of all men being created equal . In Lincoln Park , the speeches were about the draft and about the " imperialistic monster . " " We 're going to stand with the people in the world to fight the imperialistic monster , " said a girl , lapsing into the good , old protest rhetoric of " people 's struggles " and " revolutionary dreams . " VARIOUS GROUPS had tables with literature and petitions on them . " It seems kind of quiet , " said a woman behind the Coalition Against Registration and the Draft table . " I guess maybe because it 's a new movement , " a man said . Near him , a flag waved . It was being used as a symbol of the " new movement . " It said : " Do n't tread on me. "
