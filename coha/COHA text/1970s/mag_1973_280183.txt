The Santa Ana Register , a conservative daily in California 's Orange County , caused quite a stir last month . It reported that federal investigators were looking into whether President Nixon had used as much as $1,000,000 in unreported 1968 campaign contributions to buy his opulent San Clemente estate . The White House instantly denounced the report as " totally unfounded " and promised to supply a full explanation within 24 hours . <P> The statement was finally released eleven days later-but was so full of complex figures and tortured explanations that it raised many questions . It did reveal that the President had borrowed $625,000 from a friendly industrialist in connection with the purchase ; that Nixon bought the property and later sold an interest in part of it to a still unnamed investment company ; and that he ultimately made a good deal for himself . The industrialist-lender was Robert Abplanalp , the aerosol spray-valve tycoon . Still another of Nixon 's helpful millionaire friends , C. Arnholt Smith , gained unwonted attention last week . He was in deep trouble with the Securities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; BUSINESS ) . <P> As the White House tells it , Nixon and Wife Pat took a fancy in 1969 to the ten-room , Spanish-style house in San Clemente where the late millionaire real estate developer Henry Hamilton Cotton liked to entertain his fellow Democrats , once including Franklin Roosevelt . The Nixons wanted only the house and a parcel of 5.9 acres , but the Cotton heirs insisted on selling the entire property , covering 24.6 acres . To swing the deal , the Nixons agreed to pay $1.4 million , with $400,000 in cash and a $1,000,000 mortgage . <P> For the cash , Nixon borrowed heavily from Abplanalp . In 1970 he took a second loan from Abplanalp after buying a small adjacent parcel of land . The two loans put the President in debt to Abplanalp for $625,000 , on personal promissory notes at 8% interest . <P> This transaction raised some still unanswered questions . <P> First , why were details of the purchase concealed for so long ? When the deed covering the Nixons ' original purchase was registered on July 15 , 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the real buyers were unnamed . The buyer of record was the Title Insurance &; Trust Co. of Los Angeles , which was the Nixons ' trustee . A rich or famous buyer may follow this procedure to avoid boosting the prices of nearby property skyhigh . But , says Carlyle , " I 've seen only one other deed like it , and that was for Disneyland . " <P> Another question : Was it wise for the President to be so deeply indebted to one businessman ? According to the White House , Nixon paid back the loans in December of 1970 , by selling 18.7 acres of the San Clemente land to " an investment company set up by Mr. Abplanalp . " In this deal , Abplanalp wiped out the $625,000 debt and took over mortgages totaling another $624,000 . In effect that meant Abplanalp paid $1,249,000 to the Nixons for the 18.7 acres-just about the going rate for such property .
