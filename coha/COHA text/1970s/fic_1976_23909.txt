Nadine Gordimer A SOLDIER 'S EMBRACE A story in the related minor T HE DAY THE CEASE-FIRE was signed she was caught in a crowd . Peasant boys from Europe who had made up the colonial army and freedom fighters whose column had marched into town were staggering about together outside the barracks , not three blocks from her house , in whose rooms , for ten years , she had heard the blurred parade-ground bellow of colonial troops being trained . The men were n't drunk . They linked and swayed across the street ; because everything had come to a stop , everything had to come to a stop : they surrounded cars , bicycles , vans , nannies with children , women with loaves of bYead or basins of mangoes on their heads , a road gang with picks and shovels , a Coca-Cola truck , an old man with a barrow who bought bottles and bones . They were grinning and laughing amazement that it could be : there they were , bumping into each other 's bodies in joy , looking into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting . The words were in languages not mutually comprehensible , but the cries were new , a whooping and crowing all understood . She was bumped and jostled and she let go , stopped trying to move in any self-determined direction . There were two soldiers in front of her , blocking her off by their clumsy embrace ( how do you do it , how do you do what you 've never done before ) and the embrace opened like a door and took her in  --  a pink hand with bitten nails grasping her right arm , a black hand with a big-dialed watch and thong bracelet pulling at her left elbow . Their three heads collided gaily ; musk of sweat and tang of strong sweet soap clapped a mask to her nose and mouth . They all gasped with delicious shock . They were saying things to each other . She put up an arm around each neck , the rough pile of an army haircut on oneside , the soft Negro hair on the other , and kissed them both on the cheek . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms , jogging heads ; she was returned to and took up the will of her direction again  --  she was walking home from the post office , where she had just sent a telegram to relatives abroad : ALL CALM DO N'T WORRY . HE LAWYER CAME BACK early from his offices because the courts were not sitting , although the official celebration holiday was not until the next day . He described to his wife the rally before the town hall , which he had watched from the office building balcony . One of the guerrilla leaders ( not the most important ; he on whose head the biggest price had been laid would not venture so soon and deep into the territory so newly won ) had spoken for two hours from the balcony of the town hall . " Brilliant . Their jaws dropped . Brilliant . They 've never heard anything on that level : precise , reasoned  --  none of them would ever have believed it possible , out of the bush . You should have seen de Poorteer 's face . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth like that . And be listened to like that . " The governor 's handicap did not even bring the sympathy accorded to a stammer : he paused and gulped between words . The blacks had always used a portmanteau name for him that meant " **46;2180;TOOLONG . " One of the members of the black underground organization that could now come out in brass-band support of the freedom fighters had recognized the lawyer across from the official balcony and given the freedom fighters ' salute . The lawyer joked about it , miming , full of pride . " You should have been there  --  should have seen him , up there in the official party . I told you  --  really  --  you ought to have conic to town with me this morning . " " And what did you do ? " She wanted to assemble all details . " Oh , I gave the salute in return , chaps in the street saluted me ... everybody was doing it . it vas marvelous . And the police standing by ; just to think , last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Like thumbing your nose at them , " she said , smiling . " Did any thing go on around here ? " " Muchanga was afraid to go out all day . He would n't even run up to the post office for me ! " Their servant had come to them many years ago , from service in the house of her father , an official in the Treasury . " Bat there was no excitement ? " She told him : " The soldiers and some freedom fighters mingled outside the barracks . I got caught for a minute or two . They were dancing about ; you could n't get through . All very good-natured  --  oh , I sent . the cable . " A N ACCOLADE , one side a white cheek , the other a black . The white one she kissed on the left cheek , the black one on the right cheek , as if these were two sides of one face . That vision , version , was like a poster ; the sort of thing that was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of wrangling talks preliminary to the takeover by the black government went by . To begin with , the cheek was not white but pale or rather sallow , the poor boy 's pallor of winter in Europe ( that company must have only just arrived and not yet seen service ) with homesick pimples sliced off by the discipline of an army razor . And the cheek was not black but opaque peat-dark , waxed with sweat round the plump contours of the nostril . As if she could return to the moment again , she saw what she had not consciously noted : there had been a narrow pink strip in the darkness near the ear , the sort of tender stripe of healed flesh revealed when a scab is nicked off a little before it is ripe . The scab must have cone away that morning : the young man had picked at it in the troop carrier or truck ( whatever it was the freedom fighters had the colony had been told for years that they were supplied by the Chinese and Russians indiscriminately ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to newspaper reports , the day would have ended for the two young soldiers in drunkenness and whoring . She was , apparently , not yet too old to belong to the soldier 's embrace of all that a land mine in the bush might have exploded forever . The opportunity takenby a woman not young enough to be clasped in the arms of the one who ( the same newspaper , while the war was on , expressing the fears of the colonists for their women ) would be expected to rape her . She considered this version . She had not kissed on the mouth , she had not sought anonymous lips and tongues in the license of festival . Yet she had kissed . Watching herself again , she knew that . She had  --  God knows why  --  kissed them on either cheek , his left , his right . It was deliberate , if a swift impulse : she had distinctly made the move . She did not tell what happened not because her husband would suspect license in her , but because he would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of an enlightened white colonial official , married to a white liberal lawyer well known for his defense of blacks in political trials  --  as giving free expression to liberal principles . She had not told , she did not know what had happened . She thought of a time long ago when a school camp had gone to the sea and immediately on arrival everyone had run down to the beach from the train , tripping and tearing over sand dunes of wild fig , aghast with ecstatic shock at the meeting with the water . E POORTEER WAS RECALLED , and the lawyer remarked to one of their black friends , " The crane has choked on the bullfrog . I hear that 's what they 're saying in the Quarter . " The priest , who came from the black slum that had always been known simply by that anonymous term , did not respond with any sort of glee . His reserve implied it was easy to celebrate ; there were people who " shouted freedom too loud all of a sudden . " The lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shouted freedom when it was dangerous to do so , and gone to prison several times for it , while certain people now on the Interim Council set up to run the country until the new government took over , had kept silent . He named a few , but reluctantly . Enough to confirm their own suspicions  --  men who perhaps had made some deal with the colonial power to place its interests first , no matter what sort of government emerged from the new constitution ? Yet when the couple plunged into discussion their friend left them talking to each other while he drank his beer and gazed , frowning as if at a headache or because the sunset light hurt his eyes behind his spectacles , round her huge-leaved tropical plants that bowered the terrace in cool humidity . They had always been rather proud of their friendship with him , this man in a cassock who wore a clenched fist carved of local ebony as well as a silver cross round his neck . His black face was habitually stern  --  a high seriousness balanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fist  --  but never inattentively ill at ease . " What was the matter ? " She answered herself ; " I had the feeling he did n't want to come here . " She was using a paper handkerchief dipped in gin to wipe an aphid off the back of a pale new leaf that had shaken itself from its folds like a cutout paper lantern . " Good Lord , he " s been here hundreds of times . "  - -  Before , yes . " W HAT THINGS WERE THEY saying ? With the shouting in the street and the swaying of the crowd , the sweet powerful presence that confused the senses so that sound , sight , stink ( sweat , cheap soap ) ran into one tremendous sensation , she could not make out words that came so easily . Not even what she herself must have said . FEW WEALTHY WHITE MEN who had been boastful in their support of the colonial war and knew they would be marked down by the blacks as archexploiters , left at once . Good riddance , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had lived contentedly under the colonial government without questioning its actions now expressed an enthusiastic intention to help build a nation , as the newspapers put it . The lawyer 's wife 's neighborhood butcher was one . " I do n't mind blacks , " he was expansive with her , in his shop that he had occupied for twelve years on a license available only to white people . " Makes no difference to me who you arc so long as you 're honest . " Next to a chart showing a beast mapped according to the cuts of meat it provided , he had hung a picture of the most important leader of the freedom fighters , expected to be the first president . People like the butcher turned out with their babies clutching pennants when the leader drove through the town from the airport . There were incidents ( newspaper euphemism again ) in the Quarter . It was to be expected . Political factions , tribally based , who had not fought the war , wanted to share power with the freedom fighters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his day off . His friends came to see him and sat privately on their hunkers near the garden compost heap . The ugly mansions of the rich who had fled stood empty on the bluff above the sea , but it was said they would make money out of them W. ? they would be bought as ambassadorial residences when independence came , and many black and yellow diplomats . Zealots who claimed they belonged to the party burned shops and houses of the poorer whites who lived , as the lawyer said , - in the inevitable echelon of colonial society , " closest to the Quarter . A house in the lawyer 's street was noticed by his wife to be accommodating what was certainly one of those families , in the outbuildings ; green nylon curtains had appeared at the garage window , she reported . The suburb was pleasantly overgrown and well to do ; no one rich , just white professional people and professors from the university . The barracks was empty now , except for an old man with a stump and a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , who sat on a beer crate at the gates . He had lost his job as night watchman when one of the rich people went away , and was glad to have work . The street had been perfectly quiet ; except for that first day . HE FINGERNAILS she sometimes still saw clearly were bitten down until embedded in a thin line of dirt all round , in the pink blunt fingers . The thumb and thick fingertips were turned back coarsely even while grasping her . Such hands had never been allowed to take possession . They were permanently raw , so young , from unloading coal , digging potatoes from the frozen Northern Hemisphere , washing hotel dishes . He had not been killed , and now that the day of the cease-fire was over he would be delivered hack to the docks , the stony farm , the scullery of the grand hotel . He would have to do anything he could get . There was unemploy-ment in Europe where he had returned , the army did n't need all the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chipande , was coming home from exile . They heard over the radio he was expected , accompanying the future president as confidential secretary , and they waited to hear from him . The lawyer put up his feet on the empty chair where the priest had sat , shifting it to a comfortable position by hooking his toes , free in sandals , through the slats . " Imagine . Chipande ! " Chipande had been almost a prot  --  g ? - - but they did n't like the term , it smacked of patronage . Tall . cocky , casual Chipande , a boy from the slummiest part of the Quarter , was recommended by the White Fathers ' Mission ( was it by Father Mulumbua himself ? ? the lawyer thought so , his wife was not sure they remembered correctly ) as a bright kid who Nadine Gordirner A SOLDIER 'S EMBRACE wanted to he articled to a lawyer . That was asking a lot , in those days  --  nine years ago . He never finished his apprenticeship because while he and his employer were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories from the books in the house he was made free of , he became so involved in politics that he had to skip the country one jump ahead of a detention order signed by the **43;2228;TOOLONG . After two weeks , the lawyer phoned the offices the **31;2273;TOOLONG had set up openly in the town but apparently Chipande had an office in the former colonial secretariat . There he had a secretary or receptionist of his own ; he was n't easy to reach . The lawyer left a message . The lawyer and his wife saw from the newspaper pictures lie had n't changed much : he had a heard and had adopted the Muslim cap favored by political circles in exile on the East Coast , that 's all . He did come to the house eventually . He had the distracted , insistent friendliness of one who has no time to reestablish intimacy ; it must be taken as read . And it must not be displayed . When he remarked on a shortage of accommodation for exiles now become officials , and the lawyer said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was welcome to move in and regard a self-contained part of it as his private living quarters , he did not answer but went on talking generalities . The lawyer 's wife mentioned Father Mulumbua , whom they had not seen since just after the cease-fire . The lawyer added , " There 's obviously some sort of big struggle going on , he 's fighting for his political life there in the Quarter . " " Again , " she said , drawing them into a reminder of what had only just become their past . But Chipande was restlessly following with his gaze the movements of old Muchanga , drag . ging the hose from plant to plant , careless of the spray ; " You remember who this is , Muchanga ? " she had said when the visitor arrived , yet although the old man had given , in their own language . the sort of respectful greeting even an elder gives a young man whose clothes and hearing denote rank and authority , he was not in any way overwhelmed or enthusiastic ; perhaps he secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latest whites to leave the country people who had got themselves quickly involved in the sort of currency swindles that draw more outrage than any other kind of crime , in a new state fearing the flight of capital : " Let them go , let them go . Good riddance . " And he turned to talk of other things there were so many more important questions to occupy the attention of the three old friends . But Chipande could n't stay . Chipande could not stay for supper ; his beautiful long velvety black hands with their pale lining ( as she thought of the palms ) hung impatiently between his knees while he sat forward in the chair , explaining , adamant against persuasion . He should not have been there , even now ; he had official business waiting . Sometimes he drafted correspondence until one or two in the morning . The lawyer remarked how there had n't been a proper chance to talk ; he wanted to discuss those fellows in the Interim Council Mulurabua was so warily distrustful of  --  what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something dismissing and very slightly disparaging , not about the council members but of Mulumhua  --  a reference to his connection with the Jesuit missionaries as an influence that " comes through . " " But I must make a note to see him sometime . " It seemed that even black men who presented a threat to the party could be discussed only among black men themselves , now . Chipande put an arm around each of his friends as for the brief official moment of a photograph , left them ; he who used to sprawl on the couch arguing half the night before dossing down in the lawyer 's pajamas . " As soon as I 'm settled I 'll contact you . You 'll be around , ay ? " " Oh , we 'll be around . " The lawyer laughed , referring , for his part , to those who were no longer . " Glad to see you 're not driving a Mercedes ! " he called with reassured affection at the sight of Chipande getting into a modest car . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the necessity for African leaders to live simply when they came to power ! On the terrace to which he turned back , Muchanga was doing something extraordinary  --  wetting a dirty rag with Gilbey 's . It was supposed to be his day off anyway ; why was he messing about with the plants when one wanted peace to talk undisturbed ? " Is those thing again , those thing is killing the leaves . " " For heaven 's sake , he could use methylated for that ! Any kind of alcohol will do ! Why do n't you get him some ? " There were shortages of one kind and another in the country , and gin happened to be something in short supply . W HATEVER THE HAND had done in the bush had not coarsened it . It , too , was suede-black , and elegant . The pale lining was hidden against her own skin where the hand grasped her left elbow . Strangely , black does not show toil  --  she remarked this as one remarks the quality of a fabric . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chipande 's . The watch a fine pieceof equipment for a fighter . There was something next to it , in fact looped over the strap by the angle of the wrist as the hand grasped . A bit of thong with a few beads knotted where it was joined as a bracelet . Or amulet . Their babies wore such things , often their first and only garment . Grandmothers or mothers attached it as protection . It had worked ; he was alive at cease-fire . Some had been too deep in the bush to know , and had been killed after the fighting was over . He had pumped his head wildly and laughingly at whatever it was she ? they  --  had been babbling . HE LAWYER HAD MORE free time than he 'd ever remembered . So many of his clients had left ; he was deputed to collect their rents and pay their taxes for them , in the hope that their property was n't going to be confiscated  --  there had been alarmist rumors among such people since the day of the cease-fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over possessions , whether in the form of the children of dissolved marriages or the houses and cars claimed by divorced wives . The Africans had their own ways of resolving such redistribution of goods . And a gathering of elders under a tree was sufficient to settle a dispute over boundaries or argue for and against the guilt of a woman accused of adultery . He had had a message , in a roundabout way , that he might be asked to be consultant on constitutional law to the party , but nothing seemed to come of it . He took home with him the proposals for the draft constitution he had managed to get hold of . He spent whole afternoons in his study making notes for counter or improved proposals he thought he would send to Chipande or one of the other people he knew in high positions : every time he glanced up , there through his open windows was Muchanga 's little company at the bottom of the garden . Once , when he saw they had straggled off , he wandered down himself to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when he used to work twelve hours a day at the office ) . They ate dried shrimps from the market : that 's what they were doing ! The ground was full of bitten-off heads and black eyes on stalks . His wife smiled . " They bring them . Muchanga wo n't go near the market since the riot . " " It 's ridiculous . Who 's going to harm him ? " There was even a suggestion that the lawyer might apply for a professorship at the university . The chair of the Faculty of Law was vacant , since the students had demanded the expulsion of certain professors engaged during the colonial regime  --  in particular the fuddy-duddy ( good riddance ) who had gathered dust in the law chair , and the quite decent young man ( pity about him ) who had had political science . But what professor of political science could expect to survive both a colonial regime and the revolutionary regime that defeated it ? The lawyer and his wife decided that since he might still be appointed in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep out of the university context , where the students were shouting for Africanization , anyway , and even an appointee with his credentials as a fighter of legal battles for blacks against the colonial regime in the past might not escape their ire . Newspapers sent by friends from over the border gave statistics for the number of what they termed " refugees " who were entering the neighboring country . The papers from outside also featured sensationally the inevitable mistakes and misunderstandings , in a new administration , that led to several foreign businessmen being held for investigation by the new regime . For the last fifteen years of colonial rule , Gulf had been drilling for oil in the territory , and it was certain that all sorts of questionable people , from the point of view of the regime 's determination not to be exploited in ideological or economic terms , would try to gain concessions . His wife said , " The butcher 's gone . " He was home , reading at his desk ; he could spend the day more usefully there than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left after breakfast with her fisherman 's basket that she liked to use for shopping , she was n't away twenty minutes . " You mean the shop 's dosed ? " There was nothing in the basket . She must have turned and come straight home . " Gone . It 's empty . He 's cleared out over the weekend . " She sat down suddenly on the edge of the desk ; and after a moment of silence , both laughed shortly , a strange , secret , complicit laugh . " Why , do you think ? " " Ca n't say . He certainly charged , if you wanted a decent cut . But meat 's so hard to get , now ; I thought it was worth it  --  justified . " The lawyer raised his eyebrows and pulled down his mouth : " Exactly . " They understood ; the man probably knew he was marked to run into trouble for profiteering  --  he must have been paying through the nose for his supplies on the black market , anyway , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed and loafers ( there had always been a lot of unemployed hanging around for the pickings of the town ) who felt the new regime should entitle them to take what they dared not before . Radio and television shops were the most favored objective for gangs who adopted the freedom fighters ' slogans . Transistor radios were the portable luxuries of street life ; thenew regime issued solemn warnings , over thos same radios , that looting and violence woul be firmly dealt with but it was difficult for th police to be everywhere at once . Sometime their actions became street battles , since th struggle with the looters changed character supporters of the party 's rival political faction joined in with the thieves against the polict It was necessary to be ready to reverse dire ( tion , quickly turning down a side street in de tour if one encountered such disturbances whil driving around town . There were bodies some times ; both husband and wife had been forte nate enough not to see any close up , so far . I company of the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed ii the barracks to supplement the police force they patrolled the Quarter , mainly . Muchanga ' friend kept his job as gatekeeper althougl there were armed sentries on guard : the law yer 's wife found that a light touch to mentioi in letters to relatives in Europe . " Where 'll you go now ? " She slid off the desk and picked up her has ket . " Supermarket , I suppose . Or turn vege tartan . " He knew that she left the room quick ly , smiling , because she did n't want him to sug gest Muchanga ought to be sent to look for fist in the markets along the wharf in the Quarter Muchanga was being allowed to indulge in al-manner of eccentric refusals ; for no reason , um less out of some curious sentiment about he , father ? S HE AVOIDED WALKING past the barracks because of the machine guns the young sentries had in place of rifles . Rifles pointed into the air but machine gum pointed to the street at the level of different parts of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies slung on mother 's backs , the round heads of children , her fisherman 's basket  --  she knew she was getting like the others : what she felt was afraid . She wondered what the butcher and his wife had said to each other . Because he was at least one whom she had known . He had sold the meat she had bought that these women and their babies passing her in the street had n't had the money to buy . T WAS SOMETHING quite unexpected and outside their own efforts that decided it . A friend over the border telephoned and offered a place in a lawyer 's firm of high-est repute there , and some prestige in the world at large , since the team had defended in-dividuals fighting for freedom of the press and militant churchmen upholding freedom of con-science on political issues . A telephone call ; as simple as that . The friend said ( and the lawyer did not repeat this even to his wife ) they would be proud to have a man of his courage and convictions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uphold the liberal principles everyone knew he had always stood for ; there were many whites , in that country still ruled by a white minority , who deplored the injustices under which their black population suffered , et cetera , and believed you could n't ignore the need for peaceful change , et cetera . His offices presented no problem ; something called Africa Seabeds ( Formosan Chinese who had gained a concession to ship seaweed and dried shrimps in exchange for rice ) took over the lease and the typists . The senior clerks and the current articled clerk ( the lawyer had always given a chance to young blacks , long before other people had come round to it  --  it was n't only the secretary to the president who owed his start to him ) he managed to get employed by the new Trades Union Council ; he still knew a few blacks who remembered the times he had acted for black workers in disputes with the colonial government . The house would just have to stand empty , for the time being . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do for a charge d'affaires  --  it was left in the hands of a half-caste letting agent who was likely to stay put : only whites were allowed in , at the country over the border . Getting money out was going to be much more difficult than disposing of the house . The lawyer would have to keep coming back , so long as this remained practicable , hoping to find a loophole in exchange control regulations . She was deputed to engage the movers . In their innocence , they had thought it as easy as that ! Every large vehicle , let alone a moving van , was commandeered for months ahead . She had no choice but to grease a palm , although it went against her principles ; it was condoning a practice they believed a young black state must stamp out before corruption took hold . He would take his entire legal library , for a start ; that was the most important possession , to him . Neither was particularly attached to furniture . She did not know what there was she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahd that was out of the question . She could not even mention it . She did not want to leave her towering plants , mostly natives of South America and not Africa , she supposed , whose aerial tubes pushed along the terrace brick , erect tips extending hourly in the growth of the rainy season , whose great leaves turned shield to the spatter of Muchanga 's hose glancing off in a shower of harmless arrows , whose two-hand-span trunks were smooth and grooved in one sculptural sweep down their length , or carved by the drop of each deadleaf-stem with concave Medallions marking the place and building a pattern at once bold and exquisite . Such things would not travel ; they were too big to give away . The evening she was beginning to pack the books , the telephone rang in the study . Chipande  --  and he called her by her name , urgently , commandingly ? " What is this all about ? Is it true , what I hear ? Let me just talk to him ? " " Our friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of it , toward her husband . " But you ca n't leave ! " Chipande shouted clown the phone . " You ca n't go ! I 'm coming round . Now . " She went on packing the legal books while Chipande and her husband were shut up together in the living room . " He cried . You know , he actually cried . " Her husband stood in the doorway , alone . " I know  --  that 's what I 've always liked so much about them , whatever they do . They feel . " The lawyer made a face : there it is , it happened ; hard to believe . " Rushing in here , after nearly a year ! I said , but we have n't seen you , all this time ... he took no notice . Suddenly he starts pressing me to take the university job , raising all sorts of objections , why not this that . And then he really wept , for a moment . " They got on with packing books like builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning they were to leave it was all done ; twenty-one years of life in that house gone quite easily into one van . They were quiet with each other , perhaps out of apprehension of the tedious search of their possessions that would take place at the border ; it was said that if you struck overconscientious or officious freedom fighter patrols they would even make you unload a piano , a refrigerator , or washing machine . She had bought Muchanga a hawker 's license , a pushcart , and stocks of small commodities . Now that many small shops owned by white shopkeepers had disappeared . there was an opportunity for humble itinerant black traders . Muchanga had lost his fear of the town . He was proud of what she had done for him and she knew he saw himself as a rich merchant ; this was the only sort of freedom he understood , after so many years as a servant . But she also knew , and the lawyer , sitting beside her in the car knew she knew , that the shortages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soap and matches and pomade and sunglasses , would soon put him out of business . He promised to come back to the house and look after the plants every week ; and he stood waving , as he had done every year when they set off on holiday . She did not know what to call out as they drove away . The right words would not come again ; whatever they were , she had left them behind . ?
