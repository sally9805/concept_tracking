txt Nick Montoya could n't even scratch a bare living from his five acres of near-barren land outside Pefiasco in the summertime . So each year , when the winter snow began to fly down out of the Sangre de Cristos , Nick packed up his wife and three children and left his land to go work as a day laborer near Ely , Nev . He earned $22 a day in the winters , saving just enough to keep him and his family through the Pefiasco summer without work . But Nick wanted desperately to stay all year round in Pefiasco . That wide spot in the narrow road was his home . But there were no jobs . And he did n't know what to do with his land . The hard Pefiasco winter turned it into frozen turf . He had no tractor to plow and drag it . He had no livestock to graze on it . He did n't know when to plant or what to plant . He seemed consigned to the round of rootlessness he had always known . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Pefiasco community center sponsored by HELP ( Home Education Livelihood Program ) . HELP taught Nick how to farm . Economic winds Conceived by the Council of Churches in New Mexico in the mid-1960 's , HELP has pushed out into 44 communities and helped hundreds of Nick Montoyas ? farmers , weavers , growers , sewers , woodworkers , and traditional back-country tradesmen . It tries to give them just enough know-how and economic lift to stay in the back country and not migrate to the city . Pushed by a dozen religious denominations , HELP also draws $1.2 million a year from the Office of Economic Opportunity and $600,000 from the Ford Foundation . HELP does n't necessarily want the Nick Montoyas to stay down on the farm , but it at least wants them to have the choice . Before they never had a choice . The economic winds drove them off toward the city 's jobs . Small towns in northern New Mexico , like Lumberton , dropped from a population of 750 in 1930 to less than 300 today . Now many of those small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness , are beginning to stir again . Fewer people are having to leave . Ear-to-ear smile The HELP-funded Pefiasco Valley Farmers ' Cooperative loaned Nick a tractor to plow his land three summers ago . Now , near the end of the long Pefiasco winter , he stands outside his cluttered front yard and smiles from ear to ear . His youngsters , who had migrated rootless as their father from schools in Pefiasco to Ely , now know only one school . The rambling tin-roofed house Nick has built by himself billows out wood smoke from its two chimneys . Around him , scratching under the two wrecked cars in his front yard , bob half a dozen of his 35 chickens . Out back he has 13 sheep and seven hogs . And besides the five acres he owns , he is leasing another 14 . He is building a lean-to now to store his cauliflower , and he is averaging $6 a day income from the vegetables he grows . That 's not much , but it makes ends meet . And Nick has n't been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intended beneficiaries , however , fare so well . Slim profits His neighbor , Bernardo Valdez , a fellow member of the Pefiasco cooperative , only cleared a $200 profit from his nine acres last year and $400 the year before . He had leased the land and sowed it with the help of the cooperative . But Bernardo has 11 mouths to feed and 11 bodies to clothe . And he ca n't do it . The only livestock he had , a hog , he killed and butchered just the other day . Bernardo 's case points up a paradox . The churches behind HELP on the one hand try to prop him up economically , but at the same time do little to solve his main misery ? too many mouths to feed and too many bodies to clothe . While the Roman Catholic backing does not object to sending out some literature in family planning , church dogma continues to frown on birth control . And now , even with HELP 's help , Bernardo does n't know how long he can last .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
