WHEN he resigned from the Supreme Court in 1969 to avoid conflicts of interest , Abe Fortas withdrew from public life to spend long hours listening to classical music and to write a book on civil liberties . Last year he quietly resumed the practice of law , specializing in corporate and regulatory matters . In contrast to the Old World elegance of his precourt days at Arnold &; Porter ( where the firm 's partners vetoed his return ) , Fortas ' new Georgetown office sports Danish modern furniture . The man belies the decor : at 60 he seems sadder , his eyes tired and his polished wit dulled . But the shock of his departure from the court has not diminished his deep respect for law . In the first on-the-record interview he has granted since his resignation , Fortas offered TIME 'S Dean Fischer and James Simon these observations : <P> &gt; On free speech and personal liberty : " It 's not worth much of a damn to have First Amendment rights if you 're subjected to arbitrary arrest . People do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to protect the entire population ; instead , they regard these rules as a threat to themselves . It 's reflected in the turmoil in this country , and it was dramatically illustrated by the recent demonstrations in Washington . The police must operate within certain rules . " <P> &gt; On wiretapping : " I have a fear that the marvelous quality of American life-free , rambunctious , ebullient , sometimes irresponsible-may be disappearing . In Joe McCarthy 's day , there was a quiet veto on meaningful conversation . Today we are concerned with not just the suppression of protest , but fear-the fear that we might be bugged or under surveillance . No amount of reassurance that these things are not being misused will counteract that fear . " <P> &gt; On the Warren Court : " Its greatest virtue was that it was a strict constructionist court . Particularly on due process and equal protection , the Warren Court went back to the wording and meaning of the Constitution . " <P> &gt; On Earl Warren : " Few Chief Justices have been leaders . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order deliberately . Warren gave an animating spirit to the court . Under him , the court had quality and regard for basic constitutional values . " <P> &gt; On the Burger Court : " It is likely to hew to the Warren Court line with respect to racial matters , but to retreat from Warren Court principles in criminal procedure and personal liberty . This is not just a product of shifting personnel . For the most part , the great decisions of the Supreme Court are based on two building blocks : the development of the law and the public conception of the law . In the area of race , those two building blocks were there . But in criminal jurisprudence , it 's quite possible that the series of building blocks was not quite complete . There is an element of fragility in the decisions because they were not based on a completed foundation . " <P> &gt; On criticizing the present court : " Some decisions trouble me , but I think it 's gay irresponsibility for someone who has gone off the court to criticize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on the court , you try to avoid irresponsibility . The same should be true when you 're off the court . "
