Rosemary 's Fhrer <P> THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL by IRA LEVIN 312 pages . Random House . $8.95 . <P> Who can forget the grainy documentary film sequence that shows Dr. Josef Mengele greeting new arrivals at Auschwitz ? Handsome as a matinee idol in his uniform , he blithely chooses the men , women and children for genetic experiments . Those not gently nudged aside by his baton go more quickly to their deaths in the gas chamber . <P> The " angel of extermination , " as Anne Frank called Mengele in her diary , was not arrested after the war . He lived openly in Bavaria until 1951 , when pressure to bring him to justice forced his retreat to the havens of Argentina and Paraguay . Only when Israeli agents came hunting did he flee to the cover of a German settlement in the Paraguayan jungle . Presumably he is still there , drinking Chilean Riesling and reminiscing about the Third Reich . <P> Ira Levin has other ideas . In The Boys from Brazil , he pulls 64-year-old Mengele out of shady retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in Rosemary 's Baby , Levin bases his new plot on a perversion of planned parenthood . This time the mumbo jumbo of the occult has been replaced by the gizmos of science fiction . <P> After years in his secret lab , Mengele has perfected the biological techniques necessary to duplicate Adolf Hitler-not once but 94 times . The procedure , known as cloning , is based on scientific fact . Because each cell in an organism contains the genetic material that gives the organism its unique characteristics , it is theoretically possible to grow an entire and identical organism from any one cell . In 1943 Mengele had the foresight to ask the Fhrer for blood and skin samples . <P> The embryonic Adolfs are brought to term in the wombs of compliant Indian women , then sent to Rio and put on the world adoption market . Mengele schemes to place them with families in Europe and North America that most closely resemble the parental environment of the original Hitler . The principal qualification : mothers have to be much younger than the fathers-retired civil servants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . If nature does not take its course , killers are sent to eliminate the old men . Having manipulated both nature and nurture , Mengele hopes that at least one of the 94 boys will grow up with the zeal to re-establish a supreme Aryan order . <P> Challenging this diabolism is Jakov Liebermann , a death-camp survivor who has devoted his postwar life to detecting and exposing unpunished Nazi war criminals . He is obviously modeled on Simon Wiesenthal , the Vienna-based sleuth who has tracked down some 800 Nazis , including Adolf Eichmann . <P> Liebermann 's job is to learn what Mengele is up to and then convince the appropriate people to put a stop to the Hitler baby boom . Author Levin 's job is harder . He must convince his readers that The Boys from Brazil is more than just a sick joke . He can not . Levin 's primitive literary skills aside , the turning of Josef Mengele into a mad scientist from the pages of a 1940s comic book requires more than a suspension of disbelief . It also requires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profit is enough to give evil a bad name . <P> R.Z. Sheppard
