Several other torches were thrown and firemen were called to the scene , but the torches burned out without causing any damage . Hundreds of residents of the ) Forest Hills section of Queensl vowed last night at an emotioni al rally to destroy Mayor Lind-1 say 's political future because he supports a low-income housing ! project for the middle-class neighborhood . At an overflow meeting at the headquarters of a civic association in Forest Hills , the ' Mayor was assailed in speeches land with picket signs . This was followed by a torchlight parade to the site for the proposed housing project , three blocks away , where the irate residents hurled rocks through windows of construction trailers . Fire engines appeared on the scene , but no blazes were started . The police were called as some of the protesters blocked traffic leading to the nearby Long Island Expressway , and on the expressway itself for about 10 minutes . As the crowd pushed forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another to burn down the trailers , Sgt. Vincent Gaeta pleaded with the demonstrators to stop the violence . Some continued to throw rocks , while others shouted : " If , this was Harlem , these trailers would have been burned long ago . " As the demonstrators pressed close to him , the sergeant said : " It 's a mob . This is a mob . I 'm calling for reinforcements . " Ten minutes later , several squad cars with patrolmen pulled up at the scene at 108th Street and Horace Harding Boulevard . By then , the milling crowd  --  which included many middle - aged , ordinarily nonmilitant people  --  had broken into smaller groups . The feeling against Mr. //  - -   - -   - -  - Lindsay emerged at a meeting at the Annadale Civic Association headquarters at 62-32 102d Street . There , signs were displayed : " Lindsay is trying to destroy Queens . Now Queens will destroy Lindsay . " The major attack on the Mayor was made by the president of the Forest Hills Residents Association , Jerry Burbach , who denounced Mr. Lindsay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down With Lindsay ' This was greeted by cheers , applause and shouts of " Down with Lindsay . " Angry residents contended that the project would turn the neighborhood into a slum , in which crime would soar and schools would be ruined . A spokesman for the City , Housing Authority had said earlier that construction would begin next week . But people at the rally last night said that pickets , beginning at 8 A.M. today and for at least three weeks thereafter , would seek to block construction equipment . The project is now under review by George Romney , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . Typical of the comments by residents interviewed in the area , who seem overwhelmingly against the project , were the , following : " It 's the end of Queens , " said Martin J. Hirsch , who wore a button reading " Woodstock Peace and Love . " " I 've seen what 's happened in other parts of the city when they put in such projects . Whites want to be with whites and blacks want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exodus , " said Mrs. Deborah Werber . " I improved myself to move to a neighborhood like this . For what ? " Morris Lampert , an elderly man who has lived for 13 years in this area of many apartment houses and some attractive private homes , where Mayor Lindsay received strong support in both mayoral campaigns , said : " We need it like a hole in the head . Let Mr. Lindsay , instead , of running around the country for President think about the city . I would move out , but where am I going to move ? " Repeatedly , in interviews on the streets near the housing site , residents told how they had moved from sections in the Bronx and in Brooklyn that had deteriorated when welfare clients were moved into those neighborhoods . They scoffed at the promise by Mayor Lindsay that 40 per cent of the apartments in the 840-unit project would be for the elderly , and they predicted that even if the elderly did get the apartments they would be mugged and beaten until they were forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other low-income projects of the city . In almost every instance they stressed that they were not against blacks . They pointed out that blacks lived in their buildings and were fine neighbors . They emphasized that these blacks were middle class . " The project will look beautiful the day before the first tenant moves in , " said Howard Margulis , a delicatessen owner , who is an executive of the Forest Hills Residents Association . The group has been active in the fight to block the ; $29-million project . The 8.5-acre project is scheduled to be built in an area bounded by 108th Street , 62 Drive , Colonial Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard . Steel pilings stick out of the ground where private builders once ' planned to erect an apartment house and abandoned the work after hitting water . A high school girl , Claudia ! Carpenter , one of the few who I expressed approval of the ' project , was immediately condemned by angry mothers and fathers , one of whom waved a finger at her and de-clared : " If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At this point , a policeman on a motor scooter , Patrolman Donald Birch , arrived on the scene , worried about what seemed to be trouble . When he The New York Thnes OPPOSED : Forest Hills residents applauding as a speaker attacked the proposed housing project last night , during an overflow meeting at the headquarters of a local civic group . learned the reason for the excited gathering he said : " For once there 's a crowd and it 's not a stickup . " Many of those interviewed yesterday talked of crime in the area . They mentioned purse-snatching. robberies and said there was a growing fear of going out at night . Young mothers were particularly heated about unruliness in neighborhood schools that has accompanied busing from other areas . They predicted that the housing project would mean that their own children would have to be bused into other areas , adding that they would never tolerate it . " Let 's put the housing in Gracie Square , where the Mayor lives , " said Sid Orenstein . Some of the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have supported the project . " We 'll see what happens to the congregations of those rabbis after the project is up , " said one of the passers-by . " The same thing that happened to their synagogues in Brooklyn . " The Queens Jewish Community Council , which represents 53 member groups in Queens , and has bitterly opposed the project that dates back to 1967 , issued a statement saying : " No problem will be solved by moving a ghetto to Forest Hills , where , in reality , it will not he economically or socially integrated into this neighborhood . It will become another ghetto and the urban blight IIthat our politicians are constantly talking about will continue to spread from this . " In attacking Mayor Lindsay , the organization declared : " Mayor Lindsay has shown he is not interested in the Jewish population of his constituency . It will not be enough for him this year to put a yarmulke on his head and eat a knish ? ' Senator Jacob K. Javits , in a statement from Washington , said that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on review ? as I believe they will ? we should not pass up this opportunity , given proper safeguards and planning , to benefit Forest Hills and the metropolitan area of NeW York .
