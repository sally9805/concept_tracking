txt Letters to the Editor pg . 22 Letters to the Editor Thailand : The Junta 's Helpers To the editor : Tucked away on the back pages of most newspapers ( page 7 of The Times of Nov 1 ) there was a short A.P . report advising readers about five Bell helicopters , unarmed versions ( sic ) of the " Huey " craft used extensively in the Vietnam war , being given to the Thai police at an estimated cost well in excess of $1 million . The release stated further : " The helicopters will probably be used to track down opium caravans and locate crops and heroin factories in Thailand . " It is a pity that too few Americans know about the Thai student uprising on Oct. 14 , 1973 , when Thailand 's right-wing dictator , Thanom Kitticachorn. was forced into exile . The United States shortly thereafter sent more than $150. million in military aid to the junta group that carried out the recent ( Oct. 6 ) bloody coup ? an increase of over $80 million in the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the three Years following Thanom 's overthrow , economic aid to Thailand was cut front $39 million per annum to $17 million . Clearly then , the decrease in economic aid helped create the inflation that came about when fewer goods were on the market . Unemployment , too , was aggravated by making fewer public-works projects available . Thus , should n't it be obvious to all how U.S. aid to the reactionary military elements and economic cutbacks gave the Thai army and police the pretext and means for crushing the recent unrest with unbelievable brutality Arts and the Government To the Editor : Now that we know who the next President of the United States will be , we may well ask Mr. Carter , who has talked about the power of intangible things , to appoint a Secretary of Culture . American arts , especially literature ( there are perhaps one thousand fine poets among us today ) , fine arts and the dance , as well as other fields , have come of age . The triumph of American culture has been achieved by the lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with neither the support of the American people nor that of the American Government . It is time that the people and their Government recognize that the American image was made both appealing and powerful in the eyes of the civilized world not by money and arms , but by American arts . Appointing a Secretary of Culture , with however small an initial budget , would give very-much-needed status to artists of all kinds and show that Americans care about the cultural aspects of civilization . If the small nations can exist promoting peace and prosperity , a great nation must manifest the idea of enlightenment . ALEKSIS RANNIT New Haven , Nov. 3. 1976 ? Lottery : How the Pie Is Cut To the Editor : Two recent letters to The Times ( Oct. 18 and Nov. 1 ) discuss the prize structure of the New York State lottery . Both letters indicate that the writers believe that the average prize for a New York lottery ticket is 60 percent of the price of a ticket . Actually , the average prize for a New York lottery To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Analyzing Joblessness , " serves well to raise the issue of what the unemployment rate means . However , his analysis is both incomplete and skewed . He overlooks a number of factors which , if considered , would increase the present unemployment rate in comparison with 1961 . For example , today 's labor force rs better educated . If the labor force today had the same education as fifteen years ago . Sar Levitan notes , the unemployment rate would be half a point higher . While Tella asserts that lengthened unemployment insurance keeps people in the labor force longer , he ignores the fact that the number of persons whose unemployment insurance has run out is higher than ever . Further , while he says that registration requirements for welfare mothers raise the unemployment rate , he ignores the fact that the welfare rolls have risen , including many who would work if jobs were available . He simply is wrong as to teachers during summer vacations adding to the unemployment rate ; they are not covered by the new Supplemental Unemployment Assistance . when they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when we are now asked to believe that the helicoper contribution was made by the U.S. solely for the purpose of stopping drug traffic ? If this sort of continuing occurrence is obfuscated for the average American reader , the motives , techniques and results are becoming more and more obvious to people around the world . Is there any wonder then why our former friends are beginning to recognize and contest our " Chile destabilization " type of involvement  --  wherever it occurs  --  for the precise objectives intended rather than the genuine moral leadership that our country provided in the past ? A , J. ROSENSTEIN Canaan , Conn. , Nov. 2 , 1976 ticket has been set by law at 40 percent of the price . This means that only 40 percent of the money that is spent on New York lottery tickets is returned to ticket holders in the form of prizes . Forty-five percent of the money goes to the state 's general fund and 15 percent is used for operating expenses and vendors ' fees . ( Asst . Prof. ) DAVID H. VROOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , .1976 ? Postal Time Check To the Editor : As a check on the efficiency of the Postal Service , I suggest that we write the date and time we post a letter under the return address on the envelope . This might expedite handling the mail because we will know how long it takes the post office to deliver a letter . JOHN F. LANDGRAF Caldwell . N. J. , Oct. 25 , 1976 ? On the Beauty of Autumn To the Editor : I would like to express my congratulations and my thanks for two beautiful pieces which have appeared on recent editorial pages : " Autumn Sunlight " Oct. 17 and " Autumn Woodland " Oct. 27 . I have just begun reading The Times to a blind classmate at Syracuse University . We concentrate pretty heavily on straight news , and these poetic gems in the midst of the day 's actualities spark a responsive smile on the part of my friend . I do n't know Jay very well yet , but the warmth generated by reading these pieces facilitates communication for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn I am lucky enough to see . JAMIE BECKETT Syracuse . N. Y. , Oct. 30 , 1976 Further , he ignores the growing number of discouraged , partially employed and underemployed workers . Similarly , he ignores the long-term unemployed , up 50 percent in 1975 compared with 1974 . Nor does he note that . in 1975 one in five persons in the labor force experienced some unemployment . In an apparent effort to present a balanced picture , Professor Tella notes that government job-creation programs have employed people who would otherwise add to the unemployment rate . However , he includes among such programs the college work-study program . which employs students only part-time for part of the year . Indeed , this is illustrative of what appears to be Professor Tella 's message  --  things are not as bad as they are reported . While Professor Tella has done a service in noting some of the inadequacies of the unemployment rate , a fuller exploration shows that rather than overstating the problem , it understates it . WILLIAM LYNCH Jr . Exec . Secretary , National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1976 Interfaith Dialogue To the Editor : As a Roman Catholic engaged in ecumenical and interreligious dialogue I want to express my sorrow about the recent acrimony between Father Andrew Greeley and Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum , as reported in The Times of Oct. 5 , and to contrast my experience with that of Father Greeley . In 1970 Rabbi Tanenbaum invited me to speak to the national meeting of the American ' Jewish Committee , the same forum where Greeley says he came to grief . While strongly supporting the existence of an Israeli state for Jews , I denounced what I perceived to be the evils of the occupation in the post-1967 territories and suggested that its continuance would erode support for Israel and lead to the moral decline of Israel 's high ideals . Then as now , I voiced support for both a secure Israel as the expression of Jewish self-determination and a Palestinian solution which would accord similar self-determination to Arabs . Far from being " stabbed in the back , " I received a courteous , if criti-1 cal , hearing , and my appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinions further . ( Some groups were intellectual too , I believe . ) I have conducted three seminars ? in Israel in cooperation with the American Jewish Committee and Rabbi Tanenbaum , where I brought the uncensored views of a wide variety of people to the attention of the participants . The Jerusalem office of the A.J.C. intervened with Israeli authorities to allow me to investigate conditions in Nablus prison on the occupied West Bank . While sometimes disagreeing with both Rabbi Tanenbaum and the A.J.C. , I have always been impressed by their sincere and courageous efforts to air unpopular questions within the Jewish community and to promote genuine interreligious dialogue . Father Greeley is , of course , right in suggesting that every group has to cope with its own prejudices , but his verbal overkill will retard rather than aid the calm discussion of this and other vital concerns which face us . ( Rev. ) CHARLES ANGELL Associate Director Graymoor Ecumenical Institute Garrison . N. Y .. Oct. 29 , 1976 ? To the Editor : As an aftermath of Andrew Greeley 's June 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reports from Chicago indicate that outraged Jews have endangered the ' funding of the National Opinion Research Center 's Center for the Study ? of American Pluralism , headed ' by Father Greeley , and Greeley 's own position is called into question . Greeley gave an honest , constructive and blunt appraisal of JewishCatholic relations . In return he got clobbered . If he sees some Jews particularly those involved in the profession of dialogue ? as stuffy and self-righteous , so do Jews who stand within Judaism and love their people . If he asks for reciprocity in the Jewish-Catholic relationship , it is because it is honorable and right to ask for fairness . Father Greeley is one of the major social scientists of the day , a man whose contributions to the study . of religions , including Judaism . are fresh and full of insight . I am scandalized and ashamed as a Jew and as an academician that his truth should be repaid by abuse and worse . JACOB NEUSNER Professor of Religious Studies Brown University Providence , R. I. , Nov. 2. 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f wonder how many others have noticed a new kind of proliferation which has been growing every quadrennial election , and which threatens to get completely out of hand the next time we choose a President . I refer to the voter opinion poll proliferation . At least once a week from July to Election Day we are regaled with the results of the latest poll . We learn who would have been elected President had the election been held on any of more than a dozen days between the nominating conventions and the day of election . But that 's not all . We 're told which candidate . has picked up or slipped with which bloc of voters . Knowledgeable analysts solemnly ' inform us that one of the candidates must re-ingratiate himself with the significant group of religious fundamentalists in the senior citizen category whom he had apparently offended in an interview with a magazine for secular teen-agers by his remarks:on Medicare . Since these voters are liberally sprinkled through the suburban areas of the Sunbelt , a " crucial " area , so to speak , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four-point edge he enjoyed before he entered his first primary . And so it goes . Is it really so farfetched to expect , as my wife does , that before long all candidates who lead in the poll completed closest to Election Day will be declared the winners ?
