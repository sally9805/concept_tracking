Recent investigations by the U.S. Geological Survey of our oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico have produced evidence of many serious violations of Interior Department regulations . I believe these violations were knowingly and willfully committed . I believe criminal proceedings against Chevron are warranted and recommend that they be instituted . I believe that the strongest possible action should be taken against the violators . <P> Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel was justly outraged . The recent Gulf of Mexico oil fiasco , during which a cluster of twelve offshore wells owned by Chevron Oil Co. blazed for a month , has caused even greater repercussions than last year 's Santa Barbara debacle . Beyond oil , Louisiana 's largest industries are shrimp and oysters , and the rich Gulf of Mexico beds may have been irreparably damaged by the spill . Scientific tests conducted at Woods Hole , Mass. , last week produced the first solid evidence that oil pollution can disrupt the life cycles of marine creatures . <P> Perplexing Negligence . Hickel got the kind of action he demanded . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful lobby in Washington , a federal grand jury convened in New Orleans last week to investigate Chevron 's offshore operations as well as those of several other prominent oil companies . Among other things , Interior officials charged that Chevron had failed to maintain " storm chokes " ( required by the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Acts ) on 137 of 178 wells in the Gulf area . Chevron was also cited by the Government for 210 violations of offshore drilling requirements . The maximum penalty for each violation : $2,000 a day and up to six months ' imprisonment . <P> Hickel , who has indefinitely suspended all offshore lease sales , is particularly incensed because , he claims , Chevron " willfully and knowingly " violated the various requirements . Chevron 's alleged negligence is as perplexing as it is illegal : the storm chokes , which could have shut off the runaway oil , cost only $800 per well . <P> Besides the increasingly hard line from Hickel 's office , Congress last week approved , by a House vote of 358 to 0 ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong penalties on those responsible for oil pollution of U.S. territorial waters . The bill , which President Nixon quickly signed into law , represents an unprecedented rupture in the congressional tradition of pandering to the oil industry . It calls for unlimited liability in cases of willful negligence , plus liability of $100 per gross ton of oil , up to $14 million , for accidental spills . The latter provision is particularly noteworthy since willful neglect has proved exceed ingly difficult to establish in court . The bill also places strict liability on oil ship pers , whom Hickel terms " the greatest polluters of our waters . "
