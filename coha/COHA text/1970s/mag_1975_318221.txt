One of the most serious threats to the nation 's growing business recovery has been the possibility of a continuing rise in interest rates that would discourage borrowing by businessmen and consumers , weaken the stock market and abort a barely begun revival of the housing industry . Last week , however , a consensus formed among experts that a three-month upswing in credit costs is ending , and that interest rates are expected to hold steady , or even inch down . For example , James J. O'Leary , vice chairman of New York 's United States Trust Co. , now predicts that the bank prime rate on loans to business will hold steady at around its present 8% , at least until the end of this year , rather than rising to 8% as he had once expected . His reason : the Federal Reserve Board " appears to be in the early stages of a moderate easing " of its recent tight-fisted money policies . <P> As always , the Federal Reserve , which believes that it must operate in the deepest secrecy , refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fact feeding a bit more lendable money into the nation 's banking system , inscrutable Chairman Arthur Burns rumbled : " I could n't answer that-I 'm a central banker . " But evidence of a slight loosening of Federal Reserve policy had already surfaced . Little more than a week ago , in an effort to calm jitters in the credit markets caused by the bankruptcy petition of W.T. Grant Co . ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) and New York City 's continuing financial crisis , the board pumped about $800 million into the banking system by buying federal securities . The proceeds were deposited in banks and had the effect of increasing bank reserves , giving the banks more money to lend and weakening upward pressure on interest rates . <P> Lowest Level . Evidence of a more liberal policy came last week from the board 's actions on so-called Federal Funds-that banks lend to each other overnight . The interest rate on such loans is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve 's purchases or sales of Government securities . The board often uses the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will let the rate rise to show a tightening , permit it to fall in order to flash a sign of expansion . At one point last week , the board let the Fed Funds rate fall to 5.875% , the lowest level in two months , before it moved to nudge the rate up again . Last week the rate averaged 6.06% , down from 6.36% the week before . <P> Outside the money markets , these might seem less than earthshaking events . But the prospect of steady interest rates already is heartening . On the stock market , which is hurt by rising interest rates , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.70 last week , to a close of 823.91 . In the bond market , a $200 million offering of 33-year debentures by Michigan Bell Telephone sold briskly at a 9.6% interest rate , a smidgen below the 9.7% rate on a Bell System issue on Sept. 17 . Rates at auctions of three-month Treasury bills , a bellwether of the market for short-term money , have fluctuated between 6% and 6% for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range soon .
