txt The Nation Death Sentences : 700 Await Court 's Verdict WASIMGTON  --  The Supreme Court heard arguments last week for the first time on the constitutionality of capital punishment ? arguments that may determine the fate of the 700 men and women on the nation 's death ! OWL Yew observers will hazard an absolute public prediction that the Court will rule in favor of the death penalty , ending the five-year moratorium on executions in the United States . They hedge because the issue before the Court is a new one  --  a challenge on the Eighth Amendment grounds of " cruel and unusual punishment " brought by two condemned murderers and two condemned rapists  --  and because two new Justices will take part in the decision . But the legal doctrines and the conservatism of the " Nixon " Court make prospects for an abolitionist victory seem unlikely . In any case , it would be no easy task to persuade the Court that capital punishment violates the constitutional stricture against " cruel and unusual punishment . " When the Eighth Amendment was adopted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the 14th Amendment was adopted almost a century later to extend and expand the rights of the Individual , it said only that the taking of life by the Government must be done with due process of law . So the abolitionists have based their case on the argument that the death penalty has become so alien to American thinking that executions are rarely , erratically and discriminatorily imposed  --  and thus are both " cruel " and " unusual . " Proponents replied last week that the Eight* Amendment was intended to outlaw torture , and that modern methods of dispatching condemned persons are humane . If executions have become " unusual , " they added , it Ls because they have been blocked for five years by the present litigation . But what may have been their strongest point was the argument that to strike down capital punishment on the visceral reactions of the Justices would be to arrogate the powers of a " superlegislature " to the Supreme Court , an argument that seemed to strike a responsive chord with the conservative Burger Court . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse ruling by the Court would lead the political system to assert itself , that Congress or the state legislatures would act to prevent a " bloodbath . " This was an example of vintage judicial self-restraint : Where the legislatures can or should act , the Court should stand aside . And , then , too , there was the unspoken realization by those on both sides of the issue that if the Court does remove the barriers to executions , mass slaughter will not necessarily follow . Governors traditionally reduce many death sentences to prison terms , but this review has no far been denied the 700 because of . the litigation . And an adverse . Court ruling at this time will not end all suits . In California , for instance , where 102 persons are awaiting execution , 77 are still appealing their cases through the state courts , and others have Federal court litigation on grounds in addition to the Eighth Amendment one . Only about a dozen prisoners would be immediately eligible for execution , and Gov . Ronald Reagan could carry out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas chamber , probably avoiding an anti-execution backlash that wholesale executions might touch off . The trend of public opinion right now seems to be turning away from the reform spirit that led eight states to abolish or restrict capital punishment during the past decade  --  perhaps because there have been no executions in so long or because of the growing public fear of crime . Polls which showed public opinion about evenly divided on the death penalty in 1965 have since shifted to 51 per cent in favor of executions , 40 per cent against and the rest undecided . Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark , who opposed capital punishment , has been succeeded by John N. Mitchell , who approves it  --  and Frank Rizzo , who was overwhelmingly elected Mayor of Philadelphia , thinks his town should have its own electric chair . So the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund , Inc. , which initiated the campaign that led to last week 's hearing , does not plan to turn to the legislatures  --  the voices of the people ? if its suit fails . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his case is a likely loser , but he has made elaborate plans for such an eventuality . The main thrust will be a series of lawsuits challenging further aspects of capital punishment . One example is the defense fund 's case that led the New Jersey Supreme Court to strike down the state 's capital punishment law last week , on the ground that its structure pressured defendants to plead guilty to avoid execution . If the defendant pleaded " no contest "  --  the equivalent of a guilty plea  --  he could receive no more than a life sentence . Only a defendant who pleaded " not guilty " risked receiving the death penalty . The defense fund lawyers also plan to launch the country 's first organized campaign to win governors ' clemency . They will use psychiatritsts and trial like hearings in an effort to win life terms for all condemned prisoners . One result of all the debate over the " humaneness " of executions is that for the first time since Nevada introduced the gas chamber in 1921 , considerable thought is being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned .
