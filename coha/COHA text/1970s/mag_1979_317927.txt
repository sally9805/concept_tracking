Dose of SALT <P> To the Editors : <P> Pray God that the honorable Senators realize that SALT II May 21 , despite its imperfections , represents a giant step for mankind as an initial move toward trust and disarmament . <P> Michael LaGrone Baytown , Texas <P> I find the SALT II treaty almost as useful as the pre-World War II Munich conference . The U.S. and U.S.S.R. will always make sure there are enough weapons around to destroy the planet . <P> Ed Hershman Chicago <P> Just what the doctor ordered : a dose of SALT II to avoid high blood pressure around the world . <P> Gene Wildman New York City <P> Should we in fact detect cheating by the Soviets , it is our word against theirs . Is n't such a situation more dangerous and liable to bring on a crisis than if we had secured more reliable forms of verification by being more stubborn and shrewd in our negotiations ? Without the possibility of 100% verification , we are the big losers in the deal . <P> Robert P. Sternick Fullerton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history as the savior of the world-and the time was never riper-let him make the boldest move of all : experiments in unilateral disarmament . We ca n't go on forever piling up genocidal weapons . <P> Herbert Meredith Orrell Albuquerque <P> On the Right Tracks <P> The Essay " The Sad State of the Passenger Train " May 21 says it all . Let us hope that before the railroad tracks are replaced with sassafras bushes or asphalt parking lots , we in the boondocks without supersonic transports will stand up and be counted for rail travel . For those who can : fly . For those who ca n't : please give us a choice . <P> Rachel Myers Bedford , Ind . <P> Our country should definitely stop , look and listen once more . <P> Louis D. King Iowa , La . <P> Most people who bemoan the passing of the passenger train have n't been on one in a decade , and would n't use trains no matter how efficient and comfortable they might be .

Janecky St. Paul <P> Antitrust Pros and Cons <P> Your conference on antitrust May 21 mentions that Senator Edward Kennedy is sponsoring legislation to prevent mergers and takeovers because of size . In the next breath he is trumpeting legislation for a monopoly in health insurance . It is time to turn our trustbuster from Massachusetts loose on the Government . <P> Dave Crowther Aurora , Colo . <P> If the trust-dominated media and politicians would stop talking to each other and listen to the enraged public , they would know that social control of basic industry is the wave of the future . <P> J. Quinn Brisben Chicago <P> Unless we uncuff business , America is doomed . Capitalism can not , in the long run , survive in a semicapitalistic state . It is the businessmen , not the politicians , who have raised the American standard of living to its unprecedented level . <P> Gene Domanico Rosedale , N.
