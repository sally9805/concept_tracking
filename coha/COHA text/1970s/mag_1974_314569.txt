For most of its 40 years , the Export-Import Bank has enjoyed a quiet , effective and even profitable existence . Started in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to finance American trade with the Soviet Union , which the U.S. had just recognized , the bank was soon authorized by Congress to grant credits to other countries so that they could buy more U.S. goods and services . By using its $20 billion lending authority to extend credit to countries and companies on which commercial banks would not take a risk , Ex-lm has helped expand U.S. exports . It facilitated a record $10.5 billion sales last year and continued as a rare moneymaker among federal agencies . In fiscal 1973 it collected $140 million in interest and paid its 23rd consecutive dividend , of $50 million , to the Treasury . Yet now this unobtrusive institution has come under hot attack from politicians , labor leaders and others who charge that its liberal lending policies have unduly rewarded rich nations , robbed the U.S. of jobs , and worsened domestic inflation . <P> Congress must decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lending authority , which expires June 30 . There is no doubt that Congress will keep Ex-lm alive , but probably with new limitations on its autonomy . Last week the Senate Banking Committee approved an amendment drafted by Democrats Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson of Washington and Adlai Stevenson III of Illinois that would require Ex-lm to give Congress 30 days ' advance notice of any proposed credit of $50 million or more ; Congress could then veto the loan . Tougher restrictions could be added on the Senate floor . <P> Ex-Im Chairman William J. Casey , formerly head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Under Secretary of State , complains that the Jackson-Stevenson restriction would hinder the bank 's ability to compete in a fast-moving global credit market where time is money . The House has yet to draft an Ex-Im bill , but opposition to the bank 's recent policies is even stronger there than in the Senate . <P> Cheap Credit . Recently , Ex-Im granted a $469 million credit package to finance an $80 million trade center in Moscow and plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built with assistance and hardware from U.S. companies . By 1978 , Ex-Im loans to the Soviets could total $1.4 billion . Senator Stevenson charges that the credits are going to a nation that does not really need the help . " Soviet gross national product , " he points out , " is second only to our own . " <P> Opponents are particularly incensed by the low interest rates on Ex-Im loans . While U.S. corporations have to pay 11% or more interest on borrowings from commercial banks , the Soviets are getting Ex-Im money at 61/2% . Iran is paying around 6% on Ex-Im loans of $877 million to finance such things as oil refineries , airplanes and diesel locomotives-even though , as Scoop Jackson points out , Iran is awash in oil dollars . Casey persuasively defends the rates as competitive with those charged by export-finance agencies in Britain , France , Japan , Canada , Italy and Germany . If the Soviets and Iranians can not get cheap credit from Ex-Im , he says , they will go elsewhere , and U.S. exporters will lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
