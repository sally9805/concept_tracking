In mid-1973 Sweden 's Volvo announced that it would become the first foreign auto manufacturer to build an assembly plant in the U.S.A site had been selected at Chesapeake , Va. , to start production in the spring of 1977 . But with that deadline at hand , Volvo has postponed start-up indefinitely , leaving Volkswagen as the only foreign carmaker with firm plans to assemble in the U.S. , beginning in early 1978 . <P> What went wrong ? The quick answer is that Volvo 's car sales in the U.S. fell from a peak of 60,338 in 1975 to 43,887 last year , a decline of 27.3% . But that drop is only a symptom of a deeper problem that afflicts not only Volvo but all Swedish industry . Essentially , the welfare-state policies of the Swedish government are pushing labor costs so high as to price Swedish products out of the international market . <P> Volvo has also been hurt by a drop in its reputation for quality . Though its sales in Sweden last year hit a record 75,000 , its exports have slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 70% of capacity-and even so , Volvo is running out of space to store unsold cars . <P> Thin Profits . Volvo 's high prices are largely the result of a 40% raise in Swedish labor costs in the past two years . To contain the damage to sales , Volvo has absorbed some of the cost in export markets , rather than pass on the full rise in prices charged to foreign buyers . Result : Volvo 's 1976 profits of $136 million were only 3.7% of sales , v. 10% in 1972 and 1973 . Profits on export sales to North America and Western Europe were a paper-thin 1% . <P> The climb in labor costs is not only the result of pay . An even greater problem is absenteeism , which at Volvo 's Torslanda assembly plant just outside the Gothenburg headquarters runs to 20% daily . That means Volvo in effect has to pay five employees to do the work of four . Some workers are absent an average of 65 days a year each . <P> The reason is a system of sick-pay benefits so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when he himself is ill , a father of three children , for example , by law gets 18 paid sick days to allow him to be at home when one or more of his children is bedridden . Says Volvo President Pehr G. Gyllenhammar : " It is no longer a question of whether individual Swedes can afford to be sick and still receive pay , because this is an obvious right . It is a question of the country 's ability to pay for the level of absenteeism we have reached . " <P> No Answer . Little relief is in sight . <P> Like its Socialist predecessor , the new coalition government of Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin is fully committed to the welfare state . That means keeping unemployment at its present low rate of 1.5% , even if employers must pay workers who show up only sporadically . Volvo has pioneered new ideas to keep workers interested , including a novel assembly line that allows employees to set their own pace ( TIME , Sept. 16 , 1974 ) . That has cut absenteeism in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards outside Sweden . Even shutting down is no answer ; on each of the days that its plants will be idle in early 1977 , Volvo will have to give workers 85% of their normal pay , and unions are clamoring for 100%.
