txt WASHINGTON , March ** F. Burns , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , disclosed to Congress today that the Reserve had already moved to relax somewhat its extremely restrictive monetary policy and to permit a resumption of ' growth in the nation 's money supply . Mr. Burns said it was his ' view that present circum-I stances called for a growth money  --  currency and demand ' deposits ? of at least 2 per : cent , though he disclosed no ' details of exactly what the Re-I serve had decided to aim for in this or other monetary mews- ' ures . Until the last few weel:s , I there had been no growth at , ail in the money supply since last June . Testifying before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , Mr. Burns presented what he called a " cautiously optim- , istic " assessment of the ecoH nomy . After examining individ- ' ual sectors from automobiles to defense spending , he concluded that , " while a sluggish pace of economic activity may con tinue a while longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in th relatively near future . " No Doubt on Point He also concluded that , " while there is little basis fo expecting an end to inflation this year , there is reason to , expect substantial progress in slowing the rate of price in crease . " Mr. Burns 's disclosure that the restrictive monetary policy pursued for a year had been relaxed somewhat followed only a day after President Nixon announced a modest switch in the Government 's fiscal , or budget , policy in the form of a release of $15-billion in construction funds , previously frozen .

" Although he said he was " heartened " by the slower climb of wholesale prices in February , Mr. Burns cautioned that " we obviously can not conclude from the evidence of a single month that a significant further reduction in the rate of price advance is just around the corner .

" Then ' he volunt erered , " if you ask me whether it should apply now , my answer is yes . " In saying as much as he did , Mr. Burns departed from the custom established by his predecessor , William McChesney Martin Jr. , who never dis  --  cussed current monetary policy . Mr. Burns even disclosed , without giving details , that he had " achieved unanimity ? in one of the two meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee over which he had presided but not in the other .

" Under questioning , he said he expected mortgage interest rates to be " a little lower " by the end of this year and " appreciably lower " by 1972 . He also said he expected the prime lending rate of banks to be lower by the end of this year and he added that he hoped it would he reduced " fairly soon .
