FOREIGN KIBITZERS <P> - are horning in with advice to the U.S. President to pull out of Cambodia , pull out of Viet Nam , and so on . <P> Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Wilson is one of these . Prominent British Conservative Enoch Powell is another . French Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann is still another . <P> The correct answer to these gentlemen , we believe , is that the U.S.A. has been the prime factor in winning their countries ' last two major wars for them and does not need their advice as to how to conduct its own wars . <P> AID-TO-THE-ENEMY DAY <P> - Organizers of the manifold demonstrations set for today against further U.S. participation in the Viet Nam War lump them under the title Viet Nam Moratorium Day . <P> We have a better name for it .
