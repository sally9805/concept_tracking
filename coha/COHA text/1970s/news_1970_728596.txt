txt Special to The New York Times PHUOCVINH , South Vietnam , May ** Nixon 's announcement that he intends to begin moving American troops out of Cambodia by midweek and have most of them out by mid-June has startled and bewildered field , commanders of the 10-day-old sweep across the border . Rather than being ahead of schedule in the gigantic sevenfront operation , as the President said , commanders have hastily moved into so much new territory , they say , that they are only now beginning a thorough search of enemy base areas . At his news conference Friday , President Nixon said : " The middle of next week , the first units , American units , will come out . The end of next week , the second group of American units will come out.11 The great majority of all American units will be out by the " second week of June , and all Americans of all kinds , including advisers , will be out . . . by the end of June . " Ground soldiers insist that at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply depots they have already discovered . Only a tiny fraction of the enemy bunkers they have spotted have been searched . Hundreds of trails within these huge complexes have yet to be explored , and hundreds of square miles of dense jungle hideouts have yet to be searched . Yet already , battalion and company commanders say , their men are so spread out in guarding the enemy supplies and in providing security for the operations , that they have been unable to ? search very much new ground . The commanders are faced with the job of removing or destroying what is already the largest haul by far of enemy munitions , supplies and food uncovered in the war . By late today , the tentative count reaching Saigon command headquarters stood at 6,757 rifles ; 1,232 heavy machine guns , mortar tubes , rocket launchers , recoilless rifles and antiaircraft guns ; 865 tons of ammunition ; 1,653 tons of rice ; 12 tons of medical supplies ; 130 trucks , and thousands of other items ranging from radios to mortar cleaning and repair kits . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one high-ranking officer . Just moving that much material out of the cache sites or destroying it is a job requiring either thousands of additional troops or several more weeks than President Nixon has given the troops already there , according to sources here . Resupply helicopters are already reported working overtime simply supplying the troops in Cambodia with food , ammunition and other needs . Engineer units are feverishly trying to open roads from South Vietnam to the cache sites , but in some remote areas h t " There is so much in there that I could n't begin to estimate it , " he went on . " It 's so big it 's swallowed up my men // this is considered impossible in the time remaining . And with monsoon rains already beginning to fall , truck traffic may be halted . When the invasion of the Fishhook area of Cambodia began , commanders of the operation envisioned a very limited foray , perhaps of only three to four days into a relatively small area about 10 miles into Cambodia in a triangle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that the operation would last six to eight weeks , however , commanders here decided to expand their operations in an effort to keep enemy troops off balance and also explore new sanctuaries . As a result , two of the largest cache sites were found ? one known as the City about six miles south of Snout and the other just over the bordei. from Budop , South Vietnam , in Phuoclong Province . Several areas into which ground troops had already Lieut . Col. James Anderson and his First Battalion , Fifth Infantry , First Cavalry division ( Airmobile ) , went into the icomplex known as the City on May 5 . But he said yesterday that his men still did not know the extent of it . Sites Go on and on ' " We have n't even been able to find the boundaries of it , " he said yesterday . " It just goes on and on . " " We 've got the platoons going out but the big problem is that you ca n't afford to just forget about security in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much stuff there that pretty soon , . as you drop off people to secure each new find , you just run out of people . So basically , I 'm going to have to get some more troops in there . headquarters in South Vietnam ) and saying write down everything you see there . "
