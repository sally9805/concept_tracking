MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING <P> by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE <P> Dogberry , the buffoon-cop in Much Ado About Nothing , seems unable to know his duty , let alone do it . Yet through his good offices , villains and sweethearts alike get theirs . So it is with A.J. Antoon , 27 , the Joseph Papp prodigy-proteg who staged That Championship Season . Now Antoon has directed the New York Shakespeare Festival celebration of Much Ado as if unaware of the usual approach to Shakespearean farce , the mannered conceits that often seem aimed at pleasing only the performers and antiquarians . Ignorant of his " duty , " Antoon knows only that the play is a comedy and that audiences like to laugh . He does justice to both . <P> The time and place are not 16th century Messina , but turn-of-the-century America . In both periods , wars can be won with small loss and loves pursued with grand stratagems . Courtship and cozening can unfold while the players dance the maxixe . Antoon and Choreographer Donald Saddler abscond with reality so neatly that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterston is Benedick to the last corpuscle . He brandishes his cigar like a swagger stick . He discovers his love half knowingly , but with astonishment nonetheless , like a child finding the tooth fairy 's silver dollar . Kathleen Widdoes makes Beatrice a proper combination of cold wit and hot blood . When she exclaims , " I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband ! " <P> one understands fully Don Pedro 's instant proposal and wants to shout affection not only for her , but for the entire <P> Company .
