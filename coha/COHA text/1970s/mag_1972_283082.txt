Ever since the 1880s , the clean desert air over El Paso has been smudged black from smokestacks belonging to the American Smelting &; Refining Company . El Pasoans sneezed and coughed , but the belchings seemed a necessary nuisance to most people-and particularly to the plant 's 750 workers , largely Mexicans , who earned their livelihood by smelting copper and lead . <P> Now they are beginning to wonder . Early this month five youngsters who live near the plant had to be hospitalized for severe lead poisoning . They were two to five years old . " Blood samples showed basophilic stippling small purple dots , and some of the children showed lead lines in the gums of their teeth , " says Dr. Bernard Rosenblum , head of the city health unit . <P> Another 54 children also showed high lead content in their blood . " We found some kids with foot drop , a symptom of lead poisoning , " adds Rosenblum . " This occurs when nerves become paralyzed , and the person can not hold his foot up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable and had loss of weight . These can be signs of lead poisoning . " * <P> Last week state and city officials took American Smelting to court , charging that from 1969 to 1971 the plant emitted enormous amounts of lead , cadmium , arsenic and zinc into the air . The suit asks a fine of $1,000,000 . <P> Even worse findings may lie ahead . Dr. Bertram Carnow of the University of Illinois testified at the trial : " The amount of lead I have seen in El Paso is the highest in both the air and the soil that I have ever seen or heard of . " Worried city officials plan a massive examination . " We will be taking blood samples from between 50,000 and 60,000 kids , " says Rosenblum . El Paso Mayor Bert Williams , who has campaigned against American Smelting and has consequently been booed by workers fearful of the plant 's shutting down , is going to Washington to seek federal help . Last week he was visited by the mayor of Jurez , just across the Rio Grande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children on the Mexican side of the river , " said Williams . " The Mexican government plans to start blood tests over there too . " <P> *So is mental retardation . A Houston woman recently won $175,000 in damages from Lead Products Co. on grounds that lead poisoning had caused brain damage in her six children .
