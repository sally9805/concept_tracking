Like many big-city hospitals , Chicago 's St. Frances X. Cabrini Hospital has been declining with the neighborhood . As white middle-class families left their sturdy brick houses for the suburbs , poor black and Spanish-speaking families moved into the residential sections surrounding the hospital . Doctors began to shun the area , partly because of crime , partly because 60% of its residents were on welfare . By 1970 , Cabrini 's hospital beds were only 68% full and the hospital was $1,000,000 in debt . <P> Anxious to replace the doctors who had traditionally served adjacent neighborhoods and referred patients to Cabrini , the hospital board last year tried a unique approach . It bought an abandoned movie theater a few miles from the hospital , also in the ghetto area , refurbished it and added examination and waiting rooms . At the same time the board launched a search for two doctors willing to staff the theater-turned-clinic . Conditions : Cabrini would guarantee salaries of $3,000 per month for each doctor in return for referrals to Cabrini . <P> Two Filipino internists accepted the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , and the doctors now average about 30 patients a day , with ailments that range from a child 's simple cough to stomach cancer . Since the clinic opened , it has referred 196 patients to Cabrini , raising the hospital 's " bed census " by about 5% . " The idea is working , " says Hospital Board Chairman Sister Irma Lunghi . " We 're not saying that this is going to save the hospital , or the community either , but it is a start . " <P> It has also proved a good start for the two clinic doctors . " I did n't think I 'd ever be able to have a practice because I did n't have the money to put it together , " says 30-year-old Henry Carag . Though they charge less than most doctors for their services ( $8 for the first visit , $6 thereafter ) , the two men are beginning to pay their own way . When the clinic opened in May , the hospital was paying each of them a full $3,000-a-month subsidy to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hospital estimates that by next year the doctors will be earning their entire salary from the community . The physicians are motivated by more than their paychecks in working long past the closing hours posted outside the clinic . Says Dr. Antonio Bautista , the second member of the team : " We see people with all kinds of problems , who really need help . We 'll continue on like this as long as our strength holds out . "
