GREAT TOM <P> by T.S . MATTHEWS 219 pages . Harper &; Row . $8.95 . <P> A poet snores through the months of dormancy , then for a moment slips free of neurosis , professional chores , friends , money problems , sexual despair , family clatter and habits of sloth , and writes six lines . Four of these are bad , and as he sinks back into the murk at the bottom of his mind , he scratches them out . In a working lifetime he may only slip free for a very few days of these moments , and may accumulate enough good lines to fill at best a few hundred pages . <P> Then comes a biographer , who begins with the fact of genius . He moves off in exactly the wrong direction because it is the only direction available to him : back to neurosis , profession , friends , money problems , sexual despair and the rest . <P> Why write a biography of a poet at all ? That is no easy question to answer , particularly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lifetime repeatedly said that he did not wish to be the subject of a biography . Because of that reluctance , a great deal of Eliot material is still unavailable . Some of it is sealed up in a time capsule at Princeton , not to be opened until the year 2020 , and some of it awaits permission from Eliot 's widow Valerie , who ever since the poet 's death in 1965 has refused to cooperate with researchers . <P> Despite these limitations , what T.S . Matthews ' unofficial interim biography does , with considerable grace and affection , is bring Eliot back onstage . <P> His portrait is of a tormented , intensely private man who hid his true face as he hid the meanings of his poems . No , Matthews says-clearing away the kind of speculation that even a researcher who means to do honor to his subject must revive and deal with-Eliot was not a homosexual . Yes , he had " a lifelong horror of women , " although Matthews might better have said a horror of sex , since , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps more women than men among the very few people with whom Eliot had close friendships . No , his sickly and neurotic first wife Vivienne was not a drug addict , although she was more or less constantly on medication . <P> Eliot was born in St. Louis in 1888 into a family stiff with tradition . He was raised on rectitude and duty . His books were carefully selected ; the Encyclopaedia Britannica was permitted , but Tom Sawyer was not . At Harvard , Eliot took boxing lessons , fell under the influence of Irving Babbitt , a hard-minded classicist who was one of his professors , and was introduced to the poetry of Jules Laforgue . <P> At Harvard , too , Eliot met Emily Hale , an attractive Brahmin who may have been the most enduring love of his life . More than a thousand letters to her from England , to which Eliot migrated in 1914 , form the most important part of the material locked up at Princeton . <P> That Eliot kept Emily at arm 's length for five decades does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They met rarely , but Matthews is satisfied that Emily is the Aunt Agatha of Family Reunion and , more important , half of the " we " in the haunting passage at the beginning of Burnt Norton : <P> Footfalls echo in the memory <P> Down the passage which we did not take <P> Towards the door we never opened <P> Into the rose garden ...
