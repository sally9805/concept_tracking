Gold . His father was eighty-two . Among Gold 's childhood memories was the lucid recollection that Sid had lost him deliberatelyin Coney Island one summer day on Surf Avenue near Steeplechase in order to go running after girls , and that one of his older sisters , Rose , or perhaps Esther or Ida , had come to the police station to bring him back home . Gold 's intelligence of that occurrence had never ceased to pain him . Gold 's last class of the week ended after lunch on Friday . Educationwas one of the several fields of knowledge in which he was considered an expert by people who did not know better . Gold had learned from experience that he himself took no pleasure in going away weekends and that most college students did , and he always scheduled at least one class for Friday afternoon in order to keep enrollment low . Normally it was not until the latter half of a course that Gold lost interest in his subject matter and starting disliking his students . This term it was happening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus to the small apartment in midtown Manhattan that he called a studio to see if any messages had come from old girl friends or potential new ones . There was a letter from his earliest girl friend saying she might come into the city again for a day next month and hoped to see him for lunch , which was okay with Gold , who would arrange for sandwiches and coffee to be sent up . Whiskey was already there . From the doorman he picked up a manila envelope addressed to Dr. Bruce Gold and knew it was a late written assignment from an apprehensive student . The weight saddened him ; the manuscript was thick , and he would have to read it . He telephoned Belle to see what time they were leaving . They rode by taxi to Brooklyn from their apartment on the West Side of Manhattan in the tail end of the evening rush hour , Belle quiet , Gold bored . A foggy darkness was falling over the river . Belle carried in her lap in a paper shopping bag the heavy potato kugel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like you wish you were somewhere else , " she advised without turning her head . " Try not to start any fights with Sid . Try to talk at least a little hit to Victor , Irv , Milt , and Max . Remember to kiss Harriet . "  | " I always say hello . Sid starts fights with me . " " All he does is talk . He does n't even talk to you . " " He talks to steam me up . " " I 'll try to interrupt . " Gold slid his tongue up into a front portion of his cheek and tried to concentrate all his ill feelings upon the book about Henry Kissingerhe had been planning for almost a year . The subject was not sufficiently magnetic , and as the taxi emerged from the tunnel into Brooklyn , his thoughts returned to the dismal tumult that lay ahead . He felt ghastly . Everyone else would enjoy it . Family parties had turned for him into grueling and monotonous tests of fealty to which he submitted with sorrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be nobody there he wanted to see . Conversation , for him , would be impossible . He no longer liked his father or brother , if indeed he ever had . He did occasionally feel some gratitude and pity toward his four older sisters , but the locus and depth of these affections varied with his different memories of which had been kindest to him after the death of their mother and in the years before . All knew he had some fame as a writer and could not figure out why . Gold 's distaste for family dinners , his aversion , in fact , toward all forms of domestic sentiment , stretched back distantly at least until the time of his graduation from high school and his moving into Manhattan to attend Columbia College . He was pleased to be entering so prestigious a university and vastly relieved at escaping a large family of five sisters and one brother in which all his life he had felt both suffocated and unappreciated . " I was going to quit college and fight in Israel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love , " but I had this scholarship to Columbia . " Gold had not once thought of quitting college or fighting in Israel . And he did not go to Columbia on a scholarship but on money provided by his father , most of which , he understood now , must have been channeled through the old man 's irresponsible hands from Ski and three of his older sisters . Muriel , the fourth , hadp22never been known to part happily with a dollar for anyone but herself or her two daughters . Another sister , Joannie , lived in California . Mercifully , she was younger . Joannie had charged away from home in delinquency a long time before in hopes of succeeding as a model or movie actressand was married now to an overbearing Los Angeles businessmanwho disliked coming East and disdained everybody in the family but Gold . Several times a year she flew to New York alone to see just the ones she wanted to . Gold had found himself the center of family attention ever since bringing home his first faultless report card , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closest to him in age and aimed her bad temper these days mostly at Ida , was nasty to him also even then . Ida , officious , was the sister who would impress upon Gold his need to do better in school , although what he did was always perfect . There were times now Gold thought he might go mad from the drenching reverence and affection that still poured over him from Rose and Esther , his two eldest sisters . Whatever expectationshe had aroused , he had apparently fulfilled . They shimmered with love whenever they looked at him , and he wished they would stop . While he was in college , Rose would frequently mail or give him a twenty-dollar bill , he remembered , and so would Esther . Like Sid , both had gone to work after high school as soon as they could find jobs . Ida was able to go to college and become a schoolteacher . Ida handed him fives , always with strict instructions about how the money was to be spent . Rose and Ida still worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired her during the Depression , Ida in the public-school system . Ida was assistant principal now in an elementary school , and she was fighting for her sanity against militant blacks and Hispanics who wanted all Jews gone , and said so in just those words . Esther had been widowed two years before . Much of her hair fell out almost overnight , and the rest turned white . She talked vaguely at times of finding employmentagain as a bookkeeper . But she was fifty-seven , and too timid to try . Muriel , whose husband , Victor , did well in wholesale beef and veal , was a distinct contrast to the others . She dyed her hair black to camouflage the gray and played poker with friendsp23who also enjoyed outings to the racetrack . A chain smoker with a hoarse voice and a tough manner , Muriel was constantly spilling cigarette ashes that Ida , with her zeal for order , would brush away with scolding , high-minded comments of disparagement , even in Muriel 's own house . Between Sid , the firstborn , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these four older sisters who often seemed like four hundred and fifty when they flocked around him with their questions , censures , solicitudes , and advice . Ida cautioned him to chew his food slowly . Rose telephoned to warn that it was icy outside . He thought of them all as outdated , naive , and virtually oblivious to the very real proximity of sinfulness and evil . Except for Sid , Gold recalled , and therefore Harriet , his wife . Sid in nimbleryears had been discovered one time in San Francisco when he was supposed to be in San Diego on business , in Acapulco one time when he was supposed to be in San Francisco , and on a houseboat in Miami when he was registered at a hotel in Puerto Rico . Once possessed of the means , Sid had learned how to ease his way effortlessly through hotels . Now he went out of town only with Harriet on brief vacations or to visit his father in Florida in the winter . Sid was a large , genial , heavyset man with soft flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their father , although the latter was short and chubby , with bushy white hair that stood almost straight up like the hair of a figure in a comic strip receiving a powerful charge of electricity . Gold was lean , tense , and dark , with vivid shadows around his eyes in a crabby , nervous face women found dynamic and sexy . Sid was easing compliantly into an antiquated generation , wearing plain gray or blue suits with white shirts and wide blue or maroon suspenders , whereas their demanding , autocratic old four-flusher of a father , the retired tailor Julius Gold , was dressingmore and more each year like a debonair Hollywood mogul , favoring cashmere polo shirts and suave blazers . Inexplicably , Sid seemed to be growing more fond of their father . Far back , Gold remembered , Sid had run away from home and stayed away a whole summer to escape the old man 's domineering eccentricities and cantankerous boasting . Gold and Belle were nearly the last to arrive at Ida 's apartmentp24on Ocean Parkway ; Muriel and Victor entered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convivial in his role as host . He was a dentist with offices above a paint store on Kings Highway . Already , Gold was having difficulty distinguishing one person from the next . It was a way of coping . He shook hands quickly with Irv , Victor , Sid , Milt , Max , and his father , differentiating between them only in the accumulating letdown he felt with each . Max , Rose 's husband , who was slightly diabetic , sipped at a glass of club soda squeamishly . The other men , along with Muriel , drank whiskey , the rest of the women , soft drinks . Belle had vanishedinto the kitchen to oversee the unpacking of her potato kugel and be of assistance to Ida , who probably was simultaneously shooing her away and giving her things to do , and reprehending her in the same breath for failing to do them swiftly enough . Everybodythere , including his father , had at least one child who was a source of heartache . Gold took bourbon from Iry and began kissing the cheeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His stepmotherauthorized his approach by bobbing her head above her knitting and inclining her face . Gold bent to her with both forearms at the ready , fearing she might run him through the neck with one of her knitting needles . Gold 's stepmother , who was from an old Southern Jewish family with branches in Richmond and Charleston , habitually made things difficult for him in a variety of peculiar ways . Frequently when he spoke to her she did not answer at all . Other times she said , " Do n't talk to me . " When he did n't talk to her , his father moved up beside him with a hard nudge and directed , " Go talk to her . You too good ? " She was always knitting thick white wool . When he complimentedher once on her knitting , she informed him with a flounce that she was crocheting . When he inquired next time how her crocheting was going she answered , " I do n't crochet . I knit . " Often she called him to her side just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and said , " Cackle , cackle . " He had no idea what to reply . Gold 's stepmother was knitting an endless strip of something bulky that was too narrow to be a shawl and too wide and uni/formly straight to be anything else . It was around six inches broad and conceivably thousands of miles long , for she had been working on that same strip of knitting even before her marriage to his father many years before . Gold had a swimming vision of that loosely woven strip of material flowing out the bottom of her straw bag to the residence Sid found for his father and her each summer in Brooklyn in Manhattan Beach and from there all the way down the coastline to Florida and into unmeasured regions beyond . She never wanted for wool or for depth inside her straw bag into which the finished product could fall . The yarn came twitching up through one end of the opening in her bag , and the manufactured product , whatever it was , descended , perhaps for eternity , into the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her one time out of curiositythat could no longer be borne in silence . " You 'll see , " she replied mysteriously . He consulted his father . " Pa , what 's she making ? " " Mind your own business . " " I was only asking . " " Do n't ask personal questions . " " Rose , what 's she knitting ? " he asked his sister . " Wool , " Belle answered . " Belle , I know that . But what 's she doing with it ? " " Knitting , " said Esther . Gold 's stepmother was knitting knitting , and she was knitting it endlessly . Now she asked , " Do you like my wool ? " " Pardon ? " " Do you like my wool ? " " Of course , " he replied . " You never say so , " she pouted . " I like your wool , " said Gold , retreating in confusion to a leather armchair near the doorway . " He told me he likes my wool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max . But I think he 's trying to pull it over my eyes . " " How was your trip ? " his sister Esther asked dotingly . " Fine . " " Where were you ? " said Rose.  | " Wilmington . " " Where ? " asked Ida , passing with a serving tray . " Washington , " said Rose . " Wilmington ? " " Wilmington . " " Washington . " " Washington ? " " Wilmington , " he corrected them all . " In Delaware . " " Oh , " said Rose , and looked crestfallen . " How was your trip ? " asked Ida , passing back . Gold was going mad . " He said it was fine , " answered Esther before Rose could reply , and drifted toward a coffee table on which were platters holding loaves of chopped liver and chopped eggs and onions under attack by small knives spreading each or both onto round crackers or small sections of rye bread or very black pumpernickel . " Meet any pretty girls there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muriel was ever under obligation to be up-todate . " Not this time , " Gold answered , with the required grin . Muriel glowed . Iry chuckled and Victor , Muriel 's husband , looked embarrassed . Rose stared from face to face intently . Gold suspected that she had grown hard of hearing , and perhaps did not know . Her husband , Max , a postal worker , was slurring his words of late , and Gold wondered if anyone but himself had noticed . Esther returned with a plate prepared for him , and a saltshaker aloft in her other hand . " I brought these all for you , " she announced in her trembling voice . " And your own saltshaker . " Gold cringed . " Do n't spoil him , " Muriel joked gruffly , spilling ashes onto her bosom from a cigarette hanging from her mouth . The women in Gold 's family believed he liked his food excessivelysalted . " Do n't salt it until you taste it , " Ida yelled from across the room . " I already seasoned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was holding . Other peoples fingers plucked the remaining pieces from hisp27plate . Esther and Rose each brought him more . Sid watched with amusement . So many fucking faces , Gold thought . So many people . And all of them strange . Even Belle , these days . And especiallyhis stepmother . He would never forget his first encounter with his stepmother . Sid had flown to Florida for the wedding and returned with her and his father for a reception at his home in Great Neck . There was an uncomfortable silence after the introductions when no one seemed sure what to say next . Gold stepped forward with a gallant try at putting everyone at ease . " And what , " he said in his most courtly manner , " would you like us to call you ? " " I would like you to treat me as my own children do , " Gussie Gold replied with graciousness equal to his own . " I would like to think of you all as my very own children . Please call me Mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welcome to the family . " " I 'm not your mother , " she snapped . Gold was the only one who laughed . Perhaps the others had perceived immediately what he had missed . She was insane.  |p28GOLDS  stepmother had been brought up never to be seen eating in public , and she entered the dining room as always with her knitting needles and her straw tote bag . Fourteen adults were grouped elbow to elbow at a table designed for ten . Gold knew that his was not the only leg blocked by supporting braces underneath . I have been to more meals like this than I can bear to remember , Gold lamented secretly . Ida 's daughter was out for the evening , her son was away at college . " I can see on the table , " Sid announced with such generalized amiability that Gold 's muscles all bunched reflexively in anticipation of some barbed danger nearby , " Belle 's potato kugel , Esther 's noodle pudding , Muriel 's potato salad , and Rose 's . . . " He faltered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blushing . " Rose 's matzoh balls . " " And my wool , " said Gold 's stepmother . " And your wool . " " Do you like my wool ? " She seemed coquettishly dependent on Sid 's good opinion . " It 's the tastiest wool in the whole world , I bet . " " He does n't like it , " she said with a glance at Gold . " I like it , " Gold apologized weakly . " He never tells me he likes it . " " I like your wool . " " I was not talking to you , " she said.  |p29Victor  laughed more loudly than the others . Victor was convinced that Gold and Iry both looked down upon him . This was true , but Gold bore him no unkind feelings . Victor , red of face and sturdy as a bull , was sweet to Muriel and liked Belle , and could always be relied on to send one of his meat trucks and some laborerswhen anything heavy was to be transported . His posture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be holding himself erect at enormous physical cost . Gold was positive he would be the first among them to be felled by a heart attack . " I made a honey cake , " Harriet put in poutingly . " I 'm sure I ruined it . I was going to make a Jell-O mold but I know you all must be sick of it . " " And Harriet 's honey cake . " " Much starch , " said Max , who , in addition to having diabetes , was susceptible to certain circulatory imbalances . Wearing a worriedfrown , Max declined everything but some chicken wings , a slice of pot roast , from which he separated the fat , and string beans . Esther was served by Milt , a suitor courting her in almost wordlesspatience . She waited stiffly without looking at him . Milt , the older brother of her deceased husband 's business partner , was a careful , respectful man who talked little in the presence of the family . Milt was past sixty-five , older than Sid , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he flicked a second spoonful of Esther 's noodle pudding onto her plate , and then a spoonful onto his own . Esther thanked him with a nervous smile . There were platters of meatballs and stuffed derma on the table , too , and a deep , wide bowl of potatoes mashed with chicken fat and fried onions that Gold could have eaten up all by himself . Ida asked Gold , " What 's new ? " " Nothing . " " He 's writing a book , " said Belle . " Really ' ? " said Rose . " Another hook ? " scoffed his father . " ' I'hat 's nice , " said Esther . " Yes , " said Belle.  | " What 's it about ? " Muriel asked Gold . " It 's about the Jewish experience , " said Belle . " That 's nice , " said Ida . " About what ? " demanded his father . " About the Jewish experience , " answered Sid , and then called across the table to Gold . " Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whose Jewish experience ? " " I have n't decided yet . " " He 's writing some articles too , " said Belle . " Most of it is going to be very general , " Gold added with perceptiblereluctance . " What 's it mean ? " Gold 's father wanted to be told right then . " It 's a book about being Jewish , " said Belle . Gold 's father snorted . " What does he know about being Jewish ? " he roared . " He was n't even born in Europe . " " It 's about being Jewish in America , " said Belle . Gold 's father was fazed only a second . " He do n't know so muchabout that either . I been Jewish in America longer than him too . " " They 're paying him money , " Belle argued persistently . Goldwished she would stop . " How much you getting ? " demanded Gold 's father . " A lot , " said Belle . " How much ? A lot to him maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You said it , Pop . " " How much you getting ? " " Twenty thousand dollars , " said Belle . The amount , Gold could see , made a stunning impact , especially on his father , who looked unaffectedly disappointed . Gold himself would have deferred naming a figure . It must seem a fortune to Max and Rose and Esther , and even , perhaps , to Victor and Irv . They would see only a windfall , and forget the work . " That is nice , " said Rose . " That ai n't so much , " Gold 's father grumbled dejectedly . " I made more than that in my time . " And lost more too , Gold thought.  | " Some people write books for the movies and make much more , " Harriet observed in a disheartened way , while Sid chuckledsoftly . Gold opened his mouth to retaliate when Belle said , " Well , that 's only a start . And five thousand of that is for research . It is n't even charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Esther quickly , eager to come to Gold 's support . " I bet that 's very nice . " " What does that mean ? " asked Sid seriously . " It 's hard to explain , " said Belle . " No , it is n't . " " That 's what you told me . " " You would n't listen when I tried . " " Do n't fight , " Harriet flittered in quickly with malice . " It means , " Gold said , addressing himself mainly to Sid and Irv , " that five thousand is charged off as a publishing expense instead of to me , even if I do n't spend it . I can make that much more in royalties from book sales . " " Is n't that what I said ? " said Belle . " That sounds like a very good provision , " Esther 's elderly beau , Milt , observed ever so diffidently , and Gold remembered he was an accountant and would understand too . " Bruce , " Iry ventured , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental practice had ceased growing , Iry had developed a tic in his right cheek that often gave him the appearance of smiling inexplicably . " You are n't going to write about any of us , are you ? " " No , of course not , " Gold responded . " Why would I do anything like that ? " A wave of relief went around the table . Then all faces fell . " Why not ? " demanded his father . " Ai n't we good enough ? " Gold 's voice still tended to weaken in argument with the old man . " It 's not that kind of book . " " No ? " bellowed his father , rearing up an inch or so and stabbing at Gold an index finger that curved like a talon . " Well , I 've got news for you , smart guy . You ai n't gon na do it so hot without me . It 's what I told you then , and what I told you now . It 's what I toldp32you from the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He changed in a second from choleric belligerence to serene self-confidenceand sat back with his head cocked to the side . " Good , Sid ? " he asked , turning and looking up . " You said it , Pop . " Julius Gold allowed his eyelids to lower in a look of narcissistic contentment . Those two bastards , Gold told himself , reaching with misplaced hostility for the bowl of mashed potatoes and onions to ladle himselfout another large helping . And they never even liked each other . " Did you ever hear from the White House again ? " asked his sister Rose , beaming . " No , " said Belle , before Gold could reply , and Harriet looked pleased . " But he heard from them twice , " said Esther . " He got two phone calls . " " It was n't really the White House , " Gold corrected . " It was from a friend I went through graduate school with who works in the White House . " " That 's the same thing , " said Ida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? " " I do n't know where he was when he made the phone call . " Gold 's tone was faintly sarcastic . " In the White House , " said Belle , with no change of expression . " Ralph Newsome . " " Thanks , " said Gold . " There was some chance I might forget his name . " " I never heard of him , " said Harriet . " Well , he 's on the President 's staff , " said Muriel , and turned to Gold . " Is n't he ? " Gold plunged his face into his plate and was silent . " I went past the White House once when I was a sweet and very pretty little girl up from Richmond , " Gold 's stepmother recalled . " It looked dirty . " " But he said he liked your hook , did n't he ? " Esther recalled . " Not my book , " Gold explained uncomfortably.  | " His review of the President 's book , " said Belle . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose . " He did , " said Belle . " They offered him a job . " " The President ' ? " asked Ida . " They did not , " said Gold irately . " Not the President . I was only asked if I 'd ever given any thought to working in Washington . That 's all . " " That sounds like a job to me , " said Irv . " You see ? " said Belle . " What 'd you say ? " asked Max eagerly . " He said he would think about it , " said Belle . " I told you not to tell them . " " I do n't care , " Belle answered . " They 're your family . You said you 'd probably take it if the job was a good one . " " You said you would n't go , " said Gold . " I wo n't , " said Belle . " Twenty thousand ?

The food ! In my mouth to ashes the food is turning ! It has been this way with my father almost all my life . From the beginning , Gold ruminated now .

It 's not what you know . It 's who you know . " Some father ! If I said wet , he 'd say dry . When I said dry , he said wet . If I said black , he said white .

It was no secret to anyone that his father considered Gold a schmuck . It would be unfair to say his father was disappointed in him , for he had always considered Gold a schmuck . " From the beginning , " his father showed off again with invertedp34familial pride , as though Gold were elsewhere , " I knew he would never amount to much . And was I right ? It 's a good thing his mother never lived to see the day he was born . " " Pop , " Sid corrected him tactfully . " Bruce was already in high school when Mom died . " " And a finer woman never lived , " responded Gold 's father , noddingfor a moment in bewitched recollection , then glaring at Gold vindictively as though her death at forty-nine had been his fault . " Or died , " he added faintly . Once when Gold was visiting in Florida , his father drew him across a street just to meet some friends and introduced him by saying , " This is my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His father 's lasting appraisal of Gold  --  as of almost every other human in the world , including Sid  --  was that he lacked business sense . Despite his father 's unbroken record of failure in more occupationsand business ventures than Gold knew about , he judged himself a model of splendid achievements and rare acumen , and he never shrank from presenting himself as a shrewd observer of everyone else 's affairs , including those of Sid and General Motors . One of his more penetrating entrepreneurial judgments this year about American Telephone and Telegraph was that " they got no talent in the front office . " " They 're big , all right , " said Julius Gold , " but they do n't know what to do . If I owned all those telephones , oh boy  --  no business would run without me . " His visit to New York this year , ostensibly for dental work , had commenced in May . A staunchly irreligious man , he now seemed oddly determined to remain through all the Jewish holidays , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " He must be reading the fucking Talmud , " Gold had grumbled to Belle when his father cited Shmini Atzereth . Belle pretended not to hear . " Or else he 's making them up . " In Harriet , Gold found a kindred antipathy that surpassed his own . " What 's the matter ? " she had muttered snidely the week of her father-in-law 's arrival . " They have no dentists in Miami ? " It was a fragile and temporary alliance , . Gold knew , for Harrietp35had been methodically putting distance between herself and the family for some time , as though in thrifty preparation for some clear and farsighted eventuality . Harriet had a widowed mother and an older unmarried sister to help support . Gold 's father was five feet two and subject to unexpected attacks of wisdom . " Make money ! " he might shout suddenly , apropos of nothing , and his stepmother would add liturgically , " You should all listen to your father . " " Make money ! " he shouted suddenly now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the only good thing I ever learned from the Christians , " he continued with the same volatile fervor .

They ca n't even swim . And that 's it . Fartig . " " You should listen to your father more . " It was on Gold that the reprimanding gaze of his stepmother rested last , longest , and most severely . " And what does he want me to do ? " " Whatever he does , " answered his father , " is wrong . One thing , " he said , " one thing I always taught my children , " he went on , as though addressing somebody else 's , " was not the value of a dollar , but the value of a thousand dollars , ten thousand .

The upshot is , that when I get old "  --  Gold could no longer believe his ears as he heard this preposterous braggart of eighty-two declaiming  --  " when I get old , nobody will ever have to support me but you children . " Gold , his temper rising , felt no compunction about lashing back . " Well , I do n't like to boast , " he replied roughly , " but when I was with the Foundation seven years ago  --  " " You ai n't with them any more ! " his father cut him short . Gold surrendered with a shudder and pretended to search hisp36plate as Rose , Muriel , and all the brothers-in-law clapped in delight and Esther and Ida rocked with laughter . Gold had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurl hats into the air . His father again sat back slowly with that smile of self-enchantment and let his eyes fall closed . Gold was constrained to smile . He would not want anyone to guess how truly crushed he felt . And then , Sid spoke . " Behold a child , " Sid intoned rabbinically without warning , as though musing aloud upon a slice of Esther 's stuffed intestine held on a fork halfway between his plate and his mouth , and Gold felt his spirits sink further , " by nature 's kindly law , pleased by a rattle , tickled by a straw . " Gold saw in a flash that he was totally ruined . It was check , mate , match , and defeat from the opening move . He was caught , whether he took the bait or declined , and he could only marvel in dejection as the rest of the stratagem unfolded around him as symmetricallyand harmoniously as ripples in water . The others were struck with wonder by Sid 's eloquence and pantheistic wisdom . " That sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " said Max . " It 's nice , " said Esther . " Is n't it ? " " Yes , " Rose agreed . " Beautiful . " " See how smart my first son is ? " said Gold 's father . " You should listen to your older brother more , " said Gold 's stepmother , and aimed the point of her knitting needle at Gold 's eyes " It really is beautiful , " Ida assented reverently . Ida , the shrewishschoolteacher , was considered the intelligent one ; Gold , the college professor , was a novelty . Ida looked Gold fully in the face . " Is n't it , Bruce ? " There was no escape . " Yes , " said Belle . Gold was trapped two , three , four , maybe five or six ways . If he mentioned Alexander Pope , he would be parading his knowledge . If he did n't , Sid would , unmasking him as an ignoramus . If he corrected the prepositional errors , he would appear pedantic , quiff/relsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be insulting to Ida , who , with the others , was awaiting some reply . It was no fair way , he sulked , to treat a middle-aged , Phi Beta Kappa , cum laude graduate of Columbia who was a doctor of philosophy and had recently been honored with praise from the White House and the promise of consideration for a high-level position . Oh , Sid , you fucking cocksucker , lamented the doctor of philosophy and prospectivegovernmental appointee . You nailed me again . " Pope , " he decided at length to mumble unwillingly , keeping his face steadfastly down toward his portion of Ida 's meatballs . " What ? " snapped his father . " He said Pope , ' " Sid informed him congenially . " What 's it mean ? " " It 's by Alexander Pope , " Gold asserted loudly . " Not by Sid . " " See how smart our kid brother is ? " Sid announced , chewing contentedly . " He did n't say it was by him , " Harriet pointed out nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is n't it just as beautiful anyway ? " Ida reasoned with him pedagogically . " Yes , " said Belle . " Is it any less beautiful because it 's by Alexander Pope and not by Sid ? " asked Irv . Belle shook her head firmly , as did Victor , Milt , and Max . Gold found them all abhorrent . " The implication was there , " he exclaimed sullenly . " And the prepositions are wrong . " " Brucie , Brucie , Brucie , " entreated Sid generously , the essence of tolerance and reasonableness . " Are you going to be sore at me just because of a couple of prepositions ? " There was a murmurous shaking of heads . " We 'll make them right if you 're going to be so finicky . " " Sid , you 're fucking me over again ! " Gold shouted . " Are n't you ? " The next few moments were exciting . The women averted their eyes , and Victor , who did not like had language ever in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper in check , and straightened menacingly . " then Gold 's father jumped to his feetp38with an incredulous shriek . " He said fuck ? " His voice ascended to such shrillness that he sounded like a chicken in a frenzy . " Fuck , he said ? I 'll kill him ! I 'll break his bones ! Someone walk me over to him . " " All of you leave Bruce alone , " Ida ordered sternly , restoring order . " This is my house , and I wo n't permit any fighting . " " That 's right , " entreated Rose , a large , kindly woman with a saddle of freckles across her nose . " Bruce is probably still very tired . " " From his trip to Washington , " said Esther . " Wilmington , " said Belle . Sid , licking his lips with a look of triumph , reached with his fingers for a second piece of Harriet 's honey cake . IN THE cab going home , Gold had heartburn and a headache . He could remember meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , pointing the lethal scepter of his finger at whatever he wanted passed to him , and everyone else would hastento ferry everything in that area to him . " Not that ! That ! " he would roar . He would not lower himself to specify , and the challengewas further complicated by the fact that he was mildly cross-eyed . Gold 's father would toss cups , saucers , plates , and serving bowls , empty or full , from the table to the floor if he spied a chip or a hairline crack in any of the porcelain . " I do n't eat from broken china , " he would proclaim like an affronted monarch . Gold could remember his mother and sisters inspecting all the dishes beforehand to segregate those defective ones that must never come before his scrutiny . " The thing is , " Gold recalled in a manner quietly morose , " they used to hate each other . Sid ran away from home once because he could n't take him any more . He was still in high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe Sid hated him . " " I 'll have to ask Rose . Now Sid coddles him like they 've always been pals . You interrupt me a lot , do n't you ? " Gold accused , slouching in a corner of the taxi with his face drooping on his hand . " I do n't interrupt you at all . " There was stubbornness in Ilelle'smanner , never defiance . but a stolid , homespun refusal to givep39more ground , regardless of cost . " You told me you do n't like to be interrupted , so I never interrupt you . " " Then you disagree with me . " " How can I disagree with you , " Belle wondered evenly , " if I 'm the one who says it first ? " " You answer questions for me . " " What 's the difference who gives the answer ? " " Sometimes your answers contradict mine . " " Ca n't I contradict you ? " Belle asked . " No . " " Never ? " " No . " Gold spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shrug . " And I 'm not going to see them all at dinner again , maybe for-ever . " " For three weeks , " said Belle . " They 're coming to our house . I invited them . You said you 'd be home . " " Call it off , " he directed . " Do n't come , " she answered . " It 's Rose 's birthday . And I 'm making her a surprise party . " " At sixty ? " His stress of surprise was edged with ridicule . If Belle answered he did n't hear . There was distance between them now that neither made attempt to deny . He was thankful she did not force him to talk about it . Belle was a pudgy woman nearly his own age , and she seemed smaller and rounder as she sat huggingon her lap the paper shopping bag with the empty Pyrex kugel pan inside , her head up straight in a matter-of-fact way that seemed to be saying , " I know also that I 'm getting old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to make you happy any more . I do n't like it either . Do what you want . " Gold stared across the river at the house lights in New Jersey and was glad he had never had to live there . Soon , he reflected peacefully , he might be free of Belle , for he had learned something more from Ralph that could improve his own situation : it was not mandatory that a husband wait until the youngest child moved off to college before he left his wife . Buoyed by the encouraging prospect of an early separation fromp40Belle , he allowed his imagination to float in joyous expectance to the secret project he had no intention of mentioning this early to Pomoroy or Lieberman . Another book . Now that he had finally abandoned his novel , he would be that much quicker to start . Kissinger . How he loved and resented that hissing name . Even apart from his jealousy , which was formidable , Gold had hated Henry Kissinger from the moment of his emergence as a public figure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so original as to guarantee in itself a Nobel Prize for peace or a Pulitzer Prize for investigative disclosure . However , Gold had an angle for a book on Kissinger he believed might do both . Gold had file drawers filled with all Kissinger 's writings and public statementsand with newspaper and magazine clippings of everything said about him . He collected clippings also of the writings and public statements of David Eisenhower . Sometimes he thought of mixing the two collections up . Sometimeshe found it difficult to keep them apart.  |p41I  was a cause of prolonged vexation to Gold that almost no one he knew read any of the publications in which his work was likely to appear . Let Gold 's name surface for a single mention in Playboy or Ladies ' Home Journal , however , and the whole world took cognizance at the same moment . Even Lieberman . Even Pomoroy . Even his father and stepmother , who read only the Times and Daily News in New York and nothing at all in Florida . They preferredwatching news broadcasts and old movies on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recounting the circumstances of their demise . " Hey , bigshot , " his father would bellow on the telephone , and Gold would wilt at once . " I see you got your name in Playboy again . That guy did n't think so much of you , did he ? " " Why ? " Gold was rankled . " He paid me a very nice compli-ment . " " Sure , that 's what he wrote , " said his father . " But I could read between the lines . " Encouraged and accompanied by Gussie , Gold 's father would move after dinner to the television set in whatever home he had decided to be driven to that evening and begin watching old movies with the energetic vigilance of a custodian of dead souls . The moviesthemselves made no difference . The responsibility for keeping score was only his . " ' That one 's gone , " he would shout elatedly like the grim reaper himself , as though collaring another trophy for his collection . " Ap42hundred years ago . Old age did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geshtorben . Heart attack . Gone in an instant . Look at that big guy there pushing everyone around . You know where he is today ? " " Dead ? " inquired Gold 's stepmother delicately , glancing up from her wool . In such moments , she recalled to Gold 's mind the image of Madame Defarge knitting at the foot of the guillotine . " You bet , baby , " answered Gold 's father . " In d'rerd . Now he ai n't pushing around people . He 's pushing up daisies . A suicide . They tried to hush it up , but they could n't fool me . " " I do believe , " said Gold 's stepmother , " that old governess has passed away too . " " Sure , she did , " Gold 's father agreed . " Cancer . It ate her up . See that taxi driver , the funny one ' ? Toyt . Like a doornail . A stroke . Maybe twenty years ago . Lingered a few weeks , then goodbyeCharlie . That crooked cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . Whiskey had something to do with it too . That one was a faygeleh ! " It was their favorite recreation , even in Gold 's apartment . Gold would sit with gritted teeth for as long as he could and then excuse himself with the explanation he had work to prepare . Belle , to her credit , remained , with the same hospitable consideration she showed to her own widowed mother . " He ai n't no Jew ! " Gold 's father had decided in Gold 's living room one evening as he watched another newscast of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger smiling still one more time into the press cameras as he descended from still one more airplane . Gold 's fatherturned to Gold as though daring opposition . " No , siree . He said he was a cowboy , did n't he ? A lonesome cowboy riding into town to get the bad guys , did n't he ? All by himself . Well , no cowboy was ever a Jew . " " Not , " said Gold 's stepmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " challenged Gold 's father . " Shepherds , maybe . No cowboys . " And Gold wondered if the Creator , in the giving of His laws to Moses on that cloud-covered mountain , had not also in His wisdom and mercy imparted a time limit on at least one of His Command/ments that had somehow been lost in translation after the tired old Patriarch made his way back down on a day that had been for himmore than usually distracting . How was it possible to honor a father who was so abrasive and married now to such a fuckingwack ? Yet it was shortly after this visit from his father that Gold openedhis dossier on Henry Kissinger and began outlining his strategy in closest secrecy . His file thickened rapidly . He began collecting clippings on David Eisenhower because he could not resist . From David Eisenhower he read : One improvement in the Nixon administration , due to Watergate , is that Mr. Nixon is no longer considered an unqualifiedgoody-goody . I never liked that idea . The image of the Nixon administrationis part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a goody-goody either . I am a contentious person in a lot of ways . I 'm glad that to a certain extent this ministerialcloak can be lifted from my shoulders . I 'm not just a goody-goody . For the first time in his life , possibly , Gold 's mind boggled . David Eisenhower , after all , was probably the outstanding Amherstalumnus of his generation . Gold was thankful he 'd clipped that interview . Someday , in respite from work that he knew waslargely undistinguished and , in every nuance of the adverb , abominablyintellectual , he might want to write comedy . Often since , Gold was amazed by things he found in newspapersand magazines . Many such groups of heckling , young hoodlums roamed at will among the crowd of 125,000 gathered at the WashingtonMonument for Human Kindness Day , robbing or beating 600 people . He clipped them all . They boggled his mind.  |p44GOLD  WAS the author of six nonfiction books , one of which , his first , was genuine , and that one an expansion of his doctoral dissertation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two of these collections each contained four or five fairly perceptivepieces in which he had been able to say something original effectively ; and a third included a long essay on the symbiotic relationship between cultural advance and social decay that had been reprinted widely and was still made reference to by commentatorson both sides of the matter  --  those in favor of social decay and those opposed . The remaining collection , his latest , was worthless . Gold thought much less of his work than even his fussiestdetractors , for he knew far better than they the diverse sources of most of his information and even of much of his language . Gold 's current scheme for a new collection was a volume of pieces from his previous collections . His short stories were mannered and trite , and he was content that they were published in far-flung quarterly magazines of very small circulation . His poems , he sensed , were atrocious , and these he submitted to obscure literary magazines in Pretoria and the Isle of Wight and to English-language university publications in Beirut , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry with people who had never read any . A problem with his stories and poems , Gold knew , was that they tended to be derivative , and mainly derivative , unfortunately , of works of his own . His novel , a work he had wrestled with , on and off , for almost three years , he had finally abandoned after one page . The novel was derivative of a poem Gold had written seven years before that was itself derived from a brilliant exegesis by a young Englishman of the works of Samuel Beckett that Gold wished he 'd written himself . ALTHOUGH IT was taken for granted by now that no one in Gold 's family was obliged to read anything he wrote , he nevertheless was held in some kind of baffled awe by everyone but his stepmother , who was fond of remarking that she thought he had a screw loose . Collections of his hooks and the periodicals in which reviews and articles by him had appeared were maintained in each of thep45households . Esther and Rose kept scrapbooks . Ida , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his book jackets in art frames in her foyer and living room . Belle 's mother pasted his titles on each piece of her luggage . Even Harriet and Sid showed his work off prominently in their large home in Great Neck on a polished sideboard facing the entrance to the house almost dead-on . But that was it . Beyond the title and opening sentences , he could have written fuck-all anywhere and the words would not have come to their attention . None of them , not even Belle or his two older sons or his unambitious twelveyear-olddaughter , were caught up irresistibly by his speculations on the fallacies of truth , his concepts for an ideal university , or his theories of cultural phylogeny and ultimate universal doom . It was usually after the publication of something new by Gold that his stepmother was prone to mention that his brains , in her opinion , were twisted , or that he had a screw loose . Gold , for his part , believed that she , in pace with his father , was losing her marbles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California and her husband , Jerry , seemed to understand who he really was and appreciate the high regard in which he was generally held by people who had never met him . Jerry gave parties whenever Gold came to California and relayed invitations for Gold to speak at temples and churches and before various adult civic and professional groups in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills , invitations Gold always declined . Jerry , the boorish overachiever , was too wealthy the community figure to suggest that Gold be paid a fee , and Gold was too successful the scholar to convey that he never spoke without one . If anything , his relatives had long ceased struggling to figure out what he was writing about or why . Their beliefs were simple . They liked education , the larger the amount , the better the effects . Gold could have demolished this simple faith in a pulverizing thunderclaphad he wished . They voted piously in every election , even Julius , his father , as though their doing so made a difference , but had no interest in government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , for politics and governmental operationswere among his most rewarding areas of discussion . Gold nop46longer even voted ; he could not , in fact , find any beneficial role for popular elections in the democratic process , but that was something else he could not disclose publicly without bringing blemish to the image he had constructed for himself as a radical moderate . Gold was a moderate now in just about everything , advocating , in Pomoroy 's description , fiery caution and crusading inertia . Inwardlyhe simmered often with envy , frustration , indignation , and confusion . Gold was opposed to segregation and equally opposed to integration . Certainly he did not believe that women , or homosexuals , should suffer persecution or discrimination . On the other hand , he was privately opposed to all equal rights amendments , for he certainly did not want members of either group associating with him on levels of equality or familiarity . And for the soundest reasons : his reasons were emotional , and emotions , he was concluding , particularly his own , could constitute the highest form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he could no longer find uncomplicated solutions , but he kept these embarrassingdilemmas to himself and continued to manifest in public an aspect of cordial poise and balanced judgment that made him acceptableto almost everyone . Gold could speak with aplomb now on politics , diplomacy , economics , education , war , sociology , ecology , social psychology , pop culture , fiction , and drama  --  and on any combinations of these in infinite permutations , for he had an inventive ability to relate anything to anything else . Gold was flexible and unopinionated now and able  --  with just a few minor adjustments in emphasis  --  to deliver essentially the same speech to an elderly reactionary religious group that he had given the day before with equal success to a congress of teen-aged Maoists . Gold could produce newspaper evidence that a former governor of Texas had not been brought to trial on all the counts for which he had been indicted , and he had used this information one evening to confirm the suspicions of an audience of millionairesthat the federal government had it in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an assembly of college students just thirty miles away that justice , in the presencep47of rich politicians , was not blind but merely looking the other way . The college students paid him seven hundred dollars for this talk . The millionaires gave him shit . He preferred the millionaires . In the last Presidential election , Gold had allowed his name to be listed among the sponsors of separate full-page newspaper advertisementssupporting the candidates of both political parties . For the advertisement supporting the candidates of the Democratic Party , Gold was asked to pay twenty-five dollars . For the other , the Republican Party met the whole cost in secrecy . From this Gold concluded that the Republican Party was the more humane and philanthropic , and he eased himself one stage farther toward the political right , and called it the center . Although he did not go so far as Lieberman , who was all for a totalitarian plutocracy , backed by repressive police actions when necessary  --  as long as the men on top were good to Jews like himself and let him have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name had appeared fraudulently as a contributing sponsor only in the ad deceitfully paid for by the Republican Party , was incensed that Gold , for only twenty-five dollars more , had his name in the newspapertwice . Gold , like Lieberman , loved getting his name in the papers , and his strongest surviving political sentiment lay in his wish for the good government position Ralph hinted might be found for him . Gold had neither illusions nor misgivings about the burdens of public office : the only great weight of public office he could see was staying in , and he was in a quandary only a moment when the opportunity came to review the President 's book . There had been no advance word that such a mansucript even was in preparation . He was surprised , of course , by the oddity of a President who had chosen to write about his experiences in office after being there so short a time . But Gold had managed to cast even this unusual circumstance in a favorable light in the thoughtfulappraisal he wrote of My Year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to open communicationsfrom the start with what Gold luckily described as his " contemporaryuniversal constituency . " The term proved more felici/tous than Gold could have imagined . The President himself repeated it twice daily on a whirlwind goodwill tour he made to parts of the world in which he was despised . Journalists felt consciencebound to credit Gold with the phrase whenever they reportedit . Gold had no idea what it meant . Even more surprising had been the telephone call from Ralph Newsome to thank him on behalf of the White House . " Where do you shine in ? " Gold inquired . Ralph still sounded truthful . They had lost touch with each other since their fellowshipsat the Senator Russell B. Long Foundation seven years back . " I 'm at the White House now , " Ralph answered . " I 'm on the staff . " Gold was impressed . " How come I have n't read about you ? " " You probably have but did n't realize it , " said Ralph . " I do a lot of work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . You see , Bruce , I 'm in the inner circle and very little of what I do gets outside . It really boosted my stock here when they found out I knew you , " Ralph continued . " The President was very pleased with what you had to say . " " Tell him , " said Gold , " I 'm glad . Tell him I tried very hard to be fair . " " You were , " said Ralph , " and he knows that . Very fair . We got lots of gushy reviews , like Lieberman 's , but most of those were from people who wanted something . I ca n't think of any that was more pertinent and balanced than yours . " " I hope , " said Gold , " that I was n't too unsparing . " " You were just unsparing enough , " Ralph reassured him . " This President welcomes criticism , Bruce , and he found your suggestionshelpful . Particularly those about his sentence structure and paragraph organization . You seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Ralph , there were a few things that did puzzle me . " " What were they , Bruce ? " " Well , frankly , Ralph  --  " " Be frank , Bruce . " " Most Presidents wait until their terms are over before theyp49write their memoirs . This one seems to have started right in the day he took office . " Ralph assented with a modest laugh . " That was my idea , " he admitted . " This way he has a crack at more than just one best seller . He might do one every year . That boosted my stock way up with him too . " " There was one more thing . But I decided not to go into it . " " What was that , Bruce ? " " Well , Ralph , he must have spent an awful lot of time his first year in office writing this book about his first year . Yet , nowhere in the book does he say anything about being busy writing the book . " Ralph cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked . I 'm glad you did n't go into it . " " Where did he find the time ? " " We all pitched in and helped , " Ralph replied . " Not with the writing , you understand , but with most of the other junk a Presidenthas to attend to . Every word was his own . " Gold said he understood . This President really knows how to delegate responsibility , Bruce . Otherwise , he never would have gotten it done . It would be a lot like Tristram Shandy trying to write down the story of his life . Bruce , remember Tristram Shandy and that paper I copied from you ? " " I certainly do , " said Gold with a touch of pique . " You got a better grade than I did and even had the paper published . " " I got a better grade on all the papers I copied from you , did n't I ? " Ralph reminded him . " Bruce , this President is a very busy man . He has to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to write about them , even when he 's doing nothing more than writing about all the things he 's supposed to be doing . That 's why he needs all the help he can get . Bruce , have you ever thought of working in government ? " Gold learned in that instant what a heart felt like when it skipped a heat . " No , " he answered steadily . " Should I ? " " It 's fun , Bruce . There are lots of parties and you get lots of girls . Even actresses . "  | " What kind of job would I have ? " " That 's difficult to say now . I 'll have to ask around . But you 've got the right educational background and a gift for punchy phrases I think we can use . I ca n't promise anything this second . But I 'm sure it would be something very , very big , if you 'll say you 'd consider it . " " I would consider it , " Gold disclosed , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatically . I 'm sure it will be favorable . I keep running into Andrea Biddle Conover down here . Remember her ? " " Of course , " Gold replied . " I thought you would . She had a crush on you that year at the Foundation . " " She did n't . " " Sure , she did . Still does . I always felt there might be something between you . " " There was n't , " Gold insisted , with regret . " She never said anything . " " She was too shy . " " I always liked her . " " She always asks about you . " " How is she ? " " As nice as ever . Tall , pretty , cheerful , smart . And very , very rich , with those fine , strong , beautiful teeth . " Gold pursed his lips and whistled silently . " Give her , " he said , " my best . Tell her I asked about her . " " I will , " said Ralph . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " In that case , give her my love . " " I will . And you say hello to Sally . " Ralph said , " Sally who ? " " Your wife , " said Gold . " Are n't you married to Sally ? " " Oh , heavens , no , " Ralph replied . " I 've been married to Ellieever since my divorce from Kelly . There was that legal problemover my annulment from Norah , but Nellie , thank the Lord  --  " " Ralph , wait , for Chrissakes ! " It was in self-defense that Goldprotested . " You 're boggling my mind . "  | " What was that ? " Ralph asked in surprise . " You 're boggling my mind . " " Bruce , that 's a good phrase , " Ralph cried crisply . " Damned good . I do n't think I 've ever heard boggle used with an animate subject before . I 'll bet all of us down here can start getting mileage out of that one right away . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting us have it . " " Ralph  --  " " Excuse me a minute , Bruce . I want to get it down exactly the way you said it . How did it go ? " " You 're boggling my mind . " " I preferred it the first way . " " That was the first way . " " I guess it 's good enough . " Ralph sounded disappointed . " Now what was it you wanted to say to me ? " " Ralph , you 're boggling my mind . " " That 's the way ! " Ralph exclaimed . " It 's the same way ! " Gold retorted . " You 're right , Bruce . I 'm glad we did n't lose it . How , Bruce ? How am I boggling your mind ? " " With your Nellies and your Kellys and your Norahs and your Ellies . I thought you and Sally were so right for each other . " " We were , " Ralph answered , sounding puzzled . " Was n't the marriage working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatic . " We had a perfect marriage . " " Then why did you get a divorce ? " " Well , Bruce , to put it plainly , I could n't see much point in tying myself down to a middle-aged woman with four children , even though the woman was my wife and the children were my own . Can you ? " Seldom had Gold come to a conclusion so swiftly . " Be Be sure to tell Andrea Conover I was thrilled to hear about her , " he said . " And that I hope we 'll bump into each other soon . " " I 'll get hack to you quickly . " " Please . " ( fold 's pulse raced with excitement . He had visions . He knew he was ten times more intelligent than Ralph and could go onep52thousand times farther in government if ever he got a foot in . And if Ralph could get married to Ellie after his divorce from Kelly after that trouble over the annulment from Norah or Nellie , there was no reason in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just captured this point in his deliberations when his telephone rang again . " IT LOOKS good , Bruce , " Ralph declared happily . Not more than five minutes had passed , and Gold could picture Ralph sounding out sentiment diplomatically with a shout down a corridor . Except that Ralph was too well-bred to shout . " You 're really boggling my mind the way you 're boggling everyone 's mind with those phrases of yours . First contemporary universal constituency ' and now this you 're boggling my mind . ' I tried it out on a couple of people and it boggled their minds . We all feel it would be a good idea to start using you here as quickly as possible if we decide we want to use you at all . " " What kind of job would I have ? " " Any one you want , " Ralph replied , " depending on what 's open at the time we take you on . We have lots of turnover . " " Oh , come on , Ralph , " Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph seemed faintly puzzled again . " Why not ? " " A Senator ? " " That 's elective . " " An ambassador ? " " Not right away . At the start , we 'll want you in Washington . You see , Bruce , we have a very big need for college professors , and we ca n't go back to Harvard after all they 've done . The country would n't stand for it . " " How 's Columbia ? " " Still clean . I do n't think anyone here associates Columbia with anything intellectual . And Brooklyn , of course , is perfect . " " What would I have to do ? " " Anything you want , as long as it 's everything we tell you to say and do in support of our policies , whether you agree with them or not . You 'll have complete freedom . "  |p53Gold  was confused . He said delicately , " I ca n't be bought , Ralph . " " We would n't want you if you could be , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want yes-men . What we want are independent men of integrity who will agree with all our decisionsafter we make them . You 'll be entirely on your own . " " I think I might fit in , " Gold decided . " I 'm glad . Gosh , it will be good being together again , Bruce , wo n't it ? Remember all those great times we used to have ? " Gold could remember no great times with Ralph . " We 'll want to move ahead with this as speedily as possible , although we 'll have to go slowly . At the moment , there 's nothing to be done . " " I 'll need some time anyway , " Gold volunteered obligingly . " I 'll have to prepare for a leave of absence . " " Of course . But do n't say anything about it yet . We 'll want to build this up into an important public announcement , although we 'll have to be completely secret . " Gold listened for some signal of jocularity in Ralph 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you is unpopular , " Ralph went on in the same informativeway , " we 'll start getting criticism about it even before we announce it . If the appointment is popular , we 'll run right into tremendous opposition from the other party and from our own left , right , and center . That 's why it 's good you 're a Jew . " That word Jew fell with a crash upon Gold 's senses . " Why , Ralph ? " he managed to say . " Why is it good to have someone ... who is Jewish ? " " That will make it easier at both ends , Bruce , " Ralph explained with no change of tone . " Jews are popular now and people do n't like to object to them . And a Jew is always good to get rid of whenever the right wing wants us to . " Gold said nonchalantly , " You 're being rather blunt about that , Ralph , are n't you ? " " Well , Bruce , it 's better than adopting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocently , missing the point of Gold 's objection . " And that 's the time we can make you an ambassador , if there 's a good European country open that needs one . Or we can make you head of NA 'll ) if you 'd like . "  | " Ralph , are you serious ? Could I really be head of NATO ? " " I do n't see why not . " " I have no military experience . " " I really do n't think that matters , Bruce . Do n't forget , there are other countries in NATO . I 'm sure they have people who know about things like that . " Gold saw no profit in disagreement . " I think I 'd rather be an ambassador , " he decided . " Whatever you choose . But that 's looking far ahead . I 'll get back to you immediately , Bruce , although it might take time . Just try not to think about it . Do n't phone me here . They do n't like personal calls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of anything else . At the start of the second week , an evil thought entered Gold 's mind and refused to depart , a perversive blot of caustic wisdom first obtained by him as a sullen insult from a student to whom he had given a failing grade the semester before . " Do n't trust Whitey . " THE MORE Gold speculated on his conversation with Ralph , the more he inclined toward the ambassadorship in preference to commandof NATO . Military life did not appeal to him : he was not comfortable near explosives . And military prestige was of little weight outside the camping grounds . Neither position , he was forced to remind himself , was a probability . Ralph had guaranteed nothing . Belle had declared stoutly that she would not move to Washington with him if he took a job there , and he was relying on her to keep her word . An ambassadorship , though , would be lovely , he fancied in periodsof luxurious reverie that reappeared between his longer spells of uneventful disappointment . He could easily imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgravia , marriednow not to Belle but to some languorous , exquisite , young blond Englishwoman of noblest birth . She was a floating seraph of ageless and ethereal beauty who brought him tea with sugar cubes on a tray . She was tall and gracefully round-shouldered , had thin limbs , pale , pearly skin , and narrow violet-blue eyes of fascinating depth and brightness , and she adored him . lie , for his part , couldp55take her or leave her alone . She never spoke . She was n't Jewish . They had separate bedrooms with many sitting rooms and dressing rooms in between . He wore elegant silk dressing gowns all day long . His breakfast was brought to him in bed . When a second week went by without word from Ralph , Gold got to work on the book he owed Pomoroy and the digest of that book he owed Lieberman . He wondered which to do first . His mother was dead and he could write about her : a young woman , a girl , really , with Sid , who was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emigrating from an inhospitable Russian countryside with that young cockalorum of a husband  --  good God , was he that way even then ?  --  to live in this alien land and die before she was fifty . He had forgotten that Rose was born in Europetoo . His mother had never learned English well enough to read it or to understand much when the children were talking to each other . He recalled that long period when her neck was swaddledin odorous bandages  --  was it goiter ? He would have to ask . And he was ashamed to be seen with her in the street . Now , people were emigrating north from Puerto Rico , Haiti , and Jamaica . Blacks had moved down from Harlem and were overflowing into groups interloping from the South and West , and Gold felt besieged and invaded , his safety eroding , his position marginal and impermanent . His marriage to Belle was just about dead , and he could abstract from that  --  if he ever learned what those words meant . He did not know what was intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer a real marriage . Were marriages ever different ? Or was it that people and their surroundings had changed , and that every change had been for the worse ? Gold had a thought for another article . On a slip of paper he printed : EVERY CHANGE IS FOR THE WORSEbyBRUCE GOLDHe pinned the slip to the bulletin board above the desk in his studio and began making notes for that work too while he waited to hear from Ralph.  |p59THEY  had all come together some thirty years earlier lumbia University in New York , Ralph arriving late with an graduate degree from Princeton , Pomoroy departing early v his doctorate after completing his course work and passing 1 examinations . Appraising his talents and wants realistically oroy had wisely terminated all thought of producing a disse on a subject of no authentic appeal , and gone off to find tljobhe could . He began as an editorial assistant with a sma book firm . Now he was executive editor with a larger , g publishing company , where he would likely prosper and riPomoroy was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hastily written pages he felt would make an important book , and Pomoroy was the edit ( always spurned him first . Lieberman had started one novel autobiographies , and several searching studies of current pr ( he believed indispensable to people charged with solving Gold went to Pomoroy only when his chances were bette elsewhere . Pomoroy was no fool . Harris Rosenblatt , another Jewish acquaintance of the r was a plodding , unimaginative dumbbell who had come to ( from a private school in Manhattan that required students ti blazers and to have their hair cut and combed trimly am necks and ears washed . By steadfast drudgery , Harris Rom had made it through Columbia College with honors and thi fled from graduate work in less than a year before the lengtp60threat of unavoidable failure . He married shortly afterward and went to work in some arcane department of an investment house controlled by his wife 's family  --  he himself was incapable of describingwhat that department did . There he excelled , at work he did not understand and whose meaning he could not apprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on national fiscal matters , to whom he always impartially made the same terse recommendation : " Balance the budget . " And for these few words , Harris Rosenblatt was regarded in elite business and social circles with something approaching veneration . Harris Rosenblatt had found , in Pomoroy 's acerbic depiction , his ideal habitat , the only one , in Darwinian terms , in which he was fit to survive : three pounds of human brain mass dumped immovably on an area of financial specialization too minute to be defined , in a cranny too obscure to admit any irritating rays of light . It was Harris Rosenblatt , Gold suspected , who had arranged for Lieberman 's invitation to the White House at the time of the Vietnam war . Not many people other than the President allowed Lieberman into their homes for dinner . If the White House was going to be so unparticular , Lieberman was not the person to dismiss the opportunity . " Listen , " he had boasted once to Pomoroy and Gold with his crude and exultant laugh , " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supporting a war . I would support a war every day in the week if I knew I could eat at the White House again . " And then was thrown into confusion as both Pomoroy and Gold shrank from him with looks of undisguised abhorrence . Gold had known Lieberman since childhood and had never liked him . It was an unfading source of pleasure now to be able to say , " You know , truthfully , Maxwell , I never really liked you . " In high school , Lieberman had demanded of everyone that he be called Maxwell . Now that the name had grown unbearable to him , Gold took relish in using it , especially in the company of other people who knew him only by his auctorial identity , M. G. Lieberman , and to whom the name Maxwell came as a source of delight . Not till college had Lieberman adopted the affectation of using just the initials of ' his given names on everything he wrote , even home/work . In conversation and on radio talk shows to which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , Gordon , or by the happy-go-lucky sobriquet with which he had festooned himself when he was already past forty-five , the nicknameSkip . " Skip , " Pomoroy repeated sourly , as though discovering a wedge of lemon between his teeth . " Why not Curly ? " " My hair is n't really curly . " " And your name is n't Skip , " Pomoroy had replied . " It 's my nickname . " " No , it is n't . People do n't give themselves nicknames , Lieberman . They inspire them in others . Whatever you are now , Lieberman , or ever hope to be  --  please do n't interrupt me , you baldy , fatheaded buffoon , I have spied your name often at testimonial banquets at which fascists and anti-Semites were among the featuredspeakers  --  you are not now and never will be a Skip . " " It 's what my friends used to call me , " Lieberman pouted . " No , it is n't . " Gold did not look up from the turkey sandwich he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but you did n't . They called me Four-Eyes for a while . They called you Fatso , but that was a description . And you did n't have any friends . I did n't have any either . But I had more than you . " " I was your friend . " " I did n't want you . I only used you when nobody better would play with me . " Lieberman and Gold had lived in Coney Island across the street from each other in walk-up apartment houses near Surf Avenue , and Gold had never cared any more for Lieberman than others had cared for Gold . Gold spent much of his childhood on the fringe of exile . When sides were chosen for any kind of game , Gold would not know until the captains came down to the dregs if he would be picked at all ; when he was , he was so grateful he could have wept . On Saturday afternoons when everyone went to the movies in groups , he was never confident he would be asked by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life would he have hesitated even one second if given the chance to exchange his **25;5884;TOOLONG for friendships with such local ne'er-do-wells or social leaders as Spotty Weinrock or Fishy Siegel . Fishy 's older brother Sheiky , an illegal beach peddler of ice cream in summer and street vendor of costume jewelry in the winter , was now the owner of millions of dollars in computer and reinsurance stocks and the controller of perhaps many millions more in real-estate syndicates and mutual funds . Go figure him . It was mainly because of Rose 's or Esther 's scrupulous devotion that Gold 's myopic astigmatism was discovered early , and Gold was probably the first his age in the neighborhood to wear eyeglasses . Even Sid and Muriel called him Four-Eyes . Perhaps Gold was able to get top grades in elementary school because he was the only one who could see . Lieberman was more ambitious from the start . By the time he was eight , he was already given.to chesty boasting . " When I grow up , " he announced to Gold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fat . I 'll be the fattest guy in the whole world . " That was one of the earliest of Lieberman 's goals , to be fat . In every class , he seized command of all positions open , from blackboardand wastebasket monitor to class messenger , and , ultimately , the capstone of this phase of his career , chief of the safety patrol . Lieberman , rolling with a cockier swagger whenever he wore his metal badge , set records for reporting students for jaywalkinguntil Fishy Siegel threatened to break his head if he did n't stop . Spotty Weinrock said he would do the same . Lieberman cried . That afternoon he resigned from the safety patrol . Lieberman ate and talked unceasingly . By the time he was nine , he never hesitated to dispute socialism , fascism , and the labor movement with old European Jews on the Coney Island boardwalk . His characteristic argument was that they did not know what they were talking about . It probably was not true , as Pomoroy had remarked , that given the option , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a headstart . But it was probably not entirely false . Liebermanstill could not keep his hands off food , his own or others ' ,  |p63even  though he no longer wanted to be fat . He had never held any elective office in school because he could not find anyone to nominatehim , second him , or vote for him . " I do n't care , " Lieberman proclaimed to Gold in the fifth or sixth grade , holding back tears . " When I grow up , I 'll be a fat cabinet officer . I 'll be the first Jewish Secretary of State . I bet I 'll even get to meet the President . " Then he moved away from Coney Island to the bordering , more elegant neighborhood of Brighton Beach . By the time Gold entered Abraham Lincoln High School , Lieberman was already there as a sophomore , having vaulted ahead one school year somehow , and was making a name for himself as an outstanding student and a putz . He was on the staff of the literary magazine and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontested control of both . He was active in political matters and co-captain of the debating team , which always lost . Gold avoided him . Shunning the literary magazine in high school because of Lieberman , Gold mailed ten of his short poems to The Saturday Review of Literature . Six came back with rejection slips and four were accepted , at a price of ten dollars each . Lieberman turned blue . He swore he would never forgive Gold for acting alone instead of sharing his initiative . To teach Gold his place , Lieberman mailed twenty-five of his poems to The Saturday Reviewof Literature . Thirty-nine came back . " What do I care ? " Lieberman sneered . " When I grow up I 'm gon na be rich . I 'll be more famous than anyone . I 'm gon na marry a rich and famous heiress . I 'll never lose my hair . I 'll wear lots of rings . I 'll go into politics and win . I 'll be a mayor , a senator , and the governor of all New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " he vowed , " I 'm gon na fuck a girl . " Instead , he went to college . He was still fat . His hair was no longer thick . Everything he ate he still ate with both fists . He gorged himself from other people 's plates . Pomoroy was there from a college-educated family in Massachusetts , and Harris Rosenblatt from his private school in Manhattan and a strict , proud German-Jewish family on Riverside Drive . Inp64graduate school Ralph Newsome , from a wealthy family in Michigan , joined the group by way of Princeton University . It was inevitable that Lieberman would make a shambles of each class . He interrupted with contrary views and overblown objectionsand shouted answers to every question asked . Students and faculty learned to yield him a wide berth rather than contend with him . Experienced professors blanched when he signed up for their courses , and mature students , including tough marines from Iwo Jima and army veterans of the Battle of the Bulge , calmly rearranged their programs when they found him in class on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of study . For many of the most illustrious scholars and teachers on the faculty , Liebermanwas precisely the factor needed to bring them to decisions perhaps long in the balance  --  divorce , murder , mental breakdown , early retirement , or changes to different occupations or new teachingpositions at other universities . And finally , when Lieberman , with Gold and Ralph Newsome , had completed all the requirements for his doctorate , he surveyed with disgruntlement the campusfrom the steps of Low Library and complained , You know , this is n't such a first-rate university any more , is it ? We should have gone to Yale . " He chose to forget that all had been rejected by Yale . All but Ralph , who had been accepted everywhere . Ralph had chosen Columbiabecause he wanted to live in New York for a while , and because he had guessed that he would be able to find someone like Gold who would make his work there easier . " The truth is , " Pomoroy had observed in customary melancholy the last time the three had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished very much . " And Lieberman , vowing he would never forgive him for saying that , began another autobiography . THE PITY lay , Gold reflected on the indoor track at the Y after completing the first of his nine sets of eight laps without dropping dead , in their having wanted to achieve some kind of glorious success almost from the moment of birth . Goals , he muttered as he pounded along steadily on the short oval course while the painp65departed from his chest and settled and throbbed in his dangling kidneys , we ai n't got any real ones . Still , it 's better to have shit to shoot at than nothing . Gold held to the superstitious belief that if he could survive the first eight laps without some fatal bursting of the blood , he would make it to the end with the Angel of Death still behind , a loser again . The track was almost empty , which pleased him . It was there on the track while running his grueling three miles several days a week that many of Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he discharged , for a time , the stewing hostility and mordant self-pity that pooled like poison almost daily in his soul . Envy would dissolve with exertion into euphoria by the time he had showered and dressed and was limping away . There is no disappointment so numbing , he brooded as he entered the last lap of his first mile and felt the muscles of his calves cramp , as someone no better than you achieving more . Forty-eight laps to go . There would be no heartburn today . Soon the muscles of his calves would feel fine , as his kidneys now did , and the tendons of both ankles would whine with each footfall . He could look forward next to a strain in his left groin and then to a vertical shaft of pain on his right side that was rooted in his appendix and rose through his liver , chest , and shoulder blade to his collarbone and neck . Each wound in the sequence could register only singly . Another thought that returned often when he jogged was that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since starting to exercise strenuously several years before , that he was able to make love with greater vitality , stamina , and self-control than formerly , and with much less pleasure . He also found he had less time for it and was often in too much physical torture and debilitation afterward to want to . He lusted more desirously for a nap . Gold no longer suffered from early-morning lower backache . Now he had it all day long . For Gold , Lieberman , and Pomoroy , there had been sound reason for their expectations . But the real stars had sprung from other quarters , and before they knew it , they had been left behind . All had gotten what they wanted , and felt dissatisfied . Lieberman had wanted to edit a small intellectual publication , and he did . Gold hoped to obtain a decent teaching post in New York and gain somep66stature as a writer , and he had . Pomoroy wanted to be a book editor , and he was . All were successful , and felt like failures . Gold no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pretended not to . He knew the components that were necessary : None . Or maybe one : Dumb luck . Harris Rosenblatt , with his inanimate powers of concentration and no ability at thought , was now a name to be reckoned with ; he was a member of Protestant clubs that admitted no Jews , and a trustee of Jewish clubs that admitted only Germans . " Balance the budget , " appeared to be the longest , and perhaps only , recommendationhe could put together . While Sheiky from Neptune Avenue , truant , high-school dropout , and raffish summer ice-cream peddler , had millions and had jousted with Nelson Rockefeller at a formal dinner for fat cats when the latter was campaigning for governor of New York . " Hiya , fella , " said Nelson Rockefeller to Sheiky from Neptune Avenue . " I will be grateful for your support . " " What 's in it for me ? " asked Sheiky . He kept his hands in the pockets of his pants . Never in his life would Sheiky from Neptune Avenue offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person who might want something from him . Rockefeller drew back in bewilderment . " Good government , " an eager aide with a florid face interjected quickly . " Who needs it ? " Sheiky said , grinning amiably . " I 'm doing just fine with the kind we 've got . " Sid , who related that episode often , was another anomaly in the freakish catalogue of success . Silent and complicated in the home when young , low-keyed in ambition , and of only average attainmentsin school , Sid had somehow managed to acquire and improvecertain patents for commercial laundry equipment after returningfrom the army in 1945 . Ideas for other machines followed , then a company for processing fabrics . Now he had plenty of money and dispensed it more liberally than Ilarriet liked.  |p67Earlier  he had worked harder , half days after school and full time in summer as a laborer at the Brighton Laundry when the red vans were still drawn by horses . Sid was afraid of the horses . After graduating from high school he stayed as an assistant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tailor shop his father owned off and on in those hazardous years following 1929 . Mixed in somewhere in his history was the summer he had run away from home . Sundays , when he could , and even Saturday nights , he worked in the checkroom at catered affairs at a banquet hall . He did not like these weekend jobs or the rented tuxedo he had to wear , but this was the Great Depression . His father 's incomewas uncertain , his occupations erratic . Rose and Esther sought work in Woolworth 's after school as soon as each was old enough , and at the hot-dog and custard stands on the boardwalk in summer . All were pressed into duty to deliver the suits and dresses and obtain payment in cash . No one 's credit was good . Julius Gold was always selling and returning to the same tailor shop , on the sidewalk level of the apartment house in which they lived . They had an Atwater-Kent radio in the living room , and they were one of the first families on the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the only family with as many as seven children . With unerring intuition , he always sold to incompetents or invalids , and the shop was always available to him for just the rent whenever his newest escapade into the fashionable world of trade and manufacturing had again gone bust . Gold 's mother was a good dressmaker and seamstress and would work downstairs in the store when she was not shopping for meals or tending the house . The tailor shop was a bustling extension of the apartment upstairs ; sandwiches would be devoured with milk by Rose , Esther , Ida , and Muriel during the lunch recess at school or with giant bottles of flavored soda pop from the candy store across the street . Gold eon Id remember whole mornings and afternoons idled away on the hathroom-tiled floor , with his sister Joannie just outside the plateglasswindow in a baby carriage for as long as the sunlight fell there , his mother whizzing away at the Singer sewing machine or stitching by hand with a thimbled finger , while his father hummed in sang bouncy dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the presser . Gold had hazy remembrancesof a catastrophic spell long before World War II when his father abruptly divined himself a singer of extraordinary talents and sought to enter singing contests and perform on radio amateur hours . The older members of the family seemed in panic and shock . They were stunned and mortified again by another family disgrace after the war , this time Gold too , when they discovered that Joannie , with a friend , was working in a sleazy purple nightgownat one of the stalls in the amusement area near the train stop , lying in bed doing nothing while patrons threw baseballs at a bull's-eye that would tumble her out . There was sickly silence in the house for weeks . She was just eighteen . And then she was gone with the friend , to enter beauty pageants , work for entertainment directors at resort hotels , and then to Florida , California , and even Cuba , in search of a Hollywood career as an actress , or as a dancer or model . By then , his mother too was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 , she had been ailing for several years , and the tailor shop was closed . His father , with partners , was doing subcontracteddefense work in a small loft on Canal Street , drilling holes through templets for small parts of Bendix airplane turrets that Sid , an enlisted man in the Army Air Force , was helping maintain in North Africa . His father wanted to expand rapidly , build the whole turrets  --  " What do we need them for ? "  --  and was quarreling ferociouslywith his partners . Rose was married to Max , and she and Esther had real jobs , Rose the job she never would change . Ida was in college and Muriel and Gold in high school . Gold 's father , Gold judged sourly later , was probably the only person in the countrydoing defense work and losing money . Sid made sergeant as an armorer , loading bombs and belted ammunitioninto planes , servicing weapons . He was fascinated with this first contact with cams , springs , sears , solenoid switches , and hydraulics . He was inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine gun had come his reposeful laundrymachines . " What minds ! " Sid mused now on the patio of his house in Great Neck . " To invent machines . A piece of metal doing one thing that can make another piece of metal do something else . Ip69swear to God if not for those machine guns I never would have thought of that laundry equipment . " " Who helped you , Sid ? " reminded Gold 's father , in a bid for praise . " You , Pop . But Sheiky from Neptune Avenue put in the money . And Kopotkin with the ice skates did most of the work . He had his own machine shop after the war . " " You trusted them , you dope ? " said Julius Gold . " How 'd you know they would n't steal from you ? " Sid handled the question with benevolence . " I just did n't think about that . Maybe friends did n't steal from each other then . Pop , " Sid finally found nerve enough to suggest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to buy a condominium . " The old man tensed . " I do n't stay in Florida that much . " " You could rent it out when you 're here , and probably get back all your costs . " The old man took a long puff on his cigar . " You 'll explain to me next weekend , when you come to us for lunch . You come too , " he said to Gold . " It will all work out fine , " Sid murmured with a smile , crossing his hands over his middle with a deep sigh and sinking back further in his recliner . But Gold was n't fooled by Sid 's air of contentment , and was positive there abided in Sid still , like a hole , the retrospective regret that he had missed out on college . But thoughts of a college education were simply not in the cards for high-school graduates of Sid 's time in that place . The most one might reach toward , like Rose 's Max , was an excellent score on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state on a test for the Post Office Department . His picture was in the Brooklyn section of the Sunday News . He had worked in a post office ever since . The sole exception in the neighborhood was crazy Murshie Weinrock , who plodded away in night classes in college for four , five , six years , until World War II . Then the army moved him to Swarthmore College into one of those opulent training programs for college students for the remainder of his senior year and then to the Harvard Medical School . Again , dumb luck . If not for Adolfp70Hitler he might still be sweeping trimmings in his uncle 's gritty millinery factory . Today he was an internist in Manhattan with a practice growing almost faster than his ability to handle it . Dr. Murray Weinrock always made room for old friends . Gold had been to him in the middle of the week . Skinny Murshie Weinrock was now an overweight , haggard chain smoker with the troubled look of somebody endlessly overworked . With Gold , he exercised a fitful sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps depraved . " You sure look lousy . " Gold , always in low spirits at his yearly checkup , said , " Thanks , Mursh . So do you . " " How do you feel ? " asked Mursh Weinrock urgently , in the middle of the examination . " Right now ? " " Awful . You 've got that thing up my ass . " " How long have you had that cough ? " " Since you stabbed that tongue depressor down on my tongue . " In the room with the electrocardiograph , Lucille , the large , handsome , dignified , unsmiling black nurse Gold had known for years , bent toward him with a baleful glare and said , " I know you been fucking the doctor 's wife . Lie still , please . How you expect that motherfucking machine to do what it 's s'posed to ? " Gold felt all strength drain from him . Lucille was an educated technician with enunciation superior to his own . " Next time I X-ray your chest , " she warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your balls . Did n't I ask you to please lie still ? Next time you pee in a bottle I 'm gon na put poison in without telling anybody and the doctor going to cut both your kidneys out . " " Uh-oh , this might be serious , " Mursh Weinrock said in his office with an ominous start when he studied the waves on the electrocardiogram . " It looks to me like you 've been fucking my wife . " " How is Mildred ? " Gold asked wryly . " You saw my father last week . " " He told me I was doing everything wrong . " " How 's his lungs ? " " Clear as a whistle and as good as gold . He 's got the descending bowel of a healthy adolescent . You could eat your food off it . "  | " I could throw you out the window for a remark like that , " said Gold . " Should n't he be in a warmer climate ? " " Only when he 's cold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hip and foot and a definite hardening of the arteries , and that will keep him feeling miserable much of the time . " " Why do n't you fucks find a cure for that already ? " Gold grumbled . " Biology does n't want us to . Nature abhors old age . " " He still starts off the day with a herring and baked potato . And some Greek olives . " " So ? " " Is that good for him ? " " When it is n't , he 'll know it before we do . Look , Bruce , your father 's past eighty . How much difference will it make if we feed him baby food ? Let 's get back to you . Venereal disease . . . yet ? " " You 're the last one I 'd tell . " " Patient denies venereal disease . " " You rig this for me , do n't you ? " Gold charged . " Rig what ? " " You know fucking well what I mean . You and Lucille certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , do you ? " " Which way ? " " You 're the perfect anodyne for somebody with tension . " " Tension ? " " I may be changing jobs soon , for a big one in government . That has to remain secret . " " Who cares ? " " Do n't coddle me . " " See my lazy kid brother much ? " Gold shook his head in reply to this question about Spotty Weinrock . " I do n't think Spotty 's done one minute 's hard work in his whole life . " " Nah , Mursh , " Gold reminded . " Remember how he got his nickname , working for my loony father  --  for just about a day and a half , now that you mention it  --  taking stains out of clothes in the old man 's tailor shop . " " His nickname was Speed at home , and he got it from my mother as a sarcasm . It was the first word of English she learned . ' Spit ' is what she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still pretended he did n't know how to put his socks on . One or the other of us would have to rush in and finish dressing him so he could go to high school . Then  --  " Dr. Murray Weinrock waved a forefinger in the air with the apocalyptic vengeance of a Biblical prophet  --  " then I knew how Cain must have felt about Abel , and my sympathies shifted . If I had the thighbone of a bullockhandy , I would have walloped him dead a hundred times . I hate sloth . Let 's get serious now . Your weight is good and your heart and blood pressure are fine . Sid could lose some weight and use some exercise , but so could I. " " What about my fatigue ? " " Too much sex life . I want you to stop fucking my wife . " " There are nights I ca n't resist . " " Get yourself a cute young girl instead . " Gold 's differing view was that most women did not even learn to begin enjoying sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding he could not publish while he was still teaching , while he was still married , and while his twelve-year-old daughter was still under thirty . Even without a business education , Sid understood merger better than Gold ever would . With hardly a pause for breath , Sid had taken the old man 's final business enterprise , a wobbling leatherproductsfactory on the brink of collapse , submerged it forever in an overlapping mist of other business entities , and conjured up magically an asset sufficiently grand to enable their father to retire with a fixed yearly income and a blazing self-respect that was inflatedand inimitable . He displayed like an aura the lordly demeanorof a man who not only had dined on success throughout his lifetime but also had been born into it . Sid fed extra money to him , as did most of the others . Gold had chipped in for the good used car in which Gussie drove them about in Florida . To Sid , Julius gave all credit . " Sid fixed it so I would first get my unemployment insurance , then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hit harder , " Gold quipped meanly , " he could have had you on welfare . " When Gold was a child , Sid was already working summers ,  |p73weekends  , and weekday afternoons . When Gold was in high school , Sid was overseas in the army . And the year Gold entered college , Sid was discharged from the service , eligible for higher education under the G.I. Bill of Rights , but already thirty-one . Conceivably they might have begun as freshmen together , and Gold could have cut him to ribbons in the hectic rivalry of classroomexhibitionism . Gold was alert to incongruities : Sid , who had sacrificed , was exempt from complaints , while Gold , the beneficiary , teemed with them . Gold was not sure of many things , but he was definite about one : for every successful person he knew , he could name at least two others of greater ability , better character , and higher intelligence who , by comparison , had failed . And Gold knew something else : he was in a predicament , confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could not much longer be concealed . All his words had a starkly humanitariancast ; yet he no longer liked people . He was losing his taste for mankind . There was not much he did like . He liked goods , money , honors . He missed capital punishment , but did not feel he could say so . Gold had a growing list of principles , causes , methods , and ideals in which he no longer believed ; and near the top it contained a swelling subdivision of freedomsthat included such sacrosanct issues as academic freedom , sexual freedom , and even political freedom . Alternatives were hellish . By no stretch of the imagination could he feel that this was what the Founding Fathers had in mind . Either Gold had grown more conservative or civilization had grown progressively worse . Or both . Certainly , nothing proceeded according to desire . In the long run , failure was the only thing that worked predictably . All else was accidental . Good intentions had miscarried , and bad ones had not improved . The American economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entrenched imbecility on all levels of the culture . Technology and finance mass-produced poverty at increasingspeed , the sole manufactured item in the whole industrial inventory that had not once suffered a slackening in rate of growthp74in the last fifty-five years , not in acreage or in populations . Communismwas a drab , gray , wintry prison at the end of a cul-de-sac from which no turning back was imaginable . And this was with a revolution that had succeeded . What else was there ? Imperialism , that faithful ogre ? The receding of colonial imperialism had not brought peace , riches , or liberty to the emancipated peoples ; instead , there were oppressions , corruption , and warfare , and a truculentmajority in the United Nations that was now not only antiAmerican , but anti-Americans like Gold . Vus nuch ? Medicaid ? Gold had another list . A symbiotic system of new criminal classes ; and medical science had created something infinitely worse , a long life span , with a larger and larger number of old people who were unneeded by society , had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer would grown children hope their parents going into surgery would come out alive ? What would Gold himself really feel the next time his father had an operation ? He knew about Sid and Rose and Esther , but he would not bet on himself or vouch for Muriel , or even Ida . Or Joannie , an alien mystery to him now , a distant cipher whom he understood best and knew least . The labor movement had come to its end in garbage strikes and gigantic pension funds invested by banks for profit . There seemed no plausible connection between cause and effect , or ends and means . History was a trash bag of random coincidences torn open in a wind . Surely , Watt with his steam engine , Faraday with his electric motor , and Edison with his incandescent light bulb did not have it as their goal to contribute to a fuel shortage someday that would place their countries at the mercy of Arab oil . Results attained were unrelated to objectives envisioned . Once , ten or fifteen years earlier , Gold had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Burroughs against charges of obscenity ; now there were massage parlors and pornographicmovies everywhere and newspapers and magazines on displaythat were obscene . The health club in the basement of the apartment house in which he had his studio had converted graduallyinto an elegant massage parlor : and his annual membership had been rudely terminated.  |p75And  when he 'd marched in Selma , Alabama , with Martin Luther King and campaigned so loyally against all forms of racial segregation , the thought never once crossed his mind that a day might come when his own neighborhood would alter for the worse and his own children be sent to costly private schools to evade the physical dangers of busing and integration and the decay in the quality of education offered by the public ones . They were not accustomed to being a white minority . Gold never doubted that racial discrimination was atrocious , unjust , and despicably cruel and degrading . But he knew in his heart that he much preferred it the old way , when he was safer . Things were much better for him when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did not touch on the virtue of the situation , but a fact nonetheless , that many people like himself who had worked and argued for the annihiliation of Jim Crow were those who would be least inconvenienced when they succeeded . Gold himself lived in a building with a doorman , and Negroes were not numerous in places he went to for the summer . Had they been , he would have sought new ones . When he came to realize this , he realized also that he was not just a liar but a hypocrite . A liar he knew he had been . Ida 's sixteen-year-old daughter was threatened with busing to a high school in a dangerous neighborhood in which she would be hated , where she could form no friendships , and in which she would be foolish to linger or wander , and only Ida 's sneaking influencewithin the Board of Education might save her : but only by the substitution of somebody else 's child . Gold was helpless to advise ; but he did feel that no law should force this upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the discordant elements of violence , crime , enmity , insurgence , and negation . With so much to be said on all sides of the question , he was sorry there was such a question . Solutions did not appear so readily as before , and things were not so clear as they once seemed . Things were just not working out as planned . Nothing ran smoothly . Nothingwas succeeding as planned . " Nothing Succeeds as Planned " was the title of Gold 's article , and he was not surprised that Lieberman published it immediately after ( fold had extracted the rest of the payment from him.  |p76RALPH  CALLED him at home the day after Gold mailed him four copies . " What did he say ? " Gold demanded hungrily . " Dina took the call , " said Belle , just returned from her afternoonjob as psychological counselor at a public elementary school . " He was calling from the White House , " Dina said . " What did he say ? " " And he sounded so nice . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " Must I break your head ? What did Ralph Newsome say ? " " He 'll call back tonight . You can take it in my room if you like . " Gold took the call in his study with the door closed . " God , Bruce , " Ralph began , " I ca n't tell you how you 're bogglingour minds . If nothing succeeds as planned  --  and you really present such a strong argument  --  then the President has just the excuse he needs for not doing anything . " Gold , though surprised , was nonetheless pleased . " I had n't looked at it in just that light , " he confessed . " We 're having photocopies made . We want everyone in government to read it , although we 've stamped it secret so nobody can . It would have been better , I suppose  --  " here Ralph 's voice dropped in gentle reproach  --  " if you had shown it to us first and the Presidentcould have introduced the proposition as his own . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as an authority . Do n't be surprised , Bruce , if he makes reference to it tomorrow . That should boggle minds . " " Has the President read it ? " Gold , with boggling mind , could not restrain himself from inquiring . " Oh , I 'm positive he has , " Ralph answered in his equable unhurriedmanner , " although I ca n't be sure . " " I would have shown it to him first , Ralph , but I did n't think anyone there but you would be interested . " " Bruce , I ca n't emphasize too strongly how high you rate with us . Especially after this . Nothing succeeds as planned  --  my God , what a concept . All of us want you working with us as soon as possible after the people above us decide whether they want you working here at all . Will you come ? "  | " As what ? " said Gold , who knew already the answer was ardentlyyes . " Oh , I do n't know , " said Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spokesman . " " A spokesman ? " Gold was abruptly doubtful . It sounded like something athletic . " What 's a spokesman ? " " Oh , Bruce , you must know . That 's what I 've been when I have n't been doing something else . A government spokesman , an unnamed spokesman , an administrative spokesman  --  it 's a little bit like a source . Have n't you been reading about me at all ? " " Oh , " said Gold quickly , defensively . " Now I know . " " I do get into the papers often . That 's one of the nice things about being an unnamed spokesman . In a month or two , we can move you up . " " To what ? " " Well , if nothing else , to a senior official . As a senior official , you 'd be free to hold background briefings any time you want , every time we schedule them . There 's no limit to how high you will go . Bruce , this administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " Gold sensed an innuendo at which he perhaps ought to take offense . " I 'm not very pushy , Ralph , " he said softly . " That will be a big plus for you , Bruce , that you 're not pushy . Like so many others . " " So many other what , Ralph ? " " So many others who are pushy , " Ralph went on with such uninterrupted affability that Gold concluded he had been unfairly sensitive . " Could you start immediately ? " " How much money would I make ? " " As much as you want , Bruce . No one comes to Washington to lose money . " Gold 's next question carried a twinge of pathos . " Would I have to be unnamed ? " " Just at the start . After all , if we want to use you as an unnamed spokesman , it would n't do if everyone knew who you were , wouldit " I guess not . "  | " Next week , why do n't you come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Up ? " said Gold , feeling a bit disoriented . " Oh , I 'm sorry . " Ralph laughed quietly . " I mean down . I 've been talking to so many legislators from the South I ca n't help feeling that they are the bottom of the world , and we 're the top . " Say , Ralph , that 's pretty good , " Gold told him . " I 'd like to use it in a piece , if you do n't mind . " Ralph was flattered . " Of course not , Bruce . But do n't use my name . You can imagine the trouble I 'd be in if I were quoted . " " Do n't worry , " Gold reassured him . " I 'd much rather present it as my own . " " On the other hand , " said Ralph , sounding touchy , " I would like some credit for it . After all , I did think it up . " " But how could I do that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for it in print if you do n't want your name men-tioned ? " The answer arrived in a second . " Could n't you say it came from a spokesman ? " " Sure . I could do that . " " Fine , Bruce . That will make all my families very proud . Andrea Conover blushed like a schoolgirl when I gave her your regards . She 'd love to see you again . " " When should I come ? " asked Gold . " I 'll phone you on Monday or Tuesday , or Wednesday , Thursday , or Friday . You know , Bruce , " Ralph pointed out , " the only daughter of Pugh Biddle Conover is no one to sneeze at . " Gold had no intention of sneezing at her . " WELL ? " BELLE studied him closely when he returned to the kitchen to finish his dinner . Dina watched him too . " I may have to go to Washington next week . They want my opinion about something . " Belle was no dope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be secret , " he admonished her again . Belle shrugged . " Who will I tell ? Your family ? "  |p79Dina  's face glowed . " I would tell Leo Lieberman . I bet that would make his father jealous . " " Suppose it falls through , " Gold asked , " and I get nothing ? " " I would tell them , " said Belle , " that you turned it down . " " That I refused to compromise my integrity ? " " Sure , " said Belle . " Me too , " vowed Dina . " Yes , " he admitted . " It 's about a government job . " Later that evening in their own room he said to Belle , " I thought you did n't want me to take a job in Washington . You said you would n't go . " Belle answered , " I 'm not going . " " You wo n't change your mind ? " " Absolutely not . " They slept in separate beds , with a night table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martini , feeling so consumedly braced he was almost offended that the woman with whom he was lunching was his sister . " Esther told me you 're writing a book about Jews , " said Joannie . Cold poached salmon would follow for Gold , with cucumber salad and green mayonnaise . They were lunching at the St. Regis and she would pay . She was a tall , suntanned woman with bright clothes , a springy figure , and hair expertly streaked . " Esther ? " " She calls about every two weeks , " said Joannie . " And has nothing to say . Jerry is n't happy about your book . " " Is that why you 're in New York ? " She shook her head . " He wants to know why you ca n't write a book about something else . " " I ai n't got that much choice , Joannie . " " Toni , " she corrected . " What 's he worried about ? " " We spend a lot of time in California trying to get each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons his family changed their name . " " To Fink ? " " It used to be Finkleman . Jerry gives a lot to both political parties . He thinks he 's got a good chance now of being a judge . " " Jerry 's not a lawyer , is he ? " " You do n't have to be a lawyer out there to be a judge , " Joanniep84explained . " At least that 's what they tell him when they come for money . " " You belong to every temple in lower California , " Gold derided . " That 's civic , not religious , " she countered . " We make it a point never to pray . " She picked without appetite at her small salad . " I saw Pop yesterday . " Gold was loath to ask . " How was he ? " " Quiet . " Her smile was rueful . " He still thinks it 's his fault I left home . He says you 're all trying to make him buy a condominium in Florida so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what Sid says . " " We 're seeing him tomorrow , " Gold said joylessly . He put his silver down and felt his face turn warm . " Jesus Christ , Joannie  --  " " Toni . " "  --  you do n't know what it 's like having him around . He thinks we 're still a family and he 's still the head . He bosses me around like I 'm a goddamned kid . I do n't have time to go to family dinners three or four times a week and neither does anyone else . We do n't like each other that much . We 've all got families of our own now and other people we want to see . You ought to have him out in California for a while . " " Jerry ca n't stand him . " " He knows that , " said Gold , in the same tone of protest . " Neithercan Gussie 's children , so they ca n't go to Richmond either . He ca n't just keep telling us whose house he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to drive him there and back and who else has to be invited . Christ , I think we 've seen more of each other the past few months than when we were all packed together in those five rooms over the tailor shop . Each year he comes up earlier and each year he stays later  --  this year for the Jewish holidays . Shmini Atzereth . Have you ever heard of it ? Neither have I. I swear he 's making his goddamned Jewish holidays up . Joannie laughed . " Do n't you think that 's funny ? " " No . And neither would you if you had to take so much of him and the crazy lady . "  | " Gussie is cute . " " She 's crazy as a loon . " " She 's sweet to me . And smart , too . " " She 's losing her marbles , " Gold sulked . " Both of them . Every time I see them they lose another marble . " " She gave me some good Southern advice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . If a married couple has no children , she said , they find themselves with nothing to talk about if they do n't have a dog . She also warned me not to sit facing each other when we 're eating home alone , and to avoid noisy foods , especially breakfast cereals that snap , crackle , and pop , and meats that require excessive chewing . " Her imitation was marvelously exact . " Well , " Joannie continued , her mood clouding , " we have no children and we do n't have a dog , so we 've got nothing to talk about but his real-estate and insurance business and all the people he does n't like . We sit opposite each other when we eat and are sick of staring into each other 's face . And he does make a godawfullot of noise when he chews , and I do too . If we did n't have a radio or television set blasting away at dinner and breakfast when we eat home alone I think we 'd both want to die . Dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gold was uncomfortable , hedged in suddenly by pity and embarrassment . She was still his kid sister . He bent forward and touched her hand with his index finger . " Listen , Joannie  --  " " Toni . " " Your name is Joannie . " " I changed it legally when I became an actress . " " Did you ever act ? " " I could n't . I 'd get jobs as a chorus girl sometimes , but I could n't dance . " " Stay for Rose 's birthday party Sunday . Come to the house . " She said no at once . " There 's someone in Palm Beach I want to see before I go back . I do n't like them in a crowd . I had dinner with Rose and Max and Esther last night , and I 'm meeting Ida later . I spoke to Sid . Muriel I can do without , but I telephoned her anyway . I think I slowed down her poker game . Is she any betterp86to Victor ? " Gold indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . " Gold was relieved to have his impression confirmed . " And Max 's speech is slurred . Did you notice that ? " " He drinks a lot during the day . Rose told me . " " He should n't be drinking at all , " Gold said with surprise . " She never told me . " " You probably never asked . She says it keeps him calm . " " He was always nice to us , " Gold remembered . " He was our first in-law . " " How would you feel , " Joannie asked , " if you had to work in a post office for over forty years and then found yourself scared because you would soon have to retire ? " " Not good , " admitted Gold . " And I 'd be drinking a lot more than I do . " " Lousy . God  --  neither one of them has ever had another job . That 's one of the reasons I got out of Coney Island so fast . I could n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I ran away with to go into beauty contests  --  her father was a shoemaker . Imagine having a father who 's a shoemaker or a tailor today . " " Did you ever win a beauty contest ? " " I 'd come in third or fourth . I was n't heavy enough . " " Did they mention the kids ? " " Do n't you ever ask ? " " That 's a subject we avoid . " " Norma 's in San Francisco living with a lay psychologist now , doing social work and still finishing her education , if you can believeher , and I do n't . They say Allen is a musician somewhere in Spain or North Africa , but you and I both know he 's a junkie and probably gay , although they do n't . One day soon a letter will come and we 'll all find out he 's dead . Rose thinks it may be because she went to work . She cried a little . Max too . " " That 's why I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it is n't her fault . The same thing happens to kids whose mothers do n't work . " " You ought to see them more , " Joannie said . " I do n't have that much to say to them . And Esther makes me nervous , ever since Mendy died . She clings . "  | " To what ? " " To nothing . She could go live with either one of her kids . They both want her . " " Not like us , " said Joannie . " Not like us . I wish she 'd marry that guy Milt . " " He has n't asked her . She also tells me , " Joannie said , " that you might be going to Washington to work in the government . " " That 's a long shot , I think . How will Jerry feel about that ? " " It depends . " Joannie responded pleasantly to his sarcasm . " If you get in the papers a lot , he 'll approve . Otherwise , he 'd rather brag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try to oblige , " Gold joked . " Tell Jerry not to worry about the book . Very few people read books and almost nobody reads mine . I certainly wo n't mention him and I 'll try not to use anyone like him as an example . " " How about me ? " " Jesus , I do n't know , Joannie  --  " " Toni . " " I 've got five sisters , one brother , three children , a wife , father , stepmother , and more in-laws and nieces and nephews than I can keep track of . It 's hard for me to deal with any subject without coming close to some of them . If I do they 're embarrassed , if I do n't they feel snubbed . My problem is that I 've got to write about the Jewish experience in America and I do n't even know what the Jewish experience is . Did Mom ever talk to you about sex ? " " I was only nine when she died . " " What 'd she die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Was it cancer ? " " I do n't think so . You better ask someone else . " " What about her neck ? She wore it bandaged a lot , did n't she ? " Joannie was unsure . " I do n't remember that . You 'll just have to ask . We were the two babies . If you want to know what my Jewish experience is , I can tell you . " Gold felt a chill blow through him . " It 's trying not to be . We play golf now , get drunk , take tennis lessons , and have divorces , just like normal Christian Americans . We talk dirty . We screw around , commit adultery , and talk out loud a lot about fucking . "  |p88Gold  drew back in horror . " I wish you would n't talk like that to me , " he chided her gently , almost pleading . " It makes me uncom-fortable . " " That 's part of your Jewish experience , " she said . " Do you screw around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I married Jerry , " she replied , and teased , " I do worse . I eat pork . "  |p89FROM  the very outset , Julius Gold had been distinctly aloof to the idea of a condominium . Gold wore a topcoat and muffler and put on leather gloves as Sid 's car pulled to a stop at the curb in Manhattan Beach . Harriet 's winter coat was buttoned to the neck . Her head was covered in a knitted cap pulled down over her ears . Sid carried a light raincoat . " Brrr  --  it 's cold , " said Gold . " Freezing , " said Harriet . " It 's turning icy . " " I do n't feel it , " said Gold 's father , with a vacancy of expression that was eloquent with disdain . Julius Gold was dressed in a baby-blue cardigan and a thin summer sport shirt . He padded about in velvet slippers of navy blue monogrammed in gold with two interwoven letters on each . " Maybe in the back it 's warmer , " he said without inflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house to the open sunlit porch . In one direction was a brilliant view of the sea . In the other was Sheepshead Bay , bobbing with moored charter fishing boats . The breeze that occasionally stirred was salutaryto the extreme . " Should I get you some blankets ? " offered Gold 's stepmother with exquisite kindness , seating herself on a bench . She wore a flat straw hat with colored cotton balls dangling from the wide brim and she looked gaily demented . Sid lay hack in a chaise and turned his face blissfully skyward . It was time to begin.  | " The city , " said Harriet , clucking in elegy . " It 's deteriorating rapidly . " " I have n't noticed , " said Julius Gold . " There 's lots of crime . " " Not around here , " said the game old man . " I ai n't been mugged once . " " In the subways , " droned Sid . " In the streets . " " We do n't go there . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Splendid , " answered his stepmother , who seemed to have it in only for him . " You may be wondering what it is I am knitting . It may be that I am knitting you an afghan . To keep you warm on frigid days like this . " Gold took off his coat . Harriet unbuttoned hers and removed her hat . " We would n't notice things like garbage , " Gold 's father elaborated . " We do n't have much . " " We eat so little , " said Gussie . " I got sons who take me out to lunch , " said Gold 's father . " And daughters who want me in their homes for dinner every night . " " Sometimes we 're too tired to go . " " Get them something to drink , " Gold 's father ordered Gussie . " Serve them in the chipped glasses , not me . " Sid asked for beer , Gold for club soda . Harriet would wait for tea . " Look at my two sons . " Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gold was basking in this compliment when his father added , " Hey , stupid  --  why do n't you put on some weight ? You look like a string bean . " Gold , reacquainted with his destiny , heaved a fatalistic sigh . " It 's the style now . Ai n't you heard ? " " People will think I ai n't got what to feed you . " " Ai n't there anything I can do to please you ? " " No . " With almost palpable reluctance Sid said , " I heard about this condominium . " He rose , wheezing , and chose a chair closer to his father . " It sounds like a good buy . "  | " In Lauderdale ? " " Hallandale . " " I like Miami Beach . " " There 's a good one there too . " " So ? " The old man fished in his pocket for a match for his cigar . " Buy it . " " I meant for you . " " For me ? " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject had not been broached before . " What are you bothering me with condominiums ? Go find me a good apartmentto rent . Like always . " " It makes more sense to buy your own home , Pop . " " My own home ? " His father 's voice was mocking . " How many acres ? " " Thirty-five thousand , " said Gold . " Do I have to share ? " " How many do you need ? You ai n't growing wheat , you know . " " No acres , Pop , " Sid resumed . " It 's an apartment in a building . But it 's yours and Gussie 's . You can stay in Florida as long as you want . Sid was perspiring now from more than the heat . " I stay there now as long as I want . And I 've got my money in blue chips . Why do n't you buy it ? " " I would , " said Sid , " if I lived in Florida . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's for a vacation I go . " In a milder tone , he said , " Well , Professor , what do you think ? " " I would do what Sid says . " " I 'll go look , " Julius agreed . " When ? " Harriet wanted to know . " When I go . It 's still warm . " " Pop , it 's turning cold , " Sid cajoled . " Two years ago you had pneumonia when you stayed to November . " " Bronchitis . " " It was pneumonia . " " It was flu . " " And it led to pneumonia . Pop , it 's a blue-chip investment , as good as gold . " At that moment the teakettle whistled . Harriet fol/lowed Gussie inside . " Pop , do n't tell Harriet , " Sid continued furtively . " But I 'll lay out the money . Try it . If you like it , buy it from me . If the price goes up , you get the profit . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you say ? " " That sounds fair , " was the old man 's conclusion . " But I 'll have to think it over . " Gold covered a laugh at Sid 's involuntary gasp . " Pop , " Sid pleaded , " we 've got to find a place for you . " " I got the money ? " " You got the money . " " Then I 'll do what you say , Sid , " Julius capitulated , with resignationand trust . Gold felt a twinge of compassion at the old man 's docility . " But first we got ta go look , do n't we ? We 'll go together ? " " We 'll go together , " Sid promised . " When ? " " Any time you say . When 's the graduation ? " Sid was bewildered . " What graduation ? " asked Gold . " Your daughter 's , dummy . " The women returned hastily , drawn by this outcry of contempt . " My favorite grandchild . Dina . You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In five years , " Gold told him with a steely voice . " If then . " " Do n't they change schools any more when they 're thirteen ? " " Not in private school . And this one may not make it that far . Your favorite grandchild ai n't exactly no ball of fire in class . " " In that case , " said his father , " we got ta go look . But I ai n't promising to buy . Sid , you name the day . We 'll go any time you say , after the holidays . " Vay'z mir , Gold grieved . Again the holidays ? " No , sirree , me and Gussie  --  we do n't like to get on no plane before the Jewish holidays . " Gold bolted from his chair . " What holidays ? " he demanded . " When is this Shmini Atzereth of yours , anyway ? " His father 's scrutiny was denigrating . " That was , already , you dope . A week ago , before Simchas Torah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now ? " " Shabbos Bereishes . " " Shabbos Bereishes ? " Gold was dumbfounded . Even in his own voice those words sounded unbelievable.  | " Sure , you skinny shaygetz , " his father began in a modulated tirade . " It 's what comes after Simchas Torah , you damned fool . This they want to work in Washington ? You did nothing Simchas Torah ? You wanted me to get on a plane before Simchas Torah ? You want me now to leave my family before Shabbos Bereishes ? Some sons I got . Ich hub dem bader in bud . " " I 'm not sure , " said Gold 's stepmother , " that I understand your local Yiddish . " " He has us both in the bath , " Gold translated tersely , and tried to ignore Sid , who was witnessing his chagrin with enormous mirth . " Pop , you 're an atheist , " Gold protested . " You would n't even let Sid and me be bar mitzvahed . " " But a Jew , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Jewish atheist . " " You would n't let Momma light candles Friday night . " " Sometimes I did . " " And now all of a sudden you know all the holidays . What is Simchas Torah ? What does Simchas Torah mean to you , anyway ? " " Simchas Torah , " his father answered coolly , " is when they finally finish reading the whole Torah in the temple . " " And what 's Shabbos Bereishes ? " " Shabbos Bereishes , " replied the old man , and drew on his cigar with a smile , " is when they begin again . " From Gold came a cry from the heart . " For how long ? " " A year , " said his father , flicking the ash from his cigar over the railing . " And when they finish , again comes  --  " " Shabbos Bereishes ? " " You said it , Goldy boy . But do n't you worry , " his father added and came to his feet with a jaunty spring . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na spend a year up here in this crummy city when I can buy a condominium in Florida ? You want me to invest in real estate ? I 'll invest in real estate . " " When ? " Harriet asked again . " After next Saturday . Shabbos Bereishes . It 's a promise . Let 's go eat now . Gussie , get my shoes . Change your hat . " Gussie returned in a creased felt hat with a broken turkey featherp94and she looked like Robin Hood . To Gold , the smell of the sea at Sheepshead Bay was a powerful call to clams on the half shell , shrimp , lobster or broiled flounder or bass . " Let 's go to Lundy 's , " he suggested . " It 's right here . We 'll have a good piece of fish . " " What 's so good about it ? " said his father . " So "  - -  - Gold declined to argue  --  " it wo n't be so good . " " Why you getting me fish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold . " White , " said his father . " White , " said Gold . " Black , " said his father . " Cold . " " Warm . " " Tall . " " Short . " " Short .

She glared at Sid , who was chuckling . Sid ignoredHarriet and winked at Gold companionably . " Sid , " Julius Gold said worriedly , walking with small , shuffling steps , as they neared the car , " you 'll tell the waiter , wo n't you ? Give him a big tip before . Let him know we 're important . Tell him all my life , even when I was poor , I never liked eating off no broken china . "  |p95GOLD  was tense as a wound spring the evening of Rose 's party , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first had even arrived . " I 'd like to make a toast , " said Gold 's father jovially . " To my host and youngest son . Sid said it ai n't nice to insult you in front of your wife and daughter , so I wo n't say nothing . " Everybody laughed but Gold . " You 'll really give up teaching ? " " In a minute . " " That feeling , I bet , is mutual . " His father leaned his head to the side in fascinated admiration of his own riposte and began to hum . " I 'm glad I 'm not in his class , " Harriet said cattily . " He flunks students , " Dina told her in awe . " Not any more , " said Gold . " It 's easier to pass them along and never have to see them again . " Gold congratulated himself on having set the bar up in the foyer . He tarried alone as long as he respectably could , then filled almost to the top a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single cube of ice . " IS N'T IT lucky , " mused Sid , as Gold strolled into the living room , " that we found ourselves on a planet where there 's water ? " Gold felt his chest turn to stone and watched the luscious slice of bronze-rimmed lake sturgeon on his plate alter for an instant into something as unappealing as a raw sardine.  | " Why ? " asked Victor . " Listen to Sid when he talks about water , " directed Gold 's fatherdrowsily . " If there 's one thing Sid knows , it 's water . " Gold glanced at his father but found no evidence of complicity . He shifted his fork from the sturgeon to a mound of red caviar . He was confident he could count on Ida , even Irv , to trap Sid on this one , to argue that we did not " happen " to find ourselves on a planet with water but would not have evolved as a species had there been none . " Otherwise , " Sid answered Victor , savoring first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rounded wedge of soft brown pumpernickel , " we would all be very thirsty . " He looked toward Gold with a challenging smile and continued with disarming ease . " After a big meal of turkey , or steak , or roast beef , or lobster , not only would n't we have water to drink , we would n't even have soda . Or tea or coffee . Because they 're all made from water . " And where , Gold wondered , would the turkeys and steak and roast beef come from , you shithead ? And the lobsters , with no water ? He waited for Ida to eviscerate Sid . But Ida , he saw with a shock , was listening as raptly as Milt , Max , and the rest . Those black militants in her school district had a point , Gold decided : Get her the fuck out . Sid forged ahead boldly , testing Gold 's self-discipline to the maximum . " We would have to drink wine or beer instead , " he commented , placing half a hard-boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beer are made from grapes and hops , " he explained . " And we 'd probably have plenty of grapes and hops , I bet . " Gold was not altogether certain what , anatomically , a gorge was , but he knew that his was rising . He had waited too long . He knew from experience the arsenal of retaliations Sid held ready for any contradictions from him . Delivered with an unctuous humility that could kill , they might range from a hurt and affecting " So I made a small mistake , " to a proud " See what a college education can do ? " The others would not find credible for a second the charge that all Sid 's errors were diabolically intentional . Gull feigned insouciance . Having taken a vow of silence , he kept it.  |p97And  Sid settled back with an air of victory , finished the last hors d'oeuvre on his plate , and began cracking walnuts from one of the heaping bowls set out by Belle for adornment now and nibbling later . The crisis past , Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitously to the attraction of chopped liver , and spooned smoked oysters and more red caviar onto his plate as well , then added a slice of cheese and another slice of sturgeon and some cold shrimp . He went to the bar for more bourbon . Max , his drooping cheeks red , was drinking Scotch for the occasion , while abstemiously avoiding everything else so far except some sliced carrots and a few buds of raw cauliflower . When Gold returned to the living room , Sid said , " It 's really a miracle , is n't it , when you think of it . So many planets  --  six or seven or eight  --  how many planets are there now , Bruce ? " Forty-two . " " Forty-two planets , " Sid continued with no change of expression . " And this is the only one with water . " " It 's a lucky thing , " said Victor , " that we found ourselves on this one . " " 1 feel sorry for all those people on the other planets , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there people on other planets ? " asked Ida . " If there are , " said Sid , " I 'll bet they sure are thirsty . " ROSE HAD been flabbergasted when she 'd arrived with Max and Esther and found the others present for her party . Immediately she began to cry . She was laughing as well and trying to talk above her own uproar in a voice that quickly grew hoarse . " Oh , Belle ! Belle ! " Again and again she flung herself upon the shorter woman in a grateful and crushing embrace . Max was beaming , his carewornface reflecting greater happiness than Gold could associate with him since the days of his engagement and marriage . Gold was dumbfounded by Rose 's reaction and stirred with a tenderness foreign to him . Rose was a large , wide woman . He could not remember her laughing , crying , or talking so freely . At the death and funeral of Mendy , Esther 's husband , she had wept noiselessly , andp98was still doing all she could to bolster Esther in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in rejoicing , was all at once the face of an aging woman . Esther looked still older . Sid looked younger than both , and all three were starting to resemble each other eerily , their dissimilar faces collapsing into old age along the same predestined patterns of decline . Someday he would look like them too . All but Joannie were present , even Muriel , who had set aside still another grudge against Ida and sacrificed a poker evening with her South Shore Long Island friends . Muriel had always been embitteredand self-centered  --  the farbisseneh one , his mother would say , an observation made more in woe than reprimand . Gold guessed she 'd been quarreling with Victor again on the drive into Manhattan . Gold harbored suppositions about Muriel that he preferrednot to enlarge upon . Gold had lain with too many married women to be blind to all signs . The main courses were turkey and roast beef . Had Ida or Harriet been hostess , there would have been a ham as well . Two large sections of prime rib had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spontaneous gift . Everyone agreed that Belle and Harriet cooked the best roast prime rib of beef in all creation . Not for them the bland juices of the Anglo-Saxons . They knew what to do with garlic , paprika , salt , and onions . Harriet came with two deep dishes of the mashed sweet potatoes and marshmallows that Gold adored , two crumb coffeecakes , a cranberrymold , and one bottle of sparkling domestic wine . Always at family gatherings now , the women , excepting Gold 's stepmother , vied or cooperated in the preparation of certain foods they made  --  or thought they made  --  uniquely well , and were encouraged  --  or presumed they were encouraged  --  to bring to the brunches , lunches , and dinners served at the homes of the others . With so many women at work , friction was inevitable and hurt feelings the rule . Harriet excelled at baking and was forever miffed upon arriving with two or three of her cheesecakes , moist chocolate cakes , or coffeecakes to find a deep-dish fruit pie , cookies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , atp99Muriel 's or Ida 's , two specially ordered gateaux St. Honore , alongsidewhich all other efforts necessarily paled . Esther specialized in stuffed derma and noodle puddings ; living alone now , she was expanding into potato and cheese blintzes and experimenting with dishes other than derma , unaware that with chopped liver and stuffed cabbage she was encroaching upon Ida 's traditional territoriesand that with chopped herring she was transgressing against Rose , who was unmatched in the family with all edible things from the sea , as well as with soups , matzoh balls , and other varieties of dumplings . Rose suffered the unintended affront in silence , Ida chafed vocally , Esther shuddered in repentance . No one would contend with Belle at icebox cake . Nothing was more humiliating to one than to telephone with an offer to bring something and be told the assignment had been delegated to another . Muriel , the youngest of the sisters still in the East , concentrated on gourmet variations of standard , sometimes canned , American foods  --  tuna fish , either in a crepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chicken salad with capers and fragrant herbs ; salmon mousse ; and a specialty of hers nobody had quite taken to yet , Jewish cornedbeefhash made with almost no potatoes and with hamburger meat and tomatoes rather than corned beef , which looked , even before the ketchup she insisted be added , like a monstrous scarlet meatloaf . Muriel often added minced anchovies to coleslaw and saladsshe bought . Ida hated anchovies and staunchly maintained theymade her want to vomit . Muriel would tell her to go ahead . Murielfrequently wondered aloud whether Ida 's and Irv 's combined incomestotaled more than Victor 's , assumed her question was itsown proof , and took it for granted that Ida was therefore lording itover her . Ida 's children were college-oriented . Muriel 's daughterswere not : instead they were prodigies of inside knowledge aboutdesigner-labeled dresses , shoes , pocketbooks , and luggage . It wasIda , typically , who first detected that all Muriel 's dishes for herfamily were built on basic ingredients that were cheap in the marketplaceor , because of Victor , free . To the everlasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever attempted to serve him stuffed breastof veal . There was unofficial agreement in the family that Rose wasthe best-natured , Esther the slowest-minded , Harriet the least so/ciable now , Ida the pickiest , Belle the most dependable , and Muriel the most selfish . Joannie was best-looking , although this rarely was mentioned . Muriel , who wore large bracelets and rings , had arrived at the party with yet another of her scarlet meat loaves of cornedbeefhash to add to the turkeys and standing ribs of beef already there . And all but Gold 's stepmother would have to eat some with cries of ecstasy or risk inciting Muriel to sniffs of disparagement for Esther 's noodle pudding or Ida 's Swedish meatballs , and to the reiterated charge that others in the family had always plotted against her . With Ida born just ahead , and Gold just behind , Muriel , sandwiched between these two achievement-powered phenomena , had not experienced the privileges of youngest child long enough to know there were any . " Dinner , " said Dina . " And I brought nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Max consoled her . " It was a surprise , " scolded Ida . GOLD WAS in for another blow in the dining room , for Belle had given to Esther copies of Lieberman 's magazine , and Esther had just finished laying one out at every second plate , the pages open to the title page of " Nothing Succeeds as Planned " with the repulsivedark portrait Lieberman always used because he had purchasedit years before from some scrounging , alcoholic illustrator for only twelve dollars and eighty-five cents . When Gold beheld the magazines , he knew what it was to wish , literally , to fall through a floor . His head reeled and he clasped with both hands the back of his chair as he felt his knees buckle . Oh , Esther , you poor benighted fool , he mourned in pity and forgiveness . He dropped his eyes from her blissful face and snow-white hair as a troubled murmuring rose about his ears . " It 's another story by Bruce , " Esther repeated to all who grunted inquisitively . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standing ovation only because Esther was standing while she clapped her hands . Her mouth was trembling with an uncommon palsy that seemed to shake her lower jaw now and again and that gave to her chalky face an appearance of heightened shyness . Many of herp101lower teeth were part of a bridge . It was with a discerning air of protectiveness that old Milt glanced from Gold to Esther and took a loyal position beside her . " Is n't that nice ? " Rose applauded too . Belle , catching Gold 's eyes , offered a helpless shrug . Dina lingered evilly instead of escapinginto her room as prearranged . " Another screw , " explained Gold 's stepmother to Gold 's father , " has come loose . " And another marble , Gold replied to himself , has rolled out of your fucking skull . Some at the table had already overshot the pages of his article and were engrossed in the sexual help wanted ads at the back . " And after dinner , " said Esther , " he 'll autograph all our copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gold begged . " You 're embarrassing me . " " And then , " Esther went on , finally sitting down , " we 'll all have to go home and read it . " " Fat chance , " said Harriet . " Will someone pass me some turkey ? " said Gold . " We 'll have to buy another bookcase soon , " said Muriel . " Where 's an ashtray ? " Ida , shorter , scowled up at her and fanned the air free of cigarette smoke . " At least he 's closer to the front this time , " she noticed . " You get more money for that ? " asked Irv . " For what ? " Gold 's words were clipped . " For being near the front ? " " No , " said Belle . " He gets paid ? " asked Victor . " Yes , " said Belle . " Victor , take some roast beef . Everybody start eating . Please . " " There 's plenty of everything at both sides of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliced rye bread with black seeds directly under Gold 's nose . " Take some bread , Brucie . It 's your favorite kind . " " I thought you told us to stop calling him Brucie when he turned twenty-one , " Muriel corrected Ida . Gold declined the rye bread with a shake of his head . The aro/matic burnt allure of those black seeds nearly split his heart in two . He would forgo the roast potatoes too , butter-yellow with charred pan burns and darkly flecked with succulent particles of shriveled , greasy onion embodying now the concentrates of all those piquant seasonings that had blended together with the flavor of prime rare beef . Self-denial , like the self-punishment of jogging , made him feel virtuous and savagely bad-tempered . " I just do n't get it , " said Max in thoughtful doubt . " This title , I mean . " " In my opinion , " ventured Dina , " it 's a big mistake . " She was eating off her plate as she stood . Having asserted all week that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it impossible to tear herself away . " Sure , " said Milt . " A mistake . What you meant to say , I think , was that nothing succeeds like success . Right ? " " No , " said Belle . " What I meant to say , " said Gold , slipping into the plush conversationalrobes of the pedagogue-prophet , " is that nothing succeedslike failure . If you take the long view , the only outcome we can ever rely upon is failure . " " I ca n't afford to take a long view , " said his father . " I 'm a very short person . " " Would you care to elaborate on that , Professor ? " asked Sid , his mouth full . " If you 'd take the trouble to read it , " Gold began , chewing . " Oh , Daddy , " interrupted Dina , " no one 's going to read it . " " Dina , will you get the hell out of here already , if you 're going ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle , in adiversionary alarm . Like earth-moving equipment , arms reached forth over the table simultaneously for helpings of Esther 's noodle pudding . " Nobody 's settled my hash , " said Muriel . " And I brought nothing , " lamented Rose . " Harriet takes the cake , " said Belle . " And Belle chimes in , " Ida said . And now Dina fled . " Are you telling me , " questioned Irv , holding at a stop the dishp103of mashed sweet potatoes Gold awaited , " that if I set out to drill a patient 's tooth to put a filling in , I have n't succeeded ? " Gold was indulgent . " Irv , you ai n't filling teeth because you like to drill holes . If you fill a tooth to make money to buy a car that 's going to conk out on you tonight in the tunnel going back to Brooklyn , you have n't really succeeded in what you planned , have you ? " " That 's kind of farfetched , Bruce , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about drilling teeth . Will you pass those sweet potatoes ? " " I think fairness requires , " said Ida , " that we all read the article before we form an opinion . " " That will be the day , " said Harriet . " And I 'll believe he 's going to Washington when I see it . " " Harriet , will you please shut up ? " Gold pleaded . " For once ? " Harriet said to Sid , " I always told you he was spoiled . " " Not by me , " bragged Muriel . This statement was superfluous . Muriel had accepted Victor 's proposal of marriage , her first from anyone , after working as a salesgirl in Macy 's for eight months , and had not thought of spoiling anyone but herself , since . " Bruce was n't spoiled . " Ida 's celerity in coming to Gold 's defensewas always sufficient to leave him feeling undermined . " He was given advantages because he showed he would make the most of them . Like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because he writes things nobody understands . " Gold 's cheeks were afire with escalating anger . " Irv , will you pass those goddamn sweet potatoes , please ? " He speared a slice of roast beef . " Victor , throw some corned-beef hash on my plate , will you ? And two of those roast potatoes , with onion , onion . Ida , give me a couple of slices of that bread . " Victor , pleased to comply , said , " She made the corned-beef hash with filet mignon . " Gold was starving and had no appetite . If I ever marry again , he despaired . . . and was interrupted by his father , who coughed to command attention , leaned toward him angrily , and declared : This thing that you did was an insult with this guy to me and the whole family . He was rich ? "  |p104Gold  was flabbergasted . " What thing ? " " With this guy . " His father 's face was stern . First Gold blinked . Then he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father began in a harangue . " Do n't ask me which one . I 'll give him which one , that idiot . You went to school with him , did n't you ? " " Lieberman ? " " Who else , you cartoon ? I have to tell him which one . " Victor giggled , and Sid was regarding the assault upon Gold with a smiling and benign countenance . " How come  --  " and here Julius Gold adopted a pose of elegance and bent his head far back for no better purpose , it seemed , than to look horizontally past his knob of a nose  --  " how come they lived in Coney Island if they were so rich ? " Gold was puzzled . " They were n't rich . " " His father was better than me ? What did he do ? " " He candled eggs . He was in the egg business . " " I owned factories , " Gold 's father maintained . " I built gun turretsin the war for the Bendix people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding . " They gave me once a small citation for efficiencybecause I had a small factory . I had a coat business and was in real estate . I had a leather business from which I was able to retire with an income . Ask Sid . Long ago I was in furs , spices , ships , import and export . " His look grew distant and he seemed to be maundering . " Once 1 owned a fine apartment house in a bad neighborhood , but the banks took it back from me . I owned tailor shops , always the same one , but it was hard to make a go , so I kept getting out . I had a big grocery store on Mermaid Avenue before it closed . I was ahead of my time with my supermarket . Once I owned a store with surgical appliances for people with operations , and I knew how to talk  --  believe me , I knew what to say to people when it came to selling . Have I got an arm for you ! ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I would ask another . I was the best in the whole world , but I could n't make a living so I went into finance and was a commission man on Wall Street in the Depressionwhen no one could sell a single share of stock , not even me . I was in building , when no one was building . I was a draftsmanp105before anyone even knew what a draftsman was . A lot of people still do n't . " His eye fell upon Gold accusingly . " An egg candler is better than me ? " " Did I say that ? " " So how come , " said Julius Gold , " you work for him , and he do n't work for you ? " Now Gold understood . " I do n't work for him . I 'm a free-lance writer . He 's an editor . " His father appeared ominously pleased . " Did you write this or did he ? " " I did . " " Did he pay you or did you pay him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to me , " said his father with sovereign scorn . " Do you wish you was him , or do you wish you was you ? " " I wish I was me . " " Does he wish he was him , or does he wish he was you ? " " He probably wishes he was me . " " Sid ? " " He may be right , Pop . " " Ah , what do you know ? " said the old man , shaking his head at Sid in disgust . " You 're just as dumb , sitting there like a dope all these years with your laundry machines . Like American Tel and Tel , still with their telephones . You never had no plan . I told you a hundred times , you got to have a plan . " His father found a cigar . " By you , he may be right . By me  --  " his father struck his match  --  " money talks . The man who does the paying calls the tune . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a son of an egg candler yet when I built turrets for the Bendix people , and that 's it . Fartig . " " Oh , Pa , I 'm forty-eight goddamn years old , " Gold started to strike back angrily . " Do n't you swear . I never allowed such language in my house . " " It 's my house and I do . I 'm a college professor and have a Ph.D . I write books . I go on television . I get paid for making speeches at colleges and conferences . And you still talk to me like I 'm a child or some kind of imbecile . All of you ! There are people in Washington who want me to go there . "  | " As what ? " responded his father with a jeering laugh . " As a tourist , " joked Max , and Gold felt the fight go out of him . Oh , Max , Gold wailed silently , not you too . " To see the Washington Monument , " chortled Milt , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was starting to feel at home as Esther 's suitor . Inwardly Gold was close to tears . Soon , he reflected despondently , I will be making recommendations whether to bomb or not to bomb . Here I am hopeless . " Okay , you 're right and I 'm wrong , " he surrendered abjectly to his father , who nodded . " I wish we were talking about water again . " " Ask Sid , " said his father . " If there 's one thing Sid knows , it 's water . " Esther , obliging , asked , " Sometimes when I look out my window in winter , I see ice flowing up the river  --  why is that ? " " That 's because ice is lighter than water , " answered Sid , " and it 's floating up to get to the top of the river . " For an instant Gold was speechless . Blood rushed to his face . " Do you really think , " he demanded in a cold fury , " that the ice is flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is n't it ? " asked Sid . " Do you really think that up is up ? " Gold blurted out , pointing northward angrily . " Up is n't up ? " said someone . " Sure , it 's up , " said someone else . " What then , it 's down ? " answered still one more . " I meant north , " Gold corrected himself with a shout . " Do you really think that something is higher just because it 's north ? " Sid preserved a tranquil silence while others championed his cause . " Of course , it 's higher . They got the mountains there , do n't they ? " " That 's why people go in the summer . " " It 's cooler . " " North is always higher on the map , " Ida pointed out . " I 'm not talking about a map . " " That 's why the water always flows down to the middle of thep107map , " said his father with belittling arrogance . " Where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And I suppose , " Gold sneered at them all , " that if you took a map off the wall and turned it upside down , all the water would run off . " " Oh , no , silly , " said his sister-in-law . " There 's no water on the map . " " He thinks there 's water on a map . " " A map is only a picture . " " I know it 's a picture ! " Gold shrieked in fear . " I was being ironic . I was asking a question , not making a statement ! " " But turn the world upside down , " suggested Sid with an air of craftiness in the intimidated lull that ensued , " and then see what would happen . " " Nothing ! " roared Gold . " Nothing ? " said Sid . " The North Pole would be the South Pole , " said Muriel . " The Big Dipper would spill . " " We 'd go south to get cold . " " Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nothing . " " Nothing would happen ! " Gold heard himself screaming . " Uphill would still be uphill , God damn it , there is no top or bottomwhen it comes to planets , and I 'm leaving here right now and never coming back  --  what is it , what is it , what is it , what is it ? " he cried with shrill and perfervid impatience at whoever had been thumping him on the shoulder . " It 's for you , " said Dina . " What is ? " " The phone call . " Dina rolled her eyes upward in martyrdom . " It 's that man in the White House again . You can take it in my room . " The will to live left Gold . The delusion possessed him that Ralph and rulers in all the capital cities of the world had been witness to the disgraceful scene just completed . Television cameras had recordedit . Woodward and Bernstein would write a book . He was ruined.  |p108DINA  HELPED him to his feet . Ida steadied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen to Dina 's bedroom . " Ralph ? " " Just a minute , darling , " said a woman 's voice as warm and rich as flowing honey . " Bruce ? " " Ralph ? " " The President of the United States has definitely decided that he wants you to work with him , " said Ralph . " He will see you in the White House tomorrow morning at seven-thirty . You will have a chance to get to know each other . " " I ca n't come to the White House tomorrow morning , " Gold croaked . " I 've got a ten o'clock class . " " You 'll be back in time , " said Ralph . " The appointment is only for a minute and a half . If you leave for the airport now you can catch the last shuttle . " " I ca n't leave now . It 's my big sister 's birthday party . " " The President would send his own plane but his wife is using it to go shopping . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how . Ralph  --  will the President be angry if I do n't come tomorrow ? " " Not angry , Bruce . But very disappointed , although he wo n't know . I 'll simply put somebody else into that minute and a half and he probably will never notice the difference . " " I could come Wednesday , " Gold begged . " He 'll be in China . " " Will you please get off the phone ? " Gold 's daughter hissed from the doorway like the deadliest of adders . " I 'm expecting a call " " Get the fuck out of here , " he answered in kind with his hand muffling the phone , " or I 'll kill you . " Dina skipped merrily away . " They want him to come to Washington , " she sang out . " But come anyway , " Ralph decided , " and we 'll talk . Andrea will probably want you for dinner . Stay at an excellent hotel , in case you 're recognized . Unless , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as a guest . "  |p109Gold  waited without breath for five full seconds before saying he 'd stay at a hotel . In something of a stupor he returned to the dining room . " Was it really the President ? " asked Rose in a whisper . " And he wants him to come right away , " said Esther to Harriet , who was looking chastened . " An assistant , " said Gold . " The President has lots of assistants , " Harriet remarked churlishly . " Well , this is his best one , " Ida informed her . " I ca n't wait to visit Bruce in Washington , " said Muriel , shaking ashes from the cigarette jutting from her mouth , and Gold was stricken with something more numbing than dismay . " Maybe we can all go together , with the kids . " " That should be nice , " said Rose . " Wo n't it , Max ? " " Maybe he can get me a raise . " " Bruce , " Ida reprimanded him sharply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must tell you . Esther , Rose , Max , Irv , Muriel , Victor , and I all think you 're getting too thin . " " He was always too thin , " derogated his father . " I told him too thin  --  but he would n't listen . When he wears pajamas it 's only one stripe . " " What was it Sid used to tease him about ? " asked Emma Bovary . " Go out for the fencing team , " said Echo . " He was so skinny they 'd never be able to hit him . " " Remember the time they would n't let him sing in school and he came home crying ? " asked Natasha Karilova . " And how funny he looked in eyeglasses ? " responded Aurora with equal merriment , and Gold returned from his daze and realized he 'd been giving the names Emma Bovary , Echo , Natasha Karilova , and Aurora to his sisters Muriel , Ida , Rose , and Esther . " There were just too fucking many of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutally for the last remaining end piece of roast beef as Belle and a few of the other women began clearing the table . " When you going ? " demanded his father.  | " Wednesday , " grumbled Gold , and masticated seriously . " For how long ? " " He has a class on Friday , " said Belle . " You taking Belle with you ? " " No , " said Belle resolutely . " I have to work at the school Wednesday . " " It 's too soon for that , " said Gold . " What kind of job you getting ? " " I really ca n't tell you yet . You would n't like it anyway . " " Of course not . " " So let 's talk about something else . " " Sure , " Sid said . " Let 's talk about vultures . " Gold 's face froze . " Why ? " " They 're like the lilies of the field . " " Sid , you bastard  --  " " Apologize ! " screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard , for that filthy word you just said . " Gold walked into the kitchen . Rose was bawling again . " I ca n't help it , " she explained to Ida . " It 's the first party I ever had . " " Rose , what do you mean ? " Ida said . " We were always having birthday and Christmas parties . " " Even I had them , " Gold recollected . " I was the one who made them , " Rose exclaimed joyously , with another outburst of tears . Esther nodded . " Poppa was always busy and Momma was alwaysworking and sick a lot . So Rose was the one who made the parties . " " And Esther helped , " said Rose . " But I never had one for my-self . " " I thought it was about time , " said Belle , carrying a cup of coffee to Rose . " Happy sixtieth . " Gold had difficulty swallowing . " Rose , " he said , clearing his throat , and took coffee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember the time Sid lost me and you had to come to the police station to get me ? " " Not me . I was selling custard and malteds on the boardwalk . Esther went . "  | " Boy , was there hollering in the house that night , " said Sid , taking , as he entered , a bite-size piece of Danish pastry . " I told them you ran away . " Gold was staggered . " How could you do such a thing ? " " Listen , I was the oldest , " laughed Sid . " It was n't so much fun taking care of all of you . I used to like girls , remember ? " He cast a glance backward to assure himself of Harriet 's absence . Ida understood . " I never liked it when I had to take Muriel and Bruce to school . " " I never liked it when I had to take care of Bruce , " said Muriel . And Gold had not enjoyed having to take care of Joannie . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Maxsaid grouchily . " Nothing . " " I do n't care . " Rose nullified his grievance with a good-natured toss of her hand . " They did n't even know . Listen , I 'm so old I 'm glad they let me stay . " " That 's why I 'm afraid to go looking for a job , " said Esther , and those nerves in her jaw were quivering again , giving to her meticulouslyclean chin the look of something easily broken . " Remember how hard it was when we started ? " Rose sipped her coffee . " I guess we had lots of fun even then . It took me two years to find a steady job . " " I found one sooner when I got out of high school , " said Esther . " You were so pretty , " said Rose . Esther 's eyes misted over . " But I was always big as a horse , " Rose went on . " Boy , was it hard . Jobs were scarce then , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Jews should apply . " " I was one of the first Jews in the Post Office , " boasted Max dolefully . " Victor 's older brother was one of the first Jewish cops , " said Muriel . " The rest were all anti-Semitic . That 's why he quit and went into the meat business . " " Every morning , " said Rose , " the four of us , me and my friends Gertie , Beatie , and Edna , would go into the city to look . We were only eighteen . We would have to go to the agencies mainly , because they were the ones who had jobs to give , and they took a nice percentage of the pay . It was not an easy time for Jews , what with first the Depression and then Ilitter and all those anti-Semitesp112here , and one big agency , I forget the name but they would let us wait around all day so we 'd have a place to stay , would every once in a while announce that all Jews could go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All we even wanted was part-time work or a temporary job . So after that whenever I filled an application with an agency I would put down Protestant . I did n't even know what Protestant was but I knew it was good . They all knew I was lying , with my looks , but they did n't really care . At least then they could send me out . At one of the employment agencies I finally got a temporary job for three weeks . Some job . The interviewer at the department store told me she knew I was Jewish . But she gave me the job anyway . Maybe she could n't get anyone else to take it . The store was all the way in Newark , New Jersey , but it paid five dollars a day . It cost ten cents each way for the trolley and the train to go into the city and maybe a quarter more for lunch and a drink in the afternoon . It cost me an extra nickel each way to go into New Jersey with the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day but most of the time she would n't take it all . She 'd put some of it in my drawer for me to save . " Rose , Gold reflected , was already ten years older than Momma had lived . " Sid was working at the Brighton Laundry with all those horses he was afraid of . Remember those horses , Sid ? " " I sure do . Watch out for those horses , ' Mom would tell me every time I left the house . " She worried all day long , " Rose remembered . " Where does a Jew come to a horse ? ' she 'd say , and shake her head so miserably . She worried about me too every day until I got home . It took me two hours to get to Newark from Coney Island and I had to stand in the department-store window and display some kind of a brush and mop with wax . It was a real bad day for me from the first one on , because people would stop and look . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being paid for . Then I remembered we had relatives in Newark , most of Momma 's family lived in New Jersey , and I was so ashamed that one of them would pass and see me . I worked all day with my heart in my mouth . But five dollars a day was a lot of money then and would pay for a lot of new days of looking for work when that job ended . When I mopped I could do it with my hack to the window hilt with thep113brush I had to look out at the street . I still do n't know if any of them saw me but I was so afraid . I can still remember the lunch all four of us had every day we went into the city to look for work . There was a big cafeteria on West Forty-second Street . I think the name of it was the Pershing . Every day we ordered one order of corned-beef hash and four coffees . " " Was it as good as mine ? " asked Muriel . Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was awful . We hated corned-beef hash , not yours , but it was the only thing that could be divided in four easily and was cheap and filling . We would all chip in for a pack of cigarettes and take five each . Then after lunch we would split up in twos and stand on the employment lines at the department stores or go back to the employment agenciesto wait . There was Civil Service , but we did n't think we were smart enough or that they had any jobs we wanted . All we knew was typing and salesgirls . And we did n't want to leave home . In those days people did n't want to move away . " Gold remembered her two children with a pang . But Rose , in the momentum of narration , was oblivious to the connection . " So we kept looking and then I got , before the law office , a job in one of the stores on Fourteenth Street , Hearn 's . Selling behind the counter , and would probably still be there yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pincher , and this used to kill me and the other girls too . So we made up and stood in a bunch one day and when he came squeezingthrough with his hands down I stuck a pin in him . He never knew who did it , but I felt he did or would find out and I was so afraid I knew I could n't stay there so I left when Momma said it was all right and began looking again . We walked miles all over the city every day just to save an extra five cents in carfare , but we were a happy bunch and had fun , corned-beef hash and all , and I made myself a promise one day that if I ever found a decent steady job I was never going to leave it , so when I found this steno job at the law firm , I stayed , and I 've been there all this time . I never wanted to have to go looking for a job again . " " Forty-two years , " Max sulked , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start new girls out now at almost the same salary she 's making . " " I do n't care , " Rose answered heartily . " They let me leavep114when I had the babies and let me work part time when I had to . I 'm still afraid they 're going to make me leave , and I 'll have to go looking again . " " Now ? " Max scoffed . " Now you would n't have to . " " I just hope I can stay until you can retire too . Maybe then wecan get a condominium in Florida also , near Poppa and Gussie . " " Are in-laws allowed ? " asked Irv , pushing through . " I wantsome coffee too . " Belle shooed them all outside the kitchen . When Dina , flanked by Esther and Belle , carried in the birthday cake , Gold felt like crying and feared he might run from the room . He was thankful the lights had been darkened for all those flickering candles . An extra one had been added for good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly , as all made ready to depart and she came to kiss him goodbye . " She was always the best one . She never gave me a minute 's trouble . " " So fucking much in character , " Gold grumbled . " To judge the whole human race by how much trouble we gave him . " She was also the one who had gotten least . Even Esther had fared better : little Mendy , though scrappy and opinionated , had been devoted to Esther and had left money at his death two years earlier , and both her children , one in Boston and the other in Philadelphia , were upset that she still chose to live alone near Rose rather than with one or the other of them . There were more large presents than Rose and Max could handle . Iry and Victor helped pack them , while Gold went back and forth for shopping bags . To Muriel 's gift of a marked-down alligatorpurse Victor had added a dozen shell steaks and a pickled tongue . The grandest prize in the bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid had paid most but all had chipped in and therefore Sid could tell Harriet that the present had come from the family . The Caribbean would be warm , whereas Europe would remind them of their son and California of their daughter . Neither Rose nor Max had ever been out of the country . They had not even been on a plane . " I sure get a kick , " Iry said to Gold , " out of the way you guys kid each other along . "  |p115Gold  was appalled . Ho-ly shit . Was that the way they saw it ? " You three are a riot , " Milt agreed . By the time they were leaving , with all of the women but his stepmother and Muriel having pitched in , the dining room and kitchen had been cleared and the last pan scrubbed , and the last load of dishes was already groaning in the dishwasher . Gold , when a final worried hush fell , was able to allay their deepest fear and send them away in a mood of jubilation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door , while the others waited with glummest concern , " if you go to Washington , you would n't ever do anything to make us ashamed , would you ? " Gold was almost afraid to inquire . " Like what ? " Here Esther 's courage failed , and others took over . " Like ever vote Republican ? " " Never , " he answered . " Or help one get elected ? " " Of course not ! " " Not even if he was Jewish ? " " Especially . " " Thank God , " said his stepmother . " That Aunt Rose , " said Dina , sitting cross-legged on Belle 's bed . " I never saw her so happy . Did you ever hear her laugh and talk so much ? " " I 'm glad I made the party , " Belle said . So was Gold . Belle was a good wife , and Gold guessed he might miss her if he ever decided he wanted one.  |p116EVERYTHING  in Ralph Newsome 's office in Washington had a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been greeted at the elevators by a young girl with a pretty face who turned him over to a stunning woman near thirty with straight black hair and a sheer , very expensive dress that clung bewitchingly to her incrediblysupple figure , who conducted him at length to Ralph 's secretary , a sunny , flirtatious woman of arresting sensual warmth who won his heart instantly with her seductive cordiality and caressing handshake . Everything in view gleamed with a polished intensity that made electric lighting , on these premises , seem superfluous . Ralph had aged hardly at all . He was tall and straight , with languid movements , freckles , and reddish-brown hair parted on the side . What Gold remembered most clearly about Ralph was that he never needed a haircut or ever looked as though he 'd had one . He wore a tapered , monogrammed shirt and his trousers looked freshly pressed . He was still , somehow , the only graduate of Princeton University Gold  --  or anyone Gold knew  --  had ever met . " I hope you had fun last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting with good-looking women who will do almost anything for a good time . " Gold curtly answered , " I was tired when I got in . I wanted a rest . " This was a lie . Rather , he had spent the evening roaming dismallyfrom one public room of his hotel to another , hoping in vain that someone might recognize him and take him somewhere elsep117to girls as lovely as any one of the three who 'd just welcomed him . " Gosh , Bruce , I 'm happy to see you again , " Ralph said . " It 's just like old times again , is n't it ? " Gold was silent . It was not at all like old times . " The President will be pleased I 'm seeing you today , if he ever finds out . You sure do boggle his mind . He has a framed copy of your review of his My Year in the White House under the glass top of his desk in the Oval Office so he can reread it all day long during vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , education , and welfare , and other mattersin which he has no interest . " Ralph was in earnest . " I 'm told he already has a blowup of your proverb Nothing Succeeds as Planned ' on a wall of his breakfast room right beside a quotationfrom Pliny . It 's a daily reminder not to attempt to do too much . " Gold was guarded in his reply . " I 'm glad , " he said and hesitated . " There 's still much about his book I do n't understand . " " That 's one of the things he likes best about your review . He was afraid you might see through him . " " See through him ? " Gold shifted his feet uneasily . " Well , we all knew he really did n't have much to write about his one year in the White House , especially since he was so busy writing about it . He probably wants you here as soon as you can make the necessary arrangements , although he probably does n't want you making any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what ? " asked Gold . " As anything you want , Bruce . You can have your choice of anything that 's open that we 're willing to let you have . At the moment , there 's nothing . " " Ralph , you are n't really telling me anything . Realistically , how far can I go ? " " To the top , " answered Ralph . " You might even start there . Sometimes we have openings at the top and none at the bottom . I think we can bypass spokesman and senior official and start you higher , unless we ca n't . You 're much too famous to be used anonymously , although not many people know who you are . Got anything else in the works ? "  | " I 'm doing a book for Pomoroy and Lieberman and there 's a short piece on education I have in mind . " " How I envy you , " Ralph murmured . Gold eyed him with hostility . " What 's the book about ? " The question gripped Gold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about Jewish people . " " I gather you 're in favor . I would rush that one out while there 's still time . " " Still time for what ? " " Still time to risk it . The article on education should help . We 'll be organizing another Presidential Commission on education soon and you 'll be appointed . " Ralph buzzed his intercom . " Dusty , darling , bring in our file on Dr. Gold , will you ? " " Sure thing , honey . " The beautiful woman gave Ralph a folder containing a pad on which was written absolutely nothing . " Here you are , sweetheart . " " Thanks , love . " " She 's gorgeous , " said Gold , when she left . " And Dusty is an exciting nickname . " " That 's her real name . Her nickname is Sweets . " " You did n't call her Sweets . " " In a government office ? " Ralph chided benevolently . " Now , let 's see where we are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , source , and senior official . " We considered beginning you as a press aide , but one of the first things the boys from the press would want to know would be where does someone like you come off being a press aide . Would you like to work as a secretary ? " " It 's a far cry from what I had in mind , " said Gold stiffly . " I ca n't type . " " Oh , not that kind of secretary , " Ralph laughed . " I mean  --  " he groped  --  " what do you call it ? The Cabinet . You would n't have to type or take shorthand . You 'd have girls like Dusty and Rusty and Misty to do that for you . Would you like to be in the Cabinet ? " Gold was more than mollified . " Ralph , is that really possible ? " " I do n't see why not , " was Ralph 's reply . " Although you might have to start as an under . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit over a deputy and assistant , I think , but not yet an associate . Unless it 's the other way around . Nobody seems sure any more . " " Could I really begin as an undersecretary ? " " In Washington , Bruce , you rise quickly and ca n't fall very far . How would you like to be Secretary of Labor ? " Gold , on firmer ground now , hesitated deliberately before evincingrepugnance . " I think not . " " I ca n't say I blame you . How about Secretary of the Interior ? " " That sounds rather dark . " " I believe they work with coal mines . Transportation ? " Gold made a face . " That smacks of labor . " " Commerce ? " " It sounds a little bit like peddling . " " You 're showing excellent judgment . What about Ambassador to the U.N. ? " " Do n't make me laugh . " " What do you think about Secretary of the Treasury ? " Gold pricked up his ears . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What would I have to do ? " " I think I could find out . Harris Rosenblatt would know . Most of them are very rich and seem to care about money . " " I care about money . " " But they know about it . " Gold declined with regret . " I 'm not sure I 'd be comfortable . I'msupposed to be something of a pacifist and a radical reformer . " " But a conservative radical reformer , Bruce , " Ralph reminded . " That 's true . " " Imagine what a blessing it might be to have you in the Departmentof Defense . " Gold had an inspiration . " How about Secretary of Defense ? " " That 's good , Bruce . Especially for a pacifist . " " But I 'm only a pacifist in times of peace . " " We 'll put it clown . " Ralph added to his list . " And then there 's head of the FBI or ( ' IA to consider . "  | " Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe so and wrote those down too . " These are all good , Bruce . Someone with your flair for publicity could probably get your name in the newspapers almost as often as the Secretaryof State . " " What about Secretary of State ? " asked Gold . " That 's a thought , " said Ralph . " Would n't I have to know anything ? " " Absolutely not , " Ralph answered , and appeared astounded that Gold even should ask . " In government , Bruce , experience does n't count and knowledge is n't important . If there 's one lesson of value to be learned from the past , Bruce , it 's to grab what you want when the chance comes to get it . " Gold asked with distress , " Is that good for the world ? " " Nothing 's good for the world , Bruce . I thought you knew that . You 've more or less said the same in that last piece of yours . Now , Bruce , " Ralph continued awkwardly , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better wife . " " Than Belle ? " Gold was elated . " I 'm sorry . " Ralph was solemn . " Belle would be okay for Labor or Agriculture . But not for Secretary of State or Defense . " " Belle and I have not been close , " Gold confided . " In that case I 'm happy , " said Ralph . " Try someone tall this time , Bruce . You 're rather short , you know . It would add to your stature if you had a tall wife . " " Would n't a tall wife make me look smaller ? " inquired Gold . " No , " said Ralph . " You would make her look taller . And that would add more to your stature and make her look smaller . Andrea Conover would be perfect . " " I 'm seeing her tonight . Is she tall enough ? " " Oh , easily . And her father is a dying career diplomat with tons of money and the best connections . Propose . " " Tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen her for seven years . " " So what ? " Ralph laughed back in encouragement . " You can always get a divorce . Andrea 's doing a great job with the Oversight Committee on Government Expenditures . She 's the reason wep121ca n't make personal phone calls any more . You know , Bruce  --  " Gold rose when Ralph did  --  " these are really our golden years , that period when men like us are appealing to all classes of women between sixteen and sixty-five . I hope you 're making the most of them . A lot of them go for your kind . " " My kind ? " Whatever currents of euphoria had been coursing through Gold 's veins congealed . " Yes , " said Ralph . " What do you mean by my kind ? " Gold asked Ralph . " The kind of person you are , Bruce . Why ? " " As opposed to what other kinds , Ralph ? " " The kinds of person you are n't , Bruce . Why do you ask ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then decided to take the inky plunge . " Lieberman thinks you 're anti-Semitic . " Ralph was stunned . " Me ? " His voice was hurt and astonished . " Bruce , I would feel just awful if I thought I ever did or said a single thing to give you that impression . " Ralph was sincere and Gold was contrite . " You have n't , Ralph . I 'm sorry I brought it up . " " Thank you , Bruce . " Ralph was placated , and his handsome face fairly shone with grace when he grinned . " Why , I copied your papers at Columbia . You practically put me through graduate school . It 's just that I really do n't feel Lieberman is an especially nice person . " " He is n't . " Gold laughed . " And I 've known him all my life . " The strain gone , Ralph said , " Let me take these notes to Dusty and have her type them up . We 've really covered a lot of ground today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never in his lifetime had he felt more sanguine about his prospects . He glanced out the window at official Washington and caught a glimpse of heaven . Through the doorway , the view of the open office space was a soothing pastoral , with vistas of modular desks dozing tranquilly under indirect fluorescentlighting that never flickered ; there were shoulder-high partitions of translucent glass , other offices across the way as imposingas Ralph 's , and the dreamlike stirrings of contented people at work who were in every respect impeccable . The women allp122were sunny and chic  --  not a single one was overweight  --  the men wore jackets and ties , and every trouser leg was properly creased . If there was a worm at the core in this Garden of Eden , it escaped the cynical inspection of Gold , who could find detritus and incipientdecay everywhere . Gold could look through a grapefruit and tell if it was pink . " You 'll like it here , wo n't you ? " said Ralph , reading his mind . " Is it always like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It 's always like this when it 's this way . " Gold succeeded in speaking without sarcasm . " How is it when it is n't ? " " Is n't what , Bruce ? " " This way . " " Different . " " In what way , Ralph ? " " In different ways , Bruce , unless they 're the same , in which case it 's this way . " " Ralph , " Gold had to ask , " do n't people here laugh or smile when you talk that way ? " " What way , Bruce ? " " You seem to qualify or contradict all your statements . " " Do I ? " Ralph considered the matter intently . " Maybe I do seem a bit oxymoronic at times . I think everyone here talks that way . Maybe we 're all oxymoronic . One time , though , at a highlevelmeeting , I did say something everyone thought was funny . Let 's build some death camps , ' I said . And everyone laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being serious . " " I think it 's time for me to go , " said Gold . " I 'm afraid it is . I 'd give just about anything to lunch with you , Bruce , but I ca n't pass up the chance to eat alone . It 's a pity you ca n't stay through the weekend , although I ca n't see how that would make any difference . Alma would love to have you out to see her terrarium , but Ellie would be upset . " " Alma ? " " My wife . " " What happened to Kelly ? "  | " I think you mean Ellie . " " Yes ? " She got a year older , Bruce . And there was that thin scar from her Caesarean . Ellie would prefer that Alma and I do n't start entertainingas a married couple until people first find out I 've been divorced . " To the blond woman outside his office Ralph said , " Dusty , please tell Rusty and Misty I 'll be showing Dr. Gold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Tell her I 'm horny . " " Sure , love . Bye , sweetheart . " " Who 's Christy ? " Gold asked . " The nice-looking one . I do n't think you 've seen her . " " And what 's all this Dr. Gold shit ? " Ralph lowered his voice . " It makes a better impression . Everyoneknows professors do n't make much money and doctors do . O00000ps  --  there goes one . Did you see that beautiful ass ? Bruce , give my love to Andrea . You might find her a trifle prudish , but she 's really as good as gold . It was n't easy being the only child of Pugh Biddle Conover with all those riches and horses . They ride them , you know . " Ralph pronounced this last detail as though describing a tasteless and unhealthy practice . " And give my love to Belle too . How are the children ? " " Fine . One is still at home . " " That 's too bad , " said Ralph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from an unofficial opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court . It was seven to one , with the other member abstaining because he was under heavy anesthesia . When you get your divorce , do n't fight for custody of the children , or even visitation rights . Make them all ask to come to you . Otherwise they 'll think they 're doing you a favor by letting you spend time with them , which you will quickly discover they are not . " Nearing the elevators , Gold could contain his curiosity no longer . " Ralph , " he said , his fingers clenching nervously , " what do you do here ? " " Work , Bruce . Why ? " " I need some assurance , Ralph , do n't I ? Before I start making changes , do n't you think I ought to find out a few things ? "  | " I do n't see why not . " " What kind of job do you have ? " " A good one , Bruce . " " What do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , what 's your position exactly ? " " I 'm in the inner circle , Bruce . " " Does that mean you ca n't talk about it ? " " Oh , no . I can tell you everything . What would you like to know ? " " Well , who do you work for ? " " My superiors . " " Do you have any authority ? " " Oh , yes . A great deal . " " Over who ? " " My subordinates . I can do whatever I want once I get permissionfrom my superiors . I 'm my own boss . After all , I 'm not really my own boss . " " Well , " said Gold , " what are my chances ? " " As good as they ought to be . " " No better ? " Gold inquired facetiously . " Not at this time . " " When should I get in touch with you ? " " When I call you , " said Ralph . " Pugh Biddle Conover can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator car as the doors were closing . Gold 's mind was shimmering with fantasies of approaching eminenceas the car descended . Secretary of State ? Head of the CIA ? A voice inside cautioned , Zei nisht naarish . Where does someone like you come off being Secretary of State ? What 's so crazy ? he answered it brashly . It 's happened to bigger schmucks than me . By the time he was outside , only one disquieting thought survived . He 'd been fawning.  |p125SEVEN  years back , when Gold had his fellowship at the SenatorRussell B. Long Foundation and she was a research assistant doing advanced work in home economics , Andrea Conover had been too old for him . Now , nearing thirty-five , she was just right . Gold was no longer attracted to very young girls . With everybody doing everything to each other now , Gold had only his middle age and his large reputation as a minor intellectual to recommend him as a lover . It was all he wanted . He had never really liked going down . Andrea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter . She paid for the drinks and dinner with a credit card , shyly confiding she would charge the expense to the Oversight Committeeon Government Expenditures . Gold wondered what in the world she saw in him . She was easily the most beautiful woman he had ever been with , the richest , his first society girl . Her hair was blond . She had blue eyes , a small , straight nose , a broad forehead . Her complexion was light , her skin unmarred . To Gold , who was still shepherding the last of three children through orthodontia , her splendid teeth were of transcending symbolic importance . Her postureand muscle tone were good . " You must learn to think more of yourself , " he told her at one point during dinner , and took her hand lightly for a few seconds . " After all , if you are not for yourself , who else shall be for you ? " A self-conscious prudence deterred him from attributing the paraphraseto Rabbi Hillel.  |p126Andrea  was timid and deferential , and he was not certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the taxi outside her condominium he asked if he might come up for a drink . She consentedwith evident relief , grateful , it seemed , for his preemptive move . The apartment was large for a single person , even for one so tall , and the unexpected good order suggested the daily ministrationsof an efficient cleaning woman . The furniture was ghastly , the pieces outsized . " It was left this way when I bought it , " he was pleased to hear her explain . Gold took it as propitious that she seated herself on the sofa near him after bringing him his cognac . " All that year together at the Senator Russell B. Long Foundation , " she said with some bashfulness , sipping her vodka , " I thought you did n't like me . " " Really ? " said Gold . " I always liked you . I thought you did n't like me . " " I always liked you . " " You should have said something . " " I thought you hated me . I never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " " Really , Dr. Gold  --  " " Call me Bruce , " he interrupted . She blushed . " I 'm not sure I can . " " Try . " " Bruce . " " You see ? " he laughed . " You 're so much fun . " " Why did you think I hated you ? " " Because you knew I liked you , " she answered . " I did n't know you liked me , " he said . " I thought you hated me . She was moderately overwrought , as though charged with somethingheinous . " Why would I hate you ? " " I do n't know , " said Gold , and noticed his hands moving about restlessly . " I had so little to offer a single girl like you who was so sensitive and intelligent and even had her own Ph.l ) . "  | " I would n't have cared , " she said in soulful apology . " I was so impressed with you . Everyone was . You were always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gold was astounded . " Of course . All the girls there thought so . " " Do you still , " asked Gold , " think I 'm sexy ? " " Oh , yes . " She blushed again . Gold wondered what to do next . He laughed loudly and punched her lightly on the arm , as one good fellow to another , and then brushed the back of his fingers against her cheek as though in unpremeditated extension of his jocular disbelief . Her reaction surprisedhim . Instead of stiffening or withdrawing , as he more or less expected her to do , she leaned into his hand and continued bringing herself toward him on the sofa . In a moment they were kissing . Brandy splashed on his knees as he blindly divested himself of his glass and took her in his arms . Her fingers were clasping the back of his head . Again , he was at a loss to proceed with a girl like her . He moved his lips about her ears and neck as though in thirsting search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from experience . Erogenous zones were either everywhere or nowhere , and he meant to write about that someday , too , when neither Belle nor his daughter would be scandalized by his knowledge . With a guilty start he realized his mind had been wandering , and refocused his attention upon Andrea . He clutched her all the harder to compensatefor moments lost in digression and feigned a gasping shortnessof breath . Moaning softly , he kissed her eyes and waited for something to happen . Andrea dropped her hand into his lap and took hold of his penis . Then he knew he had it made . GOLD WOKE up in love and a believer in miracles . Andrea did not seem to mind his scrawny chest and sinewy , hairy legs and arms . He showered and , after breakfasting with just a yellow towel knottedfaddishly about his waist , began to dress lazily . Gold had made the coffee , while Andrea sliced overripe bananas into breakfast cereal . At his suggestion , she added raisins . On his next trip , he would bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee beans , and a French drip coffeepot of ceramic . Goldp128could cook when he had to . He would introduce her to Irish oatmeal . " Will you want to see me again ? " she asked from her dressing table . " Of course , " said Gold . " Lots of men do n't . " " Lots of men ? " Gold , sitting on the edge of her bed , paused with a sock halfway up his ankle . She nodded , turning faintly pink . " I do n't mean lots in here . But lots of men take me out and say they 'll call me and then they never do . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . Do you really want to see me again ? I 'll understandif you do n't . " " I 'd like to come back next week . " " You could stay here with me in the apartment , " she said . " I wo n't be in the way . " " I was hoping you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm so glad you liked me , " she told him . " Was I all right ? " " Andrea , you must never ask that , " he instructed . As a matter of fact , she had not been all right , but Gold was far too astute to delve into that can of worms now . " And I think I 'm in love withyouGold was struck afresh by the number of stunning tall women who fell in love with shorter men like himself who were rapacious , egotistical , and calculating . Andrea might not be expected to know he was rapacious and calculating . Surely , though , she must suspect he was shorter . The explanations that came most readily to the fore were anything but complimentary to either of them . Was it possible that someone so self-assessing as himself had qualities of attraction he was not aware of ? It was possible , for Andrea in the nude was as gorgeous as he 'd imagined , and she seemed to adore him . In morning light her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips small , her grip strong , and all her fair flesh was imbued with a golden tinge that contrasted beautifully , he thought ,  |p129with  his own swarthier pigmentation . She loved his darker color . She was charmed by the hair on his chest . He watched with the possessive air of someone special as she slipped a tasteful print dress over her head and shook out her hair . That she was rich added an extra dimension of vitality and eroticism to the quixotic passion he felt for her . Nothing equals the foot for ugliness , Gold remembered Ernest Becker had written in The Denial of Death , but hers , both bare and shod , were as unremarkable to him as his own . " When I was young , " she ruminated aloud , adjusting a thin gold necklace , " I wanted to be a model . I guess I still do . Not a fashion model . A sex model . " She applied makeup sparingly to her lips and eyes . " I wanted to be a cheesecake model or pose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines began coming out , I wanted to be a pornographic model or act in dirty movies . I used to sit in front of a mirror for hours and practice sucking dicks . For the camera , I mean . Like those models in cosmeticads . I got to be quite good at it , I think . Would you like to see ? " " I have to go back to New York , " he replied in the steadiest voice . " It 's just a small motion of the mouth . " " I have a one o'clock class . " " It only takes a second , silly , " said Andrea , and made a small motion of her mouth above her cylinder of pale lipstick . " Is n't that good ? " " Yes , " said Gold . " That 's quite good . " " I was such a ninny as a child , the only child of Pugh Biddle Conover , " Andrea went on . " I did n't know anything until I left home . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , and then to three colleges . At Smith the other girls would talk about sex all the time , and I did n't understand . I remember I never could figure out why anybody would want to suck a rooster . " Gold was immobilized . In less than two days in Washington he was learning to handle with numb amazement the many bizarre surprises to which he perceived he was going to be **25;5911;TOOLONG . " I can see , " he said , " how that might be confusing to someone who did not understand . " He straightened his other sock and put on his shoes . " Once I found out , of course , " said Andrea , " I took to it all like a duck to water . Last summer I was at the swimming pool at Daddy 's estate with this new beau , and he did the strangest thing . I was scraping a callus off the bottom of my foot with a callus scraper . He stood up suddenly and said he never wanted to see me again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying goodbye to Daddy . Do you know why ? " Gold came up behind her and stroked her shoulders . " Were you near each other when you were scraping off the callus ? " " We were together at the pool . " " Does it make a noise ? " " Like sandpaper . " " I might have done the same thing . " " I do n't know things like that . " " I will teach you . " Andrea pressed his hand to her lips rapturously . Gold wondered if she was crazy . " Sometime soon , " she said , " if you still want to see me again  --  " " I will want to see you again . " " Would you like to come out for a weekend to visit Daddy before he dies ? It 's really a lovely estate . " " What is your father ill with ? " " He wo n't say . Six years ago he bought an electric wheelchair , and he 's been confined to it ever since . Every weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shoot ? " " Quail and pheasant . Sometimes rabbit and deer . " " No people ? " " Not yet . I think you 'll enjoy meeting my father . " " I shall spare you , " said Gold , " from ever meeting mine . "  |p131NO  one in our family , " observed Gold 's father that evening from the most comfortable chair in Gold 's living room , " has ever had a divorce . " " Why not ? " asked Dina . " I do n't allow them , that 's why , " the old man said . " Golds do n't get divorces . We have death sometimes , but no divorces . " " Are you and Mommy ever going to get a divorce ? " Dina inquiredof Gold . " Over my dead body , " answered Gold 's father . " We 'd rather have death , " Gold added dryly , staring through bloodshot eyes from one speaker to the next . In a day that had opened in glory for Gold and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finding company for dinner . Rose and Max had traveled into the city because of a growth in her breast that had proved upon examination , thank God , to be an easily aspirated cyst . Belle , who accompanied them to the cancer specialist recommended by Murshie Weinrock , had invited them back to the apartment . Iry drove in later with the others . Gold 's nerves were ragged . He had work he wanted to continue . " When you starting in Washington ? " his father asked . " I have to go hack next week . To find out . "  --  I'hat 's what I thought , " jeered Julius Gold in satisfaction . " What kind of a job would they give to a Jew like you ? " " Admiral . "  | " Then me they would make a commodore , " the old man shot back , " with all the sailing you done . " " How much you done ? " " I came by boat from Antwerp all the way from Russia with Sid and Rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore , " Gold sighed with a strained smile . " We 're all tired . Can you be a little quiet tonight ? " " He 'll be quiet a long time , " said Gold 's stepmother . Gold 's father elevated himself half out of his armchair and screwed his face up into almost a point . " What 's that mean ? " he demanded . " Well , in my family in Richmond , " answered Gold 's stepmother , concentrating on her knitting and looking weirder than usual in the large pink gingham bonnet she had worn all through the meal , " whenever a child would tell a parent to be quiet or still , the parent , usually the mother , would reply , I 'll be quiet a long time . ' Meaning , of course , that she would soon be dead and would do no more talking . " A moment of shocked silence passed before his father growled , " Well , I ai n't no mother . And I ai n't doing no dying so soon . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , " said Dina . " Thank you , child . " Gold 's father turned away from his second wife with an expression of profound disgust and told Gold , " You 'll come to the house Sunday for lunch . Sid too . " " Not this weekend . " Gold shook his head . " I 've got papers to correct and an article to finish . " " Another article ? " " Another screw , " said his stepmother , " seems to be coming loose . " Gold wanted to kill her . Iry grinned with the rest . " What 's this one on ? " " Education . " " Are you for or against ? " asked his father . " Against . " " It 's about time you got smart . It ai n't done you so much good.  |p133Then  you 'll come next Sunday . I got questions about going back to Florida . " He glanced about the room irritably and demanded , " Why ai n't Sid here ? " " Maybe he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe you did n't ask us to . " " I have to ask ? " " I asked , " said Belle . " They had someplace else to go . " The old man absorbed this information desolately . Rose was yawning and Max murmured that it was time to leave . " Not so fast , " objected the old man . " I got a couple of dead f aygelehs I want to watch on television tonight . " Iry swore he would get him back to his own house in time . Gold shot into his study before the last had gone and began separating his school work from his personal work while bluntly measuring the impact of the divorce he was considering . Belle could take care of herself . His father would be hurt , Sid would n't mind , his sisters would grieve . His stepmother could hang herself . His children could go fuck themselves  --  let their therapists worry about them . The boys were not bad , now that they were both out of the house . Dina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared , he felt , as his twelve-year-old daughter strolled in and said : " Mom 's really pissed , ai n't she ? " " I have n't noticed . " Gold did not look up . " Do n't shit me , " said Dina . " She do n't want you to go to Washington , does she ? " " I 'll let you know when I find out . " " Balls , Dad . Listen , you better be goddamned careful what you put in any more articles you write . That crap on child rearing you had in the Ladies ' Home Journal last year did n't do me no good . " " That was intended as a joke . " " Nobody got it . " " They 'll get this one . " " What 's it called ? " " Education and Truth or Truth in Education . ' " " I do n't get it . "  | " Take a walk . " " How come I got to go to school if you do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " I 'd really like to get out of this house . Living with you and she ai n't no bed of roses , you know . " " Get good marks for a year , " Gold urged . " And I 'll sneak you into boarding school on a scholarship . Let me write your papers for you . " She shook her head . " Not a chance . I ai n't ready for all that teen-age sex yet . I saw what you did to my brothers as soon as they went away . You turned their bedrooms into a study and a library . " " There 's always room when they come home . " " On the floor . You ai n't getting rid of me that fast . I told Lieberman'skid you 're going to work in Washington . " Gold smiled in anticipation . " What 'd you say ? " " I told him the President was giving you a job as a mayor or governor . " Gold flung down a pencil . " Oh , Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking school I send you to ? " " They try , " Dina granted philosophically . " But I 'm too smart for them . Listen , Dad , I 'm warning you . You write anything about me in an article again and it 'll be your ass . " GOLD HAD written the opening paragraph of his article on educationon the plane ride back from Washington and had completed most of the first draft in his classroom that afternoon instead of teaching . He had stacks of student blue books that would eventuallyhave to be read . Dyspeptic and much put upon is how Gold would have described himself to a biographer if ever one should appear . Arriving at the college from the airport by cab late that morning , he was exactly in that physical and mental state . Already his remembrance of having made love to Andrea appeared to belong to an unrecoverable past . He was unshaven and unprepared . He threw nearly all of his mail away . He acknowledged with a surly nod the greetings of colleagues , who were astonished to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to and never went to faculty meetings . He posted a liberal schedule of office hours but did not keep them . Student conferences were by appointmentonly , and he never made any . Gold 's favorites were those who dropped his courses before the term started . He disliked most the ones whose attendance was regular and whose assignments were completed on time . He was no more interested in their schoolwork than in his own . He arrived in the classroom five minuteslate and , to the consternation of all , distributed examination booklets . " Today , " he began right in , " we 're going to have one of those surprise examinations I may have mentioned . Write an essay in answer to a question that would lead you to discuss the high points of the work we 've covered so far . " " What 's the question ? " asked a girl in front . " Make one up . You 'll be judged on the merit of your question as well as the quality of your answer . Begin . " Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber band , was a bundle of blue books from his other undergraduate class , essays , he remembered with a sinking heart , on the psychology of sociologyin contemporary American literature and on the sociology of psychology in English novels of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . They had been written for a course devised by him with no better intent than to lure people into literature from psychology and sociology on the mistaken assumption they would be mastering all three disciplines simultaneously with no greater expenditure of labor or time . Soon , he perceived , he would have this new set of blue books to lug around like a millstone . Lacking anything better to do , he reread the opening paragraph he had written on a yellow pad on the airplane , was tickled by his felicity of thought and word , and took up a pen enthusiastically . His progress was rapid . He was about to move into the concluding section of his piece on education and truth when he was brought to a halt by the first of his students to finish , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterned circles . " Mr. Epstein ? " he called softly as the boy tiptoed past . " Sir ' " " What high school did you go to ? " They spoke in undertones.  | " The Herzliah Yeshiva . " " Oh , yes . I know it well . That 's in Brighton , is n't it ? " " No , sir . Borough Park . " " Have you ever heard of a holiday called Shmini Atzereth ? " " Yes , sir . It comes right after Yom Kippur . " Gold clicked his tongue in disappointment . " How about ShabbosBereishes ? " " Last week . That 's a calendar day , though , Professor Gold , rather than a holiday . " " Do something for me , Mr. Epstein . Give me a list of all the Jewish holidays and calendar days this year . And maybe in some way I 'll be able to repay the favor soon . " " Yes , Professor Gold , I 'll be glad to . I hope you wo n't mind if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gold sighed sympathetically . " So am I. What 's your complaint ? " " It 's called ' Monarchy and Monotheism in Literature from the Medieval to the Modern . ' " " Yes ? " " But it seems to be a course in Shakespeare 's history plays , " said Mr. Epstein . " We 'll be moving on to the major tragedies soon , " Gold answeredbreezily . " All but Othello and the Roman plays . In Othello , unfortunately , there is no monarch , and the Romans were not mon-otheistic . " " The course description in the college catalogue is n't accurate , " Epstein complained . " I know , " said Gold . " I wrote it . " " Was that fair ? " " No . But maybe it was intelligent . We feel that anyone interested in literature ought to study Shakespeare and we know that few students will do so unless we call it something else . " But I 'm not interested in literature . I 'm interested in God . I became an English major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses in theology and religious visionary experiences . " " You were misled , " said Gold . IF I were your adviser I would have forewarned you . "  | " You are my adviser , " said the boy , " and you 're never in your office . " Gold averted his eyes . " I 'm always in class , though . If you 'd like , I 'll allow you to drop the course . " " Should I switch to the Department of Religion ? " " No , do n't go there . You 'll be reading Milton and Homer . Try Psychology if you 're interested in God . I believe they 've latched on to religion now . " " Where are the psychology courses ? " " In Anthropology . Soon everything is going to be in Urban Studiesanyway , so you might as well major in that . But do it soon . Otherwise you might find me there in a year or two and have to read Shakespeare 's history plays all over again . " Gold was praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his essay . Gold prayed also for an endowed chair in the Urban Studies Program that would double his salary while halving his course load . Gold had little doubt he would succeed in Washington if once given the chance , for he was a master at diplomacy and palace intrigue . He was the department 's deadliest strategist in the conflict now raging to attract students to subjects in liberal arts from other divisionsof the college and to subjects in English from other departmentsin liberal arts . Gold wrote the most enticing titles and descriptionsfor the college catalogue , and no one was more successful at originating popular new courses . Gold was the architectof an illicit and secret policy of detente that permitted membersof the German Department to give courses in remedial English to Hispanic and Oriental students in exchange for votes on critical issues at faculty council meetings . Italy and Spain were reeling as a result , Classics was deserted , and France had been isolated . Russia was in decline , along with History , Economics , and Philosophy . China was reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese cooking enjoyed flourishing enrollments . In the most successfulmaneuver of all , Comparative Literature had been walled Off from texts in translation , while Gold and his English Departmentwere free to pillage the continent at will for such triumphant creations of his as " Dante , Hell , Fire , and Faulkner " ; " Through Hell and High Water with Hemingway , Hesse , Hume , Hobbes ,  |p138Hinduism  and Others : A Shortcut to India " ; " Blake , Spinoza , and Contemporary American Pornography in Film and Literature " ; " Sex in World and American Literature " ; and " The Role of Women , Blacks , and Drugs in Sex and Religion in World and American Film and Literature . " It was now possible , in fact , thanks to the enterprise of Gold , for a student to graduate as an English major after spending all four years of academic study watching foreign motion pictures in a darkened classroom without being exposed for even one moment to any other light but that of a movie projector . As a result of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few on campus with swelling registrations and a demonstrable need for a larger faculty , a need filled in part by professors of German teaching remedial English to natives of Hong Kong and Puerto Rico . Gold had made peace with the Hun and enjoyed the high regard of his superiors . Gold himself was saturnine and subdued in the misanthropic pleasure he obtained from these accomplishments . His job was secure . He was esteemed by his colleagues and did not like that . He soon would be given tenure and did n't want it . He would rather feel at liberty . Gold possessed an advantage at the college similar to one he enjoyed with his family : if he did not talk , his relatives assumed he was thinking ; if he did not go to faculty meetings , it was taken for granted he was engaged in more important matters . Like a paramecium feeding blindly and incessantly , the English Department , under Gold 's initiative and supervision , had stealthily been subsuming more and more areas of the Urban Studies Programthrough a schedule of courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City . " Gold had no clear idea yet what Urban Studies was about . But he knew he could do that shit as well as anybody else . GOLD , wxo adamantly repelled conversational overtures on planes from everybody but attractive women , had plunged into his New York Times that morning with hawklike predacity as soon as he was seated on the shuttle returning him to New York . He had called Andrea from the airport in Washington and knew he would phone again from LaGuardia to say he missed her still . He quicklyp139found himself at one of the important sections of the newspaper that interested him the most , the social page . Life in the city had gone spinning on without him . He read : " It 's to die , " bubbled Jan Chipman jammed on a banquette with her sister Buffy Cafritz , the Carleton Varneys and the Harold Reeds . " I would n't believe that my husband would sit on a floor to watch a fashion show . " Gold could believe it . With fingernails curving like claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ragged clippingbetween the leaves of his memorandum pad as frugally as a European bus conductor making change . He would use it , perhaps in his book on Jews . A fragment of political news on the front page kicked over in his memory , and he turned back to read : In Indianapolis this morning , the Presidentdefended himself against a charge that he was a weak President who allowed himself to be " pushed around . " " People who live in glass houses should n't throw stones , " he retorted at a news conference . Gold tore it out . Undoubtedly his President needed him . Businessconditions were the same , he saw in the financial section , theverities of the free marketplace eternally unchanged , although he had to read the key sentence a second time to be sure : Now , however , some analysts believe that the Federal Reserve Bank has stiffenedits credit posture because of the growing danger of an economic recovery . In education , the paper recorded a 55 percent increase in crimes in schools :  |p140The  number of reported acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on teachers , has risen sharply this fall . This improvement followed a sharp upward trend in crime during the school year ended last June . Gold was filled with inspiration suddenly for a brilliant opening to his " Education and Truth or Truth in Education . " He wrote : Education is the third greatest cause of human misery in the world . The first , of course , is life . Here he had to pause . He had no idea of the second . Death was tempting . Death after life was either very good or very bad . It was glib , and might be mistaken for wit . He decided to chance it . He was on his way with another telling piece that might bring him to the attention of an admiring multitude larger than he had yet enjoyed . He closed his eyes and smiled . Gold was never invited to fashion shows . Soon he would be . He wondered if Mr. Chipman had enjoyed sitting on the floor the evening earlier and if he was eager to do so again . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone unreported and was probably lost for all time . Gold was good at daydreaming and gave himself up to the contemplation of what it would be like to work with Ralph for the President , marry Andrea , share her apartment in Washington , fuck her richer and even more attractive friends , serve on a Presidential Commission on education , and be an overpaid professor of Urban Studies . It was to die.  | " BRILLIANT ! " was a word Andrea Biddle Conover employedto praise Gold 's " Education and Truth or Truth in Education . " " Trenchant " was another , along with " pithy , " and Gold rated her animated approval brilliant , trenchant , and pithy . It was not Gold 's method to show new work to anyone but editors . Never , however , had he been so intimately involved with a woman of such stunning ways whose academic credentials surpassed even his own , an undergraduate degree at Smith , a master 's at Yale , her doctorate from Harvard , and a lectureship in England for one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold discovered during his second tryst in Washington that AndreaBiddle Conover 's white terry-cloth bathrobe was too voluminousfor him . The large sleeves could be cuffed back over his spidery hands and forearms , but the abundant folds of the skirt were treacherously long and twirled and dragged behind him in a disorderly train . He saw also with disquietude that his present circumstances would not afford him the money and the time to return to Washington as frequently as he would like . " If you never want to see me again , " she volunteered , " I 'll understand . " That insistent pledge was beginning to jangle . " I do want to see you again , " he assured her with passion . " I would like to spend whole weekends with you . It 's just that I 'm in this awful limbo right now . Ralph does n't want me to call him at the office , and he does n't want me to call him at home . He tells me you wo n't let anyone get personal calls on government telephones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , silly , " she sighed . " He might be annoyed , " Gold reflected disconsolately . " Or I can listen in for you . " " You can listen in ? " " Of course , silly , " Andrea laughed , beaming at his disbelief . " On everybody . " This was the third time , Gold noted , that she had carelessly addressed him as silly . Here was another trait of personality he would soon rigidly have to modify and he found himself looking ahead , with some feelings of vengefulness , to assumingmore broadly the role of mentor and disciplinarian . " You know , Dr. Gold  --  " " Bruce , " he corrected . " Bruce  --  " Andrea glowed each time at such testimonies of minuteobservance  --  " maybe my father can help . But he 'd want to make sure we 're close . A lot of times he helps men and then they never want to see me again . " " How much closer can we be ? " Gold cried , and stumbled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her living room to embrace her . Gold was enamored . Andrea was captivating in all moods and states of dress and at all times of day . While Gold made improvementsin his essay , Andrea , enchanting in eyeglasses , read and graded his student blue books , penciling comments faintly that he could later copy in ink . He pictured an endless and untroubled idyl . Andrea was fascinated by his Irish oatmeal and had responded with gratifying exclamations of rapture to his freshly ground blend of mocha , java , and French roast coffee beans . An entirety of bliss lay in store . She would grade all his papers , balancehis checkbook , and write out his alimony payments . In spring he would make her matzoh brei . WITH MAGNIFICENT self-restraint he kept the article down to four thousand words and mailed this abbreviated , droll presentation of his ideas to an editor of the Times Magazine who had been solicitinga piece from him for almost a year and who rejected it overnight with the gratuitous recommendation he reduce it to eight hundred words , improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep145newspaper , the Op Ed page . Gold knew then he would hate that man till his last breath . He reduced the piece to twelve hundred words and , as directed , submitted this shortened version to the Op Ed page , where it was received with a cry of delight by an irrepressibleyoung editor who pronounced himself blessed to receive so pregnant a work from so revered a source and then requested Gold to cut four hundred words and change the title . " An affirmative statement would be superior to all that enigmaticcoyness , which is not worthy of you , Professor Gold , not worthy of you at all . Use your last sentence as the title instead . " Gold condensed the piece further by four hundred words but stuck to his title and received a check from The New York Times for one hundred and twenty-five dollars . Less than a week after his few paragraphs appeared , two letters stimulated by his piece were published . The first was a note of genial accolade from a nonagenerianin Massachusetts who said he had not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or given a thought to anything but his income and his health since graduating from Williams seventyeightyears earlier and had not in that time suffered a second 's regret or sense of loss . The second was a vituperative attack from Lieberman , who declared Gold " morally nihilistic and **27;5938;TOOLONG , " denounced him for " insultingly promulgating challengingly contrary predications that all we loyal , good Americansmust unprecedentedly disapprove of , " and scornfully defied him to rebut these charges " if he dared ! " Gold loved seeing his name in the papers this second time and was rejoicing as well in the two phone calls he 'd already received . The first was from a leader in the State Senate , who requested Gold 's support of an education bill denying financial aid to any community in New York containing poor people . " The beauty of the bill  --  and I 'm sure you 'll agree , Dr. Gold  --  is that it will help force most families on welfare out of New York State . " Gold held back . " I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change the welfare laws to give money to all poor people who live out of the state instead of those who live in ' ? " By God , Gold ! " Gold , in his time , had produced many a favor/able response . He had never been witness to a better . " I think that 's the best political idea I ever heard . Will you come to Albany and help push it through ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " Then I 'll take all the credit myself ! " The second call was from Ralph . " I thought of phoning you immediately , but the idea never entered my mind . We 're going to send you up to Congress to argue our position for us . You 've given us just the ammunition we need to end all federal aid to public education . " Gold felt terrible . " Ralph , that was n't exactly my plan , " he interposed timidly . " I was trying to improve education , not destroyit . " " Well , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructively . " If we can keep our educational systems just as bad while lowering the cost , we would be improving our educationalsystems a good deal , would n't we ? Bruce , you wo n't have to say anything you do n't believe when you talk to Congress . Just tell the truth . " " The truth ? " " Even if you have to lie . " " I suppose , " Gold reflected , " I could do that . " " The President will be tickled . He was particularly impressed with your statement  --  oh , what genius you have  --  that an ignorant citizen is the best citizen . " Gold gave a start . " That was meant to be ironic , Ralph . " " I 'm afraid we all missed that , Bruce . " " Lately , " Gold complained , " all my sarcasms are being receivedas truths . " " That may be , " consoled Ralph respectfully , " because like all brilliant artists , you are in closer touch with reality than you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare is now assured . We 'll issue the announcementnext week , right after we have your piece read into the Congressional Record with a few changes we have in mind . Only if you approve , of course . I 'd like to cut about two hundred words and take your closing sentence and use that as the title . Then I 'd like to have the authorship read I ) r . Bruce Gold . "  |p147Gold  objected with sadness . " I 'm not a doctor , Ralph , " he pointed out . " You 're a Ph.D . " " So are you , Ralph . How would you like it if people started calling you doctor ? " " I 'd hate it , Bruce . But I 'm not German . " " Neither am 1 , Ralph , " said Gold . " My parents were Russian . " " What 's the difference ? " " Between Russian and German , Ralph ? " asked Gold . " Oh , you know what I mean , Bruce , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph . In what way are Russian and German the same ? " " They 're both European , Bruce . I thought you knew that . " " I did , " said Gold , still depressed . " Not even Anton Chekhov is called doctor . " " It 's only for the Congressional Record , Bruce , " Ralph cajoled . " Nobody reads that but the typesetter , and he 's usually blind . " " Ralph , I would look ridiculous and pompous . Kissinger was called doctor , and you know what people thought of him . No , Ralph , I ca n't allow it . " " I 'm afraid I have to insist . " " It 's my nature to resist insistence . " " Then let me persuade . " " In that case I consent . " " Bruce , I ca n't tell you how inspired we are that you 're coming to join us . You 're already setting a standard of accomplishment that all of us are trying to equal . We call it the Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , therefore , came from Gold . " Ralph , how much will it pay ? " Gold finally found bravery to ask . " I may have to take a leave from college . " " Nothing , I 'm afraid . " " Nothing ? " " Just expenses . Up to a thousand dollars a day . " Gold came closer then than ever in his life to yodeling . " That seems like a lot , " he remarked with staid objectivity . It does n't go as far as it used to . " Ralph sounded sympathetic and ashamed . lie muffled his voice a hit when he continued , " Ofp148course , you can submit a false diary of expenses and perhaps keep a little . If anybody is listening in , I am making that suggestion onlyas a joke . But do n't tell Andrea . She 's scrupulous as a hawk when it comes to government money . Right , Andrea ? Some of thesePresidential Commissions go on forever . " A thousand a day forever appeared to Gold a return that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congressional Record by a Representativefrom Louisiana Gold had never heard of . The morning following , Gold was astounded upon opening his Times to find his article published there again under a different title , accompanied by an explanation below : CORRECTIONLast week the Times published an essay mistakenly called " Education and Truth or Truth in Education " and erroneously naming the author as Bruce Gold . The author should have been identified as Dr. Bruce Gold , who has recently been appointed to the new Presidential Commissionon Education and Political Welfare . Because of the widespread interest in Dr. Gold and his views , the Times is pleased to make this clarification and republishhis essay under its correct title , " Say Yea to Life ! " Another check arrived from The New York Times for one hundred and twenty-five dollars . Gold loved getting money in the mail more than anything else in the world , he guessed , and seldom was unhappy on days some came . He wondered with cheerfulwhimsy whether there might be another letter in the paper from Lieberman.  |p149LIEBERMAN  had put on weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had lost more strands of his carrotcoloredhair . " Did you read my piece in the Times ? " he asked . " What piece ? " asked Gold . " My letter demolishing your article , " Lieberman replied . The tables in the delicatessen were small and close . " I notice you did n't try to rebut me . I had a devastating reply all ready for you and the whole cowardly Eastern liberal establishment . " " Publish it in your magazine , " said Pomoroy . " Nobody reads my magazine , " said Lieberman with abruptly deflating morale . " Put it in your next autobiography , " said Gold . " I 'll probably be a famous government figure by then . " There was something akin to hatred in Lieberman 's glare . " How many people are there on this Commission ? " " Eight , " said Gold . In truth there were twenty-five . " I want you to know , " said Lieberman with the starchy courtesyof protocol , chewing his cheeseburger messily , " that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write devastating articles and editorials in my magazine . " " Nobody reads your magazine , " reminded Gold . " I have friends in Washington . " " No , you have n't , " said Pomoroy . " There are people there who know who I am . " " It 's why you have no friends , " said Gold , savoring as always Lieberman 's tormented display of jealousy and resentment.  |p150Now  it was Lieberman 's round to lie . " Frankly , I would n't even take a job like that , " he said with a gloating snort , and spit chewed bits of ground meat and melted Cheddar cheese onto the sleeves and lapels of his woolen jacket . He rubbed them into the fabric with his thumb . Then he licked his thumb . " Not unless I could be chairman of the Commission , write the report , and have direct access to the President whenever I felt the situation warranted it . You have my permission to tell that to Ralph . " " Ralph will be inconsolable , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . " " There will be dancing in the streets . " Pomoroy , saturnine and somber as ever , sipped unflavored yogurtfrom his spoon aseptically as though from a medicine dropper , glowering at Lieberman like a man nurturing a concealed grudge . " Where 's my book ? " Pomoroy demanded of Gold , touching at last on the purpose of their meeting . " I 've started a new one , " intruded Lieberman . " It 's almost done . " Gold paid no attention to Lieberman either . " By which you mean , I take it , " said Pomoroy , " that you have n't started . " " There 's not much point in beginning until I 've finished , is there ? That will only create a need for revisions later . I like to know what conclusions we 've got before I set out proving them . " " Do you know ? " " Just about , " said Gold . " I know there 've been a number of good books on this same subject of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going to tell you that . " " I may need more money . I 've put aside my novel , you know . " " You 'll have to show me some work . " " I ' 11 show you copies of the books I 'm going to steal from . " " Do n't you believe in original research any more ? " Pomoroy 's tone was only faintly caustic . " Unmistakably , " Gold answered . " That 's why I 'm always so willing to use other people 's . " " I wonder often , " Pomoroy deplored with a sigh , " if editors and writers and thinkers of the past ever engaged in sordid conversa/tions like this one . Then I remember what I know about them and realize they did . Seriously , have you any idea when you might have it done ? I do n't take things like this lightly any more . " " No , " Gold replied frankly . " Give me another month or so to sort things out . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can figure out what they should be . " Gold ate his fruit cup and cottage cheese without appetite . Lieberman had ordered a jumbo cheeseburger , a combination lean pastrami-corned **26;5967;TOOLONG liver-and-Swiss **25;5995;TOOLONG onion sandwich , a plate of Frenchfriedpotatoes , and a chocolate malted milk . " I wish I had you guys ' metabolism , " he had muttered earlier . " Then I could be skinny too . " Lieberman still ate with both hands , ingesting and ejaculating food simultaneously while talking without interrupting himself to swallow or breathe . He had eaten his soup with his spoon in both hands . He held his jumbo cheeseburger in both hands . " I can finish my book in a month and it will be better than his , " Lieberman said . " How can you have such a high opinion of yourself , " Pomoroy asked Lieberman , " when all the people who know you have such a low one ? " Lieberman , chewing pensively , turned the question over in his head as though the interrogation were a petition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of one of the biggest little magazines in the country . " With a circulation of sixteen , " said Gold . " Who belittle you , " said Pomoroy . " I know more , " said Lieberman , " and have a better education than over ninety-nine percent of the American people , which means , probably , more than a hundred percent of all the people in the world . " " So do we , " said Pomoroy . " It ai n't enough , " said Gold . " It ai n't ? " Not for you , " said Pomoroy . " I ) o you realize , I.ieherman  --  "  | " Please call me Skip . " " Do you realize , Lieberman , that you are probably the onlyperson I 've met of whom I 've never heard anyone speak well ? " Lieberman weighed that information gravely . " Never ? " " Bruce , you grew up with him . " " Not really , " said Gold . " Our families lived for a while on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You went to elementary school with him , did n't you ? " " Only for a few grades . His family moved to Brighton Beach . " " But you went through high school together . " " He was one year ahead . " " But you know him a long time . Have you ever heard anyone speak well of him ? " " No , " Gold answered truthfully . " Skip was always lacking in charm , talent , wit , intelligence , and social ability . " " You 're both mistaken , " interposed Lieberman . " I was always the best student in my class . " " The second best , you liar , " said Gold . " I was the best . " " I went to Columbia College on a scholarship . " " No , you did n't , " Gold corrected him again . " And neither did I , although we both say we did . And you were never a member of any Communist organization , so stop taking credit for having resignedfrom one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always tremendouslycomplimented now when singled out as a former one , although he was not quite so complacent when detected at anniversaryand testimonial dinners for reactionary groups calling themselvesconservative at which celebrated anti-Semites and neo-Fascistswere speakers or among the other guests more honored than himself . Lieberman , puff-bellied , jowly , large , and doublechinned , was all for sending in the bombers and for standing up to everyone all over the globe . He was not afraid of war with Russia or China . He was afraid of Pomoroy and Gold . " I 'm a vastly improved writer now , " Lieberman pleaded for approbation with an onset of hope . " I 'm taking a much braver stand with vocabulary now in foreign policy and using lots of epigramsand paradoxes . " Producing from somewhere inside hisp153soiled and rumpled clothing a copy of the next issue of his magazine , he swept open the pages until he at last found the one he wanted , his regular feature boldly headlined " An Outspoken EditorSpeaks His Mind , by M. G. Lieberman , Editor . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried with excitement and prepared to read . " No more rhetorical questions , " he exclaimed and began , " What , then , shall we say to those who argue this may lead us into war ? I say , unflinchingly , then let us have war . ' How 's that ? I express nothing but opprobrium and scorn for the failure of nerve of all the members of the cowardly Eastern liberal establishment . That 's a phrase , " he could not hold himself back from footnoting , " I got from Henry Kissinger . " " You got it from me , " indignantly corrected Gold , who had lifted the quotation from an uncomplimentary assessment of the former Secretary of State in The New Republic that , in union with the wild surmise of his father , had prompted Gold 's earliest suspicionsand helped guide him toward the covert and remarkable hypothesisthat Henry Kissinger was not a Jew . " Our will to resist is waning while that of Russia is on the wax , ' " Lieberman pressed on . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to war every time our vital interests are at stake , then I say we must go to war every time our vital interests are not at stake , to make sure that friend and foe alike understand we will . ' After all , " reasoned Lieberman in smiling paraphrase , his tiny eyes running appreciatively over his columns of type , " what 's the point of building nuclear weapons and bombers if we 're never going to use them ? That 's wasteful , and here  --  here 's where I run out of patience for people without fiber enough for the many sacrificeswe must stand ready to make and the casualties we might suffer . What 's wrong ? " Lieberman recoiled in frantic perplexity from the two stony gazes of which he unexpectedly discerned himselfthe repulsive object . " If you do n't stop talking that way , " Pomoroy admonished softly , finishing his last slice of apple , " we wo n't let you hang around with us . " Tears were standing suddenly in Lieberman 's eyes . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feelings were so sorely injured that he ordered cheesecake with strawberry topping for dessert with his coffee . " Whom , " asked Pomoroy , when the waiter had come and gone , " do you mean by we ? " He looked at Lieberman through his large tortoiseshell glasses with eyes that were quietly incensed . Lieberman took a long time making his guess . " The govern-ment . " " The government is a singular noun , " said Pomoroy . " We is a plural pronoun . You 've fallen into this disgusting , jingoistic habit of saying we , us , and our when talking about the country , the government , our forefathers . Your forefather was a chickenpluckerin Russia . " " In Moravia , " Lieberman corrected . " Who is this we that must stand ready to make the sacrifices and suffer casualties ? " " By we , " said Gold , " he means them . That shitblower . " " I can change ! " Lieberman sought to assure them with a flourishof his hands . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how flexible you can be , " Pomoroy accused sardonically , and Lieberman colored . " I saw your name in the papers again at another one of your fucking fascist dinners . My imaginationfails me , " Pomoroy went on with as much wonder as reproof . " What goes through your mind when you sit there listening to those anti-Semitic speakers . What do you think of ? " Lieberman lowered his eyes . " I do my multiplication tables , " he answered shyly . " Do you applaud ? " asked Gold . " No , " answered Lieberman . " I swear , I literally sit on my hands through the whole meal . " " How do you eat ? " inquired Gold . " I was speaking figuratively . " " Then why did you say literally ? " said Pomoroy . " Do n't words mean anything to you ? " said Gold . " I have to go pee . " " There goes a man , " said Gold , " without a single saving grace . He has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pomoroy was not so easily diverted . " So you 're going top155Washington , " he said with a gaze Gold found difficult to meet . " What will that do to the book you owe me ? " " Enrich it immeasurably , " Gold answered none too comfortably . " How often does a Jew from a poor immigrant family find himself in an important position in the federal government ? " " Too often , " said Pomoroy , and began to cry . " My father 's senile . He does n't know who I am any more and says queer things when I visit him in the nursing home . He calls me Doc and Judge and does n't know why I 've come . A blind man beat him up with a cane last week , and he does n't even know it . He 's got diabetes and may have his legs cut off , and he wo n't understand what 's happened . I ca n't leave him there and I ca n't bring him home . I do n't want to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why I even visit . I do n't have any close relatives or friends , and I 've got no one else I can talk to but you . " " I 've got lots of close relatives and I have no one I can talk to either , " said Gold . " My father 's eighty-two now and wo n't go back to Florida . I do n't want him to get sick here . I 've been holding my breath now for fifteen years waiting for something to happen to him . I 'm afraid it will and I 'm afraid it wo n't . He picks on me , and I 'm still afraid of him . He 's picked on me all my life . Everyone in my family babies me . They treat me like a jerk . There 's nothing I can do about it without being mean . Shit , I 'm indebted to all of them , but guilt does n't change anything . My older brother went to work while I went to college and gets more and more jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose control of myself , and that 's what he wants . My big sister Rose had a surprise party for her sixtieth birthday and it nearly broke my heart when I found out she 'd never had a party before . I felt like crying when they sang Happy Birthday , ' but I do n't feel close to her . She 's had the same office job for over forty years and has been scared every day she was going to lose it . Her husband boozes and is starting to get sick . Everything I do they have to be told about . " " Why do you put up with it ? " " I do n't want them to think I 'm stuck up . I 'm glad my mother 's gone now . I would n't want to have to watch her suffer . I do n't love Belle . Family life is a bore . So is writing and teaching . My kidp156sister in California is forty-five and I think I may still be in love with her . I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is boring . I want to marry money . Wipe your eyes . Here comes the Moravian putt . I 'm sorry about your father . " " Whose sad story is this ? " Pomoroy covered his face with a large white handkerchief as though dabbing just his mouth . " Why do n't you write a book about that if you 're really looking for some unique and significant personal elements ? " he said when he had recovered his composure . " Everything came out all right , " Lieberman reported waggishly , retaking his seat with the patrician comportment of one who fancieshimself the cynosure of adulating regard . " You mean an autobiography ? " asked Gold . Through the corner of his eye Gold watched Lieberman turn stiff . " No , not an autobiography , " said Pomoroy . " But instead of a general approach to the Jewish experience in America I 'm suggestinga work from your own vantage point . I like the idea of Luna Park , and Steeplechase , tailor shops , and beach peddlers . Was Steeplechase really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitle . There was n't even a steeplechase there . " " It must have been interesting to grow up in Coney Island . I 'm willing to gamble the same advance on it . I can sell ten to fifteen thousand copies of any book you write . If we get lucky on this , we might sell fifty thousand . " " I 'd need more money , " said Gold , " for a second start . " " You 'll get no money , " said Pomoroy , " because you have n't made a first . Look , Bruce , I 'm willing to pay to give you an opportunity to try for something true and honest with real merit and distinction . " " What 's my incentive ? " bantered Gold . " Go fuck yourself . " For some moments Gold had been vibrantly conscious of a gutturalnoise droning inside Lieberman as though striving to press past his larynx . It tore from him now in a hoarse expulsion of breath . " And what , " seethed Lieberman , snapping of'f his terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " about me ? " His face was gray with virulence and reminded Gold of a dented aluminum pot . Gold could not decide if Pomoroy 's look of surprise was feigned . " What about you ? " " I lived in Coney Island too , you know , " said Lieberman . " You have n't even read the beginning of my newest autobiography yet , and you 're already publishing his . " " Oh , Lieberman , Lieberman , Lieberman , " Pomoroy chanted in dismay . " Yes , I 've read your newest autobiography and it 's no better than your others or those pretentious beginnings of novels you used to send around . Lieberman , Lieberman , a cat has nine lives . You have one . Lieberman , really  --  four autobiographies for this one little life of yours ? " " This one is different , " insisted Lieberman . " I think the story of my life would be of widespread interest . This one is an affectionatememoir . I forgive a lot of people , even both of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiving . There are lots of warm memories of you and Gold when we were at college together . " " I have no warm memories of the period , " Pomoroy told him . " Be sure to include in your warm memories , " said Gold , " how little interested we are in what you have to remember about us . " " Lieberman , what a dull four lives you 've led , " said Pomoroy . " Who in the world cares how you felt about the Spanish Civil War or the Hitler-Stalin pact ? You were eight years old at the time . " " Eleven , " said Lieberman , " at the time I broke with Stalin . And my opinions were no better and no worse than the opinions of some of the best thinkers of the time . " " They were the opinions of the best thinkers of the time , " Pomoroy retorted . " So who needs them now from you ? You still have nothing new to write about . " " And if you did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about it . " " I still ca n't write ? " " No . " " So why do you try ? " " Why do n't you stop ? "  |p158Lieberman  's underlip came out trembling , a facial reflex to adversityhe had brought with him through childhood . " It took courage , " Lieberman declared , sniffling . " It took courageon those boardwalks in Coney Island and Brighton to argue history and political theory with all those old Europeans . " " On which side ? " asked Gold . " On any side that would be to my advantage , " Lieberman answeredproudly . " That 's something I wish you 'd talk to Ralph about , " he entreated , placing his hand on Gold 's arm . " I do n't think they appreciate how loyal I can be . I can switch positions overnight on any issue they want me to . " Gold felt vaguely fastidiousas he withdrew his sleeve from Lieberman with an ascetic frown and brushed away his touch . " How can he talk to Ralph on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wo n't let him go to Washington ? " Lieberman was disconcerted . " Maybe I will . " " You wo n't devastate me ? " " I 'll have to think about it . " Lieberman arrived at a proposal . " lf I let you go to Washington , will you promise to help me there ? " " I do n't see why not , " said Gold . " I 've come to believe , " said Lieberman , " that government might be my true vocation . Frankly , running a leading little intellectualmagazine is n't as good as it might sound . It does n't bring in much money and has no prestige . And by now I 'm getting tired of making up all those rhetorical questions . I would like , " he disclosedwith a smile , " a position with the Administration of very great influence and authority . " " No  --  oo , " said Gold with extravagant amazement , " shit . " " I know I would do very well . " Pomoroy was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separate checks . Lieberman took a hard roll from the breadbasket and explodedit between his hands with a report that made their jittery waiter leap and caused a number of people lunching nearby to start from their chairs in panic . Even as the last of the two sections were stuffed into his mouth , his stubby fingers were active as sightless slugs scavenging the four corners of the table for crumbs that he pasted to his lips like rhinestone spangles . Gravely he rubbed hisp159nose with his wrist and said , " Why do you think I might not do well in Washington ? " " You 've got no brains , " said Pomoroy . " Or ability , " said Gold . " And of course , you 've got no friends . " " But you 're my friend , " Lieberman remembered . " Not really . " Gold drew back from him with aversion . Pomoroy said , " Bruce might be your only contact in Washing-ton . " " If you do n't devastate me . " " If I let you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? " " I could try . " " Will you help me get a secret CIA grant that I can use to publicize my magazine and build circulation ? " " Hitch your wagon to my star . "  |p160SHOULD  I try to keep count of the plots that are thickening , Gold marveled to himself as he drove toward Brooklyn with Belle , I surely must fail , for their sum increases even while I am busy totaling them . Like the President endeavoring to chronicle events of his office that unfold more swiftly than he is able to describe them , or like Tristram Shandy relating the helter-skelter circumstancesof his birth and his life . Nearly four volumes must pass before he even can come from the womb , and he falls farther and farther behind . Gold was indifferent in his appreciation of Tristram Shandy as a literary work but had won high marks when a graduate student for his paper propounding innovative reasons for an enthrallingadmiration he had never been able to feel . At hand in Gold 's future was an inspiring weekend meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old country gentleman , and perhaps even a warm friendship with the President of the United States , who was struck with such wonder by Gold 's words that he now kept a framed enlargement of Gold 's maxim " Nothing Succeeds as Planned " on the wall of his breakfast room beside a quotation from Pliny . If only the world could know . Gold intended to learn from Ralph whether it was Pliny the Elder or Pliny the Younger . Gold had trouble telling one Pliny from the other and , when drunk , mixed both up with Livy . He had rented an automobilefor the afternoon . Belle rode in silence beside him in an uncompromising attitude of indomitable submission that discomforted him tremendously . Her pudgy round face was expressionless and her head was high.  |p161To  oblige him , she had worn some thick sweaters and a heavy coat . They were calling on his father again , but his hopes for soon excavating the stubborn despot from New York and exiling him to Florida were slim . They Would have to rely on wind and respiratoryinfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle was exacerbated by her passive compliance with everything he secretly schemed . He was dependent on her resistance to connive against her at his best and could not defend himself against such aggravating tolerance and resignation . The breakup of their marriage would have to be completely his own doing . He would carry himself away like a dead weight . Why would she never fight or say anything wrong at home or do anything wrong outside ? Why was she always so fucking kind and practical and so good to the children and his family ? He brooded upon this plight like the victim of something atrociously unfair . On her lap with her purse was a double shopping bag holding scoured pans and glistening bowls from Rose 's party that she was returning to Harriet and Esther . " Why do n't you put them in back ? " he had suggested earlier . " I 'd rather hold them here . " Belle judged him the poorest of drivers , he knew , and she reminded him now of a hausfrau ready to abandon the car with all household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision . By the time he came out of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel , almost all necessary conversation between them had been concluded . He made another attempt to be sociable . " Should I take the Belt or go down Ocean Parkway ? " " Whatever you want . " He chose the Belt Parkway . He was in surly humor . Heavy , threatening clouds hung low in the air and the spectacle of their shadows darkening the choppy water flooded his heart with acidulouspromise and contentment . Nothing pleased him more than the prospect of cold rain . " What were those phone calls this morning ? " " Barry called from Choate , " said Belle . " Noah phoned from Yale . "  | " Collect ? Ca n't kids write letters any more ? " " They each want money . " " Send it . " " Do n't you want to know how much ? " " No . " " Or what for ? " " Not yet . " " Barry wants to go to Moscow for Christmas with a group from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him a travel grant if he 'll promise to major in Russian when he grows up . " " Noah wants to take a share in a ski lodge . " " Skiing ? I have to pay for his skiing ? " Gold nearly disapproved . He had never gone skiing . For that matter , he had not gone to Yale . " He says if we do n't let him do it , he 'll come home every week-end . " " We 've got no room . " " We have the study and the library . " " I 've got my work spread out in both . You know how busy I am these days . " " He could stay downtown in your studio . " " I do n't want him in my studio . Send him the money . " " Have we got it to spare ? " " I 'll make it in Washington . If we ai n't got it to spare we could n't send it , could we ? You interrupted me before , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Belle spoke with some surprise . " You asked me if I wanted to know why they wanted the money and I said not yet . Then you told me anyway . " " How is that interrupting you ? " Belle wanted to know . " You were n't talking . " " I was thinking . I was about to say you 're much better than Iam at managing money and handling the children and can makedecisions like that without asking . You broke my train of thought . " " How can I tell when you 're having a train of thought ? " " If in doubt , " he said , " always assume I am. "  |p163Gold  waited in vain for a fractious response , understood there could be no answer at all if she heeded his instructions . If she heeded his instructions he might never hear from her again . Belle revealed no stronger sign of objection than a slight , knowing smile . If all her existence depended on it , he sensed , she would give him no tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could see into each other 's minds with altogether too much clarity . They discussed little , yet knew everything . She assaulted him relentlessly with patience and placid silence . This is who I am , her upright bearing seemed to say to him with defiance now . I was not a beauty when you married me , and I could n't become one if I tried . He could have his divorce any time he wanted it . All he need do was take it by himself . Obedience and acceptance were the cruel weapons with which she persecuted him , total surrender was her strategy of attack , and he was hard put to withstand her . He had Scotch kippers in mind to fly to Andrea the following evening , and maybe slab bacon as well . Or should he withhold the bacon for a subsequent treat ? Andrea would never go for herring , he believed , but smoked mackerel would charm her . Following the smooth parkway as it curved with the shoreline to the east , he soon saw in the distance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the narrow spit of land across Gravesend Bay and recalled , with some pride in his upbringing , how that Parachute Jump , the hit of the World 's Fair in New York in 1939 or ' 40 , was moved to the Steeplechase boardwalk afterward but had never proved adequately perilous for success to an indigenous population trained on the Cyclone and the Thunderboltand on the Mile Sky Chaser in Luna Park . Now it looked forlorn : no one owned it and no one would take it away . Like those haunted , half-completed luxury apartment houses in Manhattan whose builders had run out of money and whose banks would not supply more , gaping with dismal failure and aging already into blackest decrepitude before they ever shone spanking new . A moment later came the skeletal outline of the giant Wonder Wheel , idled for the year by the chilly season , the only Ferris wheel left in Coney Island now that Steeplechase , the Funny Place , was bankruptand gone . I lard times had descended there as in other places.  |p164Where  Luna Park had last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now rose a complex of high , honeycombed brick dwellings that looked drabber than ordinary against the lackluster sky . On the overpass spanning Ocean ParkwayGold turned his head for a speeding glimpse of Abraham LincolnHigh School and bemoaned for the thousandth time the vile chance that had located him in classes there the same time as Belle and gulled him into a mismanaged destiny of three dependent childrenand a wife so steadfast . If a man marries young , he reasoned aristocratically in the self-conscious mode of a Lord Chesterfield or a Benjamin Franklin , as Gold himself had been minded to do , it will likely be to someone near him in age ; and just about the time he learns really to enjoy living with a young girl and soars into his prime , she will be getting old . He would pass that precious homileticintelligence on to both sons , if he remembered . If only Belle were fickle , mercenary , deceitful . Even her health was good . He turned off the parkway past Brighton at the exit leading towardSheepshead Bay and Manhattan Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which he 'd driven was just about the only section of the area with which he was familiar . Almost all of the rest was foreign to him and forbidding . His thoughts went back to a ramshackle street he 'd passed minutes before on which stood the same moldering antique police station to which he 'd been brought as a small child the day Sid had abandoned him and gone off with his friends . What a heartless thing to have done . Gold must have been numb as he waited in the precinct house . If they asked him his address he might not have known it . The nearest telephone to his house then was in a candy store at the trolley stop on the corner of Railroad Avenue . Just a few years later he was earning two-cent tips for summoning girls from their flats for calls from boys phoning for dates . Brooklyn was a big fucking borough.  |p165SHORTLY  afterward , Gold found himself flushed and overheatedon the porch of his father 's house . Instead of the cloudburst he 'd counted on , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons of his coat . Harriet removed her earmuffsand Sid said , " It 's really amazing , is n't it ? About vultures , I mean . " And Gold , hearing this , suffered a further plummeting in spirit of a kind that might have resulted from a corresponding loss in blood pressure . He had no inclination for resistance . As always , Sunday for him was a gray spell of inertia to be endured in torpor unless one worked as a professional football player or , like Andrea , had horses to gallop and foxes to hunt . On Monday he would meet with Ralph and sleep with Andrea . Tuesday morning he would prevail in a convocation of luminaries as splendid in individual magnitude , perhaps , as any convening that day in all the land . Here , in the webwork of his origins , he had to listen to Sid smack his lips over the last of his glass of beer and continue lackadaisically , " It 's really one of the great miracles of nature , is n't it ? The way vultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Buzzards , " growled Gold , without looking up . " What 'd I say ? " " Gizzards . " " How strange , " said Sid in an imitation of surprise . " I meant buzzards , of course  --  how vultures are able to locate dying animals from live or ten miles away  --  even though all of them , from the moment they 're horn , are always totally blind . "  |p166Now  Gold 's head came up with an involuntary flip , and he stared at Sid as though through a mist . " Says who ? " he snarled , without wanting to speak at all . " Are n't they blind ? " asked Sid . " No . " " What makes you think they are n't ? " " I would know if they were , " said Gold . " From where ? " scoffed his father . " From his college ? " " Sid knows more about science than he does , " sulked Harriet . " Sure , " said his father . " Sid invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired . " " I 'd like another beer , " Sid said . Esther rose with upsetting alacrity to serve him , making everyone feel unbearably sorry for her . " How would you know ? " Sid asked Gold . " I 'd have heard , " Gold insisted moodily . " Like I know about termites and moles . Termites and moles are blind . Vultures are n't . " " He is n't talking about termites and moles . " Harriet addressed her annoyance with Gold to the others . " He always has to correct him . " " Moles make hills . " Gold 's stepmother delivered herself of this wisdom while knitting and purling her wool as usual with her long needles that almost never were idle . Today , a pinprick of a scarlet pimple glowed like blood against the very pale skin on the side of her nose . Her freshly washed gray hair was slightly askew , and she looked to Gold like that demented figure in the painting of Pickett 's charge at Gettysburg . " And some people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest any doubt whom she meant , " take those molehills and make mountains of them . " " Even the Bible says so , " Sid announced as Gold silently gnashed his teeth . " The Bible ? " Gold grew alert as a leopard . He had given universitycourses in the Bible , although he had never succeeded in reading either of the Testaments wholly and had found incomprehensiblemuch that he had read . The value of the celebrated Book of Job remained a mystery to him , the text overblown and the knowledge colloquial , and that of the Song of Solomon hardly less confounding . " Where in the Bible does it say that ? "  | " Three things have no answer for me , " Sid sang out resonantly as a cantor . " The way of a bird with its prey , the way of a corn on its cob , and the way of a man with a maid . Right ? " The cropped interrogation was submitted to the others in a simple-hearted appeal to reason . Gold could believe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horseshit , " he grumbled and then spoke louder . " You 're misquot-ing . " Sid affected innocence . " Nobody 's perfect , kid , " he said with a throb of contrition . " And where does that say anything about vultures being blind ? " " Oh , kid . " Sid set his glass down and began drying his hands one upon the other . You went to college , did n't you ? Use your head . What would be so special about it if vultures could see ? Would that be worth a mention in the Bible ? " " Of course not , " said his father . " Bruce is n't really fighting , " Esther apologized for him with more than the usual flutter in her voice . " He 's only making conversation , " said Belle . My origins were humble , said Gold to himself in a dogged **25;6022;TOOLONG as though he were dictating his , or Henry Kissinger 's , memoirs . My family was impoverished and I had no advantages . Actually , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as I subsequently demonstrated I deserved . Performance was delayed by early hardship . My light was eclipsed by a bushel . Everything I received I earned for myself , except what I got from my father , my mother , and my brother , and from all four of my older sisters . I had nothing going for me but my brains , which I believe I inherited from people other than those persons purporting to be my parents . There is ground for supposing that I am of nobler lineage than first strikes the eye and that I have been lost among these honest , but poor , working folk as the ill-fated victim of sundry circumstantial misunderstandings too tangled for unraveling . My older brother , Sid , with whom I 've been acquainted all my life , is the eldest of seven children , a solid business success with a layman 's interest in nature and mechanics who is liberal with his funds and compassionate and easygoing inp168his dealings with others and is also a fucking nitwit imbecile who treats me like shit and makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark temper now , Harriet had greeted him earlier with an effusion of conspiratorial warmth . Takinghim aside for a confidence , she had said , " Esther thinks Milt might ask her to marry him soon . You have to help . She asked Rose to ask Ida to find out from Sid if there would have to be any sex . Gold curled up inwardly . " Where do I shine in ? " " You can find out things like that , " she informed him in peremptoryexplanation . " You 're an English professor . Sid knows about science . " " Come outside , " his father called to them then with unconcealedill will . " It 's nice now on the porch . " This reassuring news of the weather seemed a death knell to their chances for the day , and Gold felt in the veins of his extremitiesthe wet coldness of slush . " I warned Sid , " Harriet revealed , hardening her expression in hostile preparation for the conflict ahead . " If they do n't leave for Florida by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughters and my grandchildren . " Gold was not altogether easy in league with this cranky , thrifty woman past sixty with whom he had been at odds in one way or another for more than thirty years . In contrast to the fit and virile image he had of himself , Harriet appeared at least a generation beyond her years , closer in age to his father than to him . He noticedhow pinched and weary she looked about her narrow eyes and mouth , how the pores of her face had enlarged , and how her artificially brown hair had thinned . Recalling the libertine escapadesof Sid and his friends in the past , Gold wondered how Sid felt about Harriet now . He knew she had troubles . Her gallbladder had been removed , a younger brother of hers had died of cancer just a few years before , a daughter was back from Pennsylvania on another visit , with her children , and there were inescapable signs of serious discord in the marriage . Sid volunteered nothing . Sid rarely talked of his children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism and disappointment . All his life he had been closemouthed with the family , perhaps in wounded reaction to the continual early strife with their father , who was as raucous in petty displeasure as in volcanic wrath , and as overwhelming in both as in his chronic flights into passionate humming or unrestrained outbursts of singing . His songs extended from simple Yiddish ditties to hearty imitations of American operettaand Gilbert and Sullivan learned from the family radio and to tearful renditions of ballads of fractured love affairs that were the newest contenders for the top of the Lucky Strike Hit Parade . " Ipana for the smile of beauty " became an intolerable , embarrassingutterance he gave in repetitious salute to neighbors and to patrons of his tailor shop or made aloud to himself ; " Sal Hepatica for the smile of health . " " When Nature forgets , remember ExLax , " was another . Julius Gold adjusted his eyeglasses now , the frames colorless in these recent years of suave refinement to blend with the wiry and wavy curls of his thick white hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to the porch open . Sid already was entombed in a posture of relaxation too slumbrous for combat . Harriet began militantly . " So how did you enjoy your stay in New York this year ? " she asked with pointed civility . " I 'll let you know , " he answered , " when it 's over . " Harriet 's offensive buckled right then . Gold 's father was wearing a turtleneck shirt of navy blue and a neutral cashmere sport jacket that Gold appraised as costing easily above two hundred dollars . A corolla of a dotted navy-blue handkerchief blossomed from his breast pocket . The son of a bitch looks better than I do , Gold moped . In ten years he 'll be wearing cowboy suede with fringed yoke and sleeves , and I 'll be drab as Sid . A far cry indeed from the era of the dingy tailor shop in which the old man would go dashing about insanely in vest and flapping shirtsleeves with pins sticking from his mouth , a tape measure flying from his shoulders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faked a shiver . " The paper said something about snow . " Not mine , " said his father . In North Dakota , " said his stepmother.  | " Two people we know , " said his father , " dropped dead from the heat last week in Miami . " Grimly , Harriet prodded Sid . " Was n't there something you wanted to talk about ? " " Crime ? " guessed Sid . " It 's really bad , " said Belle . " Bail does n't work , " said Gold , expatiating . " If you make it low , habitual offenders are right back on the streets . If you make it high they 're punished without having been found guilty . The conceptis archaic when crime is a commonplace and the presumption of innocence no longer rests on safe probability . " His father 's fingers were drumming . " We got just as good now in Florida , " he said as though Gold had not spoken at all . " Prices ? " tried Gold , as a shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , " said Harriet . " We can afford them , " said his father . " We do n't need charity , " said his stepmother . " Just what we get from you and Sid , " said his father impudentlyto Harriet , " and from the rest of my children . Even my daughter in California sends me money . Joannie . " " It 's to die , " said Harriet , giving up again . " In other words , " asked Sid with a grin , " you and Mother here ca n't find anything wrong with New York City ? " " It gets a little cold sometimes , " his father conceded after a pause , " around February or March , but otherwise it 's okay . It 's the Empire State . " Gevalt ! grieved Gold . " You ca n't stay here that long , " he blurted out . " Two years ago you and Mother  --  " " I 'm not your mother , " Gussie reminded him tartly . " Sid ? " said Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cold for you and Mother and much too damp . " " Not here , " said Julius Gold . " What are you talking about ? " Gold 's voice was shrill . " You 're surrounded by water . You 've got the hay in back of you and the whole ocean in front . " " We like , " said his stepmother , " the hriny smell of the sea . " " It 's a dry cold we get here , " said his father.  | " And a very dry damp . " " Why is it , " Gold demanded , " that he can call you Mother and I ca n't ? " " Because I like him , " answered his stepmother with no change of expression . " That 's a good one , " laughed his father . Gussie was aglow with triumph . " Hold this for a minute , " she said and held her knitting needles and band of wool toward Gold . He had to stand to accommodate her , and he clasped them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want your help . As you can see , " she said with her slightly musical cackle , " you 've left me holding the bag , have n't you ? " She wedged her straw tote bag up beneath his elbows . " There . " " What should I do with it ? " asked Gold . " The minute is n't up yet , " she said . " That 's another good one ! " said his father . Momenyu , Gold cursed his fate , and would have flung something heavy at someone , had he not felt hogtied by the responsibility of holding her wool . He spoke to his father threateningly . " I wo n't have much time for you from now on , you know . I'll-be busy in Washington . And I 've got my teaching job to look after and my books to write . " " And Sid and I , " Harriet joined in , " will probably be going away on a long vacation . Maybe even to Florida . " " Stay in my place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a place . That 's why you got us here , to talk about buying a condominium . " " Sure , I told you the condominium , " the old man recalled agreeably . " We 'll talk about it at dinner . " " Dinner ? " Gold 's voice cracked again . " We 're here for lunch . " " I thought for lunch we 'd go to a nice Chinese restaurant nearby for dinner . Sid , you told them on the telephone ? I never ate on no chipped china at home , I do n't have to take any now from that hunch of lousy chinks . Why 's he standing there with that wool like an idiot ' ? " he inquired about Gold . " " I'he minute , I think , is up , " said Gold 's stepmother , and snatched hack her wool and hat ; . " It 's mine , you know .. " I atenvu , thought Gold , and threw himself into a chair . Ile turnedp172to his father and challenged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? " The old man was disturbed by this audacious incursion into a territory of data which heretofore had been monopolistically his own . " You 've got nothing more coming up until . . . " Gold slid from his pocket a typewritten list and found the entry he sought . " Until Hanukkah , " interrupted his father , turned partly around to shield himself from observation . " Which does n't come .. . until the end of December . " Gold rose without noise and looked over his father 's shoulder . His father was consulting a schedule of Jewish holidays similar to his own . With slips of paper in hand , the two confronted each other in joint amusement . " Where 'd you get that ? " demanded Gold . " From Taub in Miami , " said his father . " Where 'd you get yours ? " " From Epstein in Monarchy and Monotheism . ' You going back ? " " We 're practically packed . " Gold sat down . " But not before the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of will , and Gold promptly stood up . " No , sirree . And hurt my children 's feelings ? Not me . " Sid was soonest to recover from this newest disclosure . " What party ? " " Our anniversary party , " the old man announced with exuberance . " You all forgot ? Me and Gussie , we got our tenth anniversarycoming up soon . And we do n't want to make anybody unhappyby going away before the party you 're making . " " When is it ? " challenged Gold . " What day ? " Julius Gold was stricken with an odd look of discomposure and glanced for succor at his wife . Gussie gave an agitated shake of her head and declined to speak . " November fourteenth , " said Belle . " On a Friday . " " Sure , " said Julius Gold . " November fourteenth , on a Friday . And we ai n't going to miss that party for anything , are we ? " " Not , " said Gussie Gold , " for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold to sit mute.  | " Is there much wool in China ? " Harriet rushed in acidly with an air of nasty superiority . " Oh , yes , " said Gussie Gold . " More than anyplace in the world . They import it to clothe the large population . Almost one out of every four people in the world is Chinese , you know , even though many of them might not look it . " Gold 's father grunted at Sid in a touchy undertone . " Emm.is ? " He was discontented when Sid nodded . " This means , " Gold 's stepmother went on informatively , " that of the seven of us here today , almost two of us are Chinese , even though we may not look it . " This time Sid shook his head and Julius Gold dug his teeth into his cigar and puffed it into a blaze . " Who , " asked Belle , " is making the party ? " " I ai n't decided yet , " said the old man , blowing smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 's all alone and has the time . Maybe Muriel because she knows we do n't like her and maybe wo n't be so jealous if I let her . Maybe Ida and Iry because they got money , even though they do n't like to spend it . Maybe Sid and Harriet , because Harriet here always looks so happy when I come to the house to visit , do n't she ? Where 's Ida and Iry and Rose and Max , anyway ? I invited them . Why ai n't they here ? " " I told you , " said Sid . " Iry had a chance to play tennis , " Belle explained to him again . " Max went to see his brother . " " Where 's Esther ? " he asked with crankiness . He suddenly looked sleepy . " What 's she doing in the house so long ? " " She 's setting the table , " Gold 's stepmother answered unselfconsciously . " She asked if she could help set the table for lunch , and I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzlement . " We ai n't eating lunch here . We 're eating in a Chinese restaurant . " " She did n't ask me that , " said Gold 's stepmother , " so I did n't tell her . " At this reply , Gold 's father peered with disfavor at his second wife as though scrutinizing a kink in an otherwise normal chain ofp174events . " Go tell her to stop , " he said with uncommon quietness , and conversed with himself indistinctly until she had gone into the house , when he observed wistfully to his sons , " Your real mother was better than her . She was sick a lot , but she never stopped working . " To so touching an encomium a reply seemed a sacrilege . Sid changed the subject . " Pa , I want to go to Florida this week and find a good place for you to live after your anniversary party . " " I might want to stay longer here . " " You ca n't stay here longer , " Harriet said with more severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . " " Why ca n't I use my own ? " " We 've got the money , " Sid retorted sharply to Harriet . " So please do n't say that again . " Harriet bit her lip . " Now you 're starting fights , " she accused the old man . " I ? " said Julius Gold with a hand to his heart . " I 'm starting fights ? " Indignation was prominent on every feature . " Not me . I do n't start fights . You got the last person in the world . It ai n't my fault your daughter 's marriage is breaking up , is it ? Do n't blame me no one ever told her how to be a good wife . I 'm not the one who told her to marry that noisy nobody in Pennsylvania just because his family has department stores . Did I tell Esther to marry that crazy Mendy ? " he said as Esther reappeared then , lucklessly , and was brought to a standstill , her pitiful smile petrified upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that temper of his . Always blowing up at me , over nothing . It ai n't my fault she 's a widow now and I have to be embarrassed with my friends because my daughter got no husband . So ugly he was with a face like a monkey  --  they had better in Barnum and Bailey . What are you crying about ? " he reproached Esther with surprise . " Go back inside if you want to make noise like a baby . Here , take these dirty glasses while you 're going . One of them 's cracked . You did n't even invite me up to the funeral , she thinks I do n't remember , do n't she , but I know more than she thinks . You thought I 'd never say anything about it , did n't you ? " he gloated . The mask was off ! ( ; old wasp175gaping at him with incredulity . The raw cruelty of the mad tailor of Coney Island had not lessened . The man had merely aged . A monster , Gold breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle and next with a savage glower at Sid , a fucking monster ! " Gussie , get my topcoat , " his father requested with disinterestand fatigue in a steep alteration of temperament that was inconceivablyabnormal in a person not wholly insane . " We 'll soon go eat . And straighten your hair or something . Your head looks crooked . " He struck a note about halfway between a groan and a cry and held it on pitch in a low hum until she had left , when his voice flowed into words without a break from the long , distressful drone . " Am I wrong ? Or does she sometimes talk like she 's crazy ? " No one there would argue he was wrong . " If Jews got divorces , " he philosophized , " I sometimes think I might want one . " " Jews get divorces , " said Belle , the only woman present he had not yet insulted . " Not real Jews . Not Golds . Not this Gold . " For one moment longer the old man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe someone like their spoiled daughter comes home to her parents with her children to get a divorce . Or maybe someone like your college-educated husband here got something like that in mind when he goes off to Washington on a fishy job and leaves his wife behind and maybe do n't even ask her to come . But not me . What 's the matter ? " he asked in surprise with that same phenomenal resilience of personality of someone unregenerately self-centered . " Why 's everybody look so angry ? It 's a party , ai n't it ? ' ' Sid answered cautiously . " You 've been saying some pretty awful things , Pa . " " I ? I say awful things ? " The old man 's hand covered his heart once more as he dismissed the accusation with a fixed smile and a dogmatic shake of his head . " Not me . I 'm not the one who says things . Do I ever say anything about Ida and the way she bosses.:around that puppy dog of a husband or what Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with displeasure and his eyes were hot and glaring . " I ) id I ever once say anything about howp176you used to sneak away to Mexico with those skinny dress models so often even your smart wife here would know , or how my younger son here keeps downtown an apartment for his who-ers he calls a studio and never once invites me to sleep there but makes me ride all the way home at night into Brooklyn ? " " Will you shut up ? " screamed Gold . " I would n't lay my head down on one of your filthy mattresses ! " " Ca n't you please shut up ? " screamed Gold again with an urge to take him in his hands and tear him apart like a turkey . " I ? I should shut up ? What am I saying that 's so terrible ? To a father you say shut up ? Sid was big as a football player when he was young , but I still gave him plenty all his life . Once I even chased you away for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chuckling . " You sure did , " said Sid . " Look how warm it gets when the wind stops . Why 's everybody so quiet ? I do n't like to go eat with a bunch of sourpusses . Gussie , make somebody laugh , " he ordered as she reappeared with his topcoat . Gussie tried . Her shiny skin paling almost to translucence , she approached Gold with her tote bag closed and proffered the tip of a fabric protruding from the opening . " It 's yours . I finished . Take it , my son . " " What is it ? " Instinctively Gold put his hands behind his back . " A sock . " " One sock ? You knit me one sock ? " " I only have two hands . Last May I saw a hole in your sock . If I 'd seen a hole in both socks I would have knitted you two . " " What 'll I do with one sock ? " " Maybe you 'll lose a foot , " said the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , bigshot , take it . " Gold , overmastering caution , took hold of the corner of cloth and pulled  --  and pulled  --  and felt he might have continued pulling until the earth stood still , for out of the straw bag waggled a serpentinesection of that knitted band of wool she had been diligently spinning like a spider for all the years she had been his stepmother . It was not a sock , it was a practical joke , and there was simpering . Gold forced a smile , cursing her horrendously in silence , andp177said , " Oh , Mother , Mother , that is a hot one . You really are funny . " " I 'm not your mother , " was the swift retort . " She got him again , " cheered his father , rising . " It 's your fucking fault , " Gold bristled at Sid as the group milled from the house toward the two automobiles at the curb . " Next year move them into my neighborhood with all those niggers , nuts , and welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want some advice , " he whispered , drawing Sid farther aside . " I need some help and I think you can give it . " " You name it . Anything you want , kid . " " You could begin by not calling me kid . " Sid was moderately abashed . " I did n't know that bothered you . " He rubbed his knuckles across his chin in a movement of meek self-mockery . " I guess I 'll always think of you as my kid brother , no matter how old we get . I promise I 'll never do it again , kid . What else ? " Gold tolerated the unpremeditated lapse with resignation . " I may need this for my book . " He circled Sid as though by inadvertenceto hide his face from the others . " A Jewish guy goes out of town for a while , to Washington , let 's say , and wants to stay with another woman . Is there any way he can protect himself against calls from his wife ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , " he answered with joyous affinity . " Telephone the switchboard every evening to hold all calls . Telephone again the next morning to see if there 've been any . Return all calls from your hotel room . " " I think I 'd be afraid . " " Oh , no , kid , do n't ever be afraid . That 's the worst . You got a nice girl there ? " " It ai n't for me . " " Too bad . The worst thing ever is to be afraid . " Sid 's eyes were glittering in spirited recall , and he ambled casually around Gold to turn his own back to the others . " I used to spend weeks in Acapulcowhen I was supposed to he in Detroit and Minneapolis . Once I spent four nights right here in Manhattan when she thought I was in Seattle . " You got caught once in Acapulco , did n't you ' "  |p178Sid  nodded with a soft bronchial laugh . " Her uncle was in Mexicoat a druggists ' convention . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she ordered me out of the house , I went back to Acapulco . When she moved out with the kids to her mother , I moved into a hotel suite in New York and had parties with Sheiky , and Kopotkin the machinist , and Murshie Weinrock . Mursh was an intern then and brought nurses . When Harriet smashed an ashtray , I broke a dish . She pushed over a chair , I pushed over a whole breakfront full of china . Once she saw I was never going to be afraid , it turned out to be a pretty good marriage , I think . " Sid never had said so much about himself or ever appeared so merry and animated . Gold heard him with fascination . Science , machinery , fearsome dray horses at the Brighton Laundry , now marital infidelities with farcical catastrophies at home  --  the only subjects on which he 'd ever heard his older brother dilate . There had to be more underneath such disciplined reticence . In an access of powerful fresh feelings , Gold proposed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from Washington . I 'll take you to a good uptown restaurant where we can see some writers and theater people . " " I 'd like that , " Sid exclaimed with such shocking modesty that Gold could do nothing but stare . " We 've only done that once , I think , when you got out of college . We 're all very proud of you , kid , you know , " he disclosed , to Gold 's added surprise . " Not everybody 's got a college professor in the family . " You sure as shit do n't show it , " Gold said with a smile . Harriet was honking the horn from her seat in Sid 's Cadillac . " Sid , why 'd you stop running around ? Old age ? Health ? " Sid argued he was only sixty-two . With a blush , he confessed , " I began to be afraid . " In Gold 's car Esther started crying again . " It was n't that we did n't want him at the funeral , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were trying to save him the trouble . " " How come , " Gold asked Belle , " you remember their anniversarydate and they do n't ? " Belle smiled . " I made it up . I picked a Friday so they could pack on Saturday and leave on Sunday . "  |p179Gold  approved . Both women alighted at the Chinese restaurant on Kings Highway and Gold accepted like a godsend the solitude in which he found himself for the quarter hour needed to park and walk back . " NOBODY , " SAID Sid without warning as Gold was lowering himself to his chair , " knows the mouth of the Nile . " He had ordered a family dinner for twelve . " The source , " said Gold and finished sitting down . " What 'd I say ? " " The mouth . " " How droll , " said Sid , his face in flower with trickery and delight . " I 'm not myself today . " " Yes , you are , you rotten fuck . " " He said please pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of mind . " And everybody knows the source of the Nile , " muttered Gold , eyes focused rigidly on the food already there . " Everybody ? " " I do n't know it , " disagreed his father . " I do n't believe I know the source of the Nile , " said his stepmother . " I do n't know it , " said Esther . " Everybody who wants to take the trouble to find out . " " Do you know it ? " teased Sid . " Yes , " said Gold . " Which one ? There are two Niles . " " Two Niles ? " The women spoke as though with one voice . Gold was unwary . " Yes . A Blue and a White . " He looked up with concern at the sinister stillness that fell and perceived from the ineffable solemnity on the faces pondering him that he had blundered into another disastrous pit . Commiseration mingled with anxiety in the gazes of the women , and tears of pity were mounting anew on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid , you treacherous , malicious , infantile motherfucking bastard , he chanted to himself in a litany of misery . You have bushwhacked your baby brother again . " Two Niles ? " his father was already growling irately , spillingp180hot tea onto his lap from his trembling cup . " A Blue and a White one ? What in hell 's the matter with him ? " " Ca n't you tell when he 's joking ? " Belle interceded with not too much faith . " Is anything wrong ? " asked the tall , well-muscled manager with menacing inscrutability , arriving to insure that nothing in his restaurantever would go amiss . A second contender for the world karate championship glided noiselessly up alongside in formidable allegiance . " Not at all , " Sid hailed them both jovially . " We 'd like a couple of more orders of pork . The soup is superb . " Gold , face to face with futility , used the intermission to escape his predicament . " Never mind my Niles , " he put it bluntly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off guard . His jaw dropped and his cheeks quivered . " Yes , " said Sid , joining forces with Gold . " Why ca n't I stay here ? " asked Gold 's father , and added winningly , " I 'm no trouble . " " Pa , I want you to buy that condominium . " For one moment more the old man glanced wildly about in hectic disorientation . Blood rushed alarmingly to his whole face , and he choked with such anger and violent confusion that he seemed to be fighting for each mouthful of air . Words would not come . In torrentsof fury and frustration , he began poking with a bent finger toward the table in imperious spasms , his walleyed gaze rolling from the people seated on one side of him to those on the other . At the first motion of his arm , the ancient reflex abiding in the others leaped into life , and everyone present lunged with terror for the closest dishes of food to pass to him . Gold pushed plates of duck , spareribs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was sitting nearest , gave him the enormous bowl of wonton soup . Gold spied the hairline crack in the porcelain an instant too late to scream and foresaw with an intuition that defied any possible doubt just what would follow . The crash when the bowl shattered on the floor was even more hideous in reality than in his despondent imagination . The manager returned in a moment with a visage of awesomeforce and authority , joined this time by three unsmiling war/riors with onyx eyes and closely shaven heads and a jittery Oriental woman with bright lipstick who carried a very long , thin pencil . " Is anything wrong ? " " Chipped china ? " inquired Esther . " Vehr Gehargit ! " the old man roared in reply to the baleful Chinese manager when he at last found his voice , stabbing his forefinger into the tall man 's stomach and driving him back . The man blanched as Julius Gold , still thrusting toward him , shouted , " I do n't want no condominium ! I live here , not there ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already on his feet , gushing twenty-dollar tips and magniloquentapologies like a fountain . Fuck him , steamed Gold , dispensingones and fives with the readiest of hollow laughs to dumbfounded children and parents at tables nearby . He should be locked up ! In a prison , not a hospital ! In handcuffs ! To the walls of a dungeon he should be chained , that crazy fuck of a bastard , fifteen feet off the ground ! In time the floor was mopped and they progressed through the meal to the pineapple , ice cream , and fortune cookies in near total silence under the harrowing pretense that nothing untoward had intruded . The haggling that did ensue was concise . The old man was not returning to Florida until he was good and ready . Sid guaranteed a visit from at least one branch of the family every month for no less than five days . Nothing doing . Every three weeks for seven days ? We 'll see about that . " Fuck him ! " Gold ranted to Belle in the car going home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start coughing his lungs out . Let him start complaining he 's lonely because we do n't come visit . " " You 'll be in Washington , " Belle said laconically . And fuck you too , Gold fulminated in silence with an evil squint at his wife . You 're goddamned right I 'll be in Washington . At midnight he was on the telephone to California pleading with Joannieto come to New York to try to take charge . She was having trouble with Jerry , and a lawyer had warned her not to desert the domicile . " He broke the soup ! " Gold insisted tragically in recapitulation . " He broke the goddamned soup ! I think this must he the worst
