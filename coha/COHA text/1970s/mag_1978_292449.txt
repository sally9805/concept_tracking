There 's a lot of action by Ted Kennedy , but can he be President ? <P> Polls show President Carter in deep trouble , and that naturally makes the nation 's political leaders consider the alternatives . That means Kennedy . The renewed interest in the Massachusetts Senator was emphasized even further last week by a TIME poll in which voters stated by a dramatic margin that the issue of Chappaquiddick would not prevent them from voting for Kennedy . TIME Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian spent several hours with the Senator last week and wrote this report : <P> The controversy swells again . Ted Kennedy-whether he likes it or not , whether he is encouraging the development or not-is back in the middle of an intensifying stir about whether he will be a candidate for President . <P> He is the most popular Democrat in the country , yet he sometimes seems strangely isolated . One day last week he stood alone in the kitchen of his house in McLean , Va. , turning a couple of steaks in the broiler . His red-checked shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing a thick mat of hair , now graying . The huge house echoed with memories , but now it was empty and still . Kennedy 's wife had been living in Boston , away from the family for more than a year , and his children were at Cape Cod for the summer . <P> " Why should I be talking about running for President ? " he said as he waved the big fork in the air . " There 's a Democrat in the White House , there 's no moral crisis in the country . What 's the reason for running ? For power ? For what ? " If Carter were not down in the polls , Kennedy added , nobody would be asking him questions . " When Carter goes down , " he said wryly , " I go up . " He had another thought about that . " The press made Jimmy Carter , and now they 're trying to destroy him . I 'm going to set my own course . " <P> Inside the dark dining room , a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the table for Kennedy , and now he set another place for his guest . A call came from his son Patrick , 11 . Kennedy bellowed into the phone after he listened to the boy tell about catching a manta ray that day . He lighted some candles , opened a bottle of white wine , and began tasting his cooking . " Yes , I would like to be President , " he said frankly . " Yes , I feel I can do the job . But this is n't the time . "
