txt Failure of Congress to pass an energy program this year puts President Carter in an awkward spot vis- ? - vis both OPEC and America 's European allies . Mr. Carter 's plea to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a price freeze next year ? a plea now backed by Iran , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , and Qatar ? was based partly on the assurance the United States would be doing its part to save oil . Proof of this , in the White House view , would have been a national energy program embracing the President 's conservation formula , centered on stiff taxes to discourage wactPful use of oil and natural gas . Japan and Western European countries , meanwhile ? which have reduced their daily oil consumption since the Arab embargo of 1973-74 ? are waiting for the U.S. finally to do the same . Instead , U.S. oil consumption has grown // From  --  a e 1 Energy bill delay hurts U.S. abroad steadily since 1974 , with imports rising from 6.1 million barrels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 10 months of 4977 . During November , it is true , U.S. consumption of oil ? a bit more than 17.4 million barrels daily ? ran lower than during November of last year , when consumption averaged 18.6 million barrels a day . But this drop , energy officials say , results from a quirk in the weather , not from conservation as a policy . November this year was warmer than the same month last year , when the " coldest winter in 100 years , " said an official , already had begun to send oil consumption soaring . American homes and factories are burning less light and heavy fuel oils this year than last , so that savings show up in the distillate and residual fuel oil categories . Demand for gasoline is running about the same as last year .

Even such-agreement in principle , however , would be a weak reed for the President to lean on , as he starts off Dec. 29 on a trip to six nations , including two key members ? Iran and Suadi Arabia ? of the 13-nation OPEC . By the time Mr. Carter arrives in the Middle East , the world should know how much , if any , OPEC plans to raise oil prices next year . The cartel meets in Caracas , Venezuela , Dec. 20 , with a majority of members pressing for at least a modest price hike . Many analysts believe that OPEC members , rather than split the cartel on the pricing issue , will end up doing one of two things ? freezing prices temporarily with a review in the spring for raising the cost of oil slightly .

This fact , coupled with Mr. Carter 's warning that industrial nations can ill afford another increase , argues for a price freeze . But some OPEC members , particularly those whose large populations swallow up revenue from oil , press their right for enough price increase to offset the 6 to 7 percent inflation rate throughout the world .
