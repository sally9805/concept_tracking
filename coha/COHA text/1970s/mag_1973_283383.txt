Minnesota 's " big north country , " with its gentle hills and thick stands of birch and pine , seems an unlikely spot for the most ambitious urban test yet conceived in the U.S. But last week 50,000 acres of Aitkin County , some 120 miles north of Minneapolis-St . Paul , were officially chosen as the site of the Minnesota Experimental City . If all goes as planned , MXC , as the city is called for the time being , could be completed in 1985 and have a maximum population of 250,000 . <P> The experimental city is planned as a totally new town-with the accent on new . Unlike most of the nation 's other new communities , it will not be an instant suburb of another city . Instead , MXC will nestle in the wilderness as a self-contained entity , serving as a living laboratory for the most advanced ideas in urban planning , environment and technology . Planners expect that 130,000 jobs could be created in MXC , mainly in research-oriented industries like environmental technology and communications . <P> MXC will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area will be roofed over so that residents can enjoy an overcoatless climate all year round . Electricity for the air conditioning might come from a municipal power plant that burns garbage in pollution-free furnaces . As for the people who live outside the city center , they will be able to shop either by cable TV from home , or else drive to automated highways that will whisk their cars to downtown parking lots that are a short , pleasant stroll from the stores . Or if people prefer to ride , there will be moving sidewalks and computer-run , driverless minibuses . <P> Farms will be mixed with factories and homes to provide what Neil Pinney , MXC 's chief architect-planner , calls " a rural-urban balance " throughout the city . Nowhere in MXC will there be skyscrapers ( " Psychologically alienating , " says Pinney , who used to work with Los Angeles City Planner William Pereira ) . In their place will be " megastructures " complete with their own housing units , streets and transit systems . <P> While all this might sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked back as often as forward . Their stress is on old-fashioned values- " good food , good friends and a good relationship with the earth , " Pinney says . That means a return to windmills for some electrical power , to cottage industries for some employment , to a feeling of community through the intimate clustering of neighborhoods . <P> Test Center . This dream city is the brainchild of freewheeling Scientist Athelstan Spilhaus , an oceanographer , physicist and meteorologist . In the eight years since he first got the idea , MXC has drawn support from Twin Cities business leaders , the federal and state governments , and top thinkers like R. Buckminster Fuller , Economist Walter Heller and Urbanologist Harvey Perloff . Their combined efforts are aimed at starting construction by 1975.
