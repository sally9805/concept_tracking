THE GUGGENHEIMS : AN AMERICAN EPIC by John H. Davis Morrow ; 608 pages ; $14.95 <P> Like many patriarchs , Meyer Guggenheim loved to speak to his family in maxims . One was : " Roasted pigeons do not fly into one 's mouth . " Another required a little elaboration . Pulling out a bundle of seven sticks , one representing each son , he asked each to break it . When none could , Meyer pressed his point : " Together you are invincible . Singly , each of you may be easily broken . Stay together , my sons , and the world will be yours . " <P> The lessons were not lost . Together , the Guggenheim sons-Isaac , Daniel , Murry , Solomon , Benjamin , Simon and William-made much of the world theirs . Building on the medium-size fortune left them by Meyer , a Swiss Jew who had immigrated to the U.S. in 1848 , the seven sons stood fast to create the greatest mining empire of their time . With boldness and flair , they laid a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alaska . They built a modern port and a 55-mile-long aqueduct to seize another copper mountain in the Chilean Andes . They raised the family flag over tin in Bolivia , silver and lead in Mexico , diamonds in the Congo . By the outbreak of World War I , they controlled 75% to 80% of all the silver , copper and lead in the world . <P> The Guggenheims , or the " Googs , " as they were condescendingly labeled by New York 's older , more staid Jewish families , exploited people as ruthlessly as they did minerals . Yet they could also be uncommonly generous , and before they exhausted their funds and energies , they set new standards for imaginative philanthropy . A list of their legacies includes the Guggenheim fellowships , Manhattan 's Guggenheim Museum , and foundations that helped finance Robert Goddard 's pioneering rocket research and the Leakey family 's exploration into the origins of man . <P> Author John H. Davis has discovered in the Guggenheims his own rich vein of biography ; his book fails only in the leaden prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylistic obstacles and makes The Guggenheims a consistently fascinating saga . <P> Of all the brothers only Isaac was a bore . Simon bought his way into the Senate , where as a Republican from Colorado he spoke against " cheap Spanish lead and also the Australian lead . " Benjamin , the charming rake , went down on the Titanic , changing into evening clothes for the event . William , another wastrel , named the principal rooms in his house after the metals on which his fortune was based ; the Salon d'Or was reserved for love . Solomon , who kept a suite at Manhattan 's Plaza Hotel , gave the doorman $1,000 tips so that he could keep his Fierce-Arrow parked permanently near the door , and once gave the captain of an ocean liner $10,000 to turn around in the English Channel and go back for his daughter , who had missed the sailing .
