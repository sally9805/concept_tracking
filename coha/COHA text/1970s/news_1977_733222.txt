He is the president of the Illinois Association of Future Homemakers of America and Home Economics Related Occupations . The first male president to be elected in Illinois , the second nationClose-up won Dorothy Collin NOW , FUTURE Homemakers of America is not an organization that is on the tip of most Chicagoans ' tongues .

It 's really a civic group . " BUT WE do n't want to put down homemaking . The image problems stem from a misunderstanding of the word homemaker . A homemaker is anyone who contributes to the running of a household , to the raising of a family . " The running of a home is not just cooking , but Is consumerism and providing the proper clitnate and many other things . It 's not just a woman 's responsibility ; It 's a man 's and the children 's too . " Everyone is a homemaker whether lie realizes it or not , or likes it ur not . " Bob speaks from experience .

" , Though he thinks his generation is more open-minded , he also thinks it is more apathetic . " In the 1960s , at least kids were involved . Even if the causes were n't always popular , they at least got off their tails and did n't let the world wash over them . " Today kids would rather sit at home and let the TV wash over them or they would rather stand on street corners and watch cars go by .

There was not a stampede . But she tried again and eventually got Bob interested in running for state president . " I did some homework , boned up on the organization and what was involved , and it sounded intriguing , " he said . " So I said O.K. , I 'd run and came up with a platform . " And the platform was to improve the group 's image and involve more boys in the 15,000-member state organization . That intrigued the 1,900 delegates to the state conference , 1,350 or so of whom were girls . " Actually I had kind of an unfair ad. vantage , " Bob said .

" So far no one has said any male who would want to be president of Future Homemakers must be gay , " at least never to my face , " Bob said . Though he admits that " a year ago if someone told me a guy was president of it , I might have wondered about him . " HE SAID 1IE thinks his generation is better able to accept role reversals because it grew up with women 's liberation . " People have changed their Ideas , " he said .
