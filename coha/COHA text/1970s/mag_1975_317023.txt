The following is excerpted from a speech delivered by the Editor in Chief of Time Inc. at Deere &; Company in Moline , III . <P> " Crisis " gets fearfully overworked , and journalism may be the chief offender , but sometimes there is no avoiding the word : the U.S. is caught up in a crisis of foreign policy . It is not so much the dangers and difficulties pressing on us from abroad , as a crisis in the making of foreign policy here at home-in the process itself and in the thinking that underlies the policy . <P> The war in Viet Nam and the scandal of Watergate dominated a whole decade of our national life and led to a severe alienation of many Americans , especially the young , from their Government . Two Presidents were destroyed by those two tragedies . Now we have in the White House our first appointed President , a nice man with a weak base in Congress and spotty ratings in the public opinion polls . So we came up to the very harsh events of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has come to rest heavily on popular trust in the Executive , already in disrepair . <P> We have to recognize that the almost unanimous popular and congressional support of a highly activist foreign policy , which lasted from Pearl Harbor in 1941 to about the middle of the 1960s , was something new in American history . The older American pattern was popular apathy about foreign affairs , in which the President often shared , or else a sharply divided public opinion , as in 1939-41 , or 1914-17 . <P> We also have to remember that the tremendous preponderance of American power in the world , from roughly 1945 to the early 1960s , in itself was another abnormality . It could not have lasted , and it did not . We had been a major power from about 1900 on , and then after World War I , the strongest single power . But we came out of World War II a kind of colossus , with more economic and military power than all the rest of the world put together . Even ten years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both fully recovered from war damage and with their production higher than prewar , the American gross national product was 36% of the total G.N.P . of the world , including the Soviet . As late as the Cuban missile crisis in ' 62 , we probably outweighed the Soviet Union at least 10 to 1 in nuclear striking force . All that has changed . Today we are in rough military parity with the Soviet Union ; our G.N.P . in 1974 was 27% of world G.N.P . <P> At the same time , we have in America a far bigger and better-informed foreign policy constituency than ever before . The problems of conducting foreign policy in front of and with the consent of this constituency are something new . Henry Kissinger , in his melancholy vein , recently despaired as to whether you can have a truly consistent foreign policy in a democracy . He is sometimes accused of hankering after the good old days of Prince Metternich-one autocrat who can say yes or no ; one agent who can speak for the autocrat ; no necessity to troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees that may then vote against you . But the formation of foreign policy in a wide-open democracy that happens to be a superpower is an art and a relationship we have to figure out , we the people as well as the government .
