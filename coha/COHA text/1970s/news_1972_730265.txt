txt President Nixon , a barefoot black girl clinging to his arm , toured a flood evacuation center here today and told victims of raging Susquehanna River waters , " We appreciate your spirit . " Flying aboard an Army helicopter , Nixon landed on the football field of Harrisburg 's Penn High School where gymnasiums have been filled with cots to house evacuees . An 8-year-old black girl attached herself to Nixon and made the tour with him , alternately holding his hand and clutching his arm . The President later told two reporters who accompanied him he felt the child had been separated from her parents . " Children often grab the hands of older people . " he said . " In cases like this people want someone to hold onto . " The child would not tell her name to reporters but whispered in Nixon 's ear it was Jess . " The most moving thing was the kid that grabbed my hand , " said Nixon .                 @ @ @ @
