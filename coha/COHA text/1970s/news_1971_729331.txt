txt Governor Rockefeller conceded today that conservative Republicans " got their pound of flesh " but he said that the battle over his budget was not ended . In an impromptu hallway interview at the Capitol , Mr. Rockefeller strongly hinted that he would seek to reinstate some of the $760-million cut from his proposed $8.45-billion budget . He said he would try to restore state revenue-sharing aid to New York City and other localities and would attempt to soften the impact of a 10 per cent across-theboard cut in allowances for welfare recipients in the metropolitan area . However , the Governor indicated that he would not resist another major cutback , the laying off of up to 10,000 stateworkers . " Ten thousand state employes who were working yesterday will not be working at this time next year , " he said . ' Previously , legislative budget cutters had , that only 8,400 jobs would be involved and that at least half of them were either vacant or merely proposed jobs . The restoration of the revenue sharing and other unspecified cuts might be financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , beer and liquor taxes . These increases had been considered as part of the Governor 's original tax package but were dropped this week in the bargaining between legislative leaders and the Governor . A total of $75-million was cut in state revenue-sharing aid to localities ; New York City would receive $48-million of that amount . The aid was reduced when the Legislature cut the localities ' share of state income tax revenue from 21 to 18 per cent . The Governor is likely to seek as much as $200-million in additional funds before the end of the current legislative session . The $7.7-billion budet was enacted by the Legislature earlier today . The Governor hopes to restore some of the cuts in welfare allowances by obtaining Federal money for an experimental welfare program based on his proposal that full benefits be given to welfare recipients who are either seeking work , working or studying as well as dependent children , the aged and the blind . The experimental program would be confined to the metropolitan area , where welfare recipients were hit hardest by the 10 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened by the Legislature 's mandating a statewide welfare standard . This resulted in increased allowances for upstate residents , who received less tip welfare recipients in the New York City area . Mr. Rockefeller denied that he had agreed entirely to a paper circulated by Syracuse Republicans that included as a demand for approval of the budget a provision that there would be no restorations of funds in the supplemental budget and no additional revenues . He noted that funds could be restored without resorting to the supplemental budget and that he merely agreed he had " no plans for additional revenues . " It was apparent that Mr. Rockefeller was leaving himself room to maneuver. 14-Hour Session The Governor appeared fresh and relaxed although he had spent until early today , a total of 14 hours , in the office of Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges trying to break the impasse that had blocked enactment of a state budget in time for the start of a new fiscal year . The year began Thursday . Mr. Rockefeller also appeared optimistic although many legislators on both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setback when he had to bow to the massive budget cuts demanded by conservative Republicans . The Governor said he had to deal with conservative Republicans because " Stanley 's price was too high . " He pulled out of his pocket a slip of paper with the figure $480-million to back his point that Assembly Minority Leader Stanley Steingut , Democrat of Brooklyn , had demanded restoration of $480-million in cuts as the price for Democratic support of the budget . The Governor said that if he had bowed to that demand , he would have lost scores ' of Republican votes and shattered G.O.P. unity . He indicated that he hoped to use the legislative pressure for governmental economy to slow the rate of state spending and expansion . " This will be a period of consolidation , sorting out , " ? he said . Funds for University Rockefeller aides said later that the expansion of the State University , which now has 200,000 students , would be slowed so as not to jeopardize private colleges and universities as well as to save money . They also predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employes , the university and mental hospitals represent two of the biggest agencies in the state government . The administration aides indicated that they expected similar belt-tightening from New York City and other localities . One aide said that 10,000 state layoffs represented about 7 per cent of the state 's 144,000 employes . He noted that a similar layoff of New York City 's 270,000 workers , exclusive of teaching personnel , would amount to 18,900 workers . The city laid off 500 workers in December . The Governor said that although state school aid was not cut in the budget largely because of the determined opposition of suburban Republican legislators , he and the Legislature intended to monitor closely the effectiveness of the education dollar or what he referred to as " cost-benefit ratios . " The Governor conceded that he had not expected the intense reaction to his budget by the Legislature . He noted that he had received " only 8,000 letters opposed to the budget while his office has been deluged with about 17,000 letters supporting additional state aid for parochial schools . The Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has proposed a series of welfare revision bills and accepted the massive cuts in welfare and state aid to localities . He noted that at about midnight last night , State Senator Robert Garcia , Democrat of the Bronx , whom he described as a friend , had visited Mr. Rockefeller in Senator Brydges 's office . He said that Mr. Garcia had accused him of " betraying " his liberal principles . " I can understand how he felt , but I told him I have n't changed , and that he should have faith , " the Governor said as he turned to go back to his office .
