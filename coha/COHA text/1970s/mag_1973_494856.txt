DECEMBER 29 , 1973 down at us . Abraham Lincoln : Thank you . Question : How do you think history will treat you ? Abraham Lincoln : I 'm less worried about history , to tell you the honest truth , now than I am about the future . But I do , would like to recall , as a little closing here , to let you know that my mind is always thinking about problems , in trying to understand them , I did sit in his lap once in our home and he had been over in Africa and been bringing back big game alive and I had been thinking a lot about it , and so I said , " The one thing I ca n't figure out is how did you bring the giraffes back on those flat cars when you went through a tunnel ? " And he was marvelous and warm and friendly , and he said , " We had a pulley. and we 'd pull their heads down before we went through the tunnel . " Question : Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No , sir . He was no longer President and at that point I was n't too sharply focused on those political problems . I was more interested in the con ? servation aspects of our society . Few people got excited when the Congress of 1862 passed Justin Morrill 's bill giving the states parcels of federal land to endow new agricultural and mechanical colleges . The New York Tribune , summarizing the ses ? sion 's achievements , did n't consider it important enough to mention . Yet Morrill 's land-grant bill ? riding the tide of Jacksonian democracy , westward expansion and the agricultural and industrial revolu ? tions ? hurried along the development of , a remarkable set of colleges and universities . In time , these institu ? tions ? places like the University of California or Missouri or North Carolina ? became the social ladders on which the sons and daughters of the lower middle class climbed into the professions . They took green farmboys and made them competent engineers , the sons of small merchants and trained them as lawyers , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did it by maintaining reason ? ably democratic admissions standards and low costs . As late , as 10 years ago a state resident paid only $304 a year in undergraduate tuition and fees at the Uni ? versity of California . At Missouri $215 , and at North Carolina $279 . The national average for institutions of their type was $280 . Figuring in room and board , a year of education cost around $1000 . In the past decade , however , their tuition gradually rose as these institutions slapped together dormitories and classrooms to handle thousands of new students , hired more professors and increased their salaries , and tried to prove to the Ivy League that the colleges of the common man could be first class . By last fall tuition and fees were up to $638 at California , $540 at Missouri and $439 at North Carolina . Nationally the median charge was around $520 a year ? still something of a bargain . That $520 covered only about a sixth of what a student 's education actually cost ; most of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxes paid by those upwardly mobile engineers , law ? yers and schoolteachers . This has been the accepted way of financing public higher education . This low-tuition policy is now being challenged . The debate over its wisdom is laid out in two influential study commission reports : Higher Education : Who Pays ? Who Benefits ? Who Should Pay ? by the Carnegie Cominission on Higher Education ( see TNR , Oct. 20 , 1973 ) and The Management and Financing of Colleges by the business-dominated Committee for Economic Development ( CED ) . Both urge a substantial boost in tuition at the public institutions . The Carnegie pro ? posal envisions a less drastic rise than the CED 's ? about 10 to 12 percent a year over the next decade . The reaction has been swift and angry . The CED proposal is " extremely dangerous , " says AFL-CIO President George Meany , and would " shatter the hopes of workers to insure that their children have the advan ? tages of higher education . " It reflects " the vested in ? terest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected , " says the president of the National Student Association . " As long as I am chair ? man of the House subcommittee that writes legislation on student aid , " says Rep. James O'Hara ( D , Mich . ) , " I can assure the good people at the Carnegie Commis ? sion and the Committee for Economic Development that I am going to be very inhospitable to such pro ? posals . " Both of the Washington-based associations that look after the interests of the public institutions , the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges ( 130 members ) and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities ( 310 members ) , have rushed to defend low tuition . To understand the arguments , we have to go back a bit and pick up a couple of the major shifts that have taken place since World War II . For one thing the country 's private institutions have begun to suffer financially ; the very existence of some is threatened . Because they rely on tuition income to cover about 60 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs have risen ? to raise tuition . From the fall of 1964 to the fall of 1971 their average tuition nationally rose from $979 a year to $1776 , and it 's higher now . The gap between this rate and what the public institutions charge means that the private 12 schools are at a big disadvantage in recruiting stu ? dents . Faced with paying $2690 a year at Boston Unit versity or $520 at the University of Massachusetts , for instance , a parent may well wonder whether there 's that much difference in quality or prestige , if any . Many private institutions have empty seats in their classrooms , and the declining birthrate alone suggests that their plight will get worse . In the last couple of decades the public sector has become the dominant partner in the higher education enterprise . Public institutions enrolled just about half of all students in 1950 ; now they have three-fourths . Public institutions ? some of which have become more prestigious and higher quality than some of their private counterparts ? now accommodate students from virtually all social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , 12 percent of the fresh ? men in the fall of 1972 estimated that their families earned more than $40,000 a year ; 43 percent put their parents in the over-$20,000 bracket . At the same . time , despite recent gains by minorities , the children of families that earn less than $10,000 a year are still significantly underrepresented on college campuses . ( The reasons of course , are only partly lack of moriey ; going to college may have more to do with whether one was put in the college-prep " track " in high school . ) Given these trends the strategy of the Carnegie Commission and the CED is twofold : 1 ) Raise tuition and 2 ) provide adequate federal scholarships for the poor . Beyond this general agreement there are impor ? tant differences . Carnegie would raise charges until they cover about a third ? of the cost of instruction ( compared to the current one-sixth ) ; CED wants them pegged at 50 percent of costs . Carnegie would string the increase out over 10 years ; CED would spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the community colleges . The CED would keep the amount of tax money spent on higher education about the same as now , the extra dollars the colleges collect in tuition would be about all the new money that would be available for expanded student aid . Carnegie , on the other hand , would pour not only the extra tuition money into student aid , but additional millions in federal dollars as well . The Carnegie ' report , which is the more detailed of the two , argues that its two-pronged policy would more equitably distribute the costs and benefits of higher education among the social classes than does the low-tuition device . The more affluent students ( say those with family incomes of $15,000 a year or more ) would n't be eligible for scholarships and would be forced to pay more nearly in line with their family capabilities . Poorer students ( roughly those from fam ? ilies under $12,000 a year ) would get scholarships . Students in the middle range ( $12,000 to $15,000 ) would have to pay for their education out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case rests on THE NEW REPUBLIC the argument that many families can now afford higher tuition rates because their disposable incomes have ( until very recently ) been outstripping the rise in tuition . Another major argument is that increased public tuition would help save the private colleges , which are viewed as an important source of diversity . If the private institutions keep their own tuition increases to about six percent a year , raising public tuition to one-third of costs would narrow the troublesome " tuition gap " from the current 4 to 1 to about 2112 to 1 by 1983 . This new ratio , it is thought , would enable private institutions to compete for students more successfully . The most formidable assault on this entire approach has come from the AASCU institutions , which are mostly ex-teachers ' colleges with big middle-class clienteles . ( Sixty percent of their students come from families that earn between $8000 and $20,000 a year . ) Raising their rates would be vastly unfair to the middle class ( $10,000 to $15,000 a year ) , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition would mean that the well-to-do , who could get the money from home , would graduate debt free ; the low-income could get scholarships and also graduate without the burden of debt ; but middle-class students , unable to get either , would be forced to use up family savings ( if any ) or borrow heavily and spend their 20s paying back loans . That , the public institutions argue , is stick ? ing it to the middle class . It is also unfair , say the public institutions , to expect their students to pay higher rates to save the private sector . That amounts to taxing the six million students in public institutions to bail out colleges that enroll only two million . This makes about as much sense , says one president of a state university , " as forcing one person to undergo surgery because another per ? son has appendicitis . " It would be better to help the private institutions through direct institutional aid or through scholarships targeted for their students . Another point raised by the public institutions is the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught between the two prongs of the Carnegie-CED policy ? tuition might go up , but student aid might not . Tuition rates and the funding of stu ? dent-aid programs involve decisions by scores of people ? officials of federal agencies like the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Education , Congress , governors and state legislators , university trustees and administrators , voters in community col ? lege districts , and private bankers . The great danger , the public institutions believe , is that hard-pressed or fiscally conservative politicians might raise tuition and not use the revenue for student aid . As an example of how student-aid funds are subject to shifting political and economic winds , one could cite the fate of the Basic Opportunity Grants program established by Congress in 1972 as part of a revised DECEMBER 29 , 1973 higher education act . The program authorized up to $1400 a year in aid for every student ? minus whatever his family could be expected to contribute , given its income . But the appropriation level in the current year is so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $260 . The debate goes on . In a few weeks the National Commission on the Financing of Postsecondary , Edu ? 13 cation , set up to study alternatives to financial arrange ? ments in the 1972 legislation , will report to the President and Congress . And that should heat up the controversy a few more degrees . Ralph G. Newman is a respected appraiser of historic books , manuscripts and archives . Edward L. Morgan is now an assistant secretary of the Treasury but until this year he had served in the White House as a deputy counsel to President Nixon . Frank DeMarco is a Cali ? fornia lawyer who , since 1969 , has handled Mr. Nix ? on 's taxes . Each is unknown to most Americans , but the chances are growing that as Mr. Nixon 's taxes are thoroughly investigated in the coming months , these gentlemen will become as recognizable as Rose Mary Woods and J. Fred Buzhardt , whose fame spread dur ? ing the inquiry into the 18-minute gap on the White House tapes . As with the tapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift in 1969 of pre-pres ? idential papers valued at $576,000 , require a suspen ? sion of disbelief . And as with the tape gap , there is the possibility that a criminal act was involved . In his November 17 appearance before the Asso ? ciated Press managing editors , the President made one of his typical , misleading **25;2496;TOOLONG why he paid less than $1000 in taxes on an earned per ? sonal income of over $250,000 in 1970 and 1971 , he said it was " not because of the deductions for . . . gim ? micks " ; it , was because Lyndon Johnson " came in to see me . . . and he told me that under the law , up until 1969 , presidential and vice presidential papers given to the government were a deduction and should be taken , and could be taken as a deduction from the tax . " Having credited the original idea to Johnson , Mr. Nixon went on to say he turned his papers " over to the tax people . . They appraised them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns , they " took that as a deduction . " But as can be seen from an inspection of those returns , as well as documents placed in the Congressional Record by Senator Lowell Weicker ( who has run his own investigation ) and interviews with various participants , the matter of the tax deduct ? ible papers is far more complex than the President 's words would suggest . Sometime after his election in 1968 , Mr. Nixon and then President Johnson apparently did discuss the donation of papers . Johnson had since 1965 been avail ? ing himself of this " gimmick " to lower his taxable in ? come . It was a simple thing : a public official had papers ; he offered them to an educational institution or the government ; the recipient put them in order and some ? one was brought in to appraise their value . Then , based on the appraised value and the donor 's taxable income , all the papers were turned over at once , or given over a number of years with the deduction spread out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1968 , Mr. Nixon or one of his aides got in touch with Mr. Newman , whose place of business is in Chicago . Newman had performed similar services for President Johnson . Around December 20 Mr. Newman went to New York City and reportedly identified do ? natable materials belonging to Mr. Nixon which were kept in the offices of Nixon 's law firm and in a New York warehouse . Since the end of the tax year was fast approaching , a deed to this material was drawn up , supplemented by a list of 21 specifically identified car ? tons of paperS , letters , books , tapes and memorabilia from various parts of Mr. Nixon 's career . The deed turned the listed material over to the US government but reserved to the donor , Mr. Nixon , the right to limit
