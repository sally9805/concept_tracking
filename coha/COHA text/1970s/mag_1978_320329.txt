BLOODBROTHERS <P> Directed by Robert Mulligan Screenplay by Walter Newman <P> In the heyday of Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck , Hollywood beguiled audiences with sentimental tales of working-class women who dreamed of escape to a better life . These days the genre lives on , but in a much revised form . Instead of women , the protagonists of these films are now men , young Italian studs who break out of ethnic urban ghettos to become Somebodies . It 's a formula that has already produced a pair of smash movies , Rocky and Saturday Night Fever , as well as new stars to go with them . Bloodbrothers is the latest entry in this sweepstakes , and it too has a fresh young actor , Richard Gere , in the lead . If lightning fails to strike a third time , it is not that the formula is tired ; it 's that Bloodbrothers is a mess . <P> Gere plays Stony De Coco , a 19-year-old who still lives with his suffocating parents in the antiseptic , concrete high-rises of The Bronx . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or should he follow his desires and become a white-collar counselor to infirm children ? A simple dilemma , but Bloodbrothers takes forever to resolve it . There is so much clutter in this movie that it is often difficult to find Stony amidst the underbrush . <P> Screenwriter Walter Newman , adapting Richard Price 's tough novel , has no use for dramatic efficiency or synthesis . Besides Stony 's story , he tells in lavish detail the histrionic tales of the hero 's psychotic mother ( Lelia Goldoni ) , his anorectic kid brother ( Michael Hershewe ) , his sexually troubled dad ( Tony Lo Bianco ) and his defeated uncle ( Paul Sorvino ) . Newman , like Price , wants to make a larger sociological point about the breakdown of oldtime immigrant values in chaotic modern America , but he overstates the case . Bloodbrothers has so much narrative , most of it melodramatic , that every scene becomes a climax , every speech a tragic monologue . Each psycho logical motive is spelled out ; no events are left to the audience 's imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually start to question their authenticity . The film 's ending- true to formula but false to Price 's novel - destroys whatever credibility remains . <P> Robert Mulligan ( Summer of ' 42 ) can be a first-rate film maker , but his world here suffers from a bad miscalculations . Trying for what appears to be an expressionistic style , he has directed the movie at a screeching pitch . He matches the script 's verbal and physical violence blow for blow with slam-bang editing and ; pounding musical score ; he never give the audience a chance to catch its breath . What is intended to be operatic come out overblown and , at times , overacted Goldoni 's Mom is so crazed she seems to have stepped out of Exorcist II .
