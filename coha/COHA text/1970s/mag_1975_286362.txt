TRAVESTIES by TOM STOPPARD <P> This is a tinderbox of a play blazing with wit , paradox , parody and , yes , ideas . It is exhilaratingly , diabolically clever . The bloodline of Wilde and Shaw is not extinct while Tom Stoppard lives . <P> The playwright 's fancy was taken by the fact that three revolutionaries of vastly differing temperaments and persuasions lived contiguously in Zurich during World War I. They were Tristan Tzara , Rumanian poet and founder of Dadaism , James Joyce and Lenin . There is no evidence that they ever met each other , but in Travesties , they do . Stoppard was further intrigued by a suit filed against Joyce by one Henry Carr for the price of a pair of trousers . A minor British consular official , Carr had purchased the trousers to play Algernon Moncrieff in The Importance of Being Earnest for a Joyce-managed troupe called the English Players . <P> Exile , to some degree , is Stoppard 's abiding theme . Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is exile through ignorance . The two mini-heroes do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . No one can clearly divine his purposes or verify his existence . Travesties is exile by intent , a rebellion against social traditions and aesthetic norms . Travesties , a play-within-a-monologue , begins with the age-frazzled Carr ( John Wood ) reminiscing intimately about the famed Zurich trio in a way that illustrates a perennial travesty : the ravages of time on memory . What follows is part vaudeville , part nonstop debate and part instant replay of Wilde 's play with absurdist variations . <P> Joyce ( James Booth ) appears wearing a jacket with shamrocks on it , spouts limerick after limerick and intermittently becomes Lady Bracknell . Tzara ( Tim Curry ) comes on with a pair of scissors , slices up a Shakespeare sonnet , dumps the lines into a top hat , and extrapolates them as gibberish to show that antiart reigns supreme . In the Wildean substructure of Travesties , Tzara doubles as John Worthing ( Earnest in town-Jack in the country ) . Carr once again plays his friend Algy . Lenin ( Harry Towb ) has no role in Earnest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of an artist in a workers ' state , but later tearfully melts at the playing of Beethoven 's Appassionato . <P> <P> Stop-motion devices , relished by Stoppard , telescope , bisect or reverse the flow of time . The sound of a cuckoo clock , which Stoppard treats as the Swiss national anthem , periodically suspends the action , and the same opening lines of dialogue lead into an entirely different episode . One scene has Joyce arguing that no one would have been remotely aware of the Trojan War had it not been for Homer , a dozen other artists , and his own upcoming Ulysses . Scarcely a word is uttered without a play on it . A few of the puns are punishing , but most of the word play is daffily delicious , as for instance , " My art belongs to Dada . " <P> In an evening that is a dance of delight , and thanks to Director Peter Wood an astute lesson in the choreography of thought , there is only one segment that falters with a portentous sobriety .
