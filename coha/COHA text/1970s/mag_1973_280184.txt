He likes to call himself " Big Al . " He is a beefy , publicity-shy , self-made millionaire . He is also a personal financier to President Nixon . This man , Robert H. Abplanalp , 51 , has found himself increasingly in the public eye-a position he ordinarily avoids-since it was learned that he lent $625,000 toward Nixon 's purchase of property in San Clemente . How did Abplanalp become the President 's silent business partner , and what holds their relationship together ? <P> Abplanalp ( the name is pronounced Abplanalp and means in Swiss-German " from flat mountain " ) has long had a taste for conservative causes and candidates . He was a strong Nixon supporter in the 1960 campaign , but the two men did not meet until 1963 , when Nixon moved to Manhattan to practice law . In a restaurant , Abplanalp went up to shake Nixon 's hand and said that he thought Nixon had been " robbed " in the 1960 election . The two struck up a friendship , and Nixon started going on vacation retreats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nixon 's law firm also began to represent Abplanalp 's business , Precision Valve Corp. , in its dealings overseas . <P> Several times a year the two men go on fishing trips aboard Abplanalp 's 55-ft. yacht , often taking along their mutual friend , Bebe Rebozo . Sometimes their families join in . Abplanalp met his wife Josephine when she worked for one of his suppliers of plastics . They have two teen-age children , John and Marie . Describing his family , Abplanalp says : " I found a beautiful broad who 's a great mother-and I 've got two kids . " <P> On the relaxed , informal yacht trips , says Abplanalp , the men rarely talk politics , but the cruises offer Nixon a chance to swap fishing and sports stories with his friends . Since Nixon took office , Abplanalp 's two-story , eight-bed room house on Grand Cay has been refurbished and enlarged . The President uses the master suite while there and often works during the early morning hours in the attached private study . Besides fishing , Nixon rides around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shark-filled waters-always , of course , under close watch by Secret Service agents . <P> Abplanalp was born in The Bronx to Swiss immigrant parents . His father was a machinist who instilled in his son a liking for gadgetry and tinkering . Abplanalp studied engineering at Villanova , but dropped out to open his own machine shop . After he returned from World War II to find his shop had fallen $10,000 in debt , he slowly began to work his way out . One day , a customer brought in an aerosol spray can with an expensive but unreliable valve that had leaked . Abplanalp began thinking of ways to solve the problem , and eventually designed a new , less leak-prone valve .
