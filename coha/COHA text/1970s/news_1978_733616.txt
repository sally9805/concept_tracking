FRIEDENBERG ... pg . 23 Tgh Lck , Rdrs Say In an ' Op-Ed article on April 29 ( " Lawyr , 25 , Wnts Jb , Phila. ; Drs Clsd " ) , Scott M. Olin described his difficulties and feelings after having been unable for 18 months to land a job with a law firm : " The whole experience has left me with a growing anger and resentment toward anybody 50 years old or older . " He cited his academic qualifications and asserted that it was now " our turn " ? young people 's turn  --  to have a ticket " into the system " in order to reap its benefits . He described himself as a clerk for the Federal Government . The article drew a number of- replies , some of which appear below . To the Editor : I read with bitter amusement the tribulations of Scott Olin attempting to find employment as an attorney . At least he obtained some kind of position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any kind of job . People with honors ' degrees , Ph.D.s from Ivy League universities , books and articles wait year after year for part-time and temporary posts . Meanwhile the tenure ranks are choked with hordes of middle-aged and older professors , some without Ph.D.s ; many not having published anything . They flock to conventions , where they can hold court over thousands of groveling applicants for nonexistent jobs . Then the older professors return to their low-interest mortgages and their faculty club privileges and forget all about the professions which gave them such a good life . Bitter ? You bet I am ; bitter enough to say " Down with the Gerontocracy . " CARL DIEHL West Hartford , Conn. a To the Editor : In answer to Scott M. Olin 's article : I do n't feel sorry for you : your problem is that you feel sorry for yourself . " Our turn , " you say  --  resentment and jealousy for people who have had " 30 years of unlimited prosperity . " If this is the feeling of the youth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really think things were easy for us 30 years ago ? Do you really think that it was any different for us 30 years ago ? Do you really think that in 1948 jobs were plentiful ? Young men came out of the Army , expecting great things , having fought for their country , only to find no jobs . Sure , you went to a university , only to find you were overeducated and could n't even land an ordinary job . The market was oversaturated with men , out of the Army , looking for ? work . And what was the pay ? $35 was gcod money ; prosperity on $35 ; we could n't afford a house either , not even an elevator apartment . Sure we had talent , skill and brains , but no opportunity to use them . The youth of today thinks that everything was handed to us on a silver platter . Well , you are wrong ; we worked hard , very hard , and after 30 years of hard work and saving we have finally made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own house . But nobody gave us anything , it was a long , hard struggle . Be glad you have a job , work hard , keep trying . But do n't blame those who came before you for not giving you a chance . ANITA STEIN Chappaqua , N.Y . To the Editor : Scott , you 're really breaking my heart . However , in your case I think the marketplace has rightly rejected what you 're selling . I have yet to meet a ' law student besides yourself who somehow missed the news that new lawyers are in vast oversupply , and have been for some years , The Department of Labor publishes the ' statistics , the American Bar Association publicizes the fact , law schools disseminate the information , and word-of-mouth gets to the rest of us . Where were you ? If you 're half as sharp as you hold yourself out to be , you should have known that fact , and you should n't be heard now to complain about it . Last year at least 26,400 graduates found jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Probably a willingness to search ' for jobs in firms without Patriarchs , as you put it . ROBERT M. BARRETT Bethesda , Md . ? To the Editor : Assuming that Scott Olin is correct and that , based upon his impressive credentials , the world does owe him a living ( even if he is white with curly hair ) , one wonders about that legal education . In graduating from law school with honors , did he never encounter any law or cases dealing with the rights of creditors ? It is not enough . Mr. Olin , that a debtor owes you : You may have to take affirmative steps to collect . If the debt is a valid one , collection may not be too difficult , but you have to do something  --  and something appropriate to collection . But poor Mr. Olin says he ca n't even get his foot in the door . He ca n't ? By his own account , he did . He got his foot in the door and Used it to kick the senior partner in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable lob for his talents ! JOHNS . HOGG Hamilton , N.Y . To the Editor : In answer to Scott M. Olin , his diatribe against the older generation for not moving over to give young lawyers such as him ( 25 ) a chance to acquire , as he says " in a society that respects job salary and advancement , material possessions , a home in the suburbs and two cars , I have none , " we ' urge him to raise his sights . This society does not need more lawyers milking the public for their selfish ends . Why not try to change the whole profession into the honorable state it was meant to be , serving the common good . to improve the condition of man ? M. MOKAREEI . New York City To the Editor : As I read the sad tale of the young man with a pocketful of degrees , Phi Beta Kappa , member of the bar , I wept uncontrollably . Had to dab my eyes before biting off the top of a new J &B; bottle before responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed ? " Only has a miserable Government job . Now here is a boy who really has suffered . My heart bleeds for a young man , so deserving , with three awards , no less , and honors , because ? he can not even get his foot in the door . Before starting the second bottle , I hereby appoint myself as spokesman for those who had the privilege of graduating from high school during the 1928-1935 period , even as late as 1940 . Those were the dandy old days when engineers , Ph.D . ' s , lawyers could be hired for $25 per week . I knew boys just out of school who could n't get a job for three years ? no nothing ? no welfare , no Government jobs . So here conies a 25-year-old whiz who finds himself " sandbagged into a deadend job . " How can I stop these tears ? they are filling my slippers . Without attempting to place laurels on my aging brow , I would point out to the sufferer that at his age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately leading . to a law degree , after some eight years , five nights a week and study every weekend , thankful to have a job . And there were many , many more who did as much or more , without all the breastbeating business . I finally got my foot in a door and so ' did most of the others , although it took time . Now , at the grand age of 25 , you are left " with a growing anger and resentment toward anybody 50 years or older . " One week in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania some 50 years ago , with kids working in the mines at the age of 14 and 15 , would give you more perspective than you ever got in working on whatever miserable thesis you ever worked on to reach your remarkable scholastic achievements . H. D. FRIEDENBERO Cape May , N.J. To the Editor : Now , if Scott Olin had the good fortune to have been born in 1920 , he might have found employment on . the beaches of Normandy , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have continued his studies alongside the Yalu River . Were he to have been born in 1950 and not traveled the university road , he would have found work somewhere between Hanoi and Saigon , Poor Scott Olin , at 25 " sandbagged Into a dead-end job . " Like Miniver Cheevv , he was born ton late . G. J. LEDERMAN Brooklyn , N.Y .
