txt Should the United States give money to foreign friends ? By now , 30 years and billions of dollars after the Marshall Plan , almost everyone would find it easy to say yes . But change the question slightly and it becomes troublesome indeed : Should the United States give money to foreign friends secretly ? The issue arises in the wake of reports that for years King Hussein of Jordan and other foreign leaders have received funds from the United States , all in secret . It is the secrecy that explains much of the consequent turmoil . In the words of one Washington authority , " The brown paper bag is more of a problem than the money . " Even if such payments were reasonable and justifiable , they are vulnerable to the most cynical interpretation of bald bribery and sordid interventionism . That makes it clear and appealing to conclude that such conduct should be flatly prohibited , that the United States should not stoop to bribery or even the appearance of bribery . To do so , it could be argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrages against foreign governments ; to risk taint by association with activities that escape American control ; to set a fetid example for businesses operating abroad . The problem with this line of argument is that it is absolute . In condemning what appears to be immorality , whether in Jordan or elsewhere , it is important not to condemn too much . One can easily imagine circumstances that would put this position to a severe test ? one which it might well fail . Assume , hypothetically , an African country torn by racial and factional strife . Assume further that competent American officials become persuaded that the leader of one faction could successfully organize a coherent government , sparing protracted bloodshed and international unrest affecting the United States  --  if he had secret access to , say , $500,000 . And assume that he could not , for reasons of political appearances , accept an open American payment . Depending on the facts , an American President might approve or reject such a payment . The key phrase is depending on the facts . He should not flatly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , as well as American self-interest , he should retain discretion to use clandestine payments as an instrument of foreign policy . Throwing money around , especially in bidding contests between superpowers , may be seamy . But is it not preferable to bidding conducted in the coin of arms ? We come to this conclusion uneasily and with qualifications . Once the gates of pragmatism are inched open , the ethos of the shadowy intelligence world creates a pressure unsatisfied until they are flung wide . Hence the qualifications . The President should lay down guidelines , however difficult to frame , limiting the types of payments permissible . There should be a showing that payments can not be made openly  --  a requirement which would minimize the need to channel funds through the Central Intelligence Agency . Payment proposals should be reviewed by senior officials as well as the President . Such qualifications would not be proof against abuses . The attention of senior officials shifts ; renewals of permission have a way of becoming perfunctory . Even so , qualified discretion is preferable to unqualified morality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great .
