A former San Francisco official kills the mayor and a supervisor <P> The gathering constellation of torchlights nickered first at the corner of 18th and Castro streets , in the center of the homosexual community that makes up about one-eighth of San Francisco 's population . Held high by marchers stepping to the slow cadence of three drums , the bobbing lights moved down Market Street , their brilliance growing as the grieving crowd multiplied . By the time they reached the steps of the bronze-domed city hall , the crowd of youthful homosexuals , male and female , had been joined by many more conventional citizens , and an army of some 30,000 mourners expressed the sorrow of the shaken city . <P> At the flower-strewn steps , the mood of the civil rights rebellion of the 1960s was evoked as the crystalline voice of Folk Singer Joan Baez led the assembled marchers in the familiar songs : Kumbaya , Amazing Grace and Oh , Freedom . More candles were lit , more wreaths dropped on the steps , and an undercurrent of bitterness broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked one crudely lettered sign in cruel reference to homosexuality 's hated foe , Anita Bryant . <P> Once stately and even staid , a very citadel of culture in California , San Francisco has been scarred repeatedly in recent years by outbreaks of violence and turmoil ( see following story ) . It was horrified two weeks ago when it awoke to the realization that it had nourished the Peoples Temple , an ostensibly humanitarian and religious cult whose leader , Jim Jones , had ordered the assassination of California Congressman Leo Ryan and then led 911 followers to their deaths in a frenzy of mass suicide and murder in remote Guyana . But San Francisco 's shock was more centrally focused last week from the moment when a tearful Dianne Feinstein , president of the board of supervisors , stepped outside her city hall office to tell a stunned group of city employees and reporters : " It is my duty to inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed . " <P> Mayor George Moscone , 49 , had learned only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he had once appointed head of the city housing authority , and of the other Guyana victims . " I proceeded to vomit and cry , " Moscone had said . Supervisor Harvey Milk , 48 , who had spoken at political rallies at the Peoples Temple , had candidly proclaimed his homosexuality and won election to the city 's eleven-member governing board . He had also left a tape recording predicting that he might be killed because he had become such a prominent political spokesman for gays . The man charged with killing the other two was not some wild-eyed lunatic but an ex-member of the board of supervisors , Daniel James White , 32 . White was a clean-cut former police officer and fireman , who was described by most acquaintances as a handsome , athletic , ever-achieving all-American boy . " If he had been a breakfast cereal , " said one acquaintance , " he would have had to be Wheaties . " <P>
