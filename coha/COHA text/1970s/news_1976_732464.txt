txt The trucking settlement reached over the weekend in the United States is expected to influence other unions this year in three major ways : 1 . Other unions which face wage bargaining this year will follow the Teamsters ' lead and press for full ( " uncapped " ) cost-of-living adjustment clauses . This could mean strikes by rubber , electrical manufacturing , and other workers . The key to the tentative settlement was the industry 's reluctant agreement to make unlimited adjustments in pay as prices rise during the new contract period . A new formula will provide increases of 1 cent in pay for every . 0.4 point rise in living costs in the second contract year ( long considered standard in auto , steel , and other contracts ) , then 1 ' cent for every 0.3 point rise in the third year . The third-year formula is the one now in effect in auto and several other large union contracts : 2 . The rubber industry can not escape added pressures this month for comparably large gains in paychecks .

This increase would not include cost-ofliving adjustments . 4 . Employers in other industries where bargaining is under way or just ahead see in the Teamsters ' negotiating tactics a union precedent for whipsaw or divide-and-conquer bargaining tactics . When national bargaining deadlocked in trucking , the Teamsters sought and won agreements from several large groups of employers to sign probational contracts ? pacts that could be revised later when the national agreement came . These agreements that kept large numbers of trucks on the road undercut the major bargaining in Arlington Heights , Illinois , and speeded the industrywide agreement last weekend . This pattern could be followed by other unions . Meanwhile , for the Ford administration the settlement came as good political news . Mide from the avoidance of a very costly strike , the agreement meant that President Ford would not have to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act 's national emergency strike injunction to force trucks back on the road .

Tens of thousands of workers in other industries , particularly in the auto industry , will not be.laid off or , at worst , face a loss of only one or two days of work and pay periods . Equally important , deliveries to plants and shops will not be cut off . Each day of a trucking strike would have cost business and industry ? and the public ? multimillions of dollars . Trucking costs will rise sharply . This means rising charges to all who- ship by truck ? and higher costs for consumers as freight rate increases are passed along . This will be inflationary .
