Once while sitting as a trial judge , Chief Justice Warren Burger listened patiently as a young prosecutor presented nearly an hour of expert testimony on fingerprint evidence . Burger naturally assumed that the case would hinge on a disputed fingerprint . To his consternation , he eventually discovered that the fingerprint was not in question at all ; the defense accepted it . Not for the first or last time , Burger had been victimized by a familiar courtroom figure : the inept trial attorney . <P> Unsure of himself and his field , such a lawyer often bogs courts down in otiose efforts to cover every unthought-of contingency ; or , at the opposite extreme , he may sink a client 's case by missing a critical point . After 42 years as a practicing lawyer and judge , Burger has sadly concluded that perhaps as many as one-half of all lawyers who appear in American courts are incompetent . Last week , in a speech at Fordham Law School , the Chief declared that it was high time special additional training and testing be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In fact , most of the 355,000 lawyers in the U.S. rarely enter a courtroom ; they stay in their offices drawing up contracts , wills or divorce papers . But any U.S. lawyer is entitled to practice any kind of law he wishes . As a result , said the unhappy Chief , " The courtrooms of America all too often have ' Piper Cub ' advocates trying to handle the controls of ' Boeing 747 ' litigation . " <P> British Model . Burger urged that the regular law school course of three years be compressed into two , so that a third year for prospective trial lawyers could be devoted to courtroom training . He also suggested that this third year be followed by a few years of apprentice practice not unlike medical residency programs . <P> Burger 's legal model is the British system , under which some 300,000 solicitors defer to 3,000 barristers for all courtroom advocacy . The resulting professionalism speeds the trial process and tends to prevent a case turning primarily on the uneven skills of opposing advocates . Critics contend that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than fight for the best interests of clients . But Burger feels that too many U.S. lawyers push the adversary system to the other extreme and brawl to an unreasonable degree that wastes court time . <P> Many lawyers were pleased that someone of the Chiefs stature had finally addressed the problem . " Judges and lawyers have been talking about this privately for years , " commented Federal Appeals Court Judge Irving Kaufman , " but they 've hesitated to say it publicly . " Most attorneys who now specialize in trial work will doubtless support the proposal ; for opponents , Burger had a warning : " The views of practitioners who are affected can not be controlling any more than we allow the automobile or drug industry to have control of safety or public health standards . There are ' consumers ' of justice whose rights and interests must have protection . "
