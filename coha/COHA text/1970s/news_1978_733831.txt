txt CHICAGOANS grousing about the heat and humidity on Tuesday , when temperatures rose to 90 degrees for the seventh time this month , might contemplate the contrast with the weather a year ago . On the same date in 1977 , the high reached only 73 , with a low of 61 . Tuesday the temperature pushed within three degrees of the all-time record for Sept. 19 of 93 set in 1953 . And the 90-degree reading held steady for four hours at Midway Airport , between 2 and 6 p.m . It was the 10th day of 90-degree or above temperatures this year . The annual average is 22 . BUT COOL weather is coming , and by the weekend it may be time to haul out sweaters and relight the furnace . Rain moving over the area Wednesday night and Thursday is expected to quench the heat wave , and for the next five days temperatures are not likely to rise much above 70 . A decided nip in the air may accompany the first night of autumn , which officially arrives Saturday .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
