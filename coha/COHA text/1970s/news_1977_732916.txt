txt President Ford says that " the demands of a vigorous campaign " may have prevented the firming up of an arms-limitation agreement with the Soviets . He discloses he may have missed SALT II because of the " hiatus " created by the campaign . He also says that the apprehension of the business community over the possibility of a Democratic president contributed to the lull in the economy and that this may have cost him the election . Additionally , Mr. Ford warns against the return of the " imperial presidency " and says : " I think the American public wants a continuation of a non-imperial presidency . I think any president who comes in and reverts to or begins an imperial presidency will be harshly treated , by the American people . " Asked here if there was " a temptation for a president to be overly impressed with his position and potential power , " the President said , " You have to guard against it every day . " In his final interview before leaving office , the President was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bantered . On several occasions he filled the Oval Office with his hearty laughter . He clearly was exiting with good humor and in good spirits . ? // By R. Norman Matheny. staff photographer President Ford : he debunks imperial presidency From page 1 *Ford gives views in last interview as President In conversations that ranged over a number of topics , the President said : ? That President-Elect Carter was off to a good start ? " basically I think he has gone about it right . I think he certainly has worked at it . I think the process and the effort has been a good one . I might have done something differently . But we each have a separate style . " ? That Mr. Carter would find it different running the national government than running state government in Georgia and that the new President might have to limit his intended involvement in managing the government here : " There are just so many hours in the day , " Mr. Ford said . ? That he feels " President Carter has some excellent opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add he has got a narrow range of decisionmaking . " To the reporter 's question , " Why is that ? " Mr. Ford added : " Well , because of the nature of the problems . Take the Middle East , trying to get Arabs and Israelis to agree , there is n't much flexibility . If it fails , it is a real tragedy . If it is successful , it will be a great kudo . But the range of options is relatively narrow . " Q : " Is the same thing true with South Africa ? A : " Southern Africa , exactly the same thing . " Q : " How about SALT strategic arms limitation talks ? " A : " That is the third . The opportunities for . great success are there , On the other hand , the dangers ? the pitfalls ? are also very real . " Q : " Also the economy ? " A : " Absolutely . " Q : " Are n't you saying in citing these alternatives that here is a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with disaster ? " A : " I would n't put it in those extremes . But the potentials for real success or unfortunate failure do exist . " This dialogue followed a question about whether President Carter might end up a one-term President . On his closeness to an arms agreement and the problems of negotiating during the campaign Mr. Ford said : " I would say we were 90 percent toward an agreement . There are , on the other hand , several sticky issues . The only way to resolve those is to sit down and negotiate , not in a hurry , not under pressure as to time or any other problems . And when you are engaged in a vigorous campaign which demands a sizable share of your time , there just has to be a hiatus there . " He added : " The time constraints during the campaign undoubtedly made it more difficult for us , and in return then , to continue in a normal-way in the negotiating process . " Of his feeling that the anxieties of the business community over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic lull , Mr. Ford said : " Some of the campaign promises by my opponent and the Democratic platform , if followed to the letter , I think would have upset the business community . I think they had a probable impact on some of the things they have done , which is understandable . " The charges that were made that involved the state of the economy were somewhat exaggerated . I think that might have had an impact on the public itself as to their buying habits , their conduct during that two- or three-month period . " Of the " temptations " that draw a president toward the " imperial presidency " the questioning went like this : Q : Is it the flattery around here , or is it the power ? " The President : " I think it depends upon your staff . My staff has never been too flattering . ( Here a loud presidential guffaw with his press secretary and press photographer joining in . ) Mr. Ford , continuing : " But I am glad they were n't because , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talk among the staff people . I think there can be the possibility of a staff building up . the president . Do n't you think so , Ron ? " ( press secretary Ron Nessen ) . Nessen : " Yes , sir . " The President : " Human nature being what it is , the president could pretty soon start to believe it . When that happens , I think you see , you are bound , to see the imperial presidency just come back in all its , I think , evils . " Q : " A wife can help out a lot there , too . ca n't she ? " President : " A wife can be very helpful in preventing it . I have had some help . - ( He laughs ) . But that is very good . " ( a pause ) " But if you have got a combination of a president and his ' wife who were flattered and believed it , boy , you would really have trouble . " On a variety of topics Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " stimulated the economy , would he have won the election , " he said : " It is a possibility . " ? Asked if he " had any final advice for the nation , " he said : " We have an absolute requirement to maintain the kind of a military capability to meet any challenge , all reasonable contingencies . because that is the best insurance for peace . " We ca n't do it on a peak-and-valley basis . You ca n't do it by oscillating from strength to weakness . You have to have a consistent , firm program where you invest today for the strength of tomorrow . " Therefore , I would strongly urge the American people to support . on the one hand , and insist on the other , that such a program be in being as it is today and for the future " ? Asked if he thought a " better moral tone " now was present in Washington . the President said : " Certainly at the present we have . I see no reason why it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level of code of conduct , I think they will insist on it . Anybody who deviates , I think , is going to pay a penalty . " Q : " What must the Congress do now to improve the moral tone there ? " A : " It has got to carry out the recommendations of the Peterson report ? emphasizing disclosure , restricting outside income , doing away with some of the , I think , unjustifiable ' perks , ' so to speak . " If they would carry out the recommendations of the Peterson report , they will meet the standards that the President insists on in the executive branch and in the judicial branch of government . " ? The question about whether the President would run again for the office in 1980 brought about some joshing and fun between Mr. Ford and the interviewer . It went like this : Q : " In previous interviews , you obviously left the door open co possibly running again . I am wondering whether your competitive instincts have bene aroused and whether you really would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President : " I have n't thought through that far . Q : " Do you think you are entitled to another chance , if you decide to ? as close as you came ? " A : " I do n't think anybody is entitled to it . I think you have to earn the nomination and earn the election , but it is very premature . " Q : " It is n't for me , Mr. President . " ( Loud laughter from all present , Mr. Ford leading the way ) . A : " I am not , going beyond " maybe . " Q : " I was going to try to go a little further than ' Maybe . ' " A : " I thought that went just about the right distance . " Q : " You like the word ' maybe . ' Well , there you are . " ? Asked if he thought a " Ford-Rockefeller ticket would have been a winning one , " the President said that this was " speculation " and added : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question about that . " ? Asked how ! mitt , : y would rate Richard Nixon as a president , lie said : " I have no idea how history or historians will judge him . I have said publicly and I think it is a fact , in the area of foreign policy he did a good job for the United States . I think history may have mixed views as to his domestic policies . " Q : " You knew him very well . Do you view him as a tragic figure or as an evil figure ? A : " I think it is a very tragic situation . " Q : " What was the basic flaw in that man 's character ? " A : " I do n't think I should discuss that . " Q : " His character was flawed then ? " A : " I do n't want to say that publicly . YOu tried hard . "                    @
