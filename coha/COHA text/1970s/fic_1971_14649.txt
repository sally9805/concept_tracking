PERRY 'S room . A gloomy place , decorated only with one poster of James Dean . Two doors , one leading to the hallway , the other to FRANK , his friend 's , room . One window looks out on a block of apartments just across the street . PERRY sits in a chair with a guitar in his lap . A guitar manual lies open on his bed . He 's craning to see the chord diagram . PERRY Second finger . Third . Fourth  --  dja , that 's a bitch  --  ( He strums a nice chord . ) Fantastic . E major . Frank , hey , Frank , c'mere a minute . Frank . Listen to this . Hey , Frank , hurry up , I ca n't keep it . ( FRANK appears slowly in his doorway . ) Get this E major . ( Strums . He 's lost it . ) Shit . I had this great E major . FRANK Yeah . PERRY It 's this chord , see . E major . Couple more of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PERRY I got this whole bit worked out with a blues and everything . Get me a calfskin vest , turquoise buttons . You know , the whole folk thing . It could be a very cool routine if I work it up . FRANK Yeah . PERRY What do you think , Frank ? Will that do it ? ( FRANK goes back into his room . PERRY follows him and stands in the doorway , looking in . ) It 's ' cause how you said . The rugged approach . I figure with this calfskin vest and everything . I seen a lot of really boss chicks around folk singers . A lot of blonde ones with them Greek bags . Maybe I could do me a Greek routine . What do you think , Frank ? Hey , I like your curtains , Frank . I did n't know you got yourself new curtains . I like them . Where you going ? ( FRANK brushes by him. ) p. 3 FRANK Out . PERRY Where ? Where you going ? FRANK This appointment . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there . PERRY Who ? FRANK Keep cool , kid . PERRY You gon na  --  you know , on the way ? FRANK If I feel like it . PERRY What 'll it be , huh ? Blonde ? Big boobs and everything ? FRANK Maybe . Then again , maybe not . PERRY ( Pause . ) Frank what do you say to them ? I mean , there 's this chick on the street , and you come up , right ? Now , what 's the big opener ? ( Pause . ) How do you do it , Frank ? FRANK Just play it cool , kid . No sweat . ( FRANK starts out the door . ) You know how it is . ( FRANK is gone . ) PERRY ( Pause . ) No . Hey , Frank . ( At door . ) If you find one with a friend , could you  --  ( Grinds to halt. )  --  just for the hell of it ? ( PERRY picks up the guitar and begins a bow-legged walk . ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where I 'm from and I do n't know where I 'm going . I just know where I 'm at . Stop crying , baby , I ai n't worth it . ( He confronts the James Dean poster . ) Hey , man , it 's just you , Frank and me , right ? ( Goes back to the guitar manual . ) Shit . I ca n't even do an E major yet . ( A knock on the door . PERRY puts down his guitar and opens the door . DEKE is standing there with his bag. ) p. 4 DEKE You Frank ? PERRY No . DEKE I had this feeling you were n't . PERRY Frank 's gone . DEKE Gone ? He 's gone away ? PERRY You know , out . Out for the day . DEKE I know what you mean . PERRY He goes out during the day . Comes back at night . That 's the way he is . DEKE If he 's with a girl or anything you just tell me , ' cause I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his or something ? DEKE Yeah , that 's how it is . Me and Frank . This his room ? PERRY I 'm in here . He 's in there . DEKE I 'll just come in , OK ? ( He does . ) I guess he 's got ta come through here when he wants to go out , huh ? PERRY It 's just the way the place is laid out . DEKE Pretty weird layout . PERRY Some architects . I guess they never figured you 'd get two guys , you know , sharing the place and everything . Not with this particular set-up . p. 5 DEKE No , a lotta architects are like that . I got nothin ' against them . A lotta architects are OK in my book . Frank 's got the better deal , if you ask me . I mean , you got ta put up with him coming through here all the time . PERRY Oh , I do n't know . I have to go through his room to get to the bathroom and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . DEKE I 'll tell you what I think of this set-up . I do n't think it 's a very good set-up for two guys with different temperaments and backgrounds and interests which I 'm just guessing at but I bet I 'm right . Frank did n't tell me about the layout . I got this idea in my head about this place and I 'm finding I was very mistaken . Frankly , I 'm pissed off . I 'm just telling you in case you notice I 'm walking around here pissed off in the next few days on account of how the way the place is laid out . I want to make it clear , else you might get the wrong idea and think I 'm pissed off at you or something . I got nothing against you . In fact , I 'm very touched by the way you and Frank just invited me to stay like this without paying rent or anything . PERRY Frank did n't say anything about that . DEKE That 's funny . Frank 's a pretty responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . We 'll have to take it up with him . p. 6 PERRY He usually tells me things . DEKE Look , if you figure I 'll be in the way , just say so and I 'll go walking round for a few more days until I find a place . I respect privacy , that 's one thing about me . PERRY It 's OK with me . DEKE I mean , it 's just from looking around I get the idea you 're probably cultivating yourself and developing a lot of interests and maybe you got pretty big plans for the future , so if you think I might be messing up your life or anything , you just say so and we 'll avoid a lot of hard feelings all round . PERRY No , I do n't mind . DEKE You do n't have to lie to me , ' cause I 'm not that kind of person . PERRY Honest , I 'd love to have you . Me and Frank would love to have you as a house guest . DEKE A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favour , but when it comes to the acid test , you know what I mean , the showdown  --  A lotta guys are like that . I 'll sleep over there . PERRY Well , I mean , you 're sort of Frank 's friend . DEKE Look , if there 's something about me rubs you up wrong , you just say so and do n't crap around . p. 7 PERRY What do you mean ? I think you 're a good guy . DEKE You said how I was Frank 's friend like the two of us did n't even know each other . PERRY I just mean  --  well , we got the beginnings of an acquaintance all right , no question about that . But I figure you 're Frank 's friend first and foremost . ( Pause . ) And my friend second . DEKE I know what you mean . I 'll stay in there . PERRY You know , you 'd have more to talk about . Like , if you went to school together you could talk about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football and that . DEKE I never went to school with Frank . PERRY All right , stay in here if you feel like it . I do n't mind . DEKE It 's just , if he gets laid a lot he might not want me in there . PERRY That 's a good point . DEKE He get 's laid a lot , huh ? PERRY You better believe it . Every night , just about . Hey , how 'd you know . I mean , what if I get laid a lot ? DEKE You 're right about Frank and me . We probably got a lot to talk about . I 'll stay in there . p. 8 PERRY Hey , can you tell I do n't get laid ? Does it show ? DEKE Look , I got a favour to ask . This might sound a little weird , but if you have to go to the toilet at night , do n't flush , OK ? I 'll flush in the morning . PERRY Sure . I respect that . DEKE And put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look or anything . PERRY You a light sleeper ? DEKE It 's funny you should ask , ' cause one thing about me is I sleep very deep , and there was this doctor , he said I came very close to death whenever I whip off to sleep . ( Pause . ) Hey , why 'd you ask that ? PERRY I just wondered about the flushing , that 's all . DEKE What about it ? PERRY Nothing , I just wondered . DEKE ( Yelling . ) Like hell you did . You 're the most suspicious bastard I ever met . PERRY Hey , take it easy . I was just asking . DEKE Sticking your fucking probes in . Prodding around . Poking . Like those stupid-ass doctors with that thing they stick in your ear with a light . Digging around for dirty wax . Infection . I 'll tell you what . It just so happens I got no reason for not wanting you to flush the toilet so you can sit there all night for all I care . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull away like crazy . ( Very calm . ) On the other hand , I do n't like the sound of flushing in the night . There 's no reason for that either , but I thought I 'd let you know , ' cause you might just sneak in there one night and give a quick flush and that would definitely disturb me . I get pretty angry then , but I 'm OK now . p. 9 PERRY I do n't mind . DEKE I feel a lot better now . Yep . Great . I had all that on my mind just building up like mad and bango out it came . I do n't think we 'll have another of those little outbursts for quite a while . I guess I 'll check out Frank 's room . PERRY I 'll be in here . DEKE Why did you go and tell me that ? PERRY Just in case you want anything . DEKE I know what you mean . What happens when Frank gets laid ? PERRY What do you mean ? DEKE Brings them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out . It 's this code , where he knocks a certain way and I know he 's got himself a broad . I just turn my back that 's all . He comes right through . It 's like I 'm not even here . Same thing in the morning . I respect the guy 's privacy . That 's how I am . DEKE What do you mean by that ? PERRY I respect it , that 's all . That 's how I 'm made . It 's part of my personality . DEKE Yeah . I know what you mean . ( DEKE exits into FRANK 'S room with his bag . The lights fade . When they come up , the stage is empty . FRANK comes rushing out of his room holding DEKE 'S bag. ) p. 10 FRANK HEY ! What 's this doing in my room ? Somebody messed up my room ? Who put my new interspring mattress on the floor ? ( Returns to his room . Comes out again . ) Oh , boy , somebody 's really trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddam place is upside down in there . You 'll pay for this . Hey , Perry ! ( Returns to his room . Enters again . ) Shit . They 've really done a job in there . Someone 's behind this . I know you 're in here somewhere . Hey , come out . Hey , help . ( DEKE enters through the front door . ) Hey , just take a look in there . I just came in , just now . I just went into my room . Look what they did in there . ( Pause . ) Hey , who are you ? ( DEKE goes into FRANK 'S room . Returns a moment later . ) DEKE I do n't know , Frank . A few things moved around . Otherwise it 's about like it was before . You had me going for a second . I thought we 'd been robbed . FRANK You know Perry , or something ? DEKE We decided I 'd stay in there . Perry said we 'd have a lot to talk about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for stereo or anything like that ? FRANK You a boyhood friend of his ? DEKE Who ? p. 11 FRANK Perry . The other guy here . DEKE No . FRANK How do you know him ? DEKE You and Perry share this thing of being very suspicious bastards . Always wanting to know all about a guy before he 's said hello or anything . FRANK Perry and me , we 're fifty-fifty in here , and I got a right to know . That 's all . Do n't get me wrong . DEKE The thing is , I did n't notice a stereo in your room . I was a stereo nut in my day . We could 've talked about stereo . I had a friend , you could sit in this place in his living-room and he 'd put on a symphony or a woodwind quintet . If you closed your eyes , I swear it was like they were in the same room as you . You do n't go in for stereo , huh ? FRANK I dabble a little . Woofers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really gone on it , though . FRANK I can take it or leave it . DEKE OK . I 'll buy that . FRANK Hey , you know my room in there . You really fucked it up . DEKE I 'll tell you the truth , Frank . I went in there and I was n't altogether pleased with the way you got your room laid out . Perry and me , we had to make this difficult decision about where I 'd stay . The big hang-up was how you were n't here at the time . p. 12 FRANK I was out on business . DEKE I know what you mean . I 'm not gon na mess around . Frank . I 'm gon na tell you right out I think I 'd 've been better off in here , and that 's not to say I got anything against you , which I definitely have n't . In fact , I think you got a very attractive manner about you , and I do n't want you to go thinking I 'm queer ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind I got . DEKE It 's just that I got all fixed up in there . I got it just how I like it and judging from how you was shitting bricks just now when I came in , you probably got all the initial surprise and anger out of your system by now . I could move in here , of course , but then Perry 'd have to go shit a brick to get it out of his system , and that 's a pretty thoughtless way of going about things , if you see what I mean . ( Pause . ) You play Monopoly ? FRANK Monopoly ? DEKE Yeah , I mean , we got nothin ' to talk about , so maybe we could play games and that . FRANK Monopoly 's a kid 's game . DEKE Oh , I do n't know . FRANK Little kids play it . It gets rid of power fantasies . p. 13 DEKE Brother , you got a wicked grasp of human nature , do n't you . FRANK That 's just basic stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dropped out of school way back . I missed all the basics . One thing I ca n't figure out is how guys like you , I mean , you get all this education , and here I am just about nearly illiterate , but when it comes to getting laid , I 'm scoring all the time , day in , day out , and look at you . FRANK Listen , buddy-oh , buddy-boy . I get laid plenty . I snap my fingers and there 's ass crawling all over it . Ask anyone . Just say What about old Frank ? Just say that and you 'll see . They 'll tell you . DEKE The way I figure it , education does a lotta good for most broads . I mean , they got nothin ' to do but sit around and figure out all kinds of variations . It 's always the classy , educated broad that asks for the weirdy variations . That 's been my experience . FRANK Look , I do n't mind if you stay here , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room . I mean , it was just stuff , even though you moved it out of positions I 'd worked out pretty carefully over a long period of time . But there 's certain things a guy does n't like to hear said about himself , and one of those things is that he does n't get laid a lot . p. 14 DEKE I never said that . If you got the impression I said that , I 'm sorry and I take it all back . FRANK OK . Just so we know where we stand , that 's all . DEKE But I might as well say I got this distinct impression you 're a virgin . FRANK All right , now watch your ass . Just watch it . DEKE It 's just that I looked through your stuff ' cause I wanted to know what kind of guy I was sharing a room with . And I found a box of rubbers in there . A one dozen box , which I think is very optimistic . FRANK Do n't worry about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone through about a hundred of those boxes . You just look at my waste basket at the end of the week . Ask the garbage man . DEKE I got the impression you bought them rubbers about a year ago , and I noticed one was missing . What I figured was you just took it out when there was no one around , and tried it on in front of the mirror , just to see how it worked . FRANK Do n't fuck around with me . I 'm taking a lot from you , and I 'm holding back ' cause I know a little about psychology , but do n't push me . DEKE Sorry , Frank . I got this instinct is all . I just walk into a room and I can tell right off if a woman ever got it in any given room . It 's a question of manhood , and I respect you , Frank , even though you 're a virgin and you feel you got ta lie about it all the time . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figure you 'd be better off if you stopped all this shitting around about how much you 're getting . Do n't worry about me . I 'm not the sort of guy that 's gon na mouth it round to everyone . I do n't like guys that talk about other people 's hang-ups behind their backs , so you can trust me. p. 15 FRANK Wait 'll I get ahold of Perry . Friends are one thing . DEKE I know I 'm kind of in the way here , and I 'll do what I can to help out . I 'll do what I can to get you laid , Frank , ' cause I appreciate how much it must be bugging you . FRANK Do n't push . That 's all I 'm saying . Do n't push . ( FRANK , red in the face , dashes into his room . DEKE carefully takes in PERRY 'S room . He confronts the poster of James Dean . ) DEKE Stupid fucker . Thought you were all kinds of hot shit , did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got you , baby , they got you . ( FRANK re-enters . ) FRANK I 'll tell you one thing . You are n't having the red blanket . DEKE OK . ( FRANK exits nito his room . Fade out . Lights up on FRANK and PERRY . PERRY sits . FRANK is pacing . ) FRANK You 're a real shit , letting him in like that . PERRY He said how he knew you and everything . FRANK Look , would I invite a guy in here just like that without telling you first ? Is that how I am ? p. 16 PERRY You 're not like that , Frank . FRANK You better believe it . ( Pause . ) There 's something about that guy . See what he did in there ? Fucked up everything . PERRY I 'll help you change it back . We 'll put him in here . FRANK There 's something up , all right . I mean , there 's all these hundreds of people around . Thousands all over the place and he picked us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how do you explain that ? PERRY I do n't know , Frank . Honest . FRANK That 's what I mean . There 's something up . PERRY ( Tentatively . ) Hey , Frank . You know , when you get the broads coming in  --  well , I do n't mind if you stay in here . I 'll keep the old back turned . I wo n't peek . FRANK Look , you do n't worry about old Frank . PERRY I 'll stay in there with him if you want . FRANK When I want a broad , I take her anywhere I feel like it , you know what I mean . Yankee Stadium if I feel like it . PERRY Some , guys . I never even got me an outside feel yet . p. 17 FRANK That bastard 's not staying in my room , that 's all there is to it . PERRY OK . In here , then . I do n't mind . FRANK No . PERRY OK . FRANK Stop fucking agreeing with me all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I am . ( Pause . ) We 'll call the cops . FRANK You crazy or something ? We call the cops , they 'll come in here  --  they 'll come in  --  they 'll mess everything up . Break chairs and that . Rip up the curtains . Work you over . PERRY Why will they do that ? FRANK Look , I know about cops . That 's what they do . You do n't go calling cops . I 'll handle this . PERRY OK . If you say so . FRANK You better believe it . PERRY ( Pause . ) What are you gon na do ? FRANK What 's this thing you got about me making all the big decision , anyway ? This place is both of us , OK ? We get equal say . PERRY Sure . But I 'm with you all the way . Whatever you decide , it 's OK with me. p. 18 FRANK Listen to what I 'm telling you . We got ta vote on if he stays or not . PERRY Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . FRANK ( Mad . ) No one says old Frank runs this place like a fucking dictatorship . We vote equal . You got ta vote against me . ( Calm . ) I 'm getting all worked up . It 's the principle I 'm talking about . You are entitled to vote against me . That 's how we work things around here . PERRY I 'm just thinking . He 's already sort of moved in , so he probably has a vote coming . He 'll probably vote to stay , so if we want him to go , we 'll both have to vote against . That way he ca n't cast the deciding ballot . FRANK The thing about you , is you 're a worm , boy . You have a wormy mentality . You got this way of making everyone want to step on you . Squish . Like a worm . PERRY What 'd I do now ? FRANK We got this very simple decision , and you go making it into a regular conundrum . Just like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive ) . I say he goes . FRANK ( Pause . ) How come you 're so anxious to get rid of him all of a sudden ? p. 19 PERRY It 's just how I 'm voting , is all . FRANK Fucking crawly worm . PERRY OK . So he stays . FRANK You better believe it . PERRY In here ? FRANK In there . And I 'm staying right in there with him . He 's not gon na try any funny business while I 'm around . PERRY What about all the broads ? FRANK Do n't worry about old Frank . ( Front door opens . DEKE enters with NANCY . NANCY is n't a wow , but then again . ) DEKE Hello , Frank . Hello , Perry . I want you to meet Nancy . ( Pause . ) She 's a good kid . NANCY I cook and things . PERRY ( Rising . Formal . ) I 'm pleased to make your acquaintance . ( Pause . ) I hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us . DEKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be staying in his room . NANCY You wo n't know I 'm here just about . I ca n't tell you how overcome I was when Tiger , I 'm sorry , Deke here told me he 'd found two such generous individuals . I guess we 'll all get to know each other pretty well . Deke tells me you have an extensive education , Frank . p. 20 FRANK Yeah . NANCY That 's a big relief . With Tiger  --  I 'm sorry again , with Deke it 's mostly body , if you know what I mean , not that I underestimate the physical side , but a meaningful relationship ca n't thrive , I mean really thrive , without intellectual stimulation . I 'm behind Erich Fromm on that one . I 'm sorry I 'm chattering away like this but I get awful nervous in unstructured situations . PERRY You do n't have to feel nervous with us . Nancy . We 're pleased to have you with us . NANCY I feel much better now you 've said that . DEKE Perry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the action . NANCY I come from a poor background myself . Italian-Polish , which is a pretty kooky mixture , I know , but among my family there was this  --  this feeling of community , if you know what I mean . When I heard about the two of you I thought to myself , cripes , it 'll be just like home again . All this togetherness , I really miss the family bit , ' cause we 've sort of drifted apart on account of my education . It 's ironic how they sweated , and I mean they really did . Sweat , I mean , to put me through school . I did too . I mean , five nights a week at Ho-Jos waiting on tables is no joke . I 'm just filling you in . You two guys , I mean , you know all about each other already and a little about Tiger  --  I 'm sorry , I 'll have to break that habit  --  Deke . And , well , I 'm a total stranger , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sarcasm , he is never sarcastic . ) I think we know you a lot better now , Nancy . NANCY Well , just the externals . I 'm not always this nervous . I hope you get to know the real me . You must think I 'm pretty inefficient because of being in college . PERRY I would n't say that . NANCY I make this fantastic spaghetti with a little salt and butter and mint . It 's a recipe we 've kicked around in the family for maybe centuries , I do n't know . DEKE You could go and make some of that , Nancy . NANCY Boy , it 's such a relief to know I 'll be useful . How do I get to the kitchen ? DEKE You got ta go through Frank 's bedroom . Then you got ta go through the bathroom . NANCY Wow , I heard of weird set-ups before . PERRY It 's just the way the place is laid out . NANCY That 's the thing about architects . They do n't design with people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , Frank ? FRANK What ? NANCY Do you go along with Corbusier and Gropius on the question of living spaces ? p. 22 FRANK Well , you know how it is . NANCY I 'm not saying I 'm a hundred per cent with them . A lot of their stuff is already out of date . FRANK Yeah , that 's what I mean . A lot of it 's OK . I can take it or leave it . NANCY It 's really great how we got things to talk about , huh ? ( NANCY exits into FRANK 'S room . ) PERRY Brother , she knows a lot . DEKE Nancy 's got a very good head on her . PERRY That 's pretty good , huh , Frank . I mean , now you got someone to talk to about all those books and everything . FRANK Yeah . PERRY Hey , how 'd you meet her , Deke ? DEKE She was standing around . You know . PERRY You mean , you just went right up to her and said hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? DEKE Yeah . ' Hello , I 'm Deke . ' FRANK Brother , what an opener . Some subtlety . PERRY Is that how you do it , Frank ? p. 23 DEKE Look , there 's this education gap between Frank and me . FRANK Everyone 's got a personal style of their own , that 's all . You do n't want to go harping on this education thing too much . DEKE I know what you mean . As long as we both keep hauling them in , right ? FRANK You better believe it . ( NANCY comes back in . ) NANCY Excuse me for interrupting , but I have something important to say . It 's got mainly to do with you , Frank , seeing as how we 'll all be in there together . It 's just  --  well you see how nervous I am and everything . It kind of all comes out when I 'm with a guy . What I mean is , when I 'm in the sack , I really let go and it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reich on that question . Are you with Reich , Frank ? FRANK Well , you know how it is . I think he 's got a lot to say . NANCY I 'm glad you understand , ' cause I really believe in letting go . It gets rid of all that tension . I mean , as a woman , well , it 's like de Beauvoir said , our position in society is basically ambivalent and I agree . So I tend to scream like hell . Sorry if I interrupted . ( NANCY exits . ) FRANK ( Pause . ) Look , maybe I better sleep in here . p. 24 DEKE That 's OK , Frank . We do n't mind if you stay in there with us . FRANK No , I respect a guy 's privacy . DEKE All we 'll be doing is sleeping and joking around and screwing quite a bit . I mean , if we want to do something private  --  if we want to talk over something personal or anything we 'll tell you and you can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life to live , you know . DEKE You can bring your own girl back there if you want . We could all be in there together and swap around when we get bored or do a three way deal . FRANK ( Steadily angrier ) . Old Frank does n't go messing with someone else 's broad . DEKE I do n't own her , you know . I 'll tell you what . You stay in your room with Nancy , and I 'll get a couple of girls for Perry and me . PERRY Could you really do that , Deke ? FRANK She 's your broad and she 's staying in there with you . I do n't go for this messing around . DEKE OK . I just thought I might help you zip right through that new pack of rubbers  --  FRANK Do n't fuck around with me , Deke. p. 25 DEKE OK . PERRY Hey , Deke , what 's that three way thing you said ? DEKE If you 'd like to join us , Perry , you 're welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in here . I 'll take care of the three way deals . DEKE OK . ( DEKE exits into FRANK 'S room . ) FRANK Look , you do n't go messing around like that with a stranger . If you want to get anywhere , there 's a hard and fast rule . Stick to your own broad . PERRY All right , Frank . ( Pause . ) Hey , how do you do it with three people ? Does everyone do it at once or what ? ( Lights fade . When it comes up again , FRANK and PERRY have their ears to the door of FRANK 'S room . Sex noises from within . ) What 's that , Frank ? What 's he doing now ? FRANK Just warming up . Preliminary love play . PERRY You mean kissing and that ? FRANK The whole business . Words of endearment . Gentle exchange of exploratory touches to overcome initial shyness . PERRY You can tell that from the noise ? p. 26 FRANK You get so you can tell . PERRY What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A loud moan . ) What 's that ? FRANK He 's doing harash al akim . PERRY What 's that ? FRANK Breath of the lion . It 's an Arab thing . Works wonders , the old harash . He knows his stuff , that guy . PERRY It all sounds the same to me . ( Another moan within . ) What 's he doing now ? FRANK Boy , he 's really got her going , all right . Whipping her right up into a state of maximum receptivity . PERRY How do you do that ? FRANK Listen , will you ? She 's expressing willingness now . She 's indicating that she 's ready for entry . PERRY How does she do that ? What does she say ? FRANK You can always tell . No sweat . PERRY Is that the noise they make ? FRANK It varies . Some do , some do n't . It 's a question of temperaments and the relative size of the organs involved . PERRY All that from just the noise . p. 27 FRANK It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How come you never  --  I mean , when you get the broads in there  --  I never hear anything . FRANK It 's a question of technique , right ? He goes for the noisy , head on stuff . I like the quite approach . There 's more style to it , you know what I mean . PERRY No . ( Moan within . ) What 's happening now ? FRANK ( Abstract . ) I could have them screaming like that . Any day . Ask anyone . I could get them  --  it 's just I like the quiet approach . PERRY It sounds like he 's killing her . FRANK ( Recovering . ) What ? Oh , there 's your entry , all right . Fast worker , old Deke . He 's inserting his member into her vagina now . That 's it , all right . I 'll bet you anything they 've effected full union now . PERRY Brother , what I would n't give to be in his place  --  FRANK There it is . She 's starting to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be much better than average , if you ask me . I would n't be surprised if he was trying out rekead el air , the old race of the member . p. 28 PERRY What 's that ? FRANK It 's just a thing you do . Arab . PERRY I guess they 'll be exchanging endearments like crazy now . FRANK You better believe it . PERRY Not even a dry feel . I 'm a sexual mess . FRANK ( Sports announcer . ) Listen to that . She 's reaching the crest of her enjoyment . He 's holding back his ejaculation to ensure that they share their bliss simultaneously thereby enhancing the feeling of mutual well-being . PERRY What ? FRANK There you go . She 's signalling the arrival of her peak . It 's gon na be a good one . He 's ready to let go . Hot diggity , he knows what he 's doing . Here it comes . Perfect timing , man , listen to that  --  ( A shattering burst of screams , moans , etc . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to see if they 're all right . I mean , it sounded like someone might have got hurt . FRANK Listen to that . ( Low panting . ) That 's your afterglow . Very important to fulsome and successful union . He knows his stuff . p. 29 PERRY Hey , do you think  --  you know , how does he compare with you ? FRANK He 's OK . You know , nothing special . ( They both go to bed . FRANK in PERRY 'S bed , PERRY on the floor . ) PERRY ( Pause . ) Frank . ( Silence . ) Hey , Frank ? Frank , you awake ? FRANK Yeah . PERRY How 'd you score the first time ? FRANK The first one 's the real bitch . After that it 's clear sailing . PERRY Couple of kisses is all I ever got . Not even with the tongue . Hey , Frank , what do you think of my guitar thing ? I saw this vest in town . Very sharp item . Hey , Frank , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERRY ( Pause . ) I 'm sorry about letting him in ( Pause . ) Good night . ( As they settle down , the noises begin again from within . PERRY and FRANK tense and crane up as the lights dim . ) ( The lights come up on PERRY , sitting on his bed . FRANK charges in from his room holding his sheets in a wad. ) p. 30 FRANK Look at it . Come all over the sheets . Come in the mattress , soaked right in . Right through the plastolyn springs and out the other side . Fifty bucks worth of interspring with that animal 's come in it . ( Throws down the sheets , takes out his box of safes and counts. )  --  four , five . Five left out of ele-twelve . Five out of twelve . Six  --  seven times in one night . Tell me if that 's human ? Boy , what a horny little two bit piece she must be . Do n't think old Frank did n't spot that cherry-red-pucker-lip- **25;3342;TOOLONG look on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're a couple of prize fucking idiots . PERRY I thought she cooked a very nice breakfast of eggs and toast and waffles and fresh orange juice and maple syrup . FRANK They 've had it with us . As of now those two are out on their ass . Get some paper . We 're writing a note . PERRY What kind of note ? FRANK Do n't start worming around on me . Get some paper . ( He does . ) Fucking up my room like that with a two-bit whore . Anyone could 've cooked that breakfast . Anyone . PERRY What should I put ? FRANK You just put how he 'd better get his filthy hard up ass out of here . From us . Yeah , sign it , from the two guys who pay rent . That 'll put him right in his place . Right down there where he belongs . p. 31 PERRY All right , I got all that . Where do we leave it ? FRANK In his bed . My bed . My fucking bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PERRY goes into FRANK 'S room . ) Some people . ( To James Dean . ) Yeah , it 's shits like you started it all . Oh , yeah , I got your number . ( PERRY re-enters . ) PERRY It 's too bad about Nancy . She 's had a rough time . ( A knock on the front door . ) FRANK Well , go on . Open it . PERRY It 's just , I do n't want him to think  --  see , I do n't mind if he stays . FRANK Open the fucking door . ( PERRY opens the door . The AGENT stands there smiling . ) AGENT Hi , Deke . PERRY Who 's Deke ? I 'm not Deke . I 'm Perry . AGENT My mistake , Perry . I mistook you for Deke . It was a long shot , you know what I mean . Did n't pay off , that 's all . ( The AGENT pushes into the room and confronts FRANK . ) Hi , Deke . FRANK I 'm Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did the whole youth bit . Larking around , goofing off , wild oats . I know the score . Watch out , that 's my message . I 'm on official business . PERRY Sorry , sir . We respect you quite a lot already , but we are n't Deke . AGENT I like your face , kid . It 's got truth written all over it and that 's a thing I like to see on the youth of today . I get a lot of wise guy punks in my line , and a couple of decent kids like you is a real pleasure . Give it to me straight , kids . We knew he 's here with a female companion . FRANK Are you from the cops ? AGENT I 'm just this guy . It 's funny . I got a wife , a couple a kids , a lot of stuff in the house , television , twenty-one inch screen , you know . Got a nice car . Chevy , but nice , sea-blue . See what I mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out , that 's the question they ask . You from the cops ? I 'm gon na be unofficial for a minute , OK ? I just want to ask , in an unofficial capacity , what is it about me , huh ? Why do I give off this impression of a cop ? Can I ask you that ? FRANK No , that 's OK . AGENT ( Pause ) . So , I asked . FRANK We got ta answer ? p. 33 AGENT You 'd take a lot off my mind . It 's up to you . You got a choice . Tell me , will you ? FRANK The thing is , I do n't know you very well , so you might think this is an insult , which it is n't . I just have this very direct way of speaking . AGENT No , go on . Right from the shoulder . Man to man . FRANK It 's how you came charging in here like you owned the place , assuming all kinds of things about who we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you breathe heavy like a guy with a heart condition . And you have a kind of surly manner about you that disgusts me . I associate those things with cops . AGENT Wow . That 's a lot of faults all right . There 's no getting around that . I got a lot to improve . You got a knack for putting your finger right on it . I want to thank you , Frank , ' cause now I 'll be able to work on those faullts and come out a better person . FRANK I 'm glad you took it the right way , sir . AGENT Where 's Deke ? FRANK See , there you go again  --  AGENT Shut up , kid . I 'm being official again and I do n't want a lot of bullshit and smart-alecky lip . He 's staying here , right ? p. 34 PERRY We could leave a message you called . AGENT Do n't foul up on me , kid . I got a favourable impression of you so do n't louse up your image in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGENT See these two fists . Dynamite , kids . Two thousand tons of TNT in each one . One more piece of lip and I let go . Have we got all that straightened out now ? PERRY Maybe if you told us who you are it would help things out all around . AGENT OK . Fair 's fair . I 'm from Central Agency . FRANK ( Very impressed . ) You 're with that outfit , huh ? AGENT You got it . Now , where is he ? FRANK We 're kicking him out . PERRY He was here , you see . You got that right . But we had this conflict of personal habits . FRANK He was a fucking animal , to be exact . AGENT I know all about this Deke . We got stuff on him right back to the age of two , every detail , intimate and otherwise with a special emphasis on mental balance , and if you two guys gave me your full name and social security number , I could walk out of here down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope on both of you back to the age of two . That 's how we work at Central . We got guys coming up with ways of getting information right back to the day of birth . And I 'll tell you something else which is n't known among the general public at large . There 's guys over in genetics working out this system so we 'll know what kind of kids 'll come out of any given combination of parents , and how they 'll develop until we need them . p. 35 FRANK Hey , that 's some outfit , huh ? AGENT The best , kid . We 're a hundred per cent at CA . FRANK And you 're right in on that , huh ? AGENT I do OK . I 'm not complaining , you know what I mean . ( Tenses . ) It 's the old stall routine . It wo n't wash , kids , let 's have it . PERRY The thing is , we 've kind of lost track of Deke for the moment . AGENT ( Punches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blow my top . PERRY ( Half groan , half yell . ) We do n't know where the hell Deke is and will you leave us alone , please ? FRANK Let 's cut the shit . He 's doing his job . AGENT Do n't let it get to you , kid . That was a routine punch . There were no personal connotations in that punch . I have a job to do , you understand what I mean . It 's a great life , kid . Opportunities opening all up around . The world 's an oyster , kid . There 's a lotta truth in the old clich . I look around me and I wish I was young again . FRANK We know how it is , sir . Do n't worry about that . AGENT Just tell Deke we 've ben around , that 's all . You tell him we got his number . Any time we feel like it , and WHAM , he 's ours . You tell him . p. 36 FRANK You bet your ass we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got . ( To James Dean poster . ) That face is familiar . I 'll bet you got ta go through the bathroom to get to the kitchen in this place . FRANK Brother , nothing gets by you , does it ? AGENT I was young once , you know . Take it easy , you guys . ( The AGENT exits through the front door . PERRY still nurses his stomach . ) FRANK That guy knows his business , all right . He 's a pro . See how he pulled it off . In here five minutes and he got the message right across , no messing around . PERRY I hope they do n't have stuff about me at that place . FRANK You kidding ? They got it all laid out down there at old Central . Fantastic bunch , down there . PERRY I just hope they do n't know about me . FRANK Know what ? You got something to hide ? PERRY I just do n't like the idea . That 's all . FRANK You 're holding out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , what 's it all about ? p. 37 PERRY Nothing . Honest , Frank , there 's nothing about me . It 's just I do n't like the idea of all these guys doing research into me . It 's a feeling you get . FRANK You 're going crazy . Come on , get on top of it . Look around you , man , things are getting better all the time . PERRY It 's just these things closing in on you from all around . You get this feeling you could end up pretty cracked and never know why . FRANK Not us . You and me , we 're right on top of it . Come on , kid , shape up . ( The front door opens . DEKE enters with NANCY . She carries a large shopping bag . ) NANCY I got cole slaw and potato salad and pickles and pumpernickel and radishes and cheese and salami and wine for lunch . I 'll fix it all up . We 'll have it like a picnic . ( NANCY goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to this park . They had rowboats , so I rowed Nancy out to an island . You would n't believe it . Not a guy in sight . It was really deserted as hell . Maybe it sounds kind of faggoty to say this , but to my way of thinking it was real beautiful out there and I wish I had your vocabulary and general powers of expression to tell you what a beautiful place it was . p. 38 PERRY What did you do ? DEKE We just messed around some , then came back . It cost all of a buck eighty , and worth every cent . In fact , I 'd do it again . FRANK ( Gloating slightly . ) Guess what , Dekie-boy . Guess what happened while you where gone . This guy came . DEKE ( Who knows . ) What 'd you tell him ? FRANK They know you 're here . No use , man , you 've had it . PERRY I 'm sorry , Deke . I did n't personally take to the guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Yelling . ) FUCK AND SHIT . PERRY What 's the matter , Deke ? DEKE ( Rage . ) Those lousy , cock-sucking bastards . ( To someone invisible and all around . ) Listen , you shits , I 'm still free . You have n't got me yet and I 'm giving you the slip again , you cunt-sucking pissheads . I 'm twenty-five , and I 'm good-looking and I got a build I can brag about and listen to this . Listen . You 're not touching me ' till I 've fucked two thousand women , and some of them are gon na be your wives and mothers , and daughters and aunts and sisters . I 'm gon na come all over you , I swear I am . I 'm gon na come until you 're up to the neck in it , swallowing it down in big globs , drowning in it . Hey , all you . That 's a promise . ( DEKE rushes out into FRANK 'S room. ) p. 39 PERRY He took that pretty hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it 's all about . ( DEKE re-enters holding his bag , calm now and very likeable . ) DEKE I found this note . You know what I think . think it said something nasty , ' cause from the moment I came in just before I could feel something shitty in the air . I got this instinct . ( He tears up the note . ) I 'll forget it ever happened , OK ? I 'm sorry I fucked up your room , Frank . No , what I mean is , I wish I could 've fucked it up more . I guess it 's too late for that . I kind of liked you two guys , even though Frank is a shit , and a very dangerous one . ( DEKE takes PERRY 'S guitar and smashes it to bits . ) You wo n't need that . I guess that 's about it , huh ? Oh , Frank , I left your Monopoly set by the bed . See you . ( DEKE exits . ) PERRY Brother , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that whole blues thing 's just about had it . I almost got old E major . ( NANCY enters with the food and some plates . ) NANCY I decided we 'd do it buffet style . ( Serves . ) I 'll do the dishing out . Saves trouble . ( Pause . ) Boy , me and Deke sure had a good time in the park . You 'd be knocked out to know how much privacy there is in a big city like this . p. 40 FRANK Mumford and Reismann have a lot to say on that question . NANCY Yeah . Books . They 're a drag . FRANK It 's a very good lunch you fixed . PERRY Nancy , would you mind telling me what you did on that island Deke was talking about ? NANCY Oh , man , it was really wild . Right in the middle of this island , I mean , trees and sand all over the place , and right in the middle there 's this bunch of grass . Old Tiger heads right for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and he heads right for it . The guy 's instinct is infallible . PERRY What happened ? NANCY He said , Lie down there , Nancy. PERRY Just like that ? And you did ? NANCY Yeah . I mean , he said to . PERRY That 's all there is to it ? FRANK I like this salami , Nancy . NANCY And then he said , Close your eyes , Nancy , and do n't think of anything . Clear your head out and breathe even. PERRY Do n't stop , Nancy . NANCY I shut my eyes and then , like , I could n't hear anything , see anything . Just this breathing , you know , in , out , in , out , and purring kind of things and I knew , I knew and I could feel it starting , deep inside , and starting , going down there and oh it tickled me so much , so much , do n't stop , oh Tiger please , oh do n't please do n't please rub me hard it itches Tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 PERRY What was he doing ? NANCY Water then and wet , oh I could feel it running , oozing out of me all warm and slimey wet I want I want and then he came into me , so large I could n't , could n't stop , oh Tiger , hurt me more and he was closer , closer , wet and hair and skin wet , body wet , and salty tasting kissing , sucking , pulling , sweating , screaming , more and more and then ( Breathing heavily. ) and then ( NANCY rocks , sways and heaves in ecstasy . ) PERRY Yeah ? What 's happening now ? NANCY ( She makes an ungodly sound of release . ) Then it burst ! and I felt this greeny-yellow-pussy goo rushing out of my body and I was clean inside . You know , really clean . ( Pause . ) Then it was quiet . I never felt like that before ever , not even after those six very better than average ones last night . Never came close before . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember how he did it , huh ? NANCY That was the vision . It did n't matter how . That 's what it 's all about . It just does n't matter how and with whom , so long as you do it all the time , everywhere . I 'm devoting my life to it . I want to try it every way . I want to be hurt . I want to be abused , whipped , stoned , cut , I want crude objects rammed in all my holes , I want to fuck huge niggers and little kikes , and spicks and chinks and micks and dirty alcoholic bums in railway stations . I want to die with cock in me . I want to give orgasm to every creature called human . That will be my mission . p. 42 PERRY ( Exclaming . ) Holy mother of God ! NANCY ( Looking around . ) Where 's Deke ? PERRY He 's gone . NANCY For ever and ever ? ( PERRY nods . ) It 's beautiful , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me the way , then disappeared . He was my guru . Deke , wherever you are , you 've shown me the way . ( She falls back exhausted . ) Wow , am I every hungry . ( She starts to eat , then looks up . ) So , now there 's just the three of us , huh ? I guess I 'll go in there . ( She walks seductively into FRANK 'S room . ) FRANK ( As PERRY rises . ) Brother , there 's one for Central . I mean , I 've seen depravity before . I 've seen a lot of things in my life , but she goes right over the limit . ( FRANK is eating away while PERRY very purposefully takes off his clothes . ) I mean , I have a definite preference for the free-thinking types , but you have to draw the line . If you ask me , she 's lost all sense of proportion , and I 've seen some weirdy broads in my day . ( PERRY is now in just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees him slowly approaching the door to FRANK 'S room . ) Hey , what are you doing ? Are you crazy ? Hey , are n't you gon na eat some of this delicious lunch ? ( PERRY turns at the door . He is hugely erect. ) p. 43 PERRY Wish me luck , Frank . ( PERRY exits , leaving FRANK gaping at the doorway while the lights dim. )                                                                                                                       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
