txt ON DAYS WHEN there is a strong north wind , the bronze statue of Judge Elbert Gary is almost obscured by the choking , corroding pollution from his own steel mill . That steel mill may be the only thing in Gary still recognizable to the judge who gave the Indiana town its name . The city has changed a lot since the early 1900s when Judge Gary , as head of United States Steel Corp. , built his mills and the camp town around them . When he died in 1927 , the city had already grown from a camp town to a brawling , sprawling city of nearly 100 , - 009 persons known primarily for its steel and vice . Gary was a bustling mill town packed with sturdy immigrants  --  Poles , Czechs , Yugoslays , and Germans . MANY CROATIAN AND Serbian names are still visible where they were etched in the concrete lintels on the With its steel mills as the dominant feature , Gary , Ind. , symbolizes the strength of American industry . Hut something less visible Is beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential pacesetter in attacking bead-on the problems of an urban community . Tribune Task Force reporters spent a month studying Gary , its new black majority , and its struggles whit pollution , crime , and poverty . This first article In a series was prepared and written ? by David Young , Task Force difront of aging tenements and meeting halls . But some new names have cropped Task Force Special : A report on Gary rector , and reporters Pamela ' Lekman . Jerry Thornton , Robert Unger , Thomas Connor , Mid enVir011theld editor Casey Bukro , up beside them , emblazoned in black and atomic pink on signboards and scratched in chalk on brick walls : Soul , Inc. ; Marone House ; and The Kangaroos . Judge Gary probably would n't understand them . They refer to a youth program , a heroin addiction treatment center , and a street gang , respectively . They arc the signs that announce the coming of the blacks and the exodus of the Serbians , Croatians , and Poles . JUDGE GARY also might have trouble understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooks his statue . It is from that window in Gary City Hall that Richard Gordon Hatcher , Cary 's first black mayor , sees a vastly ditferent city than the judge knew . The steel mill is still there to the north of City Hall , but bustling downtown Gary , despite its smattering of vacant business , long ago replaced the shanties that the judge had built , Beyond downtown to the south is Midtown , the city 's black ghetto , where dope peddlers and urban renewal projects dominate the landscape . Still furthey to the south across Int . Hwy. 110 is Glen Park  --  one of the two bastions of Gary 's remaining while population . THAT IS THE view of Gary that Hatcher has from his second floor winclew . But it is the view front the sidewalk below that window that may be more important . It is how the city 's residents standing on that sidewalk see Hatcher and his administration that will determine Gary 's future for the next few years . In Glen Park , the while steelworker does n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything right and the black thinks he can walk on water . Neither one is right , " said James Holland , Hatcher 's aide and adviser . " This is a city where the blacks have political control and the whites have economic control . It creates problems , " said Holland . " It 's a painful adjustment . " Gary 's adjustment problem seems to color virtually every other controversy in the city and makes it a city of contradictions . The real and imagined troubles arc in themselves one of Gary 's major problems . Some are myths , some are half truths , and some are quite real : Problem : Hatcher has mismanaged Gary to the brink of bankruptcy . Conclusion : Myth , The city is relatively healthy economically , altho its fiscal fortunes are tied to the well-being of U. S. Steel , which pays about half of Gary 's taxes . The city has weathered its 1971 fiscal crisis caused by the lowering of U. S. Steel 's tax assessment by $28 Million and the failure to collect more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city officials said . They predict the city is now strong enough to survive an anticipated cutback in federal funds . PROBLEM : Gary 's schools arc terrible . Conclusion : Half truth . Gary 's once model school system slipped as larger numbers of poor children , primarily blacks who had recently immigrated to Gary , occupied more and more seats in the classrooms , But national tests show that the school children are at least holding their own , altho they are still somewhat behind the national average , as are most inner-city kids . For example , 1973 test scores show 6th grade pupils improving at all levels . In 1970 , they were seven months behind the rest of the nation even tho Task Force Special : A report on Gary they were nine months ahead of Chicago 's 6th graders . PROBLEM : Crime is rampant . Conclusion : True . The city 's crime rate has more than doubled in a decade to the point where it now exceeds the rate in the notoriously bad Fillmore District on Chicago 's West Side . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes last year , and someone was murdered every four days . Nevertheless , Hatcher 's war on crime is beginning to show results . The crime rate showed a slight decline last year . " The basic reason people have a distorted picture of crime in Gary is because the news media have hammered it into them , " Hatcher said , PROBLEM : The narcotics situation is out of control . Conclusion : Half truth . Federal authorities called in by Hatcher to help put an end to the city 's drug problem describe it as very open and sometimes amateurish . Altho the heroin that Gary 's eight or nine dealers import is sometimes so weak it does not show up in chemical tests , the city still has anywhere from 2,000 to 7,000 addicts out of a total population of 175 , - 000 . J. Michael Fitzsimmons , head of the federal narcotics operation , still describes the situation as " deplorable " despite the fact that his agents have already obtained more than 50 indictments and some dealers have shifted their operations to nearby East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by local police . PROBLEM : Gary is as corrupt as ever , Conclusion : Myth . The state and federal authorities who audit its books agree that they can find no evidence of corruption . Hatcher claims as one of the major accomplishments of his administration that he has put an end to graft in Gary 's City Hall . PROBLEM : Gary is one of the most polluted cities in the country . Conclusion : True . Despite prodding from federal authorities , the pace at which U. S. Steel is attacking the air pollution problem Is agonizingly slow , authorities say . Gary 's 1972 annual average for dust and soot in the air was 103.6 micrograms per cubic meter , compared with only 85 in Chicago . However , progress has been made . Gary 's 1968 dust and soot rate was 139,3 , and U. S. Steel officials claim they are 90 per cent of the way toward meeting the 1975 federal clean air deadline . PROBLEM : Downtown Gary is dying . Conclusion : Half truth . Downtown sections all over have been hurt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception . Many whites/who claim Gary is dying , say they no longer shop there . But blacks claim their purchasing power takes up the slack . Despite the rather dramatic closing of several large businesses in downtown Gary , retail sales increased 26.5 per cent for the entire city between 1967 and 1971 , versus an Increase of 22.8 per cent for the entire Chicago area and only 7.5 per cent in Chicago itself . " GARY MAY BE dying for some p e o p l e ? people who can not accept change.and long for the good old days . But Gary is not dying , " said Hatcher . " It 's a viable community . " The " good old days " was a time when Gary , a mill town with a reputation as having one of the largest red light districts in the Midwest , was controlled by a political machine , Inhabited mostly by blue collar workers from European backgrounds , and dominated by U. S. Steel . U. S. Steel came first , When It began building its huge mill on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra land , subdivided it , and built houses for the workers . BUT BECAUSE the steel industry had a voracious appetite for unskilled labor , thousands of immigrants from Europe began flocking there to work in the mills . Moving In behind those first immigrants were gamblers , prostitutes , and corrupt politicians . Gary 's first mayor and police chief were indicted for election irregularities within four years of the city 's incorporation . By the time of their indictment , Gary was already known as a sin city . The corruption lasted into the 1960s . In that decade , no fewer than 16 Gary and Lake County officials , including two mayors , were indicted or accused of conspiracies involving payoffs or misuse of funds . ACCORDING TO urhanologist T. R. Sherrard , corruption was inevitable in a town like Gary . Most cities received their immigrant populations on top of stable native populations . Gary did not . " There has never been an elite , a noblesse oblige , a power structure to provide stability , " Sherrard said . " You are really talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The tradition of corruption in city government in Gary was based upon U. S. Steel 's withdrawal from civic affairs , " said one former Hatcher aide in a recently published study . " In tacit exchange for the corporation 's noninterference , it was granted freedom from city government meddling with the mills . " WHILE THE white politicians were Ignoring U. S. Steel and busily sticking their hands in the till , Gary was undergoing a profound change that would spell their doom faster than the courts , the prosecutors , and the juries could put them behind bars . It started during World War II when the booming steel industry began to recruit blacks from the South to man the mills . In 1940 , less than 10 per cent of Gary 's population was black . By 1950 , the number had tripled . Blacks continued to flow into Gary long after the war ended . Sometime during the 1960s , the number of blacks in Gary for the first time exceeded the number of whites . Today , many members of that new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique  --  a barometer which will predict what will happen in the rest of the nation 's major cities . Hatcher is as good a spokesman of that view as any ; according to him : " Gary is a microcosm . It has all the good points and all of the bad points of all major cities . " IT HAS A population of 53 per cent black . Every city in the country is turning black . We have gone thru a lot that will be lessons for every city . " The situation is not that simple , however , one urbanologist explained . Gary is simply not one of the nation 's major cities . Rather , it is a satellite of Chicago with some big city problems and assets . Gary is overshadowed both economically and culturally by its larger neighbor to the northwest . Gary residents watch Chicago television , shop in many Chicago-owned stores , and even live on Chicago time , unlike most of the rest of Indiana . BUT GARY is unlike Chicago or any other major city , in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gary 's residents hold white collar jobs , versus nearly 48 per cent in Chicago . Half of the labor force of 62,610 work in factories , and two-thirds of the factory workers are employed in what census takers call " primary metal industries . " In Gary , that means steel . A casual visitor to Gary is struck by the awesome size of the half-a-billiondollar U. S. Steel complex that stretches for miles along the shore of Lake Michigan . The vast complex is Gary 's heart . It pays half of the city 's taxes , pollutes its skies , and puts bread on most of its tables . The rest of Gary lies to the South as an orderly afterthought of the steel mill 's planners . Like Chicago , Gary 's streets stretch away from the lake in neat patterns . But bisecting the city are two giant ribbons of concrete that conveniently separate the races . East of the Indiana Toll Road is predominantly white Miller , South of Int . 80 is predominantly white Glen Park . BETWEEN THEM live Gary 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black Gary that most of the 8.5 per cent of the population on welfare and 12.3 per cent of the population that is below the federal poverty level live . Those figures , the high when compared with other major Indiana cities , are deceiving . Despite them , Gary enjoys one of the highest median incomes in the state . TILE MEDIAN family income In Gary is $9,819 . The state 's median is only $9,970 . Chicago 's is $10,242
