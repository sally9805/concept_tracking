ST . IVES <P> Directed by J. LEE THOMPSON <P> Screenplay by BARRY BECKERMAN <P> By now , we pretty well know what to expect from contemporary private eyes , especially the ones who work out of L.A. The eponymous hero of this movie has all the predictable particulars . St. Ives ( Charles Bronson ) lives in seedy splendor , books and bed just about filling up the furnished flat in his downtown residential hotel . He has fussy , mildly eccentric eating habits : he likes New Orleans chicory coffee and frequents a cafeteria where the food is more honest than the clientele , which runs mostly to grifters , hustlers and small time sharpies . St. Ives drives a car that is , as required , grittily chic - a black Jaguar sedan that has seen better days . So , of course , has St. Ives . <P> A former crime reporter , now become a freelance crime buster , St. Ives toils away at being a novelist in his spare time . He has more of that commodity than he can handle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , St. Ives snaps it up . An old richie up in Holmby Hills named Abner Procane ( John Houseman ) has had some journals stolen . St. Ives is commissioned as middleman in the trade-off of big bucks for large books , whose precise contents remain a mystery . As the caper proceeds , however , it becomes increasingly clear that whatever is in the books is highly inflammatory , not to say down right dangerous . St. Ives can not help noticing that whoever comes in contact with the books usually - and rapidly - winds up dead . <P> Barry Beckerman 's screenplay offers Director J. Lee Thompson ( The Guns of Navarone ) several good chances to take advantage of the flush , neon lowlife of L.A. Thompson sedulously ignores every opportunity and does not try to sort much sense out of the plot , either . He has all he can do to keep his actors from tripping over corpses . In addition to the ravishing Jacqueline Bisset , who appears as a rather tricky temptress , and Houseman , whose air of hothouse gentility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Ives . No big thing , mind . But he eases through the part with gruff grace and a few hints of low-rent charm . In Breakout , last year 's Hard Times , and now here , Bronson has turned in good , engaging work . It is getting nice to have him around . <P> Jay Cocks
