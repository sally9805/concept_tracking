// On 17 January 1912 Captain Robert Scott and his companions , Wilson , Bowers , Oates and Evans , reached the South Pole to find that they had been forestalled by the Norwegian explorer Amundsen , who had been there one month earlier . My fa  --  ther and his party had 800 miles to walk back , hauling their sledge , to their base camp on McMurdo Sound . They died 100 miles short of theirdestination but only 11 miles from food and fuel ! . The diaries and letter found with their bodies told a story that still fires the imagination of succeed  --  ing generations . The visual images which go with the story were provided by the drawings of Edward Wilson and the pho  --  tographs of Herbert Ponting . I was less than two years old when the Terra Nova sailed to Antarctica . ? Sir Peter Scott The Terra Nova rounded the tip of Ross Island and entered McMurdo Sound . It was decided that winter quarters should be established at Cape Evans , where the ship could be made fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other advantages to the site . A hard week 's work began  --  disembarking and as  --  sembling the hut , landing the stores , pony fodder , fuel , scientific apparatus , provi  --  sions and furniture . Work on the erection of the but pro  --  ceeded swiftly and well . It was a rectangu  --  lar structure with a pitched roof , its walls and roof insulated by double boarding , packed with quilted seaweed . Along the north side were the stables . The south and east sides were given additional insulation by piles of compressed forage bales . A larder for frozen meat was tunneled out of a compacted snowdrift behind the camp . On 17 January , the expedition members took up their abode in the hut , less than a fortnight since their arrival in McMurdo Sound . The " scientific people " got their work spaces organized , Bowers built on a storeroom on the south side , Ponting worked on his darkroom . Clis  --  sold , the cook , made an excellent begin  --  ning and served seal , penguin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1911 , Scott was able to write , " The but is becoming the most comfortable dwelling place imaginable . We have made unto ourselves a truly se  --  ductive home , within the walls of which peace , quiet , and comfort reign su ? preme . . . The word ' hut ' is misleading . Our residence is really a house of con  --  siderable size , in every respect the finest that has ever been erected in the Polar regions ; 50 feet long by 25 feet wide and 9 feet to the eaves . If you can picture our house nestling below this small hill on a long stretch of black sand , with many tons of provision cases ranged in neat blocks in front of it and the sea lapping the icefoot below , you will have some idea of our immediate vicinity . As for our wider surroundings it would be difficult to describe their beauty in sufficiently glowing terms . Cape Evans is one of the many spurs of Erebus and the one that ( Left ) The lonely Terra Nova bore her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thirty-three husk  --  ies sit out the voyage . ed in all those other programs , may  --  be from baby-sitters , who always let them watch TV . " Now I began to feel a bit uneasy about television . You see , I had been in such complete control at first . But then , slowly , all these other pro  --  grams infiltrated , and they seemed to want to watch so many things ! So I decided to limit the time they spent watching instead of worrying too much about what programs they watched , since they seemed to like some programs so much . " But what began to bother me was that John often refused to go out and ride his bike in the afternoon because he preferred to stay at home and watch TV . Well , I fought that tooth and nail ! I 'd explode and have a tantrum and say , ' We 're not going to watch any television if it has that sort of a hold on you ! ' I 'd make a scene about it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about television ! But those never lasted very long . Also , I talked to the school psychologist about the televi  --  sion problem and she told me not to worry , that if John wanted to watch two or three hours of television , it was probably the best thing for him to do . Well , that went against all my instincts , but it was the easiest thing to do , to just let him watch . " When they were six and seven they discovered the Saturday morn  --  ing cartoons . They adored them and would watch them all morning . I ca n't deny that this was great for us , because we 'd be able to lie in bed nice and late while they watched their programs . " Then last year they discovered Jeannie . ' Groan . The combined message of ' Jeannie ' and ' The Flint-stones ' is so sexist that it makes me furious . But the school psychologist assured me that TV is just TV and that kids know it is n't real . " Last year our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was on from five-thirty to six-thirty , but our dinner  --  time was six o ' clock . I 'd tell the kids that if they insisted on watching ' Jeannie , ' they 'd have to turn it off when dinner was ready . They 'd say , Yeah , sure , we 'll turn it off . ' Then I 'd come and warn them that dinner would be ready in five minutes . Then I 'd come in and tell them to turn it off at the next commercial . Of course , they did n't turn it off . I 'd always have to come in and turn it off and they 'd be very angry about this . They 'd say , I hate you , ' and come into dinner shoving and kick  --  ing each other , angry and pouty . " They 'd stay grumpy for the whole meal . It was the worst time of the day , really ! And this went on all year . Every once in a while I 'd get fed up and make threats like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens when you watch ! ' I do n't think I ever made good on those fancy threats . " At this point in the narrative the mother stopped and said to the inter  --  viewer in a changed voice , " This is really a terrible saga , is n't it ? " TAthey turned about with the deliber  --  ate intention of attacking me . The ship was within 60 yards , and I heard wild shouts of ' Look out ! ' Run ! ' Jump , man , jump ! ' ' Run , quick ! ' But I could not run ; it was all I could do to keep my feet as I leapt from piece to piece of the rocking ice , with the whales a few yards behind me , snorting and blowing among the ice blocks . I wondered whether I should be able to reach safety before the whales reached me ; and I recol ? lect distinctly thinking , if they did get me , how very unpleasant the first bite would feel , but that it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already started to drift away with the cur  --  rent , and as I reached the last frag  --  ment I saw that I could not jump to the firm ice , for the lead was too wide . The whales behind me were making a horrible noise amongst the broken ice , and I stood for a moment hesitating what to do . More frantic shouts of ' Jump , man , jump ! ' reach  --  ed me from my friends . Just then , by great good luck , the floe on which I stood turned slightly in the current and lessened the distance . I was able to leap across  --  not , however , a mo  --  ment too soon . As I reached security and looked back , a huge black and tawny head was pushed out of the water at the spot , and rested on the ice , looking round with its little pig-like eyes to see what had become of me . The brute opened his jaws wide , and I saw the terrible teeth which I had so narrowly escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 70 yards to my sledge , by which Captain Scott was standing . I shall never forget his expression as I reached it in safety . During the next year I saw that same look on his face several times , when someone was in danger . It showed how deeply he felt the responsibility for life , which he thought rested so largely on himself . He was deathly pale as he said to me : ' My God ! that was about the nearest squeak I ever saw ! ' " Scott , who had witnessed the whole incident , described it in his journal . He ended his account with these words : " One after the other their huge hideous heads shot verti  --  cally into the air through the cracks that they had made . As they reared them to a height of 6 or 8 feet it was possible to see their tawny head markings , their small glistening eyes and their terrible array of teeth  --  by far the largest and most terrifying in the world . " Preparations for life ashore took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed and the but erected , Scott 's next preoccupation was to lay a large depot to the south in preparation for the Pole journey the following summer . He had hoped to deposit one ton of provisions and equipment on the 80-degree parallel of latitude , but owing to bad weath  --  er and the tender condition of the ponies , the party only reached lati  --  tude 79 degrees 29 minutes south . On the way back , Scott learned that // the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was established with a great many dogs in the Bay of Whales , an indentation in the Great Ice Barrier . Because the sea ice had gone out and there was no way to Cape Evans , the southern depot laying party and the geologists ' party spent some time in the old Discovery but I from Scott 's last expedition making it quite habitable again . Scott was im  --  patient , in spite of all their activities . " But I shall be impatient also in the main hut . It is ill to sit still and contemplate the ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advance must be very different from that which I first contemplated . " ( 17 March 1911 ) . Scott and eight members of the party managed to reach Cape Evans from Hut Point by 13 April 1911 , the Thursday before Easter . Wilson was left behind with Oates and five companions at the Discovery hut , waiting for the sea ice to become firm enough to hold the ponies . On Sunday , 23 April , the sun shone for the last time . A night watchman was instituted , mainly for the purpose of observing the aurora during the long winter night . A series of lectures was also started , the first by Wilson on " Antarctic flying birds , " the second by Simpson , the meteorologist , on " Coronas , halos , rainbows and auroras . " Scott re  --  marks on the way the values of a polar expedition are not those of daily life in the outside world . " I do not think there can be any life quite so demonstrative of character as that which we had on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under ordinary conditions it is so easy to carry a point with a little bounce ; self-assertion is a mask which covers many a weakness . As a rule we have neither the time nor the desire to look beneath it , and so it is that commonly we accept people on their own valuation . Here the out  --  ward show is nothing , it is the inward purpose that counts . So the ' gods ' dwindle and the humble supplant them . Pretense is useless . " On 13 May , the remaining men , ponies and dogs arrived safely from Hut Point . The wintering party was complete . The expedition members settled down companionably and cheerfully to the months of Antarc  --  tic winter in the hut , during which time they would not see the sun . The regular daily routine became well established and Scott describes it as follows : " Clissold is up about 7 a.m. to start the breakfast . At 7:30 Hooper starts sweeping the floor and setting the table . Between 8 and 8:30 the men are out and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to feed the ponies , Demetri to see the dogs ; Hooper bursts on the slumberers with repeated announce  --  ments of the time , usually a quarter of an hour ahead of the clock . There is a stretching of limbs and an inter  --  change of morning greetings , gar-nished with sleepy humor . Wilson and Bowers meet in a state of nature beside a washing basin filled with snow and proceed to rub glistening limbs with this chilling substance . A little later with less hardihood some others may be seen making the most of a meager allowance of water . Soon after 8:30 I manage to drag myself from a very comfortable bed and make my toilet with a bare pint of water . By about 10 minutes to 9 my clothes are on , my bed is made , and I sit down to my bowl of por  --  ridge ; most of the others are gather  --  ed about the table by this time , but there are a few laggards who run the 9 o'clock rule very close . The rule is instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has needed a little pressure to keep one or two up to its observance . By 9:20 breakfast is fin  --  ished , and before the half-hour has struck the table has been cleared . From 9:30 to 1:30 the men are steadily employed on a program of preparation for sledging , which seems likely to occupy the greater part of the winter . The repair of sleeping bags and the alteration of tents have already been done , but there are many other tasks uncom  --  pleted or not yet begun , such as the manufacture of provision bags , crampons , sealskin soles , pony clothes , etc . " Hooper has another good sweep up the but after breakfast , washes the mess traps , and generally tidies things . I think it a good thing that in these matters the officers need not wait on themselves ; it gives long un  --  broken days of scientific work and must , therefore , be an economy of brain in the long run . " We meet for our midday meal at 1:30 or 1:45 , and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterwards the ponies are exercised , weather per  --  mitting ; this employs all the men and a few of the officers for an hour or more  --  the rest of us generally take exercise in some form at the same time . After this the officers go on steadily with their work , whilst the men do odd jobs to while away the time . The evening meal , our dinner , comes at 6:30 , and is finished within the hour . Afterwards people read , write , or play games , or occasionally finish some piece of work . The gram  --  ophone is usually started by some kindly disposed person , and on three nights of the week the lectures to which I have referred are given . These lectures still command full audiences and lively discussions . " At 11 p.m. the acetylene lights are put out , and those who wish to remain up or to read in bed must depend on candlelight . The majority of candles are extinguished by mid  --  night , and the night watchman alone remains awake to keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day after day passes in this fash  --  ion . It is not a very active life per  --  haps , but certainly not an idle one . Few of us sleep more than eight hours out of the twenty-four . Continued on page 96 " On Saturday afternoon or Sun  --  day morning some extra bathing takes place ; chins are shaven , and perhaps clean garments donned . Such signs , with the regular Service on Sunday , mark the passage of the weeks . " Scott 's birthday was celebrated on 6 June . " After my walk I discov  --  ered that great preparations were in progress for a special dinner , and when the hour for that meal arrived we sat down to a sumptuous spread with our sledge banners hung about us . Clissold 's especially excellent seal soup , roast mutton and red currant jelly , fruit salad , asparagus and choc  --  olate  --  such was our menu . For drink we had cider cup , a mystery not yet fathomed , some sherry and a li  --  queur . After this luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... They are boys , all of them , but such excellent good-natured ones ; there has been no sign of sharpness or anger , no jarring note , in all these wordy con  --  tests ; all end with a laugh . Nelson has offered Taylor a pair of socks to teach him some geology ! This lulls me to sleep ! " With the return of the sun toward the end of August , people were able to get out and about more . Amund  --  sen left his base on the Bay of Wales on 19 October 1911 with four com  --  panions , four sledges and fifty-two dogs , crossed the ice shelf , ascended the unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier , and reached the South Pole on 17 December 1911 . Scott 's two motor sledges left on 24 October . They made slow prog  --  ress with frequent stops . " I find myself immensely eager that these tractors should succeed , " he wrote , " even though they may not be of great help to our southern advance . A small measure of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revolutionize Polar transport . " He was right , of course , and tracked vehicles have since been much used in the Antarctic . The motor sledges lasted for less than a week . The ten ponies plodded south with their loads and were shot when their useful life was over and cached as dog food . The last ponies were shot at the foot of the Beard  --  more Glacier in " Shambles Camp . " The weather proved very disappoint  --  ing and blizzards and soft snow de  --  layed the march south . The dogs and the various other supporting parties were sent back at intervals , until on 4 January 1912 , beyond the Beard  --  more Glacier , one hundred and fifty miles from the Pole , Scott sent back " Teddy " Evans , Lashly and Crean and retained Wilson , Oates , Bowers and Edgar Evans for the last stretch . They marched on skis over the frozen waves of sastrugi at a height of nearly 10,000 feet until on Tues  --  day , 16 January , they found ( in Scott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearer ; sledge tracks and ski tracks going and coming and the clear trace of dogs ' paws  --  many dogs . This told us the whole story . The Norwegians have forestalled us and are first at the Pole . It is a terri  --  ble disappointment , and I am very sorry for my loyal companions .... " They reached the South Pole on 17 January in bitterly cold , damp weather against a head wind force four to five . " Great God ! " , wrote Scott , " this is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have labor  --  ed to it without the reward of priori  --  ty . " They had a " fat Polar hoosh , " despite their chagrin and the next day came across a Norwegian tent . In it were the names of those who had been there and a note from Amund  --  sen to Scott , asking him to forward a letter to King Haakon of Norway . " We built a cairn , put up our poor slighted Union Jack and photograph ed ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have turned our back on the goal of our ambition and must face our 800 miles of solid dragging  --  and good-bye to most of the daydreams ! " They were unable to complete those 800 miles . Evans died at the foot of the Beardmore Glacier . Oates walked to his death in a blizzard , to save his comrades , 18 miles south of the last camp of Scott , Wilson and Bowers , who themselves died in their tent of cold and starvation , prevent  --  ed by the blizzard from struggling the last 11 miles to One Ton Depot , where they would have found food and fuel . 2.7 Book Rewriewe continued from page 80 Author Safire can write fiction like a whiz . Never mind that he is no Tolstoi . He would n't think so him  --  self . But he 's got a plot , he knows his scene , he 's a great judge of pace , and he is something of an expert on dia  --  logue . The following is just a modest example of it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House says something it does n't have to be on the level of a Disraeli addressing a Gladstone in the House . Situation : President Ericson has a cold . Solution : The White House physi  --  cian Dr. Abelson comes in to see his blind patient . " Abelson went in the Oval Office , told his patient to roll up his sleeve , and took Ericson 's blood pressure , which was on the high side , but normal for him . He stuck a ther  --  mometer in the presidential mouth , and as he was taking the presi  --  dential pulse , said ' I saw Buffie in the Mess at lunch . She 's got the hots for you and wants to know why I 've been keeping you two apart . ' " ' Mpf , ' the President said . " ' So if you want , I 'll deliver her to the third floor around ten tonight . Your calender says you 're having dinner at seven with the A. G. Up to you . ' " Ericson took the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and put it back . " ' Do you good , ' the doctor agreed , as he pulled down a lower eyelid . ' You got a cold , or what ? ' " ' You are the personal physician to the President of the United States , ' Ericson said , taking the thermometer out again . ' You get paid sixty thousand dollars a year by the taxpayers to keep the closest possible tabs on the Presi ? dent 's health . What would they say in the medical schools of this na tion if they knew you just said , " You got a cold , or what ? " ' " " Ah , but can they edit a medi  --  cal magazine ? ' " ' If I could see , Herb , I 'd read this thermometer for you . You want to send it to Bethesda ? ' " ' You got ninety-nine and a half . That 's a little temperature . You sound like you got a cold . Maybe what I 've had the past cou  --  ple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin and an anti histamine . Here 's for starters . ' The President took his pills . ' Take it easy today , Sven . Save your strength for tonight . ' " You gather that the book may be highly recommended for its entertainment values and familiari  --  ty with the big and little wheels in the Oval room . One of the more diverting parts of Safire 's story ( and it is , curiously enough , pursued to much the same degree in the other novels ) is the attempt , as we see above , to make the President " human " through the device of sex . The reminder is that although he 's the most powerful man in the world , he can get as lonely or as stirred up emotionally as you and I. In this respect , al  --  though Safire has himself a bach  --  elor President , and has cleared him  --  self very neatly on moral grounds by that gambit , he almost makes President Ericson too human . How  --  ever , we 'll let that be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say how often a President needs a roll in the hay ? Bless his heart , we can only hope it does him good and that his satis faction bodes well for the country , as well as for himself . After reading Full Disclosure , you 'll wind up admiring Satire as an author , and there 's one thing about the book which is so " human " that you ca n't help liking Mr. S. personal  --  ly for it . As we mentioned , there 's a nice smattering of sex throughout the novel , handled with taste , by the way . However , author Safire simply could n't resist controlling his plot in one rather disarming way . In his book , the President 's speechwriter somehow manages to wind up with the boss 's girl . Well , as Safire may have reasoned , if you ca n't write it the way you want it in your own book , why bother at all ?                     @ @
