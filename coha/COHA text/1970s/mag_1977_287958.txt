Fighting fire with computers <P> In the vast tundras of Alaska and in the timberlands and national parks of California , Oregon , Arizona and Utah , forest fires have devoured huge swaths of magnificent territory . Most of the blazes have been started by heat lightning , and many are still out of control . Alaska has lost 1.6 million acres , or 2,500 sq . mi. , in the worst destruction since 1971 . California , the most scorched after Alaska , has lost more than 288,000 acres , despite the deployment of 10,000 fire fighters . <P> The most mammoth blaze along the West Coast is in the Los Padres National Forest , just east of California 's lovely Big Sur . Roaring on for two weeks , the inferno has consumed 92,200 acres , feeding on miles and miles of vegetation turned bone-dry by a two-year drought . A Forest Service official says the energy ignited in every 1,000 acres of the compacted underbrush is equivalent to that of the " bomb dropped on Hiroshima . " <P> Authorities have sent in 4,856 fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax-and " McClouds " -a wide rake . On twelve-hour shifts , the crews cut brush and trees with hand tools and chain saws to bar the approaching blaze . Most find the service exhilarating . Said one woman from Santa Cruz : " It 's the most exciting thing anyone can do . " <P> Foresters have used enormous D9 Caterpillar tractors to help dig a 60-mile fire line around 40% of the blaze . Hoping to squeeze off some of the rest , Al West , an official of the Los Padres National Forest , ordered the construction of an eightmile , 30-to 40-ft. - wide road , cut by eight bulldozers near the fire 's northern edge . West wanted to save an additional 25,000 acres of wilderness that forms the Carmel Valley Watershed ; the effort failed , and now the water supply for 20,000 people around Monterey is threatened . <P> Ten planes have unloaded about 700,000 gal . of phosphate flame retardant on the fire , at a cost of nearly $4 million . To plot where and when the flames will strike next , experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest and computers that analyze information about terrain and weather forecasts . With no rain in sight , the battle is expected to continue for many more days .
