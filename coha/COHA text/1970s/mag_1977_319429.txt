Now a mature 49 , the brilliant scientist-manager was near the top of Jimmy Carter 's talent list from the first . <P> Brown 's choice as Defense Secretary pleased many bureaucrats at both the Pentagon and State Department . Some military men regard him as too " soft , " but others see him as an effective administrator with a superb grasp of weapons systems .

A year later he moved to Defense , first as director of research and , from 1965 to 1969 , as Secretary of the Air Force .

He has a close-knit family life with his wife Colene and daughters Deborah , 21 , and Ellen , 20 . Every morning he swims laps in his backyard pool for precisely 30 minutes . Reserved in public , Brown can be arrogant . But Pentagon officials approvingly recall that during the ' 60s he got along well with uniformed officers and Congressmen after overcoming their initial suspicions of him as an insufferable boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
