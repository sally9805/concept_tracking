txt Governor Rockefeller 's proposal last week that the State University of New York take over the City University of New York  --  and eliminate the no-tuition policy at city colleges  --  was called by some critics " a callous attempt at political image-making . " City students are shown in an earlier protest demonstration against paying tuition . The idea , of merging the City University of New York ( C.U.N.Y. ) and the State University of New York ( S.U.N.Y. ) has been kicking around for nearly a decade . It has regularly surfaced at budget time , when the city presses for more state financing and Albany says it is already paying enough . But last week the idea packed more wallop than usual : Governor Rockefeller , who in the past has advocated increased state control over the City University , personally recommended that S.U.N.Y . take over C.U.N.Y. He said , in his State of the State message : " With the city 's fiscal problems , and with the rapid increase in the state 's financial support of higher education , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public colleges , by making the City University part of the State University system . " The merger proposal , which would mean the end of the City University 's 125-year-old policy of no tuition for undergraduates , had the effect of a bombshell in higher education circles . An Ad Hoc Committee for City University , composed of 60 groups including prestigious civic and religious organizations , branded the Governor 's call for a takeover " a callous attempt at political image-making at the expense of the poor and the disadvantaged . " C.U.N.Y. has 218,000 students at 10 senior colleges and eight community colleges . Full-time undergraduates , who make up more than half the , enrollment , pay no tuition ; graduate students and part-time undergraduates pay tuition scaled to their programs . C.U.N.Y. 's enrollment has been swelled the past two years by the open-admission policy , which permits any high school graduate in the city to attend the university . The City University this year has an operating budget of $381.2-million . The state contributes half the operating costs of C.U.N.Y. 's senior colleges and 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This comes to $145.6-million , or 18 per cent of Albany 's higher education budget of $809.4-million . S.U.N.Y. , which is the country 's largest university , has 348,000 fulltime undergraduates on 72 campuses scattered across the state . Tuition currently is $550 a year for full-time undergraduates , and is expected to go up to $700 by the fall of 1973 ; part-time undergraduates and graduate students pay tuition scaled to their programs . A merger would require the approval of the State Board of Regents and the Legislature . Following are some advantages that might flow from a union : o Most observers agree that In the long run there would be benefits in terms of planning and administration , provided there remains enough in the past decade . And , of course , S.U.N.Y . has tuition . A merger without imposition of equal tuition on city and state campuses is virtually a political impossibility . Moreover , those who want to end free tuition say that , even if the payments would not actually provide much actual income , it would end the free ride for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upstaters whose children are kept out of state university campuses by present admission requirements would inevitably demand the same open-admission privilege enjoyed by New York City residents . This would call for rapid , costly expansion . At the same time there would be pressure to bring the crammed City University 's facilities on par with those of the state campuses . ? Administration . One of S.U. N.Y . ' s problems is the rigid control exercised by the state 's , rather than the university 's , fiscal bureaucracy . It would require legislative action to bring about reforms toward the greater academic autonomy enjoyed within the City University . Some opponents of a merger contend that tuition at C.U.N.Y. within the context of the open-admission policy would be more costly in the long run , because of the preponderance of low-income students . Though imposition of tuition could shut out many students who could not afford the charge , the theory is that the tuition would be offset by scholarship aid to this type of student .

HECIHIMGER Rockefeller 's Plan : Bombshell For the City University autonomy to allow the urban city university and the largely smalltown , residential state campuses to respond to their particular conditions and constituencies . ? There would be inevitable gains in an easier interchange of students , including the channeling of applicants to campuses relevant to their interests as well as spreading the enrollment burden more evenly . Perhaps most important , with open admission for all high school graduates already guaranteed by the City University , the concept of open access to higher education would be made far more equitable and manageable on a statewide basis , as it is in California . Despite these possible advantages , an instant merger faces the following formidable obstacles : ? Tradition . The City University , the outgrowth of City College , prides itself on 125 years of independence , with that jealously protected trademark  --  free undergraduate tuition . By contrast , the State University was founded in 1948 and has only really come into its own             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
