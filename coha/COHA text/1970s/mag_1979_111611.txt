In 56 years only two men have served Time Inc. as editor-in-chief . The first , Henry R. Luce , founded this company . His successor , Hedley Donovan , gave it a second generation of editorial growth . On June 1 he retires from the company . // Donovan came to Time Inc. with a magna cum laude degree from the University of Minnesota , plus an Oxford degree acquired as a Rhodes scholar . He put in five years as a newspaperman in Washington , then most of World War II in the U.S. Navy . A 1945 personnel memo details these and other qualifications , going on to note that " young Donovan is a handsome gentleman of 31 , with blue eyes , a level gaze , a deep voice and a serious manner enlivened by a quick smile . " None of that description needs to be changed today except , inevitably and unbelievably , 31 has become 65. // Beginning as a writer on FORTUNE in December 1945 , Donovan moved up to managing editor less than eight years later . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its editor-in-chief in 1964. // Since then his guidance and governance have been reflected in each of our magazines and in Time-Life Books and The Washington Star as well . He helped transform Time Inc. from the largely personal domain of its brilliant founder into a publicly held , diverse company while preserving , we feel , its essential spirit and broadening its range . With great strength of character and a formidable intellect , he guided our publications through the bitterly divisive years of Vietnam and Watergate , reaffirming or changing editorial policy . // It was under his leadership that Time Inc. , in a remarkable six-year burst of creative activity , gave birth to two new magazines , MONEY and PEOPLE , rebirth to LIFE and turned FORTUNE from a monthly into a fortnightly . // Time Inc. has a long tradition of separating editorial responsibilities and business management . The editor-in-chief reports not to the chairman or president of this company but to the board of directors , which can exercise no immediate editorial supervision . Hedley Donovan 's immense authority  --  sometimes delegated , never diluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unthinkable to poach on his editorial territory , his own profound judgment in non-editorial matters was often called upon . // Succeeding Hedley Donovan as Time Inc. ' s editor-in-chief will be Henry Grunwald , Viennese-born and TIME-nurtured . Grunwald began working for The Weekly Newsmagazine as a copy boy , while still an undergraduate at New York University , in 1944 . The following year he became a writer , advanced to senior editor  --  the youngest ever  --  at age 28 , and to managing editor in 1968 . After a nine-year tenure , during which the magazine changed considerably , he was appointed one of two corporate editors . // The other corporate editor was Ralph Graves , who now becomes Time Inc. ' s editorial director  --  in effect , deputy to Grunwald . Graves , who joined us immediately after graduating from Harvard in 1948 , was managing editor of LIFE between 1969 and 1972 , and held other important editorial as well as publishing positions . // The legacy of the Donovan years is a rich one , most obviously in staff and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am confident that Grunwald will not only safeguard that legacy , but with the help of Graves and unmatched editorial talent on this and every other Time Inc. magazine , will further enhance it . // Andrew Heiskell Chairman of the Board Time Inc.
