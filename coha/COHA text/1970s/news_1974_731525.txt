txt by Lester G. Maddox , Georgians have ended a colorful but contentious political era In the Deep South . Out of nowhere arose a quiet-spoken state representative , George Busbee of Albany , who trounced Mr , Maddox In his bid for election to a second term as Georgia 's governor . Mr. Busbee will have Republican opposition In November ? either Atlanta businessman Harold Dye or Macon Mayor Ronnie Thompson . The two Republicans were separated by only a few votes as counting continued a day after the election . For more than a decade , Mr. Maddox has symbolized Southern resistance to Integration and to the power of the federal government over state affairs . Perhaps only Gov . George C. Wallace ( D ) of Alabama , among Southern politicians , has generated more headlines . Mr. Maddox was overwhelmed by a " New South " coalition of newly registered blacks ( 28 percent of Georgia 's voters ) and moderate and liberal whites , especially In metropolitan areas . // *Maddox defeated : a political era ends // This same coalition in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to elect such fresh faces as Gov . Reubin Askew ( D ) of Florida , Gov . Dale Bumpers ( D ) of Arkansas , and Gov . Winfield Dunn ( R ) of Tennessee . Such a new face is George Busbee : a small city attorney ; buttoned down collar ; " shy , " according to his friends ; a behind-the-scenes leader who generally stayed out of the newspapers . Six months ago , one poll found , 91 percent of the people of Georgia had never heard of him . Although generally regarded as a conservative , Mr. Busbee was able to weld together the support of blacks ( including an endorsement by state Rep. Julian Bond ) , whites from cities , and many voters from small towns . At the same time , he managed to run almost neck-and-neck with Mr. Maddox in rural regions . Issues surfaced in the race , but they all proved secondary to the biggest issue of all ? Lester Garfield Maddox .

It was Mr. Maddox 's son , Lester Jr. , who brandished a pick-ax handle in defense of the restaurant and helped the ax handle become national symbol of resistance On the stump , the Maddox appeal was as old as apple pie and the Fourth of July . He quotes the Bible , waves the flag ( U.S. and Confederate ) , denounces " left-wing , Communist , socialist " ideas stalking the country . He was as much an entertainer as a politician ? peddling his bicycle backward around the state capitol as he peddled his philosophy of private property rights . For some Georgians , the Maddox fight against Washington was a classic , populist **32;1231;TOOLONG battle that won him a permanent niche in their hearts .

Maddox , speaking to supporters after his defeat , blamed news coverage In part for his loss . Throughout the campaign , Mr. Maddox charged that the Atlanta newspapers , the Journal and the Constitution , were leading the fight against him . Meanwhile , Nevada 's Republican primary election to fill the U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Alan Bible was won by former Gov . Paul Laxalt , who piled up 9-to-1 margins against two opponents . In the Democratic Senate primary , Lt. Gov . Harry M. Reid soundly defeated Maya Miller and a second opponent .
