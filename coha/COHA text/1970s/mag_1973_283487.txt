To his friends , Astronaut Charles ( " Pete " ) Conrad Jr . is known as " Mr. Fixit . " During his youth , his mother recalls , he spent hours with Erector sets , model planes and finally cars and motorcycles . While in quarantine after his Apollo 12 moon-landing , he assembled a complex stereo system . Last week the 43-year-old Navy captain continued to live up to his reputation as Houston 's No. 1 amateur mechanic . During a daring and dangerous four-hour walk in space-the longest ever attempted-he and Fellow Astronaut Joseph Kerwin freed Skylab 's jammed solar wing , thus probably saving the mission and brightening chances for the completion of the $2.6 billion Skylab program . <P> Power Shortage . As Conrad and his crew ended their second week in space , those chances seemed dim indeed . Skylab 's power shortage-which resulted from the jamming of one solar panel and the loss of another during launch , when the orbital workshop 's meteoroid and thermal shielding ripped off-had suddenly been compounded by a severe new problem . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more batteries were performing far below normal , apparently because of excessive heat and overuse . When another battery faltered in midweek ( only to revive mysteriously the next day ) , NASA officials feared that the mission might have to be drastically curtailed . <P> They pointed out that the loss of only one more battery might 1 ) force the shutdown of the orbital workshop , 2 ) require the halt of all major experiments - including important biomedical tests - and 3 ) compel the astronauts to retreat to the cramped quarters of the Apollo command ship . <P> Having sufficient battery power was vital to the mission . Every time Skylab was in the earth 's shadow-for some 30 minutes during each 90-minute orbit - the production of electricity by the four working windmill-shaped solar panels atop the telescope mount ceased , leaving the lab completely reliant on its batteries . Freeing the jammed solar wing thus assumed even greater importance : it could provide Skylab with another 3,000 watts of electricity while it was in sunlight and charge up eight idle batteries connected to the wing . <P> Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astronaut Paul Weitz-leaning out of the Apollo command module-had attempted to pull the jammed wing out with a long-handled tool that resembled a boat hook . But a 2-ft. - long scrap of aluminum from the ripped shield was so tightly wrapped around the bottom of the wing that it would not extend . <P> NASA 's engineers and technicians , who had already displayed extraordinary Yankee ingenuity in fashioning Skylab 's makeshift sunshade , refused to give up . Experimenting with duplicates of tools aboard Skylab , they devised techniques for cutting , sawing and even prying off the metal . Practicing with these tools in simulated conditions of weightlessness in NASA 'S big water test tank at Huntsville , Ala. , Backup Astronauts Rusty Schweickart and Ed Gibson demonstrated that the implements might well work in space . <P> Thus Mission Control gave the astronauts permission for the space walk . After donning their pressure suits , all three astronauts moved from the orbital-workshop area of Skylab into the multiple docking adapter . Then , while Weitz remained behind , Conrad and         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
