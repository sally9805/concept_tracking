If Henry Kissinger 's Middle East marathon was a grueling chore for him , it was also something less than a honeymoon for his new wife Nancy . Like her husband , she was constantly shadowed by a hovering clutch of Secret Service men on the breathless course from Algeria to Egypt to Jordan , and back and forth between Syria and Israel . One of the agents even swam parallel with her , stroke for stroke , when she came down to the pool from the sixth-floor apartment that she and her husband occupied at Jerusalem 's King David Hotel . <P> Though Nancy went along only on one of the 13 shuttles to Damascus , she managed to meet nearly every dignitary her husband dealt with during the month , from Hafez Assad to King Hussein to Moshe Dayan . Almost invariably she would stand with her right knee bent , so her willowy 6-ft. figure would not tower over shorter men . In addition , she touched a few bases that Henry missed , managing to meet with a passel of VIPs and not-so-VIPs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a swank restaurant near Jerusalem ) to Dr. Mieczyslaw Rodziewicz , a young Polish archaeologist who was working near Alexandria . She commiserated with his exasperation upon discovering a new apartment building above a potentially rich dig . <P> Mrs. Kissinger showed a genuine interest in archaeological and religious sites . In Damascus , she visited the ancient Umayyad mosque and the Turkish baths . There she startled her conservative Muslim guide by asking whether men and women had ever bathed there together . The horrified guide said , " Oh , no , no ! " He then added that women had been allowed to bathe but separately . In Israel , she toured the fortress at Masada where Jewish zealots made a suicidal last stand against the Roman Legion in A.D. 73 . Later she helicoptered to the ruins of Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee . Near the site , she chatted in fluent French with a Franciscan friar . <P> In upper Egypt , her exhausting itinerary included treks to the distant temples of Luxor , Karnak and Abu Simbel , with the Aswan dam thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ordeal was considerably mitigated by the warmth of the Sadats . Said the Egyptian President : " You are a part of Henry 's family here . " <P> Like her husband , Mrs. Kissinger has a remarkable store of nervous energy , as well as a streak of impatience . For the most part , though , she maintained considerable composure in living with the erratic schedule of the drawn-out disengagement talks . She played her role with great dignity and effect , hardly ever becoming flustered . Her clothes , from sporty jackets to dresses to pantsuits , were always appropriate and immaculate . Even when she walked about the Air Force 707 in her stockinged feet , a reporter could not help noticing that her toenails were color-coordinated with her clothes .
