To have perfection hurled at you in the split second of seeing that woman sitting in my car . . . The result of centuries of war and pain . No casual pleasure brought about those features . There was some great loss somewhere . Some great horde of peoples have suffered to bring about that nose arched in such a way as to exert power over my every hidden appetite . And she is black as all things secret . The dark corners of nature lurking in the shadows , shielded from the enemy . Black today is nature 's hiding place . Where she stores her loot .
