" History is littered with the wreckage of governments that could not deal adequately with inflation-and I will also suggest that history is littered with the wreckage of finance ministers who spoke the way lam speaking right now . " <P> - Secretary of the Treasury <P> William Simon <P> The Cassandra tone typifies Simon 's current role-and his questionable future in Government . Once supremely confident of his ability to deal with what he called the nation 's " infinitely solvable " economic problems , he now sees himself as the sound-money " conscience " of the Government , repeating dire warnings that he knows few politicians want to hear . To a nation frightened by the deepest recession and highest unemployment since before Pearl Harbor , Simon insists that inflation is the greater long-run peril . To a Congress bent on cutting taxes and raising spending far more than the Administration wants , Simon endlessly preaches the dangers of overstimulation . His gloom seems excessive , but he is making some points worth heeding . <P> Advocating Slack . Last week , for example , Simon told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget deficit of $80 billion in the fiscal year that begins in July , v. the $55.5 billion projected by the Office of Management and Budget . That is a real and worrisome possibility , but Simon 's warning would carry more force if he had shown a keener and earlier appreciation of the need for vigorous action to pull the nation out of recession . Instead , Simon has insisted that " some margin of economic slack must remain for a period of years to ensure that inflation can be squeezed out gradually . " <P> <P> This line is seriously eroding Simon 's influence in Congress . A year ago , when he was the nation 's energy czar , even liberal Democrats viewed him as a pragmatic problem solver . Now many consider him a rigid conservative ideologue . <P> Within the Administration , Simon 's hard-driving ways and disregard of bureaucratic protocol have always made him more enemies than friends . In recent policy debates he has pushed his views too stridently , and his clout is visibly diminishing . <P> On economic and energy policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Economic Adviser Alan Greenspan , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Energy Administrator Frank Zarb . Simon 's role can only be further reduced by the arrival in Washington of Harvard Professor John T. Dunlop , who took over last week as Secretary of Labor . <P> Dunlop , who will have a major voice in policy , leans far more to Government intervention in the economy than does Simon . <P> A few weeks ago , President Ford pointedly contradicted Simon on a significant issue . Simon had declared that Kissinger 's proposal to put a floor under oil prices , so that developers of alternate energy sources could be sure that their prices would not be undercut , was not Administration policy . Ford then had Press Secretary Ron Nessen declare that it was indeed his policy . Since then , Simon 's confidence , in his influence if not his beliefs , has seemed shaken . Once fiercely independent , he now takes care to go over proposed congressional testimony with White House aides . Many in the Administration doubt that Simon will still be around next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
