FRANK Yes sir , President King , sir . CAPTAIN KING I never have been a buffalo . And I never will be a buffalo . I thought we were all building my new clubhouse . Get to work . I want the walls to go right out to here . And in this corner there will be a lookout tower and there will be an elevator going upto it .

PIP I 'm twelve feet high . FRANK So am I. CAPTAIN KING I can build my own ship . PIP I can see the top of the trees . I can see the sky and the sun and the edge of the park and the city and the lake . CAPTAIN KING And my ship is the flagship . It will lead the fleet . PIP There 's a whale on the lake .

There were storms . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mist . PIP We could build any boat .

I never have been a whale and I never will be a whale . PIP Now say we were in a circus and we 'd climbed right to the top of the tent and we had to dive off into the net . ALL jump , doing forward somersaults when they land . KING is more and more determined to take over . FRANK How do you know what 's real and what is n't ? PIP I tell stories , that 's all . FRANK I know that . PIP Because building a clubhouse you are never going to finish is not very interesting . FRANK No . CAPTAIN KING No ? PIP ( ignoring KING ) So I make up a story about it .

CAPTAIN KING For example ? PIP For example , last week Mope and I were playing in Mr. Roberts ' front yard . FRANK You are n't supposed to play in Mr. Roberts ' yard . CAPTAIN KING That 's right . PIP We were pretending . It was the dead of night . There was no light . Anywhere . Except the moon , sometimes , coming out from behind a cloud , just for a moment . There 's a tree in Mr. Roberts ' yard and there was something moving behind the tree . Maybe it was just a shadow . We did n't know for sure . We stopped and listened . There was a strange sound . There is a strange sound from KING . He is making his bid for control . FRANK That was Mr. Roberts . PIP Mr. Roberts does n't sound like that .

PIP What ? FLIP No dogs on the grass . No people on the grass . No trespassing . PIP It was awful , Frank . There was a huge flash of light and suddenly , Mr. Roberts turned into a dragon . CAPTAIN KING And the tree turned into a dragon ! FLIP That 's not the way the story goes . You turned into a dragon egg . CAPTAIN KING An egg ! FLIP Yes . CAPTAIN KING I did n't . FLIP You did . CAPTAIN KING I hatched ! FLIP You hatch next January . FRANK ( to PIP ) You were scared , eh ? PIP Yes . And Mope was scared . A little .

CAPTAIN KING Roberts does n't know anything about dragons . He 's only pretending . He does n't know soup from soap . He does n't know a bicycle from a fire engine . He does n't know anything . FLIP , playing Roberts , spins PIP around . FLIP Of course . Pip ! My nephew ! PIP After all these years . FLIP And no one ever mentioned you . PIP Surprise .

This is the CBC Sports Final bringing live coverage of the fight between Roberts and Pip and we join the action just as round one begins . Pip , on your right , is bowing to his opponent . Obviously , The dragon fight can include any number of special turns . The original production included a karate contest , a reel , a couple of amazing high leaps , a fashion show , a tango and a tug-of-war in the first round . and a simultaneous French commentary . If the latter is n't practical , either FRANK or KING can act as cameraman , technician , scorekeeper or cheerleader . FRANK And they are bowing to the audience . They are bowing to the announcers . . . CAPTAIN KING Bonjour , mesdames et messieurs , ici Radio Canada , ils vous salutent , ils nous salutent. . . p. 23 FRANK Pip was born in Toronto .

Roberts the Dragon is an old hand at this sort of contest , although last year he was suspended for six months for roughing . There has been no roughing this afternoon .

CAPTAIN KING C'est ca , mesdames et messieurs , de la bouche du chien . p. 25 FRANK There you have it , ladies and gentlemen , straight from the dog 's mouth . In the second round , it is customary for Pip to be handed the magic sword ( someone does ) and we expect that Roberts will concede at that point . Yes , Pip has the sword now . She is drawing the sword . Roberts retreats . Yes , Roberts has conceded . MOPE , FRANK and Roberts congratulate PIP on the fight . CAPTAIN KING ( singing ) I could kill dragons if I had the time Heroes in a comic book are three for a dime Hour after hour in a President 's day Is obligation , duty . . . it is work and not play .

PIP So ? FRANK So we better start cleaning . FRANK and FLIP and MOPE all clean furiously . p. 26 CAPTAIN KING This is wonderful . We 've been working all summer . Because we all knew that if we did work all summer we would build a new clubhouse . And here it is . Just as I pictured it . Now all we have to do is carry in the winter provisions . The popcorn and the popsicles and the popovers and the soda pop . The ketchup , the mustard and the mayonnaise . And clean everything . Absolutely , positively , definitely , completely and utterly clean . Clean as a whistle . ( blowing it ) Then we 'll be ready for winter . Get to work , everybody .

A toasted cheese sandwich and a mug of cocoa before you go to bed , just to wet your whistle so to speak . ( blowing his whistle ) Lots of blankets . Porridge for breakfast .

PIP ( singing ) My friend 's feet are so big that they flap in the breeze She can bend her toes backward they come to her knees So she 's glad on the days that the leaves leave the trees And the day that the cold in the air makes her sneeze When school started she went back as quick as you please She was glad when the hockey rink started to freeze She can slide down the hills with the greatest of ease Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skis CAPTAIN KING That 's the silliest story I ever heard .

( continuing the story , but slower , much less animated , not so sure of herself ) She skated and slid on the ice and the snow Her feet were so big like the wind she could go But the East Wind would howl and the North Wind would blow And she thought she had frozen an ear and a toe She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for someone who might say hello . . .

Help ! p. 31 ALICE Woof ! PIP I guess it 's more fun with more people pretending . Mope , do you believe what Captain King says ? That everybody has to do something , and telling stories does n't count ? ALICE Woof ? PIP It 's lonely , Mope , is n't it ? Maybe we should pretend we 're inside with Frank and Flip and Captain King . And if PIP pretends something , it happens . But as we might have suspected , all is not well with KING and FRANK and FLIP . They are bored . KING is trying his best to be entertaining , without really admitting that anything is wrong .

Well , since we have nothing to do , I 'm going to tell you a story . It was a dark and stormy night . It was very cold . It was so cold that it was n't raining rain , and it was n't sleeting sleet and it was n't snowing snow . It was icing icicles . I had icicles hanging from my arms and I could n't move my arms . I had a big icicle hanging from my nose and I could n't move my head . And every time I opened my mouth to catch my breath , I got a mouthful of icicles . I looked up . I saw a huge family of penguins , so I knew I was in Antarctica . FRANK and FLIP grab at penguins. p. 32 FRANK Penguins ? FLIP Penguins ? CAPTAIN KING Antarctica FRANK Penguins ?

CAPTAIN KING Because there is a river here . There are rocks . There are rapids . So what can you do ? FLIP Build a bridge . CAPTAIN KING That 's right ! So the penguins built the bridge across the river so that they could cross to the picnic tables and the penguin food . p. 33 FRANK And then what happened ?

CAPTAIN KING On the other side . And he was a very cowardly penguin and he was afraid to cross . Someone is delegated fourth penguin and runs back to do the cross . p. 34 FRANK Then what happened ? CAPTAIN KING And the fifth penguin , who was also a very cowardly penguin , crossed the bridge . No one except KING is interested in being fifth penguin .

CAPTAIN KING But the bridge did n't fall down . FRANK I wish you knew better stories . CAPTAIN KING There was a herd of walrus and the first walrus  --  FRANK I wish Pip were here . CAPTAIN KING I 'll tell another story . FLIP Never mind , Captain King . FRANK It 's all right . We 'll just sit here . CAPTAIN KING Any kind of story . Your favourite kind of story .

( to the audience ) What can I tell a story about ? KING and the kids in the audience decide on the subject of a story . KINGs role in this dialogue should be helpful and enthusiastic . FRANK and FLIP can turn down as uninteresting any ideas that seem unpromising , or can choose from a number of suggestions . The format of the improvisation that follows is another shaggy-dog type story which never quite gets off the ground . The improvisation is better if FRANK and FLIP are given the opportunity for movement . If the suggestion is a dog , cat , fish , etc. , this is easy . If the story is supposed to be about a tree or grass or some other immovable object , then that object can be lost and FRANK and FLIP , playing kings or football players or storekeepers or whatever , can go and look for it . The possibilities are limited only by your facilities . The following story is fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING Once upon a time there was a king ( . . . of Mars , or whatever the suggestion is ) and he had a box he could n't open .

He saw three pyramids and he knew that in one pyramid there was a golden key that would open the box . The king had a servant . ( to FRANK ) You be the servant . And he called him and said , " Go and open the pyramids and find the key and bring it back to me and we can open the box . " FLIP Go and open the pyramids and find the key and bring it back to me and we can open the box . CAPTAIN KING And the servant said , " All right . " FRANK All right .

( This is KING 's part in the story and he enjoys it ) p. 37 FLIP Then what happened ? CAPTAIN KING Then the servant came back to the king and the king said . " Did you find the key ? " FLIP Did you find the key ? CAPTAIN KING And the servant said , " No . " FRANK No . KING is getting more and more involved in the story but FRANK and FLIP are more and more annoyed . CAPTAIN KING So the king said : Well I know the key is there so you go back and look again . FLIP I 'm tired of sitting here , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes . FLIP Pip knows better stories than that . In the fury of improvisation , it is better to avoid saying : I do n't want to do this any more , or , I do n't want to be the dog , because the kids in the audience will occasionally volunteer . CAPTAIN KING I 'm going to sing a song for you . ( singing ) My name is Captain King I really like to sing I sing throughout the night and the day When I walk down the street The people that I meet Say : What is your name ? And I say : My name is Captain King I really like to sing I sing throughout the night and day When I walk down the street The people that I meet Say : What is your name ? And I say : My name is Captain King I really like to sing . . .

Find all three of them . I should n't have sung that song . I ca n't sing . I should n't have told those stories , either . I 've never been able to tell stories . Sometimes I think I 'm only the president because I talk the loudest . It 's lonely being a president without a club . I wish Pip were here . Or Mope . Here , Mope . Here , Mope . ALICE is a little suspicious . She growls . CAPTAIN KING Hi , Mope . I wish you were my dog . A dog can be a good friend and a friend in need is a friend indeed . We could talk to each other . ALICE Woof . CAPTAIN KING Where 's Pip ? ALICE ( agitated ) Woof . Woof . CAPTAIN KING You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if she does n't do anything useful . ALICE ( agitated ) Woof . Woof . CAPTAIN KING No , I did n't mean that . You can tell her that she can join . Even if she does tell silly stories . ALICE is worried . She is trying to lead KING somewhere . p. 39 CAPTAIN KING No , I did n't mean that . Tell her I want to be friends . And when she comes back , we 'll have a party . In the club house . What 's the matter , Mope ? ALICE is barking . Running in circle . PIP 's " drowning " , like all the other stories , is mimed . PIP Help ! CAPTAIN KING Pip is in trouble . FRANK Pip is drowning in a pool of quicksand . PIP Help ! FLIP There is no way we can reach her from the edge of the quicksand . I fly over her . I try to reach down for her but I 'm going too fast . FRANK And I try to build a bridge out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fall . ALICE And I save you . I save Frank and pull him to shore . FLIP And we make a human chain , from the edge of the quicksand out to the middle of the pool . PIP Help . FLIP Flip and Alice and Frank . FRANK But we ca n't reach her . CAPTAIN KING And I help . I hold on to a tree . p. 40 FLIP Flip and Alice . ALICE And Frank and Captain King . FRANK And we reach her . We pull her to shore . The rescue is accomplished . The COMPANY sings : Surprise , surprise , surprise , surprise Clap your hands , slap your thighs Welcome home , welcome home Ever more welcome , however you roam . Captain King will bring you At incredible expense This fantastic celebration This supreme experience . It 's a real extravaganza An incredible display It 's liberal , it 's lavish Your red letter day . ( Chorus ) Captain King will bring you His wild horses , his brass band It 's a party for our best friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you by Captain King Is a song of praise to raise hoorays And make the rafters ring . ( Chorus ) CAPTAIN KING I did it . I made up a story . PIP We all made up the story together , Captain King . p. 41 CAPTAIN KING That 's a good way to do it . When one person ca n't think of what to say . I could make up a song about the story . ( singing ) The day that Pip fell in the quicksand She could n't reach land She could n't stand . . . ( spoken ) No . That 's the silliest song I ever heard . ALICE Woof ! CAPTAIN KING You could help me , Alice . ALICE Woof ! CAPTAIN KING You do n't have to be the dog all the time , Alice . ALICE I do n't ? CAPTAIN KING You could help me make up a song . ALICE I could ? CAPTAIN KING If you want to . ALICE and COMPANY sing the closing song . My best friend is twelve feet high Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , my best friend Why does Flip think he can fly ? Hey , my best friend Do n't know how and do n't know why . Hey , my best friend , Hey my best friend , Hey my best friend . Slap my knee and slap my thigh I know how to multiply Got a nickel , what 'll I buy How many stars are in the sky ? Way up in the clouds so high Saw a dragon in the sky Caught a bird as it flew by I 've been here since last July . Sometimes I 'm afraid and shy , Got an apple in my eye Turned it into apple pie I might bake it next July . I can wear a shirt and tie I wish I were dignified No , I would n't tell a lie I laughed so hard I split my side . Saw a pretty butterfly No green dragons need apply Had to give this song a try Now it 's time to say goodbye . ( END OF PLAY. )         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
