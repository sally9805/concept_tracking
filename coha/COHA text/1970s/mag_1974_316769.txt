When Richard Lamm came to live in Colorado in 1961 , he spotted a flock of geese a few feet inside the state border . He stopped his car , stepped out , drank in the unspoiled scenery and told himself , " This is the place . " Ever since , he has tried to keep Colorado the way he found it-a battle for the environment that spurred his political rise and carried him into this year 's gubernatorial race . In a victory that showed a majority of Coloradans share his concern , he defeated the popular incumbent , John Vanderhoof , by 441,144 votes to 379,298 . <P> Lamm 's victory would not have been possible without a dramatic change in the state 's electorate . Over the past few years , Colorado has been invaded by Easterners and Westerners alike , anxious to escape urban blight and sprawl , and , ironically , more concerned than the natives to protect their state 's natural beauties . For them , the environment is the overriding issue . A rather traditional booster who looked forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Vanderhoof , 52 , did not get the voters ' message until fairly late in the campaign . Then he joined Lamm , 39 , in opposing a ski-run development and further nuclear blasting on the Rockies ' western slopes in an effort to extract natural gas . But Lamm , a leader of the successful drive to keep the Winter Olympics out of the state , had already made the environmental issue his own . " I have a compass in my head , and Vanderhoof has a very fine scale , " says Lamm . " Generally the scales win in politics , but not here and not now . " <P> A native of Madison , Wis. , Lamm speaks less with the measured drawl of the Westerner than with the rapid-fire delivery of the transplant . But zealous as he is on the environment , he is no extremist . " I am a politician of the finite , " he says , and he fully expects to cooperate with Republicans , who are scarcely less alarmed about the future of their state than Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or opting for a steady state economy , " says Lamm . " But growth has to be controlled . What we 're really demanding is that growth pay its way . " Unless it does , he fears that Colorado will soon resemble the ravaged landscape of West Virginia . " We 're all happy to be Americans , " says this new-style states ' - righter , " but we 're not going to let you rip us off . " <P> Lamm has been dubbed a one-issue man ; a tough land-use plan he sponsored in the legislature lost by a single vote , and he plans to push it again as Governor . But he has also supported a variety of other causes . He managed to win passage of the nation 's first therapeutic abortion law in 1967 . He was a major backer of no-fault insurance ; he fought so hard for child-abuse legislation that admirers floridly called him " champion of the battered child . "                    @
