Needed : Someone to lead the Old Blue out of the red <P> It could almost be the College of Cardinals , sitting in secrecy to elect a new Pope . There are closed-door sessions around a huge octagonal table , beneath the gaze of portraits of past presidents . The participants-members of the Yale Corporation , Yale University 's august board of directors-breathe not a word about their deliberations . There is even an executive secretary who vigilantly collects every scrap of paper after each meeting , carries them home and carefully burns them in his fireplace . <P> And rather like the white smoke above the Vatican that marks the election of a new Pope , the wisps coming out of Yale Professor Emeritus Edgar Boell 's chimney lately have been signaling the imminent end of Yale 's seven-month search for a successor to Kingman Brewster , who resigned last April to accept the ambassadorship to the Court of St. James 's . Last week William Bundy , chairman of the corporation 's eight-member presidential search committee , announced that the list of candidates to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten finalists . Early next week the 18-member corporation will meet in Washington , quite probably to make the final choice . <P> Strict secrecy shrouds the identity of the ten . But a dozen or so names keep turning up . Among them : outsiders Harvard Dean Henry Rosovsky ; Stanford President Richard Lyman ; and Thomas Ehrlich , former dean of Stanford Law School , now president of the Legal Services Corporation . The list may also include two former Yale undergraduates : William Muir ( ' 54 ) , a professor of political science at Berkeley , and Prosser Gifford ( ' 51 ) , a Rhodes scholar and dean of Amherst since 1967 . Among Yale faculty members and administrators thought to be on the list are A. Bartlett Giamatti , director of humanities division , and Hanna Holborn Gray , Yale 's provost and , after Brewster 's resignation , acting president . <P> Gray , daughter of Yale historian Hajo Holborn , is an expert in European intellectual history who was educated at Bryn Mawr and Harvard . As acting head of Yale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is weathering a bitter two-month strike by the university 's 1,400 blue-collar workers . " She 's head and shoulders over the other internal candidates , " says one respected faculty member . Yet , he adds , " many of the Old Blues , on whom the university is dependent for much of its future funding , would never accept a woman as president . " <P> Brewster 's successor will inherit a salary of about $85,000 , a stately mansion - and Yale 's grave financial problems . Over a decade , the university 's cumulative deficit has climbed to $16.6 million . Last year , Yale spent $209 million and ran $6.6 million in the red , the largest annual deficit in its history .
