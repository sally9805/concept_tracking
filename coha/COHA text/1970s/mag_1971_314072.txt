If i think some of you have gotten exceedingly busty because you are carrying tape recorders , I might question how you gained weight . You are here as guests , and guests do not wander around taking notes . Please introduce yourself to the . guests just as any nice , well-brought-up lady would do . Circulate , and take mental impressions . <P> That was not Amy Vanderbilt speaking . It was Pat Nixon 's staff director and press secretary , Constance Cornell Stuart , lecturing Washington 's lady journalists on how to cover formal receptions . " I do n't know which made me more furious , " recalls one White House reporter . " Her patronizing lecture or the phoniness of pretending that reporters are guests . We 're there because we write about it . " <P> Connie Stuart , 32 , is there because she majored in drama at the University of <P> Maryland , went into public relations , and married Charles Stuart . Charles has been part of the Nixon team since 1968 ; he moved into the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehrlichman , is now an aide to Bob Haldeman . When Pat Nixon fired her first press secretary , Gerry Van der Heuvel ( who , among other things , had wanted to work for Hubert Humphrey ) , there was Connie , with recommendations from two of Nixon 's closest men . <P> White House insiders feel that ebullient Connie was hired to improve Mrs. Nixon 's image-to present her as more warm and friendly . But Connie says that is not the reason at all . " I serve one master-Mrs . Nixon . I was not brought on board to ' create an image ' for the First Lady . She has a very natural manner , and has no intention of changing . She made this clear when we talked before I took the job . She told me , ' No one is going to change me or the way I do things . ' " Nobody has . <P> That is one reason why Connie has come under fire from the Republican women surrounding the First Lady : " She is not doing anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthpiece , Martha Mitchell , who recently added Connie to her list of early morning phone calls . Connie had neglected to give Martha credit as hostess for a luncheon attended by Mrs. Nixon . Declared Martha : " Connie is trying to get rid of me because I announced to the press that I called her at 5 a.m . " <P> Connie does have her drawbacks . The night of the White House ball for Prince Charles and Princess Anne , for instance , the press had been barred beyond the receiving line , and reporters had to rely on Connie for color and anecdote . Yet Connie overlooked the early deadlines of East Coast morning papers , and nothing could be written for the first editions . When she finally sashayed into the press room , she giggled that she had little to report because " the British mistook me for an American reporter " and would not talk . The New York Daily News 's Ann Wood growled : " We 'd never make that mistake , Connie . " During the Nixons ' last trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering Mrs. Nixon with no one to brief them . Where had she gone ? Connie had a moose-hunting date in Canada with her husband and she had flown off to keep it-and , incidentally , to bag a moose .
