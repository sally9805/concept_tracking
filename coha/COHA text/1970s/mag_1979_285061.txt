How the publishers got stung <P> Several of us read your untitled novel here with admiration for writing and style . Jerzy Kosinski comes to mind as a point of comparison when reading the stark , chilly , episodic incidents you have set down . The drawback to the manuscript , as it stands , is that it does n't add up to a satisfactory whole . " <P> Not bad , as rejection slips go . Except . . . what Houghton Mifflin , the rejecting publishers , did not know was that they were on the receiving end of a sting . The manuscript they turned down in 1977 was a freshly typed copy of Steps , a Kosinski novel that had won the National Book Award in 1969 . <P> Houghton Mifflin is the publisher of three Kosinski novels , including his best known , The Painted Bird . But consider the embarrassment at Random House . They rejected the identical Steps manu script nine years after they had published it . In all 14 publishers and 13 literary agents failed to recognize the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself Erik Demos . Demos is the nom de hoax chosen by Chuck Ross , a Los Angeles freelance writer out to prove what thousands of aspiring first novelists already know : it is virtually impossible for an unknown author to break into print through the U.S. mails with what is known in the trade as an " over the transom " manuscript . One of the extremely rare exceptions to the rule was Judith Guest 's Ordinary People ( 1976 ) . <P> In the latest issue of New West magazine , Ross discloses that he first conducted the Steps experiment in 1975 . At that time he sent 21 pages of the book to four publishers . Results of this first total rejection were published in Harper 's Bookletter , a now defunct biweekly . That article also contained Kosinski 's advice that next time Ross should offer the entire text of Steps . <P> When he did , two years later , not a memory trace of the first episode remained in the publishing world . Rejection slips again crowded Ross 's mailbox . " While your prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the content of the book did n't inspire the level of enthusiasm ... " After a long delay , Random House sent a form letter , and an editor at William Morrow postscripted a consolation : " Sorry , I liked the opening gambit . Why do n't you find an agent ? " <P> Not a chance . The agents offered a chorus of refusals . " It seems too fragmented and dreamlike to be a good commercial bet , " wrote Lurton Blassingame . " We regret that we do not have the time here to read unsolicited fiction , " explained James Brown . Candida Donadio &; Associates demurred with , " When all is said and done , we felt the manuscript lacked that all-important dramatic tension . " And from the office of Knox Burger after two follow-up letters from Ross : " I 'm very sorry , but we have no record of having received your MS. or postage . ' Kosinski is philosophical about the fact that his award-winning , experimental novel rang no bells : " Thank God it means different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , and how many politicians would be recognized from what they said ten years ago ?
