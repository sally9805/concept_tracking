THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AN old friend dropped by our office one morning last week and said he wanted to tell us about a wonderfully quiet and pleasant subway ride he 'd taken the day before . We gave him a sharp look . Had he had a few too many ? Absolutely not . He was n't talking about New York at all . He was describing a ride he 'd taken on Mexico City 's new subway , the Metro . " The Metro cars run on pneumaticrubber-tired wheels and make scarcely a sound  --  no more than the faint rustle of leaves in a light breeze  --  as the trains glide in and out of a station , " he said . " I had read about similar rubber-tired cars in the Paris and Montreal subways , but until any visit to Mexico 's Metro I 'd had no notion of how quiet a subway could be . At first , it 's eerie  --  the absence of noise and racket when you 're not accustomed to it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , but I do think a noiseless subway is a priceless gift to mankind . Now , just a word about the Metro 's stations , and I 'll be on my way . Each is literally a work of art , and has its own character . The design and ornamentation are imaginative throughout , often based on carvings and sculpture from the great archeological sites . ? Vhen the excavation for one station ran unexpectedly into a buried pyramid , plans were hastily changed to save the pyramid and make it a feature of the station The subway platforms and the spacious mezzanines above them  --  reached by escalators  --  are attractively paved in variegated hues of highly polished marble , which mappers keep cleaning all day long . The subway walls are often brightened with sections of colorful tile  --  red , yellow , rust  --  or with large photo murals , in color or black and white , depicting scenes from Mexico 's past and present . So far , no litter , no ads , and no graffiti . A visit to the Metro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority . They should see it and weep . And imagine how astonished they 'd he at the Metro 's instant success as a place for Sunday family outings  --  an occurrence that even the Metro management was n't prepared for . It had gone in for plenty of promotion , including free excursion rides , to encourage people to use the subway , but it had completely overlooked a related matter ; namely , how to get them to get off the subway . This oversight became apparent on the Sunday after the official opening . I have an eyewitness account here of what happened then : ' Tens of thousands of cfudadones , laden with children , baskets of tacos , and bottles of Pfreseos swarmed over the platforms and into the coaches and settled down to enjoy their first underground picnic . As they glided merrily hack and forth from one end of the line to the other , they caused Mexico 's first subway jam , but it was clear that they had found the Metro an ideal substitute for Chapultepec Park , particularly on a rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller coaster , was sensational . ' Well , that 's about all , except for the fare , which is just under ten cents in our money , or only eight cents if you buy a block of five tickets . " Having finished his report , our friend bade us atfijs and added , with a grimace , " Now I have to take the damned to Flushing . " Meters SHORTLY after our friend 's visit , our own interest m subterranean New York led us to spend a few hours accompanying a Con Ed meter reader on his rounds , and at seven-fifteen on a sunny morning we met Victor Lombardo , by appointment , on the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue and Ninety-seventh Street . Mr. Lombardo , who is a pleasant-looking man of thirty-five with wavy black hair , and has been a meter reader for the past eleven years , out of fourteen that he has been with Con Ed , was in uniform- - gray trousers , light-blue shirt , and dark-blue jacket , with " Con Edison " stitched in light blue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case containing extra bulbs and batteries , for his flashlight , and a stack of cards  --  one for each meter he was to read that day . All Manhattan is divided by Con Ed into nine zones , and Lombardo is one of fifteen meter readers in I ) Zone , which runs from Eighty-ninth Street to 136th Street between Fifth Avenue and the East River . Computers print the cards and arrange them by route and in sequence within each route , and Mr. L. had picked up his cards for that day 's route  --  the route happened to he numbered 06-403 ? the previous afternoon at I ) Zone 's headquarters , on West 125th Street . His working day is from seven-fifteen to three-forty-five , with half an hour for lunch . On Route 06-403 , he would do two hours of " skips " ? meters in other areas which meter men had failed to read because no one was at home when they came . The cards in Lombardo 's leather case did n't have the customers ' names on them , but each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer 's Con Ed account ; the number of the customer 's meter ( the number was followed by " E " or " G , " to indicate whether an electric or a gas meter was involved ) ; the location of the meter ( " B " standing for " basement , " " MRM " for " meter room " ) ; numbers showing the anticipated reading range for the meter ; and a box with the heading " Irregular Conditions " ( e.g. , " Can not locate meter , " " Meter damaged " ) . Lombardo handed us an extra flashlight that he had kindly brought along , and the two of us walked west toward the first building on Route 06-403-1 ( 18 East Ninety-seventh Street , one of many four- and five-story walkups on a Hock that had obviously seen better days . At No. 108 , we rang the hell marked " Superintendent . " From behind the front door , a man 's voice asked , " - Who is it ? " " Con Edison , sir , " Lombardo replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dim , bare gray corridor to the basement stairs , and on down into the basement . Lombardo had a card for each of thirty-two meters he was to read in the building  --  seventeen electric and fifteen gas . Fifteen of each were for the building 's fifteen apartments ; the two extra electric meters were for the building 's hall lights and its furnace . The basement of No. 108 , like its corridor , was long , narrow , tidy , and dark . At one end of it was a pile of lumber , and at the other end was a pile of coal , through which Lombardo made his way to read the building 's two electric meters . Several old doors had been stacked in front of some of the other electric meters , but they did n't present a serious obstacle The meters were round and had four 111.1121- bored dials , which Lombardo read from right to left , Chinese-fashion , recording his findings on his cards . Below the dials was a disc that registered the consumption of electricity as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number on the right-hand dial advanced a digit . In some cases , the disc was moving slowly , in some cases quickly . Pointing to a slow-moving disc , Lombardo said , " Probably there 's just an electric clock or a radio going in that apartment . " Then he pointed to a disc that was turning quickly and said , " Here 's a good customer . Must have a toaster or an iron on . " The gas meters were rectangular and had three dials . Lombardo told us that some gas meters have as many as six and that gas-meter discs move too slowly for the eye to follow . The reading for one gas meter was 131 . Lombardo showed us its card , which gave the reading range as 090-110 , and explained that he had to mark a special box on the card to show that he had verified the reading . After reading all the meters , he put No. l 08 's thirty-two cards away in his leather case and took nut his cards for the next building on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went outside , Lombar do lit a cigarette  --  he is not allowed to smoke on a customer 's premises  --  and he had time for a few puffs before we got to No. 114. kVhcn the super of No. 114 , a middle-aged woman , opened the front door , Lombardo asked her how she was . " I 'm tired , " she said . We waited in the hallway while she went into her apartment to get her keys . " Some people maybe did n't sleep so good last night , " Mr. L. said . " A cheerful good morning often starts them off right . " He had fifteen gas and sixteen electric meters to read in the basement of No. 114 , Five of them were in the boiler room , where the bulb was out and we put our flashlights to use . The others were in the main part of the basement , one wall of which was decorated with framed photographs of a Negro wedding that must have taken place fifty or sixty years ago ; the bride was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morning coat and high button shoes . The superintendent pointed to the maid of honor and told us she had lived in an apartment in the building ; when she died , no one had wanted the photographs , so the superintendent had put them up in the basement . " The frames are nice , " she said . We proceeded across the street to No. 129 and rang the superintendent 's hell . There was no answer . Mr. L. rang a tenant 's bell , and the tenant buzzed us in without asking us who we were or what we wanted , but the door to the basement , where the meters were , was Locked . try the building later , " Lombardo said . " Then , if I get no answer , either an inspector or a man doing a round of skips will come back another time . If we still ca n't get into the basement , we may send out cards and ask the tenants to read their own meters , or we 'll estimate their bills and correct them when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few puffs on another cigarette as we walked east and crossed Lexington Avenue . Our first stop in the block between Lexington and Third was 133 East Ninety-seventh Street , where a dog in a ground-floor apartment had used his nose to push the slats of a Venetian Mind apart and was peering out at us . Lombardo knew the super , a woman , front previous tours of duty on Route 06-403 , and they exchanged small talk . II the nasement , Lombardo read fifteen electric meters . The gas meters were in the apartments . The super said that wane of the tenants were Chinese people , who worked ; she did n't think we 'd find many at home . One of six tenants we found at home lived in the apartment with the dog . As soon as Lombardo saw it , he asked , " How 's the dog ? All right ? " The tenant said it was . " I 've been bitten twice , " Mr. L. remarked . " Once by a German shepherd . Once by a little guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs . One of them was big , so I told her to hold him . She did , and the small one bit me . " Dogs are only one hazard of Lombardo 's trade . Some children Once locked a basement door behind him . He knew that the superintendent was home , so he found the fuse box and unscrewed some fuses , and the super hurried down to the basement and released him . Violence is another hazard ; several of his colleagues have been mugged . All the meters for 145 and 147 East Ninety-seventh were in the basements of the buildings , and Lombardo read them without ado . At 149 East Ninety-seventh , the gas meters were in the basement , the electric meters in the apartments  --  a reversal of the usual arrangement . At one apartment , a woman did n't respond to " Good morning . Con Edison " but ? i us in when Mr. L. said " Hombre lrr luz , el gas " ? a few useful Spanish words he has picked up in the line of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call let Lombardo in to read the meter . From the doorway , we could see the doctor 's patient lying in bed  --  a woman who seemed to be quite old and quite ill , Outside the building again , Lombardo said , " You see some depressing sights . When you get home , you 're more grateful for what little you have . " Four of No. 149 's tenants were out . " The number of meters you can read in a day depends on the buildings on the route , " Lombardo said . " If there are a lot of tall apartment houses , with all the meters in the basement , you can read more than on a route like this or on a route with a lot of private houses . " Our next stop was 151 East Ninety-seventh , a Telephone Company building . An employee escorted us to the basement , where numerous large machines were working away noisily . Lombardo read three electric meters and one gas meter . Then we headed for a sign commending J. &; B. Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the northwest corner of Ninety-seventh Street and Third Avenue . Having waded through the litter , Mr. L. found that the sign 's meter had been smashed . He reported the damaged meter on the appropriate card . " If a meter is broken , we note it and go on , " he said . " But if we 're reading meters and we smell gas , we shut off the gas , phone headquarters , and wait until our emergency crew arrives , " We walked west to 140 East Ninety-seventh Street , where Lombardo got the key to a sidewalk trapdoor from a TV-and-air-conditioning store on the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue . He had to crouch as he went down the steps to the basement , and when he gut the-re he found it so cluttered with air-conditioners and junk that he had to read the meters from a distance of seven or eight feet . A dry-cleaning establishment on the southeast corner of Lexington and Ninety-seventh gave us the key to a trapdoor leading to the basement of 142 East Ninety-seventh . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through mud and slime to get to the meters . When he came hack up , he wiped his shoes and told us that Con Ed footed the bills for dry-cleaning his uniforms . It was now close to noon , and we gave 129 East Ninety-seventh another try , on the chance that the super had children who would be home for lunch , but there was still no answer from the super 's apartment . On our way from Ninety-seventh Street 's faded walkups to the somewhat more elegant buildings around the corner on Park Avenue , Lombardo finally had a chance to smoke a whole cigarette . The meters he had read thus far were generally meters for which customers received bills every two months . In the remaining buildings on the route , he was going to read not tenants ' meters but just a handful of building meters for which monthly readings were scheduled . The basements of 1230 and 1220 Park Avenue  --  large apartment houses  --  were a contrast to the others we had been in The basements in the Ninety-seventh Street walkups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnaces amid the pipes . The basements of 1230 and 1220 Park were far more extensive , and hummed with activity . Elevator men , doormen , handymen , and maintenance men were about ; tenants and laundresses were using the laundry rooms ; delivery boys carrying groceries in paper cartons were waiting fur the service elevators . We entered No. 1230 and No. 1220 and most of the other buildings on the . route 6 East Ninety-sixth , 12 East Ninety-sixth , 16 East Ninety-sixth , 50 East Ninety-sixth , 60 East Ninetysixth , and 70 East Ninety-sixththrough service entrances , and Mr. L. read six or eight meters in each without running into any problems . It was after one when he finished , and we stopped for lunch at a quick-and-dirty on East Ninety-sixth and talked shop , which he said was not unusual for him . " If another meter reader has a nearby route , you sometimes get together for lunch , " he told us . " We discuss things like had superintendents and other conditions . 1 . when I hand in anti cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , they 're taken down to our main building , on Irving Place , with the other meter readers ' cards , The computers handle them from there . They print the hills and everything . I 've heard that meter-reading may be done electronically someday  --  the way the Phone Company reads most of its bills  --  but I 'm not worried . Con Ed will give me something else to do . But I like reading meters . I like talking to different people , and being outside , and being on my own . It gives you a sense of responsibility . " We remarked that we had n't seen any rats on Route 06-403 , and Mr. L. said that he had n't , either , and that he did n't often see any on Ninety-eighth Street , where he 'd he working the following day . " Ninety-ninth Street is about the dividing line , " he said . " You usually start seeing rats and fleas above Ninety-ninth . We call it the jungle in small talk between ourselves . That 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why so many people have so much and so many so little . " Secretary Mickel ? lATE 'RE finalizing plans for Sec- ! ' ? retary flickers visit to New York , " said an assistant to Walter Jo-seph Hickel , the thirty-eighth Secretary of the Interior , in a telephone call to us from Washington . " Could you be at the Waldorf Towers at exactly 9 A.M. tomorrow ? " At exactly nine the next morning , we were seated in Secretary Hickeys Waldorf Towers suite with him , with Mrs. Hickel , and with Josef Troffcy and Alexander A. Holbert , two of the Secretary 's assistants . Secretary Hickel , wearing a dark-gray suit with a blue-and-gold striped tie , and looking a little grim and a little impatient to get going , faced us side.wise from an armchair . Mrs. Hickel , trim and slim in a navy-blue dress , a redwhite-and-blue silk scarf , and medium-heeled navy-blue pumps , sat against a far wall facing us directly . The two assistants flanked everybody . Mr. Hickel looks like television 's Perry Mason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Perry Mason sureness of manner . He is fifty years old ; is a native of Claflin , Kansas ( pop . 921 ) ; is one of ten children , among whom he is the eldest of six boys ; was born and raised on a wheat farm ; graduated from Claflin High School in 1936 ; won the Golden Gloves welterweight championship of Kansas in 1938 ; bought a Claflin insurance agency when he was nineteen and sold it two years later ; and set out for Australia to seek his fortune , got as far as Los Angeles , where he had trouble obtaining a visa , and so took a train to Seattle and a ship to Seward , Alaska , and decided to settle for Alaska instead of Australia . During the Second World War , Secretary Rickel was a civilian inspector for the Air Force . After the war , he started a house-building business in Anchorage and branched out into building hotels and motels . He is a former chairman of the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce 's Economic Development Committee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Company ; a former trustee of Alaska Methodist University ; a member of the Board of Regents of Gonzaga University , in Spokane , Washington ; a former Republican National Committeeman ( for ten years ) for Alaska ; a former leader in Alaska 's fight for statehood ; and a former governor ( elected in 1966 ) of Alaska . He is married to the former Ermalee Strutz , daughter of pioneer Alaskans of Anchorage . They have five sons : Robert , twenty-two , a senior at the University of Santa Clara , studying business administration ; Walter , Jr. , twenty-one , studying business administration at the University of Alaska ; Jack , nineteen , a sophomore at the University of San Francisco ; Joseph , fifteen , a freshman at Western Junior High School in Chevy Chase ; and Karl , seven , a first-grader at the Little Flower School in Bethesda . Secretary Hickel 's eldest son , Theodore , twenty-seven , by an earlier marriage ( his first wife died in 1943 ) , is married , lives in Portland , Oregon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been going on in the Department of the Interior since you took over ? " we asked Secretary Hickel . " To begin with , we should really call it the Department of Resources and Environment , " he began , talking fast , in a don't-giveme-an-argument tone . " People do care how they live . We 're in charge of the protection and development of what we have in this country . It 's a challenge I THE NEW YORKER readily accept and think I can handle . I 've gone into our coal mines in the interests of improving health and safety conditions . I 've gone to the Florida Everglades to fight alligator poaching and to try to stop a commercial jetport proposed for that area . I 've been to Santa Barbara to look into the oil spill and to Alaska to look into developments on its North Slope . I 've been working on a multibillion-dollar program for urban parks  --  our Parks to the People program . One of the first of these parks , by the way , will he the Gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica Bay area . I 'd like to see our American Indians get a full share of responsibility in developing and operating their own programs . I 'd like to see an early and equitable settlement of Alaska native-land claims . We 're trying to minimize chances of pollution from offshore gas exploration and operation , and we 're trying to participate in exploring the oceans for maximum future utilization of their fisheries , minerals , and other resources . The greatest single challenge , of course , is that of water pollution . We 've got to stop it . " " Are you getting support for your programs ? " we asked . " The American people are genuinely environment-conscious , " Secretary ' Hickel said . " As a matter of fact , environment is one of the hottest issues going in Washington . Politicians are suddenly aware of the fact that support of environment , like support of motherhood , is good politics . Fortunately , we all stand to win by this environment consciousness . Right now money is short . The President is fighting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm an impatient man . Rather than have programs ready up to the point of money and then wait , I am proposing other financing methods . Cleaning up our waters is Number One on my list of priorities . Appropriations for this from Congress wo n't be enough , even if we get a billion dollars . We need funds not only for this 3 ear but for every year down the road for at least six or seven years . So I 'm thinking of long-term contractual financing  --  spreading payment over , say , thirty years  --  on top of federal appropriations we might get . It 's going to take at least ten billion dollars just to be able to get abreast of the problem with waste-treatment plants . " " Has your life- changed any since you came to Washington ? " we asked . " Ha ! " Mrs. Hickel said . " It has n't changed a hit ! " " In public service , your time is never ? your own , " Secretary Hickel said . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Environmental Quality Council . I 'm the chairman of its Standing Committee on Outdoor Recreation . I 'm the chairman of the Water Resources Council . I 'm a member of the Delaware River Basin Commission . I 'm a member of the National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Development I 'm a member of the Rural Affairs Council . I 'm the chairman of the National Park Foundation Board . I 'm the chairman of the National Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Surveillance . I 'm a member of the Federal Radiation Council I 'm on the Board of Trustees of the National Recreation and Park Association . And I 'm still a member of the Arctic Club , in Seattle , of the Pioneers of Alaska , and of the Alaska State Society , and I 'm an honorary-member of the Alaska Rotary Club and the Alaska Native Brotherhood . And in Washington I 've got a social event of some kind nearly every evening . " " Do you like it ? " we asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in it , " Secretary Hickel said . " I did n't have any mica conceptions when I took the job . " " Hal " Mrs. Hickel said again . ? " I said from the beginning the only way I 'd get Potomac fever was if I drank water out of the Potomac River , " Secretary Hickel said . " It 's so polluted it 'd give anybody a fever . " He gave a quick laugh . Mrs. Hickel , Mr. Troffey , and Mr. Holbert gave one quick laugh each . " How is your job different from being governor of Alaska ? " we asked . " Alaska has unique problems , with its vastness , with its two oceans and three seas . But the fisheries , the Indian problem , the resources all come tinder the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior . Most of my adult life has been spent under the jurisdiction of the Department , you might say . It was the greatest training ground for this job . We 've got a million square miles of continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there 's so much to be done . We 've got to have a revaluation of all the public domain . We must inventory and catalogue our natural resources , whatever they may be , depietahle or renewable , and we have to figure out what is the best use of those resources . A program of all preservation is obviously wrong . We have to use our resources in order to live . And a program of all development is just as wrong . We most have a balanced program . That 's my view . Fortunately , I have good rapport with
