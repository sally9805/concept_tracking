The tomb of King Tutankhamun , who came to the throne in 1352 B.C. and died in 1343 , was not built by slave labor . Free ( but lazy ) men wrote excuses about why they could n't work on a particular day ; one laborer had to attend a sick donkey to the vet , another had to bury a favorite aunt though evidence showed archaeologists he had already buried her three times . The evidence of these excuses was found on bits of pottery , ostraca ( the Greeks made ballots of these cast-offs from the potter 's wheel and voted to exile hated politicians ; thus the word ostracize ) . The pottery was used in Egypt because papyrus was expensive besides being a state of monopoly . In the year 1343 , the great pyramids at Giza were already ancient monuments , built in 2500 B.C. , and Tutankhamun must have seen them many times , gleaming in the sun like geometric shapes of moonlight for those days they were covered with alabaster . Among the other splendors Tutankhamun saw were gold-plated columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard of a pair of obelisks made of the alloy electrum , 75 percent gold , 22 percent silver and 3 percent copper which had a combined weight of 166,650 pounds and were carried off in the sack of Thebes . The coffin of the king is solid 22-carat gold and weighs 2,448 pounds . Tutankhamun was a minor figure in Egyptian history , a man who came to the throne when he was nine and died probably at eighteen , perhaps , pathologists think , from damage to the head at the hand of an assassin . Everything about the contents of the tomb speaks of haste and extravagance . The corpse itself , due to too lavish application of costly preserving fluids and unguents , had deteriorated . Despite the tomb 's being the most fabulous buried treasure ever uncached , it had already been pillaged two times and perhaps more . These intrusions into what the king and his mourners believe was eternity took place shortly after the interment of the young king and the two tiny coffins bearing the bodies of either stillborn children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which the cycle of life in the underworld would not be complete . The embalming of the pharaoh 's body took seventy days , seventy days of ritual and resourcefulness , for most of the splendors of the tomb were created in this short period . The tomb itself was hastily converted from a commoner 's grave to receive its royal body . The four tiny rooms were crammed with thousands of objects . It took Howard Carter , the painstaking and faithful archaeologist , six years to remove them from the tomb . So closely were the chariots , chairs , chests , lamps , jars , games , scepters , stools , boats , gods and goddesses , jewels , food , figures , fans , beds , bows , crooks , flails , papyrus , pens , musical instruments , baskets , vases , oars , daggers , canopic vessels , boxes , flowers and linens packed that Carter wrote , " So crowded were they that it was a matter of extreme difficulty to move one without running serious risk of damaging others . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent five years in the desert searching for Tutankhamun , had endured pests and plagues , cobras , mosquitoes , fever , sand and heat that caramelized around a hundred degrees for weeks , and the thefts of valuable artifacts by workmen and laborers and even some officials of the government . Through his ordeals , George Herbert , Earl of Carnarvon , Carter 's patron , an Englishman whose failed health had sent him to Egypt , supported him , quavering only in the final season , when the approximate half million dollars spent on the expedition began to weigh heavily on the lack of discovery . But in the final season Carter was finally to unearth the treasure that would put all other excavations in the shade . For although the workmanship of Tutankhamun 's tomb  --  the wall paintings and the details of the jewelry and mummiforms  --  are not as fine or as grand as those in other funerary temples in Egypt , the young king 's tomb virtually is the only royal Egyptian tomb to have been discovered with its contents intact . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever lived through , " Carter said later . " Darkness and blank space , as far as an iron testing rod could reach , showed that whatever lay beyond was empty , " he went on . " Widening the hole a little , I inserted the candle and peered in .. .. At first I could see nothing , the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker , but presently , as my eyes grew accustomed to the light , details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist , strange animals , statues , and gold  --  everywhere the glint of gold . " For the moment  --  an eternity it must have seemed to the others standing by  --  I was struck dumb with amazement , and when Lord Carnarvon , unable to stand the suspense any longer , inquired anxiously , Can you see anything ? ' it was all I could do to get out the words , ' Yes , wonderful things . .. . ' " The Earl gave his view in the London Times of December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , or wall , bearing the same seals as the former one ( the stamp of the officials of the Valley of the Kings whose duty it was to guard the tombs against grave robbers ) . I asked Mr. Carter to take out a few stones and have a look in . After a few minutes this was done . He pushed his head partly into the aperture . With the help of a candle , he could dimly discern what was inside . A long silence followed , until I said , I fear in somewhat trembling tones , ' Well , what is it ? ' There are some marvelous objects here , ' was the welcome reply . Having given up my place to my daughter , I myself went to the hole and I could with difficulty restrain my excitement . . . . We enlarged the hole and Mr. Carter managed to scramble in  --  the chamber is sunk two feet below the bottom passage  --  and then , as he moved around with a candle , we knew we had found something absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the candle , a wonderful sight was exposed to our excited eyes ... The first thing that one noticed against the wall facing the door were three gigantic carved gilt wood beds , the ends of the beds having carved heads . Beneath the central couch were heaped twenty or thirty white wooden boxes containing mummified legs of mutton , ducks , geese , venison , and the like .. .. Beneath another bed was the throne of the king .... We found four chariot bodies in gilt wood inlaid with semiprecious stones . The wheels are in a heap on one side , while the poles are stacked against the wall .. . . At the northern end are two life-sized portrait statues of the king in bituminized wood . On his brow is the crown of Egypt ; around his neck is the gilt collar , emblem of royalty ; he is clad in the shenti , a sort of stiff kilt . In one hand he holds a long gilt stick ; in the other a gilt mace . .. . Between the two statues we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wall we shall come to the funerary chamber of King Tutankhamun . " In one long box , Lord Carnarvon found an armful of roses , still bearing faint ' traces of color after 3,000 years . Theodore Davis , an American archaeologist who had made significant finds in the early years of the century , spoke of uncovering an alabaster vase filled with honey , still liquid and sweet , and of shooing a wasp away from the precious contents , the insect unmindful of the honey 's having lain there for thirty-two centuries . Davis also wrote some years before Carter 's discovery , " I fear the Valley of the Kings is exhausted . " Howard Carter was a bachelor , forty-nine at the time of his great discovery . From the south of England ( Norfolk ) , he had learned drawing from his father and grandfather who were animal painters , followers of the great Landseer , Queen Victoria 's favorite artist . Carter went to Egypt in 1890 as a draftsman with the Egyptian Exploration Fund . He was seventeen . For six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures and inscriptions at the temple of Queen Hatshepsut near ancient Thebes . Then , as an inspector of Egypt 's antiquities department he discovered the tombs of Hatshepsut and King Thutmose IV in 1902 . Pertinacity and a shrewd judgment of slender evidence inspired Carter to continue digging when most excavators would have abandoned the project . Great manual skill , immense patience , superlative draftsmanship rendered his work analytically perfect . He seemed always able to control himself . When , after years of searching , he had narrowed his ground to a small triangle in the Valley of the Kings , a triangle beneath the tomb of Ramesses VI where , because of the rubble excavated from Ramesses ' tomb , other excavators had neglected to dig , he abandoned none of his usual systematic attention to detail . When his workmen uncovered steps leading to what he hoped was the tomb , he had the passages filled in again with rubble and sent the following telegram to his patron : " At last have made wonderful discovery in valley ; a magnificent tomb with seals intact ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his daughter , Lady Evelyn Herbert , set out at once , going by train to Marseilles and then by ship to Alexandria and train to Cairo , and finally to Luxor where they were ferried across the Nile to donkeys for the few miles across the desert to Carter 's brick house outside the entrance to the necropolis . Carter was to show his patience again in the opening of the sarcophagus itself . Two years went by before he had removed enough of the treasures in the antechamber and the rooms he called the annex and the treasury to have sufficient space to Iift the stone of the massive sarcophagus . Inside the burial chamber were four golden shrines and within the sarcophagus three mummiform coffins . A foot of space on all sides of the shrine and three above barely gave Carter room to set up his winch and tackle . Scarcely a finger 's width separated the coffins , yet each was shrouded in fine red linen and the pharaoh 's crown , the famed twin symbol of the vulture and cobra , signifying the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were garlanded with sweet olive flowers and blue lotus petals . Carter could distinguish their color though the scent had long vanished . Finally an extraordinary gold death mask covered the face of the young king , and proved , when the mummy itself was revealed , to be a striking likeness of Tutankhamun with his slightly narrow eyes , sensuous lips and the elongated skull which seemed to have been a characteristic of the royal family . The king 's fingers were covered in finely modeled gold with the nails and first joints picked out in detail . The extravagant pouring of costly unguents onto the mummy and over the linen bandages , far from preserving the corpse , had had the opposite effect , so that only the parts of the body protected by the gold collar and sheaths were saved . When the robbers entered the tomb those three thousand years ago ( the dates are fairly easy to ascertain since the doors had been resealed and officials of the necropolis had stamped the wet mortar with their seals and the cartouche of Tutankhamun ) , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haste that they were able to steal only small portable items . The king 's body itself had not been touched . The thieves had concentrated mainly on removing the Continued on page 106 costly oils from the alabaster jars and lamps and small items of gold jewelry . So great was the haste of the burglars that they apparently dropped several of the gold earrings and small figurines , along with some of their sacks for carrying away loot , in their rush to get out of the tomb . The king 's body was thick with gold and jeweled treasures tucked between the bandages applied by the embalmer . One hundred forty-three precious objects in an excellent state of preservation were recovered from the mummy . Gold finger-stalls , sandals , gold rings , necklaces , bracelets , diadems , daggers , pendants , pectorals and amulets adorned the body , which had been completely shaven . Tutankhamun 's head was prepared for burial in a different manner from those of most of the other sovereigns excavated in Egypt . Those other great kings of the Nile were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head there was only a small skull cap of sheer linen woven with gold filigree and a terra cotta bandeau on his brow from which rose four sacred cobras , their bodies entwined in a pattern on the top of the king 's s kull . One theory to explain the different embalming is that the king was buried as a god . Tutankhamun had been instrumental in restoring the worship of Amun ( the king of the gods , later portrayed by the Greeks as Zeus ) . Tutankhamun 's name had been Tutankhaten ( Living image of Aten ) , but as he embraced the old religion , he changed his name to Tutan khamun . His accomplishments as king seem to have been few . He enlarged the temples of Amun at Karnak and Luxor and was succeeded briefly by Ay , described as Father of the God , indicating that he was probably of a strong military family and kin to the royal family , valued as an advisor . Ay was followed after four years by Horemheb , one of Tutankhamun 's generals , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase the name of Tutankhamun from the face of the earth , obliterating his head on statues , pounding his temples to dust , carrying off building blocks to be used on his own constructions and sanding Tutankhamun 's name wherever it appeared on stone . In the Louvre , there is a statue of Amun with Tutankhamun standing in front of him , protected by the god . The king 's head has been lopped off and the hieroglyphics on the back of the figures have had the cartouches bearing the king 's name obliterated . General Horemheb partially succeeded in losing the name of Tutankhamun to history , but in death the king lives more magnificently perhaps than he did in life . The charming figures of Tutankhamun with his lissome queen , Ankhesenamun , who may Living in the second half of the twentieth century , I realized , confers no automatic protection against unwise or even dangerous drugs and methods .

Suppose I stopped taking aspirin and phenylbutazone ? What about the pain ? The bones in my spine and practically every joint in my body felt as though I had been run over by a truck . I knew that pain could be affected by attitudes . Most people become panicky about almost any pain . On all sides they have been so bombarded by advertisements about pain that they take this or that analgesic at the slightest sign of an ache . They are largely illiterate about pain and so are seldom able to deal with it rationally . Pain is part of the body 's magic . It is the way the body transmits a sign to the brain that something is wrong . Leprous patients pray for the sensation of pain . What makes leprosy such a terrible disease is that the victim usually feels no pain when his extremities are being injured . He loses his fingers or toes because he receives no warning signal that he is being injured .

There was also the problem of the severe inflammation . If we dispensed with the aspirin , how would we combat the inflammation ? I recalled having read in the medical journals about the usefulness of ascorbic acid in combating a wide number of illnesses  --  all the way from bronchitis to some types of heart disease . Could n't it also combat inflammation ? Did vitamin C act directly , or did it serve as a starter for the body 's endocrine system  --  in particular , the adrenal glands ? Was it possible , I asked myself , that ascorbic acid had a vital role to play in " feeding " the adrenal glands ? I had read in the medical press that vitamin C helps to oxygenate the blood . If inadequate or impaired oxygenation was a factor in collagen breakdown , could n't this circumstance be another argument for ascorbic acid ?
