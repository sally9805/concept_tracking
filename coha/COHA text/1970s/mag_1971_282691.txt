All of Harold Pinter 's plays can be viewed as attempts to write the same play . Each new work appears to be another approximation of some Platonic ideal in which Pinter yearns finally to reduce a few characteristic themes and methods to their purest state , finally to narrow his focus to a vision of life in its quiddity . In these terms , Old Times , which opened last week in London , may be his nearest miss yet . <P> The plot encapsulates the basic Pinter situation . Two people are together , in this case a documentary film maker and his wife of 20 years , who live in a remote farmhouse . They are joined by a third person who has ties to the past of one of them-a woman with whom the wife lived during her days as a secretary in London . As usual with Pinter , the surface is unremittingly mundane . Coffee is poured , snatches of old songs are sung , memories are exchanged . Also as usual , the action is punctuated by pregnant pauses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hinted at : the lingering spell of the visitor 's lesbian attachment to the wife , the husband 's sense of being threatened by the woman 's arrival , the wife 's sublime and ultimately frightening impassivity before love . <P> Calculated Precisely . All of this may strike some playgoers as merely another Pinter puzzle , and a rather dehydrated one at that . But in fact it is a virtuoso display of how subtle , gripping and revealing a drama can be , J fashioned from such spare materials . Fixed with Pinter 's almost hallucinatory concentration and clarity , every word and gesture has its measured weight and effect . The climaxes are restrained , yet so precisely calculated-as when the two women suddenly lapse into speaking with each other as if they were roommates again-that the impact can be shattering . <P> Pinter is not out to anatomize nostalgia or even to strip it naked , but to show how people use memories as weapons . The woman visitor and the husband vie with each other to possess the wife by possessing her past . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " casting each other in roles to suit their own purposes . Did the woman or the husband introduce the wife to the movie Odd Man Out ! Did the husband once meet the woman in a pub and go to a party with her where he gazed up her skirt ? The answers do not matter , only the assertions . " There are some things one remembers even though they may never have happened , " says the woman . " There are things I remember which may never have happened , but as I recall them , so they take place . " <P> Victorious But Frustrated . Directed by Peter Hall and designed by John Bury , the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production is impeccable . Vivien Merchant ( Mrs. Harold Pinter ) , who is to Pinter 's plays what Clara Schumann was to her husband 's music , plays the woman with a mixture of hauteur and girlish romanticism . She makes the character both menacing and slightly spurious . Colin Blakely is blessedly funny and touching as the bluff husband whose male pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually frustrated . In the role of the mysterious wife , Dorothy Tutin catches the unconscious cruelty of an indifference that can take anything but give nothing .
