 | Tonight , and for the past fortnight , the room was not dominated by its furnishings , but by all the kind , caring , and even curious people who packed into the spacious room and spilled out into the courtyard . From her place on the stairs , Martha could see the activity which came and went in small explosions of movement . She was fascinated by the fact that while the room was simply teeming with people , they all moved and breathed in a haunting sort of way . They clustered about in small groups , and for the most part , their talk was a low rumbling sound . Yet every once in a while , as it was right at that moment , they fell absolutely silent . They looked up and waited , as if her appearance on the stairs meant she would make an announcement or give them some new news . To her it felt a little like she had lost all or part of her hearing , and she thought , It 's uncanny . So many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change and their expectant , upturned faces waited for her , Martha shook her head no , and they fell back to their small groups . The low murmuring began once more . The villagers and even friends from Jerusalem had begun gathering two days ago when this crisis had emerged , and they had seemed to sense that this time it was different  --  perhaps , the last . By one wall lamp she could see a cluster of old men . Great patriarchs of the faith , she smiled . And then she thought how dear it was of them to be there . They had been her father 's friends , and they stood , together , in what looked like a special tribute to her dead father 's memory . Martha 's thoughts were interrupted because she found it suddenly difficult to swallow the lump of grief which always seemed to form when she thought of her father . She missed him even yet , but quickly she reminded herself it had been eighteen winters and eighteen summers since he had gone . So she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do much for her . When she recognized the dark robes and full white beard of Jacob Ben Nathan , that did n't help much either . Aye , she thought , and a flood of memories engulfed her . How  | he loved my father ! She remembered how old Jacob had laughed and argued with her father in a most Jewish way , and the recollection made her relax her shoulders just a bit in spite of the night . But the lump grew larger in her throat . She knew everyone milling quietly around in the huge hall below her , because her little village of Bethany was large enough to be interesting , far enough away from the bustling city of Jerusalem to be restful , and yet was small enough to cover details such as names , new babies , and deaths . The homes themselves were scattered over the steep hills like small white jewels surrounded by the lush green velvet of cypress , pine , and palm trees . Of Bethany 's forty-nine houses , one dominated the main hill with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one calls this place the house of Josiah Ben Jochanan . It is always called " Martha 's House . " She wondered what her father would have thought of that . Tonight the great house was filled with at least one person from each of the neighboring houses . While most came out of love , Martha suspected a few came ( as they always did ) just to watch the goings and comings of Bethany 's most affluent household . Standing here and there beside the groups of men were the womenfolk of Bethany , their veils covering their bowed heads . A quick , general glance confirmed what she already suspected , and disappointment edged itself deeper into her frown . Her sister 's beautiful face was not among the faces below , and Martha 's own face tightened with the frustration . In the next instant , she forgot about her sister , Mary , because she found Hannah , and the sight of her melted away some of the disappointment . Hannah was the widow who lived one house to the west . Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired Hannah 's abundant strength and silent courage . She had been able to pick out Hannah because her face was turned upward and wet with tears . The light from the nearest hanging lamp sparkled on her face and highlighted her aged beauty . Her mouth , as Martha knew it would be , was forming silent , prayerful words of supplication.  | " Blessed art thou , dear Hannah , " Martha sighed . They were all there ; her friends , neighbors , kinfolk , and servants , and that they were there because of her brother 's time of dying made their presence very sweet . She was touched by the whole scene and typically she had no idea how to handle the rush of love rising urgently within her . She was always at a loss when coping with her unseen emotions . She turned her attention once again to the movements of the crowd . " Yes , almost everyone seems to be here except for Mary , " she sighed . Weaving in and out of little knots of people , like the trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . They worked their way through everyone , but even in their urgent rushing they were curiously still . Their bare feet flew noiselessly over the carpets , stone floors , and up and down the steps . Martha spotted vivacious Deborah taking a small lamp to be refilled with oil , but she could see that the usual sparkle of Deborah 's plain face was gone , and it was expressionless and pale . Martha saw Leah , another servant girl , and her face  --  in direct contrast to Deborah 's  --  was beautiful , but set and solemn as if it had been hewn out of polished marble . The two girls passed each other without a word or a glance . Martha silently murmured her thanks to them and marveled at their endurance and strength . Whether it was water jars balancing delicately on their heads , or clean linen held aloft in their hands , they seemed to move determinedly and effortlessly through the maze of people , steps , and corridors . In spite of her weariness and the horror which was spending itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw Tabitha pass by Deborah and Leah as if they had been standing stone-still . Tiny , amazing Tabitha , she said to herself . Your name means " gazelle , " and whoever named you called you rightly . Tabitha did indeed move with the speed and grace of a young , healthy doe . In fact , she outran , outworked , and outscrubbed just about everyone , Martha recalled . The little mite of a girl passed Martha on the steps with no words but quick understanding glances . There it was again  --  the low murmuring or the eerie quietness .  | It was what had stopped her on her way in the first place . It was all so strange . This huge , great hall was filled with people keeping their vigil during the night 's deathwatch ; yet everything was happening with so little noise . Once in a while she could hear the yipping of a hyena or jackal from the surrounding hills , but apart from that and the occasional moaning from upstairs , the silence fitted down over the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an involuntary shiver , smoothed some damp hair out of her eyes with her forearm , and realizing how time had passed , she sternly took herself to task for being on the stairs so long . Where is Mary ? again she questioned . She should be up there with him . Even if he is sleeping , he needs her presence . Where has she been all night ? It was as if she had vanished with the first night 's wind . Martha breathed in a breath of the hot , close air and resolved firmly , as she knew she had to , to continue her tasks of the night , with or without Mary . Briskly she moved down the steps . When she reached the main floor , everyone wordlessly parted like the Red Sea had done for Moses , and she moved straight and tall through the midst of them . She was striding past their concerned , worried faces and would have reached the cooking area without a word to anyone had it not been for the constraining arm of Rabbi Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Lazarus ? " he whispered , motioning with his head towards the stairs . She became a little vexed with him for detaining her , because she felt she 'd already idled away far too much time . Besides , she had left Lazarus alone because he was resting , so now she was anxious to get back . However , she showed no impatience , because she was obliged to respect him and the sadness clinging to his words was warm and genuine . Martha also knew the rabbi was not there tonight to gossip outside the synagogue or down in the town 's small marketplace in the morning . He was there because he loved Lazarus . In fact , she mumbled to herself with some resignation , does n't everyone love my brother ? Sickly and pale as he was , even from his childhood , Lazarus  | had somehow managed to put everyone at ease about his obvious illness , and in what seemed like only moments , he forged lifelong friendships with family and friends alike . That she could never understand , but long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends as one of her brother 's gifts . A gift she did not have . " Now , Rabbi , " she faced him directly and shifted her offensively sour clothes to her hip away from his face . " You know our God has blessed Lazarus with many gifts . However , good health has not exactly been one of them . My good brother has been sick for all of his thirty years here in our house , and we have seen him like this before . Please take heart . I 'm just sure he will come through even this . " Seeing that her words had not convinced him completely , she spoke up , a trifle sharply , " You seem to be forgetting , dear Rabbi , I am no novice in the techniques of healing . " Hostility , like a small creature , ran through her statement , and the rabbi caught it instantly . He hastily tried to prove his loyalty to her and her father 's house by countering , " Oh , my dear child , I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . The whole of Bethany knows and gratefully acknowledges your healing hands . " Then his voice faltered a bit , but he continued . " It 's just that this time . . . this time the crisis is so prolonged . Lazarus took to his pallet last autumn . I remember it well because it was right after the Feast of Tabernacles , and , dear Martha , he is still there . In fact , his condition has worsened , and well , " he finished lamely , " you know it 's almost spring , and he 's no better . " I do n't need a reminder about my brother or the seasons ! Her thoughts bristled within her . She managed to quell the rising rebellion inside her and gave the rabbi a tight smile . Respectfully she said , " He will survive . You 'll see . " She hoped her words had rung of experienced confidence , but the shaking of the old rabbi 's head told her she had not been very successful . Cautiously he leaned closer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Martha wondered if , in her whole lifetime , she had ever heard Rabbi Ben Isaiah ask for permission to make a suggestion . She was sure she had n't . " By all means , honored teacher , " she said . As if I could stop you , she thought . For an instant a small smile played about her mouth . " Your friend Jesus has healed so many . I was wondering if you had considered asking for his intervention . " He finished with his hands piously folded together near the top of his chest . Martha almost laughed out loud . There stood her dear , old , trusted rabbi suggesting she call Jesus , while he himself had publicly and privately said , " I am one rabbi who will have to have the carpenter 's claims proven beyond any doubt before I believe he is who he says he is . " " Why , Rabbi Ben Isaiah , are you changing your mind about the man who walks among us humbly , speaking as no other ruler , leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tugged at his beard . That Martha is as smart as three quick men all rolled together , his thoughts pronounced . " I only meant he is your friend , and his reputation for healing grows larger each day . I would have thought you would have asked him to heal Lazarus long before this . " Now she was getting annoyed , and with the smallest speck of respect in her tone , she said , " Rabbi , it is precisely because he is our friend that we have never taken advantage of him in Lazarus 's behalf . We have enjoyed him in our home , but Lazarus himself has always cautioned us against petitioning him . Now , forgive me , but I have spent far too long away from my duties . " The rabbi , understanding more about people than she did in those moments , pretended not to notice her tone of voice , but it was an awkward time for both of them . Martha knew her tongue was too outspoken , especially for a woman , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was grateful for the sputtering of a lamp behind him , and with one quick gesture she signaled passing Deborah to replenish the oil . The girl caught the look and nodded affirmatively.  | As Martha bolted from the great hall , the rabbi tugged on his beard and muttered , " That one never misses a thing . " Martha constantly nettled the rabbi with her efficiency , her planning , and her tongue , which could be sharper than a double-edged sword , but he had to admire her good heart and the way she got things done . My , how proud Josiah would have been of his Martha tonight , he chuckled and amended his thinking to include Lazarus and Mary . All of them are fine children , and they would make any father 's heart beat with pride , he mused as he watched her go . He had often observed and compared Martha 's plain features to Mary 's beauty , but he had to admit that while Mary was startlingly beautiful with her flame red hair and luminous blue eyes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper way . Yes , he repeated to himself , Josiah would be proud . Breaking away from the rabbi and the others , Martha finally reached the large cooking area . She was almost swallowed into a sea of frenzied activity . The room with its whitewashed walls , its hanging lamps , cupboards , tables , and baskets of lentils and beans was bursting with human bodies . Everyone was working on their appointed tasks : bringing in the filled water pots , taking soiled linen outside to be washed , or merely standing alert for her directions . Without counting , Martha knew for certain that no servant or slave was in his bed taking his ease . They were all there , present and accounted for . They , too , loved Master Lazarus . Their obvious show of love made her frustration with Mary 's absences grow larger . They must all know he 's dying , she thought . Because she knew it too , the hard knot which had lain heavily in her abdomen for weeks slowly , but surely , burned with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have registered her pain when Naomi , laying her leathery , spotted hand on her arm , asked , " Are you ailing , too ? " " No , I am not ill , and you must not worry , Naomi . In fact , you should be on your pallet , for you will need your rest come the dawn . " The old woman did not leave but sat down on the nearest low  | stool . " I can not sleep , " she said simply . Her tears began to flow down her face . The creases and lines made tiny riverbeds for the tears , and she made no attempt to stop the flow or dry up the source . " Will Lazarus . . . ? " Unable to pronounce the word die , she broke off , leaning her head against the wall . The flow of tears turned the unchecked streams into rivers of salty water , and she was powerless to stop it . Grimly she waited for Martha 's answer . Naomi was not only the oldest woman servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . It was Martha who oversaw each detail that transpired in the household . She had taken over the responsibility years ago , but Naomi had been there first . Martha , still holding her linens , squatted down beside the white-haired woman and recalled how dear old Naomi had lovingly taken care of all of them when they were little . She had been , in effect , a second mother even though no blood ties connected them . Josiah Ben Jochanan and his lovely Galilean wife , Rachel , had rejoiced thirty-two years ago at the birth of their firstborn  --  a strong , husky , and surprisingly large baby girl . Jointly they agreed to name her Martha . It was an appropriate and even prophetic name for it means " lady " or " mistress of the house . " Two years later the same loving union gave them a son . That he was small and exceedingly frail was of no consequence to them , because he was the product of their love . Three years passed , and their third child was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair in skin coloring , with flaming red hair , as Martha was ivory skinned and dark raven haired . But with her birth came the first real sadness for the family of Josiah Ben Jochanan . Only moments after Rachel had glimpsed the bright , exquisite face of her newest daughter , she died in Josiah 's arms with Naomi clutching the tiny babe . Later Josiah , remembering a loving conversation whispered weeks before her death , named the infant Mary , as Rachel had wished .  | The day of Mary 's birth , Naomi had inherited instant motherhood to two children and one baby . She had done her job with loving devotion , and even after her fingers lost their quickness and were bent and rigid , she continued to live there and to love each of them . However , Martha had suspected , with no rancor whatsoever , that it had always been Lazarus who had captured most strongly the old woman 's heart . Suddenly , the stench from the linen jolted Martha back into the night , and quickly she dropped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees beside Naomi 's stool , Martha crisply said , " Naomi , look at me . " Martha had the vexing ability to speak , command , and delegate authority much like a Roman centurion . It was quite noticeable that when she spoke , most people tended to look and listen . So it was at that moment . However , Naomi kept her hands clamped over her mouth as though she was afraid a cry might escape and shatter the deep stillness in the house . Without taking her hands away , she dutifully looked into Martha 's deep , brown eyes . " Are you listening ? " Martha 's tone was gentle , but intense . She waited for the woman 's nod and then continued . " Now , " here she evenly measured out her words . " I want you to remember how many times in the past year you have seen this fiery fever and weakness come upon Lazarus and take its toll of him . Remember , too , that between God , you , and me , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naomi dropped her hands from her face and lifted the corner of her skirt to dry her face . She wiped her cheeks and slowly nodded her head in agreement . For just a second there was a glimmer of relief on her face , but it vanished quickly as she blurted out , " But , Mistress Martha , never have these old eyes beheld his sickness so strong or for so long . This time the fire in his body and the issue of blood that streams from him is more . . . more than ever in the past . " Ignoring the truth of Naomi 's statement , Martha stubbornly went on . " Believe me , it will be as before . You 'll see . We will bring him through . We shall . "  | " But it is all so different this time , " Naomi wailed . Then , as if she had a sudden inspirational solution , she touched Martha 's shoulder and whispered , " Will you send for him ? " Martha pretended ignorance to gain time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My dear Martha , you know who I mean . " Wearily , Martha uttered , " I 'm sorry , Naomi . I do n't have time to go into this with you , but , no , I am not going to send word to Jesus . " She stood up now , tall and authoritative before the old woman . Naomi looked up and pleaded , " But he loves you and all of this household . Has he not called this place his house of renewal ' ? If he knew of Lazarus 's terrible state , he would willingly come . " Then , to reinforce her own thoughts , she added brightly , " And once here , he would make everything alright . " Martha 's voice , heavy with extreme fatigue and edged with anger , said a determined , " No . " " But , " Naomi implored . " No ! " And this time it was thundered rather than spoken . As soon as she had said it , Martha was sorry for her outburst . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologized , and said , " It 's just that Jesus has troubles of his own . Why should he take on ours , too ? " Naomi was barely listening , but Martha continued . " He has told us and all his men that he will be rejected and shunned by the elect of the priesthood , elders , and scribes alike . The last time we saw Peter , he told us Jesus had even predicted his own death . I did not really believe that he would go that far , but then only a few days ago I was told by Uncle Tobias that Jesus narrowly escaped being stoned to death in the city . Can you see , Naomi ? I can not ask him to come when his own circumstances are so dangerously fragile . " Martha was too tired to go into all the frightening rumors she had heard . She wondered if , even for Lazarus , she had the right to ask Jesus to risk his life in coming to Bethany . She would have said more , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area was intently listening . All were soaking up her words like sponges . The sight of them was like a finger snapping loudly in her  | head , forcing her back into reality , and quickly she jumped up , springing into immediate action like an arrow shot from a strong bow . " You , Joseph , " she directed . " I have run out of clean wet cloths for his fever . See if any are ready yet from the washing trough . " Then , turning , she said , " Leah , go with him and bring as many as you can . Tabitha , I have not seen my sister since dark . Please find her and tell her to come upstairs . Be your usual quick self . " Her tone softened , and she was about to continue setting everything in a more orderly way when the hushed night air was slashed in two by a long , piercing scream . Everyone became a solid statue , as if they were made of stone , and held their positions . The scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thick , long skirts in one hand and pushing everyone out of the way with the other , bounded out past horrified people in the main room . She took the steps two at a time to the chamber upstairs . She could hear the clamoring questions of the people below , and it sounded like a lion roaring in the distance . Naomi , finding speed from some bygone year of her youth , followed closely behind in a frantic scramble , and both women came to an abrupt halt in the doorway of Lazarus 's room . The young girl just inside the doorway , with the broken water vessel at her feet , was still screaming . In one quick gesture , Martha clamped her hand over the girl 's mouth and hissed , " Deborah , stop it ! That 's enough ! " Promptly it silenced her , but the terror was still in the girl 's large , wide-open , brown eyes . For a moment Martha matched Deborah 's stare with a meaningful glare , and when she had the situation under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horror which had evoked the girl 's hysteria . Blood was everywhere . Martha had never seen so much . Even when she had brought forth the most complicated birthing of babies as a midwife , she had not seen such a flow of blood . Naomi clutched the doorpost and endlessly sobbed , " My God , my God . " Martha picked her way through the broken pottery , her sandais  | slipping in the mixture of spilled water and discharged blood , and slowly , like in a bad dream , she made her way over to his pallet . The thick hem of her dress soaked up the grim liquid and got heavy with it before she reached him . Her pace towards him seemed to take forever . Where is all this coming from ? she puzzled . How could one emaciated , sick man spill out so much of life and so quickly ? Her thoughts raced a hundred times faster than her feet . She had not been gone that long , she reasoned to herself . It was only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheeks had been flushed and reddened and he had been burning to touch , but when she had asked how he felt , he had answered with a slight affirmative nod of his head . He had even managed a flicker of a smile . Thus she had left him unattended , not pleased with progress , but satisfied with circumstances . Now this ! She despaired as she looked down on his death white face . He breathed a few short gasps as she watched , then lay still , only to startle her a second later with more quick intakes of air . With each movement of his chest , she expected the end . But after a few minutes of watching , she recalled some of the dying people she had seen , who breathed in this strange way for days ( once even for a week ) before dying . " Naomi ! " she called . " This is not the time for sobbing but for scrubbing . Help me clean him up and set this room in order . " Naomi stopped her moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . " Martha made her way over to the doorway and impatiently said , " He has no reason to be alive , but he is . As long as there is a flicker of life in his body , I shall see to his needs . Now , move ! " For the better part of two hours they all washed , soaked up the mess , and stole anxious glances at the pale shell of a man . Finally everything was as before except , of course , for Lazarus . He was on the knife-edge of his life , and when Martha looked on him , she began to prepare herself for his death morning . She had dearly paid for her mistake of leaving him unattended ;  | so she began to prepare to stay by his side until it was over . However , both Naomi and Leah asked if they could watch him and relieve her for a few hours . Martha , fatigued beyond belief and touched by their caring love , wearily agreed and left the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs and told the still-waiting friends that Lazarus seemed to be resting and they should go to their homes . She promised to send immediate word should his condition change . Reluctantly , they began to leave , but two old women and one man refused to abandon their deathwatch . She tried reasoning with them , but her tongue was thick with fatigue , and she lost her ability to give sense to her words . In the end , she let them stay . Martha tended the lamps , put out the fires in the big ones , and left several small ones burning , and murmured her good night to the solemn figures sitting in the hall . She then checked the cooking area and back entrances to be sure that every one of the household had gone to his pallet . Exhausted of spirit and wearied beyond physical endurance , she forced herself up the inner staircase once more . Once she reached the upper floor , she merely put her head inside the doorway and watched his uneven breathing sequence until she was satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , nodded , and gestured toward the roof . They understood and settled down to their vigil . When she left them , she moved to an outside doorway and eventually wound her way up on an outside staircase to the upper roof . How long have I been down there ? she wondered , and then she remembered , only two days and two nights . But somehow this had been so different . The room below her had been stifling hot and rancid with the smell of dying . It is good to be up here , she thought as she reached the top step of the narrow stairway which led to the roof . But never had she been so drained .  | WHEN she stepped out on to the roof , the moon was full , and everything was bathed and shimmering in its delicate , silvery light . Bethany 's night wind , which always kissed the earth and the whitewashed houses with its coolness each evening , was gently perfuming the air with various fragrances . The majestic scent of cedar , cypress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroma of spring flowers which had just burst into splashes of color in the gardens below and the hills beyond . The only sounds up there now were the songs of the crickets and other small creatures who were performing their simple musical patterns out in their hillside amphitheater . Bordering the large roof on three sides were low stout walls , whitewashed and gleaming in the moon 's illumination . The long back side of the roof supported a narrow third-level room . Martha used it for storing extra supplies and foodstuffs , but sometimes , when they had a houseful of guests in the height of the summer 's heat and dryness , she cleaned it out and used it for cool sleeping quarters . At one end attached to the front of this room was a large fringed canopy . It was held out from the walls by three sturdy wooden poles . During the day its shade provided a lonely respite from the sun 's searing rays , but at night it provided a dark , rather private place for contemplation . Scattered over the rooftop itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets . Because it was spring , the trays were empty now , but they were stained and fragrant with the juice  | from the last harvest of figs , grapes , and apricots . Here and there , in the midst of the baskets and trays , stood some gracefully designed pottery storage jars . Up on the wall , Martha had started small fruit trees by planting them in little wooden tubs . They stood like miniature sentries around the wall and gently bent with the breeze . The moon 's light was so bright that the darkest place on the roof was the area under the canvas canopy , but all of it escaped Martha . None of the night 's sounds , sights , or even the roof 's lone occupant was seen by the fatigued woman . Almost as if she were in a trance , Martha moved across the expansive roof , picked her way around some large jars , and crumpled down on the edge of the roof wall just in front of the canopied area . Her feelings were unreal as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her body was there , but she could n't feel anything . Her eyes were open , but she saw nothing . She spoke and was unaware that her words were being heard . " I feel like a wilted tamarisk blossom , " she sighed . She could n't remember being so tired . Even my bones are tired , she realized . The skin over her cheekbones seemed stretched to its limit , and her head was persistently pounding with pain . She was gray with fatigue , but she resolved anew that she would not give in . " I 'll hold out , " she said aloud , but she was n't sure how . Suddenly she blurted out , " My God , have You abandoned me ? Lazarus is dying . I 've done all I could do . No , I 've done more than anyone . Will You snatch him away , too ? " Her thoughts became jagged , rough spoken utterances . Had she been given to cursing ( as the widow woman who lived in the small cave on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenities to the whole of Bethany . Yes , she thought , even to the smallest star on the edge of the darkest part of the night . However , she could n't ignore the coolness of the night on the roof , and it soothed her , but her thoughts continued to pour out of her as if her soul were a broken vessel . " Like a thief in the night , You have stolen my mother , father , even my bridegroom . And now , again in the night , are You stealing my brother , too ? "  | Some of what she said and felt got through to her , because she found herself a bit shocked at what she had voiced . Never , ever , had she vocalized her frustrations about God 's will to anyone , much less to God ! Yet the words continued to drain out of her heart . " I do not begin to see the wisdom of all this . He suffers wordlessly ; yet he continues to suffer . His pain is more than I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dagger through me . Dear God , I have seen so much of sickness and death . Must I see even more ? " For once Martha let her hot , stinging tears stream down her face . The rigidness seemed to melt out of her neck and spine , and as the tears were released , she bent over and laid her head in her arms on her knees . Her sobbing stabbed the night with sound . She did not know how long she sat like that or whether it was the cry or the cool wind which refreshed her , but slowly she felt a little better . She eased herself down off the wall and sat on the rooftop itself . An early spring rain had patted down the earth , and the cool , moist air seemed to slow her breathing and anger . Leaning with her back braced by the wall , she said aloud of past memories , " You know , my Lord , I do n't ever remember being alive without the sword of death hanging over my head . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sobbing could be heard in the farthest corner of their majestic stone house . Lazarus , only three years old at the time , knew only by his father 's wailing that something was terribly wrong . He stayed on his pallet with Naomi bending over him , doing her best to calm his fears . Martha , at five , knew better . She was already a serious child by nature , and her mother 's death made her even more somber . Their neighbor Hannah had discovered Martha standing stoically in the hall outside Rachel 's room . She had picked the little girl up , held her on her broad lap , and sang soft little songs to her . But it was to no avail . Martha 's young mind sensed that because of the night 's events , everything would be changed . The morning after her mother died , Martha solemnly watched  | as the women bathed and prepared the body for burial in the family sepulcher . Had they seen her , she would not have been allowed to stay . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied , that no one caught sight of her . Some would say later of the day that it was the moment when a five-year-old girl grew into womanhood . It was true . For Martha seemed , from that day forward , to accept death and dying , and in small ways she began to carry out a few adult responsibilities . Overnight she became the self-appointed guardian and mother to both her brother and infant sister , almost totally ignoring Naomi 's mothering efforts . She interrupted her recollections by voicing out loud , " Yes , all this time I 've taken my mother 's place and for the last eighteen years even my father 's position . " " Mother , " she said absently to the night winds . " Mother , you would be proud of me , I think , for I have tried to do my very best . " Deliberately , to change her thoughts and depressing mood , she began to concentrate on identifying the night 's fragrances . She started with the tiny , white , star-shaped blossoms on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others . She even caught the faint whiff of roasting lamb . It roused her sense of taste and reminded her of how long it had been since she had eaten . Who , in all of Bethany , would be cooking this time of night ? she idly wondered . Who , but thoughtful Hannah , she realized . No wonder Hannah left early tonight . She wanted to provide for us tomorrow . How dear of her . The pain in her head was still persistent , but now it had enlarged and moved down into her neck and shoulder muscles . It was demanding her full attention . She massaged around her neck and spent some time trying to loosen the hard ropes which seemed to be strangling her , but it was of no use . Everything was knotted into pain . Her mind went back to Lazarus . How many times have I done this for him ? She smiled in a rueful manner as she remembered how one of the villagers , a vulgar man , had teased her about her ability to rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Jerusalem and  | open up a massage shop next to the Romans ' public bathhouse . All her life she had been good with her healing hands , and she knew it with confidence , not conceit ; yet she could not tolerate her failure with Lazarus . It was all so puzzling to her . She was Bethany 's mainstay for the sick . If a woman ailed or a baby was born , if a man was dying or if someone had been injured in an accident , they always sent for her . The villagers knew they could depend on Martha 's calmness , her gift with herbs and ointments , and her talented healing hands . For months now she had used on Lazarus every magical brew of herbs she had ever known . She had wrapped him in every poultice imaginable , and she had done everything there was to do . But now the overwhelming fatigue had robbed her of the ability to think clearly , and as a sudden squally storm could stir a calm lake into a frenzy , she became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have I failed so much ? I 've lost my precious family . I was unable to save any of them . Am Ito lose Lazarus , too ? Am Ito fail again ? " Out of the dark area under the canopy a voice quietly answered . " We could send for the Master . " Martha heard the voice , and the words hit her with the force of a lightning bolt in a thunderstorm . She was up on her feet instantly . On her ascent up , her arm hit two basket trays and sent them flying over the wall and thudding about on the ground below . Immediately Martha remembered how she had sought for Mary earlier and how Mary had simply vanished into the night . Without warning Martha 's anger boiled to the surface of her mind and tongue . She stood in the middle of the roof in front of the canopy , both hands on her hips , and spit out a torrential flow of words , accusations , and penetrating questions . " Mary ! Where have you been all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and help me ? I sent Tabitha to find you . Do n't you know Lazarus almost died ? " She was on the edge of screaming now . " Why did you stay away ? " Finally , she shouted  | the three vital words which were burning within her . " Where were you ? " Mary came out from the awning 's darkness and stood directly in front of Martha . Her hair was all covered by a veil , but her face shone in the moonlight because of the wetness of her cheeks . She was shaking , not because of the night 's chill , but because she 'd never seen or heard Martha so angry . At first she just stood there , with no words to explain her absence . Finally , in her soft but clear , warm voice , Mary slowly confessed , " I 've been up here , my sister . " She put her head down . " I could not come to you . You know how any sickness of others produces my own inner illness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Besides , it was better that I stay here and pray . " She looked up and searched Martha 's face for understanding . " Pray ? " snapped Martha . " Pray  --  when all of Bethany was in our house ? When I have so much to worry about , you disappear and make an added worry ? When everyone had so many tasks to tend ? When our brother would have been soothed by your presence ? You stayed up here and prayed ? " Her exasperation with Mary knew no limits ! After a moment 's pause , she continued her tirade , only now her voice was dripping with sarcasm . " Well , Mary , my dear sister , when you were up here praying , did God answer your prayers or shed any wisdom on our cir-cumstances ? " Mary , sensitive to the events which provoked Martha 's rage , ignored the tone of her sister 's question and answered evenly , " Yes , Martha , He did answer . He is a loving God and full of justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked to the roof 's edge to absently look down the main hill road which led towards Jerusalem . Mary moved behind her , and after hesitating for a moment , she took ahold of Martha 's arm and said carefully , " I think it is God 's will that we send for Jesus . He loves our brother . They are the dearest of friends . We have never asked the Master for healing . But now we need him if Lazarus is to be restored . " She  | did not catch Martha 's impatient sigh . Grateful for the passing of a sudden gust of cold wind , Martha used the difficult moment to pick up an old shawl which had been left on the edge of a jar . After she pulled the shawl around her shoulders , she clearly , and surprisingly without hostility , said , " If he really is who he says he is  --  God , " she pronounced the name skeptically , " then we would not have to send for him . He would already know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of her neck ever so slightly as she heard her sister 's nearly blasphemous statement . Martha waited for her words to sink in and then , looking directly at Mary , said , " Do n't condemn me with those righteous eyes of yours , my sister . You know you have already wondered why Jesus has not come on his own before this , have n't you ? " Mary knew full well she was no match for Martha 's logical debates ; so she simply shrugged her shoulders and answered , " Honestly , I know somewhere in your words are buried truths , but it would take wisdom beyond my understanding and logic beyond my ability to unravel the mysteries of what you have just said . " Lamely at first , and then tenderly but with more authority , she went on . " All I know is that tonight as I prayed , I felt we should send for the Master . From there , my sister , I just do n't know . " Mary 's openness had more than once softened Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty flowed over Martha like a warm , fragrant oil , soothing away the exhausted woman 's feelings . It is such a bewildering , confusing time , Martha thought . One moment I am angry and shouting , and the very next moment I am sad and inwardly weeping . All the order seems to have gone out of my life , and now I have lashed out at Mary ; yet she answers me with soft truthfulness and gentle love . Martha turned , shook her head , and with glistening eyes , embraced her sister . " I am truly sorry I spoke so harshly , beloved one , " Martha apologized , patting her sister 's shoulders . " Forgive me . My mind does not seem to be pulling together as it always has . " Inside she felt as if her life was a cart hitched up to two unequally yoked animals , with a horse pulling one way and  | an ox pulling the other . Everything was so wrong and so baffling . She longed for the clear , decisive world of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peculiar , searching way . It was obvious that some unseen thought had unbelievably formed itself into a startling realization , and looking directly at Martha , she said , " But you still do n't think we should send for Jesus , do you , Martha ? " Martha tried to sound nonchalant . " No . It is simply that I am not sure we have the right to ask . " She then brought up the friendship of the past three years and how it would be an imposition for Jesus to come . She continued , over Mary 's softly voiced objections , with the fact that Jesus was in precarious circumstances as it was . She would have gone on with her list of arguments except that Mary cut to the heart of it with , " You think it 's too late for Lazarus ! That 's it , is n't it ? You think he 'll be dead before we can reach the Master . You do n't think Jesus will reach here in time , is that it ? " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncanny ability to sense the core of a problem and dig up the deep , covered-up issues of the heart . On this one , she had hit Martha dead center with her arrow of truth . Mary touched Martha 's cheek and turned her face toward her own and directly questioned , " He is that sick ? Lazarus is really so sick that he may die in a few days ? " Her voice was breaking here and there . Martha turned away and said flatly , " No . He may be already dead . He spilled much of his lifeblood tonight , and his body was burning with more heat than I 've ever seen or felt before . His breathing comes in jerks and pauses like the steps of an old man coming down a dangerous , steep path . One does not know when the next breath will come , or if it will come at all . He lies with a death mask on his face . " " Oh , do n't , " Mary cried . " Do n't say those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is true . " Martha straightened up , tall and unbending , and matter-of-factly smoothed her hair so it was all caught under the coiled braid at the nape of her neck . After adjusting her shawl , she said , " Come , we will go to  | him . I will show you what I mean . " Mary did not move or respond . " Mary , Mary , " Martha walked up behind her and said softly in her ear . " Dear sister , I know Jesus can heal . Have n't we both seen him with our own eyes ? " Mary nodded . " It 's just that this time , " Martha hesitated . " This time , it 's too late . Lazarus has been sick too long , and time has run out for him . " " Then you are forgetting our kinsfolk in Capernaum . " Mary 's quiet voice chilled the air . " Our kinsfolk ? " Martha wondered aloud . " Oh , yes , " she said as she remembered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah 's recovery . " " Sarah 's recovery ? " Mary stared at her sister . " It was much more than a recovery ! Uncle Jairus said she had died ; yet Jesus raised her from the deep pool of death and brought her back ! " " But , " Martha stammered , " that was different . " " Different , how ? " demanded Mary . " Well , " Martha 's tone was getting impatient , " Sarah never had been sick a day in all of her brief twelve years . She could have merely had a sleeping sickness which overcame her that morning and then . . . . " " No ! " Mary 's voice was strained and taut . " That 's not what happened . She was dead , not sleeping , and Jesus raised her . Besides , Philip and Andrew both told us about being with Jesus in the city of Nain and how a widow 's son was raised from the dead . . . . " " All this talk is needless , " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of Jesus , Mary . How could one person do so many things and be in so many places ? Besides , I tell you , it is different for our Lazarus . " " I know what 's the matter with you , Martha . " Mary was as close to raising her voice as she had ever been . " You believe Jesus can do certain things , like healing people , but only up to a point or under the right circumstances . You think of Jesus as another Simeon , the magician  --  a person who can do some magic tricks , but not all . You 've turned our Master into a magician ,  | and a limited magician at that ! " Her subdued fury flung itself noisily into the night . " That 's not true ! " Martha angrily countered , as she gripped Mary 's shoulders . " I believe in his divine gifts . . . I 've seen him heal . . . I know his power . It 's just that I have also seen Lazarus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she continued . " While you 've been up here communing ' with God , I 've been watching our brother 's life ebb away . He 's almost gone . If Jesus were here now  --  this moment  --  I believe he could put the light back into Lazarus 's eyes . But he 's not here , and I just know it 's too late . I have to be realistic about this . I also know there is a time to be born and a time to die , and from everything I 've seen , it is Lazarus 's time . " Seeing she was getting nowhere , Martha abruptly took charge and guided her sister across the roof to the stairway , tersely saying , " Come , see for yourself . " The moon was slipping down behind one set of hills , and the sun was creeping up over the other . The crickets had slowed their song almost to a complete stop as the two young women made their way down the outside staircase . They entered Lazarus 's large chamber to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . While everything appeared to be pretty much as it had been , Martha instantly knew something was different . She hurried to him . His dark brown hair and beard were damp to her touch as she smoothed it . His eyes opened , and though deep , dark halfcircles lay under them , Martha thought she saw a glimmer of his old sparkle , and suddenly she was encouraged . " Martha , " Lazarus said faintly , and she leaned closer to catch each word . " Is it morning yet ? " The sleeping women awoke with a start at the sound of his voice . What a delight ! What wonderment ! Not only did he recognize her , but he asked a reasonable question . Was he better ? Martha 's thoughts raced wildly . Behind her , Mary questioned , " What did he say ? " Smiling , Lazarus said , " If someone would draw back the tapestries , I could tell if it is morning , if only someone would . . . . " He spoke quite clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor is alive ! Martha 's thoughts flashed , and she breathed deeply . Naomi and Leah left hurriedly to tell the others of this miraculous change . " Mary , pull back the curtains . " Martha 's command was almost joyous . Lazarus 's room faced the east , and since the first rosy haze of dawn had begun , the light filtered in  --  pale , but lovely . Is it the warm color of the morning sun , or is it really his coloring that tells me he looks better ? Is he , or is the sun playing tricks on me ? Martha wondered . He did look so much better . She was still unable to take it all in . But just as she was sorting it all out in her mind , Mary tugged at her arm and silently motioned her to follow . Out in the hall , using guarded , whispered tones , both women began talking at once . " It 's a sign ! " Mary enthused . " Maybe Jesus has already healed him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but should n't we send for Jesus , anyway ? " Mary urged . " Yes , perhaps that 's wise . " Martha surprised herself with her abrupt turnabout . Together they went back to him . " What are you two planning ? " Lazarus asked and managed a weak smile . " We thought you 'd like to see the Master , " Mary explained . He nodded and ever so softly said , " Yes , yes . I 'd like that . I am lonely to see his face , and it would be good to hear his voice . " On hearing this , Martha left them hurriedly , and her words " I 'll see to it " made them smile knowingly at each other . Mary was on familiar ground with this Lazarus , and she could freely give of herself to his needs . It was the other Lazarus , the one impaled by the sword of pain or quivering on the brink of death , to whom she was of no help at all . Only Martha could treat and minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so improved , she was pleased that Martha had left her in charge of him , and she was filled with a contagious kind of joy .  | Mary perched herself on the edge of his pallet like a small sparrow on a tree branch , and for some time they needed no words . They drank in the stillness and the peace of the lovely dawn . A bit later Mary questioned , " Could you sip some water , dear Lazarus ? " He answered with something , but she missed it ; so he spoke up and said , " No , nothing . Just sing for me . " Her laugh bubbled out of her , and she said , " Oh , no . I would sound like a frog croaking in the creek bed . Besides , what would I sing ? " He spoke slowly , but softly ; so she bent closer to him to catch his words . " When we were children , you made up songs for any occasion . Do it now , " he whispered . Delighted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large cushion from his pallet , placed it on the floor nearest his head , and plopped down on it with childlike grace . " Alright big brother , but it might not be very good and remember you 'll have to add a verse of your own . " Id Her humming began immediately and so did the mischievous twinkle in her eyes . Lazarus silently watched the face of his beautiful sister , and she , catching the look of dear love , became even more beautiful . After she thought and hummed a bit , she checked with him and asked playfully , Are you ready for this ? He nodded and blinked one eyelid to show his approval . The foolish little song , written in a moment and inspired by the moment , came liltingly out of Mary 's clear and bell-like voice . Jesus is coming today , today . Oh , give him sparrows ' wings on his feet , So he can fly to us , this day , This day . Jesus is coming today , today . Oh , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , this day , This day .  | Here Lazarus chuckled softly . " You 're right , " he said . " It 's not very good . " Ignoring him , with a look of mock indignation , she continued . Jesus is coming today , today . Oh , give him fast little rabbits ' feet , So he can hop to us this day , This day . Mary stopped her singing , and suppressing a small giggle , she said as sternly as she could , " Now , Lazarus , for the next verse it 's your turn . " Turning up her pert little nose , she said , " You 'll see how it takes a lot of natural talent to compose songs . " She stole a peek at him . He was still smiling . " Come , now , it 's your turn , Lazarus . . . Lazarus ? . " She touched his arm . The smile was there , but he was not . Abruptly the song and the game were over . He had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to move . The only sound from her was her repeated cry of " Martha . . . Martha . . . Martha , " but it was barely whispered ; so no one heard , and no one came .  | WHEN she had seen Lazarus 's good color and heard his weak but clear words , Martha bounded down the stairs with a newfound supply of energy , rushed through the main floor of the house into the cooking area , and almost knocked Naomi off her feet . " He 's better , is n't he ? " the old woman smiled as she asked . Martha flew past her and out the back entrance , into the small courtyard , and over to the men 's sleeping quarters . While running , she shouted back over her shoulder , " Yes , much better ! You 'll be happy to know , old dear , I am sending Joseph to fetch Jesus . " Naomi clasped her hands together and blessed the Lord for answering her prayers . It was not seemly that she go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened the door , barely stuck her head inside , and softly called , " Joseph ? " Samuel , Joseph 's father , had tended the sheep and goat herds , and as Joseph grew into manhood , his father taught him the skills of shepherding . Joseph was four years older than Martha and had never married . After the death of his father and Master Josiah , Martha made Joseph the head overseer for the flocks and fields . He served the Josiah Ben Jochanan family well , and Martha paid his wages affectionately , generously , and as if he were kinfolk . When he thought he heard her voice in the yard , he appeared almost at once while pulling on his outer tunic . Joseph 's first anxious questions were of Lazarus . Hurriedly Martha told him of Lazarus 's new turn for the better . As she was explaining her request that he find Jesus , someone tugged on her sleeve .  | " Mistress Martha ? " She turned to look down into the young , alert face of Aaron . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently . " If it is runners you want to go get Jesus , we would like to go . " The pride and confidence ringing in his voice was rare in such a young servant , and Martha marveled at it . " Who is we ' ? " she questioned . " Oh , Jude and I , " and he straightened his shoulders as he said it . " Jude and Aaron . I might have known , " Martha said with a grin playing around the corners of her mouth . Both Aaron and Jude , now about ten years old , had been orphaned earlier , and though they were not related , you could hardly have one without the other . Naomi had timidly brought the thin , spindle-legged Jude into the household . Mary had made a promise to a dying young mother on the outskirts of Bethany one day , and Aaron had solemnly clung to her hand as she brought him home . For five years now the boys had lived in the servants ' quarters , and in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , and developing under Joseph 's fatherly hand , the boys flourished and became brothers . " We talked yesterday , " Aaron said earnestly , " and we hoped that if you wanted to send for the Master , you would let us go . " As if to ensure his argument , he added , " We would be faster than Claudius 's horse ! " Martha thought his choice of man and horse was excellent . She had always felt Claudius was very different from any Roman soldier she had ever known . He was a centurion who , unlike others , seemed to have a God-fearing soul and no one , she knew , had a horse like his . It was powerful and magnificent , since it was bred from Libyan stock . Claudius was frequently approached by a buyer eager to purchase the horse , but more often he was offered money for bets to race him . Martha could not remember exactly when she had first met Claudius , but usually when Jesus was visiting them , Claudius would ride into the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star on its forehead . He would stay listening intently to everything Jesus taught . Martha always included him in the evening meal , although she knew having a Roman to dinner was not socially acceptable , and there were many disturbed eyebrows raised among her neighbors . The servant boys , however , loved Claudius 's visits and made frantic scrambles to see who would get to water and feed the great stallion . " Apparently , " Martha leaned down toward Aaron , " you are on good terms with Claudius 's horse ? " His face beamed his triumphal answer , and she suspected that " watering the horse " really meant " riding " him to the trough . " Good ! " she said , " because both you and Jude had better be just as fast and durable ! " She shook her finger at him , and he responded with a smile to match the twinkle in her eyes . Privately she wished somewhat grimly that Claudius and his horse were standing before her instead . " Yes , Mistress Martha . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtained doorway , she called to him , " When you 're ready , come to the house . " Joseph was not convinced as he listened to her conversation I ! with Aaron ; so he questioned , " Mistress Martha , in view of the difficulty in finding Jesus , are you sure they should go ? I will go myself . The task needs a man . " " No , " she smiled . " I really want you here , dear Joseph . " As she rubbed at the fatigue in her eyes , she said , " Jesus should not be too hard to find as I know the general area where he 's teaching . The thing that does concern me is the ugly rumors of death threats against him which are circulating out of Jerusalem . Jesus may not want to journey this way , but certainly that will not hinder the boys . " " But , " countered Joseph , " the roads are so dangerous  --  filled with cutthroats and thieves . I fear for their safety . " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be swift a enough , and two runners are safer than one . Now , do not fret about them as I want you to stay here . Besides , if my brother continues to improve as he has done this morning , I 'll want you  | Remember , " she continued , " the boys ' love for the Master and their enthusiasm for some new adventure will have a way of making their feet exceedingly swift . " She was anxious to get back to her duties , so Martha left and said as she went , " You 'll see , Joseph , they will find Jesus . In no time at all they will all come , and Jesus will be here ! " " I hope so , Mistress . I hope so , " he said , not quite sure if he believed his own words . Most of the servant girls were still sleeping , trying to catch up on several nights ' wakefulness , but Naomi was too excited to sit down , much less sleep . By the time Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires in the bake ovens and had awakened them into bright coals . She was already elbow deep in bread dough when she stopped to look over at Martha . " I am sending Aaron and Jude instead of Joseph . I do n't know how long it will take the boys to find Jesus , " Martha said as she sat down on a low stool . " Do we have any bread or cakes to give them as they run ? " Naomi nodded affirmatively , pulled her hands out of the big puffy gloves of dough , and said , " I 've no bread , but I do have some cracknel cakes and plenty of dried apricots and figs . " After she dusted the last of the flour off her hands and arms , Naomi took several small grain cakes from a wooden cupboard , broke them apart , poured a little honey on each side , and stacked them neatly back together again . She selected the plumpest dried fruit from a woven basket tray and tied the whole thing up in a tidy satchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her pace very slow , but the importance of the mission gave her great determination . She finished tying it all up just as the boys came breathlessly through the door . " Here , " said Martha as she handed the satchel to Aaron . " This is to tide you over until you find Jesus . " Then , smiling , she said , " Even Claudius 's horse would need some grain for this task . " Holding the satchel and jiggling it up and down like he was  | weighing the contents , Aaron looked at Naomi , smiled a shy smile , and said , " Thank you very much . We shall enjoy every bit of it ! " Then , serious all at once , he turned to Martha and said , " Shall we go straight to the temple in the city to find him ? " " No , I have heard that the Master is in the Perea area across the Jordan River and to the north . I understand he is teaching and preaching in those small cities up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be too difficult a task to find him . However , if you have to ask someone if he has been to his village , do it with caution . He has his enemies . Please remember , haste is most important . " The boys nodded soberly , their dark eyes dancing with the danger of their mission . " Then , " Martha continued , bending down to their eye level , " when you find him , give him this exact message . Say , Master , our mistress , Martha , needs you in Bethany . Please come as quickly as you can . ' " She paused , straightened up a bit , and , frowning , said , " No , no , not that . Just tell him simply , Master , the one you love is sick . ' " She made both of them repeat the message to her and was pleased that they were as solemn as if they were taking a holy oath . Those words will be enough , she thought . Jesus will know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though he knows the danger , he will come straight to Bethany . " Now , be off with you , " Martha said . Giving the boys a playful swat , she hurried with them as they left the back entrance . Then down through the side gardens , past the inner courtyard well , and to the main iron gates in the outer wall , which closed off the street , she half ran behind them . At the gate she touched both their shoulders and said , " The Lord go with you , my sons , and may He grant you the speed of fleeting deer . " Or Claudius 's horse , whichever is faster , please , Lord , she thought . They ran down the steep street , their sandals loudly clattering over the stones in the early hush of dawn , and she watched until even the sound was gone . For some time Martha stood leaning against the gates just breathing in the warm peace of the morning . Nobody was about ,  | and only a few early birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she thought she heard Mary 's voice calling her , the morning was as still and lovely as she had ever seen . She savored it deeply . For a moment she considered going back to the house and resuming her duties , but the day was so beautiful , and she was so in need of a change of pace after the frantic past two days that she decided to walk downhill to her father 's olive grove . All the way down the street she reasoned that nothing was pressing . She was tired , and she felt she could well afford the luxury of not bestirring herself for a few moments . She did n't even bother to call Naomi . Martha simply pulled her shawl over her head and leisurely strolled down the hill , turned at the bottom to another steep hill , and quickly reached the wall surrounding the trees . Josiah , her father , a man of practicality and intelligence , also had been blessed with a creative imagination . Their house , his business in Jerusalem , and this grove were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove through a small break in the stone dike wall and climbed back up the terraced hillside to the highest row of olive trees . This is no ordinary grove , she thought and smiled . It was so much more . Even the stone walls which kept the land from slipping and sliding down the hill in the rainy season were planted with various vines and flowers . They were popping up here and there along the top . The olive trees themselves were healthy , fruitful , and , Martha thought , the most graceful of all trees except for willows . The crop was about five months away , but the trees were heavy with the feathery blossoms , and she knew the harvest would be extra special . Between the trees , her father had planted rows and clumps of many different species of flowers . It was a splendid grovegarden . More Mary 's place than mine , acknowledged Martha , but this morning it did not matter . Lazarus was better  --  or was he ? Deep down on some hidden crossroad of her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suddenly sit up , take in nourishment , and his family would rejoice  --  only  | to watch in disbelief as he died that night or a day later . " It is not good for me to dwell on these thoughts , " she said abruptly , but bits and pieces of her memories clung stubbornly to her inner parts . Ignoring her deep feelings , she rationalized , " No , he is better  --  much better . " But a part of her stood away from herself and said , " Why do you deceive yourself when you know better ? " The day is a day of beauty , the garden flowers are bursting into the spring air with a rainbow of colors , and I am determined to let nothing spoil the majestic peace this place gives to me , Martha said to herself . She absolutely gulped in the fresh , flower-scented air , and nothing had ever felt so good . He is better , she said over and over to herself . Still a part of her resisted the knowledge . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper hill and came to the tiny hut her father had built as a storage room for his tools . The hillside was watered by a small reservoir , and nearby was one of her father 's ingenious clay pipes which supplied just the right amount of water . Martha sat on a low bench outside the hut and remembered all the times this grovegarden had been a playground for Mary and her . In fact , she remembered it was at this very spot , so many years ago , she had discovered her very own gift  --  her gift of healing from Jehovah . Martha looked down at the clay pipe and a faint " ah , ha " broke into the morning . It was that very pipe with its little trickle of water . Right here is where my gift of healing all started , she thought . How old was I ? she stirred her memories . Ah , yes , I must have been ten , and Mary just five . We played a game that day of hide and seek in this grove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide behind the hut . She fell into a small grassy area between some bushes and the pipe and flattened herself against the ground to escape Martha 's sharp eyes . Mary told her later that she was shivering with excitement as Martha came up the hill . But just as Martha had reached the hut , Mary spotted a plant by the watering pipe , and abruptly the game lost its significance . " Martha . . . over here ! " Mary had called . She jumped up ,  | giving her place away . " Come here and look . . . quickly , " she urged . She was almost in tears as she parted the grass and showed Martha the plant . Martha , breathless from the hurried climb , fearing a snake or some poisonous insect , laughed aloud with relief when she saw the plant . " It 's not funny . " Mary 's bottom lip formed a small pout , and her eyebrows pulled into a frown . " Someone has stepped on that plant . I ca n't remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers on it . Now it 's all broken . Will the plant die ? " Mary 's sensitive eyes and heart were full of concern as she questioned her sister . Martha stopped her laughing smile when she saw how serious Mary was taking all this and said soberly , " Well , let me see if I can help . " Martha remembered her sentence about the plant that day was the first time she had actually put those words into the open , but it was not the last time , by any means . " Let me see if I can help " became her motto , her personal creed , and eventually her ultimate goal . It had all started in this grove-garden by the clay pipe , so long ago . Martha recollected that she had lain down in the grass to get a better look at the plant . Instinctively , she pinched off a few of the most shriveled , yellowing stems , found a little piece of olive branch , and stirred the ground all around the plant . Then , cupping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully soaked the ground . After she had sent Mary to find a straight , short stick , she went into the hut for some strips of cloth . Mary finally found the right stick , " sturdy and tall enough , " and Martha cautiously pushed it into the ground beside the main stem . Then she gently tied up the wilting plant with the strips of cloth . " There , now , " she said as she rinsed off her hands . " We 'll come back and water it each day to see if it will grow again , little sister . " Mary 's large blue eyes sparkled with obvious faith and confidence in Martha 's ability . Not more than three days later Mary 's faith was confirmed .  | She swooped into the inner courtyard , panting from her run and called , " Martha , Martha , come see it ! It 's beautiful . It 's not going to die . You saved it ! You saved it ! " Together the two little girls , picking up their skirts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down one street , turned the corner , flew down another street to the break in the stone wall , and finally bounded up the hill to the pipe . Breathlessly , Martha agreed . " It is a beautiful plant . " By examining it closely , she saw the tiny new beginnings of one new leaf , and she flushed with a quiet pride . Her serious side would not allow herself to get overly jubilant , but Mary , on the other hand , had never known any such limitations ; so off she ran to tell their father of Martha 's gift . As Martha remembered it , Mary had told the whole village of Bethany that day . She smiled at the clay pipe and this garden which held so many memories . Martha could not bring to mind anything which suggested that she had used her gift of healing often after the plant that day . But two years later , when she was twelve , unexpectedly she picked up the gift again . It was almost as if her healing talents had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered , unearthed , and ready to be spent . On that day so long ago , her father had come home from his shop in Jerusalem and was getting the evening report from Joseph 's father , Samuel , about the sheep herds and the terraced farmlands . It was a conversation which he savored slowly each night like a man rolling a good wine over his tongue . Martha always stood close , so she would not miss any detail . Her father had not begun as a farmer or a sheep breeder . His expertise and source of wealth came from an exclusive and expensive shop which he owned in partnership with his brother and was located over the hill in the best trade-shop area of Jerusalem . Between her father and her Uncle Tobias , they had built a handsome business dealing with imported artifacts and luxury household goods . Martha loved to examine the new items in his shop , and once  | in a while she and her sister were allowed to come and spend the afternoon . Naomi would bring them . Martha would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , would squeal with delight over anything that had birds or flowers on it . They both enjoyed looking at their own reflections in the highly polished brass pieces . Martha loved examining the fine filigreed lamps and lamp stands , while Mary was always drawn to the fine selection of alabaster boxes and candlesticks . The shop boasted such wondrous things as bedsteads carved out of wood and inlaid with tortoiseshell or ivory ( once they had one inlaid with real gold ) , multicolored woven rugs from distant seaports , exquisite works of art , cashmeres and silks , and even small heating braziers beautifully fashioned out of bronze . Their house in Bethany held many similar treasures , but always there was some new and exotic prize in the shop , and both girls liked the idea of being the first to see it . Her father saw the shop only as a convenient means to an end . His first love , after Rachel and his children , Martha knew , was not his shop or his buying trips to other countries , or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real love was the land , the sheep , and especially the natural beauty of the hills of Bethany . As soon as her father had made enough money , he could n't move his family out of the noisy , bustling city of Jerusalem fast enough . He bought the choicest spot in all of Bethany , up on a high vantage point with a view of the city . Their home had been built to the eye-popping surprise of the townspeople . When it was finished , Josiah and Rachel filled it with artistic furnishings . Their pallets had carved wooden bedsteads . How that caused talk . Martha laughed with the memory . There were handwoven tapestries for the walls , thick , richly colored carpets for some areas , and even low tables inlaid with other woods and ivory . Martha 's favorite table , which stood at one end of the great hall by a couch , had a highly polished wooden top and was inlaid with ivory . The ivory design was fashioned by a skilled artist to look exactly like grapes hanging from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months of entertainment for the villagers as they gossiped and discussed the great house on the hill . Each day Martha 's father worked in the city , took the short walk home to Bethany at night , and then questioned Bethany 's farmers and shepherds alike about the land and the lovely hills . He kept questioning the shepherds until he found Samuel , the son-of-the-son in a long line of shepherds , who had no flocks of his own , but worked for a hard-driving man in the next valley . Martha recalled that on the same day her father hired Samuel , he acquired Joseph , the son , and two plots of land . One acreage spilled over two hills and was suitable for farming ; the other was the grove she now sat in . As her father 's business continued to be blessed by Jehovah , Josiah took on more land . Soon he was well known for his expansive wheat and barley fields . But his real fame sprang not from his ability to direct the tilling of the soil , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown , and no one could match the choice mutton and tender cuts of lamb or the subtly tinted wool which Josiah and Samuel achieved by crossbreeding . Martha 's reflections were interrupted by some deep stirring of joy , and , surprising herself , she said aloud , " Lazarus is better  --  really better . " Then her thoughts returned to the memories of her healing gifts . Martha , on that day years ago when she was twelve , had listened eagerly as her father , Samuel , and Joseph talked about a sick lamb . The lamb was special since it was sired by his best ram and born of his finest ewe . Joseph was telling her father how many different things they had used in trying to turn the fate around for the lamb , but even his father had been unable to suggest something . Nothing seemed to work in curing the ailing lamb . The men nodded in disappointment . " I thought this offspring would be near perfect , " her father had said sadly . Martha had listened for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard " the lamb is so very ill " a third time , she gently broke  | in with , " Father , where are the sheep grazing ; I mean the herd with this sick lamb ? " " Over yonder , " her father said , making a vague gesture with his hands towards the east . " No , I mean where exactly . I 'd like to go see the lamb . Maybe , Father , I could help . " She did not see Joseph 's annoyed look , but she did hear his low , guttural pronouncement of " How could you help ? " He blurted it out before he could stop himself . Samuel burned a scornful look in his son 's direction . " Perhaps not at all , " Josiah answered for her . " But that Martha cares and would like to go help pleases me . " His answer to Joseph filled her with warmth , and she knew her cheeks were flushed and reddened in response . Turning to Samuel and Joseph directly , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , my fields , and my herds , but this is not so . Standing before me , and two others in the house , are my real delights . They are my fields of pride , my herds of love , and because of them , I love life deeply and am a proud man . " Samuel nodded , but Joseph almost melted in mortification . He had not meant to demean the master 's daughter ; so he hurriedly explained , " Master , all I meant was . . . well , even my father , experienced in such matters had nothing to offer . How could a mere girl help ? " Instantly he knew he had been foolish in his choice of the word mere . This time Josiah 's look silenced him . Her father sat down on a stone bench in the courtyard and said directly to Martha , " My daughter , the eastern slopes are not too far , and there are a few hours of daylight left . You really would like to see if you can help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! " she fairly shouted . Josiah looked at Joseph and said , " You will go with her . " Joseph 's yes was resigned , but without hostility . That her father believed in her , though she was barely out of childhood , touched Martha deeply . In fact , she laughed as she remembered it , she was so thrilled about permission to go that she had been unable , for a change , to say anything . Leaving them in the courtyard , she ran off to get her things together .  | With some help from Naomi , she filled a small goatskin bag with yellow olive oil , took various herbs from her small pottery jars , and carefully wrapped the blend in a linen towel . Naomi found a clean cloth which could be used as a poultice or a plaster if it was needed , and with that Martha was ready . She was a picture of precision . When she finished and came into the cooking area , Joseph just stared at her . He found himself somewhere between marveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she caught his skeptical look , she stated , " Everything in its time and place , Joseph . That is as my father has taught me . We must hurry , but we must not forget something and leave too hastily . The lamb 's life may depend on our thoroughness . " Joseph was only sixteen at the time , and he had never understood women anyway ; so Martha especially puzzled him . She was only twelve and always seemed to know what she was doing . Worse than that , she rarely made a mistake or ran out of energy . Yet decidedly so , he had admitted privately to one of the undershepherds that she would make a good working wife , even if she did make him edgy at the back of his neck . The two of them set off late that afternoon and found the clusters of woolly animals with one of the shepherds holding the ailing lamb . She could not remember exactly what she had done with the lamb , only that she and Joseph had brought it home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had patiently turned the apathetic bag of bones into a fat , energetic nuisance . Everyone , she smiled with the memory , was annoyed with the antics of the cured lamb , except her father . Whenever he saw the mischievous , woolly body , he would catch Martha 's eye and solemnly wink , remembering her part . The news of her success with the lamb would have never spread outside the household , but as usual , Mary told everybody . As she sat in the grove , Martha chuckled and recalled , " That sister of mine told just everybody ! " Martha remembered that slowly at first , but within a year , she began to show up wherever there was an illness . By the time she was thirteen , she had made the acquaintanceship of Mahalath ,  | Bethany 's formidable midwife . Her desire to learn and her caring heart had helped her to brave the moment when she asked Mahalath if she could join her when the next baby was about to be born . Martha remembered the terror in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and spit out contemptuously , " You want to come with me to fill your eyes and head with gory sights so you can gossip about it later ? " " Oh , no , respected Mahalath , " Martha answered . She was terrified , but she went on firmly . " I want to help with the suffering of others , and I want to learn from you . " Before all of this had really penetrated the woman 's inner places , Martha added , " I want you to be my teacher . " " Teacher ? " Mahalath repeated the word carefully and bent down for a closer look at Martha . " I believe you mean it , " she stated . " But you are forgetting who you are , girl ! " the old woman said , scowling . " It is not proper for a daughter from the distinguished house of Josiah Ben Jochanan to dirty her hands with a midwife 's business . " Martha 's shoulders snapped straight , and she seemed to grow taller . Clearly she stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my social standing , and it matters not to me whether the villagers condemn or approve of me . I will not be bound to live by foolish traditions . I have a gift for healing , and I mean to learn about it and use it in all ways possible ! " Mahalath sucked in her breath so it whistled between the space in her two front teeth , and , peering down at Martha , she exclaimed , " Such a rare one , you are ! I can see you are set in your thinking ; so we shall see , Martha . You be ready , waiting , and we shall see . " She went off waggling her head from side to side in wonderment . Martha called to mind that she had almost exploded with joy at the thought of learning from the midwife . Then , to her surprised delight , it was only a week or so later when a small boy from a neighboring house stood at the front gate and yelled , " Mistress Martha shall come with me as Mahalath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mused Martha . Her father had n't been nearly so ready . It had taken Mary to convince him .  | " It 's just not done , " Josiah said . His indignation showed only by the agitated way he tugged on his beard . " The Mahalaths of this world were born to be midwives . It is right and good for them , but it is not for my daughter . We are a distinguished family . Her dignity and reputation will be put into questionable repute if she pursues this . . . . " He would have gone further with his stern rationale , but Mary put everything into its proper place . Her blue eyes were sparkling , wide open yet serious , and Martha thought Mary even looked more beautiful . " For some daughters , my father , you are right . It would put their character in a questionable , even objectionable position , but our Martha has a gift . Even from our childhood Jehovah has blessed her with a special talent for healing . Remember the plants she restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued ? Why should n't she learn from Mahalath ? Perhaps Jehovah has given her a gift for healing people and babies as well as plants and animals . " Mary finished , and Josiah meekly shook his head and nodded yes . Then smiling at Mary , he said in a voice loud enough for Martha to hear , " What you 're really saying is that this old man must not tamper with the mysterious ways of God even if he comes from a distinguished family . " " Something like that , my father , " she murmured quietly . So , in the end , Josiah gave Martha his blessing , and even went so far as to tell Mahalath to " teach Martha appropriately and thoroughly . " Mahalath took the charge seriously . No part of Martha 's training was too obscure or too difficult . Every subject concerning childbirth was carefully covered . It was as if old Mahalath had looked for a pupil all her life so she could leave her village of Bethany and the surrounding countryside in capable hands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Martha . Eagerly she spent many hours with the young girl , teaching her about the Hebrew value of having children . Once , when she was telling Martha how wonderful it was to possess children , she quoted , " . . . like the olive plants round about thy table : Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord . "  | Interrupting her , Martha had asked , " Why have you no olive branches , ' my teacher ? " Her dark eyes were serious and grave with the question . It was as if Martha had scraped a sensitive , festering wound , and the old woman caught her breath up in the hurt of it . " I have this many olive branches , " she said defiantly , holding up four fingers . Then , dropping her voice , she explained . " But as they came , God took them and replanted them in heaven with Him . " Abruptly , without any more explanation , Mahalath plunged into a whole set of rules for the woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught . " The expectant mother is not to take hot baths for fear of miscarrying . She is to develop the proper eating habits . She must avoid salt foods and fat . " Martha 's training went on and on . Mahalath had the list of herbs and other magical remedies to help and ease the time of confinement . She had rules to prevent miscarriage , potions for barrenness , and even advice for those having too many children . It was all a heady and marvelous learning time , and each subject was covered long before Martha ever got to go with Mahalath to see an actual birthing . But by the time the old midwife allowed Martha to witness the big event , Martha was very ready . Her brown eyes were wide open with an exciting amazement , and her admiration for the woman knew no bounds . She watched Mahalath ease the young mother from terrified , screaming anguish into a tearful , yet calm endurance . Then , a few hours later , she saw Mahalath catch the tiny bluish white infant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that the baby was a boy , he had lost his dead look , turned rosy pink , and finally his skin glowed a deep red . His first cry was a cry of victory and a joyous salutation to the three women . Since he carried on a steady stream of cries , Mahalath pronounced him a " healthy olive branch . " In her fiercely dedicated way , she washed him down and rubbed him with salt to prepare him for his wrapping in swaddling clothes .  | Martha had not been too much help that day , for the chills stirred up and down her back and rendered her quite useless . As Martha thought back over those days of learning , she guessed that the reason so many babies lived when Mahalath had been present at their births was possibly because of Mahalath 's own deeply felt losses and her powerful desire to keep as many " olive branches " here on earth . She had been the best midwife anywhere , and now Martha knew the reason . " Mahalath is gone now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat in the garden realizing and appreciating the medical legacy the old teacher had left her . How funny , she reminisced , I still get the same chills after all these years whenever a baby slips into my hands . She sat pondering the times she had been Bethany 's midwife and vividly remembered the moments when she had held aloft , for the mother to see , the precious , wet , squalling olive branch . How special she had felt standing there holding God 's gift of life ! Suddenly Martha 's warm memories were jarringly disturbed . It was as if her thoughts were being invaded by a loudly buzzing bee . She raised her head , listened , and heard another sound . The buzzing was louder and coming closer . She could see a woman 's figure running toward her through the trees . " Martha , Martha ! " Her name was being called frantically . Now there were more bees , and their insistent droning was almost deafening . Stiff with fear , Martha got up and began to run toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commanded her rigid legs to move . Now , running and stumbling , she came through the trees , their low branches scratching her face , and she headed toward the figure . It was Leah . Before Martha reached the girl , the bees stopped their buzzing . Her mind became suddenly still . Then , from somewhere deep inside the marrow of her bones , Martha felt them  --  a hundred furious bees . Their stings burned steadily into her flesh , and she knew , even before she was told , it was too late . Lazarus was dead .  | NOT stopping on the hillside , but catching the girl 's hand , Martha explained deftly , " I know , Leah . I know . " Together they ran from the grove , their faces grim with the knowing . Leah 's voice , choking with tears , sobbed out as they ran , " When I awakened , Naomi had me take some lamb broth up to Lazarus . Mary had her head on his arm , and I thought they were just resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you and said he was gone . " Martha slowed down their pace as Leah , between crying and running , could hardly catch her breath . Both women were aware of others on the street , moving and rushing towards the main gate of her house . Word travels fast in such a small village , reflected Martha as she appraised the crowd and nodded a silent L greeting to those who were ready to give the day to mourning . Martha made sure her face was covered by the mask of calm confidence . However , the fury raging underneath was definitely out of control and completely hidden from the neighbors and friends who were quietly observing her . Inside she was seething with angry fires . There is no mercy , no justice today . Death is my constant companion . Yahweh , where are You ? Have You abandoned me ? Her mind was spilling out one accusation after another . What was it King David had said ? She fiercely tried to remember the words of the psalm she had committed to memory so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The lines surprised her with their apt fitness for the hour .  | My heart is in anguish within me , the terrors of death have fallen upon me . Fear and trembling come upon me , and horror overwhelms me . And I say , " O that I had wings like a dove ! I would fly away and be at rest ; yea , I would wander afar , I would lodge in the wilderness . I would haste to find me a shelter from the raging wind and tempest . " " I would give anything to fly away , " she muttered as she reached her front gate . " What did you say , my child ? " Hannah asked . Her old face was lined with concern , and her voice was warm with tenderness . " Nothing , Hannah , " Martha said , putting her head down as she steered Leah past the small knot of women and into the main courtyard . More words of David pushed into her mind as they entered the house and started for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to herself Martha voicelessly screamed : Save me , O God ! For the waters have come up to my neck . I sink in deep mire , where there is no foothold ; I have come into deep waters , and the flood sweeps over me . I am weary with my crying ; My throat is parched . My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God . She reached the top of the stairs , and regaining some inner composure , mocked herself , and seethingly said , " Yes , David . I , too , seem to be waiting for my God . ' " She began immediately  | to chastise herself for procrastinating so long in calling Jesus . Now it was all over . The Master had n't reached Bethany in time , and the life of her brother had been spilled out , wasted , and once more the family sepulcher would mutely house yet another special love . In Lazarus 's room , everyone was resigned to simply wait for Martha . She felt slightly sick , and a coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how unsure and unsteady I am , they would wait for someone else , she thought tartly . Do n't they know I 'm not their strong stone for leaning ? Still they were waiting , and she knew they were waiting for her . So she squared her shoulders , took a commanding breath of air , formed somewhere deep inside her a terribly intense determination , and strode into his room . Naomi stood with Tabitha and Deborah just inside the doorway . Over by the window waited the sobbing Joseph . His back was toward the room , his head bowed , and his shoulders were shaking with his grief . At first no one spoke , but then Mary , kneeling by Lazarus , sensed Martha 's presence , uttered a small , anguished cry , jumped up to fling herself into Martha 's arms , and overflowed with a rush of tears and words . " He was so much better , " Mary was talking and sobbing all at once . " You saw him , Martha . He was better . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were children . " " Yes , like when we were children . " Martha 's tone was fragrant with bygone memories , and she hugged her sister closer . " Then it was his turn . It was his turn , " Mary dully repeated . She broke away and moved slightly to look down on Lazarus . " But , he was . . . . " Then dropping down beside his pallet , she cried out , " Oh , Martha , he is dead . We have lost him . " For the second time Martha replied , " Yes . " And she repeated Mary 's words , " We have lost him . " She bent down and lifted her sister to her feet . While she brushed some hair from Mary 's eyes and forehead , Martha 's sense of duty returned . She said with quiet authority , " Now I must prepare him for burial . I want you to get Lazarus 's alabaster box from the large closet in the lower chamber . Do you think you can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister . " Mary wiped her face with a linen cloth . " Is there something else I might do ? " she questioned as she reached the door . Martha was standing by Lazarus 's pallet . She looked down at him for a moment , then shook her head . " No , I think not , " her words came out listlessly . Mary disappeared , and Martha looked about the room . " Please go , " she said with quiet dejection . Then , remembering , she added , " Joseph , I 'll need some fresh well water , and , girls , you go with Naomi . She knows where the grave cloths are stored . No one moved ; so she assured them that she was alright and she had much work to do if Lazarus was to be ready for burial by that afternoon . Reluctantly they left with an inner denial keeping their pace slow and their walk stiff . " Oh , Naomi , " Martha called out , and the old woman lifted her head to catch each word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courtyard . Ask them to come up and help me with this , will you ? " Naomi shook her head and nodded yes as she left . The window which earlier had let in the first rosy haze of dawn now shone brightly with sunshine . The tapestry was off to the side where Mary had hurriedly pulled it earlier , and the room was warming with the fresh breath of spring . Martha took the whole of the room into her heart and slowly examined the dear and familiar things . The small carpets were exquisitely woven . Purposely she had selected the most colorful she could find to brighten up his room . The low , highly polished wooden table and matching reclining benches with their thick , scarlet silk cushions were comfortable yet sturdy and practical . On the gleaming white walls hung some imaginative but homemade tapestries . Martha had woven the basic cloths of linen flax into perfection , but Mary had embroidered them with tiny blue and brown birds and delicately wrought pink- and red-hued flowers . The south wall was lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript scrolls were carefully placed in the cases and numbered for quick access . Both Martha and Lazarus  | knew each scroll as if it were an old friend , for it was in this room Lazarus and she had learned to read . Only a select group of friends knew the extent of Martha 's education , for educating a girl was simply not done by any Jewish family . Indeed , to learn reading and writing , Martha had to twist her father 's arm , leg , ( Ind neck before he agreed . Even then the educating was done in this room and very secretively . Education was available only for the male offspring . According to strict Jewish tradition , at age five a Jewish boy began studying . After learning to read and write , the boy was taught exclusively from the text of the Scriptures . Between the ages of ten and fifteen , he could go on to study traditional law or Mishna , and after fifteen , the pupil passed on to higher studies involving theological discussions . So when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the simple teachings of life , and by example they began to learn about their religious heritage . When Rachel died , Naomi took up the teaching , dutifully carrying out all the ceremonies connected with the Sabbath , various festivals , and especially the Passover . When Lazarus was a little past four years old , his father taught him a text of Scripture which contained some of the same letters which were in his Hebrew name . Both Lazarus and Martha had to memorize some of the psalms . One of the rules of Jewish tradition said it was unlawful to live in a town where there was no school ; so Josiah Ben Jochanan checked Bethany before he had their house built , and to his joy he found a small but flourishing school . However , when Lazarus turned six and the time came for him to begin his compulsory education , he was not physically able to sit with the other boys in a semicircle around the teacher to learn . Josiah had been torn with disappointment , but he determined in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one in Bethany had heard of a teacher going to a pupil 's house , but once Josiah thought of it , he did not rest until he had hired a young Jewish Pharisee as the boy 's tutor . At first , during the teaching sessions , Martha , having just  | turned eight , wove little squares of cloth on a tiny loom and occasionally listened . She was only casually interested and stayed mostly out of curiosity . She loved watching the way the young man 's dark-bearded face moved when he talked . Much of what the rabbi taught was written in the scrolls , but a greater part of his teaching was memorized ; so he was forever talking . She was especially delighted when he was excited or reciting something to her brother , Lazarus , because the rabbi 's beard made funny flopping movements . No one knew , not even Martha herself , when the delighted fascination with the bushy black beard ended and the serious , attentive listening began . Certainly the teacher never dreamed the girl was learning all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have doubled his fee . In the years that followed , Lazarus learned the text of the Old Testament , starting with the Book of Leviticus and the other books of the Pentateuch . Later he went on to the Prophets and other books with Martha following close behind . After Martha began catching on to the ways of reading , she persuaded her father with such supplication that her education could be invaluable to him in case , the Lord forbid , anything happened to him , especially in view of Lazarus 's frail condition . She argued someone should be able to read and write in the family . It was clear , even in their early childhood , that Mary would be extremely creative and talented with her hands and would probably excel musically , but Martha had been blessed with other talents . Both Martha and Lazarus loved reading and the challenge of writing , and they spent considerable hours learning and absorbing their skills . In fact , reading the scrolls and printing , first on astraca , which was broken pieces of pottery and easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were some of the few things Lazarus could do without his fragile body becoming overly taxed . Martha acted as his encourager and motivator , and together they spent as many afternoons as Lazarus could physically tolerate enjoying the manuscripts . Josiah did n't exactly know what to make of Martha 's education .  | Women who could read and write were virtually unknown in his Jewish circle of friends although someone he knew had heard rumors that Greek and Roman women were occasionally educated . He was mildly amused that his man-child had been taught his education , while his daughter had " overheard " hers . Later on , Martha 's theological questions and answers , as they lingered over the evening meal , were so challenging that Josiah sometimes forgot she was a girl . Once he found himself slapping her on the back when she had made an astute point as if she were an old and familiar crony of his . Her intellectual perceptions and mental alertness were , in some ways , a mild embarrassment . " After all , " he confided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd hoped for great intellect from my son and , indeed , he has a fine mind , but from my daughter  --  ah . . . " and his voice trailed off . To Martha he had merely said , " You are a surprising package ! " as he shook his head and finger lovingly at her . Martha looked fondly at the wall cases holding all the scrolls and would have stood there longer , wrapped in the cocoon of her peaceful memories , had she not been startled by a discreet cough . She whirled around to face Hannah and Ruth . Both women had helped with burial preparation before , and they rushed to her , embracing her with tears , not words . Martha was at once relieved and pleased with their willingness to help and their understanding stillness . When they stepped back , Martha rolled up the wide sleeves of her wrinkled , soiled tunic , and , as if it were a signal , Ruth and Hannah attended to theirs . Joseph , Naomi , and Mary all came , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordlessly departed . His entire body had to be ceremonially washed and cleaned ; so with Ruth at Lazarus 's head , Hannah on one side , and Martha on the other , they began their painful assignment . They worked as silently as the white , fleecy clouds that floated in the blue sky above their roof . Martha uncovered Lazarus and busied herself by folding the thick coverlet . She placed it on the floor by the feet , and then  | gently , as if she did not want to awaken him , she slipped off the short undergarment she had put on him during the night , pulling it over his arms and head . Now he lay before them naked and exposed . The dead have no defenses , but then I suppose it does n't matter , she thought bleakly . The modesty of Martha and the two women which forbade them to look upon nudity was set aside for the moment , and all of them gaped in disbelief at his collection of bones . Every part of him seemed to be held together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than dark , sunken chasms , and his cheekbones protruded above his tangled beard . His ribs , like thin , bony fingers , showed clearly on each side of his chest . He was as white as marble except for the dark red scab-covered sores on his elbows , backside , and heels . Their eyes could hold no more ; so they straightened up and pulled away . Instinctively they pulled their veils over their faces , for they were almost overcome by the sores ' foul and pungent stench , which rose above him and hung between him and the women like an invisible shield . Ruth was the first to return to the tasks . She turned and brought the first of many basins of water close to his head , while Hannah prepared the towels by his side . Martha began to wash him . She touched his wispy , slightly matted hair and ran her fingers through his thin beard . Unsuccessfully , Martha tried to remember what it looked like before this last illness had devastated it . Hannah kept her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears kept cascading down her face and splashing noisily into the basin , but very few words were passed among them . Martha , solemn and dry eyed , imparted short , tight-lipped instructions only when it was imperative . She would have kept up her disciplined control , at least outwardly , as she finished bathing each part of his body , had it not been for the sight of the alabaster box . Her father , Josiah , had given each of them their own extravagantly beautiful box containing precious burial ointments.  | tinder the richly veined , white stone lid were four clothwrapped glass vials . Martha 's composure began to crack and shatter when , out of the corner of her eye , she saw the box on the low table where Mary had left it . However , after she undid the lid and broke off the end of the first vial and began spreading its highly perfumed contents over Lazarus 's emaciated body , her calm gave way to utter chaos . The potent , almost inebriating fragrance of the ointment , his body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of all his bones thinly disguised under his skin , and her overwhelming sense of loss all gathered together in a murky sea of grief and prepared to drown her . Martha fell across his body , and a fearful , terrifying darkness closed down upon her . Somewhere in the dimness she thought she heard voices , and once she felt herself moving through the room , but the effort to speak was too great ; so she lay submerged in her watery abyss . " Martha , Martha , dear . " It was Hannah bending over her and speaking louder than usual so Martha would hear . " You are worn out . Just lie still and rest while we finish . You have not rested or eaten for so long that it is no wonder your strength fails . " It 's true , Martha thought , making sense out of Hannah 's words , but she tried anyway to get off the reclining bench . Firm hands stayed her and held on obstinately . " When Ruth and I have finished , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . " Hannah 's words drifted in and around her , and Martha was too tired to protest . By moving her head to the side , Martha could see the two women as they worked , winding the grave cloths around him . There was something wrong with his body , or was it the grave cloths ? Martha turned her head away in the confusion of it all , and suddenly the memory of all the others she had wrapped paraded before her . The memories iced her veins with a chill , and even with her eyes firmly shut , she could clearly see Benjamin . No , that 's not Benjamin . It 's Lazarus , her mind was spinning . Then she puzzled , Am I dreaming or is that my love over there  | on the pallet being wrapped ? Martha struggled to force her eyes open , but when the effort failed , she called out frantically , " Benjamin , my beloved , my husband , is it you ? " The dream , or whatever it was , did not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a muffled voice , and she decided the figure was Benjamin after all , and not Lazarus . He lay very still as she wrapped the cloth around his body . She was fourteen the first time she had heard Benjamin 's name in connection with hers , and Martha had stiffened in amazement ! Her father and her Uncle Tobias were talking . They were sitting on a rose-hued marble bench in the side gardens , under the shade of a large flowering vine tree , when she accidently came upon them and overheard her name . As it turned out , they were conversing about  --  of all things  --  arranging a marriage between herself and Tobias 's son , Benjamin ! Martha knew , as did every proper Jewish girl , someday a marriage would be arranged for her and for Mary , but somehow she had n't dreamed it would be this year  --  the year of her fourteenth summer . Her body had become a woman two years earlier , and her mind had awakened even before that , but there had only been shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cousin Ben-jamin ! For Mary it was a different jar of water , Martha clucked her tongue knowingly . Every eligible son in all of Bethany and even some in Jerusalem had seen Mary , and all wondered who would win her hand in marriage . No one had ever overlooked or ignored Mary 's awe-inspiring face , her azure blue , angel eyes , the sunrise color of her hair , or her dazzling smile which devasted gloom and warmed even the coldest of hearts . " Now , me , " Martha half smiled , " I have other avenues of talent . " The realization consoled her  --  but not much , nor often . Many times she and Mary had seen Benjamin in Jerusalem , both at the shop and in Uncle Tobias 's home , but Martha had said very few words to her young cousin . About the only thing she knew for certain was that she was four years younger than he and a half a head taller . Even when the betrothal was announced in the synagogue ,  | and she peeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the men 's , she still could n't believe what both her eyes and ears told her . " What frightens you , Martha dear ? " her father questioned her the day after the Sabbath . She was no withering , wilting flower on a vine , but a strong girl ; courageous and competent in any situation , her father reasoned , but the betrothal and coming marriage clearly filled her with dread  --  if not fear . " I am not sure , my father , " she responded , " but I think it is the thought of leaving Bethany and living in the city . " It was an answer he could readily understand , for his love of the little town of Bethany burned strong within his breast . He smiled warmly and put a protective arm around her as they walked down to the grove-garden . " I thought you might be worried about liking him  --  or even loving him , " he smiled at her . " No , you have often reminded me of the saying , Love comes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen that way between my mother and you , " she said with a mischievous smile playing around the corners of her mouth . His ears turned an instant bright scarlet . " You never did miss much , did you , my girl ? Does that head of yours ever forget anything ? " he laughed as he asked . " Not too much , " she said , playfully ducking her head in an attempt to be modest . " But I do know that when you left Jerusalem one bleak , cold day on a camel caravan to buy things in warm , sunny Capernaum , you came home with more than the seaport 's imported goods , Galilean handcrafts , and sunshine ! You came home with moonbeams and stars in your eyes . Uncle Tobias told me of it . " " What else did that old rascal tell you ? " " Only that he could get no work out of you until you went back and married the girl , " Martha laughingly replied . " So it was , " said Josiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's union was not arranged by our families , although Aunt Sarah had my cousin Dorcus all ready and eager . But you 'll see , Martha , this marriage between you and Benjamin will work out exceptionally well . Perhaps even as well as your mother 's and mine , " he added , trying to assure her .  | Josiah continued because he thought she needed some added encouragement and said , " I 've worked with him , you know . " He leaned closer to her face as they walked through the flower beds in the grove . " While he is a bit reserved and quiet , he is a fine young man of honor and one who fearfully and respectfully worships Jehovah . " Her father kept hoping his words would hasten Martha 's acceptance of Benjamin , for he knew once she made up her mind things would go well . " Father , it is not only the moving to Jerusalem which troubles me ; it is something else . " Here she hesitated , afraid of offending the dearest person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . So she blurted out , " It is just that he is , at times , so clumsy . " She lowered her eyes and bent her head to escape her father 's incredulous look as she knew she had to do some further explaining before he would reach any understanding . " I do n't know how many times I have stood by and watched him drop and break something , stumble over a stool , or misjudge the opening of a doorway , " she explained . Her father was beginning to make a stab at understanding , but he still stood staring at her . " You know me well , dear Father , and I have very little patience with someone like that . I admire a person who does things with accuracy , who does n't waste time or have delays  --  like you , Father . " She added the last words , hoping the truth would penetrate . It found its mark , and Josiah threw his head back and gave a short laugh . " My dear child , Benjamin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he first came to us at the shop , he was an overeager-to-please apprentice in selling , and he caused us much bewilderment . He was always bumbling about , and he did knock over a few things . Once his elbow reduced a finely crafted pottery vase , worth many silver talents , into a hundred tiny pieces . " Her father clenched his fist over his heart as if the memory still pained him . " But , Martha , " he continued , " Benjamin has matured , and age seems to have smoothed out the unexpected thrusts and turns of his arms and limbs . In fact , his footsteps are as cautious  | and well placed as those of a young lion . He is not as you remember him . " " I see , " Martha replied gravely , meaning that what she could see was that the matter of her marriage had been settled , and she no longer had any real choice . Two months after their conversation in the grove , the dowry settlement was agreed upon and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha , as she knew she would , married young Benjamin . It was a wedding to be remembered , and no one who had been there ever forgot the day . The noisy , ecstatic wedding procession , made up of young and old alike and headed by the nervous bridegroom , wound its way up the streets of Bethany to the bride 's house . The hills rang of all the singing , dancing , and clowning which went on joyously around the pale-faced , colorfully dressed Benjamin . The festivities picked up considerably after they entered Josiah 's courtyard . There , several young men added the beauty , and the noise , of four cymbals , two flutes , and one lute . Flowers were everywhere  --  spilling out of large jars , in garlands around the necks of the guests , or merely caught and held by waving hands . The biggest commotion was in the people themselves . They were dressed in their finest rainbow-colored tunics , and their conversations were bursting with humorous tales and endless teasing . Their laughter , singing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart had pounded with vague fluttering of fearful expectation . Martha had given in to Mary 's insistent pleading and had used special ointments on her face and a heady perfume on her neck , but it was not to her liking or preference . She did it because it was simply easier to put it all on than to dampen Mary 's enthusiastic cajoling . Martha would have liked to have had some peace and quiet , but Mary was there constantly  --  noisy and bubbling like an early-spring brook . She brushed a sheen into Martha 's hair and let it fall long and lustrous about Martha 's shoulders as the bridal tradition decreed . Then , taking two front sections of hair from  | the center part , Mary brought the strands to the back of Martha 's head and secured them with two gold combs . Skillfully her fingers moved precisely , and she wove tiny white flowers and fresh myrtle leaves into a fragrant wreath to crown Martha 's dark , rich head of hair . " You look as lovely as the rose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha looked down at her dress and had to admit she liked it in spite of her edgy feelings . It was made of snow-white , imported silk that had been taken off the finest bolt ever seen in her father 's shop . Martha had fashioned it into a dress , but Mary with the help of Judith , Bethany 's best seamstress , had inserted a breastplate of golden , woven fabric with an elaborate overwork of embroidered white flowers and tiny pearls . A gold sash completed the dress and matched the delicately made bridal sandals ; so except for her veil , she was ready . " At least I look like I 'm ready , " Martha ventured . She was still fidgety and concerned with her appearance , or was it just everything , when both girls heard the bridegroom 's procession clamoring outside and knew the time had arrived . Two young friends , Elizabeth and Vashti , came bounding unceremoniously through the doorway . " He 's here . Everyone is here . . . . " " Oh , Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in white , had been chosen along with Mary to serve Martha as bridal maidens , and their happy chattering reflected their high excitement over the honor . Impatiently Elizabeth and Vashti waited while Mary arranged Martha 's robin's-egg blue veil over her head and shoulders . Then with heads held high , they all escorted her to meet Benjamin . The girls passed the servants , who , approving , nodded and voiced their " ahs . " They walked through the throng of people to the place of honor . The beautiful Grecian chair , surrounded with huge bronze pots filled with flowering tree branches , stood alone at the end of the room waiting for the intended bride and her maidens .  | Martha sat there like a young queen waiting for her king . But even when her father , Josiah , kissed her forehead and whispered she was beautiful , it did not assuage her terror . Her feeling of ridiculousness was unparalleled to anything she had ever felt in her whole fourteen years of living . Benjamin 's eyes avoided hers . Even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' house in Jerusalem , they remained close to each other , but their eyes never met . Nothing it seemed , not even the extravagant ceremonial feast served to them under their special wedding canopy , the gifts lavished upon them , nor the lengthy blessings of the many toasts made to them complete with a heady , rich wine , could bridge their souls or entwine their hearts together . Later , when Martha had been led to the bridal chamber by Mary and the other maidens , she sent them away without accepting their help to undress , and motionlessly she sat on the couch . She had only hints of gossip , unwillingly overheard in the marketplace , to prepare her for the rigors of womanhood on this couch , and she absentmindedly traced the bedding 's design and patterns with her fingertips and fearfully considered the next hours . Martha smiled now in her dark place of dreaming and remembered how needless her fears had been . Benjamin  --  dear , gentle Benjamin  --  had finally come in to her , but so hesitantly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost instantly she warmed to him . He was not trembling from desire but from terror . With only a small glance at him to ease the moment , she unwound her veil and laid it aside . In the hazy glow of the small lamp above them , Benjamin perched nervously beside her , and his eyes were filled with quiet observation . When she had removed the tiny gold combs from her hair and the last of the wilted flower crown , he reached over and hesitatingly touched her rich , brown hair which cascaded around her shoulders . Its softness surprised him . It even gave him the courage to touch her face , but when he took her chin in his hands to speak to her , the smoothness of her skin and the deep , rich , brown of her eyes surprised him even more . He had never really  | looked at her before , but now  --  here , alone , and together  --  he found a loveliness which at once was as bewildering as it was wonderful . He wondered what other surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid that I shall , in some way , hurt you by this night , " Benjamin softly explained as he held Martha 's face gently in his hands . " I , ve no experience with a woman , he confessed , " and sometimes I am , well , you know  --  clumsy . " Martha took his hands from her face and wordlessly bent down before him . After she removed his sandals and her own she stood up , slipped off the dress with its golden sash , and carefully laid it and all her undergarments on a low bench . When nothing more hid her ivory-colored skin , she turned and faced him without shyness . He sat quite still , watching her with unconcealed wonderment . And when he said , " Martha , in our shop I have seen many beautiful things , but nothing will ever be as beautiful as what I have just witnessed , " she more than willingly stepped over to him and yielded herself to his arms . On their couch , in between their whispering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray I am not being clumsy . " She had never known or dreamed such delirious joy was obtainable for mere mortals of this world . As her body relinquished itself to his touch , Martha pressed her lips against his ear and rather fiercely whispered , " Oh , no , my love , you are not clumsy ! " Nor was he . Less than two new moons later ; the bubble of newly found , euphoric joyousness burst and shattered before her horrified , unbelieving eyes . Benjamin and her father had been standing on a busy street in Jerusalem 's bazaar talking with another merchant when a horse-drawn chariot , minus its Roman centurion driver , careened with the speed of a whirlwind , dragging , whirling , and scraping both her father and Benjamin to death under a fury of hooves and sharply spiked wheels . Sometimes Martha could still hear their screams , but at this moment all the space in her mind was filled with thick silence . " Oh , dear Adonai , am I seeing a vision ? Is this happening or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then with tenacity she struggled to surface up through the misty haze , but all that would come clear were the pictures in her mind of the mutilated bodies of her husband and father . Martha remembered they had lain very still as she washed and wrapped them that day . " Yes , as still as Lazarus today , " she whispered as she spiraled and slid backwards and downwards into her black , silent , and dreamless chamber . Nor did she awaken or feel herself being carried down the stairs in Joseph 's sturdy arms .  | MARTHA felt she had been sleeping for days , but when she awoke in her own room , she found she was still dressed in her dirty , stained dress . The nightmare of being awake flooded her mind with its very own special horror . Martha guessed by the sun 's low , afternoon pink glow that it had to be about the tenth hour . " Lazarus must be buried before sundown , or the decay will begin , " she said aloud as she raised herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door to her room opened , and Mary appeared with a basin of fresh water . Seeing that her sister was sitting up , she gave a small sigh of relief and said , " Oh , Martha , you have awakened . Good ! I was about to get you up as it is time to . . . . " Without finishing , Mary put the basin on a wooden chest , and then helped Martha up off the pallet and out of her tunic . Holding the garment away from her , Mary observed , " It is so crusted with soil , it could stand alone . " Then , with the tunic still at arm 's length , she hurried out the doorway . Martha washed and drew enormous strength and refreshment from the cool water . She dipped her towel in and out of the basin , letting its coolness bathe the fire out of her face , her body , and her soul . From the closet Martha found clean undergarments , her best black tunic , and her opaque black veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brought out from a drawer her dark maroon sash and tied it around her waist . When Martha surveyed her dress , she caught a glance of her hair in the polished bronze mirror and knew it was beyond even Mary 's help . Quickly she undid it and was giving it a hurried  | brushing when she heard a new commotion above the mourners ' wailing . Something was happening in the kitchen area . She could not tell what . Martha divided her hair in three sections and expertly plaited it into one thick braid . By the time she had wound the braid at the nape of her neck and secured it with several pins , Mary and Naomi , followed closely by Joseph , almost tumbled into her room . " What is it ? " she mumbled , still holding one pin in her mouth . " It 's the boys , Aaron and Jude . They have returned , " explained Mary . " Oh , good , " Martha said matter-of-factly as she put away her hairbrush and wiped up the remaining drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be here when we bury Lazarus , " Martha said and then became puzzled because she sensed something was amiss . " Why are you standing there ? Why are you not out meeting him ? Go fetch him ! He is our guest , " Martha charged . Sometimes their lack of hospitality was a deep thorn in her flesh . Stamped clearly on Martha 's mind was the memory of the large feast she had given for Jesus and his disciples . She had been well cautioned about her thoroughness in serving that night and yet she still maintained that nothing should disturb the common courtesies of hospitality . When none of them moved , Martha commanded , " Go and greet the Master as he comes . " " That is just the problem . " Mary shook her head as she spoke . " He is not here . He is . . . is not even coming . " " Not coming ? " Martha stared at her sister . " What do you mean  --  not coming ? " Without waiting for an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the short hall , toward the cooking area and called out loud and strong , " Aa-ron and Juu-de , come here ! " She need n't have yelled . They were standing in the middle of the room , their tired , dirty , and obviously tear-streaked faces turned up , awaiting Martha 's predictable scorn . That they had failed in their adventuresome mission was one thing ; to face Mistress Martha and explain was quite another .  | " Well ? " Martha bent over with hands on her hips and searched their faces . " We went up across the Jordan and into Perea as you told us , and we found the Master . Fatigue and fear raised Aaron 's voice a tone higher than usual . " We went to three villages before we found him ! " Jude offered as argument in their behalf , as they desperately wanted to please her . " Did you go to him straightway and give him my message ? " demanded Martha . " Yes , we did ! " It was Jude for the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples , many other men , and a whole group of Pharisees were all crowded in around him . We pushed through anyway and asked permission to speak with him . " " But did you give him my exact message ? " Martha questioned . " Yes , Mistress Martha , " Aaron bowed his head wearily . " I said , Master , the one you love is sick . ' " " Well ? " Martha pushed . " Mistress , Jesus did not say anything . He just sat down on a stone courtyard wall , bowed his head , and covered his face with his hands . " Then Jude picked up the story . " Andrew knelt down beside Jesus and said , Our friend Lazarus has been sickly since he was a babe . Will he die now ? ' ? " Yes , go on . What did the Master answer ? " Martha pressed impatiently and bent closer to catch each word . Aaron continued , " Ah , Jesus just looked up at Andrew , and then to all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unto death but for the glory of God . Then he stood up and said , so everyone could hear , I , the Son of God , will receive glory from this situation . ' Aaron 's shoulders squared a bit as he repeated Jesus ' words . " Oh , that is just fine ! " Martha fairly snorted . " Our brother is dead  --  not ailing , but dead  --  and Jesus says his illness will not end in death , but in glory ? " Her thoughts whirled within her . Jesus always talks in riddles  | and rhymes . I wish he would speak plainly . I wonder if I shall ever understand him . I do not know why he speaks as he does ! Returning her penetrating gaze to the boys , Martha prodded again . " What happened next ? " " Nothing , " Aaron gestured helplessly with his palms turned upward . " Nothing ? " exploded Martha . " Just like that ? Nothing ? Did he not give you a message for me or speak personally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . " Oh , " nodded Aaron , remembering . " He bade us eat and sent us on our way back , but he did not send any message or say if he would come at all . " Martha 's expression had not changed ; so Aaron added , " We did our best , Mistress Martha . " " I think it was Master Andrew , " Jude volunteered , " who asked Jesus if they would all come directly to Bethany , and Jesus just said , Not now . ' " Martha silently opened her mouth and formed the words " Not now ? " What does it all mean ? She shook her head as her exasperated thoughts kept coming . We love Jesus . He is our friend . We have asked nothing of him before . He is such a puzzling , mysterious friend , her thoughts surged on . He is godly and quite literally filled with heavenly power like the prophets of old . Yet he walks among us , eats with us , and is so amazingly human that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , aloud , to cover her hurt , Martha blurted , " He is such a mystery ! " Mary , still standing in the doorway , said softly , " My sister , our Lord must have his reasons . " Martha whirled around and , shaking her head at Mary , flung out , " Oh , yes , I am confident he has his reasons , but just try to make any sense out of it ! I wager even you , sweet Mary , can not figure why he has not come to aid us or comfort us in our sorrow ! " Martha 's words were seething with the fires which were burning inside her breast . Even as she spoke , Martha silently observed that the fires within her seemed to burn hotter and more frequently than ever before . It was a trait she did not like in herself . I seem to be angry from sunrise to sunset , she reflected , almost startling herself .  | She mentally shook herself free from the guilt of it , assuaging her soul by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be angry ! But still the fires and hurt did not ease or go away . The sound of the mourners ' weeping and wailing in the main room of the house returned Martha 's sense of priorities back into focus . Quickly she assumed her rightful leadership position and pushed down her heated thoughts and searing hurts . In spite of herself , her condition , and her frustration , Martha had the presence of mind to realize that the boys standing before her were tired , hungry , and still wearing their dirt-clogged sandals . Once again her high sense of hospitality won over her feelings . Almost roughly she steered Aaron and Jude to some wooden stools and began working loose the crusted leather straps of their sandals . When she handed their shoes to them , she said pleasantly , " There now , you go with Joseph and get washed . Aaron , wash that blister on your heel and rub it with oil . Then bind it up with a cloth . " To both boys , she continued , " After you 've changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi get you some barley soup and bread . I 'm sure you are both weary ; so after you 've eaten , you may take your rest . " She ruffled their hair and dismissed them with , " You did well and earned the rest . " Out the door they went , but Martha , catching Joseph 's arm , said , " One moment , please . " He stopped , turned , and faced her . " I just realized , we will have to rearrange the bodies in the tomb if there is to be sufficient room . We will have to use the ossuary . After you help the boys , I 'd like you to take several men , " she motioned her head toward the courtyard , " and transfer the remains of my mother from the stone bier to the ossuary . " Joseph nodded his head in understanding and knew what he must do , but he felt a flush of relief when he heard Martha add , " And I shall come with you . " Later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , Martha , Joseph , and several men left the house . The men carried the small carved stone ossuary box up the hill to the family tomb .  | Josiah Ben Jochanan 's tomb , or sepulcher , as some called it , was a private burial place befitting the distinguished family . It had been dug out of the rocks on the side of the hill . The stone covering the entrance was shaped roughly like a door . The stone cutters had left it naturally rounded on top , but it was flat on the bottom to keep it from rolling . They had chosen a rock deeper than a man 's arm in thickness . It took four of the strongest men in Bethany to move the massive stone aside . Martha smiled sadly in spite of her sorrow when she heard one man softly curse and say , " I think it would be easier to move two sleeping camels than this thing . " When the stone gave way to the men 's insistent pushing , Martha stood straight , with head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew would float out to fill her nostrils . The men stood mutely by the side of the entrance while Joseph took Martha 's arm , and the two of them entered the sepulcher . The inside of the tomb was exactly as she had remembered it : small and square in design with large hewed-out niches in the walls and two benches , one on either side of the entrance . The smaller wrapped figure on one bench was her mother ; on the other side , her father . As she stood looking at the bodies , Joseph left her for a moment , and when he came back , he and another man carried the ossuary inside . They set it down and carefully lifted off its heavy stone lid . " Which one ? " Joseph looked at Martha , not remembering . " My mother , " she said , pointing to the body . Then slowly the two men gathered the fragments of cloth and bones off the bench and with respect and tenderness , placed them in the ossuary . When the lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully placed it in one of the niches . With the bench ready for the newest body , Martha sighed , shook her head in resignation , and then walked back with the men to the house for Lazarus . It was a quick , silent trip down the street to her house . When they reached his room , Joseph and two men placed the wrapped and covered body of Lazarus on a narrow wooden  | frame which was latticed together by leather straps . Using this as his bier , they carried Lazarus out of his room . Mary joined them , and down the stairs they went , past many tearful faces , out into the courtyard . Then , with most of Bethany 's village people following close behind , the procession slowly made its way up the steep hill to the sepulcher . Martha and Mary , their black mourning veils securely over their heads and faces , walked arm in arm a few paces behind the bier . Their anguished tears ran unobserved and freely down their faces . They had always known this sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold hand of sorrow which tightly clutched their hearts . At the tomb there was no ceremony or burial ritual . Lazarus 's remains were simply placed on the prepared and waiting bench . The Rabbi Ben Isaiah offered a short , open eyed prayer ending with " Almighty Jehovah , give us understanding hearts and merciful wisdom in our time of deep sorrow . " The sisters bent over , touched his form to say their final good-byes , and then stepped out of the tomb without a backward glance . Joseph and several other men groaned and strained against the massive stone , but with a final heave , the stone settled into place . As the men dusted off their hands and clothes , it marked the end of the funeral and signaled the time for the villagers ' condolences to be voiced . Martha heard them ; yet she did n't . It was as if what they were saying was all muffled and subdued . What she could really hear , loud and clear , was her own overwhelming questions about Jesus . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late ? Why ? Hannah 's arm was around Martha 's shoulder . Dorcus had one of her arms ; Ruth , the other . All three women were saying all the comforting things one always says at times like this , but Martha shut them out and could only question , Why , why , why ? As the procession wound its way back down the hill , the rabbi pushed in between the women to take both Martha 's and Mary 's elbows in tow . " You know I am a Pharisee , " he said , over the crying and  | moaning of the mourners . Yes , the women automatically moved their heads up and down . " Then , you know I believe in personal immortality . I believe in the resurrection and that we shall see Lazarus again . " His voice had a funny kind of cheerfulness in it  --  almost as if he were saying the words so that he might be reassured . Martha peered out at him through the blackness of her veil . " You 'll see . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see him on Judgment Day , and the whole of Josiah Ben Jochanan 's family will be restored . " Neither Martha nor Mary responded . They simply walked along , each wrapped in her own cloak of confusion , aware only of the gaping holes in their lives because of their losses .  | SCREENING her face with her dark , heavy veil , Martha gave her full attention to the sand-colored cobblestones passing beneath her feet as she walked home . The rabbi continued his endless stream of comfort . " The psalmist has written , " he said , " Such a man will never be laid low , for the just shall be held in remembrance for ever . ' " Martha absently nodded and remembered a passage in Proverbs which reads , " The memory of the just is blessed : but the name of the wicked shall rot . " Our Lazarus was that just and righteous man , she thought , and his memory is blessed , but I shall never stop loving or missing him . She turned her attention back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no resurrection , then there 's no hope beyond this life . " Mary 's eyes , red-rimmed from weeping , met the rabbi 's gaze , and he continued , " A nation without hope , my child , is like a night without stars . And we do have hope , the blessed hope of eternal life . " He warmly encircled both women with his arms , and they continued their slow walk homeward . When the procession of mourners reached the last turn in the street , Martha lagged behind Mary and the rabbi and purposely slowed her gait , letting others pass , until she stood alone . The rabbi had picked up his one-sided discussion and was so absorbed in his own world of rhetoric involving his beliefs in the Judgment Day and the resurrection that he and Mary had almost reached the iron gates before he missed Martha .  | pink sunset and called , " Martha ? Come . " " In a moment , Rabbi . In a moment , " she answered . " Are you alright ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on . She was in absolutely no hurry to join them or even , for that matter , was she willing to listen to them as they consoled her . Desperately she wanted to deny this whole day , to put it out of her head so she would not have to deal with the painful , frustrating questions it had presented . Martha had stopped in a favorite spot . From where she was standing in the street , just after the last turn , she could look down a short distance and see Josiah Ben Jochanan 's magnificent house  --  her house , the house everyone called " Martha 's . " To her it was not Martha 's house , but the house of her father , and she never tired of the splendid sight . She stood alone as if she were a stranger to the area and watched the mourners moving by the front wall and entering through the intricately scrolled iron gates . Finally she gave her full attention to the stone dwelling beyond the gates and the people . The great house had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Josiah was both wealthy and well traveled , his home and furnishings reflected Roman , Greek , Hebrew , and even Assyrian cultures . In any case , the house was a far cry from any typical or common Palestinian residence . When Martha was little , she pretended their house was really a luxurious king 's palace and , indeed , to many of Bethany 's townsfolk , it was exactly that . The size of the stone buildings alone substantiated Martha 's pretending and the villagers ' surmising . Martha lifted her veil off her face and laid it on her head . By squinting her eyes she could block out people , plants , trees , and other distractions , to see the house more clearly . She stood lovingly taking in the great structure . Actually , her home was more like three stone houses than just one , she observed quietly to herself . The wide back building was two floors tall and flat roofed . Its  | windows were crisscrossed with delicately wrought wooden lattice work . She could see that the richly carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were making their way inside . Each day for several weeks the massive doors would be open as word of Lazarus 's death would travel over the countryside and mourners would come to pay their respects . Because Lazarus was so well loved , Martha knew any time alone with her grief would have to be postponed for a while . She returned her full attention to the house . The main back section , its white stone now a deep orange from the setting sun , was flanked on its eastern and western sides by single-storied buildings which jutted out toward the street , forming a deep center courtyard . Martha watched the people . They moved around the well in the courtyard , the trees , the shrubs , and on into the house , and she knew she could not linger too much longer . She would have to join them soon , but the sight of the house held her for a moment more . The house , outer walls , and gates were all bathed in the dusky glow of early twilight . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trees were abloom with spring 's first leaves , and here and there the masses of flowers against the black mourners ' robes and the cool , whitewashed stone house were like splashes of color on a tapestry . Dearly she loved the house and gardens . " Perhaps , " she said aloud , " I love this house because it is the one thing in my life which remains constant . It does not change , go away , or die . " " Martha ? " It was Hannah . She cupped her hand to her mouth and called from the gate , " Martha , you must come now . Everything is ready . " " Yes , I guess it would be , " Martha responded to herself . She called down to Hannah , " I 'll be right there . " She knew in the short time it took for the company of people to reach the sepulcher , bury Lazarus , and walk back home , busy hands would have gathered special dishes of food together for the mourning family and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the two women  | entered the main hall , Martha was not surprised to find everything attended to and definitely ready . What did surprise her was the manner in which she was treated . For suddenly Mary was at her side and both of them were escorted through the groups of people in the main hall of their own house as if they were honored guests or the governor of the feast . Some mourners were standing clustered about in groups . Others were moving quietly among the gathering of friends . Even as she walked , she inhaled the deliciously fragrant aromas of an abundance of prepared food . Here and there both sisters stopped briefly to say a word or two to the many friends assembled there . Martha 's cooking ability and sense of smell combined at one point , and she distinctly identified the scent of baked quail . She guessed the fowl had been given by Nathan and Anna who lived on the edge of Bethany . They took special pride in their assorted birds , and their success in keeping chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the perfect way Anna spit roasted them . Rebecca and Dorcus stood before the sisters with a basin and towel . Hannah guided them to a couch . Hesitantly , because usually in this house she was the hostess , Martha sat down gingerly beside Mary as Hannah and the others washed her feet . When that task was performed , Hannah led them from the great hall , through an archway , and into the long dining room on the eastern side of the house . Mary glanced at Martha and with a soft smile said discreetly , " One would think we did not know where the table is here in our own house . " " I was just thinking about that , " Martha replied . Between greetings and friendly but subdued salutations , Martha took in the large rectangular room with its dark sycamore-beamed ceiling , its gleaming white walls , and its highly polished table and noted with some degree of pleasure that the room was exactly as it should be . Everything was in order , and someone had done everything right  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall lamp stands were brimming with flaming oil , illuminating everything very well . The long , low table , surrounded by its reclining couches which looked like the  | spokes of a wheel , was crowded with food dishes . The food seemed to pick up its own special glow from the two candelabra wedged in between trays and plates on each end , and the sight made Martha ravenously hungry . There was such an abundance of food that someone had removed the bronze urn which usually graced the table as a centerpiece . Martha did n't have time to question its whereabouts as Hannah took her arm . Both Martha and Mary were led directly to the center couches of honor on both sides of the table . Martha felt an uncomfortable , almost foolish shiver run up her back as she settled down on the very couch she had led honored guests to during past evenings ' meals . Most homes in Bethany did not have a separate eating place . The people simply took their meals at small , low tables and sat on wooden stools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house boasted upholstered reclining couches , and long ago there had been a great deal of speculation in Bethany as to Josiah 's whys and wherefores of eating . Actually it was all quite simple to Josiah . He had made buying trips to many foreign cities and seaports . In the process , once on a trip to Rome , he had been befriended by a wealthy art merchant . Several times Julius Marcos had invited Josiah to take his evening meal with the Marcos family , but Josiah had always gracefully declined . Finally , Marcos 's persistent , kind invitation and Josiah 's own loneliness won out . Josiah swallowed his fears about the " barbarous " Romans and their nonkosher foods and gratefully , if not a bit apprehensively , accepted . He was pleasantly pleased to find that the shrewd businessman , Julius , was at home , a warm and gentle family man . He was quick to note that Julius understood his concern about Jewish dietary laws , for the food that was served was good , yet plain and very much in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pangs of guilt over his former inflexible attitude . Josiah was even more pleased when at the first dinner he found that affluent Romans ate in a separate room made just for eating , but he was almost joyous to find that they ate their meals at a triclinium . Josiah never stopped marveling about how nice it was to lie down on couches and eat !  | He had said to Martha after returning from the Rome trip , " You know , Martha , the Roman occupational army rules us and our land with an oppressive , heavy hand ; but we can learn from them in some ways . " Even though she was young , Martha had heard horror stories of Roman atrocities and torturing , and her prejudice and contempt for all Romans ran high within her . Disdainfully she asked , " What could Israel 's chosen people possibly learn from those heathen barbarians ? " " For one thing , " Josiah stroked his beard , " we could study their water system with its aqueducts , cisterns , and clay pipes and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Take their meals , Father ? " She had looked at him , her brown eyes popping with the wonder of how he knew of their ways . " Yes . . . take their meals , " he repeated . Then he told her all about the Marcos family , their dining area , and their couches . He had found that Roman women ate with the men , and Josiah liked that whole idea much better than the Jewish tradition of the women eating by themselves in the women 's quarters . " Just think of this , my daughter , " he gestured with his hands . " In the house of wealthy Romans , everyone takes his meals in a room dedicated to the purpose of eating . The table is low , and perpendicular to the table are the reclining benches or couches . You simply lie on the couch on your left side , head towards the table , and eat as usual with your right hand . It is both practical and pleasant ! " " Ah , yes . Practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fields , chewing away at their cuds , and that is exactly how they looked  --  practical and pleasant . " Martha smiled to herself as she remembered because here she sat on a couch in the very same room her father had designed for them . It was a Marcos room to her , and she had come to love it as her father had . This night they were using all the couches and had added as many stools as the room would allow so most everyone could eat together . The table talk was low , intimate , and friendly ; yet it was not  | easy for Martha to wholeheartedly enter into things . It was especially difficult to remember she was , at this feast , a guest . She looked across the table at Mary and admired the way her sister could open up her heart and mouth with such grace . Mary never seemed to have any trouble listening and aptly commenting . Tonight Mary was responding graciously to each person , and Martha was even more aware of her own stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serving with Tabitha and Leah than lying here all practical and pleasant , ' " she muttered to herself . When she had first smelled the luscious aroma of baked quail , she had been instantly hungry , but once at the table , she lost all desire to eat and absentmindedly picked at her food . Listlessly Martha took a bite of pale yellow cheese , dipped a crisp cucumber slice into the wine vinegar and oil bowl , noting its freshness , and even bit off a tasty bite of baked quail , but she had no appetite or incentive for eating . From the moment she had entered this room there was a growing apprehension about the whole evening . Unable to eat and feeling more edgy by the moment , Martha knew her mood was due to more than the fatiguing events of the past few days or the death of her loved one . For a while she concentrated on Mary 's lovely face and gracious manner , but imitating it was a futile gesture . Martha settled down on her couch and resigned herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Martha 's cup to refill it with wine that Martha snapped into alertness and was able to see what had been troubling her about this room . " Ah , besides my being a guest here in my own house , other things trouble me about this room , " she said to herself , and a trickle of energy ran through her veins . This room , this very couch , the food , the servants coming and going , the pouring of the wine . . . , her thoughts raced . This is the very place where I have served Jesus and his men . Tonight I am troubled  --  no , angry  --  that for all my times of serving Jesus , he did not come when I needed him . How often have I set plates of food before him , poured wine into his cup , and removed  | empty dishes from this table for him and his men ? she wondered . The memory , like a sharp needle , picked steadily at her . Where was he ? What had kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the questions surfaced and raised their ugly heads in her mind . The long meal , the first of the traditional thirty days of mourning , was friendly but without gaiety . It seemed to drag on endlessly like the dry heat of a summer drought . Once she inwardly admitted her source of anger , Martha rallied a little . She even managed several polite conversations and a somewhat hospitable countenance . When the final course was served and consumed and the last guest spoke his shalom of farewell , Martha heaved a grateful sigh of relief . They would be back in the morning , but for now Martha could mourn privately . She turned from the street and iron gates , and in the moonlight she said to Mary , " Let us go in and help the servants with the last of the cleaning up . Maybe that way we can all go to our pallets a little earlier tonight . " Without a word Mary moved from the gates , down the courtyard , and into the main doorway . There she stopped , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gently , Martha touched her arm , bringing her into the house , and shut the massive doors behind her . " Come , " Martha said affectionately . But Mary did not respond . She stood by the doors , head bowed , toying with the hem of her head veil . Martha looked down intently into Mary 's face and questioned , " Are you feeling ill , my sister ? " Mary 's answer was barely audible , and Martha leaned forward to hear . " No , I am not ill . I think I 'm just tired , or maybe , to be more honest , I am disappointed . I was so sure the Lord would come , " her voice trailed off into nothing . Martha felt she was gifted in making the best of every situation and most of her solutions to problems involved doing something ; so with the old vigor in her tone , she said , " Then , let 's help the servants . It will occupy our minds and our hands . "  | Martha was halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . She stopped , turned around , and with low-keyed deliberation in her voice , said sternly , " Mary , I am not only disappointed about Jesus , I am angry that he did not come , but it is over . Lazarus is gone . He rests in God 's arms tonight , and I pray he is no longer in pain . We must pick up the pieces of our lives . Now , come with me , and we will busy ourselves with the tasks at hand . " Still Mary did not move . She stood leaning against the main doors , totally absorbed in her own thoughts . Martha 's well of patience had never been too deep , but at this moment it ran bone-dry , and sharply she said , " Mary , I have gladly taken care of you , Lazarus , and this whole household . I have supervised the spring planting and the summer harvesting of our fields and vineyards . With Joseph 's help I have seen to the raising of our sheep and other livestock . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the housekeeping , or to work at some dreary task . It is beyond my comprehension that when I need you  --  really need you  --  you withdraw , or worse , you disappear , leaving me with the whole burden of the tasks at hand . Or , like now , when we both are confused and hurt by Jesus ' actions , we should pledge ourselves to tasks . Even simple ones would help to ease our troubled minds . " Martha did not expect or even wait for an answer . She turned on her heel and headed briskly for the cooking area . Mary could not see her sister go for the scalding tears which were streaming down her face , but still she did not move . Martha reached the cooking area , and it was dark except for the light of one small lamp . The neighbor women and servant girls had done their work remarkably well . Everyone was gone and everything , except for one basket , was in its proper place . Even by the light of the small hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in excellent order . She turned around and decided to give the dining room one final check before she retired . When she left the cooking area and padded silently across the carpets of the main hall to the dining room , Martha knew , before she looked , that Mary had gone to her room without bidding her  | a good night . Martha felt a twinge of guilt for the tartness of her tongue , but she quickly rationalized that it was not the first time Mary had failed to see to the tasks . Why should I expect anything else ? she wondered . My sister is not given to menial work or serving . Mary is gifted in singing , in needlework and embroidering , in listening and laughing , in just . . . , she searched for the elusive word . " Ah , in just being , " Martha finished aloud . I must be more tolerant with her , but she is so different from me . Martha 's thoughts continued until she reached the dining room . There were no lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small burning lamp from the great hall , returned and lit one of the large lamp stands in the corner . She stood looking at the long , low table and couches which were all illuminated by the lamp 's glow and said to herself , " My sister is like this room with its soft golden look  --  so alive to life . She is always being , ' whereas I seem to be always consumed by doing . ' " The tabletop shone because of someone 's careful polishing , and Martha noticed the large bronze urn was back in its place of honor between the two candelabra . It was in this room and at this very table , Martha remembered , she had learned firsthand about the vast difference between Mary 's creative " being " and her own inescapable urge toward " doing . " One evening , just at sunset , Martha and Mary had washed the feet of Jesus and seven of his men who accompanied him . Then , taking Jesus by the arm , Martha led him into the house and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest of honor . Both Mary and Martha escorted the group to their places at the table . It was not the first dinner they had taken together , but routinely Martha personally seated Jesus at the couch which was exactly midway in the long table . Each dinner she did that so everyone could see and hear him at the best advantage . Martha remembered how they all marveled at this man called Jesus from Nazareth . His looks completely startled her . They certainly caught her  | off guard the first time she saw him coming through her gates . It was as if she had seen him before in a dream or a vision , though she could not immediately tell why . He was irresistibly winsome and incredibly handsome of face . His skin , tanned and golden from the Galilean sun , was unblemished and his short , dark beard framed his symmetrical features with a manly grace . Jesus ' eyes were not the same bright azure blue of Mary 's but were of a softer , paler , grayer blue , given to subtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she first met him that Martha suddenly realized why she felt she had known or seen him before . Long ago , when she had been memorizing the psalms with Lazarus , she had pictured in her mind how the beautiful " comely " King David would have looked . Jesus , with his blue gray eyes , noble nose , and superb features , matched her mind 's image of David perfectly . It had given her chills when she finally put it all together . Everyone was attracted to him . Martha and Mary often discussed and agreed that it was the first glimpse at his fairness of face which arrested one 's attention , but it was definitely his penetrating way of returning one 's look that held and transfixed one . It was also Mary who first remarked on the faint circles under his eyes , which gave a look of sorrow to his face in spite of his comeliness . Noisy children became quiet around him and shyly crept close , simply to be near him . Children of soft-spoken natures took his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spontaneously giggled in noisy delight . Young people cocked their heads to sharpen their listening skills so they would not miss anything he said . And no one , old or young , was immune to his dramatic way of telling a story . " But always , " Martha had remarked to Mary as they were sewing one day , " there is the way Jesus looks at each person . " " Yes , " Mary had answered , " and I could easily lose myself in that gaze . " Jesus ' strong intelligence and straightforward honesty reminded  | Martha of her father ; yet his tenderness and ability to be creative were like the traits she saw and loved in Mary and Lazarus . Jesus , though tall and slim , was a man of unbending strength . His years at his father 's carpenter 's bench vigorously wielding the tools of his trade had toughened and strengthened the sinews and muscles of his limbs . But while he was iron strong , he seemed flexible and unhardened . He seemed stubbornly dedicated to principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bluntness of speech , the way he never wasted words , and his honest , truthful directness ; yet she was touched beyond belief by the utmost kindness which framed all his conversations . He was obviously filled with authority ; yet he was human , warm , and touchable . Martha always thought of him as the most whole and healthy man she had ever seen . It seemed to Martha that Jesus , teacher and rabbi , was a most complete man . When he was in her home , Martha found herself unable to do enough for him . She was skilled in serving , treating , and even healing others ; yet his presence in her house inspired her to unbelievable heights of giving and doing . Jesus ' slightest gesture or look was met by Martha 's immediate consideration , and off she would fly to fulfill his need . She could not put her finger on the exact reason for her desire to serve him , only that it was so . It was as if he had touched a responsive chord deep within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge . Whenever word reached her that Jesus was teaching in Jerusalem , she went into a flurry of frenzied activity , for she knew he would come for a visit . It was such a short walk from the temple courtyard in Jerusalem to her front gate that Jesus rarely spent his evening meal or night 's lodging any place but in Martha 's spacious house . It was an unspoken agreement between them , and it was these visits which deepened the loving friendship between Martha , Mary , Lazarus , and Jesus . With Jesus ' visits , Mary grew pensive and quiet . " It is as if , " she told Martha one night as they climbed the steps to the rooftop ,  | " I want to store everything in my heart . I dare not miss a thing he says or does . I have the feeling I will someday wish I had listened more . " Martha smiled in the darkness as they reached the roof , because if Jesus ' friendship made Mary quiet and reflective , it did just the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long debilitating effects of his lingering illness , would become suddenly alive with a restless stirring of life whenever Jesus was near . Martha called Jesus ' influence on Lazarus " a medicine which doeth good ! " So it was . Lazarus would find strength from somewhere and energetically begin to question Joseph about the sheep and goats , the barley fields , or worse , he would ask Martha what needed repairing in the house . Once when Jesus was there , Lazarus , in his usual short burst of good health , determined to fix the hinge on a small , priceless wooden cabinet . Jesus watched Lazarus struggling with the delicate bolts for as long as he could , then laughing and shaking his head he said , " Not only are you going to break the hinge even more than it is already , but you are attaching it upside down , and it may never work . " Lazarus picked up the pieces of hinge and the cabinet , and in a voice replying with mock seriousness , he laid it ceremoniously at Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have earned your master skills in carpentry ; so I bow to your abilities . " He would have said more , but both men were absorbed in their laughter . Martha had stood in the doorway quietly observing the deep , loving friendship which was forging together before her eyes . How good it was to hear her brother laugh , to see him try to do things , and to see him so much better , even if it were a temporary time of well-being . She understood well this burst of enthusiasm for life when Jesus was visiting , because it happened to her as well . Martha was always seized with pride that this gifted rabbi would make her home his choice , and her hospitality knew no limits . Nothing was too good or ever spared for Jesus and his men . The willingness to serve him was so strong in Martha that it overflowed to each person he had brought with him . She never  | knew exactly how many people it would be for the evening meal or how many floor mats for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the two or three years , did Jesus ever come alone . It was all an incredible challenge to Martha 's skill and sense of devotion to duty . She took to it like an experienced eagle soaring into tumultuous , stormy winds . The dinner she remembered the most was the one with Jesus , his seven men , and five hastily added neighbors . It was not one of the biggest groups she had served , but Naomi was ailing and both Deborah and Leah had been scalded by the boiling soup as they had lifted the pot from the fire ; so the work load was lying heavy on Martha 's shoulders . After seating Jesus and serving the first course of crackedwheat cakes and cucumbers which were dipped in the bowls of oil and vinegar , she had gone back to the cooking area to do what she could about salvaging what was left of the barley soup . To her relief , not much of it was gone although the girls , holding their burned hands in basins of cool water , were sure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martha called , looking past the girls and out to the back court . " Are you out there ? " There was no answer , and Leah ventured , " I think she is with the guests . " " I see , " said Martha as she poured the soup into a large bowl and carried it on a tray to the dining room . When she reached the room , she placed the tray on a small chest by the wall and wiped her hands on a towel as she looked for Mary . Martha almost missed her , because Mary was on the floor between the couches of Jesus and her gladdened brother . When she caught sight of the top of Mary 's red hair , she called out , " Mary ! " and instantly regretted the ugly impatience in her voice . Everyone fell silent as if her call had been not one voice but a flourish of trumpet blasts at the temple . Everyone turned to look at her , and some of them hid their smiles as they watched the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks . She was definitely obliged to explain ; so she stammered , " Ah ,  | excuse me , friends , honored guest , but . . . . " Then , looking directly at Jesus , she lamented , " Master , do you not care that my sister just sits here while I do all the work ? " She did not wait for an answer but plunged boldly on , " Tell her to come and help me . " If the room had quieted down before , when she had called out Mary 's name , it now was as if everyone had suddenly stopped breathing . Without sound , they waited for Jesus ' reply . No one missed his words or message , thought Martha ; no one but me , she remembered sadly . All she could recall of the moment was that there was no look of condemnation on his face and no threat in his tone of voice , but his answer mystified and confused her thoroughly . He said , " Martha , Martha , dear friend , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved his hand over the dishes before him . " There is really only one thing worth being concerned about . Mary has discovered it , and I wo n't take it away from her ! " The gentle friendship of his spirit reached out and touched her , but to Martha his frustrating remarks left her with precisely the same work load plus more questions . She looked at Jesus , and Mary , still seated beside him , shrugged her shoulders and mutely concentrated on picking up the vinegar and oil bowls to make room for the barley soup . Cold soup  --  by the time I get it served , Martha 's thoughts pronounced . Routinely she managed to get all the guests served without mishap , until she got to Andrew . There , between the table and Andrew 's couch , Martha 's foot caught itself in her robe , throwing her off balance , and every drop of lukewarm barley soup spread itself over Andrew 's head and robe . She was horrified at her clumsiness . " It 's alright , Martha , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In fact , it was n't hot ; so I 'm not burned  --  only wet . See ? " He was laughing and making the best of the situation . Martha groaned inwardly and then mumbled to Andrew , " Come with me . I 'll get you a clean tunic ! " They left amid the guests ' growing chorus of chuckling and  | laughter . No one could recall seeing Martha embarrassed in a year 's time , much less twice in one evening . Disgusted by the way the whole day had gone and her cheeks burning with indignation over her inept hospitality , Martha hurried out ahead of Andrew .  | THE friendship between Martha and Andrew began when they were much younger . How strange the pathways of God , Martha thought as she remembered how her family had traveled from Bethany to the distant seaport of Capernaum and had unexpectedly become acquainted with Andrew and Simon . Even stranger was her meeting up with Andrew after several years of silence , for they seemed to pick up the friendship exactly where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martha recalled , the trip to Capernaum was an exciting , adventuresome one , at least to her thinking . From Bethany they traveled by vast camel caravan northward , the way of the mountain , through the despised country of Samaria , and finally to Capernaum , which was located on the northern edge of the Sea of Galilee . It was a place of breathtaking beauty . Martha never stopped marveling at the glittering sea shaped like a harp . The lake itself looked like some of the rare jewelry pieces from her father 's shop  --  a bright opal surrounded by precious green emeralds . Everything at the sea of Galilee overflowed with a flood of sunshine . The natural perfume of the balmy air and the turtledoves of the surrounding hills and valleys breathed together in an exquisite tribute to Jehovah 's creativity . Once , when Mary was taking in all the beauty , she said , " Mother must have been exactly like this place  --  serene , yet alive and beautiful ! " Martha savored the observation each time they visited the enchanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest towns that circled the lake . It bustled in a maze of activity , not only because of its large fishing colony , but also because it was a frontier town for the great crossroads from Egypt to Damascus and from Acre to the Far East . Merchants , including Martha 's father , came from distant cities to avail themselves of the rich supply of goods . They filled Capernaum with their clamorous bargaining . Their presence made it an important commercial town , just as hundreds of fishermen made it a flourishing fishing port . Over the years , many lovely cashmeres , silks , and tapestries had been purchased here by Josiah , and his shop in Jerusalem had earned its reputation for exquisite and unique merchandise because of his buying trips to Capernaum . However , it was not for commercial reasons that Martha , Mary , and Lazarus made the long , arduous journey . Josiah had loved Rachel so much , he decided soon after her death that the best way to keep her memory alive was to take Martha , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's birth . So they made the pilgrimage to Capernaum once a year or as often as Josiah could arrange the time away from his shop . Martha and Mary always stood the rather exhausting trip better than their brother . However , once they got to their destination , viewed the shimmering blue Sea of Galilee , and were joyously received by their kinsfolk , everyone forgot the difficult trip . Even Lazarus 's color returned to his cheeks , and if he tired or felt ill , it was of little consequence . Nothing , it seemed , spoiled their joy . The children especially loved their mother 's exuberant sister , Miriam . Her quick laugh , together with her dark , dancing eyes , made her a delight to be around , and she lovingly fed the hungering needs of Martha and Mary with her warm , woman-to-woman talks . Privately , Josiah encouraged Miriam to spend as much time with them as she could . He never told her how his own heart fluttered and beat erratically each time he saw so much of Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead of becoming hardened and embittered about her barrenness , she opened her heart to everyone else 's children . It was natural then that her love for Rachel 's three could not be contained ; so it spilled out of her as a many splendored waterfall . It was also no wonder that they loved her in return . Miriam 's fisherman husband , their Uncle Judah , was cut from a different cloth , but once the children discovered the warm , giving heart he concealed by a stern countenance and a deep voice , they fell to loving him as well . While Mary was busily learning some new embroidery stitch from Aunt Miriam and Lazarus was over at the synagogue listening to Capernaum 's rabbi , Martha was usually down on the beach busily being Judah 's shadow . Doggedly she followed him , helped with the nets occasionally , and once or twice actually sailed with him . During one visit , when Martha had been about twelve years of age , she begged , pleaded , and cajoled her uncle to take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave in . " Enough of this pleading , child ! I do have a small bit of business with Jonas who fishes out of Bethsaida . So , instead of walking over there , we will go by boat . Will that suffice you ? " He playfully tapped the top of her head . Even though Martha knew the trip would be very short , since Bethsaida was the neighboring town just east of Capernaum , she fairly shouted , " Oh , yes , Uncle Judah , that would be very good ! " Then in case he changed his mind about sailing with a girl , she gathered up her skirt and waded out into the water toward the boat as fast as she could go . There were large colonies of fishermen all along the edge of the great sea , and on that particular sunny , cloudless day as they sailed to Bethsaida , Martha breathed in the fresh , damp sea air , let the sun wash her face with warmth , and listened attentively to all the calling and friendly greetings shouted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats . It was also on that day , after they arrived at Bethsaida , that Martha first saw and met Jonas and his two young sons .  | It was not that she would have missed them  --  what with her uncle pointing them out as he admonished , " Mark my words , Martha child , those sons of Jonas will be the best fishermen in all of this great sea one day . They , like their father , are shrewd about the fickle ways of the water , and they have a God-given natural talent for knowing where the fish spend their mornings . " Judah threw a rope to one of the boys , and the young man deftly caught it , pulled it in , and beached the boat on the hard , white sand . Clearly , when her uncle was with his fishing friends , he was transformed from the quiet , almost grave man she knew to an outspoken man in familiar territory . Martha watched him in amazement . Between gaily shouted greetings and humorous remarks with other fishermen , Judah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Miriam 's kinsfolk from the south , and her name is Martha . " Noting that she was a girl , the taller of the two sons teased , " Does she sail well , Judah ? " " Well , considering it took us many long days on this voyage , yes , I 'd say she sails surprisingly well , " he winked at the boy as he exaggerated their trip . Then to Martha he said good-naturedly , " This is Simon , the oldest . Do not mind his flapping mouth . Simon is like this sea , " Judah said pointing toward the rippling water , " with a capricious temperament all his own . " She was clutching up her skirts when Simon rather awkwardly helped her from the boat . More accurately , he jerked her out , but Martha was impressed by his strength . He was very tall , rawboned , and trim . He was bare from the waist up , and she could see the muscles under the skin of his wet arms and shoulders rippling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys , because even though she was just meeting them , she could clearly see Simon 's physical strength , and she liked the way he took charge of things . . . and this is Simon 's brother , Andrew , " Judah was saying .  | Martha turned and looked up directly into the second boy 's brown eyes . He smiled , and so did she , but neither of them said anything . Martha liked him better than his brother , though she could not tell why . Andrew was not quite as tall as Simon but built as slim and with the same powerful chest and arms . Both boys had a head of hair a few shades darker red than Mary 's , and while neither of them could be considered handsome , Martha had to admit they were striking and bore watching . Toward the end of their visits to Capernaum , before their father 's death , Martha , Mary , and Lazarus all enjoyed and deepened their friendship with Andrew and Simon . Martha never warmed completely to Simon 's teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer she grew to know him , she learned to move out of his way quickly when things went wrong . His temper was instantaneous and the heated oaths he bellowed were known to scorch people 's ears . " Simon 's voice can be ear rending ! " Martha had warned Mary . But his dedication to fishing was obvious , and because of his skill , he drew the admiration of the other fishermen . Simon , she agreed with her Uncle Judah , was a young man to reckon with , even if he was not to her liking . With Andrew it was a different story . At first he said almost nothing directly to Martha , but later they slipped into a quiet , casual relationship , for they found they could be friends with just a few words spoken between them . It was Andrew who recognized Martha 's skilled and agile fingers one day as he watched her at Miriam 's weaving loom . So , without much talk between them , he set about to teach her the fisherman 's ancient art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became almost as fast as he was . Their unique friendship solidified near the nets and the barrels of salted fish on the warm , sunny edge of the sea . The family stopped going to Capernaum after the deaths of their father and Martha 's husband , Benjamin , and except for news passed from one caravan to another , Martha lost track of Jonas 's sons of Bethsaida.  | She was stunned one day to learn from a trader that Andrew , from all reports , had left Bethsaida and had gone off to follow the strange , new prophet named John . For no particular reason , she wondered if Andrew had married and then answered her own question by remembering he was a good Jew , even devout , and so naturally he would have taken a wife by now . But Andrew was so good at fishing and preserving the fish with salt that Martha could not imagine him away from his boats , nets , and his beloved sea . Yet , apparently the wild man from the desert had been most impressive . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom weaving some flax into linen cloth , Mary had burst in the room saying , " Come look who is at our front gate , Martha . You 'll not believe it ! " and without saying anything else Mary turned and flew out the doorway like a darting sparrow . Martha got up quickly and almost knocked over her loom . Running closely after Mary , both women reached the gate and heard the man quietly ask , " May I come in , old friends ? " " Andrew ! Is it really you ? " Martha asked , shading her eyes from the sunlight and searching his face intently . " Yes , Martha , it is I. Now , may I come in ? " " Oh , forgive me , " Martha cried , and hurriedly she and Mary pulled open the gate . They went inside amid the confusion of them asking questions of him . " Wait ! " shouted Martha , holding her hand up to get their attention . " Let 's get Lazarus down here , and after we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all calmly ask questions , and you can answer . " She looked up at Andrew , and then stepped over closer to him for a better look . " You must be weary , and you 've probably not eaten today . " He nodded , and they knew what she had said was true . However , barely after they started to eat dinner , they could hold their questions no longer ; so Lazarus began . He asked of Andrew 's father , Jonas . " He is dead , " Andrew answered simply . " So is ours , " echoed back Lazarus . The room grew momentarily hushed.  | " What of Simon ? " asked Mary , hoping the conversation would lighten . " Ah , that is why I 've come . I want to tell you about Simon . " He hesitated ever so slightly , and Mary looked intently across the table to read his face better . " Well , what I want to know , " interrupted Martha as she rushed in with a forgotten tray of dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about the rumor we heard of your running off with a prophet ! Surely this is not true ! " " Dear outspoken Martha , " said Andrew , chuckling softly . " I am not with John now , " he said . " Ah , " said Martha knowingly . " When I heard you had gone with him , I knew it would not be for long . You are too good a fisherman to leave your work . " Rushing on , she confidently continued . " Then , too , the sons of Jonas have built quite a name for themselves in the fishing colony up there , and I just knew you could n't leave it forever , " she finished , proud of her accuracy . " That 's just it , though . It 's what I want to tell you all . I have left my fishing ; so has Simon . We do not fish for fish anymore . . . . " He stopped talking to let the words sink in . Then he continued . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many changes I have experienced recently . " His voice grew husky , and for a moment he cleared his throat noisily . " Even the man I followed is gone . John the Baptist was arrested by Herod Antipas , imprisoned in the underground vaults , and . . . . " Andrew bowed his head until he was able to go on . " He died a hideous death , one I can not yet speak of . . . . " Down went his head , so they would not view the depths of his anguish . They sat stiff and silent around the table until Mary roused herself and , leaning over , touched Andrew 's arm , saying , " Tell us then , Andrew , from the beginning , so we may understand . " " I would like to very much . " Andrew 's voice softened and filled with a comfortable love . " But I am not sure you will understand . Some of this I do not understand myself , but the old bonds of friendship run deep between us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray you will see what I 'm doing is what I must . "  | " Proceed , please , " Martha urged . " I hesitate to begin it , because when I left Bethsaida to follow John , it seemed such an accidental thing . Yet what it led to was not a chance happening or a whim of fate . " Everyone in Bethsaida and Capernaum talked about the teachings and prophesying of this man called John . When I found he was preaching down by the city of Magdala , I thought I 'd go and see the man for myself . " So another fisherman , John , the son of Zebedee , and I went to see this man they called John the Baptist . " " We have heard of him , too , " put in Mary , " and he sounded so strange . . . living in the desert . . . . " " Eating locusts and wild honey . Is that true , Andrew ? " Martha , always concerned with what to serve for dinner , needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw him for myself , I can not tell you how deeply he stirred my soul . " " Was he not wild then ? " Martha asked , but Lazarus 's glance silenced her . Andrew continued . " He was like no man we have ever seen  --  bursting with rugged health , strong , and intense of vision . He was impetuous and full of fire . I thought of him as a young Elijah , ready to penetrate the people 's hearts and minds with his incredible message . Why he was put to death and by what evil intentions burns in my soul even now . " Martha marveled at Andrew 's way with words . Whatever this prophet John had done , at least he had loosened Andrew 's tongue , and his words streamed eloquently on . She listened intently now . " The prophet had a special kind of grace about him . You could see it in his humility and his holylike courage . His selfdenial and abstinence were so great , many people thought him possessed and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend John and I wanted to know him better . " " You did not think him , at least , strange ? " questioned Lazarus gently . " At first we did , but then we listened to his words . I confess , when he prophesied about the man who was to come , we believed  | him . It did not matter that John looked strange or lived in a way different from mine . We both felt the man spoke the truth and spoke it as no other man ever had . " Eventually the lamps were lit , and they eagerly lingered around the table listening to Andrew as he told of how John and he had left their fishing to go off with John the Baptist to be his followers . " I intended to return to fishing after a few weeks or months of serving with the prophet , but somehow , as the work grew , I continued on . " " We , in Bethany , heard that this John the Baptist predicted the Messiah 's return . Is this what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , trying to recall her religious classes with Lazarus and the rabbi . " Yes , and I especially believed the prophet one day in the other village of Bethany , you know , the one across the Jordan River ? " They nodded their heads in accord . " Well , " Andrew leaned forward as he spoke , " I believed it because as John was baptizing some people in the river , he suddenly stopped and pointed to a man who was walking down the hill through the trees toward the riverbank . " John seemed to be transfixed in the water . Then , as he pointed to the man , he cried out , Behold the Lamb of God ! ' He proceeded to tell everyone this man would take away the sins of the world . His voice was blazing with the fire of knowledge and authority . " I was standing close to the water 's edge when the man waded into the water right in front of me . For a moment he looked at me , and I stood face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then John baptized him . " " Did you speak to this Jesus ? " Mary asked intently . " No , not then , for my courage failed me . But the next day while my friend John , Zebedee 's son , and I were talking with John the Baptist , Jesus walked through the small group of people gathered to hear the prophet , and the same thing happened . " John turned and again , in a loud voice , declared , There is  | the Lamb of God ' as he pointed to Jesus . " I can not explain it , " continued Andrew , shaking his head , as if to clear it , " but at that moment both John and I knew we would leave John the Baptist and become Jesus ' followers instead . " We watched Jesus walk away after John had pointed him out again , and while we did not know where he was going , we pursued him anyway . " Jesus must have known we were behind him , because presently he turned and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us knew precisely , and we were both timid in his awesome presence . But we wanted to be with him ; so we asked where he was staying . He bid us come , and we went with him . For several hours we just sat listening . " " Whose house was he staying in ? " Martha questioned . " No one 's , " he answered . " It was just a temporary booth , like the common people put up , with sides made of woven green branches of terebinth and palm and the top covered with a striped cloth . But to us , because he was there , it seemed the perfect place to be . " I tell you , " here Andrew leaned toward them , his eyes blazing with a fiery dedication , " before John and I closed our eyes that night , we felt in our innermost hearts , because of what we had heard that afternoon , that the Kingdom of Heaven had come . We felt we had been in the presence of him who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a king greater than David ! " " Andrew , " Martha 's voice exclaimed , " from our childhood I remember you as reticent to utter three words together at one time ; yet here you are speaking to us as we have rarely heard anyone speak . You are so changed ! " Martha 's words summed up Lazarus 's and Mary 's thoughts completely . " I am unaware of my speech changes , Martha , " Andrew said as he smiled broadly . " But you are right about my changing . I am changed , and it all happened once I 'd seen the Nazarene . " In fact , John and I were both so changed by Jesus that the very next day , at John the Baptist 's urging , we decided to leave  | the Baptist and learn everything we could from Jesus. - " We left the Jordan River and returned to Bethsaida to tell Simon and our kinsfolk of our decisions . I was bursting to tell Simon that we had found the promised Messiah . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King ? " Lazarus asked , his voice cracking with astonishment . " No , not might be  --  is the King ! " Andrew thundered . Martha spoke . " Ah , I would imagine , knowing Simon , that he would have none of your story . " " That 's exactly right , Martha . There I was , full of the enthusiasm of a zealot since I had just been face to face with the true , living Messiah , and Simon , who had been into the wineskins a little too much , just yelled , Get into the boat . We 've got a lot of fishing to make up because of your religious wandering . ' " " With Simon 's tongue , I 'm sure he said a lot more than that , " muttered Martha , just under her breath . " Andrew , please continue , " Mary said , dismissing Martha 's quip . " Well , there was nothing I could do but go with my brother Simon to the boats . He is persuasive , that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets , I told him about the prophet John , the baptizing at the Jordan , and my time with Jesus , but Simon just worked fast and furiously on the nets . He called me a madman , among other things . " Then , while we were still mending the nets , arguing and shouting at one another , someone called out to us . We both looked up , and to my surprise I recognized Jesus . He cupped his hand to his mouth and called out , Come along with me , and I will show you how to fish for the souls of men ! ' Simon stared at Jesus and his great mouth dropped open and stayed that way . " Jesus ' voice was sure and strong . It had an almost musical quality to it , but clearly it was a commanding clarion call . Yet it was warm with joy . Even now shivers run down my back with just the remembering ! " What struck me the most about Jesus ' voice was the certain sound of hope . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths  | of my soul . It was a sound I 've longed to hear all my life . Think of it  --  hope in these ugly times . " Andrew grew distant for a moment , and with the memory his face softened in the lamplight . Then he picked up his story , " All the fishermen in the boats that day and the children playing on the shore heard the call of Jesus . Yet , it was almost funny , for it was my brother Simon , who , without my identifying Jesus , dropped his nets as if they were a handful of poisonous snakes and immediately leaped over the boat 's edge . He landed in the water , waded to shore , and ran over to Jesus without a question . " I had to run to catch up with him . I could see Jesus laughing and shaking his head at Simon 's impetuousness . But when we finally stood before him , Jesus ' eyes and face sobered , and he looked deep into our souls with his royal gaze . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he looked intently at Simon . It was as if , in just a glance , he could see the man before him as a fisherman , good at his trade but with certain flaws and weaknesses ; yet he seemed to see something in Simon we had never seen . Jesus and Simon stared at each other , their eyes locked together in an intense soul-searching confrontation . When he finally spoke , Jesus said with great authority , You are Simon , Jonas 's son , but from now on you shall be called Peter , the rock . ' Simon , though he was a head taller than Jesus , seemed to shrink in size under Jesus ' quiet pronouncement . " We left our boats , our nets , our families , and our livelihood . We cut them out as quickly as if we were cleaning a fish with a sharp knife . " I had never done anything so extraordinary or so decisive before . For some time after , I found it hard to draw my breath , and my heart pounded within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " You have left a wife and perhaps sons and daughters ? " No one noticed that Martha 's shoulders straightened or that she ever so slightly leaned forward . " No , I have not married . " Martha 's mouth relaxed , and a tiny smile appeared . " Peter is married , and our leaving created quite a furor . He said he would be back , but Anna , his wife , and Sarah , his  | mother-in-law , wagered that he 'd never return . There was bad blood between them , and I left Capernaum relieved that I had not yet found a helpmate . " " Still , you picked up and left everything ? " asked Lazarus . " Yes , my friend , because then , as now , I believed John the Baptist 's testimony and his prophetic words , and I believe Jesus , the man , himself . I could do nothing but give myself to him . " " What else happened the day you left your nets ? " Mary was eager to hear all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , rubbing his eyes . " We walked up the beach a little farther , and though the shores were crowded with men , children , boats , and fishing tools , Jesus went directly to the boats of Zebedee . The old man oversees all the exporting of salt-packed fish , and he and his sons are very wealthy because of their trade skills . Zebedee 's two sons were repairing some wooden kegs when Jesus came toward them and greeted John whom he had met when we were with John the Baptist . Then he looked at the other son , James , and said quite simply , James and John , follow me . ' " I thought old Zebedee 's eyes would burst and fall out of his head , because both his sons turned from Jesus and , facing their father , thanked him courteously for their home and their loving memories . Then they embraced him warmly and said their farewells , leaving Zebedee wild-eyed and ranting with angry questions about who would run their exporting business . " " Zebedee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his success is due in part to his skilled sons . You mean they climbed out of the boat , just like that ? " Martha was incredulous ; her face a mask of questioning frowns . " Yes , just like the rest of us , " Andrew answered . " How many more are there of you ' ? " Lazarus wanted to know . " Besides Peter and myself , there 're Zebedee 's sons , James and John ; another fisherman , Philip ; and his friend , Nathanael . But not all have left their nets . One was a tax collector , another was a revolutionary , and there are several more . " " Andrew ! " Martha 's astounded shout split the air . " You  | mean you are with a group of men , disciples if you please , and one of them is a tax collector ? " Andrew cleared his throat . " I said he was a tax collector . His name is now Matthew , but you may remember him as Levi . " " Not Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same , " Andrew answered matter-of-factly . " But , " now Martha was sputtering , " but he is the worst tax scoundrel anywhere . You know he worked hand in glove with the Romans . I remember my father 's hatred for him , and he spoke of Levi as a traitor ! " Rushing on , she continued , " Then there 's the tax collectors ' greedy practice of squeezing out a profit for themselves over and above what the Romans demand . Levi , more than all his evil henchmen , sucked the blood of decent hardworking people . Moreover , " and now her words were scalding , but her voice was low and filled with contemptuous scorn , " he collects taxes from prostitutes , and I 'm sure he and other collectors take their money out in trade . " They are not decent men but unclean and to be with one , much less Levi or Matthew or whatever he is called now , renders you unclean ! " " Martha , " Andrew said wearily , " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one now . Matthew has left his collection boxes , his hoard of silver shekels , and even his two slaves who protected him . He is a disciple of Jesus now , as I am . He has put his old life behind him . " " Like you left fishing ? " Mary understood . " Yes . Like I left fishing , " he nodded . Then , as if Martha should know the rest as well , he said to her , " There 's more . We even ate in Levi 's house . Jesus , Peter , James , John , and I. Present also were men of dubious , possibly criminal , professions , and women of obvious ill repute . " Martha gasped and then glared at him . Mary sat in total silence , not daring to believe what she heard . Finally Martha collected herself to ask , " Whose idea was it . . . to eat with him ? " " Jesus ' . " Andrew got up from the couch and table and slowly paced the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to gather his chosen people . "  | Martha could sense his desperate sincerity ; so she made a willful effort to understand . Andrew continued , " I know it is hard to grasp , but Jesus has come for sinners , obnoxious publicans , Samaritans , and possibly even the Romans . " The two sisters pulled back in genuine horror ; so he said , " It 's true . Once Jesus said , ' If anyone wants to be a follower of mine , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me . ' He did not say only devout , pious Jews ' but clearly told us any man could follow him . " Martha , " and now Andrew sat down across the table from her , " Jesus has even taught us that the saying Love your friends and hate your enemies ' is wrong . He told us to love our enemies and to do good to anyone who hates us . " " Even tax men and Romans ? " queried Lazarus . " Yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those who persecute us . " " It is a hard lesson to learn , and most of us will be unteachable . " Martha spoke harshly . " I agree , my friend , " Andrew said patting Martha 's arm in a tender gesture , " but even so , I believe Jesus of Nazareth , the carpenter 's son , is the one foretold by past and present prophets to be our Deliverer . " I admit he and his teachings puzzle me , but over and over again my heart confirms deep inside of me that he is who he says he is . " Andrew 's voice grew tight with excitement as he talked on . " I tell you , this Jesus , this humble man , is the true Messiah , the Saviour of the world . I am not merely a follower , but a student  --  no , a disciple  --  and I am to be part of his kingdom . " " His kingdom ? " they chorused together . " He is setting up his kingdom ? " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jerusalem , or any place in all of Judea , he will need several legions of armed men to overthrow the Romans ! " said Martha , her mind functioning in its usual , practical manner . " How many disciples like you are there in all , Andrew ? " Martha pressed .  | He answered quietly . " Only twelve , but while I know it does not sound like much , I know we will add to our numbers soon . Why , even now , there are growing numbers of believers , and each day the Master 's miracles and fame increase . " " But to set up a kingdom . . . , " Martha 's voice trailed off . Then she said matter-of-factly , " From what you told us , Andrew , about this Jesus , if he truly is the awaited Messiah , he will have to do a very thorough job of organizing his plans and recruiting men for his kingdom and cause , or the Romans will crush him and put an end to him before he even gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like eating with men and women of unsavory reputations , he will get into all kinds of trouble . He sounds to me like a man who continually does things he 's not supposed to do and says things he 's not supposed to say . " All but Andrew nodded their heads in agreement . From twilight to darkest night and on into the early hours of the dawn , they carried their strange conversation , but for Josiah Ben Jochanan 's son and two daughters , the stories of Jesus were to forever alter their lives . Only a few days later Andrew appeared at their gate again , and Martha , ever hospitable , bid him to come inside . " No , my dear Martha , not right now , for I must hurry back to the others , but I want you to meet Jesus for yourself . " He is teaching in the temple . Could I impose on you for the evening meal and tonight 's lodging ? " Andrew asked . Martha , afraid of offending Andrew , had hesitated only momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening 's meal and one night 's lodging , but in the years that followed , the one meal stretched into many , and the one night 's lodging became an accepted routine procedure . Up until the time she met Jesus , she had never quite known what to do with her magnificent house on the hill , but at their first meeting she not only abandoned her preconceived notions about him but caught an extraordinary vision of what her home could do for him . From the first moment she saw Jesus standing at her front gate with Andrew and the others , she secretly dedicated her house as  | a place for teaching , resting , and certainly providing food and refreshment for him . It was exactly as Simon had simply climbed out of the boat , leaving his former life behind to follow Jesus . Her decision was impulsive , made without too much thought , but something greater than herself impelled her , and she knew she would make her house  --  his house . Martha scrutinized Jesus with a careful eye and marveled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , ordinary way of men . To protect himself from the searing heat of the sun , he wore the simple white kaffiyeh covering his hair . It was fastened in the usual way by an agal around the top of his head . She warmed to Jesus ' humility when she saw he did not wear the white ephod of the Levite or the rich sweeping robes of the scribes , but the long simple blue tallith . It covered his entire person and showed only occasional glimpses of the coarse woolen tunic of striped design and waist girdle underneath . Nor did he wear on his arm and forehead the tefillin which the Pharisees made so broad . In fact , even the blue ribbon and fringe at the hem of his tallith , which the law required , was not wide or paraded about to show prideful religious obedience . It simply ran the hem of his garment like the fine , discreet line of understated royalty . Even his leather sandals are like everyone else 's , Martha thought , as Jesus came through the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments did not disguise him . Definitely , Jesus was a king . As if to confirm her feelings , she watched him and realized Jesus ' walk verified his majesty , for he moved , not with a selfappointed haughtiness , but with a natural nobleness and with a distinct touch of grace . Over the seasons and the years , Martha had tried to describe his facial features , but each attempt ended futilely . No one , it seemed , could draw the same picture . He was to everyone , a different countenance . It was finally John who gave the most accurate portrait of his face when he said , years later , " . . . the Word became man and lived for a time among us , and we viewed His glory . "  | The night of the dinner party when she had shouted Mary 's name , heard Jesus ' puzzling comments , and spilled barley soup all over Andrew , Martha had been more tired than she admitted . As she rushed ahead of Andrew to fetch a clean tunic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond her limits . It does so impair my judgment , she scolded herself . Andrew 's long-legged strides kept up with her hurried trot , but when they reached the cooking area , he grabbed her arm and said , " In the name of hospitality and my good health , wait , Martha , wait ! " " Oh , Andrew , I try so hard , and yet I seem to have no wisdom at all . At least I do not seem to understand the Master sometimes . He speaks in riddles and stories always . " She rummaged through a large cupboard for a clean tunic . " I 'm sorry I blurted out Mary 's name and asked Jesus to tell her to help me , but it does no good at all if I ask her . " She found the right robe and handed it to Andrew . He caught her hand with the robe , held it steady , and said , " I know , Martha , and I do understand . " She quieted under his gaze and softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is he displeased with me for doing the thing I do best  --  serving ? It is the only thing I can give to him . Is it wrong to serve , or to need help and seek Mary to share the work load ? Oh , I wish I knew . " " Dear Martha , Jesus was not reproving you . At least , if it were a reproof , it was the gentlest , most tender one I 've ever heard . No , nor was he scolding you . I feel his words did not demean the work you undertook in his behalf ; only he wanted you to put down your anxious spirit of fretting and fussing . " " But , Andrew , we can not all take our leave of work . Who would feed all those men out there ? And how could we all sit in composure at his feet like Mary ? " " Martha , when have you ever sat at his feet ? " Andrew 's words stunned her mind as if she had just stepped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the uplands . " I , I have never taken the time . There always seems to be so much to do , " she stammered .  | She was rubbing her eyes when she heard , " That is the essence of what I meant , Martha . " She whirled around to look directly into the face of Jesus . His physical presence in the cooking area astounded her . She stared at him as he continued . He was smiling and seemed completely at ease among the trays of food , baskets , and cooking ware . When Jesus spoke , Martha was captured by the soothing , gracious warmth of his words . " Martha , you have ' always served me and many others with an eager openheartedness . Never have you failed anyone in doing things , but you have lost your fine sense of priorities . You 've become overtired , fretful ; so much so that serving and doing have consumed you and taken their toll of you . " He took her chin in his hands , and the small gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martha , Martha , " he said as Andrew stood watching , " I want to see a balance between doing and being in your life . You need to learn when it is time to stop your industrious serving and quiet yourself for listening and storing food for your soul . Did you know that the soul must be fed its supper too ? " As he stood before her , Martha 's mind was filled with the portion of a psalm she learned so long ago . The words splashed across her soul like the first refreshing rain of spring : Be still , and know that I am God . I am exalted among the nations , I am exalted in the earth ! Ah , Martha said to herself , being still is what Mary chose . The " being " is the better part of " doing . " How could I have been so caught up in the serving  --  the doing ? she puzzled . " Master , " she said , " I shall not forget this moment . " " Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looked at her for a moment more , he took one finger and carefully wiped away the streams of tears on her cheeks . There and then , amid the earthy smells of leeks , garlic , and crusty roasted lamb , both Martha and Andrew felt the holy  | majesty of his presence as it slowly filled the room with its fragrance of unlimited love and awesome beauty . They grew silent with the wonder of it all . They were so overcome with his splendor that they were never able to speak of the moment thereafter .  | THE question was never : " Will he die ? " It was always : " When ? " Lazarus was dead now four days , Martha pondered her dark thoughts as she climbed the stairs to look into his vacant chamber . She stood resting her head against the doorpost and wondered how it went with the dead after four days . Not finding an answer , she sighed and started downstairs to take her morning meal . She tried valiantly to ignore the tentacles of grief which squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowing hard , straightening up her shoulders , and carrying her head high , she could give at least the appearance of wholeness . Slowly she walked down the steps , across the main chamber , and opened the front doors . They saw her just moments before she saw them . The mourners had gathered earlier and were quietly assembled by the outer ' gates , just talking and waiting . Martha hailed them , briskly walked through the courtyard gardens , and bid them a somewhat delayed welcome . Word of Lazarus 's death had spread unusually fast as Jerusalem was within easy walking distance . Even though Martha 's father was gone , Josiah 's wealth and business abilities were known and remembered by many . The death , funeral , and time of mourning for Josiah 's only son attracted a large concourse of distinguished Jews , and Martha took note of them all with some satisfaction . They came now in great numbers and waited patiently to be received by the sisters . Some came in loving sadness , others out  | of curiosity , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customs of solace . As Martha walked back into the house with the day 's first mourners , she ran into Mary and exchanged good mornings . " Have you eaten ? " Martha mouthed the words silently toward Mary over the head of Simon , their neighbor . " Yes . I awakened early . You go get something . I 'll stay here with the guests . " Mary gestured her head towards the cooking area . Martha gave a grateful smile to Mary , excused herself from the guests , and hurriedly left them to her sister 's gracious hospitality . Even before Martha reached the door , Mary had engaged many of them in conversation . That sister of mine could charm a marble statue into carrying on a pleasant conversation , she thought , and a quick smile flashed across Martha 's face . In the cooking room Naomi was adding her finishing touches to her hearty corn porridge . She was bending over the pot , gingerly tasting the steaming mixture to see if the salt and water portions were correct and up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha winked at Naomi in an attempt to be humorous and gave the old woman a quick pat on her shoulders . Naomi had been deep in thought , and Martha 's words startled her , but she recovered quickly and retorted , " Certainly ! Would it be any other way ? " The two women 's eyes met , but all the fun and pretense fell away , and the sadness which both women were enduring surged between them . " I know , dear Naomi . We all shall miss Lazarus . It does not seem right that such a gentle man is gone , . but . . . he is . " Words about him were impossible for Naomi ; so she bustled about and with considerable effort returned to teasing and said , " Now , if my porridge is not to your satisfaction , I have some pomegranates and dried dates which might suit you better . " She ladled out the hot porridge into a deep pottery cup , and the corners of her mouth turned up into a pleasant smile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed Martha as the fresh morning air had earher ,  | and she relaxed as she sat on a low stool , eating and talking with Naomi . With a good night 's rest behind her to clear out the cobwebs from her mind , she realized she had taken the work of Naomi and the others for granted in the past weeks . " Naomi , " Martha said quietly , " I have been so preoccupied with the events of the past few days and so weary with my brother 's illness , I fear I have neglected you . I want you to know I am grateful for your loyalty and your willingness to serve , dear friend . " Naomi made a clucking sound with her tongue and said , " There 's no need for you to fear you have offended me . " She gave Martha a loving hug . " I know you see everything , for your eyes are everywhere ; so you are aware of the fruits of our labors . Your gratitude , my child , has always quietly shone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comment wrapped itself snugly around Martha 's inner coldness , and she savored its momentary warmth . She continued to sit and chat with Naomi and was just finishing the last of the porridge and picking at some tiny red pomegranate seeds when she heard Joseph calling her name and then saw him as he came looking for her . " What is it , Joseph ? " Martha got up and peered at him . " He is here ! I do n't mean here . I mean in the grove-garden down the hill . " Joseph 's face was wet with running , and his uneven breathing verified his run . " Slow down , " Martha cautioned . " Now , tell me who is here ? " " The Master , Jesus , and most of his disciples , " he panted . She snapped to alertness , her eyes alive and wide with apprehension . " What is he . . . ? " " It is true . He waits down there for you , Mistress Martha , " Joseph shouted . Hurriedly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whereabouts . He must have his reasons for staying in the grove . Perhaps his enemies have followed him . . . . "  | Martha did not finish her line of thought , nor did she have to tell them where she was going . Instantly she pulled her veil up and over her head . She disappeared out the back doorway , around the side of the house , and slipped through a small opening in the high outer wall which led to a narrow side street . Downhill she raced , wishing with every footfall she had Tabitha 's youth and gazellelike , graceful speed . Finally she reached the break in the grove 's stone wall and entered the grove-garden , ducking and pushing aside the low branches of the olive trees . Suddenly , as if out of nowhere , someone caught her arm . She stumbled but was immediately pulled up by a sure , firm grip . " Andrew ! " she gasped . " You frightened several years ' growth out of me . " What she had wanted to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart had quickened , not in fearful surprise , but with warm recognition at the sight of him . She was marvelously flooded with gladness at seeing her tall , red-haired friend . She wanted to tell him how right it was that he be in Bethany ; how she had missed his quiet , eloquent voice ; how she , had she dared , wished he had been with her during the past four days of sorrow . Instead she determinedly swallowed all her feelings , dismissing them as if they were much too unlikely , and regained her composure to ask , " Now , where is the Master ? " Andrew did not loosen his grip on her arm but began to guide her around flower beds and past leafy trees . As they scrambled through the grove , he said in a low voice , " Jesus ' enemies are resourceful , clever , and extremely dangerous . Every day groups of evil men who hate him increase their numbers . They multiply more rapidly than the holes in my fishing nets . It is wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it best to seek refuge here before we ventured up the street to your house . " " Of course , " Martha answered simply . Lazarus 's care had taken up so much of her time and thoughts that , here again , like forgetting to express her gratitude to Naomi , Martha had forgotten the frightening turn of events for Jesus . She shook her head as if to clear it .  | Andrew 's calm words and explanation revived her mind , and she wondered with sharpness if the death noose of Caiaphas , the high priest , and other religious men of importance would actually tighten around the throat of her friend Jesus . In remembering Jesus ' precarious situation , she also remembered her own keen disappointment in his seemingly thoughtless delay . Perhaps his personal safety was his reason for staying away , but Martha could n't put too much of it all together . Nor did she have a chance , because at that moment Andrew and she came upon Jesus and his men . They were talking in low voices as they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand Martha held a tree branch out of her way and with the other hand on her hip , she looked down at him . She had wanted to give him greetings and to be hospitable with the others , but four days of grieving and four days of questioning left a bitter-tasting film on her tongue , and she spit out the words before she could stop herself . " Oh , Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died ! " In the hour just before Lazarus 's death , Martha had been filled to overflowing with an abundance of faith . She was so sure of Jesus ' ability to heal , so trusting in his deep friendship , so sure that he would drop everything to rush to them , and proven so wrong with Lazarus 's death . Martha 's anguish was genuine as she looked down at Jesus , and her unspoken reproach filled her soul . Why , why did you not come in time to save him ? You could have snatched your friend from the jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : yet you did not come . Now you are too late , she said to herself as she looked down at him . She stood awaiting his reply , deeply enmeshed in her own frustrating pondering . Yet somehow she could feel herself being captivated once more by the intensity of Jesus ' soul-searching gaze upon her . He is so hard to resist , she thought and found a moment of peace . Martha looked down at him , and he seemed to be bathed in an aura of dignity even though he was seated beneath her at her feet . There it was again , an incredible majesty which covered him with a royal mantle . Somehow , even with her dark well of  | thoughts , Martha gleaned a vague measure of hope . It was this small seed of hope which prodded her to state , " I know that even now , whatever you ask of God , He will grant you . " She had faith in him , but it was a faith with some reservations . Mary had been right when up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' powers . But a change was taking place within her , and standing here , looking at what Andrew and the others called the " long-awaited Messiah , " Martha 's faith increased , and her thought process began a bending toward a new direction . Jesus smiled up at her as if he could see and measure the changing as it occurred within her , and he reached for her hand . Martha needed no prompting . She gave him both hands and knelt down on the grass beside him . Later she was to say of that time , " In that moment I began my surrender . " Andrew and the other disciples hushed their talk completely and gave Jesus and Martha their full attention . Still holding her hands , Jesus straightened his back and sat erect and still before her . His words were spoken in a low voice but rang with unmistakable , ultimate authority . " Your brother will rise again . " Martha smiled and thought , Spoken like my good father , a devout Pharisee . Part of her religious training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality of the soul , and the belief in life after death flashed before her mind . She was pleased Jesus would console her in her loss . Martha shrugged her shoulders and warmly responded , " Oh , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day . " " Martha ! " Jesus cried impassionately , and his eyes frightened her with their piercing magnitude . " I am the resurrection and the life . " The words I am thundered at her . Martha sat there , daring not to speak or move , for she had never heard him speak so fiercely . His words , penetrating her soul with their directness , continued . " I am the one who raises the dead and gives them life again . Anyone who believes in me ,  | even though he dies like everyone else , shall live again . No one who lives and believes in me will ever die . " Do you believe this , Martha ? " The tone of his voice vibrated through the grove , and Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Jesus meant physical death , spiritual death , or both , but without pausing to examine his deep utterance , her obedient , if not blind faith , supplied the answer . " Yes , Master . I believe you are the Messiah , the Son of God , the one we have so long awaited . " They fell silent , and a peaceful pause restored the tranquillity of the grove . A few moments later Jesus asked of Mary and expressed a desire to see her ; so Martha excused herself and left them to fetch her sister . She had gone only a few yards when Andrew fell into step beside her . They walked quickly , but Martha took advantage of their private moment . " Andrew , there is a small lump of hardness in my breast , because I still do not understand why Jesus did not come to see us when Aaron gave him our message . Did he express his reasons to you ? What happened up there in Perea ? " Andrew scratched his head , pursed his lips together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were just as puzzled by it all as you . In fact , we still are . " When Jesus heard the boys ' message , he continued to teach as if nothing had happened . We did not understand then , nor did we two days later when he abruptly announced at our morning meal that we would go to Judea . " Some of the men objected to our going . They reminded Jesus that only a few days earlier the Jewish leaders in Judea had tried to stone him to death . " I , myself , questioned why he would risk such a foolish venture and asked him directly if he really was going back there again . " Jesus ' only answer was confusing . He said that during the twelve hours of his daylight work , he could walk in safety , because the strength and powers of his duty , which was the will of his father , would keep him from harm .  | " Then he puzzled us even more , for he told us that Lazarus had gone to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed he meant a natural sleep , and one or two men rejoiced that Lazarus was getting better . But Jesus shook his head sadly and corrected us all by plainly telling us that Lazarus was dead , not sleeping . " But then Jesus said the strangest thing of all . " " What was that ? " Martha had stopped , and she took Andrew 's arm . " Jesus looked at all of us and said , For your sake , I am glad I was n't there , for this will give you another opportunity to believe in me . Come , let 's go to him . ' When Thomas heard these last words of Jesus , he threw up his hands in resignation . Thomas is a good man , Martha , and a loving man , but he is ever despondent and constantly looking on the darker side of things . However , we could not help but smile when he said , Of course , let 's go too ; so that we may die with him . ' " Then we broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation with a shrug of his shoulders . Martha gasped , " Then Jesus knew all along that my brother was dead ! " She had no further opportunity to explore the startling possibilities of her statement , for they had reached the narrow gate off the side street . Both slipped through the opening and walked under the back portico . " Andrew , wait here , " Martha whispered . " I shall slip around and enter the house from the front doors to avoid arousing suspicion . Mary and I will have to leave by the front gate . I hope we can do it quietly . We will meet you on the lower street in a few moments . " As she rounded the side of the house , she nearly collided with Aaron and Jude astride a magnificent light-colored horse . " Oh , Claudius is here ! " she said out loud , and the boys ' gleaming eyes confirmed it . That 's good , she thought . We need a warrior to protect Jesus . His disciples , strong men that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is about to be stoned to death . Claudius stood as tall as Peter , but he fairly bulged with welldeveloped muscles . Even when he was very young , he could  | throw a spear farther than any soldier in his legion , and he wielded his dagger into action faster than an eye blinks . His dark hair was cut in the short , blunt cut of soldiers , and not only his impressive physical attributes , but his dark handsome looks helped his fast rise in rank . Because of his well-filled body and height , he began as a young lad in a cavalry regiment , and his love of horses blossomed and developed . Quite by accident he fell into a staff position for a legate , and learned to write so creditably that he became a magistrate as well . Martha had no trouble at all understanding how he eventually became the youngest tribune in the Jerusalem area . His skills , looks , and good fortune provided everything he had dreamed of as a small boy . He envisioned himself as a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because Claudius and his men had been assigned to patrol and keep the peace in the temple area , Jesus was no stranger to him . It was there , in the outer area of the temple , that Claudius 's heart was first moved . He told Martha and Mary later , " As I looked and listened to this man called Jesus , I experienced the first pangs of jealousy . It was as if , with all my rank and power , I had nothing compared to this man . Where I had never wanted before , I now felt an everwidening void , and I found myself staring at the walls in my quarters at night , wondering if what I possessed was worth anything at all . " Martha had never heard him say outright that he was a follower or a believer of Christ , but certainly he was a friend . She was relieved to know he was here and hoped she would find him quickly . As inconspicuously as possible , Martha hurried through the courtyard and into the main entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary to come to the doorway . In the same moment she realized Mary was talking with Claudius ; so she motioned that he come too . Martha stepped outside into the courtyard gardens and waited impatiently for them to untangle themselves from the others . Finally , in what seemed to Martha an eternity of time , Mary and Claudius sauntered over to Martha . In guarded whispers she  | told them of Jesus ' presence and that he had asked for her . Mary would have fled instantly to the grove , but Martha restrained her and said , " There is a need for secrecy and silence , my sister . Our friend Jesus ' life is in jeopardy , and we must proceed with caution . " Then , turning to Claudius , she said urgently , " You are a soldier , familiar with the ways of battle and evil men . Please  --  for us  --  see to his safety . " Hastily Claudius told them he had heard the ugly death rumors in Jerusalem , and that Martha 's request was unnecessary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , " he said . " Weeks ago , as I listened to the preaching of Jesus , my inner emptiness became a reality . " Once I heard him say to ask , for it would be granted ; to seek , for you would find ; to knock , for it would be opened ; so , without telling anyone , I asked . I asked for the Kingdom of God to fill my being and take up the emptiness . I do not know how this was done , but it was accomplished . " As he talked , he walked between the two women , and the three slowly strolled to the outer gates , unaware of several Jewish leaders following . " I have committed my soldiering skills to Jesus ' welfare and safety , " he finished . Everyone assumed they would turn to their left , go up the hill , and spend some time at the tomb . Instead , the three turned right and walked down the hill in the opposite direction to meet up with Andrew . The mourners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the grove-garden , Mary broke from Martha , Andrew , and Claudius and ran almost blindly to find Jesus . When she reached him she flung herself at his feet , weeping , and a great love spilled out of her as she expressed her inner yearnings . " Oh , Lord , if you had been here , my brother would still be alive ! " Martha heard Mary repeat her own statement as she reached them and marveled that when Mary said her exact words , they sounded so different . There was no accusation in Mary 's tone , only a weeping sadness and loving regret . Jesus pulled Mary to her feet . She was sobbing uncontrollably ,  | and to console her , he put his arms around her . Past her head he saw Martha , Andrew , Claudius , and a host of Jewish leaders . Martha took in the sight of all that love and misery , the pitiable spectacle of bereavement , the utter futility of human consolation at such a moment , the mourning Jews standing near the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully the strong emotions which shook Jesus ' frame with a powerful shudder . His voice was choked with sadness and almost savagely he cried out , " Where is he buried ? " Mary was still weeping and clinging to his shoulder ; so Martha stepped over to him . " Come and see . " He lifted his head up and the sun , filtering down through the feathery gray green olive trees , glistened on his face and beard as they were washed with his tears . He then bent his head , said something to Mary , and after nodding at his disciples , Jesus , his friends , and the crowd of mourners began their walk to Lazarus 's tomb . Martha and Andrew led the way with Jesus a few steps behind followed by Mary . Claudius stayed close to the little group but remained in a position clear of the men to see trouble before it began . Martha was not so far ahead of the group to miss hearing Rabbi Ben Isaiah and the others talking of Jesus . They were agreeing among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lazarus . Rabbi Ben Isaiah commented , " See how much he loved him . His tears prove it . " Then the tenor of the conversation changed , and Martha could n't see who , but someone , in a voice close to sneering , asked : " This fellow healed a blind man . Why could n't he keep Lazarus from dying ? " Martha burned with conviction , because the man 's question echoed her very own thoughts of a few days ago . She hoped Jesus had not heard , but he had . In that moment he stopped , turned around , and with angry , fiery eyes bore into the man who spoke . No one could tolerate the thrust of Jesus ' stormy emotion or his anger at the ghastly work of death ; so momentarily they stopped , midprocession , and dropped their eyes to mutely stare  | at the dust about their feet . The moment passed , and they resumed their walk . By the time they passed the house and had almost reached the tomb , Martha noted with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inhabitants . Now , keeping his presence in Bethany a secret will be impossible , Martha thought . Why do n't they just leave us alone ? Instead the procession picked up more people at each turn of the road , and eventually they all reached the rocky hill and stood in front of the family 's tomb . Jesus turned to some men standing just behind her , and to Martha 's dreadful horror , she heard him ask the men to roll the stone aside . Nothing he could have done would have shocked her more . Oh , dear Adonai , she breathed , we buried him the same day he died because of our ovenlike climate . His soul has utterly departed from his moldering , decomposing body , and I am not ready to reveal the shocking spectacle or bear the embarrassment if that tomb is opened . He must not open that tomb . Frantically she rushed at Jesus crying , " My Lord , my Lord , wait . By now the smell will be terrible , for he has been dead four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down in agreement . Jesus looked at her with patient compassion and solemnly asked , " Martha , did I not tell you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? " She looked upon his face  --  the face of all truth  --  and unable to resist or deny him , she spun around , and to the men she curtly snapped the order , " Do as he said . Open the tomb . " Then , attracting no one 's attention but Mary 's , Martha deliberately raised her veil over her head and wound it securely over her nose and mouth . Mary followed suit as she had been silently directed . After they recruited several more to help , the men finally moved the stone aside , leaving the entire entrance unbarred . Jesus left Mary and Martha and walked just up to the edge of the entrance . Everyone else backed up and shrank away , but no one took their eyes off the figure in front of the dark and silent tomb . A great hush fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the earth 's wispy sounds of birds , insects , and winds were settled and stilled . Jesus stood facing the dark cavern and lifted up his eyes to the heavens above and immediately thanked God for hearing his prayer . Martha pondered later that it was almost as if he had previously prayed and given his request to God , and God had already answered . Then Jesus seemed to direct his prayer to Martha and all the others who stood by , because he prayed , " And I know that You always hear me , but on account of the people around here , I said this so that they may believe that You have sent me . " Martha and Mary stood together , arms locked behind each other 's back , their veils drawn tightly over their faces . They could only stare and wonder at him , their strange and remarkable friend , Jesus . They could not believe their ears when a moment later , in the briefest of utterances , Jesus cupped one hand to his mouth and simply called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in Martha 's shoulder , not willing to see or hear anything from this dreadful place , but Martha stared at the back of Jesus and geared herself for the sickening odor of decaying flesh . It never came . Jesus took a few steps to the side , and now the dark entrance was clearly visible . At first all they could see was just a black hole . Then a grayish figure rose slowly off the bench inside the entrance . Sluggishly the figure dragged itself upright and stiffly shuffled its way to the opening . Martha 's heart pounded and raced within . She shook Mary and fiercely whispered , " Look . . . look ! " Everyone moved together , as one silent mass , closer to the entrance , and as if they had one pair of eyes , they saw the white binding cloths which wrapped the tall figure of a man . They watched in utter disbelief as the figure tossed his head vehemently to shake off the head napkin , and instead of the repulsive odor they expected , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not watched the cave or the emerging figure but had turned to observe the faces and reactions of the people . When he  | saw they were stunned , motionless , unable to speak or move , he broke the silence , smiled , and , pointing at Lazarus , commanded , " Unbind him and let him go ! " Martha heard him first , and , leaving Mary , she sprang to aid the figure . She grabbed the head napkin and gasped with hazy recognition . " Lazarus , is it really you ? " The words clogged together in her throat . The color of his hair and his eyes was the same , but his skin had lost its pallor and was of a healthy hue . His eyes were dancing in brightness with the absence of pain . His smile was broad , and he teased , " Martha , will you stand there all day or will you help me out of this ? " Now she was laughing and crying all at once . She began unwinding the wide strips of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's our brother  --  Lazarus  --  come see ! " Mary and the others moved forward , not quickly at first , but cautiously . Finally the truth of it all began to come upon their hearts and minds like a magnificent sunrise , and everyone began talking at once . Their voices began in low murmuring tones and increased until it was the sound of a roaring lion . Some began to sing ; others wept or joyously laughed ; little children clapped their hands as if they had discovered a new game ; still others impulsively began to dance , but no one was still . Jesus stood off from the tomb , and as two little boys darted past him , he caught one and set the laughing boy up on his shoulders . Everyone 's glorious tumult shook the little hills of Bethany . Somehow Hannah pushed her way through to Martha 's side , and together they stripped the grave clothes off Lazarus 's body , leaving him standing in his wrinkled white tunic which was stained with the precious burial ointments . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth and gave a whooping shout of joy to the sky above . Then in delirious ecstasy , Lazarus grabbed Martha with one arm , caught Mary in the other , and whirled them about through the crowd of men , women , and children in an explosion of flying dust and skirts . All the while he was shouting , " I am alive ; you are alive ; we are alive ! Praise be to Jehovah , the giver of all life ! "  | When he finally put them down , Martha managed to catch her breath , and her questions tumbled out of her . " But how do you feel ? Is there any pain ? Are you alright ? How are you ? " " My sister , " he said in a loud voice , " I am hungry  --  that 's how I am  --  hungry . " Martha clasped her hands together , not really daring to believe what she heard ; so she repeated , " Hungry ? You are hungry ? " She had waited all his ailing years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing before her saying , " Yes , dear sister , go make me a feast ! " Then , with the corners of his mouth curving in a mischievous smile , he said in mocking confidentiality to Mary , " After all , our sister Martha has not fed me in how many days ? " Mary was still awestruck ; so she said nothing but held up four fingers . " Ah , yes , Martha has not served a scrap of food to me in four days ; so I should be hungry . " He ended by hugging and dancing both Mary and Martha through the crowd all over again . He was so newly awakened and so filled with pleasure at seeing Mary and Martha , he had not glimpsed Jesus or really seen any of the large group around him . Jesus still carried the little boy , but from one side of the tight circle of people which surrounded Lazarus , he called loudly , " You may feel hungry , and you look well enough , but I dare say you smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume for her wedding day ! " In the same moment all the humor and laughter of all the ages before and still to come settled down on Lazarus . He realized that his friend Jesus was responsible for bringing his soul and body back from death 's grave . That realization and Jesus ' happy words made Lazarus 's face beam with understanding , and out of his mouth came a burst of incredible laughter . It rang like a huge orchestra of trumpets , bells , and clanging cymbals , and its volume was almost deafening . Even as he laughed he ran , arms outstretched , the few steps into Jesus ' waiting embrace . Jesus put the small boy down , and the two men met , soundly clapped each other 's back , and shouted together . Then , flinging their heads back , they were  | absorbed in an exhilarating , yet holy , kind of contagious laughter and joy . Suddenly , seeing Lazarus and Jesus carrying on together like this , Martha , Mary , and each person in the crowd began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dead man was now alive , well , and even laughing . The magnitude of Jesus ' power was certainly evident when he made the blind man see , the lame child walk , and the lepers clean and free of their hideous disease , but this  --  this with Lazarus was different , they reasoned to themselves . Rabbi Ben Isaiah and a small group of men began to excitedly talk and question together as to how much power it would take to raise the dead back to life . Logically and systematically they ruled out prophet , mere teacher , and good , holy man , and came tentatively to the word messiah . " His power over life and death is not a trick . I know Lazarus was dead . Now he is not only alive , but never have I seen him so well , so full of good health . This Jesus must be who he says he is , the Messiah , the Son of God . " Rabbi Ben Isaiah was making the incredible statement . He was saying words he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of today 's extraordinary experience at the tomb , how could Jesus be anything but the Son of God ? He reasoned all this aloud to the old men of Bethany as they stood listening and stroking their beards as they pondered his words . Martha caught his words and found herself marveling at the old rabbi 's willingness to reverse his theological position . He has always said the claims of the carpenter would have to be proven and today , Martha thought , what better proof ? She was still caught up in the whirlpool created by Lazarus 's return and the crowd 's high emotions when her own thoughts repeated themselves to her . " What better proof ? " and with a profound new insight she said to herself , " I have admired and loved Jesus as a friend . I have served him , sometimes too diligently , but obediently , and I have believed in him . But after today 's proof I find I have not  | loved , served , and believed him completely and wholly without reservation . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him must not only be done because he is my friend , but because he is my Lord . " The truth  --  the whole truth of God ? began to illuminate each dark little corner of her mind . I must serve him not out of duty alone but cheerfully , willingly , and out of love . Her thoughts astounded her . The incredibility of knowing Jesus for the better part of three years and missing his lordship , his divine saviourhood , his true identity poured over her soul . How could I have been so blind ? " Dear Lord , " she cried silently to herself as her eyes found Jesus in the crowd . " You are not just my friend  --  you are my Saviour , my Redeemer , my Lord . You are God come down in flesh to me , to my brother , sister , friends  --  no , even to the whole world . How could I have been so close to you , yet almost missed you ? " You were here with me in my house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love rushing wildly about . " You were here within me , but I was not with you . You called me , but my ears were stopped , and I was deaf to your pleadings . " I did not sit at your feet with Mary , because I would not stop my serving long enough to listen to you . " But today , here at the tomb , you have broken past my deafness ; you have bathed me in your forgiveness ; you have wrapped me in your splendor ; you have taken the blindness from my eyes . " I do not know why I came to love you so late , my Lord . But I do love you , and I know who you are now , Jesus of Nazareth . You are my God , my King , my Saviour , my Messiah . " The wonder and depth of her words overwhelmed her . Martha uttered a small cry out loud , and with new understanding thought to herself , Oh , Lord , that is why you sent the message that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving glory to God . Here , today , in your prayer you said you were doing this so that the people gathered here would believe . Lord , did you know I would be one of those believers ? Did you know what today would be for me ? Martha looked at Jesus , and she knew he had heard all her thoughts , for he raised his head ,  | nodded silently to her , and his smile was filled with warm compassion and total understanding . " So you knew , " she said aloud , and from somewhere deep inside her , a small burning fire was smothered out ; a hard rocky place at her waist was instantly dissolved ; the band of tightness around her chest was snapped forever . Martha stood free ? hardly daring to believe the freedom . She might have stood there forever except that she was jolted back to life 's realities by Lazarus , who leaned close to her face and with eyes twinkling in merriment said , " As I said before , dear sister , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , of course , " she almost shouted . Martha grabbed Andrew 's arm and said , " If I am to feed him and this group , I shall have to do it quickly . Come with me to the fish market . Perhaps they have not closed their shop , and I pray they have some fish on hand . You can help me , old fisherman , to select the freshest fish ! " Andrew said nothing , but immediately left the others and took long strides to catch up with Martha as she rushed briskly down the hill ahead of all the others . The last remark she heard was made by Rabbi Ben Isaiah . The rabbi kept looking and pointing at Jesus , saying , " He is the One ! He is the One ! " Martha turned to Andrew and said , " For once our rabbi has said a truth without using a cartload of words . " They both laughed . " Andrew , " she said as they neared the bottom of the hill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something happening inside of me . It 's a queer , strange thing , and I scarcely can explain it . But up there on the hill , at the tomb , I . . . . " " Yes ? " Andrew gently prodded . " Well , " she was hesitating ever so slightly . " It 's just that I find it hard to believe that I have known Jesus for almost three years ; yet today , Andrew , today I really saw him . And what 's even stranger is that I feel so different , so . . . " she fumbled for the word , " ah , changed . I do n't seem to be myself . I like this newness , but suddenly it is all a little bewildering . Furthermore , a song seems to be beginning inside of me. "  | " Well , sing it to me then ! " laughed Andrew . " Me ? Oh , no , I 've always left the singing to Mary . You see , this is not like me . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you ever tried ? " " Of course not ! " she answered instantly . " I told you I 'm not the singer in the family . " " Oh , Martha , I do n't care , and the song does n't care , so sing it . " She hesitated , so Andrew went on . " Remember the night I first came to your house to tell you about Jesus ? " She nodded her head . " Then you should also remember how you kept telling me how different I was and how well I spoke , putting words together when all you could remember of me before was my eternal silence ! What you had forgotten was that I had met , seen , and given my life to Jesus , the Christ , the Redeemer , Saviour of the world , and , having done so , I was changed . Remember I still looked like Andrew , the fisherman , but the very marrow of my bones began a transformation , and the hidden but raw places inside of me began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eradicate the old Andrew in me . Instead , he began to pull out those qualities , character traits , and abilities that I never dreamed were within me . It has been a growing process which , to this day , has not stopped . " I suspect you , dear Martha , have always been able to sing , but you had no song . However , because of him you not only will sing , but your ears , deaf until now , will hear , all around you , the different miraculous music of God ! " She clasped his hand in hers in understanding , and they swung their arms skyward . They looked like two happy children , and whether it was appropriate behavior for a woman in her station in life or not , she called out to a man who peered down at them from a rooftop , " Rabbi Ben Isaiah says Jesus is the One . Lazarus , my brother , back from the grave , says Jesus is the One , and Andrew and I say it too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his afternoon nap , scratched his head and tried to make some sense out of Martha 's words . However , when he heard her singing he was genuinely surprised ! Her voice , filled with a deep , husky richness , was loudly bringing  | forth the haunting minor strains of a song . Not only had he never heard Martha sing , he had never heard the song itself , nor did he really understand a word of it ! By the time Martha and Andrew reached the fish shop , the few villagers who were not up at the sepulcher heard her song which spilled out of her like a waterfall of crystal clear mountain water ! It was an extraordinary song , sung by Bethany 's most unlikely singer , but it was borne out of an extraordinary event ; so she sang : He is the One ! Jesus , the anointed One . He is the One ! God 's beloved Son . Yes , he is the One ! He is the One ! He is Messiah come . Messiah come ! As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dried , salted fish that was left into a large basket , the merchants from the other small market stalls gathered together . All they could say , as they shook their heads in amazement , was , " Is this the voice of our Martha of Bethany ? " But of course that was before they heard the unbelievable news of Lazarus.  | THERE were many astounded witnesses to Lazarus 's preposterous , death-defying walk out of the dark tomb , and indeed many , like Martha , seeing with their own eyes , believed on the man and the miracle they saw . But others did not . A few days after what seemed to Martha a time of constantly cooking everything in sight for the ravenously hungry Lazarus , a small dark and forbidding cloud floated onto their horizon and overshadowed their newly found joy . Claudius was the first to speak openly about it with them . Martha had always assumed his arrivals in Bethany routinely coincided with Jesus ' visits , but later , when he came unannounced and by himself , Martha suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which drew or held his interest . The village gossipers had already begun to comment on the tribune 's slightly moonstruck look whenever Mary was about . But this day Claudius was grim , and his stern countenance matched the authority of his short red uniform , his brass helmet , and the gleaming sword which hung at his side . His large frame was looming above Mary and Lazarus in the courtyard when Martha saw him . As she reached them , Claudius was saying , " Yes , on the day of your resurrection , Lazarus , many did believe , but , my friends , there were others who carried their angry , alarmed reports directly to the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem . " He spit out his words contemptuously . " Those hypocritical men in that council  --  they meet in a spirit of hate and perplexity . They can not deny that a miracle has transpired which has restored your life , Lazarus , but they will  | not believe on him who performed it . " Right now they can only surmise with considerable dread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jesus will use this raising of Lazarus to proclaim himself a king . Then , of course , every one of those old foxes realizes that if Jesus does take his throne as king , the Roman government will have to intervene . If that happens , their political existence could be annihilated . Even now it 's severely threatened . " One of my Roman friends reported that the Sanhedrin vainly raged in impotent discussions until Joseph Caiaphas addressed them . How vile that man is ! " Claudius smote his fists together as if he wished Caiaphas had been a small fly smashed upon impact . " But he is our high priest ! " Lazarus put forth , implying the goodness and holiness of the office . " It means nothing , " Claudius retorted agitatedly . " Ever since Valerius Gratus made him high priest nine or ten years ago , replacing Annas , you Jews have hoped the sincerity of heart , the gift of prophecy , and the holy honor would still linger upon the priesthood . But I tell you , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has privately said , The glory of the Lord has departed from this one ! ' " My friend Phileros , whose presence was not detected , saw and heard with his own eyes and ears the diabolical plot of that old snake , Caiaphas , when he spoke a few days ago . " He said Caiaphas arrogantly stood before the Sanhedrin and with a shameless avowal of his most selfish and unjust policies , haughtily told everyone that all their proposals about Jesus ' fate were words of mere ignorance . Fools ' he called them . Then loudly he hissed that the only thing to do about this man was to sacrifice the victim ! " " But , " Mary searched Claudius 's face for answers , " did no one speak in defense of Jesus ? Was there not one who stood up for him or told of the wonders he performs ? " she asked . " Yes , two men tried , " Claudius said , " but old Elias added wood to Caiaphas 's fire by saying he 'd heard it rumored that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself King of Israel . " Murmurs of agreement rose from everyone there , for they  | already knew that large masses of people follow Jesus even now . " Finally , before it was settled , two men  --  Joseph of Arimathea and Rabbi Nicodemus  --  tried to change Caiaphas 's mind , but it was all in vain . " Even Joseph 's argument that Jesus had publicly stated that his kingdom was not of this world went unheeded . " Nicodemus went on record to say he had heard the Nazarene preach , and he had seen with his own eyes , sick men , women , and children healed once they were touched by him . My friend Phileros said there was a shocked and appalling silence that followed when Nicodemus ended his plea by suggesting they all consider that Jesus might be who he said he was  --  the Messiah . Someone shouted , Never ! ' and then many cried that Jesus was a blasphemer . At that point , Phileros said , the chamber was filled with one heated argument after another . Blasphemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became angry screams . " Caiaphas raised his hands to stop the cacophony and gradually they settled down in an uneasy silence to listen . " Caiaphas dismissed all dissenting arguments . He did not even pause to investigate or define the victim 's innocence or guilt , nor did those who sat before him . They simply accepted , unhesitatingly , Caiaphas 's voice of authority , and with only Joseph and Nicodemus as exceptions , the Sanhedrin council agreed to a secret order which decreed that Jesus must be put to death . " However , " Claudius wearily continued , " within hours , Phileros told me their badly kept secret of a human sacrifice was out . Now Jesus lives with a price on his head . " Claudius walked away leaving them with their facts clouded in fearful disbelief , and he sank down heavily on a marble bench beside a flowering oleander bush . The three of them just stared at Claudius as he held his head in his hands . Lazarus was the first to break the morning 's stillness . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil threat . " A low groan escaped from Claudius 's chest , and he murmured ,  | " It is no idle threat , and they will carry it out , my friend . They will . " " No , it can not be , " Lazarus asserted . " According to the law now , we , the people of Israel , may put a lamb or a goat to death , but not a man . Caiaphas can not bring about Jesus ' death . " " Then I must remind you , " Claudius said slowly , " that while Israelites are not allowed to carry out the death penalty in this occupied country , we Romans know no such limitations . " Caiaphas and the whole Sanhedrin can pronounce Jesus guilty and condemn him to death . Then all they have to do is present the charges to Pilate , and the Roman government will carry out the sentence at their own discretion . They can even decide what degree of punishment  --  from a light scourging with the whip to . . . crucifixion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we know from Lazarus 's glorious return , beyond a shadow of any doubt , that Jesus holds the power of life and death in his own hands . I say he will not allow Caiaphas , his men , or soldiers to take him . " Martha spoke the words and was firm and practical in her thinking . Up to this point in the conversation , Mary had stood by listening with her lovely blue eyes clouded with questions and fearful thoughts . Then quietly but clearly , she jarred their memories . " What we seem to be forgetting is that Jesus himself has continually alluded to his death . Has he not stated privately to several that he is to die , that he will not always be with us ? I wonder if he already knows Caiaphas 's plan and has accepted it as a part of his destiny for some reason . " Mary 's insight was beyond sorting out ; so for a moment they were simply quiet , each of them wrapped in his own thoughts . The turtledoves continually cooed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals . Claudius returned them to reality by saying , " I do n't know if Jesus has known before of their plans , but I am sure he knows now as he has already departed from Jerusalem . " There was a sharp intake of air from the three of them , and with their eyes they questioned him for more details . Claudius was holding his helmet , and he fidgeted with the plume of bristles on it as he spoke . " I saw Andrew before the  | sun rose today . He was gathering provisions for their journey . He said to tell you in secret that their destination is the obscure little village of Ephraim on the edge of the desert . He also cautioned me to tell no one else of their whereabouts . " Then , directly to Martha , Claudius said , " Andrew sends you his salutations , and he gave me this message . He said , Tell Martha to keep singing . ' I do n't know quite what he meant by that . " Mary stopped a small giggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't know you sang , Martha , " Lazarus said grinning . " I really do n't , " she muttered and turned her head so he would n't see that her eyes had brightened at Andrew 's message . Mary hugged her sister , and winking over Martha 's shoulder , she said to Lazarus and Claudius , " She does n't sing for just anybody ! Only Andrew . " Their merriment was short-lived , because Claudius said , " I suspect if the disciples and the Master ever needed a song it is now . " A disturbing silence fell about them . " I hated to see them leave , " Claudius continued , " but my army discipline and training in the art of soldiering confirms that their move is a wise one . I do not see how anyone could protect Jesus from death if he continued his public ministry so openly among the vast throngs of people . " The doves finally silenced their cooing as the heat of spring began to settle down around them in the courtyard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them retreated to the cool interior of the great stone house . For the rest of the day and even after Claudius had gone back to his headquarters in Jerusalem , the brother and his two sisters huddled together praying and reasoning over the strange turn of events concerning their friend and Lord . Martha noted with some relief that life went on for the next few weeks with a return to some normalcy  --  if indeed it could ever go back to the old way , what with Lazarus filled to the brim and overflowing with all the good health he never had . A brief smile flickered across her face as she thought about his newly  | awakened life . In fact , Lazarus began putting on weight which was partly due to his enormous appetite and partly because of Naomi and Martha 's gleeful devotion to making up for all the years he idly picked at their cooking . While thoughts of Jesus never left their minds , they could n't help but be caught up and consumed by the euphoric joy of seeing this beloved one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not only alive but bursting with a healthy countenance and frame ! Spring was fully upon them all . To Lazarus , it was his first season of good health , and he took full advantage of his strength . Together with Joseph , he tramped over the countryside inspecting fields and searching for newborn lambs that might need assistance . His days were long , rich , and full of captured dreams . To Mary , ordinary days glittered with wonderment , but spring days were shouting festivals of joy ! Now with Lazarus alive and well it also meant a time of rapturous praising to God and a time of discovering all the flowers which were bursting with fragrant blooms . She listened to baby birds valiantly trying out their new voices , and several times she roamed the back hills , carrying her sandals in her hand , so she could feel the newness of spring as she walked barefoot in the velvetlike emerald green grass . Spring , to Martha , was all of those things too , but only in a small way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? cleaning ! Clearly she reveled in it and thoroughly looked forward to it . By the time the Passover feast would arrive , her house would be ceremoniously , religiously , and immaculately clean . It would also " sparkle and shine enough to blind a person " as Lazarus had often said . It was true , but Martha felt a new exuberance about the whole thing . Washing , cleaning , and polishing were things a person could do and really get his teeth into . It was practical , and it was needed ; so spring cleaning was rewarding to her sense of doing . She loved it . Together with the servant girls , Martha worked tirelessly , and no nook or cranny was left untouched . Over the years , Deborah , Leah , and Tabitha had collected lovely treasures for their labors . Always after Passover , Martha  | put action to her appreciation , and the gifts she bought the girls made the long hours of their work seem like only fleeting moments . This spring Martha gave herself to cleaning with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small carpet , and Martha was flailing away at it with a sturdy stick that Tabitha ventured , " You are really enjoying this cleaning , are n't you , Mistress ? " The dust Martha was beating out of the rug was getting into their clothes , hair , eyes , and mouths . Martha stopped , looked over at Tabitha and then down at her own dress , and laughing , said , " I 'm taking this too seriously again , I see . " The two women walked back into the house with several small carpets in their arms , and Martha confided , " Tabitha , its just that I have this feeling . " " What feeling , Mistress ? " " Well , I think this year during Passover , Jesus and his men will have the Paschal Supper here with us in Bethany . I believe he will come here to celebrate . He has not said he would , and I do n't know why I feel this so strongly , but I do . " " Ah , " sighed Tabitha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falling on our pallets at night like dead flies . " In the days that followed , Martha gave herself to cleaning , but as the house began to shine from her efforts , she began to spend more time checking the front entrance and outer courtyard . She was so sure they would come , she did n't want to miss the first glimpse of Jesus or his men . Many of her thoughts during the day were of Jesus , but at night , when all was quiet , she was haunted by other thoughts . Always she wondered about Lazarus 's four days in the tomb . What was it like ? Was he alone and cold ? Was he afraid ? On and on the questions paraded before her . She decided it was unseemly of her to ask ; yet never had anyone known a person to return from the grave . So she reasoned , Why not ? It 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity  --  but what if my questions embarrass him , and he refuses to answer ? Finally , when she could stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last bite of lamb stew had been finished , and the delicate  | spice and honey cakes had melted away in their mouths , Martha boldly began her questions . It was what all the rest of them wanted to know but were too timid to ask . Their friends , the widow Hannah and the neighbor Simon , were guests that evening , and since they were old friends , Martha decided to go ahead and speak her mind . " My brother , " she began , " I do not want to offend you or cause you any distress , but we have never known or spoken to anyone who has come back from the place of waiting . Our curiosity blows through us like a strong wind . Tell us what it is like to die . " When no one spoke she added , " So when our time comes we may meet death with a knowledgeable dignity . " Her statement , perfectly phrased , suddenly set off an avalanche of inquiries from the others , and their questions about his dying tumbled out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ? " " Was it dark and cold ? " queried Simon . " Were you frightened and alone ? " This from the widowed heart of Hannah . " Did you see God ? " " Wait , " Lazarus cried and in good humor held his hands over his ears . When they settled into stillness , he apologized . " Forgive me , I should have known you would wonder , and I should have told you about it before this . " " Begin at the beginning , " said Mary , her hands clasped under her chin , elbows perched on the table , and her eyes wide with anticipation . " The beginning ? Ah , yes . You were singing that silly but wonderful song about Jesus coming to our house . I was listening when I slowly realized I was not in any pain whatsoever . It was a new experience for me , and it was a very peaceful thing to simply lie there listening to your voice . " Then your song faded away ; so I looked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a most wondrous sight ! " Mother and Father were standing at the end of my pallet ! Their faces were wreathed in loving smiles , and they beckoned me to get up and go with them . " " You really did see them ? You were with them ? " Mary 's  | eyes were spilling over with tears , and the others listened with enraptured ears . He nodded yes . " You were not afraid  --  even though you knew they were both dead all these many years ? " Martha questioned . " Oh , no , there was not the slightest fear , only a growing feeling of anticipation which seemed to fill my soul . It was rather like the times I remembered from when we were small and would be getting ready to travel northward to the beautiful seashore of Capernaum . I felt that same excited desire to get started . " It was a strange moment , for while I lay there on my pallet , my spirit seemed to leave me , and it rose to meet them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a butterfly coming out of its cocoon . No pain , no fear just an incredibly peaceful transition , and in front of me were the open , waiting arms of our beloved parents . " " Where did they take you ? " Simon 's choked voice whispered . " To a distant mountain , and while I 'm not sure how they took me , suddenly we were standing before gigantic iron gates which stood like sentinels before the mouth of a tunnel in the side of a large , barren mountain . " Slowly the gates opened , and as we walked down the tunnel to an enormous underground cave , we were welcomed by many , many people . I could n't begin to see everybody , there were so many , but the place felt warm and secure . And the people  --  oh , the people  --  they were beautiful . They were saints of God . " " Sheol is believed to have two subterranean parts : one place called Paradise or Abraham 's bosom , for the righteous ; and the other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his religious training had been correct . Then he asked , " Did you see the other place ? " " No , but I had no doubt that where I was had to be Abraham 's bosom , for the peace of God rested on each person like a warm woven cloak , " Lazarus said , shaking his head . " How did you pass the time of day ? " Mary asked . " That 's just it , my sister . There was no passing of time  --  no  | sunrises or sunsets , no need to eat or sleep . Our souls just talked and fellowshiped with one another . That is why at the tomb , I had to ask you how long I had been gone . I had no way of knowing . " " You were n't cold or lonely , then ? " Hannah looked intently at Lazarus as she asked the question out of the depths of her grieving heart . " No , not at all . It was , as I said , a warm , friendly place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere or in anybody . " Martha leaned forward , " You sound almost as if you would have liked to remain there . " He flashed an affectionate smile at her before answering , " You may be right about that , my sister , for during my stay in Sheol , besides the wonderful people I was with and the joy of being reunited with our parents , I experienced the first moments of wholeness in my body . To be without pain or weakness after so many years  --  well , it is hard to describe . " He stopped as he suddenly remembered what he wanted to tell Martha . He startled her by grabbing her arm . " I meant to tell you this sooner , Martha . I saw Benjamin . " She winced with the sharp pain that pinched her heart . " Do you remember how badly Benjamin and our father were torn apart by the chariot and horse 's hooves ? " " Oh , that I could forget that hideous sight , Lazarus . Even yet I see them in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease the pain . A surge of sour nausea filled her mouth . " Well , my Martha , " Lazarus 's face was radiant , " I saw Benjamin and Father , and they have not one mark , wound , scar , or blemish on them . They are whole  --  as whole as I am now ! " Martha 's hand flew to her mouth as she gasped , " They are whole ? " " Perfectly whole . " The words " He restoreth my soul " swept over her , and she thought , How wonderful . God even restores broken bodies . Martha regained her composure and began slowly breathing again . She sat lost in her thoughts as she contemplated how good it would be to see , for once and for all , the unblemished forms of  | Ben and her father . It would be like looking at Lazarus now , she thought . She turned toward him , and her vision blurred with happy tears . Mary 's chin was resting in her hands , and she did not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone so well and having once experienced the wonder of Sheol , was it wrong for us to wish you back here with us ? " Her keen discernment took him by surprise , but he eased her worry with a short laugh and said , " I certainly might have thought so for a moment or two while I was vainly trying to get unwound from those grave clothes , but one look at your surprised and joyous faces eased any doubts about returning . " There is something else , " he said and grew sober with his inner thoughts . " I 've just had time to reflect on and realize this , but I now know I will never again be afraid of death and dying . It has lost its terror , for I have seen how it really is . " You must not fear death either , " he said , looking deeply into each face . " The righteous , the just , the believers need not fear the transition time or the breaking of earthly ties . There 's so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not fear the moment . " He leaned back away from the table , and looking absently at the ceiling beams , he finished by saying , " At this time I 'm not sure how I shall serve the Lord or in what manner I shall spend the rest of my days but . . . . " Then looking into their faces he said , " Dear ones , he brought me back for a reason , and I intend not to fail him . " For a long time they sat there trying to absorb all his words . Each person was filled with the awesome hope of resurrection . Somehow their burdens of grief were lighter than they had ever been , and old wounds were quietly healed .  | LAZARUS was something of a celebrity , and the curious crowds filled the narrow streets of Bethany to capacity . They waited half the day to catch a fleeting glance of Lazarus . The people talked of him as a man who had cheated death , and some even believed that if they could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too would cheat and rob death of its victory . His fame grew , and exaggerated stories of Lazarus 's experience abounded . At first Martha was filled with an exhilarated sense of Wellbeing over all the interest . She desired that all who came to see Lazarus would become believers , as she had . But as the days wore on , the crowds increased , and her evangelistic zeal cooled . When camel caravans were routed up the hill to her house , Martha 's enthusiasm waned and then ebbed completely away . Bethany was no longer a quiet , restful village , and what had been called a house of retreat , now became the town 's center place for congregating  --  like the main well in some villages . Mary found Martha outside their front gate one morning , busily attacking the large mounds of camel dung with her broom . Martha 's face was stormy with a scowling frown . " Martha , my sister , " she called , ignoring all the travelers ' and visitors ' inquisitive stares , " do n't be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wonder . Naturally they have come hoping to see Lazarus with their own eyes . " Martha kept flinging her broom at a stubborn pile and shouted back , " I am pleased with their reasons for being here , dear sister . It is what they leave behind that angers me ! "  | Mary 's bubbling laughter filled the courtyard and floated past the startled eyes of strangers . As the spring season slipped luxuriously into its fullblossomed and ripened maturity , Martha , Mary , and Lazarus tried to ignore the crowds , and they rested well in the fact that Jesus ' hideaway was still a secret . It was known only to a small faithful band of followers , and they reassured themselves that no harm had befallen him . The council of the Sanhedrin , however , knew no such peace , and they were totally frustrated in their attempts to locate Jesus discreetly . Slowly the plotting men realized his hiding place would not be purposely or accidentally revealed to them ; so they published an order . It decreed that if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forth and reveal Jesus ' location . The Pharisees were bold enough to publicly add , " So that we may seize and arrest this Jesus . " It was reported that even their bribes had not yielded up Jesus ' whereabouts , and rumors raged that Caiaphas and the council were seething in anger . As the time of the Passover drew near , more people than just his close followers wondered if Jesus would leave his secret burrow to come to Jerusalem . Would he come , as countless other pilgrims , to ceremoniously purify himself from defilement before the great feast of the Passover ? Would he , in fact , join the streams of caravans filled with Galilean Jews , knowing it would surely cause his death ? Would he risk exposure and arrest for Passover ? Martha , Mary , and Lazarus pondered these and other questions on the rooftop in the cool of Bethany 's evenings . Martha insisted Jesus would spend Passover with them even if he did it secretly . But each night 's conversation left them pooling their own ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers or solutions . The only thing they were sure of was that Jesus would be relatively safe during the day with great crowds of people surrounding him . The Pharisees would not risk the multitude 's anger , especially when it was close to Passover time . But at night , that was the problem . Claudius had told Lazarus that if ever they arrested Jesus at  | night , away from the throngs of followers , it would mean his certain death . They wondered among themselves , and their apprehension grew with each day . One morning , just seven days before Passover , their confusing speculations came to an abrupt halt with a loud , banging noise on their front gates . " He has returned ! I knew he would ! " Martha bounded off her pallet . She pulled over her head the first tunic her hand found and ran for the front door . Early rays of rosy sunlight were peeking through the trees in the courtyard as she opened the outer gates . Disappointed but cordial , she greeted their neighbor Simon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings you here so early ? " Martha asked . He brusquely hurried in , caught her arm , and whispered fiercely , " May we go inside ? I have news of the Master . " Once inside , Simon 's words burst out of him like a long pentup stream of water . " First , Martha , Jesus was seen yesterday with a pilgrim caravan in the barren gorge which leads up to Jerusalem from Jericho . " Simon turned his head away from Martha as he talked . It was an old habit he found almost impossible to break . Only two years ago Jesus had stretched out his hand and touched Simon . It was a simple act , but because Simon was who he was , the act carried with it a sentence of exile . Simon 's body bore all the mutilating marks of the scathing , loathsome disease called leprosy . His fingers had been slowly eaten away , and his hands had become nothing more than stiff , useless claws . His feet were scarred with ulcers , and they were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet buckling under him . His nose , once large and regal , had collapsed and disappeared beneath the surface of his skin . The absence of his eyebrows and his heavily wrinkled skin joined together to confirm the ugliness and stigma of his disease . Yet with one unhesitant , unconditional hand , Jesus touched him , and Simon , once unclean , rejected , and even superstitiously  | feared , was made instantly whole . In that moment , Simon had gingerly examined his fingers , feet , face , and found to his amazement that everything had been restored to its original completeness in one touch , as if they dared not hesitate for a second to do Jesus ' bidding ! When he had been pronounced clean again , Simon had resumed living with his family in Bethany , and since his kinsfolk were Jerusalem merchants who worked on the same street as Martha 's father and uncle , the bond of friendship was strong between the two families . Still , he turned his head when he spoke , implying that he was even yet unclean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned it to her . " You always forget you do not have to worry over such things any more . Now speak directly to me , as I do not want to miss anything . You said you have news of Jesus ? " His smile was apologetic yet warm , and thus reassured by Martha 's acceptance , he spoke directly to her , ignoring his years of lepers ' customs . " Yes , early this morning I found Jesus ' caravan , and he told me he will part from his train of pilgrims . I think some of the pilgrims will enjoy the hospitality of friends in the city , and others will set up booths or tents in the valley of Kedron or the western slopes of the Mount of Olives . But Jesus said he will come here  --  here to Bethany . " " I knew it ! " Martha gasped , daring not to believe all of this , but desperately wishing it were so . " When ? " " Tomorrow night , just before sunset commences the Sabbath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must tell the others , and I must make a great feast . She was about to begin cooking and cleaning the already spotless house when Simon caught her arm . " Is there something else ? " Martha questioned , fearing for a moment that all the news was not good . " Only that . . . " he hesitated , for he had eaten at her house , knew her reputation as a hostess , and was not too sure her reaction would be pleasant . " While you are to supervise the  | entire feast , for your abilities are well loved by the Master and all of us .... " " Yes ? " she leaned forward , interrupting him . " I asked Jesus if the dinner could be given at my house up the street . I have never shown my gratitude for all he has done for me , and I wanted . . . . " " Oh , " Martha laughed in a breathless burst of relief . " Is that all ? Of course , dear Simon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house , and I shall see to the food ; so the feast will be the finest in all of Bethany ! " Then with more insight than he knew he possessed , he tilted his head to one side , and looking at her thoughtfully , he said , " Martha , you are skilled in cooking , serving , and seeing to others ' needs , but somewhere along the way you have acquired the gracious grace of genuine hospitality , and I salute you , my neighbor . " She was unaccustomed to compliments concerning her behavior , especially as to having " gracious grace , " but seeing that he was serious , she meekly replied , " I thank you for noticing . " As quickly as possible , Martha escorted Simon out the door and through the courtyard to the gates , so she could rush back to tell everyone the news . The day passed in a rush of furious activity , involving trips to the market and continuous trips from her cooking area to Simon 's house and back again . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd be ready for flower arrangements the following day . Lazarus and Joseph were dispatched to take all the wooden stools up the hill to Simon 's house , for an overflow of guests was expected , and everyone was pressed into a flurry of flying feet and busy hands . Their exhilaration approached the point of silly childish giddiness , but such was their joy , and they abandoned themselves to the enormous task of the banquet . By late afternoon , the day of the banquet , Martha had whipped everything into perfect order . The cucumbers , leeks , and onions were all washed and scrupulously free from blemish or dirt . Both plump ducks , picked clean inside and out , and a large selection of quail were  | securely fastened to the roasting spit , and already their juices were dripping and hissing onto the bright coals below , making a delicious aroma . Joseph brought in two wineskins from their underground cellar cave , and Martha pointed both him and the skins in the direction of Simon 's house . Mary cut and artistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readied pottery jars and bronze vases to make Simon 's house a house of color and fragrance . After the richly brown crusted fowls were taken up to Simon 's , the final touch was added by Martha . She took her assortment of small bowls to add to Simon 's table , and when that was accomplished , the banquet was ready . Martha had worked as hard as she ever did in planning and executing such a feast , but Jesus ' words about her serving and , somehow , her experience at the tomb had taught her some special lessons . Remembering the dire consequences of fatigue , she saved time to rest and refresh herself . There was even a sweet time with Mary , involving whether Martha should wear the blue dress with the darker blue bib and girdle or the flaxen-colored one with its brightly embroidered green accessories . They laughingly chose the flaxen one for Martha , because the green girdle reminded Mary of the bright yellow green of spring and of Lazarus 's fresh new life ! The two sisters laughed together as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seek once more . Finally , when they were all dressed , the two sisters and brother made their hurried way up the hill four houses to Simon 's , but it was not the usual quick easy walk . Somehow , between word of Jesus ' suspected arrival and the unbridled curiosity concerning Lazarus , many people thronged the streets . Passage through them was almost impossible . Then someone recognized Lazarus , Martha , and Mary , and the three thought they 'd be trampled to death . By some high-stepping maneuvering , they managed to get to Simon 's house and were relieved when the gates opened magically , and Simon 's arm reached out and pulled them quickly into his garden .  | The house had no separate place for dining , but it was spacious , and the table was set up in the large common room . Martha 's quick glance before she and Mary reached the cooking area confirmed that all was ready , and her face glowed with satisfaction . They were both arranging some dried fruits on large trays when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived . The women hastily took off the towels around their waists and went to greet the guests . Martha was impressed and humbled by the assembly of men before her . Jesus and all of the twelve disciples were there as well as a few faithful believers . Among others , there were distinguished men like the Rabbi Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea . Martha nodded her shalom to Andrew above the heads of Matthew and James , but in all the hubbub she knew she would have to wait to actually speak to him . Simon and some of his servants were all given to the washing of feet and hands , and greetings were warmly being exchanged when Mary and Martha slipped up behind Jesus and touched his arm to make their presence known . Martha would remember later that night , after everyone was settled on their pallets or in their sleeping quilts , how startled Mary 's face had been when Jesus turned around to greet them . Mary 's lovely skin had turned ashen in color , but there was no time to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha simply greeted Jesus and then , excusing herself to the cooking area , left them together . There was no decision to be made as to who the governor of this feast would be , for Simon himself put the specially made robe upon Jesus and led him to the bench of honor . However , surprising Lazarus completely , Simon motioned that Lazarus should sit right beside Jesus as the next honored guest . It was a splendid beginning , and Simon 's broad , beaming grin grew even wider as the first of many courses began to be served . Martha was absorbed in her delegating duties and pleased beyond reason that everything was going exactly as it should . This was a new feeling for her . She was actually loving every
