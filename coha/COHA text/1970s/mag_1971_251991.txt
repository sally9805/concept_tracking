Taiwan 's first reaction to the President 's decision to go to Peking was sharp and angry . The event , said Foreign Minister Chou Shu-kai , was " deplorable . " Taiwan 's Ambassador to the U.S. blasted Nixon 's move . Outwardly , Chiang Kai-shek kept his dignified cool by spending some time at the Evergreen Hotel on Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan , his favorite summer resort . But both Chiang and his son and heir , Chiang Ching-kuo , 61 , who is stubborn and tough like his father , had no illusions about the erosion of the position on which they have built their lives . As Taipei 's Ambassador to the U.N . complained candidly : " The U.S. has pulled the rug out from under our feet in the U.N . The damage to us is immeasurable . " The proposed Nixon trip , he said , shows that " Communist intransigence pays off " and " hands a prestige victory to the Communists on a silver platter . " <P> In contrast , the mood of the Chinese public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment was relatively mild . The only protest gathering of any size was a polite half-hour demonstration at the American embassy by 30 college students . Many people , especially workers and farmers , either have not heard the news or show scant interest in it . While those who have heard it strongly oppose the Nixon move , and appear worried about future American intentions , there is little evidence yet of fever-pitch anger or anti-American feeling . <P> Surely Quit First . One reason may be that Nixon 's news did not fall in a vacuum . The sensitive Nationalists have hung on each step that the President has made easing trade and travel with Peking . But his giant stride has called into question Taiwan 's U.N . status , and touched off intensive political and diplomatic strategy sessions on the island . <P> The essence of the tacit new U.S. position is " dual representation , " in which China would take the Security Council seat that Taiwan now holds as well as the Chinese seat in the General Assembly ; Taiwan would also be seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China proper presumably would be left for future decision , but obviously the Nationalist regime 's claim to be the government of China would no longer be recognized . But while Taiwan has indicated that it would remain in the U.N . if China were admitted to the General Assembly , the nub of the question is whether Taipei will be able to retain its permanent seat on the Security Council . Only the Taiwan government 's delay in advising the U.S. precisely what it will do is keeping the U.S. from announcing its own decision on Taiwan 's dilemma . <P> The real problem may be keeping Taiwan from being expelled entirely . Says the Indian Ambassador to the U.N. , Samar Sen : " The U.S. Government can simply explain that it is a question of 12 million Chinese or 750 million . " One possible U.S. strategy : to agree that Chinese admission is no longer an " important " question and can be settled by a simple majority vote , but to insist that Taiwan 's expulsion would be " important , " thus requiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the Nationalists were nevertheless about to be expelled , they would almost surely quit first .
