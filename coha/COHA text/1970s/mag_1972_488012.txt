DEAR SIRS : I 'll vote against George McGovern because of his guaranteed income proposal . I still believe this is a land of opportunity and I 'm against welfare . So stated a Mr. Richard Cain in the Sept. 3rd Oregonian , Portland . ' If the Richard CaMs of this land of opportunity are so opposed to welfare why do they support an Administration that bestows billions of dollars of welaie upon people who really do n't need it ? I refer to such items as the $250 million " Ician " subsidy to Lockheed . I refer to 500 large farmers in California 's Imperial Valley who received $12 million in farm payments last year . I refer to a recent Nixon-inspired Federal Power Commission ruling that allows the Tennessee Pipeline Company to shift costs of an unsuccessful project from the stockholders to the customers . I refer to a tax system which permitted one oil company to pay 1.2 per cent in federal taxes on nearly $1 billion in net income . , .. I could go on and on ad nauseam . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , omy receives money in the form of a federal subsidy , that is welfare . Every time a taxpayer avoids his fair share of federal taxes , that is welfare . . . . The Richard CaMs would like to believe they are independent of , the economic con ' ditions which result from the activities of industry and government . It is difficult for them to understand that they carry both the rich and the poor on their backs . . . . As a friend of mine recently put it , " There is nothing so pathetic as a poor Republican defending the system that is exploiting the hell out of him . " lames E. Larson end of a ride Delaware , Ohio DEAR SIRS : Your article by Richard Hebert " Amtrak : Asleep at the Switch , " Aug. 1 and the letters on the article in your September 18th issue prompt me to write to you . We used Amtrak in August of this year to travel from Columbus , Ohio to Washington , D.C. and back again . . . . At times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train or , by some mistake , had boarded a roller coaster . . . . We can attest to the fact that Amtrak has a long way to go before it can compare favorably with even the most primitive European trains . As we wrote Amtrak , we do not consider using its services again in the foreseeable future , but rather plan to spend our vacations in Europe where train , bus and ship travel is convenient , clean and dependable . We have made our views known to our Senators , William Saxbe and Robert Taft . . . It may also be of interest that the official who responded to our letter seemed addicted to military metaphors . He felt " encouraged " that , like the U.S. Army , they were going " to give it a real battle , " and were going to win . What troubles us is the thought : will this battle be won like the war on poverty , the war on crime , the war on inflation ? Can Amtrak see the light in the tunnel ?

More polls are being conducted than in 1968 or 1970 and the debate about what they mean is more intense than it was in either of those years , At times one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections and candidates . Most of the debate centers on the accuracy and meaning of the polls . Their effect receives much less attention although it isorshould be  --  of even greater concern . A variety of technical objections can be raised to the current polls , in particular the recent Yankelovich survey which gives Nixon a 62 to 23 per cent lead . This phase of the debate is for experts , although it is clear that in many instances sampling methods and the phrasing of questions can be criticized . Of greater importance is the obvious , but largely ignored , fact that national polls are essentially irrelevant or misleading . We do not have a system of national elections , in the sense , for example , that national elections are held in Great Britain . The federal government does not organize the election nor do the voters cast " national " ballots . Elections are conducted in the fifty states under the auspices of their state governments . Don Muchmore , the California polling expert , has been trying to make this point for years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter the media and the public  --  seem to be listening . The other day he explained to me why , in his view , national polls can be wide of the mark . To cite an obvious point : electoral votes do not necessarily correlate with the popular vote . In addition , the-vote for President and Vice President may be influenced by local political considerations and issues of special interest in a particular state . Mary Ellen Leary 's perceptive report in this issue ( p. 294 ) illustrates the point . Then , too , campaigns vary enormously in effec- tiveness from state to state and from city to city . In one state a strong campaign may be waged for a ticket , whereas in a neighboring state the campaign may be miserably directed . For this reason alone , polls of the Yankelovich variety should not be taken at face value . And there are still other considerations . As a result of recent polls , Nixon appears to be a shoo-in . One effect is to make it difficult for McGovern to raise funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate is presented by the media as the odds-on favorite . It can result in a low vote among his special constituencies . More important , it can mislead the pollsters . Muchmore put it to me this way : if voters get the feeling that A is certain to win ; while B is limping along and is or seems to be a " shaky " candidate ( his word ) , some of them will hesitate to say that they intend to vote for B , although that may be their secret intention . It is easier to appear to go along with what seems to be the majority . In addition , there is evidence that many voters resent the polls , and that some take a perverse pleasure in misleading the pollsters . The current polls are subject to discount for still another obvious but ignored consideration . Nixon is not liked ; he is not a popular leader . His support , as the polls show , is " thin " and hence could be easily shaken by some combination of untoward events between now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large lead , make it appear that the people love him , which is not the case even among those who intend to vote for him . This false " popularity " could boomerang . It is one thing to vote for a candidate for pragmatic reasons or merely because he is the incumbent ; but voters do not like to be told that they are " wild about Dick " when in fact they can scarcely stomach him . It is possible , also , that by concentrating on the large industrial states with big blocks of electoral votes , McGovern might be elected even though he cattle out second in the popular vote . The polls gave Nixon a wide margin in some small states in 1968 and he carried them by even larger margins ; but four states in which this happened yielded him only sixteen electoral ' votes . It should be evident that his lead in the polls is swollen by margins of preference in Southern states and in states with relatively small electoral votes . For all these reasons the " poll effect " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the most of the limited time that remains , his campaign needs a more unified direction and a sharper focus than it has yet enjoyed . Reports indicate that , in terms of field , organization , his staff is as good as it has been touted to be It knows how to conduct registration drives ; how to turn out crowds ; how to build local " volunteer " organizations  --  which , in many instances , are the best variety . But the same can not be said of his strategic command . Here McGovern conveys an impression of being pulled in three or four different directions on some issues . Only he can correct this situation . Above all , the strategy must be to assail Nixon and the record of his Administration . That the Administration is extremely vulnerable is best proven by the savagery with which the President , through surrogates , attempts to demolish critics who touch a sensitive nerve . The Nixon strategy is to keep McGovern on the defensive by stressing such " non-issues " as amnesty , abortion , bussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated in the Congress between now and November 7 ? and pot . But as Sen. Edward Kennedy will explain to Nation readers in an early issue , there are at least twenty-five good reasons why Nixon should be defeated . McGovern must identify these vulnerabilities and then pounce on them with the energy that , fitfully , he has shown he commands . Of these vulnerabilities the most important is the character of Richard M. Nixon , the easiest man to dislike and distrust who has occupied the White House in living memory . Apologists say , yes , he is tricky , opportunistic , conniving , etc. , but so was FDR . Perhaps , but with this difference : Roosevelt had a remarkable capacity to lead : he knew how to appeal to the best instincts of the people . Even Nixon apologists are often appalled by the debased quality ' - of- his leadership . He can make decisions but he can not ' rally public support for them . Because Roosevelt had some values which he cherished , he could communicate with people ; Nixon can not communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows it  --  and also because he distrusts popular judgment . Stewart Alsop , who is no critic of Nixon , concedes that the Watergate affair is " a snake that badly needs to be scotched  --  it is as nasty a business as Washington has seen for a long time " ( Newsweek , October 2 ) . But the snake is not likely to be scotched . For one reason , four years of the Nixon Adffinistration have spread cynicism , encouraged selfishness , besmirched idealism and downgraded the truth to a degree that makes Watergate seem merely more of the same . Joseph Kraft pointed out in a recent column that the President and'the men around him consistently " obscure moral issues . They reply forthrightly to charges not niade . When ' it happens to them to tell the truth , - the truth they tell is not the whole truth . " This behavior baffles Kraft . " I really do n't understand the constant disposition to hedge the truth , to be disingenuous , to con people . What I do understand is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Washington these days , and while I do n't suppose Nixon is entirely to blame , neither do I see how he can be altogether divorced from responsibility . " Precisely because there is " something dirty about Washington these days , " Nixon is the ultimate issue in the campaign . True , there are many other good reasons why he should be defeated but , above all , and finally , he should be defeated because he has sold us out ; he has debased our moral currency more than he has cut the value of the dollar . " Is anyone listening ? " asks Anthony Lewis in a plaintive column in The New York Times : " How many reckon the moral cost that will have to be paid for the violence in Vietnam ? " Well , we shall have an answer of sorts on November 7 . But in the meantime , one may well feel , as I do , that more American voters are listening than the polls indicate . CAREY MCWILLIAMS Politicalizing the FBI No matter how much one tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always comes up with hitherto unsuspected angles and maneuvers . Consider the appointment of L. Patrick Gray III as acting head of the FBI after the death of J. Edgar Hoover . It might have seemed that Hoover was as bad as they come and in some ways he was . As a right-wing " anti-Communist " demagogue he was without a peer . However , his influence and style of administration impartially favored the conservative-reactionary elements in the Democratic and Republican Parties alike . He played no favorites in his cries of alarm against the Red menace . When Gray was designated as Hoover 's successor , it sounded a bit odd . He must have had a mother and father , relatives and friends , but who else had ever heard of him ? Further research uncovered his service in the Navy , so he must have had comrades-in-arms . But there was little else to account , for his elevation to high office . But then , tucked away in the stories , was the information that Gray had long been an active political supporter of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phalanx of surrogates and , with an election coming up , what could have been more natural ( for Nixon ) than to add to his vocal supporters such a prominent figure as the director of the FBI ? At the time this idea could not have been offered as more than a perhaps unjust surmise , but events proved it true . On September 8 , Fred P. Graham reported in The New York Times that Gray had been making a series of political speeches , and that these sedulously echoed the Nixon line on a variety of topics , which did not necessarily relate to the policies or activities of the FBI . For instance , he opined in a speech on September 7 that the federal government was not spending too much on national defense , so-called , as compared with domestic programs . And when he did speak on Justice matters , one of his contentions proved to be that many court decisions " go to unreasonable lengths to protect the accused . " Perhaps so , but Gray cited the Supreme Court 's " exclusionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures . The Court is to consider this issue in its coming term , but that did not stop Gray froth commenting . There is more to it than speeches . The FBI was assigned to investigate the Watergate scandal , and now it is busy , on the smelly situation involving who knew what , and who got what , in the Soviet wheat purchases . When government officials leave to take jobs with an industry or company beneficially affected by actions in which they have participated or may have had advance notice , inquiry should be incisive and rigorous , and with a political appointee like Gray heading the FBI there may be some doubt that it will be . Gray has been adept at creating a faint image of " newness " and an intent to liberalize the FBI , as by letting an agent sport a properly trimmed mustache , wear colored shirts , and let his hair grow a bit longer ; but these matters - will scarcely affect the governance of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grapp , since 1964 head of the Bureau 's 500-agent Los Angeles office , Gray 's decision , has been simi- larly permissive . On a salary that never exceeded $36,000 a year , Grapp amassed assets of about $360,000 and involved himself in loans of more than $250,000 from five California lending institutions , one of which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy before it was merged with a more solvent institution . Grapp was allowed to retire . Hoover is entitled to his eternal rest , but we can think of more suitable successors than L. Patrick Gray III . What the Muggings Mean Dr. Wolfgang G. Friedmann was a distinguished authority on international law , a professor at Columbia University , loved and respected by faculty and students alike . As a young man , he had fought Hitler 's gangsters and escaped from Germany with his life . A few days ago , on a broad avenue three blocks from the university , in midafternoon , he was stabbed to death by three young men . He had given up his wallet but fought when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Three youths , two aged 16 , one 22 , have been taken into custody . So the nation is deprived of a leading scholar , a man of courage and conviction  --  incidentally one of the fifteen American legal authorities who put together the " Memorandum of Law " that the Lawyers ' Committee on the War in Vietnam circulated in the fall of 1965 in an attempt to halt escalation of the conflict . The social tragedy of such crimes is no less disturbing . Mugging  --  armed robbery in the streets  --  is the most feared of crimes . Not the most important , but the one that spreads a contagion of fear . It is what people mean when they inveigh against " crime in the streets . " It carries heavy undertones of racism and reaction , and has added in large measure to the afflictions of the cities . It is widely believed that mugging is part of the war of the criminal elements of the ghettos against the prosperous , but that is only one aspect . Actually , muggers prey extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interested in class warfare . That drug addiction has greatly complicated the problems of robbery and burglary is undeniable . It is equally obvious that if there were no slums there would be fewer crimes against persons and property , but if progress is being made in the eradication of urban ( and rural ) slums , it is not visible . On the contrary , what are well under way are strategies by the wealthy and well-to-do to protect themselves , and the devil take the hindmost . It is the modern equivalent of the moated castle and takes two forms  --  the ostensibly mugger-proof suburb , and the high-rise , self-contained city building whose tenants need never leave its confines , except perhaps with a bodyguard , and where no one can enter to menace them . Newsweek ( September 25 ) describes some of these fortresses . " On the outskirts of a score or more of the U.S. 's fastest growing cities , " we are told , " huge security-oriented subdivisions are springing up , some with all the characteristics of a Biblical walled city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , differ from their ancient prototypes in that they employ the resources of modern technology  --  computers , closed-circuit TV and other electronic devices ; locks with combinations instead of keys ; floodlighting , etc . Since mugging appears to be a specialty of black criminals , as white-collar crime is of Caucasians , blacks are particularly singled out for exclusion , but protection is not the only ground . " Blacks are getting closer to our community in the city all the time , " a businessman told Newsweek . " So I will be joining the crowd that 's fleeing Atlanta . I 'll stay with the group I get along with . That 's who I 'm going to live with , and I want to be sure to keep the others out . " He would be keeping them out even if they were as law-abiding as he considers himself to be . The social tragedy is that divisions within the society are widened by such measures ' and attitudes . The effect is to insulate the prosperous from the poor and discontented , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on the contrary , apprehensions and fears proliferate . The effect is to fragment society and to advertise its internal differences and tensions ? These could be reconciled , of course , but at a price the rich are not prepared to pay . Since the collapse of the civil rights movementspecifically since the riots of 1967 and the , assassination of Dr. King  --  nothing has happened to give slum dwellers any substantial reason for believing that relief or redress is in sight . Hence , as one result , the continuing aggravation of the drug problem and a kind of cold war between the haves and have-nots . A day after Professor Friedmann died , Selwyn Brody , a psychiatrist , was knifed on East 125th Street ; a week later , Herman B. Glaser , director of the New York Academy of Trial Lawyers , was beaten and robbed in the same area . Nor is New York the only American city to which the label " jungle " is now easily applied . And , of course , the President does nothing to provide national leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against " permissive " judges , but for him " crime in the streets " is more an issue to run upon than a problem to be diagnosed and cured . Nixon : The Only Issue The McGovern campaign is an uphill struggle ; that is to state the obvious . But some equaIly , obvious things are being ignored by the Democratic candidate and his aides . Richard Nixon 's hold on the loyalties of those hordes of white Americans who see in him a defender is based primarily on their paranoid fear and hatred of America 's blacks . That so many feel threatened by so few is one more evidence of the infinite irrationality of the species . But that irrationality is the point from which McGovern must start before it is too late . It is sad , but true , that the vast silent majority vote , even now being groomed for Spiro Agnew , does not care a whit about the bombing of dikes in North Vietnam ( Bill Buckley has spoken for them : Why were n't the dikes bombed earlier ? ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bill Buckley does not share their sentiments here ) ; is only mildly exercised about inflation ( and indeed may see it as the source of its real material prosperity ) and could n't care less about who bugged Watergate and why . What scares the white hordes pantsless is the jungle bunny , to use a homogenized epithet . And Nixon 's real harm to the country , present and potential , is what really disturbs a host of thinking people who are not at all excited by McGovern himself . Nixon 's return to the White House must be frustrated to prevent the total perversion of the federal judiciary , the utter demoralization of the executive departments and the increased sycophantization of the Congress . There is a slim chance that this can be done if Nixon can be presented as the amoral conniver he is , possessed of no concern at all for the fate or fears of the silent majority but willing to wear the mask of savior because , while it costs him nothing , it gives him everything . If McGovern and his aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American people , it is just possible that self-interest ( not the much-vaunted " basic decency " ) of Middle America will be touched sufficiently to serve its real interests instead of its prejudices . How can McGovern do it ? By ignoring the appeal of The New York Times , which is not read by Middle America , to disctiss the " issues " ? and by discussing the real and only issue , Richard Nixon . By discussing it loudly ; fully , with all the facts and figures . Nixon 's lies versus the truth . The point may carry . It is the only one with a chance of doing so . RICHARD A. LONG , Atlanta University Again No Peace Prize For the nineteenth time since the Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded in 1901 , no award will be made this year . It is assumed in Oslo that the committee was unable to find a worthy candidate . It may be that no candidate of worldwide status could be found this year  --  that is , no person whose activities for peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were available . In our issue of September 11 , Jeannette Rankin was named as a possibility ; she would have merited the award , though it is true that her services on behalf of peace are not as well known throughout the world as they should be . At about the time when word came over the wire that no Nobel award would be made this year , that most remarkable American , Ernest Gruening , our editorial associate and former editor , phoned to report that he had recovered from two major operations , was having dinner that evening with Senator McGovern , and was resuming his strenuous campaign speaking schedule . Gruening would be high on The Nation 's list of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize . He and Wayne Morse initiated the political opposition to the war in Vietnam when they were in the Senate . It does not detract from the record of McGovern , McCarthy and the others to say that Gruening and Morse were the first and most forceful and effective critics of the war . Both took the position , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only stupid and immoral but illegal , uncon stitutional and in violation of our obligations under the U.N . Charter . While Ernest Gruening may not be as well known in Belgrade and Singapore and Oslo as some recent recipients of the Nobel Prize , he is certainly as well known as Dr. Elise Ottesen-Jensen , the Swedish family planning expert , who is said to have been considered for the award this year . Speaking of family planning , one of Gruening 's most remarkable achievements in the Senate was the work he did in planning and conducting a splendid , many-volumed inquiry into population problems . The fact that no Nobel award will be made this year , despite the availability of such individuals as Jeannette Rankin and Ernest Gruening , suggests that we need an American Peace Prize . The ' Norwegians , who are not known for their belligerence , may well have been the logical sponsors of the first world peace prize ; they could be relied upon to make an objective canvass of available nominees . But an American Peace Prize might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in an environment that has been more militaristic than pacific , have carried on activities for peace which their fellow countrymen should be the first to acknowledge and applaud . In the social setting of the cold-war years , peace advocates have not been among the most highly rewarded or widely honored Americans . One of the foundations might well take the lead in setting up a representative committee which would annually award a prize to the American who , that year , had best served the cause of peace . Incidentally , the award should be substantial . Plaques are nice , but even nicer , after years of work in those barren peace vineyards , would be a check in five figures . There is no reason why the Norwegians should enjoy a monopoly on a good idea , the more so when they have so often been unable to find available nominees .
