txt HOUSTON  --  The flight of Apollo 16 began as a sleeper . The most exciting thing about the launch of the moonbound spacecraft last Sunday was not the thunder of its Saturn 5 booster or the trail of fire it drew across the blue Florida sky , but the enthusiasm Of Yevtushenko , the Soviet poet , who witnessed it . " It was beautiful , " he said . " It was poetry . " The interest was minimal in part because the Apollo project is so heavily engineered , with elaborate preflight checkouts and backup systems , that there tend to be few serious emergencies . But this mission has been marked by crises and moments of high drama . And television coverage ( with a camera controlled from earth ) has enabled millions to share in the irrepressible joy of the two astronauts as they explored the moon  --  and in the anguish of their failures . First there was the flaking paint . Early in the flight it became evident that paint was peeling off the aluminum skin of the lunar module in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paint , a brilliant white , was designed to keep the LM from overheating in the fierce sun that beats down on the moon . On earth , engineers debated the pros and cons of continuing with the mission . Since the launching had gone on schedule and the sun would be low on arrival at the site , they decided to continue as planned . Then on Thursday , after the spacecraft entered Dinar orbit , those here at Houston began worrying about possible strain on the astronauts ' hearts from the loss of potassium . A drastic loss of this vital substance had been discovered after the return of the three Apollo 15 astronauts . Two of them had experienced irregular heart performance during the mission . And now some abnormal  --  though not unexpected  --  heart beats were being recorded in biomedical data transmitted from the Apollo 16 crew . Potassium is a constituent of body cells that can be shed via the urine during times of stress . It is replaced by eating meat and certain fruits . Severe potassium loss leads to muscle weakening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muocles . Hence on this mission careful rec ? ords are being kept of the potassium intake of each astronaut . " Your potassium levels are running a little low , " Houston reported to the spacecraft Thursday , " and we 'd like to recommend that you drink some orange juice this morning . " Attempts of the astronauts to keep up on their potassium led to a variety of mishaps and , apparently , to other discomforts . At one point the microphone of Lieut . Col , Charles M. Duke Jr. , the LM pilot , hit the juice dispenser button and the liquid squirted into his helmet and droplets came adrift in the weightless environment of the cabin . After he and the spacecraft 's commander , Capt . John W. Young , had crawled aboard the LM for their descent to the moon Houston began worrying about that helmet . " There 's a few people that just want to make sure they washed it out with water to get that orange juice out before he puts that antifogging stuff in there . " To keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of peaches . " You 'll be happy to know , " said one of the LM crewmen , " that we shared our peaches with Casper . " ( " Casper " is the radio call of Lieut . Comdr . Thomas K. Mattingly , the command module pilot . ) " He ate about as much of them as we did . " " Roger . Copy , " said the voice from Houston . " That sounds kind of like it did n't work out too well . " " There 's a lot of peaches still on Casper 's face . I 'll tell you that . Like when you open that can you get them all at once . " There were tense moments when it appeared , briefly , that the landing might have to be called off . At one point it seemed that the radar used to control the LM landing was inoperative . Another time warning lights reported a gimbal lock ? a dreaded malfunction of the control system in which one unit turns beyond its designed limit and locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was false . The most serious crisis , however , originated behind the moon , when Commander Mattingly , alone in the command module , tried to fire its big rocket engine to circularize his orbit after disengaging from the LM . Before firing the rocket he had gone through his usual checks , much like a plane pilot before take-off . Among these was testing the systems for adjusting the aim of the rocket engine . Basically this engine is aimed by turning the entire spacecraft , but it is mounted on gimbals so that it can be adjusted as much as four degrees either in pitch ( up and down ) or in yaw ( right or left ) . This corrects for the effect of changes in the vehicle 's center of gravity as it burns fuel . For the final great thrust homeward from the moon the burn lasts two and a half minutes and the weight loss is substantial . Hence to get them home this system will be vital . Commander Mattingly found that when he tested the backup yaw control the engine wobbled sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be no firing of the rocket unless its backup system was working , as well as its primary system . The outlook was bleak . Commander Mattingly was told to maneuver his craft back close to the LM so that , if necessary , a redocking could be carried out for an immediate return to earth . The return thrust could be achieved with the LM 's descent engine , as was done during the crisis mission of Apollo 13 . Meanwhile , there were urgent huddles of engineers here and at other centers , including the North American Rockwell plant at Downey , Calif. , prime contractor for the spacecraft . Realistic tests of engine wobbling , such as that observed by Commander Mattingly , were impossible in the short time left before a decision was essential . The moon was slowly turning inside the orbit of the two spacecraft and within a few hours a landing at the planned site would no longer be possible . It was found , however , that engineering tests had been performed that , the engineers said , indicated the observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their " go " for a landing . Since then the mission has been dominated by the exuberance of the two astronauts on the moon . " This is super " cried Colonel Duke at one point , in a manner highly contagious to those listening a quarter of a million miles away . Perhaps their excitement was to some extent an impediment . As Colonel Duke hastened across the lunar landscape a package of instruments slipped off his carrying pole and rolled down into a small crater . It was retrieved . Then Captain Young caught a cable on his boot and cut the connection for the instruments that were to measure the flow of heat from the lunar interior . These were setbacks in which millions shared . But also shown were the achievements ? operation of the miniature astronomical observatory , extraction of an eight-foot cross-section of lunar surface material , the setting up of an array of scientific instruments that , apart from the heat flow experiment , all seemed to be working well . Also collected is a rich harvest of specimens that should reveal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a large part of the lunar highlands . No one here , out loud , is questioning the decision to land . But the final test of that decision will come at 1:24 A.M. EST Tuesday after the astronauts have rejoined Commander Mob tingly in the command module , have aimed it into an earth-bound trajectory and fired its big rocket . - VV/31.1- =12 , SUL-LI-VAN
