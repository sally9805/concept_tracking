The background of the campaign debate over economics is a recovery that is progressing faster than most economists had expected . The Government this week will release its estimate of first-quarter real gross national product ( total output of goods and services , discounted for inflation ) ; it is expected to show a 6% to 7% gain at an annual rate . Retail sales jumped 2.8% in March , on top of a 1.6% rise in February ; auto sales in the first ten days of April leaped 33% above the 1975 period . Industrial production rose by only .6% in March , but the January and February advances were revised upward to .8% and .7% respectively . <P> The figures point to a healthy , not wild recovery-but do contain a promise of further acceleration in the months to come . The fast pace of consumer spending and sales is keeping businessmen from rebuilding the inventories they slashed deeply last year . If sales stay strong , retailers will have to step up their orders for new goods to rebuild stockpiles so that they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Result : production increases later this year that will be larger than expected . <P> The good news has caused the Ford Administration to revise its forecasts for the year slightly upward . It now expects real G.N.P . to rise 6.5% during all of 1976 and unemployment to drop below 7% by year 's end . Earlier , official forecasts had anticipated a 6.2% G.N.P . increase and a year-end unemployment rate of 7% to 7.5% ( the jobless rate had already dropped to 7.5% last month ) . Though the Administration does not intend to give its new predictions an official stamp , it is making no secret of its delight . Says Secretary of the Treasury William Simon : " This economy is so good there is almost nothing we could do to screw it up before the end of the year . " <P> Simon is being too exuberant . There is a darker side to the picture : the Administration is forecasting a 6% inflation rate not only for 1976 , but for 1977 and 1978 as well . For this year , such a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long a period as three years a 6% inflation pace is clearly far too rapid . Yet the Administration 's chances of reducing it have been lessened by its own labor policy , as exemplified by the Teamsters settlement early this month that ended a two-day strike ( TIME , April 12 ) . <P> Consistent with Inflation . Some White House officials put pressure on Secretary of Labor W.J. Usery , acting as a mediator , to get the strike settled . He did , but at the price of a contract that will raise wages and benefits 33% between now and 1979 . President Ford declared that the settlement " does fit into our overall economic plans and forecasts for the next three years . " That is the trouble : a 33% raise is indeed perfectly consistent with a continuing inflation rate of 6%.
