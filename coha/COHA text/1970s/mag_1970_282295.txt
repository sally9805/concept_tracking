If politics makes strange bedfellows , it also makes some fickle lovers . That , at least , is the suggestion conveyed in a new book on the President 's political comeback by Jules Witcover , veteran Washington reporter for the Los Angeles Times . In The Resurrection of Richard Nixon ( G.P. Putnam 's Sons ) , Witcover maintains that former Texas Governor John Connally , a power in the state and Lyndon Johnson 's closest political ally , actually worked secretly through most of the campaign to raise money for Nixon while publicly ignoring Hubert Humphrey . <P> Then , according to Witcover , with less than a week to go before Election Day , Connally apparently came to believe that Humphrey would carry the state . So Connally leaped on the bandwagon and finally bestowed public blessings on his own party 's candidate at a huge Houston rally . Johnson too , after immobilizing himself and his entire Cabinet during most of the campaign , appeared at the rally . He also loosened some Texas money that had been withheld from Humphrey . The support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quid pro quo for Connally 's help , the story goes , was a strong , implied promise that he would become Secretary of Defense-Nixon wanted a Democrat for the job-if the Republicans carried Texas and won . Although Texas had been regarded as leaning toward Nixon shortly before the vote , Humphrey took its 25 electoral votes , but by only 39,000 out of 3.1 million votes cast . Witcover quotes a Nixon insider as saying after the campaign that Connally could have gotten the Defense job if " he had had a few more guts , " meaning if he had not switched . <P> Is the story true ? Connally calls it " worse than inaccurate ; it 's a lie . " Among those ready to believe it are many of Humphrey 's staff who have long felt that Johnson secretly wanted a Nixon victory so that history would record the Democrats ' unpopularity rather than Johnson 's . They reason that Connally would not have made the deal without Johnson 's knowledge . <P> Believers could also find support for the story in some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connally was outraged at the Democratic Convention when Humphrey agreed to drop the unit rule for delegate voting , a source of power for Connally , and would not even consider the Texan for a running mate . Connally and Allan Shivers , also a former Texas Governor and like Connally a conservative , were planning to go on television shortly before the election to announce their support of Nixon . They changed their minds at about the same time that Connally , according to Witcover , was changing candidates .
