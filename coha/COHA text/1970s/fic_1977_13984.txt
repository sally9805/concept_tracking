As lights come up she is discovered , standing next to bed L. C. Her dance consists of various movements illustrating her functions . DANCER A dance . To functioning . In this dance I celebrate the mundane . Waking ! Getting out of bed ! Exercise ! Coffee ! Bathing ! Dressing ! ( Bernard enters u . R. door , crosses toward dancer , they freeze , stare at each other trying to make contact , fail , then Bernard crosses to u . L. and sits , the dancer sits D. L. C. ) HOOKED ON NICE BERNARD It has n't always been easy . Once I was rotten . I looked rotten . I thought rotten . I could tell by the way people stared away from me that they were thinking  --  " There goes a rotten kid . " So I made a decision to convert . I studied to be nice . At first it was pure affectation . Outside I did favors , lent money , smiles a lot . But inside , I stayed rotten . But give niceness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses D. L. above barrel . ) Niceness ran amok inside of me . I became a Saint ! When I came into a room people 's eyes teared . I got dependent on it . I got nicer and nicer ! Even when it was n't required , I was nice . Guys would n't talk sex in front of me . Girls began to think of me as a friend . I gave my analyst guilt feelings . ( He crosses back to ledge . ) I tried to cut down but I had lost the power of choice . I was hooked on nice ! ( Grins . ) Not that I 'm complaining , mind you . ( He sits. ) p. 3 BERNARD/GROWNUP Man 1 enters behind u . L. ledge and stands by opening . GROWNUP How do you do , Mr. Mergendeiler . I 'm your grownup . BERNARD You 're my what ? GROWNUP ( Man 1 crosses to ledge and sits next to Bernard . ) Surely you 've always wanted a grownup . Somebody who takes care of those petty day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who handles them cleanly and efficiently . Somebody who will not allow your insurance to lapse , your rent to fall over due , your car to break down . Somebody who will not be nervous about calling the landlord about repairs , the girl friend about breaking a date , the boss about a needed raise . In other words , somebody who is trained to do all those adult things too many of us have been asked to do since childhood and still ca n't quite manage . ( Man 1 crosses to L. stoop . ) Somebody who is willing and happy to stand on your own two feet for you , to fight all your battles , to make all your difficult decisions , i.e.  --  your grownup ! BERNARD You mean I wo n't have to make a decision ever again ? GROWNUP Once in your employ , I , your grownup , will make all of them . BERNARD ( Bernard rises , shakes Man 1 's hand . ) It 's unbelievable ! It 's what I 've dreamed of all my life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 GROWNUP Gee , I do n't know . ( Man 1 sits , hand still extended . ) What do you think I 'm worth ? ( Bernard drops his hand and sits on u . L. ledge . ) CHRISTMAS PRESENT Woman 1 enters u . R. door with shirt box , D. L. C. to dancer and addresses her . WOMAN I want to return this Christmas present . ( She hands box to dancer . ) My husband gave it to me . It 's the wrong color . It 's the wrong size . It 's the wrong present . And he 's the wrong husband . Every Christmas I realize that . ( She crosses R. , away from dancer , dancer puts box on forestage . ) TALK TOO MUCHI talk too much . I 'm quite bright , so it 's interesting , but nevertheless , I talk too much . You see , already I 'm saying more than I should . Men hate it for a woman to blurt out , " I 'm bright . " They think she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a matter of fact , that is what I 'm saying . I 'm brighter than even the brightest men I know . That 's why it 's a mistake to talk too much . Men fall behind and feel challenged and grow hostile . So when I 'm very attracted to a man I make it a point to talk more slowly than I would to one of my woman friends . And because I guide him along gently from insight to insight he ends up being terribly impressed with his own brilliance . And with mine for being able to keep up with him . And he tells me I 'm the first woman he 's ever met who 's as interesting as one of his boy friends . ( She sits R. C. , on bed . ) That 's love . p. 5 YOU NEVER COME NEAR ME Woman 2 enters u . L. behind ledge and crosses to Man 1 . WIFE You never come near me anymore . HUSBAND ( Man 1 rises , and backs away from her . ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) There 's a gulf widening between us .

WIFE I must know where I stand . HUSBAND ( He stands by the u . R. ledge . ) I 'm as close to you as ever . WIFE Then say the words I want to hear . HUSBAND I love you . I always love you . ( He sits and moves carton and bags in front of him . ) WIFE Thank you , my darling . Thank you . ( Woman 2 sits , Man 1 puts a small brown paper bag over his head. ) p. 6 PAPER BAG HUSBAND I wear a paper bag over my head . When I 'm happy , I wear a red paper bag . ( Puts red bag over 1st bag . ) When I 'm depressed I wear a blue paper bag . ( Puts blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear a brown paper bag . ( Puts brown bag over blue bag . ) When I feel grand I wear a carton . ( Puts a carton over brown bag . ) Yet people insist on telling me I 'm afraid of showing emotion . How else do you show emotion ? SETTLING FOR 2ND BEST Woman 1 crosses to u . R. ledge and sits next to Man 1 . 2ND WIFE All the marriages we know  --  HUSBAND Cracking up  --  2ND WIFE Four last month  --  HUSBAND Two the month before  --  2ND WIFE All our age  --  HUSBAND All married about the time we were  --  2ND WIFE The husbands drinking too much  --  HUSBAND The wives going back into analysis  --  2ND WIFE The wives becoming more assertive . p. 7 HUSBAND That husbands becoming bitter . 2ND WIFE Makes you wonder how we 've survived . HUSBAND Never fighting . 2ND WIFE Never drinking  --  HUSBAND Never going back into analysis  --  2ND WIFE I guess it 's because we do n't love each other  --  HUSBAND A lot to be said for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carton and exits u . R. door . ) FIXATIVE FIXATIVE LADY First thing I do every day is get up and put on my body . ( Woman 2 crosses D. C. ) Next , I screw on my head , clip in my eyes , paste on my nose and cut out a hole for my mouth . Then I spray the whole thing with fixative and go to work . By midmorning my eyes are gone . By noon , I 've lost the use of my mouth . By late afternoon , I can hardly breathe through my nose . By quitting time , the only thing still working is my body . I drag it home and give it a bath . It wakes up . I give my head a drink . ( She crosses to u . R. door . ) It wakes up . My date comes . I spray on some fixative and we go out dancing . He calls me his dream girl . ( She exits u . R. , Bernard crosses to L. step and sits. ) p. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " Dance to 1977 , " picking up the key moments of her dances of previous years . DANCER A dance to 1977 . This year 's dance attempts a more sophisticated approach than my dances of previous years . It rejects the too easy alienation of my dance of ' 76 . It eliminates the stylish disillusion of my dance of ' 75 . It shuns the boastful non-conformity of my dance of ' 74 . It denies the egocentric idealism of my dances of ' 73 , ' 72 , ' 71 , and ' 70 . This year 's dance is strictly pragmatic . Realistic in its appraisal of the world , unsentimental in its summing up of my position in it . A dance to 1977 . ( She crosses to large crate in one quick movement , turns it over and doubles up inside it , head first , feet sticking out . ) DEPENDENT , INDEPENDENT Woman 2 enters u . L. door , crosses to bed and sits D. C. INDEPENDENT WOMAN Most men want me to be dependent . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent , I pick the wrong men to depend on and they betray me . On the other hand , when I 'm independent I attract the wrong kind of men who get so dependent on me that in order to break free I betray them . Some day I 'll meet a man who wo n't be dependent and wo n't expect me to be dependent . And he wo n't betray me . And I wo n't betray him . And that will be love . ( She ( Removes bags and carton , and glares at Independent Woman . Woman 2 . ) You have cottage cheese on your chin . Why do n't you ever wipe your chin after you eat ? You 're thirty-one years old . You 're old enough to learn to use a napkin . You 're thirty-one years old , you 've started to get wrinkles . ( Man 1 comes to Woman 2 . ) It does n't help when there 's cottage cheese along with the wrinkles . And if it 's not cottage cheese , it 's egg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . And if it 's not on your cheek , it 's on your nose . And if it 's not on your nose , it 's in your hair . How do you manage to get it in your hair ? ( He crosses D. L. to barrel and sits . ) I 'm sorry , but I ca n't take it anymore . A supposedly mature woman with all that cottage cheese , egg and tuna fish on your chin and your nose and your hair . I want a divorce . ( She crosses to u . R. ledge and sits . ) I READ A BOOK Woman 1 puts head through curtains . BED LADY Listen , world ! ( Woman 1 comes through window and sits on bed , she is wrapped in a quilt . Man 1 exits u . L. door . ) You know what I did today ? I read a book  --  O.K. , I started to read a book ! Yes , I did ! A big book , world ! A classic ! I picked it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know how far I got before my mind began to wander ?

How lucky can one girl be ? p. 10 FRAUD BERNARD ( To Woman . ) Fraud . ( Woman 1 withdraws , Bernard crosses D. C. ) Families are a fraud . Friends are a fraud . Work is a fraud . Faith is a fraud . Love : ( Woman 2 embraces Bernard , they cross to bed and sit D. C. ) When you get together with one other person to protect yourselves against fraud . AND WHAT DID I SAY NEXT BERNARD ( Holding his head , desperately hung over . Woman 2 is holding her arms around him . ) And what did I say next ? GIRLFRIEND You told me you loved me and were sorry for the way you treated me . Do n't you remember ? BERNARD Oh sure . Sure . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wanted to go on a ferry ride , do n't you remember ? You apologized to me all the way  --  both ways . BERNARD Oh , that 's right . Sure . Then I took you home . GIRLFRIEND No . Do n't you remember ? We could n't find a taxi and you said it was your fault because you were such a rotten guy and you began to cry . BERNARD ( Defensive . ) I 'm not sure I remember that . p. 11 GIRLFRIEND And I said you were a lonely guy and you just had a little too much to drink and why not , everybody has a right on New Year 's Eve . BERNARD That 's a very understanding thing to say . GIRLFRIEND Then you asked me to marry you . Remember ? Remember ? ( She turns him toward her . ) Bernard , do you or do n't you remember ? ( She exits u . R. , furious . ) BERNARD What a terrifying way to start a year . ( He crosses to u . R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JERRY DOWN AT THE OFFICE Man 1 enters u . L. door . BOSS Jerry down at the office , he 's fooling around behind his wife 's back with Renee the book-keeper . ( He sits L. C. on bed . ) You know what I tell him ? WIFE John , I 'm going crazy . BOSS ( He ties his shoe . ) I say to him : " Jerry , I do n't understand you guys who go fooling around with other women . My Joanie is six different kinds of women and that 's enough for one man .

BOSS So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be for John tonight ? WIFE Myself . BOSS Why , when I 'm in such a good mood , do you have to start a fight ? ( They both rise angrily , she exits u . R. door , he crosses to u . L. ledge and sits . ) IMPRESSED WITH ME BERNARD I always used to notice girls on the bus if they were writing in a notebook . ( He takes out his notebook . ) I 'd figure they were writers and I 'd want to go over and start a conversation about how I used to write a lot in school . And I was going to do it again someday . And they 'd be able to tell from the way I talked and my personal charm and everything that if I ever wanted to I could be a very good writer . ( He rises , crosses to R. C. of bed and sits . ) And just to show them that I was n't a lot of hot air I 'd say names to them  --  like " Updike " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , so they 'd begin to trust me and let me look at what they 'd written . And it would be great ! Really great ! Not quite as great as what I could write if I ever got around to it . Less great , but great . And I 'd make a few criticisms  --  you know , about sentence structure ( Woman 2 enters u . L. door and sits u . L. on bed. ) things that would show that I knew what I was talking about . And when they 'd get off the bus they 'd be surprised because instead of getting off with them I 'd say : " Good-bye . " And then they 'd know that I was n't just a phoney trying for a pickup and they 'd be very impressed with me . And that 's all I 'd want . I just want somebody to be impressed with me . ( Woman 2 slides D. on bed , Bernard turns to her. ) p. 13 ME , ME , ME , I BERNARD ( Conversationally to Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . GIRLFRIEND ( WOMAN 2 ) . I  --  ( Bernard yawns , Woman 2 collapses to floor . ) BRANDS HUSBAND I used to read them ads  --  know what I mean ? " Even your best friend wo n't tell you " ads  --  and it used to bother me because if you 're a right guy  --  nice to your mother and everything  --  what kind of girl is it who 'd throw you over because of the wrong toothpaste you used  --  or what kind of phoney friend is it who 'd spend his time not drinking with you but smelling you ? And then it would bother me how these people in the ads would become popular overnight by changing brand names . ( He rises and crosses D. L. to barrel and sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were n't better people . But suddenly they 'd switch brands and become pride of the regiment . Well this used to bother me because , frankly , people never have taken to me . Like at the job the only desk during breaks where you ca n't hear a steady buzz-buzz of conversation is mine . Nobody ever comes over to me ! I always got to go over to them . All my life . When I was a kid and three of us would walk down the street ? I 'd never be in the middle . I 'd always be on the gutter side . I never got invited to join up with any clubs . I went through the entire army without once being invited to play cards . And I admit sometimes I used to wake up in the middle of the night dripping sweat  --  and going on and off in my head like a big neon sign was  --  " Bad breath , underarm odor , bad breath . " I got married and my wife treated me like a janitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that I 'm good with my hands . When the other wives boasted about their husbands ' talents she 'd call me in to fix the sink . So at parties I 'd do my famous " fixing the sink bit " and the rest of the time we were acquaintances . And more and more in the back of my head it went  --  " Change your soap . Change your toothpaste . " But  --  I do n't know  --  I always felt that I 'm me for better or worse . I 'm me ! Then my kids who my wife says are at a sensitive age began to make insensitive cracks . So I finally gave in . I changed my brand of toothpaste , my brand of hair oil , my brand of soap and my suit style . And son of a gun , the ads were right ! My wife adored me . The kids loved me . Suddenly everybody was my buddy for the first time in my life ! Three weeks of it was all I could take . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brand over me the hell with them . ( He rises and crawls into bed. ) p. 14 I 'LL DIE Woman 1 enters u . L. door , she arcs , to D. R. corner of bed in the course of the piece . VIRGIN Monday : I met the cutest boy . All night long he told me I was afraid of life . If he calls me , I 'll die . Tuesday : He called me for a date . All night long he confused me about who I am . If he likes me , I 'll die . Wednesday : He says he loves me . All night long he warned me he 'd hurt me . If he touches me , I 'll die . Thursday : He wants to marry me . All night long he told me living with my mother was a stifling experience . If I say yes to him , I 'll die . Friday : I said yes .

On the way to church I 'll die . Sunday : We 're married . Tonight I die . Monday : He eats like a pig . He drinks like a fish . He slept the whole morning away . ( She sits D. R. on bed . ) I guess I wo n't die . LOSS OF INNOCENCE DANCER ( Dancer rises , and dances throughout piece . ) A dance to the loss of innocence . ( She crosses D. L. ) In this dance I have symbolized youth , its hopes , its wishes , its dreams . Its choice of friends , of lovers , of gods . Youth  --  bright and eager to search life for its meaning ( She stands u . L. on bed. ) certain in the knowledge that it will find that meaning . And then comes disillusion . The disappointment of friends  --  the inadequacy of lovers ( She steps over Man 1 and crosses R. of bed. ) the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no one who does n't lie  --  there is nothing incorruptible . They 're all cheats and out to get you ! Do n't believe a single one of the no good dirty  --  Forget it . ( She crosses to u . R. corner of bed and sits . ) I do n't feel like dancing . p. 15 STILL I BELIEVE IT Woman 2 rises and crosses D. L. to barrel and sits . GIRLFRIEND I 'm always right about everything . I can always tell which friends will betray me moments before I put my trust in them . Still I trust them . I know in my bones what a man 's going to try with me as soon as we lift our first drink . Still I drink it . I can tell the instant I make new promises to myself that I intend to break them . Still I make them . I know the second people say I 'm doing better that they must be lying ; Still I believe them . ( She crosses D. C. to bed , sits and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of every experience before I begin it . Still I begin it . For me , getting out of bed in the morning is an act of false confidence . I HATE MYSELF , BEGIN AGAIN WOMAN 1 I hate myself . I hate myself . I hate myself . I dislike myself . I like myself . I like myself . I like myself . I like myself . I like myself ! I love myself ! ( Recoils . ) Begin again . ( She dashes out u . L. door , followed out by Man 1 and Woman 2 , the Dancer exits u . R. leaving Bernard alone on stage . ) BREAD CRUMBS BERNARD ( Bernard rises , crosses D. C. throwing imaginary bread crumbs . ) So I 'm going out with this girl for the first time and we 're going to the movies and , as usual , I 'm throwing out my bread crumbs . And she asks me what is it that I 'm doing and I tell her that I 'm throwing out bread crumbs so I can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . ( He sits D. C. on bed . ) So she laughs like it 's a big joke and I say I do n't see why my personal troubles should make such a big joke . And she said , " Look "  --  do n't worry  --  I 'll take you home ! " So I got mad . I said , " Look  --  we each have our own way of finding ourselves . Who is to say yours is better than mine ? " And she said , " You ca n't make a whole life 's philosophy out of bread crumbs . " So right out on the street we had a fight . ( He crosses u . R. ) And I got so mad I walked away and I completely forgot to follow my bread crumbs . And an amazing thing happened  --  I had no trouble getting home . It seems to make my whole past life invalid . ( He exits u . R. door. ) p. 16 BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS Laughter is heard off L. , Man 1 and Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , he is carrying a key . He is telling the following joke as they enter . " So the girl on the answering service says the guy says he 's your brother Harvey . I said it ca n't be Harvey , Harvey knows I do n't make house calls . Turns out it was Harvey . Am I my brother 's doctor ? " Woman 1 responds . " Hell no , he 's in Acapulco . " ( Both laugh . ) MALE CONVENTIONEER ( Woman 1 hands him glass and takes key , she places it on barrel and crosses to bed and sits . He crosses to her says " He 's in Acapulco " takes her glass from her and stacks both glasses and places them on barrel , he crosses back to her , sizes her up . ) Now look , before anything happens between us  --  I 've got to tell you something and hope that it wo n't make a difference . WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Oh , it ca n't be all that serious . MALE CONVENTIONEER I 'm married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONVENTIONEER Well  --  what do you think ? WOMAN CONVENTIONEER About what ? ( He sits . ) MALE CONVENTIONEER About us ! Does it make a difference to you ? The fact that I 'm married that is ? p. 17 WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Of course not , why should it ? MALE CONVENTIONEER Why should it ? ( He rises , shocked . ) Why should n't it ? You may have the wrong idea about me  --  I do n't play around a hell of a lot ! WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Honey , honest it does n't matter in the least to me . MALE CONVENTIONEER Oh , it does n't does it . ( He backs up . ) Well maybe this will . I love my wife very much ! WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Marvelous ! Are there any kids ? MALE CONVENTIONEER I do n't know what you 're trying to pull but as long as I 've gone this far you may as well know the complete truth  --  to me you 're a one night adventure ! WOMAN CONVENTIONEER And that 's what you are to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MALE CONVENTIONEER You  --  married ? WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Sure . MALE CONVENTIONEER I  --  I did n't know . WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Want to see my kids ? ( She crosses u . L. , as she does , he dodges D. C. ) MALE CONVENTIONEER No  --  no ! For godsakes  --  please do n't ! p. 18 WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Look , sugar  --  you want to forget the whole thing ? MALE CONVENTIONEER You wo n't think I 'm unmanly ? ( She crosses to him and puts her arms around him . ) WOMAN CONVENTIONEER Honey , to me you 're a tiger . ( He crosses to above large crate after taking one last look at her . ) MALE CONVENTIONEER What a truly wonderful woman . If I were n't happily married  --  that little girl 's husband would have to look out . ( He crosses to u . R. ledge , and sits , she crosses to L. stoop and sits . ) LOVE FRANK AGAIN Woman 2 enters u . R. door , crosses to bed and sits R. C. CONVENTIONEER 'S WIFE By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business trip for a month I had lost all feeling for him . Each dinner when he 'd come I 'd try to rekindle the flame , but all I could think of as he gobbled up my chicken was : " All I am is a servant to you , Frank . " So when he announced he had to go away I was delighted . While Frank was away I could find myself again ! I could make plans ! The first week Frank was away I went out seven times . The telephone never stopped ringing . I had a marvelous time ! The second week Frank was away I got tired of the same old faces , same old lines . I remembered what drove me to marry Frank in the first place . The third week Frank was away I felt closer to him than I had in years . I stayed home , read Jane Austen and slept on Frank 's side of the bed . The fourth week Frank was away I fell madly in love with him . I hated myself for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Frank came home . The minute he walked in and said , " I 'm back , darling ! " ( She backs D. R. and sits on large crate . ) I withdrew . I can hardly wait for his next business trip so I can love Frank again . p. 19 SO I DRINK Bernard enters u . L. door , he crosses to D. L. barrel , picks up glasses and sits . ) BERNARD Sometimes I feel small . And sometimes I feel larger than life . Sometimes I feel crushed . And sometimes I feel like a king . Sometimes I feel slow . And sometimes I feel like a wit . But most of the time I feel just like me . So I drink . ( He swirls his glass , drinks , looks at Woman 2 , crosses to her and hands her a glass , she moves D. on crate . ) EXPLODE/BOMBS BERNARD ( To girlfriend , Woman 2 . ) So the first date we exploded together like a couple of bombs . Talked about everything ! Most exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked half the night away discussing our first date . She told me all of her insights about me . I disclosed all of mine about her . On our third date we analyzed how we both acted on our second date  --  why we both were a little tense  --  why we both were afraid of disappointment . On our fourth date we examined carefully all that had happened on our third date  --  the obvious competitiveness  --  the growing hostility . ( Bernard crosses D. L. , Woman 2 follows him . ) On our fifth date we spent the night taking apart the fourth date . She pointed out my self pity and I promised to correct it . I pointed out her air of domination . She promised to correct it . On our sixth date we focused for the course of the evening on our fifth date  --  our mutual anxiety  --  our use of self exposure to keep us from physical contact . On our seventh date we went to a movie . I loved it . She hated it . I never realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to a party . Met a marvelous girl ! We exploded together like two bombs .

I had no idea she was such a passionate person ! ( A second kiss . ) This could be something good . I could use something good right now . Something to build up my pride  --  my self-esteem  --  with all the rotten ( His massaging of her back turns into a pounding. ) back-biting going on down at the office . I swear I 'm not going to stand for much more of it . I deserve some credit . Not that my family would ever admit it . Not them ! They never wait to hear my side . ( He pounds her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever you turn somebody 's sitting in judgement . It 's just like in the movie tonight when Paul Newman said to Sophia Loren  --  ( They kiss again , she breaks away . ) GIRLFRIEND I  --  I 'd better go in , Bernard .

( He slides D. on bed . ) After seven years I said to Sylvia , " All we ever talk about is money and I 've come to the conclusion you 're not my dream girl . " So I left Sylvia to think things over . What I decided was that while Sylvia had her shortcomings she still had a better body than all my friends ' wives . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's Sylvia ? " I demanded . " I 'm Sylvia , " she said . So I threw her out ! ( Knocking is heard coming from L. door , Man 1 backs u. on bed . ) I do n't care how long she knocks , I 'm not letting in any strangers until the Sylvia I settled for comes home .

WIFE I go out on the street late at night  --  to an empty spot  --  where there are no lights  --  and no people  --  and no houses where strangers can look out their windows  --  and catch me . And when I 'm sure I 'm absolutely alone  --  I make faces . ( She makes three faces , R. , C. , L. , the last face is seen by Bernard .
