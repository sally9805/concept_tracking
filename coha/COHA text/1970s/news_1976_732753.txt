txt Even many of its critics consider Britain an admirable country : the mother of modern democracy and modern industry , a peaceful country of backyard rose gardeners and unarmed cops that has produced more than its share of scientists , statesmen , poets and even eminent economists . Yet Britain swirls in economic chaos . As inflation persists and the pound falls , Britons have been getting poorer for two years straight , and they are likely to keep getting poorer for years to come . Today , Britons suffered still another buffeting from what seems a never ending avalanche of bad news . The coal miners ' union voted to strike , although it then postponed the move ; British industry ran up another big deficit in foreign trade , and , once again , the pound fell . Page D-1.1 " Britain is fundamentally less able to develop than other countries , " said a Dutch official at the European Economic Community headquarters in Brussels . It is a country that simply does n't work very well . Why that is so is a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of the empire , on which British industry was built , and the dislocations of two world wars . Another easy answer Is an enigmatic malady known as " the British disease , " a catch-all diagnosis , like consumption . Its symptoms include boredom , lethargy , and a good-humored I 'm  --  all-right-Jack acceptance of irredeemable decline . Foreigners who know Britain well take T. KILBORN New York Times a harsher view . They see Britain 's weakness in acute social divisions , the country 's confrontation politics , and peculiarities of the British character that clash with the world of commerce . During a day-long debate in the House of Commons this week on the state of the economy , Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey said his program of pay restraints and public spending cuts was Coninued on Page AI I , Col. I News Analysis Amid Economic Chaos , Britons Ask ThemselvesWhy System No Longer Seems to Work // working . Indeed , because of the program , Britain is clearly better off than it was a little over a year ago when the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fly in the Ointment Rut like so many earlier attempts to revive the economy , Mr. Healey 's program began to leak a few weeks . ago . To save it , he explained , he had to ask the International Monetary Fund for a gargantuan $3.9 billion loan and has had to make money so expensive that a home mortgage now costs an unheard of 12 percent . A Liberal Party member of Parliament undoubtedly spoke rot . millions of his countrymen in interpreting the Chancellor to mean that Britain 's situation was " hopeless but not serious . " Germany and France , countries with roughly as many people as Britain , came out . of World War II crippled by bombs or occupation . In the years since then , both have prospered while Britain has slept and the pound has slumped , from $4 to $1.64 . Over the last two decades , the British economy has grown less than 3 percent annually , the slowest rate in the West , while the economies of most other industrial countries have grown at least twice as fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better products to compete in world markets . British industry , relatively unscathed by the war , clung to its old factories and old products . Where the Money Goes Ohe result was slumping productivity , the sales a company achieves per year per worker . British Leyland , the nationalized automobile company , realizes sales of $12.000 per worker , a study last year by The Financial Times found , while Volkswagen and Volvo get twice as much . Meanwhile , Britain 's trade declined . Another study showed that 20 years ago , Britain supplied 30 percent of the manufactured goods sold throughout the world and sells less than 8 percent now . Germany 's share , by contrast , has climbed , from about 19 percent to 22 percent . Less money was coming into Britain , and a country that was once a lender to the world became the biggest borrower . Successive British governments took much of the money that might have gone into industry to build an ambitious welfare state , to the point now where the borrowed money supports it . Other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from taxes on the profits of their expanded industries and the wages of their highly paid workers . Part of the reason Britain went une way while much of the world went another seems to be the archaic British creature known as the class system , one that no one has gotten mad enough at to overthrow . " Britain is a country that never had a revolution , and I think it shows , " said William Pfaff , one of a Hudson Institute team that two years ago produced a widely circulated report on the condition of Britain . " It 's the whole tangled issue of privilege and class and who does what , " Mr. Pfaff said . " So many habits of mind and outlook are mired in the medieval and agrarian habits of preindustrial society . " A top government economist believes that such old divisions have been largely erased by 30 years of socialism . But foreign critics suspect that economic equality has little to do with social equality and that Britain still runs on a labyrinth of rules and rules within rules that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomsbury section of London carries not a single bolt of brown suit cloth . Why ? " Because , " he said , " one does n't wear brown suits . " The British classify and stratify themselves in their schools , their clubs , their pubs , their sports , where they live , how they eat , what they eat . Brown sauce , a mildly spicy dressing that comes in a ketchuplike bottle , is strictly working class . No Business for the Gentry Accents put people in their places probably more than anything else , but the right accent wo n't do without the right vocabulary . A working-class meal at noon is " dinner " ; for the upper classes , it is " lunch . " Such distinctions operate throughout the economy . Many of Britain 's brightest young men and women go to Oxford and Cambridge and from there into teaching , the civil service , the foreign office , science , journalism and finance -- but rarely into manufacturing or sales . " Trade is n't something a gentleman does , " Mr. Pfaff said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahara , " said a help-wanted ad in The Times of London . " So are real salesmen in London . I despair . For a real opportunity , ring me . " " It 's a matter of the dirty class and the clean class , " said Prof. Ralf Dahrendarf , head of the London School of Economics . " This is the oldest class division the world has known . " Professor Dahrendorf is a German , a prominent sociologist and a former Cornmon Market commissioner . The class system , he said , is related to still another barrier to economic growth . " The British , " he said , " like to feel they 're in boxes . They like to feel they 're located somewhere , rather than on avenues or roads . If that 's the way you are , I suppose you 're not really motivated . " " There 's a difference in values here , " he said , " There are countries based on the assumption that individual effort can get someone somewhere . Here it is thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective action . " " The British people , " he added , " are quite happy about belonging to groups , quite happy about not competing with other individuals . In America , unhappiness about the rat race is part of people 's happiness . " Britain , in that view , is a nation of warring armies of contented soldiers . The war they fight is called " we-they . " It is a conflict that poisons reasoned discourse between management and workers , between white Britons and Asian immigrants , between Scots and the English , between the ruling Labor Government and the Conservatives , and even between the left wing of the Labor Party and the faction of the party that governs . We-they , in political terms , means that each new government will try to undo the work of its predecessor . A Labor Government nationalized the steel industry . A Conservative Government denationalized it and a new Labor Government renationalized it . The principal loser in the merry-go-round was the steel industry . How a Conflict Mushrooms In industry , we-they means that petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally to wildcat strikes before the two sides finally sit down to talk . The process is endemic in the crucial steel and automobile industries . Over the last six months , nevertheless , the number of strikes has fallen to the lowest level in more than 20 years . It could be that attitudes are changing . Over that period , several important , normally strike-prone unions have voted out militant leaders and replaced them with moderates . It could also be just a spell of momentary caution . Britain is strugrfling out of its worst recession since World War II and unemployment is nearly 6 percent . Workers who might normally walk out , knowing they can get other jobs , are less secure today . Most of criticism of we-they industrial relations has been leveled at workers , but management may be even more at fault . " The widespread view is it 's the bloody minded British working man that causes this , " said Mr. Pfaff . " That 's not so . What 's wrong in Britain is more what 's wrong at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been served very well by their elite . " " The worker sees a problem , " said Pamela Taylor , a regional officer of a leading clerical union . " He wants to help . But he ca n't accept laissez-faire . Capitalism run rife would exploit him . " The Best-Paid Are Bitter Britain 's many years of lethargic growth has probably aggravated conflicts among groups . Like most European countries , Britain resorted to increasingly progressive tax systems to redistribute incomes . In most of those countries , the economies grew enough to assure that even if the rich man 's slice of the pie was thinner , he still got a lot of pie . Here , the pie barely grew , so the bestpaid Britons are bitter . Redistribution of incomes has now reached a point where the differentials among all workers are so small that there is little incentive to move from one job to another . " There is reason to think that the tax system is now a disincentive , " said the government economist . " Even the trade unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we reward skill , responsibility , and distasteful or dangerous work . " Despite the we-they conflicts , the stopgo governments , and the class system , many people like it here . " I have a feeling that this island is uninhabitable , " Professor Dahrendorf said , " and therefore , people have tried to make it habitable by being reasonable to one another . " He said he had taken an SO percent pay cut in leaving Brussels and does not want any more . " Most Germans , " he said , " dream of being Italian or British because those are the countries where they feel happy . "
