An offscene drum sounds a long roll , signifying the hour has come for the play to begin . The roll is thunderingly repeated and added to by a display of drum technique lasting some twenty seconds . The house lights go down and out . The theatre music ( organ ) strikes up strongly in the merry tune of " When the King Enjoys His Own Again . " Our Chorus , consisting of some twenty or twenty-five of our best singer-actors , enters quickly from the right and left and assembles on the main stage for the overture . The members are dressed in ordinary eighteenth century costumes in the main , with a few in aristocratic dress showing here and there , and several young people carry large flags  --  of the United States , England , Scotland , Ireland , Wales , Spain , South Carolina , and Georgia . These flags are used to good effect in this overture . As the overture is sung , the singers show in their body actions and reactions and the use of the flags something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing . All movements are choreographed . The organ modulates quickly into the first number and the voices burst into four-part harmony . CHORUS ( Accompanied and with faces alight and joyous , all words clearly enunciated . ) Joyful , joyful , we adore thee , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God of glory , God of love , Hearts unfold like flowers before thee , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Opening to the sun above . Melt the clouds of sin and sadness , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drive the dark of doubt away , Giver of immortal gladness , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fill us with the light of day . ( The organ moves into the next selection bit , the happy old English favorite , " Come , Lasses and Lads , " and with appropriate movement and singer response as noted. ) p. 3 Come , lasses and lads , take leave of your dads , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And away to the maypole his , For ev'ry he has got him a she &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the fiddler is standing by.For Willy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his Joan To jig it , jig it , jig it , jig it , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jig it up and down  --  To jig it , jig it , jig it , jig it , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jig it up and down . ( The music moves into the next selection , and the mood and response of the singers change to fit the song . A girls ' quintet is emphasized in this number . ) My lodging it is on the cold ground , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And oh ! very hard is my fare , But that which troubles me most is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unkindness of my dear.Yet still I cry " O turn , love , " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And " prithee , love , turn to me , For thou art the man I long for  --  ( The young girls express their longing in pantomime and the men respond or not . ) And alack ! what remedy ?

( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly exits right and left as it had entered . PETER TRUEMAN emerges from the CHORUS on the last two lines and comes downstage toward the audience , singing as he comes . He is dressed in good clean workman 's clothes and is cheerful and sprightly enough in his face and bearing . He is about forty years old . ) PETER ( Ending his song . ) My name is Peter Trueman in this play . And let me tell you there be some that are not true men  --  them that shut me and other unlucky souls behind the bars of debtors ' prison here in this vile London town . Times are hard in England now  --  money scarce , jobs few . And the English law says if you ca n't pay a debt , your body can be seized and shut away . ' T is the big men of England have brought this condition on us  --  gambling in the South Sea stock , and the bubble busted in their faces  --  and so  --  ( He gestures disgustedly with open palm ) his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to ease these conditions of poverty and unemployment .

( He kisses his fingers at the earth. ) p. 7 Aye , and there is much hope that he will yet have his settlement in the New World where crowds of us can go to start new lives afresh . Good people have already been choosed out for a first colony , both the high and the low , and I am praying the King will let us go . ( The organ sounds a prompting note . He takes off his hat and looks out over the audience . ) Now for our play . We are come together to tell a story  --  the story of the founding of Georgia . And I know plenty about it , for I was with master Oglethorpe through it all . And there 's history here  --  uhm  --  uhm . This whole region of the Golden Isles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history  --  in the perished laughter and salt of human tears , most of it forgot , forgot . ( Now impressively , almost sternly . ) But for tonight  --  let us remember , remember ! ( The organ makes a comment and dies . PETER moves a bit closer to the audience . ) Our play opens in London in the year 1732 . A charter has been drawn up for the Colony project and presented to the King . But he has not yet signed it . Now that England and Spain have made a treaty of peace for awhile maybe he will . It is June ninth and a few people important to our story are on their way for a meeting with his Majesty . ( The music begins softly playing " God Save the King . " He gestures toward the right side area . JONAS HAMPTON and his daughter REBECCA enter there . HAMPTON is a large imposing leonine man of 50 or so , and REBECCA an attractive brunette of 21 or 22 . Both are fashionably dressed , and HAMPTON carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other . PETER calls out announcingly. ) p. 8 Jonas Hampton , South Carolina planter , merchant , councilman and his Majesty 's most loyal servant  --  with his charming daughter Rebecca ! ( They both stop still . HAMPTON bows and REBECCA makes a curtsy to the audience . Then they move on . Entering at the upper right come JAMES OGLETHORPE and his aide ENSIGN WILLIAM HORTON . OGLETHORPE is 36 or 37 , above medium height , dark-haired , of frank open face and trim athletic figure . He carries a rolled map under his arm . HORTON is taller and also athletic . His hair is somewhat red . They also are most fashionably dressed . PETER again speaks announcingly . ) His Excellency , James Edward Oglethorpe  --  and his military aide  --  Ensign William Horton ! ( OGLETHORPE and HORTON stop , and each makes a bow to the audience as his name is called . They move on . The offscene organ continues playing " God Save the King . " The four people meet on the center stage , making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HORTON taking REBECCA 's hand and bowing over it . The group moves on to the left as the music plays , HORTON paying court to REBECCA as they go . PETER gazes after them . The music softens down . ) These four people will have much to do with one another in this play  --  some of it good , some of it not good . And you can see for yourself that Master Horton is already mightily taken with Mistress Rebecca Hampton . They met for the first time last night at the Earl of Egmont 's masked ball and danced together , and since then she has been like a ferment in his blood . ( Offscene at the left rear a snare drum is heard for an instant . PETER gestures in that direction . The unseen CHORUS there sounds forth in a rich four-part harmony . PETER joins in. ) p. 9 CHORUS AND PETER ( Accompanied . ) God save Great George the king , Long live our noble king , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save the king ! ( The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience room in the King 's palace in London . Two masking pieces have slid apart revealing a redcarpeted dais with a blue throne-like chair set on it . An overhanging gold canopy serves as a colorful background for the chair . A few members of the King 's court are gathered there , all dressed in the fashion of the times and as becomes the occasion . Among these is LORD PERCIVAL EGMONT , head of the Colony Trustees . Two tall GRENADIERS in red uniforms and dark plumes , their pennoned halberds held stiffly upright , are standing somewhat behind and on either side of the king 's chair . The song has gone on . ) Send him victorious , Happy and glorious , Long to reign over us , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save the King .

( The KING , accompanied by SIR ROBERT WALPOLE and a MAJOR-DOMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fifty years old , and a man of somewhat indulgent nature and manner . He lifts his hand in greeting , and the proper courtesy to their monarch is given by all , including PETER who is outside the scene . The KING seats himself and gestures to the MAJOR-DOMO that he is ready for business . The music and the song end . The MAJOR-DOMO bawls out  --  his words making no sound as they are swallowed up in the roll of the drum . ) MAJOR-DOMO From his Majesty 's colony in South Carolina  --  councilman , merchant , plantation owner , his Majesty 's most loyal servant  --  Jonas Hampton  --  ( After a pause. )  --  and his daughter Mistress Rebecca Hampton . ( HAMPTON and REBECCA enter . The drum roll ends . A murmur rises from some of the men at REBECCA 's beauty . The corpulent WALPOLE especially shows his admiration , and GEORGE himself is pleased with her . THE MAJOR-DOMO leads HAMPTON and REBECCA forward. ) p. 11 KING Welcome to London , Councilor Hampton . ( HAMPTON bends low over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( REBECCA comes forward and kneels . ) KING ( Gesturing her to rise . ) Nay , my child ! ( He extends his hand for her to kiss . She does so and rises all fluttery with excitement and steps back , her fan going . ) MAJOR-DOMO ( Bawling out again  --  soundlessly as the drum roll eats up his words . ) His Excellency James Edward Oglethorpe , Member of Parliament , and his aide Ensign William Horton ! ( OGLETHORPE and HORTON enter . ) KING ( Reaching out his hand in welcome . ) Greetings , Master Oglethorpe . ( To HORTON as OGLETHORPE bends over the KING 's hand . ) And greetings to you , sir . OGLETHORPE Your Majesty . HORTON ( Bowing low . ) Greetings , your Majesty . KING ( Gesturing toward HAMPTON . ) You gentlemen are known to one another ? ( OGLETHORPE and HAMPTON nod " yes " and bow to each other . The KING nods to HAMPTON . ) We would hear from you , sir . Attend , Master Oglethorpe. p. 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Governor Johnson and his Council of State  --  attesting once more the devotion of the South Carolina province to thee and to the Crown and glory of England . The colony is most flourishing , my Lord  --  with rice , indigo , corn , tobacco , some silk industry , and much trade with the Indians . We now have some six thousand white population and some thirty thousand Negro slaves . KING ( Touching his hands together . ) Excellent , most excellent , Councilor . HAMPTON And we still have hopes for our silk industry . Thousands of mulberry trees have been planted for the worms . ( HAMPTON unwraps the volume he carries . ) Herewith , your Majesty , a special book of greetings for your Natal Day , bound in native silk and inscribed therein by the Governor , your humble servant , other members of the Council , the leading planters , merchants , legislative members , leading citizens , from Charleston , Beaufort , St. Helena and elsewhere in Carolina  --  and with a full report of Colony affairs added . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the KING who takes it and thumbs the leaves rapidly , then hands it to a courtier . ) KING Again my thanks , most loyal Councilor . ( To OGLETHORPE and HAMPTON , somewhat business-like now . ) Gentlemen , I have summoned you to meet together here in my presence that we may better understand certain matters of import to the crown . Proceed , Master Oglethorpe. p. 13 OGLETHORPE After much effort on the part of many citizens , your Majesty , this recent act of Parliament has freed many hundreds , yea , thousands of people from debtors ' prison . But this humane act has also filled our streets with idle souls . They cry for work and there is no work . KING ( Somewhat abruptly . ) ' T is well known to us . OGLETHORPE ( A bit persistently . ) Their unhappy condition , your Grace , demands relief . The Trustees of our enterprise request once more that your gracious Majesty at the earliest date sign the charter establishing this new colony .

The Creek Indians live in that vast region , your Majesty . They count the land as their own . I have already begun negotiations with them bespeaking our hopes and wishes . KING Hopes and wishes ? ( Somewhat sternly . ) In 1665 , nearly a hundred years ago , the Creek chieftains made a treaty giving our Lords Proprietors the right to settlement even down below the St. Johns . Sir , you need no new treaty . OGLETHORPE But we trust , your Grace , that by making a new and special treaty of friendship we will the more win them to our cause . ( Hurrying on . ) Thus will the Colony the more likely thrive in peace . p. 14 EGMONT The Trustees so agree , your Majesty . KING ( To HAMPTON mainly . ) Master Oglethorpe has been a military man in the past but now he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . ( He now looks at HAMPTON and OGELETHORPE remove the map . ) What think you , sir ? HAMPTON We would feel the more protected with a settlement lying between us and the Spaniards  --  ( With a laugh. )  --  however weak it might be . KING Weak ? HAMPTON I have heard the terms on which Master Oglethorpe 's colony would be planted . I fear they are unreal . He does not allow slavery . OGLETHORPE ( Firmly . ) This is to be a colony where honest labor is a matter of common pride , sir , and with no dependence on the toil of another for one 's own subsistence . ( Always ready to get loose on his absorbing dream . ) This is to be a colony of people who will earn their way , and the hand of brotherhood will be reached to all of whatever color or creed or race who join us there . ( The KING applauds a bit satirically . ) HAMPTON ( Bowing to the KING . ) Your Grace , may I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina a success over the years . I am the largest slave owner in that colony . Truly I am not ashamed to say my ships import slaves . ( Somewhat argumentatively and earnestly . ) And why not bring these black people to this land . We need them and they need us . ( OGLETHORPE looks at him . ) In Africa many of them are cannibals , souls lost in darkness . Here in the new land they learn the blessed faith of Jesus Christ and have a chance at salvation . We give them clothes , good food , houses , care well for them . ( WALPOLE applauds. ) p. 15 WALPOLE We commend you , sir . ( THE KING nods again . REBECCA looks her admiration at her father . ) HAMPTON ( To OGLETHORPE . ) For all of your purposes for peace , I hope you will have sufficient soldiers and guns to make some protection for your people . I speak from experience as an officer in the Carolina militia , sir . KING Surely so . Spain could not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  defense , not offense . ( OGLETHORPE nods . ) This all sits well to my heart . ( He reaches both hands toward OGLETHORPE and HAMPTON . He takes their hands and puts them together . ) And so we affirm our agreement . OGLETHORPE AND HAMPTON ( Strongly . ) We do . ( During this scene HORTON and REBECCA have moved to the background , and now and then HORTON is seen paying special and warm attention to the Carolina girl , but she for the most part stares ahead of her or keeps her eyes fastened on her father . The KING gestures to SIR ROBERT WALPOLE who reads the document he holds in a great rolling voice and with some touch of irony in his manner of reading . ) WALPOLE Whereas many of his Majesty 's subjects who through no fault of their own but through ill-luck have been reduced to great necessities in these special times and desire to settle beyond the seas where they may gain not only a comfortable subsistence for themselves but will increase our trade and commerce and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , I , George the Second , King of England , do designate the land lying south of the Savannah River and hereinafter described , to be the new province for settlement , and I do hereby declare , appoint and confirm the Honorable James Edward Oglethorpe , his Majesty 's most loyal servant , Governor and leader of the same , and the new colony henceforth shall be named in mine own honor  --  Georgia ! ( The PEOPLE applaud and the music sounds a flourish and continues in the background as the KING , assisted by SIR ROBERT , goes through the pantomime of signing the document and stamping it . The music stops. ) p. 16 OGLETHORPE ( Fervently . ) Our heartfelt thanks , your Majesty ! Our thanks  --  thanks ! ( He bows again before the KING , then turns in his enthusiasm to HORTON and shakes his hand . He also shakes REBECCA 's hand somewhat to her amusement , and turns and embraces LORD EGMONT . PETER from his position outside the scene twirls his hat and calls out gleefully as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King George ! KING And so , Governor Oglethorpe , my Lord Egmont , you may at once begin sending your people to Georgia . ( He moves on . The organ starts up again in " God Save the King . " THE PEOPLE in the scene wait with bowed heads as the MONARCH and his close associates make their exit . The light fades out and lingers a bit over at the side-stage area in an eye-blink scene . SIR ROBERT WALPOLE and LORD EGMONT come along there on their way home from the king 's audience . LORD EGMONT touches SIR ROBERT on the arm . ) EGMONT What think ye of our plans for Oglethorpe 's colony , Sir Robert ? I presume you are opposed to it . WALPOLE Since it is approved by the King I am not supposed to say . ( After a pause . ) But as a free and individual Englishman I will . It stinketh . Its logic is rotten and the forgetting of history appalling . Mark ye , sir , you Trustees agree to support these people each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tools , arms . Do you not ? p. 17 EGMONT Till they get on their feet and are able to support themselves on their own fifty-acre plots of land . The self-supporting freeholders , like Ensign Horton with his servants , get five hundred acres . This is another unique feature of our project that sets it apart from the other twelve colonies . WALPOLE One year , you say ? Then they 'll want two years and three to get on their feet . And why not , since their welfare is paid for by you Trustees . That , sir , is human nature . ( Roughly . ) And this talk of peace is child 's prattle . War between England and Spain lies in the nature of the two countries . The one is Protestant , Anglo-Saxon and with a heritage of freedom . The other is Catholic , latin and subservient to monarchy . Their very souls are in opposition . EGMONT But sir , the treaty of peace affirms  --  WALPOLE ( Hurrying on . ) Let but some irritating incident occur  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an injury to some sailor  --  a finger or ear  --  and once more the shooting will start . Oglethorpe 's poor people there in the wilds of Georgia will be the first to be massacred by the rush of Spanish soldiers up from Havana and St. Augustine . Therefore the venture stinketh and he will fail . Good night , my Lord . p. 18 EGMONT We do not agree ! Good night , Sir Robert . ( They go their separate ways . The scene fades out . In the darkness a ship 's bell is heard in its measured ringing . This continues for a moment , and then an enclosure of light appears just above the right tormentor . The bell dies. ) p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 Aboard the good Ship Ann at sea . PETER is revealed standing on the poop deck of the ship . Actually he is standing on a little platform built just below the top of the right tormentor . He is bareheaded and carries a bundle tucked under his arm . PETER After many delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ship Ann  --  ( He indicates. )  --  November 17 , 1732 . And we sailed and we sailed ever westward  --  through November and on into December . At times we would be becalmed and we would sit on the water like a dozing duck . At such times Governor Oglethorpe or Lieutenant Horton would have us out on deck doing our physical exercises  --  men , women and children . ( He illustrates with spraddling legs and flung-out arms , holding onto his bundle and counting the while , puffing and blowing . ) One  --  two  --  three  --  four . One  --  two  --  ( The light comes up at the rear and we have an eye-blink scene of the passengers on the ship 's deck doing the same exercise , HORTON in charge and OGLETHORPE exercising likewise . This lasts for some fifteen seconds and fades out as PETER goes on . ) We must keep strong for the work ahead , he said . Your body is sacred . Take care of it .

The moans and prayers to heaven sound forth as the wind howls and the waters beat and tear against our plunging ship . ( Shivering . ) Ugh ! ( He shakes out his bundle into a sort of storm poncho with a wide-brimmed water-shedding old hat to go with it . Looking about at the threatening storm , he puts them on . In the sound track the hollow booming of the waves against the ship is heard , accompanied by the now whistling , screaming wind . Cries and broken bits of prayers come from the unseen terrified passengers in the darkness at the center rear ) p. 20 VOICES ( Mainly women . ) Mercy , Lord Jesus ! Save us ! We shall all be drowned . Mercy ! Mercy ! OTHER VOICES Oh , why did we leave England ! Oh ! Oh ! ( Children are heard wailing .

As the ship dips and rises so does he to keep his balance , and the lantern moves likewise . A murky foggy illumination comes up at the rear of the center stage , revealing the now-crowded bedraggled people , some are kneeling , some half-bent over against the storm , and a few are standing as if defiantly against all threats . A length of hawser runs in front of them to which some are clinging . Like PETER these suffering ones bend and shift and sway in a choreographed motion with the motion of the struggling ship . We see OGLETHORPE among the people comforting them . The wind and wave and voice effects blast in once more with increased fury for an instant and retire . PETER keeps the motion of his body going to fit in with the erratic motion of the ship .

( The song roars on in rich and tumultuous four-part harmony , building in power until it seems to engulf the whole amphitheatre . The motion of PETER 's body and of the others slows toward rest , the lantern the same . ) We 'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High as the heavens our voices raise , And earth with her ten thousand tongues &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise .

OTHER VOICES We are saved ! ( The organ gives a few triumphant chords , and the ship scene fades out . The light comes on in a spot at the right front of the center stage . PETER appears there . He is bareheaded and carrying his bundle as before . ) PETER We finally touched harbor at Charleston , South Carolina , on January thirteen , seventeen-thirty-three  --  after a voyage of nearly two months  --  all in good health , thanks be  --  ( From ancient habit he lifts his eyes to heaven , then with a sharp wave of his hand cancels the old thought . ) Governor Oglethorpe paid a short visit ashore and signed certain treaty matters between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow , Mary Musgrove , for the first time  --  she who was to play such a part in the life of our colony .

The next day we sailed southward toward the Savannah River . We went up the river some miles to the Yamacraw Indian village where Mary Musgrove had arranged a meeting with the Chief Tomochichi there on the high bluffs . ( He gestures toward the center stage . The light fades from him . An Indian drum begins beating in the darkness at the left center of the main stage . The light comes up on the main stage. ) p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 At Tomochichi 's village .

An Indian procession comes in at the left front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a young Indian boy . MARY MUSGROVE is leading the way in . She is a half-breed according to history , a daughter of an Indian princess and a white trader . She is of medium height , of graceful figure and dressed in a red dress with dark trimmings . Her rich bluish-black hair hangs down her back in two long braids , and across her forehead is a chaplet of white beads . Her complexion is light brown and her great eyes are dark and liquid as a doe 's . She is a striking person and is of youthful but indeterminate age . Behind her comes the imposing figure of the old Creek chief TOMOCHICHI . He has a spray of white and black feathers in his hair , heavy amulets hanging from his ears , and his face is marked with chalk-white streakings connoting peace . His tall rawbony form is wrapped in a black buffalo robe with white feather lacings .

Behind these come three or four chiefs in their various dress and following these a number of Indians , including several youths and maidens . Lifted above these are the colorful totems of Creek Indian life and custom  --  carried along much as the English carry their lifted flags or family escutcheons . These totems are examples of good Indian folk art  --  the head of a buffalo , or a bear , a lengthened fish , a snarling wildcat , a huge twining snake or what not . MARY lifts her hand . The cortege stops . SCENAUKY brings forward a folded white robe and she and MARY spread it on the ground . TOMOCHICHI comes forward and kneels on the robe . His followers stand motionless behind him . The Indian drum is suddenly silent . An English drum is heard at the right rear . As it continues to beat , OGLETHORPE , HORTON and several other colonists appear there , their DRUMMER BOY with them . The British flag , raised high , moves along and with it the banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This cortege stops as it nears the front . OGLETHORPE lifts his hand in greeting to CHIEF TOMOCHICHI . But the CHIEF who is kneeling with bowed head does not see him . MARY hurries forward to OGLETHORPE . The drum stops . OGLETHORPE bows . OGLETHORPE Greetings once more , Mrs. Musgrove , and all thanks for this gathering . p. 24 MARY ( With some bit of accent . ) Our thanks for your coming . This is well . ( She leads OGLETHORPE over to TOMOCHICHI . ) Our noble chief , Tomochichi , your Excellency . He is praying to Yohewa for his blessing . ( TOMOCHICHI looks up . OGLETHORPE reaches out his hand but the CHIEF does not take it . ) He is loved by his people ! OGLETHORPE My people are honored , O Chief , in your presence . We come to you in peace . ( MARY translates and as she does so the little Indian drum sets up its clatter and absorbs her words . She turns to OGLETHORPE . ) MARY Our Mico has heard of you much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I tell him you must be so  --  good . ( She turns and speaks volubly to the CHIEF , and the drum once more eats up her words . Then she turns back to OGLETHORPE , the drum falling silent as before . She gives a gay and girlish laugh . ) I tell our Mico  --  remember from my mother to read the face . In Charleston I saw deep there into your eyes  --  I saw a good man . ( The CHIEF , who can understand a bit of English , reaches up and pulls OGLETHORPE down to kneel on the robe . He puts his face closer to OGLETHORPE and looks deep into his eyes . Then he lowers his head as before . OGLETHORPE lowers his head likewise . And the two figures remain in this attitude for a moment . MARY gestures and UMPICHI , the BELOVED ONE , bursts out of the shadows at the left . He is an ancient spindle-legged fellow in a white feather jacket and a brown bearskin skirt . His face is covered by a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's white topknot above . He carries a small bunch of feathers in his hand , the white ones in his right , and black ones in his left . As the Indian drum beats , he dances around the kneeling figures , stroking their shoulders and faces with the feathers and in his pantomime invoking down from Yohewa in heaven blessings on these two leaders . This goes on , say , for thirty seconds . HORTON gestures to the English DRUMMER to do his part . The boy steps over and stands with the INDIAN BOY , and the two carry on together . Then they start marching around the three figures , led by the INDIAN BOY . Suddenly TOMOCHICHI springs to his feet . OGLETHORPE rises also . The drums stop and the COLONIST BOY returns to his place by HORTON , grinning with pride. ) p. 25 MARY ( To OGLETHORPE as she watches the CHIEF 's face . ) Our people have suffered much from the white men  --  there across the river . But already I tell him you now would be governor here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OGLETHORPE Yes , help your people , and you help us . Together as friends , brothers , we would be stronger  --  both . ( Now directly to TOMOCHICHI in his earnestness as if the old man could understand him fully . ) No more rum , no stealing from your people  --  your buckskins and furs bring fair prices . I say it must be so . Me , the Governor  --  and the treaty signed with Governor Johnson  --  it says so . ( He pulls a document from his pocket and thumps it . ) See , Mary ! Here it says so  --  Carolina agrees so  --  ( As TOMOCHICHI stares at him with impassive face . ) O great Chief , we wish to make treaty with you  --  asking you to grant us land for our homes , homes for us , your brothers . You will help us and we help you . You will teach us the ways of the wilderness , of this new and happy land . You will teach us the wisdom of the new sky , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish and the animals therein . And , O great Chief , we will give you of our knowledge  --  of our strength  --  much arms and tools and clothing , and we will help you in making strong warm houses and  --  ( He reaches his hand out again . TOMOCHICHI stares off . OGLETHORPE drops his hand . MARY translates , the drum accompanying as before . The CHIEF 's face is still impassive. ) p. 26 TOMOCHICHI ( Suddenly . ) Mosa ki to weemi ? Ood rees lomi tee ? MARY ( To OGLETHORPE . ) Much land do you wish ? Where ? ( HORTON is standing nearby . OGLETHORPE reaches for his sword , takes it and draws a map on the ground . The CHIEFS flock around , some of them get down on all-fours to peer at the marking . HORTON , CAUSTON , COOKE and some of the others come closer too . HILLISPILLI stands guardingly between these latter and his people . ) OGLETHORPE ( As he marks . ) This the Savannah River  --  here  --  below  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod , understanding enough to follow somewhat . ) Here  --  here  --  good land  --  let us live here . You say how much  --  ( TOMOCHICHI turns away . The CHIEFS and the others stand up and for an instant put their heads together , OGLETHORPE stands waiting . MARY calls out as if to prompt a decision . ) MARY Umpichi . ( THE BELOVED ONE fetches in a buffalo robe . She holds it up for TOMOCHICHI to take . He puts out his hand to refuse it . ) TOMOCHICHI Ni ! ( No ) ( But his " no " is not too loud and strong . MARY lifts the robe invitingly toward him but he does n't take it . She then holds it against her. ) p. 27 MARY Eeti , Mico ! Eeti ! ( Yes , great chief , yes . ) ( TOMOCHICHI moves several paces from OGLETHORPE and stands pondering matters . Again he lifts his face toward the sky . All watch him . The little drum starts up its low whirr of sticks . MARY takes things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instantly back with several young Indians , girls and boys , following her . UMPICHI and she lead them into a dance , circling around OGLETHORPE , paying him honor , the drum pouring out its percussion of accompaniment the while . Running in from the right now comes a group of young colonists prompted along by HORTON . They start a dance of adulation around TOMOCHICHI . He is instantly pleased . The colonist DRUMMER steps over and beats his accompaniment for this action . The two groups and the two drums continue . The onlookers both Indian and white soon show in their shuffling jostling motion something of the impulse and inspiration they are receiving from the activity . The light emphasizes the two leaders and their circling dancers . The offscene organ now comes in with a crash of dissonant chords , then smoothes itself out into a gay dance tune , " The Crocodile , " the while a heavy drumbeat continues in the pedal . As if this were a signal , the two groups by a clever opening in their ranks sweep TOMOCHICHI toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner circle of Indian dancers , with an outer circle of colonist dancers forming quickly and enclosing them . The circles move in opposite directions , the one inside the other , and as the two drums continue to beat , the offscene organ plays away . At a signal in the organ the two groups by a dexterous movement merge into one large circle enclosing the two leaders . The dancers are now so arranged that an English lad has an Indian girl on his right and an Indian lad an English girl on his right . As this dance builds in intensity , the effect on the onlookers increases . Finally we see the two bodies of people beginning to merge into a sort of friendship pantomime in the background . The flagbearers swap with the totem carriers , etc . NOTE : the dance director can use his own imagination of course in working up this dance . These notes are suggestions for his use . The big circle of dancers now holding hands swoops forward toward the center and moves OGLETHORPE and TOMOCHICHI closer together , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads held high . Each time the dancers sweep squeezingly toward the center , the music in the organ makes its accompanying surge and so does the volume of the drumbeats . The dancers and the two leaders are now in one big convulsive grouping close together . TOMOCHICHI has more and more responded to the meaning of the dance . He takes OGLETHORPE 's right hand finally and lifts it high above the tight mass of bodies in a handclasp of friendship as the dancers surge once more tightly around them . The flags and totems are lifted higher than ever . The drums thunder and the organ roars. ) p. 28 COLONISTS AND INDIANS ( Simultaneously . ) ' Ray ! ' Ray ! Ya-oh ! Ya-oh ! ( The light now has intensified the center of the scene . The dancers wing back as the scene grows silent . TOMOCHICHI reaches toward MARY , and she brings the buffalo robe forward and hands it to him . As he puts it around OGLETHORPE 's shoulders , MARY speaks for him . ) MARY Here is a buffalo robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle is swift , and the buffalo strong . We know the great English are swift as the eagle and strong as the buffalo . The feathers are soft and mean kindness and love . The buffalo skin means protection . Since you are swift and strong be kind to my people and help us . ( He drapes the robe around OGLETHORPE . The people applaud . OGLETHORPE gestures behind him and HORTON comes forward with his gift  --  a large golden chain and pendulant golden medal . ) OGLETHORPE This chain and medal are of gold , signifying the truth and honesty of the friendship we offer you , O great Chief . TOMOCHICHI ( In his huge voice . ) Twani kee noti  --  molo tee  --  molo tee ! MARY ( To OGLETHORPE . ) His heart is moved at this gift and his eyes fill with the hot tears of thankfulness . p. 29 OGLETHORPE ( Reading loudly . ) " To the good Mico Tomochichi , Chief of the Yamacraw Indians  --  in friendship from  --  " ( Somewhat impressively . ) " His Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , King of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith . " ( He places the chain about the CHIEF 's neck . MARY translates to the CHIEF and those around him , the drum going the while . The colonists applaud and the Indians give a great shout as OGLETHORPE now embraces TOMOCHICHI . ) INDIANS Yah-oh ! Yah-oh ! ( The scene fades out and the drums and organ die . PETER appears in a spotlight as before . ) PETER After a feast , a treaty was signed and of their vast holdings from the mountains to the sea , the Indians deeded us  --  ( He holds up an invisible document and reads loudly . ) The Creek Nations do freely and formally give , convey and bequeath to the Georgia Colony for their dwelling place that territory lying south of the Savannah River and down to the Altamaha River , including the Islands at the mouth of the said river and thence westward up these rivers as far as the tide doth run . ( Rolling up the document . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks on this document  --  saying the covenant was to last till the rivers ran dry and the mountains fell down into the sea . ( He puts the document inside his coat . ) And now the business of making our homes in the wilderness begins . Here stand the great forests . Here stands man sizing them up . And the contest is on . Work , work , cutting and clearing ! Make way  --  make ready  --  the warm earth waiting there  --  younder before us the fat harvest awaiting !  --  ( He gestures toward the rear ) p. 30 p. 31 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 ( A Work Montage ) ( PETER spits on his hands , picks up his " axe " and pantomically goes after a huge tree with long measured swings . The offscene music begins the first labor song , " To God the Earth Doth Appertain , " softly at first and then with slowly increased power as the different work vignettes appear  --  all in pantomime and without props . In the darkness the silhouette pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light strikes in on the right rear of the center stage in a controlled flood and holds there for a moment or two . ) Vignette A ( A number of colonist men are seen swinging their axes in most manful pantomime , even if some of them awkwardly , as they start their monumental and backbreaking work . PETER , now that he has seen the work start , stands over in the shadow at the right ready to identify the actions . Now and then he participates in a bit of simulation . ) PETER Chop  --  chop  --  and let the sweat roll ! ( He wipes his forehead . A number of colonist women , a few youths and children come behind the men , pantomiming the picking up of the twigs and branches and carrying them to the rear with a dumping motion and returning . Others are dragging nearby tree-tops off to the rear . Two or three Indian girls are helping the colonist girls . The music has continued . ) And lacking ploughs at first , we must dig and spade up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard by yard . Push that shovel , swing that mattock down ! Hanh ! ( He does so . The spotlight now hits the left rear of the center stage in its tight circle but a little larger in diameter than before. ) p. 32 Vignette B ( Some eight or ten colonists are hard at work . Men in front are grubbing and spading the soil and behind them are a few women with hoes planting corn  --  this too all in pantomime . An Indian woman is showing them how . All is carried on in rhythm to the offscene music . One of the colonist women weakens and sinks down to her knees . Her husband turns , puts his hand on her forehead , finds she is feverish , bids her rest , and returns wearily to his work . The offscene CHORUS now begins the labor song . ) CHORUS To God the earth doth appertainThe world also is his domain &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all that therein dwelleth , For he hath founded it full fastAnd ' stablished it t'abide and last &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The singing softens down a bit . ) PETER And beams and great sills must now be hewn for our houses .

Nearby two colonist women are pestle-pounding corn in a mortar , an Indian woman helping . The sill is finished The men bend to raise it . One of them weakens . PETER calls out encouragingly . ) PETER Heave ho , ye men of Georgia ! ( He hurries over and pantomimes helping .

Through heat and rain and cold we carry onTo cease not till this blessed work be done . ( The men finally get the great sill upon their shoulders and start with it toward the center stage . The spotlight now moves from one work area to the other in a kaleidoscope pattern for a moment , and all the workers are seen carrying on their separate stations of work in the rhythm of the song . ) CHORUS ' T was in the merry month of May &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We landed here  --  To work , to work , the Governor said &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accents clear.With axe and adze and hoe , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hammer and the maul  --  Yea , swing them with a right good will &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let them fall !

The music and the motion of the people now begin a ritard as if weariness or sickness is overcoming them all .

( The organ modulates into a hymn , " O Lord in Thee . " ) And sickness and death started taking their toll . ( On the word " toll " the organ dies out and an offscene funeral drum begins its slow muffled beat . The people who a few moments before were busy " subduing " the wilderness now move choreographically toward the right front of the center stage , forming as they go a sort of funeral procession and moving off to the right . ) The first to die was our beloved Dr. William Cox . He had left a wide practice in England to come to Georgia and help Governor Oglethorpe in the work he too believed in . ( The spotlight now shrinks down and out , and a grayish shaft of illumination cuts across the main stage at the far rear from left to right .

OGLETHORPE , bareheaded and with down-pointing saber , walks just behind him . By his side is a boy with the funeral drum , muffled and slow-beaten . Next come six pallbearers carrying a wood-box coffin draped with a large British flag . A squad of armed redcoat soldiers under the command of HORTON follows , and behind them two men with the Georgia banner and British flag held respectfully forward . The workers now fall in behind the flags and the procession moves on . PETER and the midwife ELIZABETH HARRISON come laSt . ZEISBERGER begins the funeral hymn , and all join in. ) p. 35 PEOPLE ( Accompanied by the muffled slow drumbeat only . ) O Lord in thee is all my truSt . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give ear unto my woeful cry.Refuse me not that am unjust &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But , bowing down thy heav'nly eye , Behold how I do still lament &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My sin wherein I do offend.O Lord for them I shall be shent &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cortege turns now to cross diagonally toward the left center .

To thee , my God , e'en all day long &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I raise my piteous plea and call  --  O ease me of my woeful wrong &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cleanse my heart of bitter gall ! ( By this time the main body of the cortege has disappeared at the left center . The procession slows down and those at the rear stop and stand looking off toward the place of burial which is apparently only a few yards away . The singing and the drum stop .

Almost daily the funeral drum was sounding its muffled beat to the grave . But in spite of all difficulty and discouragement we labored on . We named our city Savannah after the beautiful river , and we began building our houses , the Governor 's firSt . But he gave it over to the sick Mrs. Martin and her ailing husband , and continued to sleep on the ground under his tent like us common sort . Aye , the people love him for sharing their hardships equally , and as for me , Peter Trueman , I 'm his man till the clocks of doomsday strike their final hour . ( He looks off . ) Ah , there comes the midwife Elizabeth Harrison , my wilful lady love . Ahm , why do I say " my " ? Yet I am still hopeful . ( ELIZABETH HARRISON enters along the left side area . PETER bows to her . ) Greetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . Now that we see her better than before , she shows to be a rather attractive person about Peter 's age , a bit plump and with apple-red cheeks . Her brown hair is hidden under her white nurse 's cap . ) ELIZABETH Here you are again , Peter Trueman , lazing and talking to yourself . PETER Nay , nay , I am giving the people out there  --  ( He indicates the theatre audience. )  --  a few facts of history to help them keep up with our story . ( ELIZABETH looks out toward the audience and curtsies. ) p. 37 ELIZABETH ( Back to PETER . ) I am in need of more wild cherry bark . Mistress Welch is sorely swollen with colic and must have her cordial . PETER She needs Indian purge root to work the devil out of her , that woman .

ELIZABETH ( Severely . ) And well you should crave pardon , Peter Trueman . Your hands were rough as an iron file against my tender flesh . PETER Calloused from honest labor in the fields and forests , my love . But I am eager romantic by nature  --  and would you were too . ELIZABETH ( Tossing her head . ) Midwifery makes not for romance . If you had pulled as many babies into the world as I have , you 'd not be so full of heat and passion . p. 38 PETER Now , honey lady , all love-making do n't have to be baby-making . There be much careful pleasure without it . ( He grabs her hand and this time succeeds in kissing it . He holds onto it . ) ELIZABETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter ! PETER I will anon , sweet lady . Let me finish first my words for the folks out there . ( He turns toward the audience , releasing her hand . ) In spite of rumors and weakness and death , other colonists have come to join us here in Georgia  --  the hard-working Lutherans who have built themselves a settlement at Ebenezer . And a body of Scotch have come  --  and have a community over there  --  ( He gestures. )  --  which they call New Inverness or Darien . ELIZABETH ( Decisively . ) And glad I am they are settled there  --  the Scotch . They stopped here in Savannah awhile in their men 's short kilt skirts and such a flaunting of knobby-knuckled knees and hairy red legs I never saw before ! PETER Uh-uh , ' Lizabeth .

PETER All people are welcome here , he said . And so they are . And most important to some is that Reverend John and Charles Wesley have arrived . ELIZABETH Sophy Hopkins and several young ladies are happy again . ( With a look at PETER . ) Feeling they are safer from sin now . PETER Uhm  --  uhm . ( Sourly . ) And preaching two times a day and three on Sundays ! ( He shakes his head . ) Remors keep reaching us of rising tempers between Spain and England . Governor Oglethorpe has been exploring amongst the islands farther south for a place to build a strong fort easy of defense and lay out a well-protected capital city .

Two flags on their tall staffs show in front of the house  --  Britain and Georgia . OGLETHORPE is seated at the table with a number of papers and a ledger in front of him . Three men are standing before him  --  THOMAS CAUSTON , WILLIAM COOKE and NOBLE JONES , bailiffs and members of the Governor 's council . CAUSTON is near middle age , the other two around thirty . OGLETHORPE goes on frankly and firmly . OGLETHORPE But we are winning this struggle , slowly  --  but winning . We must not weaken . You are in positions of authority  --  the people look to you . ( He slaps the table with his hand . ) CAUSTON ( Something of a phlegmatic fellow . ) They do more than look to us , your honor , they pursue me even to my bed at night . COOKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailiffs the same , your Excellency . JONES Following us  --  complaining , whining . CAUSTON ( Indicating the ledger . ) And among all our troubles  --  this . Study my entries and vouchers , sir , and you will see I have cause for complaint . The expense of this colony is already out of hand . You appointed me to my office as keeper of the stores here in Savannah , and I have done my best to balance accounts but can not . The people are evermore lining up at the door of the storehouse for more supplies , and many of them bearing a signed order from you . I have credited and credited and charged to the Trustees in London until I am in disgrace with that honorable body . ( Pulling a letter from his coat . ) Here , Lord Egmont blisters my hide . p. 42 OGLETHORPE ( Chuckling . ) He blisters mine first but I am now toughened to it . I will write again to the Trustees accepting all responsibility for these overdrafts . But , sir ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear in public . You dispirit all who see you . Brighten up , men , cease your tales of woe . COOKE ( Grimly . ) Your council has finally come to the conclusion , sir , that this colony will not succeed with its present methods . OGLETHORPE So have I heard before . JONES ( Gesturing . ) Just across the river there the people of South Carolina with their slaves are flourishing . More and more our colonists are asking that  --  OGLETHORPE ( Sternly . ) Slavery shall never be allowed in Georgia ! CAUSTON And day by day we go deeper into debt . After eighteen months hardly half of the people are self-sustaining . OGLETHORPE And ten months ago hardly a quarter were . Consider , gentlemen , what we have already accomplished  --  two thousand mulberry trees which we received from Carolina are set and  --  CAUSTON And the trees wither already  --  the leaves are burnt off them . And half the silkworms are dead . p. 43 OGLETHORPE ( Half-mockingly . ) Woe ! Woe ! It may prove that silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are  --  rice , perhaps cotton , tobacco , wheat . We 'll have to find out . Our corn is flourishing , and barley , rye and even indigo  --  and our vegetables . It takes time , man , time  --  and all the while our people are growing more hardened to this life  --  fewer and fewer dying . ( Resuming his statistics . ) We have sixty houses built here and are laying out a city all men some day will be proud of . We have two forts armed and manned and are planning others  --  Captain Horton is out even now surveying the islands . The Indians are our allies and bring us wild meat . Tomochichi is our friend . The Spaniards have n't yet molested us . Sir , we are still most fortunate . ( Indicating a letter . ) And from the Trustees a message that another ship with colonists will arrive in the spring . CAUSTON ( Slapping his head with his hand . ) Then how will I feed them ? OGLETHORPE They will bring a year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir , why our trade in hides from the Indians prospers not ? OGLETHORPE ( Slapping the table again . ) Because of the unprincipled traders from across the river . A solemn treaty was signed with the Carolina Province . It is being broken . I shall take steps . p. 44 CAUSTON ( Pointing . ) May I have my ledger , sir ? I will continue to add up our losses . ( OGLETHORPE hands him the ledger . CAUSTON turns away and then turns back . ) Your Excellency , since I am wrote down as a complainer , I will complain on one more item . In this , all the bailiffs agree with me . The house lots and the garden plots are all taken . With more settlers coming we need to be sparing with our city land . Colonel Bull is wasting it . You have named the main street after him and now in his pride he is setting aside great empty squares . ( COOKE and JONES nod their agreement . ) THE TWO Aye ! OGLETHORPE Not empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs and trees , as laid out by Robert Castell , a gifted friend of mine who died in debtors prison . In his memory we are making Savannah beautiful . And , Mr. Causton , in an old book I read  --  a thing that is beautiful is seldom wasteful . CAUSTON ( Doggedly . ) But , sir , the Council met and voted to a man on this matter of the city land . OGLETHORPE Then you met without my authority and the action has no warrant . COOKE We also voted that  --  ( Hesitating and then plunging on. )  --  that your methods are becoming rather high-handed , sir . p. 45 CAUSTON Dictatorial , sir . ( OGLETHORPE springs up , then controls himself and speaks quietly as he remains standing . ) OGLETHORPE We will discuss this matter freely and frankly at our next council meeting . Like the motto of our Georgia flag that stands outside that door there  --  non sibi sed aliis  --  we are all for one and one for all . We fail or succeed together . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , gentlemen . MEN ( Gruffly . ) Good night , your Excellency . ( They come outside . OGLETHORPE stares off a moment , then reseats himself and begins working at his papers . ) CAUSTON ( Half-disgustedly . ) Come along , men . The Governor will address the full council and with his eloquence win us to his side again . ( They move off , passing PETER as they go into the shadows . He is whistling his " bollem-tit " melody . He salutes the men and they give him nodding recognition . OGLETHORPE looks up from his work as PETER comes in front of the house . ) OGLETHORPE As usual , Peter  --  all seems to go well with you . PETER ( Saluting the house . ) Most excellent well , your honor . A certain lady hath furnished me with an item for working  --  and it promises much . And , by my faith , the promise of that promise promises to promise me much more . ( He gives his soaring laugh. ) p. 46 OGLETHORPE ( Smiling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a great comfort to this colony and to me , Peter . PETER ( Bowing . ) Thankee , Governor . ( He is still outside the house and stands looking about him . ) OGLETHORPE ( Still writing . ) Aye , a man loving this world , believing in it , eh , Peter ? PETER ( Chuckling . ) The old woman said I laughed out loud when three hours old , so pleased I was to be born into this happy world . ( He turns into the edge of the light . ) I hear young Charles Wesley is to do some of these heavy report writings for you , sir . Excellent good it is . OGLETHORPE A most capable secretary  --  a great hymn writer too . Tonight he is catechizing the children 's class . ( A VOICE calls softly from the darkness at the right . ) VOICE Peter ! PETER Ah , my sweet ' Lizabeth . God be with you , sir . OGLETHORPE Farewell , Peter . ( PETER scrambles away in the direction of the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and making notes , humming abstractedly to himself a bit of Peter 's song . MARY MUSGROVE comes up in front of the house and stops . OGLETHORPE feels her there and looks out . She goes up into the room. ) p. 47 MARY ( Smiling . ) You happy  --  you sing . OGLETHORPE An old habit I got in the wars on the continent . When a battle is  --  er  --  difficult , you sing . MARY Difficult  --  hard ? OGLETHORPE Then you put out more effort , and finally you win . Hmm  --  you often do . MARY And you are winning here in Georgia . You already have won the Indian people from here to the Cherokees in the mountains . Other white men , leaders , they have not trusted in the paSt . You they truSt . They call you father . OGLETHORPE ( Stroking his chin . ) My gray beard ! ( He laughs . ) And the treaty we have made with the great chiefs at Coweta Town is due mainly to you . If trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference . MARY ( Suddenly . ) I have this  --  you say " present "  --  for you . ( She hands him a little homemade booklet . He takes it with pleasure . ) A word book  --  Creek Indian words and English words . OGLETHORPE Now I can learn your language better  --  learn faSt . And you made it  --  you yourself ? ( MARY nods ) p. 48 MARY And sewed it together with the needle and thread you gave me . OGLETHORPE Bless you for this little book . You are very  --  very clever . Soon I can say more good words to my friend and father , the wise Tomochichi  --  ( Lightly. )  --  And to you . ( MARY smiles . ) Tell the great chief that once more I thank him for the fresh game he has just sent us and will visit him shortly . MARY He will be much pleased . ( She stands staring at OGLETHORPE with her great eyes . He studies the little book , somewhat embarrassed before her gaze . She shakes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time here , soon two years  --  and your wife far , far away . OGLETHORPE Wife ? MARY Mrs. Welch , she say today you have a wife in England  --  and you never tell me . OGLETHORPE Oh , that woman ! She has a great imagination for stories . No , I have no wife  --  There was a girl once . She died . ( Gazing off . ) A memory . MARY She is dead  --  but still in here ? ( She touches her heart . ) OGLETHORPE Yes , in here . p. 49 MARY ( Her face alight . ) Then let me be there in her place  --  me  --  Mary Musgrove  --  alive . ( OGLETHORPE is obviously more embarrassed and he picks up the map and begins folding it vigorously in his nervous hands . Something of a fight is going on in him . ) OGLETHORPE ( Turning and gazing down at her . ) John Matthews is one of our best rangers , Mary . He is Captain Horton 's right-hand man and he loves you . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you  --  ( She raises herself on tiptoe and gazes deep into his face. )  --  in your eyes I see  --  I see  --  me  --  me there . OGLETHORPE Then I better close them , Mary . ( He turns away . ) Good night , Mrs. Musgrove  --  Mary . MARY Sleep well , your Excellency  --  Father . ( She goes out . A squad of armed red coat SOLDIERS comes along from the left . They are commanded by CAPTAIN HORTON along with JOHN MATTHEWS , the sergeant under him . ) MATTHEWS Hup , hup , hup ! HORTON Get the men to their rest , Sergeant Matthews . ( MATTHEWS returns his salute. ) p. 50 MATTHEWS ( To the men . ) Dismissed . ( The men go . HORTON turns up toward the Oglethorpe room . He carries a pack and wears a sword . ) HORTON Greetings , Mrs. Musgrove . MARY ( With a touch of a curtsey . ) Master Horton ! ( MATTHEWS , who has started away , turns back at the mention of her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a word . He hurries after her . ) OGLETHORPE ( Calling out . ) Welcome , Captain Horton , welcome . Come in , man . ( HORTON lays aside his pack and unbuckles his sword as he goes in . ) HORTON ( Gesturing . ) This Indian widow is ever interested in our  --  er  --  colony . OGLETHORPE And ever helpful . ( Holding up the little book . ) She has made a little word book  --  a dictionary actually  --  of our two languages . ( Looking off . ) A gifted woman . ( HORTON nods . ) What news , Captain Horton ? You came near to the Spanish border of Florida in your exploring ? p. 51 HORTON We first established an armed post on Jekyll Island , sir , as you ordered . OGLETHORPE Good . HORTON Aye , a most strategic place and good farm land . I am claiming my five hundred acres there and will build a home . I left Sergeant Forbes in charge and well-supplied . Next we explored Cumberland Island , then back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly once more . Near its middle is a great Indian cornfield now deserted . The brambles and weeds could without much labor be cleared away for crops . OGLETHORPE Excellent . ( He and HORTON consult the map on the table . ) And this river winding in on the west side of the island is deep enough for sizable ships ? HORTON It is . OGLETHORPE From my study of the maps and what brief exploring I have been able to make , I believe we should build the capital city of Georgia on St. Simons Island . What think ye ? HORTON ( Nodding . ) I agree . The Spaniards would find it hard to reach in their big ships . OGLETHORPE And therefore the better . And look you  --  ( His finger on the map . ) Here where you say the great Indian field is , the river makes an elbow bend . A fort there would command the river in both directions . p. 52 HORTON And here at the entrance to Jekyll Sound at the southernmost point of St. Simons we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yea , the nature of St. Simons Island gives for good protection . The Spaniards themselves might have plans about it before too long . HORTON Aye , sir . Our advance scouts met with a party of them on St. Simons OGLETHORPE A-ha . ( Firmly . ) And you well asked what these Spaniards were doing on Georgia land ? HORTON I did , but only after they had asked what we were doing on land that belonged to Spain . OGLETHORPE ( Strongly . ) The island belongs to us by rightful and firm treaty with the Indians and treaty earlier with Spain back to the year 1713 . I repeated this months ago in a letter of good will to the Florida Governor Sanchez . I await his answer . I will write again . ( Strongly . ) We must build our capital , and we must have peace . HORTON Another thing , your Excellency  --  in the woods on the mainland we came across a body of Indians . The men were drunk and the women wailing that they had been cheated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 53 OGLETHORPE Once more Jonas Hampton 's men and their rum ! And all against the firm agreement signed between the two colonies . We 've protested and protested , Captain Horton . This time Hampton must be convinced we mean business . Tomorrow you must set out for Charleston with my message  --  message ? Nay , demand  --  to the Governor and to this Hampton who is the real power in that colony . ( HORTON reacts with pleasure . ) And I will set forth with a body of men to St. Simons Island to begin our fort and the laying out of our town . We must hurry . Thomas Causton for all his growling can take over here . ( Smiling . ) I wager you will not mind seeing the pretty Rebecca Hampton again . HORTON ( Fervently . ) No sir . ( He salutes and goes , picking up his pack and sword . OGLETHORPE sits to the table and begins writing rapidly . A bell sounds from the far rear of the center stage , and voices here and there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Brother Wesley calls to prayers . Evening service ! ( The light fades down on OGLETHORPE and comes up dimly on the left side-stage area . People with hymn books are seen on their way to service , led by CHARLES and JOHN WESLEY , their clear tenor voices rising in the night. ) p. 54 PEOPLE AND WESLEYS Ye servants of God , your master proclaimAnd publish abroad his wonderful name.The name all victorious of Jesus extol , His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.Etc . ( Methodist Hymnal , #169 ) ( The congregation goes onto the center stage and then diagonally off to the rear and into the darkness . The light fades . The singing continues for a moment and then gives way to a queer , guttural and dissonant harmony coming from the darkness beyond the right side-stage area . The light comes up there. ) p. 55 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE 6 A room in the Jonas Hampton mansion in Charleston , South Carolina , a tasteful place of eighteenth century grace and charm . A door is at the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets on it at the left front . Near the center rear is a window giving out onto a stretch of Hampton 's great acres . Next to this is a table . When the light comes up , REBECCA HAMPTON is standing by the window listening to the distant singing . She has a little song-book in her hand . ROLAND RUTLEDGE , an aristocratic gentleman of some 26 , is seated smoking a long-stemmed pipe and figuring in a notebook . He has a good show of lace and frills in his dress and is a typical self-indulgent Southern gentleman . He is a bit pudgy from an over-indulgence in wine and foods perhaps , but his manner is keen , his glance direct and alert as befits a successful partner of the great Jonas Hampton . REBECCA turns away from the window and back to the harpsichord . REBECCA ( As the distant singing fades down . ) The singing of the slaves is beautiful too , but  --  ROLAND I do n't know about the beauty , but I favor it . They do more work when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barbaric  --  so different from my beloved Purcell . ( She holds the songbook open and sings a bit spontaneously from it . ) When that I have often heard &nbsp; &nbsp; Young maids complainingThat when men promise most &nbsp; &nbsp; They most deceive . ( Now recitingly . ) Then I thought none of them &nbsp; &nbsp; Worthy my gainingAnd what they swore &nbsp; &nbsp; I would never believe . ( She breaks off . The distant singing dies out . ) Such heavenly things Purcell wrote ! He died when he was twenty-six , the same age as you . p. 56 ROLAND You know what I was doing while you were playing the harpsichord and singing  --  you stimulate me so  --  I was seeing the great mansion I plan for you up the Ashley River  --  you my plantation queen . REBECCA I need no other mansion , Roland . We could live here in this great house . ROLAND A gentleman must have his own home for his own wife . And I can well afford it . Do you know how many buckskins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've been adding up the accounts . REBECCA No . ROLAND One hundred and twenty-seven thousand , five hundred and sixty . ( He stretches his arms . ) Yes , ma'am , we still control the Georgia Indian trade , in spite of this James Edward Oglethorpe and his colony . ( DANIEL PERKINS , the butler , appears at the rear . He is a powerful black man about 30 . ) DANIEL Mr. Horton , ma'am , to see Massa Hampton . ( REBECCA quickly rises . HORTON enters . He wears his simple outdoor colony dress . ) HORTON ( Bowing . ) I knew I would see you again , Mistress Rebecca Hampton , and now I do . ( He steps forward , takes her extended hand and kisses it . His eyes feast on her . ROLAND has risen from his chair. ) p. 57 REBECCA ( Outwardly her calm self , though a blush is on her cheek . ) Welcome to Hampton Hall , Master William Horton . ( Indicating . ) Mr. Roland Rutledge , my father 's partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Mine , sir . ( They bow to each other . ) HORTON Pardon , but from the portico I heard a lovely voice singing one of Purcell 's great songs , was it you ? ROLAND Miss Rebecca is the mockingbird of the Charleston singing society . HORTON ( Echoing jubilantly . ) " Miss Rebecca ! " Yes she must be . He was a friend of my mother 's . She used to sing his songs around the house , especially the one you were singing . REBECCA ( With almost a cry . ) Roland , his mother knew Henry Purcell ! Think of it ! ( HORTON glances at the music on the harpsichord . ) HORTON Giles Farnaby , William Byrd . Great English musicians ! ( REBECCA looks at him . ROLAND moves over and stands by her and takes her arm somewhat possessively . HORTON goes on . ) Down at Savannah for months only hymns and labor songs . Now this  --  ( Looking about . ) And this beautiful house  --  its grounds  --  and you  --  ( His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I hear matters do not go too well with your Georgia colony . HORTON They go as well as we can make them at present . We have a noble leader . We follow him . ROLAND Oglethorpe the dreamer ! I presume he is in difficulty and you have come to Carolina for more help . HORTON I bear a message from Governor Oglethorpe to Master Jonas Hampton and to the Governor . ROLAND I will take it to Mr. Hampton . I am his partner in business . ( He holds out his hand . HORTON hesitates , then has a thought perhaps that this will get him out of the room . He hands him the letter he carries . ROLAND glances from HORTON to REBECCA , then speaks a bit decisively . ) I will return immediately , Rebecca . ( He turns and goes out . HORTON stands gazing at REBECCA . ) HORTON You are more beautiful than ever , my lady . And why not so  --  here in these most exquisite surroundings . A different world from the present Georgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us  --  see us sweating , striving mortals fighting to make , well , our dream prevail . And somehow it will . Women who never worked in England are hoeing in the fields like common laborers , gentlemen who once sported snuff to their nose and shook hand-kerchiefs of linen lace in the air are swinging picks and mattocks in the fields , broadaxes in the forests . ( With rough loudness . ) And they sing as they work , happy , most of them , to feel that they are part of a great venture here in the new world . ( He takes her hand in his own and looks at the palm ) p. 59 REBECCA ( Sharply . ) We know about their happy singing . Why do so many of them already wish to leave there and come to Carolina ? ( She tries to pull her hand away . ) HORTON Some of them do . They are the weak ones . Let them go . ( Looking at her hand . ) Soft , soft , like satin . Not much it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Temper rising in her . ) It could do more than you think , Master William Horton ! And if you have come all the way from Savannah to lecture me in your ignorance you can go back there as unlettered as you came . ( Again , she tries to pull her hand away . ) HORTON And now with all that fire in your eyes you are  --  not only beautiful  --  but  --  ( He holds her hand to his lips again and wo n't let it go . She gazes at him with burning eyes , then strikes him with her fan . He drops her hand . ) I trust your fan is not broken , ma'am . ( She goes out of the room , passing her FATHER and ROLAND entering . ) REBECCA ( Quietly . ) Mr. Horton is waiting , Papa . ( She goes . ROLAND looks off after her a moment and follows HAMPTON into the room . HAMPTON wears a sort of loose smoking jacket of red velvet and carries a long-stemmed pipe like Roland 's in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is fuming . DANIEL remains in the hall , standing in the shadows there. ) p. 60 HAMPTON This letter from Oglethorpe is an insult , sir . He demands  --  HORTON He simply says that the agreement made between him and the authorities here must be adhered to . HAMPTON Must ! Must ! And why should we keep the agreement when he does not ? He agreed to return any runaway slaves who crossed into Georgia on their way to Spanish Florida . HORTON And he has returned them as best he could , though it grieved his heart to do so . ROLAND Ten only out of more than fifty that have fled their different masters in the last year in Charleston alone . HORTON We do not have the manpower to patrol the vast Georgia woods , sir . Our rangers , our soldiers , citizens , all are asked to intercept and report these runaways . I assure you we do all we can in this . HAMPTON ( To HORTON ) . Now say this to your Governor Oglethorpe  --  that hereafter we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in pursuit of our legal property . HORTON I shall so report it to him , but I warn you against it . HAMPTON And we shall likewise protect our traders that he denounces here . ( He thumps the letter. ) p. 61 HORTON Your traders , sir , continue to maraud up and down the Georgia land filling the ignorant Indians full of rum , then paying them starving prices for their produce and leaving a people full of distrust , even vengeful feelings . They come to us pleading for justice . This is all against the signed agreement . ROLAND ( Breaking in . ) Business is competition . Henceforth , let your governor send his traders as he will and we will send ours . We 'll see who wins . HORTON Rum will win , and you know it . That 's why it is forbidden . HAMPTON ( Handing the letter back to HORTON . ) My respects to your governor , and inform him that we refuse and reject his demands , each and all . HORTON ( A little hotly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir  --  ( To ROLAND .  --  sir  --  that your slaves may escape as they will and that if your traders come into Georgia , unlicensed , with rum or without rum , they shall be arrested as criminals , their ill-gotten produce taken from them and they be drummed out of our settlement and across the river into your care and keeping . And I would doubt not that some of them would bear the mark of the lash . HAMPTON ( Fiercely . ) And bear this to your blessed governor  --  that if he should need Carolina militia in trouble with the Spaniards , he 'd best be sure that we are his friends . We might refuse him a single musket . p. 62 HORTON ( Smiling and keeping his temper as HAMPTON and ROLAND lose theirs . ) And bear this in mind yourself , Mr. Councilor , whether we like each other or not , Georgia and Carolina must stay united where Spain is concerned , each giving help to the other . Governor Oglethorpe bids me impress on you most strongly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yours . You know why , sir  --  because of his own just dealings with them . ( Bowing . ) And now farewell . We are beginning to build our little capital city on St. Simons Island . We invite you to visit us there . Good day to all . ( He goes . The two men stand looking after him . ) ROLAND A most insulting fellow . If I saw much more of him , I doubt not I 'd challenge him to a duel . HAMPTON And from what I 've seen of this Horton , you 'd be making a grievous error , Roland . ( The scene fades out . The light comes up along the front of the scene . HORTON comes along . REBECCA appears . He stops . ) REBECCA My fan is not broken , Master Horton . See for yourself . ( She hands it to him and he takes it with a deep bow . When he looks up , she is gone . He kisses the fan , puts it under his cape and hurries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprise of the Purcell song , then dies . PETER appears from the shadows . A spotlight holds on him . He is dressed for traveling and carries some sort of old carpetbag . Setting the bag down , he takes off his hat and does his familiar mopping of his face. ) p. 63 PETER With his precious fan  --  meaning whatever it might mean  --  Captain Horton hurries back to help in all the mighty pother of building our little capital city . Ahm  --  and now bad news . Our good governor 's mouth is always bigger than his stomach and his heart maybe than his head . He has been so free in issuing vouchers and bills of trade against the Trustees for the great splurge of materials and labor and supplies necessary that these same Trustees are now in rebellion against him . Fearing the worst , he has made Captain Horton acting governor and is sailing to England now to defend his work . ( He shudders . ) And he is taking me along with him . ( Giving his chuckle . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear a bell sounds . ) There 's the ship 's bell for boarding . ( Piteously . ) Pray for me , good people , on the raging waters ! ( He grabs up his bag and hurries away . The scene fades out . From the darkness of the left side-stage area we hear the voice of Sir ROBERT WALPOLE . The light comes up there. ) p. 64 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE 7 The Georgia Trustees ' meeting room in London . A time-honored place with paneled walls , a heavy table , leather chairs , etc . On the rear wall a large portrait of King George II . Some eight or ten of the TRUSTEES , with LORD EGMONT presiding , are gathered here in a meeting of dissension . SIR ROBERT is standing by the table with a document , a report from the Georgia colony in his hand . WALPOLE Enough is enough , gentlemen ! And I say this is enough . ( He holds up the document and shakes it in the air . ) From the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture . I said it would fail and it is failing . ( Murmurs of dissent are heard here from some of the men , especially from EGMONT . ) Ever increasing aid , money and supplies are called for by Governor Oglethorpe . When will it stop ? EGMONT We have not yet had time to prove the economic success of this enterprise , Sir Robert . WALPOLE You 've had two years and more . EGMONT But otherwise it is succeeding . Read the report  --  the alliance and friendship with the Indians , the land cleared , the houses built . And now the new capital which is nigh finishing and is already well-fortified. p. 65 WALPOLE I have read the report ! I advised his Majesty from the beginning that if means must be taken to care for the idle and unemployed by a colony in the New World , let it be planted in Carolina or Virginia where vast stretches of land still awaited . EGMONT ( Somewhat loudly . ) But we could not do that , sir . Those colonies use slavery . WALPOLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavery , slavery , what 's wrong with it if through slavery a colony may succeed ! EGMONT ( Again loudly . ) The principle , sir , the principle ! WALPOLE Not your principle , but Oglethorpe 's principle . You gentlemen are ever subservient to his wishes and his will . And he in his dreaming and impracticality will continue to devour huge sums and with no promise of return . ( Waggling the paper before him . ) Heretofore he has been able to persuade Parliament to help in his endeavor . I have taken roll call of the members of that honorable body and they are sick of him . I promise you no more public monies will be furnished . And from what I hear , you Trustees have expended yourselves to the limit . I move you , sirs , that the Georgia colony be given over . Let the members thereof move to Carolina , Virginia or elsewhere , or abide where they are at their own expense and risk . p. 66 VOICES Aye ! Aye ! OTHER VOICES Vote ! Vote ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancient gavel on the table . ) Order , order ! ( As the scene quiets down . ) From a sense of justice , gentlemen , we must first hear Mr. Oglethorpe give his own defense when he arrives . WALPOLE His defense , which is no defense , is here in this full report he sends us . ( OGLETHORPE and PETER come along outside the scene . OGLETHORPE hands his cape and stick to PETER . ) PETER ( Saluting . ) Your good fortune , sir . OGLETHORPE ( With a little laugh . ) And your prayers , Peter . ( He goes up into the scene . PETER looks piously upward  --  this time he means it  --  and stands to one side looking in on the scene . The TRUSTEES rise as OGLETHORPE enters . ) VOICES Greetings , Governor Oglethorpe , greetings . ( OGLETHORPE bows around and then shakes hands firmly with EGMONT . ) EGMONT ( Confidentially . ) Thank God you 've come ! p. 67 FIRST TRUSTEE A happy voyage , sir ? OGLETHORPE ( A little grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The majority of the faces are solemn . ) You gentlemen have my report there , and it is an accurate and truthful one . SECOND TRUSTEE And most discouraging . OGLETHORPE I know , for you must have the truth of our situation . ( Nodding of heads agrees emphatically . ) So you have it  --  that phase of it . I admit it has taken us longer than we had planned for our people to learn the ways and needs of the land , of the climate , and to become self-supporting . But they are learning . ( Hurrying on . ) As you know , the settling of Georgia was in part purpose to offer protection for the northern colonies from possible attacks by the Spaniards in Florida . Thus we live in consciousness of danger there . The people have accepted this place of danger , each one  --  man , woman and child . They count themselves soldiers in the service of a cause in which they believe , a cause for which so many of them have perished . FIRST TRUSTEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One out of every four died the first year in that wretched land . p. 68 OGLETHORPE ( Almost snapping . ) And the three of the four remaining are not yielding , nay , rather they are striving harder than ever in their struggle against the wilderness , carrying on with all their might in the building of their lives . Gentlemen , we have begun there in that new world an experiment unlike any that has gone before . If for no other reason , sirs , the ideals to which we are dedicated would be sufficient to warrant a devotion to the limit on the part of all of us . WALPOLE Ideals are all right , Governor , in their place , but when they are devoid of practicality , then  --  ( He snaps his fingers. )  --  it is no more than smoke  --  a dream . I say disband the colony . I move for a vote . VOICES Nay , nay . EGMONT Proceed , Governor . OGLETHORPE I beg of you , continue to give us the supplies , the new men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen . And mark ye , they have laid down their lives on a field much more honorable than the bloody field of war . VOICES Hear , hear ! OGLETHORPE It is rumored , gentlemen , and I believe it truth , that in this time of peace Spain is building up her armaments and military power of men and supplies . In time the threat to Georgia and the other colonies may be increased , is most likely to be . p. 69 WALPOLE ( Somewhat angrily . ) Even as I warned it would . OGLETHORPE Then if you weaken the colony or abandon it , Spain the more easily can overrun Georgia , then the Carolinas , Virginia and on . ( Impassionedly . ) Then what ? I 'll tell you . English civilization in America will be ended , and that great country will become a Spanish possession . And the truths of Magna Carta , of English law , of justice , of liberty , of true democracy will be ended there . Are you willing that this should happen ? ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England or for Spain . SECOND TRUSTEE ( Angrily . ) Now you would accuse us of being traitors to our country . VOICES We resent that , sir . OGLETHORPE ( His eyes searching their faces . ) Then prove the truth of your contention by saving your colony . ( Murmurs rise , pro and con , and heads are seen together here and there conferring . EGMONT is encouraged . SIR ROBERT sits scowling before him . OGLETHORPE pushes on . ) Even if you should withdraw your support for Georgia , it somehow must live . I myself have a family estate , an ancient home and lands , descended unto me from my fathers . On the market it will fetch enough to equip at least two ships with two hundred settlers each and supplies for two years . Mayhap this would turn the tide for us. p. 70 EGMONT AND OTHERS Nay , Governor Oglethorpe , you shall not make this sacrifice . OGLETHORPE It is all the land I have in this world , except the fifty acres granted to me in Georgia by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . I will add it too . ( A touch of laughter at this . OGLETHORPE goes on , his eyes burning at them . ) It is up to you gentlemen to vote your will . As for me I will never yield . Abandon the colony , but I will not abandon it . Order it moved to Carolina or Virginia , and I will not move . And there are others who will stay with me  --  draw our swords , stand firm in defense of what we believe with all our hearts to be a righteous cause . I will support the colony not only with every farthing I possess but with my blood . ( Bowing . ) Let the vote be taken . ( The scene breaks into an uproar , some applauding , some not . PETER holds the cape and stick on his arm and applauds vigorously . The scene fades out behind him as a spot holds on him . The music comes in with a happy melody , and PETER sings and does a sort of cake-walk or parade-about up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pantomiming . ) PETER ( Singing as he struts his stuff . ) Now sing out , ye brave hearts , hoist the flag , beat the drum , &nbsp; Let the streamers wave over the sea  --  There 's a land that is waiting to welcome me home , &nbsp; It 's a land that 's a homeland for me . ( He bows and steps back . OGLETHORPE , EGMONT and SIR ROBERT WALPOLE appear in the light. ) p. 71 WALPOLE ( Somewhat grudgingly . ) Well , Oglethorpe , once more the Trustees gave in to you . You won by a squeak . EGMONT And our support will continue . We 'll take up collections in the churches , canvas the various guilds , send fund-raisers to every high family in the land , eh , Sir Robert ? WALPOLE You have already done that twice , my Lord Egmont . EGMONT We 'll do it the third time . ( With a touch of grimness . ) And we 'll steal if we have to . And , Sir Robert , we need your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a choking sound . ) Er  --  eck ! EGMONT Remember , it is either England or Spain we support . WALPOLE Now you 've ruined my night for sleeping . Farewell . ( He goes huffily off into the darkness . ) EGMONT You 're convincing him  --  to help us . OGLETHORPE And his Majesty ? EGMONT He is away on the continent ,  --  ( Looking about him. )  --  with his lady love for two months . He promises us a regiment of soldiers in case the Trustees guarantee their continued support , and now we do . p. 72 OGLETHORPE A regiment ? EGMONT Aye , good tough Highlanders , to be dispatched to you from Gibraltar OGLETHORPE ( Thoughtfully . ) This added military strength in Georgia might not sit well with Spain . And yet  --  EGMONT And yet we must match strength with strength . OGLETHORPE Aye , even more than match it . EGMONT You 've heard that matters are stirring in Madrid .

A few houses showing , giving an impression of Old World village charm set here in the wilderness . A building at the right front carries the sign " Colony Supplies  --  Indian Trading . " Higher up and across the front we see a big stretched cloth sign with Scottish thistle decorations around it , reading FREDERICA WELCOMES THE HIGHLANDERS . A building across the street opposite is marked " Tavern . " The cut-outs of dwelling houses are seen edging along the street on either side toward the rear . A redcoat soldier patrols the scene there in the distance . Another redcoat soldier stands high up just behind the right tormentor on watch . The scene is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fellowship all around . OGLETHORPE , HORTON and MEMBERS of his council are going about greeting people .

( A number of people crowd around OGLETHORPE . He bows and smiles to them and shakes a hand here and there . Other colonists are entering from different directions . MARY MUSGROVE and TOMOCHICHI enter . SERGEANT JOHN MATTHEWS is accompanying MARY . The chief has aged much and walks with the aid of a long rough cudgel . He and OGLETHORPE embrace .

OGLETHORPE and HORTON now in the foreground at the left stand in an attitude of reception . OGLETHORPE has his sword out . The people up the street begin cheering and the women waving hand-kerchiefs . The bagpipe sounds close at hand now , raised in the gay tune of " Wi ' a Hundred Pipers and A " ' . The colorful figure of the BAGPIPER appears at the rear ( see illustration ) leading the way . Just behind him comes a squad of well-drilled HIGHLANDERS under the command of a high-powered lieutenant . They are all in their Highland parade dress and are armed with muskets and with dirks at their waiSt . Behind them are four or five HIGHLAND GIRLS in their costumes , whom we may consider to be wives or sweethearts of the soldiers . The squad advances along the street to meet OGLETHORPE . ) MACKAY Halt !

A few of the young girls let our squeals of fright . Some spoofing laughter results .

The high spirits are about to spill over , and now they do when the BAGPIPER strikes up in " Hares in the Meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winged-out position . The soldiers lay aside their arms and with the lassies do a Highland fling . This builds up , and some of the young people looking on start imitating . WILL WILLIAMSON comes over to SOPHY HOPKINS . She is dying to dance , her figure quivering . WILL starts leading her out , her feet already beginning to cut up . She looks appealingly at JOHN WESLEY . He shakes his head and she forlornly turns away from WILL and back to his protection from sin . The music now changes into the old Jacobite favorite " The White Cockade . " ( " My Love Was Born in Aberdeen " ) well known to most of those present , as their reaction shows . Dancing breaks out all over the place . PETER now gets ELIZABETH going a bit . OGLETHORPE cuts a few steps with MARY MUSGROVE . MARY WELCH and the WELSEYS notice this . One of the lassies leads OGLETHORPE into the figure .

( By this time OGLETHORPE and his LASS have become the center of attention as the light attests , centering more on them and fading the other people off somewhat into shadow . Off at the left front a trumpet sounds , followed by the rattle of a drum . The scene is shocked into instant stillness , and the light is shocked too , lifting back again into full illumination of the scene . Two SPANISH EMISSARIES enter at the left front  --  a Spanish soldier behind them with a white flag of truce . Two redcoat SOLDIERS accompany these three . The emissaries come forward .

Governor Sanchez sends his greetings to you , sir . OGLETHORPE ( As if interrupting . ) I count him my friend as I am a friend to him . BARBA Even so , he must obey our King . And to the point , sir , herewith a message to you from his Majesty , Philip the Fifth in Madrid , sent on by our Governor as commanded . ( He hands OGLETHORPE a message . OGLETHORPE looks at it . He shows no emotion .

The soldiers are here for defense  --  for the patrolling of this vast region , and are a threat to no one . Once more I will assure your Governor , and through him your King , of our continued friendship . I will send at once by special courier a message to Governor Sanchez .

He capers a bit as he holds her lifted hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fades out. ) @x A drum roll sounds its call for the audience to return . This is repeated . The house lights go down , and the organ strikes up in " The Girl I 've Left Behind Me , " playing it through twice , the drum accompanying . The CHORUS with its flags enters quickly from the right and left and arranges itself as before . The organ modulates into " Rule Britannia , " and the light comes up brightly on the main stage . CHORUS ( Strongly and in full face to the audience , the organ accompanying . ) When Britain first at heaven 's command , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arose from out the azure main , Arose , arose , arose from out the azure main , This was the charter , the charter of the land , And guardian angels sang the strain  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rule Britannia , Britannia rule the waves . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Britons never , never , never will be slaves .

But our Governor was ever watchful and kept us working hard to grow good crops of corn , beans , potatoes , melons , and the like for our storehouse , and we strengthened our forts and breastworks about the town . Ahm ! I have mixed enough of that tabby ooze to bury a score of Goliar giants ten fathom deep in the choking earth .

And always our hopes continue for peace , and our Governor continues his efforts with the good Governor of Florida .

OGLETHORPE Daily with you , your Excellency , I pray that our nations across the sea will restrain themselves from armed conflict and so allow our colonies , Florida and Georgia , to continue their growth and well-being undisturbed . It is of great pleasure to me that your Excellency agrees with these sentiments , and will meet with me on this most vital matter . Major William Horton offers the hospitality of his house on Jekyll Island for such a meeting .

First  --  is there any hope that we can soon begin building our chapel ? OGLETHORPE ( Shaking his head . ) I fear not , Charles . The Trustees are counting every shilling and waiting the next move from Spain .

Already the people are speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy weather we can continue to use the storehouse as best we can . Still I shall keep this in mind and work for it . WESLEY The other matter , sir , is of much more concern to me and my brother . p. 88 OGLETHORPE Yes ? WESLEY We came to the colony , your Excellency , hoping and believing in the divine purpose of spreading the Gospel among the Indians . We have been here at Frederica and at Savannah these months now and not once have you said us " yea " to go preach among them . OGLETHORPE But you have , sir , more than once accosted our good chief Tomochichi and tried to persuade him away from his God . WESLEY We pleaded that he give over his blindness and turn to the true and only God . OGLETHORPE The Creek Indians call their god Yohewa  --  not so different from Yahweh or Jehovah , is it ? To them he is a good God , ruling in heaven . I do not find much difference . ( Quietly but emphatically . ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe  --  as he chooses .

WESLEY ( Strongly . ) Your Excellency , my brother is a great man , and someday the world will know it . He is deeply troubled in his soul now . Mark ye how he prays and sings , walks the deep forest communing with his soul , reads Hebrew and Greek sources , studies and exhorts , sleeping hardly three hours the night . He has shed actual tears over his failure to bring light to some of the colonists  --  to Mistress Sophy Hopkins even . p. 89 OGLETHORPE ( A bit jocularly . ) Love complicates the matter . Advise him to marry her . WESLEY That he will never do . There is turmoiling in him a great truth , seeking to be born into the light . ( Almost fervently . ) And it will be born .

The room is in shadow for the moment and only the greensward downstage is lighted . Here a number of SPANISH AND ENGLISH SOLDIERS are gathered  --  six or eight from each country . Of the English , half are in Highland dress and half in the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type uniform . At the left is the Spanish flag with its group and at the right the English and Georgia flags with their group  --  each flag on a long staff and held by a soldier . When the light comes up , a SPANISH SOLDIER is seated on a box at the left giving an almost virtuoso rendition of pulsing music on his guitar . In the space between the groups with their flags , a SPANISH SOLDIER of lithe and whiplash form is doing a flamenco dance , his heels smacking the ground in rhythmic plops . After a bit he lets loose a flood of percussive castaneting , and the dance intensifies itself within its confining pattern . The SOLDIERS , English and Spanish , break into applause . SOLDIERS Ole ! Ole ! ' Ray ! Bravo ! ( The dance lasts for a minute or so and ends to more applause . There is good feeling in the scene , but even so , the groups stand separate and a bit wary and still bear their watchful arms . An offscene trumpet sounds a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The SOLDIERS move farther apart and stand grouped to the right and left , with an open space between them . The light comes up on the interior of the Horton house . It is a pioneer place and attractive in its sturdiness . A table is in the center of the room . OGLETHORPE and his aide WILLIAM HORTON are standing by the table facing SENOR SANCHEZ and SENOR BARBA . HORTON is reading a document. ) p. 96 HORTON ( Continuing . ) Further , the undersigned  --  Francisco del Moral Sanchez , Governor of Florida , and James Edward Oglethorpe , Governor of Georgia  --  do herein agree to restrain their soldiers and Indian allies from any attack or violence against the other colony .

Hardly had he and his party left us when a message reached me from our King and the War Council of Parliament . You have been on the water and have not heard the news . England and Spain are at war .

Our forces should be combined and the sooner the better . p. 120 HORTON And under one head . HAMPTON Hmn  --  I doubt Carolina would take on the responsibility of Georgia too .

HAMPTON I think such an attack on St. Augustine would fail . OGLETHORPE ( Abruptly . ) I fear you are right . HAMPTON Then why all this  --  ( Gesturing at the map. )  --  planning ? OGLETHORPE Because that is exactly what we must do . HAMPTON " We ? " I will take no part in it . p. 122 OGLETHORPE The King and Parliament  --  ( Indicating the message. )  --  have ordered it so .

He has freshened himself up and except for a swollen cheek and one closed eye is none the worse for wear . ) HAMPTON We must aboard for Charleston at once , Roland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horton , my honor is vindicated . As one gentleman to another I declare so . I wish you well , sir . HORTON ( Bowing likewise . ) And I you , sir . ( They shake hands . As the three move out of the room , HAMPTON calls across through the darkness toward the right side-stage area . ) HAMPTON Rebec  --  ca  --  a ! Come along ! ROLAND I have spoken to her  --  She is not coming . HAMPTON We 'll see about that . ROLAND Jonas , you know well as I do she got her stubbornness from you and she wo n't stir till she 's ready . HORTON We will gladly see to her welfare while she is here . HAMPTON ( Ragingly . ) I know you will ! ROLAND She says there 's so much to do here she wants to stay and help . Says she feels needed . ( He gives the ground a scuffing kick . ) HORTON ( Jubilantly . ) Aye , true ! Good for Rebecca . HAMPTON Come , Roland , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a uniform . Rebecca will like that  --  ( With a snort. )  --  I hope she will . We 're in a war . p. 125 ROLAND I 've just been through one war  --  and now  --  HAMPTON And now  --  war with Spain . ( To HORTON irritatedly . ) We do n't need your company , Major Horton . We know the way to our ship . HORTON I have my orders , sir . HAMPTON Orders ! Orders ! ( He cuts the air with his cane and hurries off into the shadows , HORTON and RUTLEDGE following . The light which has dimmed down somewhat in Oglethorpe 's room during this eyeblink business in front of the house now brightens inside again . OGLETHORPE is sitting at the table , his hands clasping his head . The agony of his situation is gripping him . He twists his shoulders in pain , gets up and moves back and forth in the room , then sits down again . ) OGLETHORPE ( Calling . ) Are you there , Peter Trueman ? PETER 'S VOICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in the rear door . OGLETHORPE gestures him in . ) PETER At your service , Governor  --  General . OGLETHORPE I need advice , Peter , wise advice  --  yea , comfort I need . PETER Advice is easy . As to comfort  --  that 's another matter . p. 126 OGLETHORPE Have you ever been in a situation , Peter , where whatever you did you felt it was wrong to do it  --  and yet you had to do it , had to act ? PETER Like in this war that 's coming on us , sir ? OGLETHORPE I have the King 's order to march against St. Augustine  --  and I have to obey him and Parliament . There is no time to persuade them differently . Yet if I fail , it will be my failure and not theirs . And all that we 've loved and labored for here may well be destroyed . ( Striking the table with his hand and standing up . ) And if I do not march , then the same may happen . ( He flings out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I shrink with fear and dread from this duty . PETER It 's damned if you do and damned if you do n't . But I 've learned one thing from my long and sinful life , sir . When a man has done his duty , no matter how bad it hurts for him to do it , then some sort of peace comes to him inside . Rest , Governor , rest on the truth that you have to do what you have to do , and I know you will do it to the best that 's in you . And I believe you 'll win at St. Augustine . I 've never known you to fail at anything you set your mind to . OGLETHORPE Ah , but this is the King 's mind and not mine own . Still  --  well  --  yes , even the uncertainty leads one on . p. 127 PETER I 'm not much of a believer in him up there  --  ( He gestures upward. )  --  but if he is up there , he blesses you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and all these that love you bless you here in Georgia . ( He wipes his eyes . ) OGLETHORPE And I bless you , Peter . Your counsel is ever helpful . ( He sits to the table again and examines a map . ) PETER ( With returning jovialness . ) Anyhow  --  as the old woman said when she swallowed a mouse , it 'll all work out in the end . OGLETHORPE So it will , Peter . So it will  --  good or bad  --  but  --  ( He stands restlessly up again . A low whistle is heard from the darkness behind the house . PETER looks off toward the rear . ) PETER Your Excellency  --  OGLETHORPE ( Bringing his thoughts back . ) Yes , Peter ? PETER A man in need out there  --  he wants to see you , sir . He 's been lying low till this Jonas Hampton got out of the way . ( HORTON reenters the scene at the front . ) HORTON All well aboard ship for Charleston , sir . Hardly had the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good sign , and they moved off  --  the river ahead of them like a bright ribbon in the moonlight . p. 128 OGLETHORPE Good . Bring in the man , Peter . ( PETER goes to the door and gives his low whistle , beckoning the while . DANIEL PERKINS comes quickly and quietly in . He is in pitiable condition  --  bareheaded , half-naked , his body slashed by thorns of the forests . He almost sags to the floor , but is lifted and seated in a chair . ) DANIEL ( Gasping . ) Thanky  --  suh , thanky . ( Trying to smile . ) I need a little help from you all . Yessuh . HORTON It 's Daniel Perkins , Hampton 's butler . I know him . Remember , Daniel , I came to Hampton Hall . DANIEL Yessuh , I remember . ( OGLETHORPE hurries to the corner , returns with bread and a mug of water . DANIEL takes them with a grateful look and begins eating . ) You the gentleman caused Miss Rebecca to blush in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood outside the door and heard you talk about Master Oglethorpe and freedom here . Since then I been making my plans . Then two weeks ago when the Master had gone to Beaufort I set forth . ( He finishes his bread and drink . PETER brings him a fresh mug of water . He drinks . ) And this gentleman here  --  ( Indicating PETER )  --  found me hiding out down there and slipped me up here to the governor 's house . ( Rising and standing with a slightly bowed head before OGLETHORPE . ) You are the great Governor Oglethorpe  --  must be . p. 129 OGLETHORPE And welcome , Daniel Perkins , to Frederica . ( He reaches out his hand . DANIEL from long experience as a slave hesitates before taking it . They shake man to man . ) You have come to Georgia to be free . DANIEL It is my prayer and my hope , suh . ( In sudden excitement . ) I ai n't made a mistake ! You ai n't gon na send me back . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) OGLETHORPE South Carolina has broken our treaty already . I no longer feel bound by it . ( He goes to the corner and returns , putting on his judge 's wig and gown . DANIEL shies away from him a bit . ) The court is now in session . One Daniel Perkins temporarily residing in Georgia territory brings suit , claiming that he as a human being has the natural right to be a free man . What is the judgement of this court ? Aye or Nay ? PETER AND HORTON Aye ! OGLETHORPE The court agrees . ( Turning to DANIEL . ) Daniel Perkins , this honorable court declares you are a free man from this time forth and shall have all the rights and privileges of citizenship as well as its common duties . A document signed by me as governor will attest the same . ( He reaches out to shake DANIEL 's hand again , but DANIEL in his new freedom is so moved emotionally that he does n't see it . As the verdict was announced , DANIEL 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words were pouring new power and pressure into him , which they were . He stands there now with his face lifted , his eyes closed and tears rolling down his cheeks . OGLETHORPE returns his wig and gown to their place. ) p. 130 DANIEL Hear me up there . Rejoice with me . I 'm free ! You answered my prayers . Now I do clean out my heart  --  the new flood of joy has washed it clean  --  gone all bitter black thoughts , peace is come  --  ( He slaps his great cheSt. )  --  the sunlight shines before my feet . I 'm home at last , home here with my friends , home with my brothers . ( He stands an instant now with bowed head . The others wait respectfully . He straightens up and smiles about him . ) OGLETHORPE We need every man 's strong hands here in Georgia now , Daniel . What do you wish to do ? DANIEL Your Excellency  --  yessir  --  hid out there in the woods all day , I kept watching the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to me I 'd like to be a soldier and help fight for you and Georgia when fighting is needed . OGLETHORPE Good . Daniel Perkins , I enlist you in the Georgia militia . Major Horton , take Private Perkins to the barracks . See that he is fitted with the proper uniform and furnished a musket , powder and ball and all necessary supplies and given a bed like the other men . HORTON Yes , sir . ( He salutes and so does PERKINS , for his first time . OGLETHORPE salutes back. ) p. 131 OGLETHORPE Let us all get as good sleep as possible this night . Tomorrow we must let the colony hear our direful news , get word to Tomochichi and Tooanahowie to assemble their forces , and all to be a turning and turmoil as we prepare to march against St. Augustine . Good night . HORTON AND PERKINS Good night , sir . Your Excellency . ( They go . ) OGLETHORPE And once more , Peter , my thanks for your ever wise counsel . PETER It is easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow it . OGLETHORPE But talk among friends is ever helpful . And as a friend , let me inquire as to your matrimonial plans with Elizabeth Harrison . I understand Reverend John Wesley was set to marry you some time back . PETER Like the old saying  --  A woman 's way is like the wind . She changed her mind . Pity the Wesleys saw fit to leave the colony and return to England . Maybe if they had stayed I 'd be a married man tonight . OGLETHORPE Their talents , their wishes were greater , they said , than Georgia allowed , Peter . England will provide a wider field for them . I miss Charles Wesley sorely though . As to you and Mistress Harrison being joined in wedlock , I can by virtue of my office perform such a ceremony . It will be some months before a new minister can arrive . p. 132 PETER What ! You the Governor would wed us together ? OGLETHORPE Yes . I am a magistrate . PETER ( Joyously . ) That might be the thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck her finger in the bunghole . Yea , I 'll get to ' Lizabeth at once . Good night , sir . OGLETHORPE Mayhap we can have the ceremony before we set off on our march . PETER I pray so . ( He hurries away at the rear . OGLETHORPE lays himself wearily on his rough bed . The music begins a reprise of the lullaby Rebecca hummed over the new baby  --  " Hush , Ye My Bairnie , My Bonnie Wee Laddie . " A moment OGLETHORPE lies so , then gets up and kneels by the bed in supplicating prayer . The scene slowly fades out . The reprise continues . The light comes on in a spot , revealing the SOLDIER high up on the parapet at the right . He is leaning sleepily on his musket . The music prods him with a projecting note . He straightens up , looks warily about him , and goes back to his sleepy position as before . In the darkness of the center stage left the VOICE of Oglethorpe is heard . ) OGLETHORPE 'S VOICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him speak now . VOICES No objection , your honor . Wed ' em tight and fast ! p. 133 OTHER VOICES ' Ray for Peter ! ' Ray for ' Lizabeth ! ( The music ends . The light dies from the GUARD and comes up on the center stage , emphasizing the left front . COLONISTS and SOLDIERS are assembled just before the march to St. Augustine begins . OGLETHORPE in his wig and gown is performing the wedding ceremony for PETER and ELIZABETH . The bride and groom are somewhat spruced up , PETER wearing a big red flower pinned to his waistcoat lapel and ELIZABETH a chaplet of wild flowers . Aged and decrepit TOMOCHICHI and TOOANAHOWIE with a few of their INDIAN WARRIORS are present . So is MARY MUSGROVE . With her is SERGEANT MATTHEWS , but her attention as ever is on OGLETHORPE . We see REBECCA HAMPTON among the young colonist women . And DANIEL PERKINS with his musket and new uniform is already every inch a solider . ) OGLETHORPE ( Continuing . ) By virtue of the authority vested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I now pronounce Peter Trueman and Elizabeth Harrison man and wife ! ( Applause . ) VOICES Kiss the bride , Peter ! Kiss her , ye old toad ! ( PETER does so . ) OGLETHORPE ( Handing his wig and gown to an attendant . ) And I claim the next one ! ( He kisses ELIZABETH . She curtsies . The YOUNG PEOPLE swarm around PETER and ELIZABETH . They join hands and in no time at all swing dancingly about the pair . The music strikes up , and they sing as they dance. ) p. 134 BOYS AND GIRLS O gay is the garland and fresh are the rosesYou 've culled from the garden to bind on her ( his ) brow &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O do n't deceive her ( him ) , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O never leave her ( him ) ! Surely no maiden ( laddie ) would treat his maiden &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( her laddie ) so . ( The dance and singing last about a minute or less and come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns the scene to the sombre necessity of war . Oglethorpe 's sword is handed to him . He buckles it on . The people look toward him , waiting . ) OGLETHORPE ( Calling off loudly toward the right . ) Form ranks , men ! ( HORTON turns to step away , then stops . REBECCA comes out . He lifts her hand to kiss it , then kisses her on the lips . He hurries off to the right . ) HORTON ( Calling as he goes . ) Form ranks , men ! ( Offscene at the right other voices in sequence and recedingly repeat the command to the armed forces assembled there . ) VOICES Form ranks ! Form ranks ! ( On the center stage now is much business of saying farewell . The few SOLDIERS there , redcoats and Highlanders , receive the embraces of their loved ones . OGLETHORPE draws his sword. ) p. 135 OGLETHORPE ( In a loud call . ) On to St. Augustine ! VOICES ( In a great cry . ) On to St. Augustine ! ( OGLETHORPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around him , then turns away , her shoulders heaving with sobs . SERGEANT MATTHEWS puts his arm around her , then marches away after OGLETHORPE . PETER is now seen with his musket . He shoulders it manfully . ELIZABETH is weeping . In an interval of silence we hear her half-irate voice . ) ELIZABETH Married one minute and parted the next ! Do n't you make me a widow , do n't you , Peter Trueman ! PETER Worry not , dear love . I 've got too much to come home to now  --  ever to fill an early grave instead of a bed . No Spaniard can touch me . ( He marches off . The music strikes up , a piccolo or fife effect leading in the gay " The Girl I 've Left Behind Me . " The COLONISTS stream after the marching SOLDIERS . The drums beat , the music plays , and in the sound track now we hear the rhythmic tramp of heavy marching feet . As if in time to it , the buildings in the scene move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and those on the left to the left . A wide expanse is open before us . The light downstage center now fades out and a great horizontal shaft of light down near our lake appears , coming in from left to right . The head of the bright and colorful troop procession is seen entering there from the right , drummers and flagbearers going before . The procession is so arranged , much in single file , that the sense of numbers is effective . OGLETHORPE on his horse comes galloping along near the edge of the lake and beyond the marching soldiers . He reins his horse up and inspects the troops as they pass by . He lifts his hand in a salute to the INDIAN TOTEMS as they pass Some of the SOLDIERS carry baggage rolls , cooking equipment , etc . The gay music continues , and ever the tramp , tramp of the marching feet  --  a colorful and tingling eye-blink scene . OGLETHORPE gallops off at the left rear to head the march . The great shaft of light begins to fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drumbeat and tramp of feet receding , receding until all is still and dark . Suddenly the music pours in with full organ power in a reprise of the whole melody and dies down to a few repeated soft chord effects , holding these for some ten seconds and fading out . After a few heartbeats of time , an intermittent and dull under-the-earth booming of heavy cannon begins far off at the left rear . PETER appears in a spotlight in the left side-stage area . He carries a sword now instead of a musket and in his bearing and clothing shows well the wear and tear of being a soldier . One sleeve of his coat is torn and his old hat is wrinkled and out of shape . When he appears , the bombardment subdues itself for a bit. ) p. 136 PETER And so it was six weeks ago we marched away from Frederica with flags flying , music playing and women 's kisses and tears a-following us . Six blessed weeks ! Here we are camped on Anastasia Island before St. Augustine and shooting shells every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Spanish flag still flies and the soldiers there come out on the walls and laugh at us . Through our spy glass we 've seen ' em do it . I fear the Governor 's fears were well-founded about the strength of this place . Already there is much grumbling among Colonel Hampton 's South Carolina troops and talk of giving over the siege and going home . ( A SOLDIER comes hurriedly in from the darkness . ) SOLDIER A message for the Governor ! PETER Over there ! ( He gestures . The SOLDIER goes . PETER follows after him . The light fades and comes up in a confined circle at the right center of the main stage. ) p. 137 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Oglethorpe 's tent on Anastasia Island , Florida . OGLETHORPE is standing in front of the tent with a field glass to his eye . HORTON is standing by him . The bombardment has resumed its volume . OGLETHORPE lowers the glass and shakes his head . HORTON takes the glass and looks off but only for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands the glass back . OGLETHORPE ( Yelling off . ) Silence the guns ! A VOICE ( In the distance . ) Silence the guns ! ( The intermittent bombardment stops . OGLETHORPE paces up and down . HORTON sits on a box or lump of baggage , takes bread from his knapsack and chews on it . ) OGLETHORPE ( After a moment . ) Every day you grow more silent , Major Horton . HORTON When results are so few , your Excellency , few words become them . OGLETHORPE True . Naught goes well so far . ( Strongly . ) But is will  --  it muSt . Our Indian allies have the town ringed from the west , and the Highlanders at Fort Moosa threaten from the north . And here we have a sea blockade , and no supplies reach the city . In time the white flag of surrender will show . It will ! ( He beats his hands together and paces up and down again. ) p. 138 HORTON May it show in the next few days lest the great Spanish fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up the field glass and looks through it . ) OGLETHORPE The great fort shows no hurt yet , and in the past weeks we have fired two thousand shells at it . ( He lowers the glass and turns on HORTON , his voice suddenly harsh . ) Is any animal on earth as stupid as man , Major Horton ? HORTON ( Closing his knapsack . ) I think not of man as an animal , sir . OGLETHORPE He is just that when he is engaged in this business  --  war  --  dog eat dog . Here am I a man of good will  --  or try to be  --  one who always hopes to see the best in his fellowman , knowing this is the way to find the best in one 's self  --  and yet I am trying to starve helpless women and children in the town there till their menfolk surrender . HORTON ( Rising . ) This is the way things are  --  they are just that way , General Oglethorpe . OGLETHORPE But it should n't be  --  Nay !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ! ( The VOICE of a SENTRY is heard at the right rear ) p. 139 SENTRY 'S VOICE Halt ! PETER 'S VOICE A message for the General . ( PETER and the MESSENGER enter . ) MESSENGER From Captain William Cooke , sir . ( He hands OGLETHORPE the message . OGLETHORPE takes it and passes it on to HORTON who reads it . ) HORTON St. Augustine wo n't go hungry for awhile , sir . A Spanish supply ship has slipped through our channel blockade . ( For a moment OGLETHORPE stands motionless , saying nothing . Then he turns quietly to the MESSENGER . ) OGLETHORPE My respects to Captain Cooke for his message . Inform him I will meet with him later . ( The MESSENGER salutes and goes . ) HORTON Someone was sleeping on his watch to let that vessel through . OGLETHORPE ( An almost savage note in his voice . ) Later we 'll find the guilty man and woe to him when he comes before my court martial ! Aye ! ( He grinds his hands together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their reSt . Before dawn we 'll make a land attack  --  Our Indians and Highlanders will storm the town from the rear  --  we bombarding with every gun we have and setting a force ashore across San Sebastian River  --  or trying to . ( He sinks down in his tent chair and bows over , a heavy cough wrenching his frame . PETER moves solicitously to him. ) p. 140 PETER Come , sir  --  to your bed . I 'll keep watch and wake ye ! ( He helps OGLETHORPE along . ) Whew , your very arm is hot to my touch ! OGLETHORPE ( Grimly . ) This fever comes and goes . A little sleep is all I need . Sleep . But then the women and children march round my bed , crying with hunger . ( He shudders . ) Get word to Tooanahowie and Captain MacKay about the land attack , Major Horton . First to Colonel Hampton as to the landing . HORTON ( Sharing Peter 's concern . ) But you are not well , sir . Later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late ! ( HORTON salutes and turns abruptly away . As he goes through the darkness , his voice is heard . ) HORTON 'S VOICE Lights out ! To your rest , men . Lights out ! ( OGLETHORPE stretches himself out on his tent pallet . PETER spreads a blanket over him . ) PETER Sleep well , General . OGLETHORPE Sleep , you say , sleep ? PETER Aye , for four good hours ! ( He comes out of the tent and sits in the chair . The light dims down on OGLETHORPE in the tent and remains on PETER . In the distance a bugle blows its call to sleep and reSt . The scene fades down to a suffusion of light on Peter as he sits humped in his chair . The call is repeated , this time in another part of the camp and farther away in the darkness  --  a sort of benediction in its sleepy golden tones . The offscene music ( organ ) comes in with its own sympathetic and understanding comment  --  the old folksong , " Farewell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is concluding , JONAS HAMPTON 's irate VOICE is heard in the darkness at the rear ) p. 141 HAMPTON 'S VOICE Hang the password . I 'm Colonel Hampton ! ( The light flares up on the scene . PETER has risen out of his chair . He hurries to meet HUMPTON who comes striding in . RUTLEDGE , now a lieutenant , is with him . They are both in military uniform . ) PETER The General is feverish , Colonel Hampton , and is seeking a morsel of sleep . HAMPTON Feverish is right and in the brains ! ( OGLETHORPE climbs wearily to his feet and comes out of his tent . ) OGLETHORPE ( Saluting . ) Your pleasure , Colonel Hampton . HAMPTON Your order was received . It is to prepare for a landing across the river before dawn . Is that true ? OGLETHORPE It is . HAMPTON Out of the question , sir . My men are in no mood for such a risky venture . OGLETHORPE ( Staring at him . ) You are their commanding officer and they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , when I order them so . But , sir , one-third of my men are sick of body and the rest sick of heart and mind over this entire business . They are in a mood to throw over this wasteful venture and return home . Days and days go by and they rot here . p. 142 OGLETHORPE This bespeaks some lack in the morale and authority of their commander , does it not ? HAMPTON We resent that , General Oglethorpe ROLAND We do . OGLETHORPE You speak of rot  --  of inaction . Now they shall have action a-plenty before the dawn comes . HAMPTON I will never order my men to land across the river under the guns of that fort . OGLETHORPE We will silence those guns with our guns . ( Vehemently . ) We will ! Colonel Hampton , you have your orders ! In this crisis you can not disobey . To do so would be to  --  ( He gestures . ) HAMPTON ( Sneering . ) I understand your threat , sir . OGLETHORPE It is no threat  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges against me before the King . OGLETHORPE ( Relentlessly . ) I would  --  of cowardice . HAMPTON ( Gripping his sword hilt , trying to keep the fury out of his voice . ) And so the failure of this siege would be blamed on me. p. 143 OGLETHORPE Yes . HAMPTON I prefer the blame be on you , sir . For it is bound to fail . OGLETHORPE You forget the valor of our Highlanders , waiting at Fort Moosa the word to attack . And our Indians are likewise waiting . Together I believe we can win  --  HAMPTON Very well , I obey . Come , Roland , we must face our troops . ( Turning . ) Let the air witness I am opposed to this attack . ( HORTON enters from the shadows . With him is a blood-stained and power-blackened Highlander CHARLES MACKAY . ) HORTON It is too late for an attack now , General . I met Lieutenant MacKay at the river 's edge on my way to Fort Moosa . He will tell you . ( MACKAY steps forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice as he gives a groggy salute . ) Fort Moosa has fallen to the Spaniards , Sir . OGLETHORPE ( With a cry . ) Nay , nay , it can not be ! HORTON And half of the Highland force has been destroyed . ( OGLETHORPE feels blindly about him in the air , and with a groan sinks down into his chair . ) The rest have scattered . I tried to rally them .  --  Tooanahowie and his Indians failed us . Captain Palmer is dead . p. 144 OGLETHORPE ( Hoarsely . ) How  --  how was this allowed ! MACKAY Under cover of darkness  --  the Spanish Indians crept silently upon our outposts and murdered them without a sound . Then they and the Spaniards burst in upon us . OGLETHORPE ( Bitterly . ) And found you herded together in the fort . I warned Captain Palmer  --  ordered him to stay outside that fort ready to move forward or backward at any moment . ( His voice almost a moan . ) Ah  --  those men ! Poor  --  brave men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no attack now , General ? ( OGLETHORPE shakes his head , sitting bowed over , the misery of death in him . ) OGLETHORPE I have failed . HAMPTON Before dawn my troops will break camp and start for Carolina . She needs every man for her defense now . Good night , General Oglethorpe . ( He and RUTLEDGE hurry away without saluting . OGLETHORPE sits as he is . PETER stands by him . The scene fades out . Somewhere in the darkness a drum begins beating , and here and there distant voices are heard giving commands . ) VOICES Fall in , men ! Home ! We 're going home ! ( Cheers are heard. ) p. 145 OTHER VOICES ' Ray ! ' Ray ! ( And now voices of another sort come in . ) VOICES Down with Oglethorpe ! Down with him ! ( PETER appears in the left side-stage area in a spotlight now . In the soundtrack the tramp of marching feet is heard , but no gay fife or piccolo accompanies the tramping this time . PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) PETER The siege was given over now , and back home we turned our heavy steps . Tramp , tramp , tramp , the long , long miles ! But still to know that loved ones awaited us in spite of our failure lifted our hearts somewhat .

He returned to Frederica a sick and broken man . ( He gestures toward the center stage . The light comes up there .

ELIZABETH TRUEMAN and REBECCA are present , both looking off expectantly toward the left where the soldiers are entering . ZEISBERGER AND his wife are seen . HORTON and a group of disheveled MEN enter . He gestures the MEN to go their own way and they do . He turns toward REBECCA . They gaze at each other a moment and then HORTON is over to her and has her in his arms . The anxious ELIZABETH is over at the left now looking off . She waves her kerchief , seeing PETER coming there . The music strengthens a bit , and the attention of the people goes to the left front especially where the light has brightened somewhat . OGLETHORPE is helped along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body weak from illness . He tries to stay on his feet as best he can . He gives a wavering smile and a little hand salute to his beloved people .

ELIZABETH hurries up and walks along with PETER as he assists the sick man . Presently OGLETHORPE is in his old room at the left and the light shadows down from the rest of the environment and centers somewhat there on the interior .

HORTON ( Calling . ) Let all away to their work and duties now . BIG ED Come , people , come ! ( The people move away to the right and to the left . The scene fades down , the music comes in finishing the last nine bars of " Flowers in the Valley " for segue music . PETER appears in a spotlight in front of the tavern . ) PETER Not Dr. Hawkins but Mary Musgrove attended the Governor now with her medicines . And in less than a fortnight he was on his feet again  --  weak but on his feet . And well it was so , for our scouts brought news that the first of the great Spanish fleet had arrived at St. Augustine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas Hampton and Carolina were seeing now to their own defenses . Where could we turn for aid against the Spaniards ? Only the Governor could give the answer . ( A touch of pride coming into his voice . ) Odds splinters and blades , he has appointed me an honorable member of the Council . We are meeting now . ( He walks down into the side-stage area , the light fading out to come up on the interior of Oglethorpe 's room. ) p. 157 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE 6 The Council is gathering  --  OGLETHORPE , HORTON , NOBLE JONES , PETER , LIEUTENANT MACKAY , COOKE AND DEMERE . Most of the men sit . OGLETHORPE stands by his table , a stout cane giving him support . OGLETHORPE Gentlemen , there is no possible hope of matching our military strength against that of Spain . Shall we stand and fight or desert the colony and be certain of safety for our people ? ( He looks about the room . ) HORTON You know the answer , General . We will fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , to a man . OGLETHORPE Then how to fight is the question . ( With a wry smile . ) Mayhap there was some value in my feverish state of recent days . Never were images and visions and plans and scenes more vivid to my mind than then . And beating through all the turmoil in my brains was the constant refrain  --  Outdo the Spaniards . You must outdo them . Some nights a-gone a picture flared in on me  --  a plan perhaps to take their troops in a surprise . Within seven or eight days the attack will be made on this island . VOICES ( In alarm . ) A handful of days only ! p. 158 OGLETHORPE They will first attack Fort St. Simons at the south of the island . I am sure of that . Then they will move against Frederica here . And how will they move ? How ? ( He looks about him . ) HORTON Up the river , sir . OGLETHORPE True , unless they are prevented . I propose that we sink enough of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only four ships , sir . OGLETHORPE That should be sufficient . Then they would slowly make their way through the thick woods  --  HORTON And in the thick woods we could fight them Indian fashion from tree to tree . OGLETHORPE That would be but man against man . ( Shaking his head . ) I propose we make it easy for them to march toward Frederica . VOICES Easy ? What do you mean , sir ? OGLETHORPE ( Grimly . ) I am not in fever again . I propose we cut a road from St. Simons Fort along the marsh , leading to Frederica  --  on one side then the thick woods  --  on the other the marsh into which hundreds , thousand of disorganized men could sink helpless before a few murdering muskets . Major Horton , could we cut such a road in six days ? That would give us one day to spare . p. 159 HORTON With every soldier , every colonist  --  man , woman and child  --  helping , we might . OGLETHORPE We can still muster night four hundred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer chief , but his influence is great and he and Tooanahowie will support us again  --  with , some six hundred warriors . These we could plant in ambush along the road we cut and at the proper moment as the Spanisards march blithely along fall upon them in a surprise . After they capture Fort St. Simons they will count ultimate victory easy and certain and mayhap they will be the more careless . They will not forget I have already failed at St. Augustine . HORTON Excellent ! It might succeed . NOBLE JONES AND OTHERS A chance  --  aye , perhaps a chance . OGLETHORPE If we can give the enemy a first and decisive blow  --  ( Staring off , his mind working furiously , speaking somewhat as if to himself. ) missing page 131 p. 160 Act 2 , Scene 7 SCENE 7 To be worked out with the Director , Choreographer , Technical Directors , etc . A view of the marsh on St. Simons Island , with the edge of the woods showing upstage beyond it . The Frederica set has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road is presumed to run along between the woods and the marsh . The offscene drum begins beating and continues . OGLETHORPE gallops in on his horse from the right , accompanied by Tooanahowie on foot and two or three of his swift scout runners . OGLETHORPE proceeds up the road to the left a bit , appraising the scene around and the landscape in the distance . He is satisfied and turns back . He gestures beckoningly off right , then gallops back that way . The troops come skeeting in across the scene , the two flags carried along horizontally and unmarkedly now . SOLDIERS , both redcoats and Highlanders , enter in somewhat scattered and strung-out file . TOOANAHOWIE leads more of his INDIANS off to the left and then immediately back across the scene at the left rear to hide along with the soldiers in the woods down near the lake . This " woods " may have to be some sort of stage property arrangement  --  cutouts or whatnot  --  run in on a track . The entrance of the soldiers is quick , furtive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of a good-sized body of men . The sensitive lighting will give us the right emphasis as to military personnel and quality of action here . PETER appears at the right front , wearing his sword , and shows his interest in what is taking place . He is watchful and on the qui vive . Now the troops are all hid in the woods . The drum continues its beating . The two flags , of Georgia and England , appear for an instant far at the rear , lifted high above the " woods " and then lowered . The drum stops beating . PETER They 're coming ! ( Far off at the left the sound of martial music is heard ( in the organ ) , and the SPANISH SOLDIERS ' singing is heard with it . PETER peers out from behind the right tormentor . ) All in careless and holiday mood they come . Why not ! St. Simons Fort is theirs and the English dogs have scattered like leaves in the wind before the power of Spain . ( He steps back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The head of the Spanish force enters at the left rear with the Spanish flags . ANTONIA BARBA is in charge . He gives the command to halt . The singing of the Spanish National Anthem stops . Here follows the historical action of the Spaniards laying aside their arms and preparing to cook their rations before proceeding to the capture of Frederica . We see only some eight or ten SPANISH SOLDIERS on stage , the rest of the force presumed to be off along the road to the left . The bits of dialogue as well as the singing are in Spanish . PETER peeps out at the scene in astonishment . ) By the mass , they are stopping to eat . ( Gleefully . ) Aye , let them take siesta ! Hail Oglethorpe and Georgia ! ( He draws his sword , cuts the air with it and dashes off and out through the right side-stage area . The light now emphasizes the Spanish group . BARBA sets his GUARD and FLAGBEARER at the left rear . The music has softly continued as background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , chatter , and some of them even lie back with their hands behind their heads to snooze a bit . The music stops abruptly . BARBA rises , looks warily about , seems satisfied , sits down again . The GUARD gazes about , is satisfied too and leans restfully on his musket . Suddenly the dark bodies of TOOANAHOWIE and HILLISPILLI charge through the air and upon the GUARD and FLAGBEARER , killing them with their knives . At the same moment they let loose their war cry , and the drum starts beating again . The GEORGIA TROOPS storm out of the " woods " following their flags and onto the SPANIARDS . BARBA tries to rally his men , but in a moment they are all swept out and off along the road to the left . The actual fighting now takes place offscene . I hope the battle sounds here can be kept to a minimum , and most of them musicalized in the organ . The flashes and explosions also should be for the eye primarily . The battle has hardly started when numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , watching the battle . Their concern carries them onto the mainstage and there they show in their reactions ( choreographed ) the progress of the fighting . Turning away in fright , then cheering , etc . Some of them get so charged up that they pantomime the clubbing , shooting and stabbing taking place there in the distance . The battle music written especially for this does its part emotionally . Finally the SPANIARDS are beaten , destroyed even . Cheers offscene , then cheers , leapings and hugs of joy onstage. ) p. 161 VOICES Victory ! Victory ! etc . ( The drum thunders away , the music sounds its triumph , and now the VICTORS and their flags , including the captured Spanish ones , appear . Some of the men blood-stained . Embraces , tears , etc . The drums and music stop . OGLETHORPE appears . The people 's adulation for him . His few sober but intense remarks pointing to the future .
