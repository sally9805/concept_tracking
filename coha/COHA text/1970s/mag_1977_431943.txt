" The Celts were a group of related tribes , linked by language , religion , and culture , that gave rise to the first civilization north of the Alps . They emerged as a distinct people in the eighth century B.C. ? about the time Homer was composing his Iliad and Odyssey , the Olympics were starting , and legendary Romulus and Remus were founding Rome . The Celts were energetic , and most inventive . They introduced to northern Europe the use of iron .

Yet these tribes are known as a distinct eople because of similarities in language , religion , and material culture . 1t its height in the third century before Christ , the Celtic realm extended from : ae North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Black Sea to the Atlantic .  |p588  they created Europe 's first major industrial revolution , its first common market , its first international court of arbitration . Celts to handsaws , chisels , files , and other tools we use today . They developed seamless iron rims for their wheels ; set our standard 4-foot-81/2-inch railroad gauge with the span of their chariots ; pioneered the iron plowshare , the rotary flour mill , a wheeled harvester two millennia before Cyrus McCormick ? and secured women 's rights centuries before late bloomers began to roast male chauvinist pigs . Celts measured time not in days but in nights , divided months into a bright half and a dark half , and created an art style of uncanny beauty that endured 1,500 years . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance of Tristan and Iseult , so Celtic in its ardent beginning and tragic ending . They also devised a cagey put-off for paying up : Since Celts saw no real break between life and death , a debt could be carried over into the otherworld . At their height , around the third century B.C. , their sway extended from the " end of earth , " Cape Finisterre in Spain , all the way to the Black Sea , and from the North Sea to the Mediterranean . Map names trace their spread along Celtic rivers : Danube , Rhine , Seine , Thames , Shannon . In Celtic settlements such as London , Lyon , Geneva , Strasbourg , Bonn , Vienna , Budapest , Belgrade , Coimbra , Ankara . Paris recalls the Parisii , a Celtic tribe , and Rheims the Remi .

And the Gauls of Caesar 's Gallic wars were related to the Gaels of Ireland and Scotland , to the Celts of Galicia in Spain and Galicia in Poland , and to the Galatians in Asia Minor , to whom St. Paul sent an Epistle . So the Celts were not on the fringe but central to Europe 's rise . I 'd find their culture surfacing in many surprising survivals . AT MEDIEVAL Charles University , clustered about the Old Town Square in Prague , in Bohemia , I met Professor Jan Filip , patriarch of Celtic prehistory . The vigor of his stride belied his three score and 16 years . " Where did the Celts originate ? " I asked . " From what ethnic roots ? " With his strong hands he made a swath through Europe 's heartland , from Bohemia and Austria through southern Germany and Switzerland to eastern France . " Here , at the dawn of the Iron Age , a confederation of tribes known later as the Celts emerged from a prehistoric complex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial practices . Nearest in time are the Urnfield people . Their large cremation cemeteries show a farming folk settling about 1200 B.C. amid the Tumulus culture , whose burial mounds are contemporary with the Bronze Age Mycenaean civilization in Greece . And before them came the Corded Ware or BattleAx people of 2300 B.C. Philologists think these people were the first Indo-European speakers to enter central Europe . " Modern archeology has achieved a new and fuller picture of the Celts before they burst upon the European stage . While they never managed to forge an empire , a stable state , or even an absolute ethnic unity , they laid the economic , social , and artistic foundations of northern European civilization . We owe a great debt to this Celtic heritage . " An early snow was spreading a white pall over the vast prehistoric cemetery at Hallstatt as I hiked up a hanging valley in the Salzkammergut region of Austria . Here , beginning in 1846 , systematic excavation  |p589  revealed two thousand Iron Age graves , the greatest assemblage then known . It yielded long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jewelry with striking geometric and animal motifs . More sumptuous grave finds in this style ? often including a ceremonial wagon to speed the warrior to the otherworld and a haunch of boar to feast him en route ? later came to light near princely citadels of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. along the upper Danube nd Rhine . Wine amphorae from Massalia Marseille ) , founded near the mouth of the Rhone by Greeks in 600 B.C. , a gold spoon , and garments embroidered in silk hint at the ostentatious wealth at the Heuneburg , a Hallstatt chieftain 's stronghold , still being excavated in Wurttemberg . But it was the simpler graves at Hallstatt , opening a window on an early industrial community that traded salt mined at the head of this remote and lofty valley , that named an archeological age . My companion that snowy day at Hallstatt was Dr. Fritz Eckart Barth of Vienna 's Natural History Museum . We climbed to a tunnel cut into the Salzberg , Salt Mountain , where men have burrowed for 3,000 years . We squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barth 's crew . With his light he traced a heart-shaped lump of rock . I ran my fingers over it and licked them . Salt . But why the heart shape ? " Cut this down the center , crack out the lobes , and you get two chunks . Each just fits into a miner 's backpack , " said Dr. Barth . In Hallstatt 's museum I had seen a leather backpack , pick and spade , firebrands that lit the miner 's toil , leather cap , shoe , even pieces of the rough-woven tunic he wore . But I was a couple of centuries too late to meet an ancient Hallstatt miner in the flesh . Dr. Barth took me to the place where in 1734 miners discovered a Celt buried in salt . " Probably caught in the avalanche of about 300 B.C. , which filled the shafts . It preserved him like a salted fish . " Miners carried him down to the village . But superstitious villagers feared this " devil , " and the priest cast him out . A pagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So we do n't know where he ended up , " said Barth . During the Hallstatt period , Celtic culture flourished in much of Europe . From Spain and Britain all the way to Hungary , hill forts and fortified settlements rose ? serving not just as chieftains ' citadels , refuges for man and beast in time of peril , and religious sanctuaries , but increasingly also as centers of commerce , production , and population . Mont Lassois , near the headwaters of the Seine , I found hauntingly lonely . Only hints of rampart amid the brambles told of life twenty-five centuries ago in this citadel in eastern France . I looked down over the clustered red-tiled roofs of the village of Vix to a field along the tree-shaded Seine . There in 1953 Rene Joffroy made one of this century 's most exciting finds . In the mud and snow of that river-invaded field he discovered vestiges of a Hallstatt tumulus 138 feet across and perhaps 20 feet high . GalloRoman settlers had leveled it centuries ago , quarrying its stone for houses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial chamber . Amazingly , it had not been rifled . Around 500 B.C. , in summer when the river was low , a woman about 30 years old was laid to rest on a funerary wagon in a woodlined pit in the sand . Decked in brooches and surrounded with riches , she wore an arc of gold on her head . A Celtic princess ! In the museum at Chatillon sur Seine I studied that elegant diadem , ending in knobs graced with winged horses in Scythian style ; the amber jewelry , the silver bowl , bronze basins , the black-figured Attic cup , the splendid Etruscan beaked flagon . But I marveled most at the bronze krater with archaic Greek warriors and chariots marching around its rim ? the most stupendous Greek winemixing vessel ever found . Its very size intoxicates : Thirteen feet around , it stands as tall as a man and weighs 460 pounds . Bespeaking the Celts ' wealth and love of finery , the treasure of Vix attests to trade links with the Etruscans in north-central Italy and the Greeks in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtic society . Three sumptuous burials are known near Vix : Two are of women . What did the Celts give in return for this krater and the wine to fill it ? Mont Lassois ' wealth derived not from the usual Celtic trade in slaves or iron or pork but from tolls , Rene Joffroy said . Controlling the head of navigation on the Seine and the tin route from Britain , the fortress could exact heavy tribute .  |p590  Here Cornish tin coming upriver by boat was transshipped by packtrain over Alpine passes or down the Rhone corridor to Massalia , and thence to the bronze workshops of Italy . Merchants gathered to exchange the goods of two worlds . " So this splendid krater most likely was a diplomatic gift by the southern merchants to assure that the route would stay open , " concluded Joffroy . " And like diplomatic gifts today it might have been kept for display and never used for mixing wine . " But with that punch bowl 's 1,200-bottle capacity , I could n't help thinking what bacchanals the princess could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst . IN THE SEVERE WINTER of 1853-54 , lowering waters in Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland uncovered votive offerings at a site called La Tene , The Shallows . a Excavations in 1880-85 and 1907-17 produced 2,500 weapons , utensils , and scabbards with refined , curvilinear designs that were distinct from the earlier , geometric Hallstatt style . Archeologists , who had named the early Iron Age north of the Alps ( about 800-500 B.C. ) after Hallstatt , the Austrian site , called the later Iron Age ( about 500-50 B.C. ) the La Tene period , after the Swiss site . Early in the La Tene period , coinciding with the Golden Age of Greece , there was a wave of Celtic expansion , probably due to overpopulation and social tensions . Younger sons of chieftains would set out with part of the tribe to carve out swordland of their own . The sword they wielded was a masterpiece of forging ? varying hardnesses of carbon steel layered into a long and narrow blade , sharp-edged and flexible .

( Continued on page 600 ) Presiding at a stag hunt , a ten-inch goddess towers over her warriors on a miniature bronze cult wagon from Strettweg , Austria . The cart was buried with a chieftain in the seventh century B.C. By then metalworking was transforming the Celtic world , especially in art and in the use of iron for weapons and tools .  |p600  Celts now used the two-wheeled war chariot , and cavalry in tactical units of three ? a noble and two companions . Tribal foot soldiers , armed with spears and slings , bore tall wooden shields adorned with metal bosses . It was in this wave of expansion that Celts fell upon the cities of the classical world , shocking them by the force of their assaults , their reckless courage , their thirst for plunder . In 387 B.C. Gauls sacked Rome . Others pushed eastward along the Danube , traversed the Balkans , and in 279 B.C. pillaged the famed Greek sanctuary of Delphi . Some 20,000 Gauls crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor , settling around Ankara , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galatians . Six centuries later St. Jerome found the Galatian speech similar to that of the Treveri he had heard at Trier on the Moselle . In demand as mercenaries , Celtic bands ranged as far afield as Sicily and Egypt . Much about these warriors caught the classical eye . Gallic he-men bleached their hair , adorned themselves with jewelry , loved loud tunics and checked cloaks . That their " barbarian " speech would grate on GrecoRoman ears was only to be expected of outlanders who wore not the " civilized " toga but the trousers of a horse-riding people . Some wore chain mail . Others fought naked . Clad only in torques , or sacred collars , and bracelets , with limed locks stiffened like a horse 's mane , and sporting formidable mustaches , Celtic champions would strut before the foe , brandishing their arms , boasting Riot of shape and texture , this inch-wide gold bead from Hungary exemplifies the profuse decoration common to Celtic art . Borrowing elements from classical and eastern art , Celts added imagination and superb craftsmanship . The resulting style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far from the symmetry and naturalism of Greek art . of their prowess , hurling taunts and insults . They not only looked big , some were big . Near Milan , a city the Celts founded , Italians recently unearthed the skeleton of a warrior who stood six feet five . Certainly they were magnificent physical specimens . For one thing , they exercised girth control . A fat warrior was fined . The Celtic assault , when it came , curdled the blood : the blare of giant boar-headed war trumpets , the clatter of chariots , the hammer of hooves , the whir of slingstones , the thud of spears , the shock of shields , the clang of swords , the neighs and shouts and screams . " The whole race . . . is madly fond of war , " comments the Greek geographer Strabo . And Diodorus Siculus , the Greek historian , tells us , " They cut off the heads of enemies . . . and attach them to the necks of their horses . " Singing in triumph as they carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They embalm in cedar oil the heads of the most distinguished enemies , and preserve them carefully in a chest , and display them with pride to strangers .... " In Marseille and Aix en Provence in France I saw niches with skulls and rows of stone heads from the Celtic shrines of Roquepertuse and Entremont . Feasting when not fighting , or hunting , or trying to outdo one another wrestling , gaming , or racing their treasured horses , hotheaded Celtic warriors often turned feasts into bloody brawls . Gathering in a chieftain 's hall , sitting cross-legged on wolf skins , they would consume prodigious portions of wild  |p601  boar . And guzzle wine , beer , or mead until they fell " into a stupor or a state of madness , " reports Diodorus . Jugglers or buffoons entertained in the light from the blazing hearth . A bard , strumming a lyre , would recite bold deeds of his host . Guests would top one another 's tales of valor . Tempers flared ; drawn swords glinted .

Greek historian Posidonius tells us : " When the hindquarters were served up , the bravest hero took the thigh piece , and if another man claimed it , they stood up and fought in single combat to the death . " But if we think these men rough , here 's what Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus says of the gentler sex : " A Gallic woman , fighting beside her man , is a match for a whole troop of foreigners . Steely-eyed . . . she swells her neck , gnashes her teeth , flexes her huge white biceps , and rains wallops and kicks as though from the twisted cords of a catapult . " And when Queen Boudicca of the Iceni took the warpath in her chariot , she shredded Roman legions and burned Londinium ? Roman London ? to the ground . Not that all Celtic women were Amazons , nor that all Celtic men looked like " The Dying Gaul , " that famous Hellenistic statue of a Galatian warrior . Many were short and dark haired . " The tall , fair-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling caste spread thinly over indigenous populations , " Professor Filip. had pointed out . But this Celtic aristocracy , imposing its language , artistic tastes , and way of life on the populace , set the style of civilization consolidated in the economic expansion that followed the La Tene conquests . ANCHING , capital of the Vindelici tribe in Bavaria , burgeoned inside a four-and-a-half-mile wall , its thousand acres nearly as extensive as Republican Rome . Sited to control two trade arteries , where the east-west route along the Danube intersects that between the Northern European Plain and the Adriatic , Manching traded grain from its 160 storage pits , smelted and smithed iron and copper , tanned hides , milled flour , produced colored glass and painted wheel-made pottery , and minted gold and silver coins . Door locks on the narrow wooden houses guarded private property . . Craft specialization , improved tools , and standardized design , artfully blending form and function , spurred mass production of metalware and ceramics for export from such proto-industrial settlements . Artisans and merchants in search of patrons and profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a La Tene invention , indicates tracks now extended across rocky terrain , cruel to unprotected hooves . Religion was another bond in Celtic society . Each tribe had its local deities and cults ; hundreds of names of gods and goddesses are known to us . But their roles and rites had much in common ? just as the priestly caste of Druids was a pan-Celtic institution . Druids exercised great political influence , forecasting the future , fixing auspicious times for enterprises , educating the young nobility , conserving traditions . Once a year they met in solemn assembly in Chartres , tribal center of the Carnutes , in Gaul . There they settled disputes between nobles , and even mediated conflicts between tribes . To enforce their judgments , this supertribal court wielded the weapon of excommunication ? exclusion from the sacrifices central to Celtic religion . Tacitus tells us of the bloodstained Druid altars of Anglesey in Wales . Caesar describes mass human sacrifice in Gaul : " Some of the tribes make colossal wickerwork figures , the limbs of which are filled with living men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish in a sea of flame . " No matter that burnt offerings on such a scale were only in times of crisis ? plague , famine , or invasion ? and the victims often criminals or prisoners of war . The Romans , having themselves given up human sacrifice ( though still massacring captive men , women , and children and reveling in blood sports ) , expressed shock . Beat Arnold , a young Swiss archeologist , was discussing that period as we stood overlooking Lake Neuchatel , the Bernese Alps rising snow crowned beyond , the wall of the Jura rising darkly at our backs . " We know of 258 prehistoric sites around this lake , " he told me . " It 's incredible what archeological treasures must lie under those waters ! " Arnold recently had retrieved an example : the best-preserved early Celtic ship  |p603  yet found . He pointed out the spot 70 yards offshore where he and his scuba-diving team had excavated the 60-foot , single-masted cargo vessel , preserving the pieces for reconstruction . Aerial photography had exposed its shadowy outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men bending their backs alongshore , big flat-bottomed barges like this , with large cargo capacity yet shallow draft , could negotiate the chain of rivers and lakes that funneled goods from the Mediterranean into the heart of Europe . La Tene commanded a strategic channel on that route ? where Neuchatel 's waters flow out northeastward toward the Rhine . Today it is a vacation camp , crowded with trailers and pleasure boats . But I could imagine it thronged with Celtic traders and bargemen , paying tolls to a Helvetian chieftain or making offerings to appease the temperamental gods of the waters . Three of Europe 's greatest rivers , flowing into three different seas , start near one another in the Celtic heartland . High in a Black Forest meadow I sipped from a German spring whose waters wend 1,776 miles to the Black Sea . A hundred paces from this fountainhead of the Danube lies the watershed of the Rhine , which ends its 820-mile course in the North Sea . At the foot of a Swiss glacier just 15 miles from the Rhine 's source I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles later warms its waters in the Mediterranean . Along these rivers I traced the trade routes and avenues of expansion of the Celts . And from one end of Europe to the other , I found exquisite Celtic art objects in that style named for La Tene . Art for the Celt was not on the fringe , but central to life , imparting both surface decoration and supernatural power to scabbard and ceramic as well as to brooch and bracelet . To 19th-century eyes that considered the classical " Apollo Belvedere " the paragon of art , this enigmatic , sinuous exuberance seemed outlandish . But with perceptions conditioned by 20th-century Matisse and Picasso , I found it fresh and fascinating . " That 's what makes Celtic archeology so exciting . Celtic art is abstract art , much like modern art . It speaks forcefully to us today . " Dr. Miklos Szabo , in the forefront of East European scholars working to make known the Celtic heritage of the Carpathian Basin ,  |p606  was talking with me in the Fine Arts Museum in Budapest , Hungary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , the natural and the supernatural . Little wonder it is ambivalent , " Dr. Szabo continued . " Janiform sculptures from Britain to Hungary symbolize this : two-headed gods looking in opposite directions , ruling over life both here and now and beyond the grave . Celtic art like Celtic sagas and folklore ? transcends the bounds between reality and fantasy . " We find the same motifs engraved on Celtic chieftains ' sword scabbards in Hungary , Switzerland , Yugoslavia , and Britain , " Dr. Szabo went on . In fact , similar motifs can be found in the exquisite filigree on Ireland 's eighth-century Tara brooch and Ardagh chalice , in the illuminated pages of the ninthcentury Book of Kells ( page 620 ) , and in sculptured tenth-century high crosses ? an amazing continuity of art style . In the sixth century B.C. the Scythians , nomads from the Russian steppes , invaded central Europe . A Scythian-type culture had long flourished on the Great Hungarian Plain , Dr. Szabo reminded me . " Trade diffused steppe traits westward , thus influencing Celtic art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reflected on the Celts ' debt to the steppe cultures . These gave more than just stylized animals in consummate gold craftsmanship . They gave that animal central to Celtic heroic society ? the war-horse . With it came distinctive bronze bits and harness trappings ? even the horseman 's trousers , the bracae , or breeches , that startled Roman eyes . And the head-hunting that made Roman hair stand on end . The Scythians fashioned skulls of foes into cups and drank from them . Chieftains lined such trophies with gold ? as would the Gauls . They gilded the skull of a Roman consul whose army they had destroyed and used it for libations at a shrine , " as their custom is , " reports the Roman annalist Livy . Wagon burials of Hallstatt chieftains were an eastern trait ; also the art of fighting on horseback . Spirited horses on Hungary 's pusztas , or plains , today echo the hoofbeats of the famed Gallic cavalry . A warrior 's horse was his badge of nobility ; commoners fought on foot . In rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Celtic knight foreshadowed the feudal knight in the Age of Chivalry ( itself named from cheval , French for " horse " ) . Horses were in the Celts ' blood . In their religion too . Epona , the horse goddess , is represented more widely than any other Celtic deity . At racetracks today Celts still seem to worship the horse . Looping south and then eastward , the Danube cuts through the Carpathians . The name of that passage ? the Iron Gate ? and the belching smokestacks and rising slag heaps of Bulgaria recall Balkan gifts to Celtic metallurgy . Here , even as early as in Asia Minor ( traditionally honored as the sole cradle of the metallurgical revolution that heralded the Bronze and Iron Ages ) , people long skilled in mining and smelting local copper alloyed it with imported tin to " subtly mold the breathing bronze " 3,500 years before Vergil cast that line . Balkan metal-founding techniques , spreading westward , underpinned Celtic technology . And astonishing Thracian gold masterworks , rich in animal motifs and symbolic ornamentation , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to document another source of Celtic inspiration . This links Celtic art with the ancient Near Eastern art tradition , as well as with later Persian influence resulting from Darius the Great 's conquest of Thrace in 513 B.C. ? two decades before the Athenians defeated his army at Marathon . Eastern influence shows in the embossed silver Gundestrup caldron , that marvelous melange of mythic beasts , gods , and heroes in sacrificial rites ( pages 582-3 and 612-13 ) . Found in a Danish peat bog , it was created perhaps by Danubian Celtic artists at Singidunum , today Belgrade . Following the Danube across the Romanian plain , I came to where the river decants its sediments ? 80 million tons a year ? in a vast and marshy delta and flows through a triad of mouths into the Black Sea . By that sea an ancient city stands open to the sky . Strolling Histria 's empty streets and plazas , I seemed to hear voices : the ghosts of history telling of its founding by Greek merchants 26 centuries ago . Of its trade with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p607  active corridor . Telling of Alexander the Great . In 335 B.C. Alexander marched north from Macedon in his Danubian campaign against the Getae . Defeating them and burning their capital , he recrossed the river to his camp . There Celtic envoys arrived from the Adriatic ? " people of great stature and haughty disposition , " wrote the Greek historian Arrian . Knowing of the Celts ' valor , Alexander asked what Celts feared above all else . That the sky might fall on their heads , came their reply . Boastful chaps , muttered Alexander . He had expected they would fear him most . ' ESS THAN THREE centuries later , the sky did fall on their heads . When Julius Caesar catapulted to fame and power over the bleeding corpse of Gaul , it was the beginning of the end for Celtic hegemony across the Continent . What triggered it was the migration of the Helvetii from their cramped homeland around Lake Neuchatel . Heeding some Celtic Horace Greeley , the Swiss tribe in assembly decided to go west to seek broader lands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough fashion , producing surplus crops for two seasons for their journey , rounding up cattle , building wagons by the hundreds , burning their 12 oppida , or fortified settlements , 400 villages , and thousands of homesteads to strengthen their resolve not to look back . To the Romans this migration posed a threat : Dislocation of tribes in Gallia Comata ( Long-haired Gaul ) might put pressure on Rome 's Mediterranean coastal province , her link with Spain . To Caesar , new proconsul of that province , it was a golden opportunity . He hurried north to block the passage between the Alps and the Jura where the Rhone leaves the Lake of Geneva . When the Helvetii slipped through a gorge , his legions pursued them into free Gaul , savagely massacred them , sent the remnants reeling back to pick up their lives anew amid the stubble of their scorched farms . A census on the eve of departure tallied 368,000 Helvetii and allies . Caesar reports that 110,000 got back . Caesar now proceeded , in eight years of campaigns , to " pacify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The self-styled savior of Rome fought some 30 battles , took more than 800 towns , killed by his own count 1,192,000 men , women , and children .

The " Gallic wall " of Gergovia , capital of the Arverni in the Auvergne , repulsed Caesar . And only Herculean engineering feats enabled him to breach that at Avaricum ( today Bourges ) and slaughter the 40,000 habitants within . This was in the crucial year of 52 B.C. , when Gaul at last rallied behind a young Arvernian chief , Vercingetorix .

Fight guerrilla warfare to cut off Caesar 's supplies and reinforcements . Avoid pitched battles in which the fiercely independent Gauls , incapable of sustained combined actions , would stake everything on a single impulsive throw , lusting for glory ? whether in victory or defeat . But the Celtic cards were stacked against Vercingetorix . Many Gauls made the sacrifices he called for . Some could n't . Others would n't . And when initial successes were followed by disasters , he withdrew with 80,000 Gauls to the oppidum of Alesia , " rocky hill " in Celtic . Along the hedgerowed and forest-browed border of the Burgundy wine country I drove northeastward from Bibracte , where an assembly of Gallic tribes , clashing spears on shields , had acclaimed Vercingetorix their leader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of hills , bracketed north and south by rivers .

Just before the ring closed , he slipped his cavalry out by night to summon relief from tribes far and wide . Now Caesar 's position grew critical .

But what emerged from the medieval crucible was not a Germanic culture but one sufficiently Gallic to provide the many survivals so wittily played upon by the creators of Asterix the Gaul ( pages 632-3 ) . THE BIGGEST nonevent in Irish history is that the Romans never got here , " my companion was saying . " Nor the Saxons . So we remained Celtic . We kept our peculiar patterns of society and customs , our Celtic approach to life . " Making a swing round the Celtic fringe of Eurasia , I had arrived in Galway , in western Ireland , where " the next parish is Boston . " Etienne Rynne joined me for a drop in the King 's Head after lecturing on Celtic archeology at the university ? a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ideas battling for place of honor on his tongue . " Our disunity saved us , " Etienne went on . " When the Vikings stormed ashore , there was no central government to conquer , and no towns . So the Vikings built their own ? Dublin , Cork , Limerick ? and lived apart . " Then the Anglo-Normans came . They built castles but could n't conquer the country either . It 's hard to , with 150 kings . You kill one , and his brother , ten miles away , takes over the chieftainship and starts up again . The result ? For hundreds of years there were two Irelands : Gaelic Ireland in the countryside , Anglo-Norman in the towns . The old Celtic society persisted down to the 17th century . Mountjoy and Cromwell destroyed it with scorched earth , removal of Irish to Hell or Connaught , ' and the planting of Protestant Scots and English in Leinster and Ulster . "  |p621  This was followed by the potato famine of : he 1840 's , which halved Ireland 's Gaelicspeaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland was equally tragic . It was mortally wounded in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 . After the Highlanders ' defeat at Culloden , the clan system was broken up , the bagpipe banned as an instrument of war , and the kilt outlawed . Then the infamous Highland Clearances replaced men with sheep and hunting ranges for gentlemen 's sport whence so many Gaelic speakers in Nova Scotia ( New Scotland ) . In Scotland today the old culture clings only in the western Highlands and islands . As in the Gaeltacht , the Gaelic-speaking west of Ireland . " Anything you recognize as Celtic in 20thcentury Ireland ? " I asked Etienne , putting a listening ear on myself as the bartender splashed another round into our glasses . " A lot . The folklore . The pagan survivals . The fairies , or good people . Some will say ' I do n't believe in them ' ? but they 're there ! Until recently there was fear of the power of curses , of second sight , of changelings ? that the fairies would substitute a sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected the cradle with fire tongs . Fire and iron are potent magic , and if you lay the tongs in the form of a cross ? well , that 's taking no chances and hedging your bets . " People still kill a sheep or a cock and sprinkle the blood on the threshold and the four corners of the house . Then they make the sign of the Cross with it on the forehead of each person in the house . This takes place on St. Martin 's Eve , November 10 , but one could hardly call it Christian . Nor must any wheel turn on St. Martin 's Day . The rite of wheel turning goes back at least to pagan Celtic times ? as can be seen on a sword scabbard from the Hallstatt cemetery or on the Gundestrup caldron . " The holy wells ? they 're very important . We have three thousand of them . Most are dedicated to saints now , but pagan rites linger . People still make sunwise circuits of wells ,  |p624  offering a pin or a coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cloth rots , the rheumatism , the eye problem , or whatever will be gone . " Some women make offerings for fertility , to overcome " the sterile curse . " The waters of one Cornish well , however , were reputedly contraceptive . Another gave mastery in marriage to whichever partner drank first . ( One newlywed dashed there , a ballad tells us , only to find his bride had taken a bottle of the water to the church ! ) " Note the way we count , " Etienne plunged on . " Go outside here to the Saturday-morning market , and you buy eggs by the score or the half score . An 80-year-old man is ceithre fichid ? four twenties ? just as the French say quatre-vingt . Ancient Celts counted in twenties . And they reckoned time by nights . Our fortnight , remember , is 14 nights . " The Irish calendar is yet another Celtic continuity . Our spring , for example , begins not on March 21 but on February 1 . The Celtic festival marking it , Imbolc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced a Celtic goddess , and nuns guarded a vestal fire at her shrine well into the Middle Ages . You 'll see her rush crosses , a swastikalike design  |p625  Heroes rule the pages of Irish legend . Like such epics as Beowulf and the Iliad , Celtic tales also teem with feats of bravery and strength . Though not transcribed until the Middle Ages , Irish heroic literature goes back to the oral traditions of pagan Celts . Overgrown with exaggeration , the tales manage nonetheless to give a valuable glimpse of early Celtic life-style . The superhero of the Ulster tales is Cu Chulainn , who demonstrates his prowess when he woos the woman Emer . Leaping into a fort , the young warrior kills the father and strikes down groups of men in single strokes . Then grabbing his love and her foster sister , he vaults the walls , carrying their weight in silver and gold as well ( left ) . Magic also appears in legends .

Cormac , a scholarly ninth-century king-bishop of Cashel , describes the Druids as having also done this . " Halloween . That was the eve of Samhain , the great festival on November 1 signaling the end of the grazing season and the start of the Celtic new year . All fires were put out and relighted , and according to the Dinnshenchas , a medieval collection of " the lore of prominent places , " firstborn children were sacrificed before a great idol to ensure fertility of cattle and crops .

Behind the masks and mischief , the jack-o ' - lanterns and food offerings , lurk the fear of malevolent spirits and the rites to propitiate them . " Take our sagas , " Etienne continued . " They 're Europe 's oldest vernacular literature after the Greek and Latin and are said to open a window on the Iron Age . ' The Irishman today can still recognize himself in them . We 're still often considered drunk with words . We love to exaggerate , to boast , to argue , to show off , much as did the ancient Celts . " No English understatement for us . Our turn of phrase , sense of humor , attitude to law and order are quite different . We wo n't wait at a red light if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishman rarely does , a German never . To them , the law is the law , sacrosanct . To us , the law is there ? but . The mentality is different . " I thought of the Le Goarnic family 's 20-year fight for the right to give Breton names to their children , denied legal existence under Napoleonic law . Of outlawed plaques with the Breton symbol for Brittany on so many cars in Brest . And of riding with a professor in Rennes . He turned into a one-way street . " It is forbidden to enter , " he said , pausing at the sign pointing the opposite direction . " Voila , we shall ascend the forbidden street . " Peter Harbison , an energetic archeologist with a boyish shock of hair as unruly as the old Irish , had told me what an Irish stationmaster had said when a German visitor took him to task for not synchronizing the clocks at either end of the platform . " And why would I be wanting two clocks if they both told the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's nothing we enjoy more than a good free-forall , " confessed Etienne . " Look at the traditional stick-and-ball games of the Irish and the English : hurling and cricket . One is among the fastest and roughest stick games in the world , while the other must surely be the slowest and most genteel . And hurling has a 2,000-year Celtic ancestry . " Controversy is a Celtic trait even older . To this day the Irish always seem to be running to court . Indeed , that instinct to litigate initiated the wave of Celtic piety , learning , and artistry that revitalized medieval Europe ? the upshot , tradition relates , of history 's first copyright case . St. Columba , borrowing a precious psalter , copied it in secret . Angrily claiming the copy , the owner went before the king of Tara , who judged : " To every cow belongs her calf , to every book its copy .

I had visited the holy isle of Iona , where Macbeth and murdered Duncan rest in its graveyard of kings . And in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin I had seen the Psalter of St. Columba . I even turned those precious vellum pages , studying the initials with their spirals , scrolls , pointed ovals , and animal heads . Restrained , these Celtic motifs , but bearing the seed that would burst forth in decorative intoxication in the Book of Kells , created by a later generation of Columba 's monks , perhaps at his monastery on Iona .  |p627  ' ay street .

But then the Irish often lace their holy water with irreverent spirits . Asked why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald , Earl of Kildare , explained that he thought the archbishop was in it . Modern Celts can be very ascetic . They like their pilgrimages harsh ? such as climbing Croagh Patrick the last Sunday in July on bare , bleeding feet . The custom of going to the heights at this time is a survival from the pagan festival of Lughnasa , folklorist Make MacNeill explained to me . Ancient Celtic farmers , pinched by " Hungry July , " would ascend to await wonderworking Lugh , " The Shining One , " who overpowered a primitive earth god to win the harvest for his people . They also believed the land would only be fruitful if the king of Tara , ritually mated with a goddess personifying Ireland , remained virile , without blemish , and broke no taboos . The clergy claim that a three-day vigil on  |p629  a tiny island in Lough Derg in Donegal is the harshest penitential exercise in Christendom .

Then , in the morning , an awful thing . You get this beautiful smell of rashers from the priests ' house . Bacon and eggs ! And yourself still fasting all these three long days . " And yet they come by the thousands each year . Many return six , eight , ten times . They really enjoy self-inflicted punishment , as surely the old Celtic saints did .

How did he deal with a crofter 's blaming a withered potato crop or sick cattle on a neighbor 's evil eye , I asked Father Joseph Kearney at dinner of an evening .

This boomeranged if unjust but , if a widow 's curse , plagued the oppressor 's family down seven generations . With patience . A Celt from the region himself , he knows how many Celtic traditions Christianity has swallowed , and how much Celtic belief underlies common attitudes . The very day I arrived on Inishmaan , a woman died .

Soon we were off down the pitch-black path to the last house before the sea . We entered the back entrance and threaded the hallway into the room where the corpse sat propped up primly in bed , nightcapped and gloved , hands crossed . Candles softly lighted the crowded room ; the deceased must never be left in the dark or alone . Where was the carousing ? In County Clare I heard that some wakes went on a week . Here was no drinking , no singing , no amatory games to symbolize procreation to offset death , no dancing with the corpse to give the deceased a memorable send-off , grateful for " the party of her life .

No wailing , no rending of garments . Only the sob of the sea and the keening of gulls . Even in the storm-lashed Aran Islands , stronghold of Gaelic where English is spoken " mostly to pigs and to dogs , " old customs are falling to the steep mortality of the years . The 20th century had flown me to Inishmaan . An ancient curragh took me away . But not before Joe Lovett had said , " Irish luck to you , " and Father Kearney recited : May the road rise to meet you , May the wind be always at your back .

We met no redheaded woman on the way , no cross-eyed person , saw no black snail first thing that morning , so our start was auspicious . And there was as much blue in the sky as would make trousers for a man ? a sign of good weather . With more than passing interest , I watched my two boatmen fix holes in the curragh 's black-tarred canvas bottom , melting the tar with an open flame and pressing it over the holes with a smooth stone . Then they marched the bent boat over the mossy rocks , looking like some prehistoric beetle , and upended it sunwise in the surf .

I thought of St. Enda 's stern test of his monks ' sanctity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a curragh , pious tradition holds . If the water came in on them , it was a sign of some earthly stain , and I would chance no such trial . But Padraic simply whittled a stick , tore a patch of cloth from his shirttail to put over it , drove it into the hole , and we were off , the mournful creak of the tholepins reminding me that islanders not only ca n't swim , but fatalistically wo n't move to save anyone else from drowning ? the sea is claiming its own . But " we do only be drownded now and again , " men of Aran say , and I clutched what grain of comfort can be gleaned from the adage , " A man will not be drowned if he is to be hanged .

Between 500 and 800 , the Celtic Christian Church in Ireland took the form of monastic centers . The island still preserves the beehive huts and oratories used by the holy men . Most early monasteries passed into ruin after raids by Irish tribes and Vikings .
