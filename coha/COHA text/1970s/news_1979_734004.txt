txt The small band of whites that still monopolizes power in Rhodesia naturally prefers a gradualist , " moderate " solution to the country 's racial and political problems , which are more or less synonymous . It tends , however , to confuse moderation with resistance to the changes that are vital to a workable multiracial state . The whites of Rhodesia more resemble men walking the last mile than gradualists moving slowly but voluntarily on a new path . They show this in things both important and petty . The white leaders have insisted that their black colleagues in the current biracial transition regime accept a hyphenated new name for the former British colony . Instead of calling the independent successor nation Zimbabwe , as planned , after the impressive ruins left by a vanished 4frican civilization , they now want the official name to be " Zimbabwe-Rhodesia . " Clinging to the old name does not so much reflect respect for that eccentric empire builder , Cecil Rhodes , as an unhealthy nostalgia for white colonial privilege . More importantly , the whites insisted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them disproportionate power in the next parliament , also guarantee them even greater representation in cabinet and executive positions . So much for what is supposed to become a " black majority government . " The present , overwhelmingly white parliament has finally taken some overdue steps toward equality , but even here it hedges dangerously . The so-called Land Tenure Act , which reserved roughly half of Rhodesia for a quarter million whites and left the other half to more than six million blacks , has been repealed . And white schools are to be opened to black children . ? If the school reform had been straightforward , it would have wiped away one of the most important black grievances . In the past , a short-sighted Government not only pinched pennies on black elementary . schools but limited to 12 percent the number of blacks who could attend secondary schools . With the reform , however , has come a fee schedule at the formerly allwhite schools that may be too large for all but a handful of black children . And it is proposed that one public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " community " private school that could restrict black enrollment to preserve its " character . " Rhodesia 's white establishment persists with such equivocation in the face of a deepening now perhaps hopeless ? crisis . Indeed , many whites regard even such grudging change as too much . Given the white community 's obvious reluctance to yield even to the moderate blacks with whom it is allied , there is less reason to bemoan the failure so far of international efforts to arrange for the participation of still more demanding blacks . The British , who took the lead in this effort , see no foreseeable chance of " allparty " negotiations that would enlarge the governing coalition to include the leaders of the Patriotic Front and its formidable guerrilla forces . If the Front leaders , Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe , need to take a more reasonable position toward negotiation , Prime Minister Ian Smith and his white colleagues and constituency clearly need to move an even greater distance .                  @ @ @
