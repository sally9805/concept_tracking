" Our analysis will be entirely impartial , " said Lord Pearce , the retired British jurist , when the 20-member Pearce Commission ended its eight-week fact-finding mission in Rhodesia in March . The commission 's task was to determine whether or not Rhodesians favored an agreement worked out by Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and British Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home to end the seven-year-old dispute over independence . The agreement called for British recognition of Smith 's white-supremacist government and a snail's-pace apportionment of political power to Rhodesia 's 5,000,000 blacks . <P> Two weeks ago , the Pearce Commission turned its completed report over to Douglas-Home . Though it will not be officially released until the end of the month , the word is already out that the commission found that " the people of Rhodesia as a whole " reject the settlement , and that black Africans " massively reject " it . <P> The report 's conclusions constitute a rebuke to Smith , whose popularity among Rhodesia 's whites has been declining recently . Last week in Salisbury he called a press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter farce . " The findings also present a dilemma for Britain . Conceivably , Prime Minister Edward Heath could ignore the report and go ahead with the proposed settlement-thereby risking a violent reaction from Rhodesia 's black majority as well as a bitter parliamentary debate . The only alternative would be to go back to the drawing board in search of a new settlement .
