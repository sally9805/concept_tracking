txt                     @x txt The campaign for home rule suffered a severe setback today as Scotland gave only ambiguous approval to plans for limited selfgovernment and Wales overwhelmingly reiected them . Complete returns from yesterday 's referendums showed that 52 percent of the Scots who voted said yes and 48 percent said no . But the affirmative total fell well short of the requirement by Parliament that 40 percent of all registered voters must give their assent . Deep Regional Split Although the referendum gave the Scots their first chance to move toward self-government since the Act of Union of 1707 joining Scotland and England , one voter in three stayed home . Blustery weather may have discouraged some , but others seemed to think that the issue did nut matter . The tally in Scotland showed a deep regional split . The margin of victory for limited home rule , or devolution , was provided entirely by the heavily industrialized Strathclyde region centered on Glasgow and the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with large concentrations of Welsh speakers , decisively voted no . The national tally was 4 to 1 against devolution , effectively killing the idea of a Welsh assembly . It was unclear tonight whether the Government of Prime Minister James Callaghan would try to press ahead with the creation of a Scottish assembly , for which chambers have already been prepared in Edinburgh . The final decision rests with the House of Commons . Bruce Milian , the Scottish Secretary , said the Cabinet would " need time to consider the implications " of the vote . The results were a stinging political defeat for the Prime Minister . After decades of debate , he had committed his reluctant party to the cause of limited selfrule in the belief that in Scotland , at least , it was supported by a vast majority of the population . One commentator called it " the worst bloody nose for a British Government in generations . " By the same token , the results were a signal victory for Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party . It alone opposed the home-rule measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , the Tories won two English by-elections yesterday by larger margins than had been anticipated . Yet Another Question Mark Whatever the decision on the Edinburgh assembly , ) 0 years ' preoccupation with " the Scottish question , " including the studies of a blue-ribbon commission , hundreds of hours of deliberation by the House of Commons and the spending of hundreds of thousands of Jollars on the referendums , has produced yet another question mark . The final tally in the referendum in Scotland was : yes , 1,230,937 , or 52 percent ; no , 1,153,502 , or 48 percent . In Wales , the count was : yes , 243,048 , or 20 nercent ; no , 956,330 , or 80 percent . The outcome could affect the timing of the next general election . Mr. Callaghan wants to wait until the fall , when the memory of this winter 's strikes and slowdowns may have dimmed . But the loss of a vote of confidence growing out of the - limited self-rule issue could force him into an election as early as March 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to salvage a Scottish assembly out of today 's wreckage , if only because the Scottish National Party said tonight that its 12 Members of Parliament would withdraw their support from the Government if he did not . That could cause the fall of the Government and an immediate general election . Mr. Callaghan must now introduce a repeal order in the House of Commons setting aside the Scotland Act of 1978 . If he decides to press ahead with the assembly , he would then try to convince Labor Members of Parliament to vote against the repeal order and , in effect , force Scottish devolution . Backing of the Liberals On such a vote , the Government would probably have the backing of the Liberals and the Nationalists as well as the Ulster Unionists . But it would be threatened with the loss of 20 to 25 Labor votes , which might well prove fatal . " I guess he 's bound to have a crack at it , " said Ian Mikardo , a left-wing Labor M.P. , " but I do n't think he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against limited ? self-government , mounted largely by the Conservatives with some help from disSident Laborites , had a considerable impact on today 's results . Three months ago , polls showed support for limited selfgovernment in Scotland running at 60 percent . But the Tories managed to put across the idea that the proposed assem ? bly would be a waste of money and they argued persuasively that it would lead to the disintegration of the United Kingdom . In addition , the unpopularity of the Government appeared to have been reflected in the voting . At least , one analyst saw in the outcome an implicit condemnation of the reorganizations that have taken place in recent years in local government , education and other services .
