Like a dental patient who worries that one shot of Novocain will not get him through the drilling , international moneymen last week warily eyed the second dollar devaluation in 14 months , skeptical about how long its crisis-numbing effects would last . At week 's end the signs were discouraging . <P> In Washington , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns announced bravely , " As far as I 'm concerned , this is the last devaluation . " Many speculators clearly did not believe him . Bursts of late selling drove the dollar 's price down against the Swiss franc , Dutch guilder and Italian lira . Through Wednesday , the West German Bundesbank found enough buyers of dollars to unload some $950 million of the $6 billion in unwanted greenbacks that it had been forced to buy just before the devaluation , but on Friday it had to buy dollars again to support the price . <P> The free-market price of gold in London touched a historic high of $94 an ounce and closed at $85 , up 24% just since the devaluation and 119% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact only on miners , jewelers and industrial users of the metal , since the value of the dollar is no longer tied to gold . But as a barometer of speculative sentiment the gold market was clearly registering a landslide vote of no confidence in the dollar . The only major exchange market that was quiet throughout the week was Tokyo , where bids and offers for dollars were readily available at a fairly stable price of 265.5 yen . <P> New York 's Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. calculates that the latest devaluation has shaved an average 6.5% off the price of the greenback relative to the money of 14 major U.S. trading partners . Taking into account the December 1971 devaluation as well , the dollar is now worth an average 17.1% less against these currencies . The question is whether that decline will make U.S. exports cheap enough for foreign buyers , and imports expensive enough for American consumers , to bring U.S. international trade closer to balance - and whether the still nervous exchange markets will give the devaluation the necessary time to begin to work .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
