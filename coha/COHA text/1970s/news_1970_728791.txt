Mideast Stakes To the Editor : Now that 71 Senators have Warned the Soviet Union that the United States intends " to protect and defend its interests in the Middle East " ( news article , July 31 ) , it is appropriate that we set about to determine precisely what those interests are . In the critical area of balance of payments , the United States enjoys one major plus  --  Arab oil . Dr. Thomas Stauffer of Harvard , in a recent article on the subject , writes that " the net contribution of Middle East oil to the U.S. balance of payments compensates for approximately half of the over-all deficit incurred by the U.S. vis-a-vis the rest of the world . " And whether we like it or not , Western Europe and Japan will continue to depend on the Arab world for about 80 per cent of their needs for as long as anyone can reliably foresee . The financial impact of our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that private contributions to Israel by Americans totaled $600-800 million in 1967 alone . " This was possible in spite of the balance of payments difficulties of the U.S. because Israel enjoys privileged access to the U.S. money market ; its bonds are accorded exemption from the Interest-Equalization Tax , while the Internal Revenue Service still treats United Jewish Appeal solicitations as tax deductible , thus shifting mulch of the real financial burden onto the U.S. taxpayer . " ? It should be added that Israel has enjoyed since its inception the highest rate of U.S. foreign aid per capita of any country in the world . The economic issue , of course , is only one aspect of the broader question of American interests in the Middle East . The geopolitical ; moral , strategic and cultural points of view all need to be more fully examined . It is at once apparent , however , that the continued economic well-being of the United States and of our most vital allies is critically- dependent on our maintaining a viable relationship with the Arab ? world . JAMES KNOX HOLMAN Darien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba To the Editor : Most , people will be pleased to read of the reverses suffered by Fidel Castro . It is not uncommon in ordinary human affairs to derive satisfaction from the misfortunes of one 's friends , not to speak ot , enemies . In politics it is worse . The . situation , I suggest , calls for a turnabout  --  to regard the economic setbacks in Cuba in a different , more compassionate light and as the moment ? to modify our policy in favor ' of some mutual understanding . It is difficult to predict the future course of politics in ' Latin America . Given the enormous tensions , it is a fair assumption that many of its governments will veer toward a dictatorship of the right or the left . Neither contributes to stability , peace or economic progress . The excommunication of Cuba is an aggravating factor that would not be relieved with the defeat or ouster of Premier Castro . It is within the realm of possibility that the recent economic difficulties may lead to a reappraisal by Castro , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation between democracy and economic growth . The cadres that Cuba desperately needs in industry and elsewhere , whether of the old or new generation , can not operate without some mode of independent political expression , without freedom . Democracy can no longer be equated simply with the popular support for Castro , even by its own partisans . It is opportune to explore every possibility for a . rapprochement with Cuba ; to discard our obsession about Castro and the nightmare of imminent subversion of Latin America or that change is possible only by external pressure . Castro is a maverick , not a rigid ideologue . Perhaps he will be amenable to a situation in which Cuba will be ? dependent neither on Moscow nor Washington ; and orient its economy and politics to the Caribbean and Latin America of which it is a part , as we are . It is worth a. try . Cuba has shown its strength ; now it publicly displays its weakness . We showed our weakness at the Bay of Pigs . It is time to display our strength . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scolded To the Editor : Granted that President Nixon 's gaffe concerning the Manson trial was a serious , albeit human , mistake . Granted that his staff should have acted more quickly than they did to minimize the error . However , it seems to me that the media representatives at the press conference share a major portion of the responsibility for blowing a minor error out of all proportion . Why did not a single reporter there immediately ask the President if he actually meant to say what he did and if he wished to clarify his remarks ? Why was not Mr. Ziegler asked , immediately , the same - questions ? It is obvious that reporters were more eager for headlines that would embarrass the President than they were interested in fair play either for Mr. Nixon or for Manson . Again Mr. Agnew is proved right DAVID ERLE HUYLER Associate Professor of History State University College New Peitz , N. Y. , Aug. 6 , 1970 ? Remarks on Manson To the Editor : Speculation about the President 's remarks on the Manson case has thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( News analysis , " Impulsive Nixon Action " ; editorial , " Mr. Nixon 's Loose Talk , " Aug. 5 . ) These are , principally , that the President , a lawyer , " did not betray concern , plunging ahead to criticize Manson 's attorneys " and to call Manson himself guilty ; that Attorney General Mitchell " standing to his right , also registered ' no emotion " ; that fifteen minutes were allowed to pass before Mr. Ziegler 's clarification ; and that at no time has the President 's remark been retracted . There are additional facts : In the public ' mind " law and order , " one of . the Administration 's leitmotifs , is not so much an abstract concept as a crusade against racial minorities and , significantly , unconforming youth . The Administration 's legislative , program in this field , its record of prosecutions and its intelligence-gathering operations are products of an increasingly narrow definition of constitutional guarantees and are themselves attempts to institutionalize them . There can be no doubt that the middle American coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his remark with approval , and its reverence for due process and the like would be strained should a mistrial result or the state 's case be lost on appeal . Only one kind of conclusion really fits these facts : that the President 's statement , far from being an " impulsive remark " or " loose talk , " was a calculated political act , carefully orchestrated to permit maximum dissemination before a couple of weak clarifications put the professionals at ease , leaving the original remark intact . Mr. Nixon once again has confounded his critics and gone over their heads to the country . He has only echoed popular wisdom , and there can be no political liability in that . What is more , he has set the stage for a series of legal maneuvers around the trial which can only serve to shorten this country 's patience with due process itself . It can no longer suffice to judge the Administration 's actions by the conventional yardstick of Presidential politics , it is time we began to understand that the whole enterprise is being redefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to comprehend these actions we had better find out what the new goals are . ROBERT MANOFF New York , Aug. 5 , 1970 ? Incinerators ' Effect To the Editor : In a July 30 letter Abraham Engelman objected to any law requiring the upgrading of incinerators and oil burners in New York City and stated that the air pollution from such sources is insignificant . In addition to failing to disclose that he is an attorney for certain landlords who have failed for four years to comply with Local Law 14 , the city 's basic anti-air pollution statute , Mr. Engelman 's letter grossly misleads by minimizing the severe polluting effects of incinerators and oil burners . There are over 15,000 incinerators and 135,000 oil burners in New York City . The ' incinerators alone SECRETS Even when the talk is most earnest , my eyes will stray to where the children play ; and one among them , however avid the play , will turn his face and our eyes will meet . In such moment it is always three o'clock ; . . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , " the little hand on the three " ; and the room , *of a sudden , is empty ; there are only two arrows , one north , one east , and neither talk , nor play , will add to the wisdom we share ; this is our secret , and we smile , each to the other , the child and I , and we can not , now , or forever . return to the others . HENRY GILFOND contribute more than 35 per cent of the particulate ( i.e. ' soot ) pollution in the city . Oil burners alone contribute an ad-. ditional 35 per cent of the soot , 69 per cent of the sulphur dioxide and 44 per cent of theoxides of nitrogen in the city 's ' air . In total , incinerators and oil ' burners spew over 667,840 tons ( 1,335,680 pounds ) of noxious ' pollutants annually . Furthermore , as pollution which is closer to ' ground level than factory and Con Ed emissions , incinerator and oil burner pollution is even greater on the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw , percentages reflect . It is incontrovertible that ; these pollutants directly cause . people to die prematurely each : day . This air pollution-caused phenomenon bears the macabre , label of " excess deaths . " One . local scientist has even worked out a table which will show ? how many excess deaths there . will be on a given day based . on information with respect to , levels of pollutants like soot , and sulphur oxides on that day . Thus , abatement of this polln -- tion by the immediate upgrad : ing of incinerators and oil burners is a matter of actual life and death . We believe that when the issue is between human life arid dollars ( which , by the way , are in time more than 100 per cent recoverable by , landlords under various laws designed to provide an incentive to upgrade ) , human life should always prevail . We find the landlords ' longstanding intransigence on up- , grading based upon a desire to avoid an initial outlay of dollars , to be the rankest form of commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel to excuse this be havior by misstating the basic facts supporting our air polluton control laws to be beneath contempt . ROBERT J. KAFIN President ? Citizens for Clean Air , Inc . New York , Aug. 3 , 1970 ? Soviet Spy Ship To the Editor : What right does the Russian ' spy ship have to grab pieces of our test missiles off the Florida coast ? And why do n't we do something about it ? If the reverse happened to an American vessel off the Russian coast , the ship would be seized and the crew put in jail for piracy . A. E. LUDERS JR . Stamford , Conn. , Aug. 6 , 1970 ? Conversation Crutch To the Editor : The comma has been replaced ? almost , It has been dropped out of the conversations of thousands of people and replaced by " you know . " Just listen to television interviews , or the conversations of people whom you might expect to know better , and you will ? be distressed by the constant repetition of these two words . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know ! " How about a reform movement to clean up the careless use of such conversational crutches . CHARLES R. STIRES Amagansett , L.I. , July 29 , 1970
