In the program it is called the " Giant Gyrating Gyro-Wheel , " and that is probably as good a name as any for the contraption . Two or three times a day at Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden , where the Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey Circus has settled in for its spring visit , a British-born performer named Elvin Bale approaches the device , unlimbers its 40-ft. arms and sets both himself and the great wheel into motion . Thus begins what Ringling Impresario Irvin Feld says is " one of the most fantastic thrill acts the show has ever had . " <P> For once , circus hyperbole comes close to fact . At one end of the Gyro-Wheel 's arms is a heavy counterweight ; at the other is a circular wire-mesh cage 8 ft. in diameter . Bale and his wife Jeanette give the cage a mighty push . As it begins to turn , Bale hops inside , then makes like a hamster in an exercise wheel . As the cage rises , he runs up the inside to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpedals frantically to slow the whooshing descent , reversing again at the bottom to propel himself around the loop once more . <P> So far , so good . Cardiac-arrest time-the moment when some kids in the audience begin to chant " Fall ! Fall ! Fall ! " - comes when Bale climbs outside the cage and does the whole heart-stopping routine standing on top , with nothing between him and a nasty tumble but an exquisite sense of balance . As the cage dives earthward from the peak of its arc some 45 ft. in the air , he is in danger of being tossed by centrifugal force into the cheap seats . Bale often loses balance on the downswing and has to hang on for dear life . <P> Bale 's Gyro-Wheel act is not his only scary turn . At another point in the show , he dives headfirst off a swinging trapeze bar and then catches himself , at the last moment , by his heels . That stunt gives even Bale bad dreams . " The heel is the last point of your body , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fall . Sometimes I wake up at night dreaming I have just missed the bar . " On these occasions , adds Jeanette , " he almost knocks me out of bed , grabbing at things . " <P> Bale , 30 , is a fourth-generation circus performer : his great-grandfather was a juggler , grandpa had a bicycle act , and Dad Trevor Bale is an animal trainer . These comparatively tame pursuits never interested Elvin . Even as a child , says his father , " he was always hanging off things . " He was-and is-also always dreaming up new things to hang from : the Gyro-Wheel was inspired by a double Ferris wheel he saw in a carnival and the cage toy his son has for his pet hamster . As for his safety , Bale eschews nets but never forgets a cardinal rule : " If you start taking things for granted , you get hurt . It 's dangerous not to maintain an edge of fear .
