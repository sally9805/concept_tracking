While some of the key witnesses yet to appear before the Senate Watergate committee may well back John Mitchell 's story that President Nixon was long unaware of his aides ' involvement in the breakin , they are expected to implicate each other as well as Mitchell in the coverup . These witnesses include Herbert W. Kalmbach , H.R. Haldeman , John D. Ehrlichman and Gordon Strachan . Their testimony would leave the President with few wholly untarnished defenders in a position to know what the President might have known . <P> These witnesses have given advance testimony to the Senate committee 's staff . Haldeman and Ehrlichman testified at a time when Nixon was claiming that Executive privilege prevented them from relating discussions with him ; he has since waived that claim . Some of the points these men will make : <P> KALMBACH . Drawing on a surplus of $1.1 million from the 1968 Nixon campaign funds , Kalmbach ( see box following page ) began in mid-1969 to finance secret White House investigations . Directed by Haldeman and carried out by Special White House Investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the backgrounds of such " enemies " as Senator Edward Kennedy , New York Mayor John Lindsay , and House Speaker Carl Albert . <P> As new Nixon contributions came in , some of the money was secretly channeled into the 1970 campaigns of favored Republican candidates , including , ironically , the highly critical Watergate-committee member Lowell Weicker Jr . The money was held in a dummy organization called " the Public Institute , " which dispensed some $2.5 million . By 1971 Kalmbach was supplying funds to California Lawyer Donald Segretti , the White House-directed political sabotage agent . Kalmbach 's authority to pay Segretti came from Haldeman and Dwight Chapin , former White House appointments secretary . <P> At the suggestion of John Dean and with the approval of Ehrlichman , Kalmbach on June 29 of last year began raising money for the defense of the seven arrested Watergate burglars . By late in the year , the defendants had been paid $460,000 . Kalmbach used Ulasewicz for many of the hush-money deliveries ; the two conversed from public telephone booths and used code names ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hunt , " the Brush " for Haldeman ) . Kalmbach decided to pull out of this illegal activity and did so in September 1972 . <P> EHRLICHMAN . He will admit giving Kalmbach " perfunctory " approval to raise money for the defendants but say that he did so partly because " Mitchell had some interest in making sure that the defendants were well defended . " Ehrlichman will express suspicions , similar to those of Mitchell and Dean , that Colson had a role in pushing the Watergate wiretapping plans . But Ehrlichman will claim that he personally took no part in cover-up activities and kept urging that anyone involved " make a clean breast of it . " He was told that Mitchell " effectively threw blocks " at any such disclosure . Ehrlichman will also corroborate Dean 's testimony that Mitchell had reported that " blackmail " demands of Hunt had " been taken care of . "
