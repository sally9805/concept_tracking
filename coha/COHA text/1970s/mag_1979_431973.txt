 | Marvella Bern was born in Oklahoma on February 14 , 1933 . In 1951 , at a speech contest , Marvella met Birch Bayh of Indiana . They married a year later , had a son in 1955 , and in 1962 moved to Washington when Birch was elected to the U.S. Senate . Their joy was dimmed by Marvella 's frequent illnesses and her father 's drinking . A week after her mother 's death in 1964 , her father ran off with a woman two years younger than Marvella . In June of that same year , the Bayhs flew to Massachusetts with Senator Edward Kennedy . Enroute , their small plane crashed . Though injured , the Bayhs were able to crawl from the wreckage . In the dark , they called out to Ted . He did not answer .... The plane had crashed in an apple orchard . I crawled out the window over the torn wing and the dangling motor . Birch was behind me , still calling for Ted . There was a strong smell of gasoline . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a flashlight he had found in the plane and looked into 1 .  | what had been the cockpit ? where the pilot and Ted 's friend Ed Moss had been sitting . " My God , " Birch said . " We 've got to go for help . " The smell of gasoline was overpowering . " I ca n't leave Ted , " Birch said . " We must get him out . " We climbed back up onto the torn wing and looked into the hole through which we 'd escaped . The plane 's going to catch on fire , I thought . Our son , Evan , will be an orphan . With the flashlight we could see Ted lying on the floor . He was barely conscious . " My back , " he moaned .

Birch managed to get Ted out through the window . " You 've got to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out my arms . Ted 's feet hit , thud , on my arms , and went right through them . Birch pulled him over in the wet grass , far enough from the plane to escape the flames if they came . We covered him with my raincoat . " We 're going to get help , " Birch told him . We took the flashlight  | and walked ? I limping barefoot . A car slowed down . A woman , alone , rolled down her window a slight way but kept moving . A second car approached . The driver took us to his house , where we phoned for help . Then he drove us back to the plane . The pilot had been killed instantly , but Ed Moss was still breathing . They had to use crowbars to get Moss out . Ted was lifted into one ambulance , Moss into the other , with me on a stretcher beside him and Birch in front with the driver . Ed Moss died seven hours later . Ted 's back was broken . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feared he would n't live . He had no pulse and had to have three blood transfusions . Birch and I were both in pain ; I with coccygodynia ? hairline cracks in my coccyx ? Birch with torn muscles in his right hip and stomach . We were hospitalized for 10 days . Compared to Ted 's , our injuries were minor . Ted was in excruciating pain . His wife , Joan , had just lost her baby , and now she did n't know if Ted would ever walk again . How could I help her ? But it was she who helped me . Joan came to see me every day while she stayed with Ted . " You 're so far away from home , " she said , " let me be your family . " President Johnson sent two neurosurgeons from Walter Reed Hospital for Ted . Jackie and Bobby Kennedy came and Senator Mike Mansfield , the majority leader . My father did not call and I did not call him , although I ached to do so . They flew us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher because I could n't yet sit up . Evan met us at the airport . We tried to make life normal for Evan , but all I could think about was death . I hoped that plunging into the 1964 Democratic Convention would ease the memory of the accident and the pain at the loss of my mother and also take my mind off my father . Yet the harder I plunged , the worse my body seemed to feel . I was terrified that somebody would see how badly my hand was shaking . How could I let Birch down by falling apart now ? I vowed to control that shaking left hand at all costs . At the convention in Atlantic City , I dragged about , plagued by headaches and double vision , freezing my face into a smile . After the President nominated Senator Humphrey for Vice President , I slipped out of the Convention Hall and collapsed . The next day , my heart began to race at over 115 beats per minute . Birch drove me to the doctor who asked , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate my father , " I said , suddenly weeping . He made an appointment for me to see a good psychiatrist . It took three visits for me to spill out everything I had been trying to handle : the emptiness where my mother had been ; my feelings of guilt because she had sacrificed so much for me and I had not done enough for her ; anguish about my father ; the irrational fear of Birch getting into an airplane ; my feelings of inadequacy as I tried to improve myself ; my frustration at feeling sick all the time . The doctor 's voice was comforting as he explained that grief was at the base of my problems . " You are expecting too much of yourself ; you are trying to be everything to everybody . No wonder your body is in rebellion . " I continued to rush helter-skelter into the demands of a presidential-election year . Just after my insomnia began to improve , the phone calls from Oklahoma started . This time it was the neighbors complaining about Daddy 's drunken behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worried that my physical problems and publicity about my father might be a detriment to Birch 's career . I was so proud of Birch . I felt his political star was beginning to rise . The brightest event of 1965 was Teddy Kennedy 's return to Washington . He and Joan were coming to our house for dinner on January 31 . I wanted everything to be perfect . The party went well , even though changes of guests , back problems and a defective furnace nearly defeated me . In August , Joan and Ted invited us to join them for a weekend at Hyannis Port . I was thrilled . We returned from the Cape Cod weekend to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary . So much had been crammed into those 13 years ? college ... law school ... Evan ... eight years in the legislature ... already three years in the Senate . Birch had promised me a quiet date to celebrate . But instead there was a surprise party for me aboard the presidential yacht , the Sequoia . The party was President Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In April 1966 , I was invited to make a speech at Oklahoma State College . It would be my first trip home since Mother 's death . I stayed at my Aunt Lillian Thorp 's house in Enid . I took flowers to the cemetery . My father had had Mother 's grave moved 13 inches to the north , to make a space for his new wife . He had also ordered a new headstone , with both women 's pictures on it . It struck me as more than bizarre . Daddy came to see me . He was thicker around the middle , his eyes puffy . His wife was in Tennessee , he said . " To say I 'm sorry sounds like so little , but I am sorry , " he said . Seeing him standing there so meekly , with love in his eyes , was a comfort , but it was n't easy . The estrangement had taken a great toll on me . And yet , he was still my father . Despite everything , I loved him and felt sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but what had I accomplished ? In 1966 I was making speeches about the contributions of women to America , but I felt my own life lacked focus . I felt a need to make my own contribution . Birch and I had decided to build our own house in the District of Columbia . I was going over plans with the builder in January 1967 when Birch called . " The President wants to see us both at the White House , " he said . Lyndon Johnson quickly got down to business . He turned to Birch . " I want your wife to be vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee . " I went numb . He went on , looking at me ? " You 'd be your own boss . If Evan has the measles , you can stay home . You 'd have a staff and an office ? and a good salary so you can buy pretty clothes and travel all around .... " We said we 'd think it over and left , speechless . I wanted that job more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sure . The big decision was not what was right for Marvella , but how this would affect his 1968 Senate campaign . His staff people said it would be " very unwise politics " for me to be on the payroll of the DNC , for me to be publicly that close to the President . I remember walking the floor and crying as they talked . This had been like offering candy to a starving baby . A top position , with a staff and big salary , would be heady stuff to anybody . Put that offer in the Oval Office of the White House and have the President of the United States look at you and say , " I need you . " It was the culmination of my dreams ? the beginning of that career of my own I had been postponing for so long . Birch never told me , " You ca n't take this job . " He knew better than that . But the advisers talked on . It was implied that if he ran and lost , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Friday the 13th of January 1967 , we walked into the President 's office . " Mr. President , I need her in Indiana , " Birch said and spelled out his reasons why . " Well , of course I understand , " President Johnson said . As we drove out the White House gates , Birch took my hand . " I know how much you wanted that job . I 'll never forget what you gave up for me . " I could n't answer . There was no voice in my throat . He said in later years that it was the worst mistake he had ever made . That same January 1967 , Daddy was in the hospital . He and his wife had been on a week-long binge , without eating . I went home to Oklahoma . Daddy 's face was gray and bloated , beard-stubbled and stained . He stammered out his despair about money . " My nerves , my nerves . I can not stand it , " he cried . I had never seen anybody in that condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . I begged him to stop drinking , but he did n't even hear me . I caught a plane and left in despair .  | We had to gear up for Birch 's Senate campaign . During the campaign my next-door neighbor had a terrifying dream . She stayed awake watching TV until she was sure Bobby Kennedy had won in California . Then she dreamed that Birch Bayh was shot twice in the head . Of course , it was Bob Kennedy who had peen shot twice in the head , and died the next day . How could the Kennedys hear all this ? The horror was almost too much to comprehend . My emotions tumbled together into a hard knot of anger at the violence in our society . In the 1968 Senate campaign , Birch and I had our own schedules and did not see each other very often . But we talked every day on the phone . In one of those phone talks , Birch said , " Where are you ? " " At the Airport Holiday Inn in Indianapolis . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am at the Airport Hilton , - ight across the street . " We were there to speak - efore different groups . The staff had booked us into different hotels . On election day , Birch took me in his arms and said , " God has been good to us since we met each Cher . Win or lose , it will -e fine . " The day seemed t hours long . Birch was the only Dem.rat to win statewide in Indiana . Nixon carried the : rate by 256,000 votes . What really rankled me after the election was that Birch did n't take my part when there was a conflict between me and a member of his staff . I 'd be in tears and Birch would say , " Oh , it must have been your fault . " I felt so ill-used and hurt , I could hardly bring myself to call the office . My gynecologist , Dr. Stafford Hawken , told me that I needed a hysterectomy . I was out of commission for four weeks early in 1969 , but after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years of estrogen had been artificially running a naturally defective machine . Now , at 36 , a new burst of physical well-being gave me the impetus to really get on with my life ? to get on with Birch 's life , that is . The plans that Birch and his backers were setting in motion all assumed Ted Kennedy would be the presidential nominee in 1972 . In July 1969 , however , tragedy touched Ted once again ? Chap-@# paquiddick . My heart went out to Joan ? that warm , buoyant , loving young wornan , concerned about her husband 's health , expecting another child . How could she stand all of this ? ince Ted would not be a candidate , 1970 began with planning sessions in earnest on Birch 's presidential effort . Our first trip , in January , took us to Oklahoma City . I looked over the crowd for Daddy , who had promised to meet me , but he was n't there ? his wife had run off with the car . I flew to Enid to see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the phone . In the background I could hear him staggering around . He spoke a few words to me in a voice so thick-tongued l could barely understand him . But he would n't see me . Then a letter arrived in Washington from my Uncle Otis : Daddy 's wife had filed for divorce . On Easter Sunday morning 1970 , Birch and I were in Monaco for a conference . Alas , the next day , Birch was called back to Washington . I could have cried , but I decided to remain with the delegation . , That afternoon at a tea , Senator Sparkman of Alabama had me called outside the room . He and Mrs. Sparkman stood there , tears in their eyes . " Marvella , get your coat and come , " he said , taking my arm . " Your father shot your mother and then shot himself . They are both dead . " I began to tremble . " She 's not my mother , " I said weakly . The Sparkmans were tender , sympathetic . " Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Sparkman advised me . " Forget the recent one . "  | I flew home . Birch went with me to Oklahoma . By the time we arrived , I had a high fever . We went to the house . Somebody had tried to wash the blood off the carpet , but it was there , my daddy 's and that of the woman he had married . Even now I see the size of it , the shape . The body in the funeral home looked waxen , but this , this was my father 's blood . I spoke at my father 's funeral that old April day , when the heavens poured rain into the red Oklahoma earth . I told of the daddy I had known , my pal , often the only father at the school plays , a man who gave people a chance , who told his grandson about nature . I went back to Washington . I was very shaky . My father 's death was a far greater blow than I could possibly tell anyone . If only there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted , to adjust , to be calm . I woke up screaming the night of June 1 . I 'd dreamed that Birch had committed suicide . By mid-October we were full steam on Birch 's campaign for President and I was back to square one . A racing heart . Tranquilizers to sleep . A basketful of tension all day long . Dreaming about Daddy , I would wake up sobbing . I needed new clothes for the campaign . While on a shopping trip to New York on my 38th birthday , my right breast began to hurt . It was February 18 , 1971 . The X-ray was okay ; the physical exam showed no lump . I was vastly relieved . Birch was away , speaking in Texas . I was home , feeling dizzy and a little disoriented . I continued feeling awful . Back to the doctor . Low blood pressure . Biz shots . Speeches ahead , traveling all spring and summer . Birch would announce his candidacy for President in the fall . From my point of view , the campaign was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office staff , infighting , Birch exhausted . And when he walked in the front door , he began to growl . Birch called a staff meeting in the basement of our home to talk about his campaign debt . He did n't want me to attend . That was the lowest point . I had made his career my career and now I was shut out ? excluded in my own home . My bitterness was beyond description . I felt our marriage was deeply in trouble . For the first time , I considered leaving Birch . And I believe he felt the same way . It was a test of the strength of our marriage that we survived it all . On September 23 , Birch took off for Florida . My right breast felt swollen again . Now , there was an occasional zip of pain , like a small electric shock . The mammogram was okay , the doctor told me . There was no lump he could feel . But he wanted a biopsy . The night before the biopsy Birch flew back from Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I get out of here all right , " I promised , " I 'll  | help you in the campaign ? in any way that I can . " " Everything 's going to be all right , " he said . " I just know it . " I had breast cancer . I could not believe it . I was that cold statistic : one out of every 13 American women . When the doctor said , " It 's malignant . We 'll have to remove the breast , " I went into shock , my chin trembling out of control . " Bad news . Bad news , " I cried out , over and over again . " I 'm only 38 years old . I do n't want to die . " And then , with wrenching fear , I thought about Evan , mischievous , 15-year-old Evan . " I have the most wonderful boy .... " I cried . It did n't occur to me then to worry about losing a breast . I was afraid of cancer . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a modified radical mastectomy . Surgeons removed my right breast , a portion of the chest muscle and the lymph glands in the armpit . It took two hours . Four days after surgery , it hit . Even with shots , sedatives and sleeping pills , I stayed awake all night , wrestling with the fear of mutilation and death . Why had this happened to me ? I rolled over , faced the wall and cried . All I could think of was that I wanted my mother . The next evening , I was watching television . There was my husband on the evening news , speaking at a press conference . " Whenever I have had an important decision to make , my wife , Marvella , has always been there . But Marvella is not here today . She is not here because she underwent critical surgery for a malignancy . " We have every reason to believe the operation was a success , " he went on in a choked voice . " However , her complete recovery may require a lengthy period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her side . Therefore , I am not a candidate for the Presidency . " I lay there , tears streaming down my race , feeling more pain for my husband than in the wound in my chest . @# As my scars healed and the chemotherapy took its effect , the wounds in our marriage began to heal as well . From Birch came my greatest support , my will to fight . " We 're going to lick this thing , " he kept repeating . That first , hard question , " Why me ? " spun through my head as I searched back . Did DDT cause my cancer ? sprayed in white clouds of poison over my father 's wheat field ? Could it have been the weeks of radiation when I was 11 , recovering from pneumonia ? Was it the years of artificial sweeteners to help control my weight ? For years I had relied on estrogen to regulate my cycles . Had that caused my cancer ? I asked Dr. Hawken all those questions . " What has caused this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer , " he replied . I had cried out to Birch , " How am I going to go through the rest of my life with only one breast ? " And he had answered , causing me to laugh until tears came , " Well , I 've made it all right through 43 years without even one ! " But then he said , " Do you think I married you for your breasts ? I married you for you . " He will never be able to comprehend how much that statement meant to me at that time . We spent my 40th birthday in New York , and I had only four more chemotherapy injections to go . But I was already exercising my new lease on life . Then I took on a mission . The American Cancer Society had asked me , along with actor Peter Graves , to serve as national cochairman for the 1974 Cancer Crusade . In 1974 , Birch was up for re-election to the Senate . The Republicans were wheeling out their big guns . He had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had needed him . I would help him now because he had asked me . Evan , who was graduating from high school , would work in the campaign in the summer , then enter the University of Indiana in the fall . On September 27 , I saw First Lady Betty Ford at the groundbreaking for the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Park . I thought she looked tired and drawn . That evening she was in the hospital for a biopsy . On Saturday , she had a radical mastectomy . Suddenly , with the First Lady 's mastectomy in front-page headlines , I was called for a spate of interviews about breast cancer . After Birch 's reelection , I was hired by television station WRC to be the " Bicentennial Reporter , " to interview officials and historians every Sunday morning until July 4 , 1976 . I would be Marvella Bayh , not " Mrs. Birch Bayh . " That same fall , the American Cancer Society hired me as a consultant and special representative . It was the job of a lifetime for me ? especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cancer had sent them to the doctor and saved their lives . In November , the entire Democratic state ticket was elected . Our first day home ( only Birch 's third since Labor Day ) , I wrote in my diary : " I want to walk through the leaves with Birch . I want him to play his guitar and sing love songs to me . I want him to have the time and energy to feel deeply and write moving poems . I want to love . " In the spring of 1975 , I begged Birch not to enter the presidential race . I feared an assassination attempt and the toll on our family life of another campaign . Moreover , if he ran or were elected , I worried that I 'd have to give up my work with the American Cancer Society . That summer , with my own salary , I  | made a down payment on a vacation cabin in Virginia overlooking the Shenandoah River . We worked together to make the house livable ? physical work that brought us surprising happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the river . I painted woodwork , furniture . Living there was like discovering two old selves . It was in the country , with peace of mind for thinking , that I realized that in opposing Birch 's candidacy for the Presidency , I was imposing the same kind of burden on him that he had imposed on me in rejecting President Johnson 's offer . It was his life , his career , his decision . I could never forgive myself if I stood in his way . But I would not campaign for him . Birch understood . His pride in my independence was considerable . On October 21 , 1975 , he announced his candidacy . But it was not to be , and on March 4 , 1976 , he formally withdrew after 4 ? months of an honest swing at bat . Our 25th year together saw a marriage between equals ? between two people who are mature and happy , each secure in his life-style , each making his own contribution . It is amazing that we came through the hurricane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sitting on top of the world . I called Birch . " I am about to explode , " I said . " Why ? " he asked . " I am so happy . " Birch got that little catch in his throat . " I am so happy that you are happy , " he said . I had an appointment for my threetimes-a-year cancer checkup . I was not too worried . After all , it had been 61 years , with " all clear " tests . That afternoon , January 25 , 1978 , I did n't get an " all clear . " The doctor found a lump on the left side of my neck ? flat , hard , about the size of my little fingernail ? a swollen lymph node . Only then did I learn things about my previous breast cancer . I had thought only two lymph nodes were involved . Now I was told there had been five . And two ? not one ? types of cancer had been found in that right breast ; one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast and even into the skin . The node on my neck was malignant , the same type of cancer that had invaded my breast . During the next three days I underwent liver scans , X-rays of the lungs , bone scans . The results were not yet in when we gave the first of two dinner parties for 50 to celebrate our birthdays . It was a merciful diversion . The news was bad . The cancer had spread to my bones . Birch and I held each other and we cried . It could not be real . I felt so well . I looked so well ? how could it be in me ? The chemotherapy was supposed to stop this . " Where is God 's love ? " I asked my neighbor Jane Suydam who is a bornagain Christian . " Tell me about God 's love . " " There are miracles , " she said softly . " They do happen . " She read the 23rd Psalm to Birch and me . I asked for the faith to believe , to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and in my taut body . It was as though a path were being opened for me . I took my first steps along that path that night by saying , " I want to believe . " Dr. George Blumenschein of M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston , Texas , flew up to consult with the Washington cancer doctor , Birch and me . He talked about " buying time " with a new , hard drug that would have heavy side effects while we waited for even newer drugs to appear . " Live one day at a time , " Dr. Blumenschein said . That night I turned again to prayer . I read the booklets Jane Suydam had given me , stories of miraculous healings , lessons on how to pray , how to receive God 's blessing . I felt myself growing spiritually , more than I had grown in the last 25 years . We were back at the White House once again , on my birthday , for a reception for the Finance Committee of the Democratic Party and a movie afterward with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer filled me with memories . We went downstairs to the theater where we had watched a movie with the Kennedys when we were so young and excited about Washington . Once , I had wondered if I would live in this house ; now , I only hoped to live . The Carters were warm and friendly . I thanked the President for his prayers ? and told him I would like to meet his sister Ruth . The doctors had told me that I had " stage four " cancer , which is the last stage . " The prognosis is not bright , " they had said . Evan came home in March . That month 's worth of prayer had given me the courage to tell him . I told him how much prayer had helped me . " It 's been helping me too , " he said . " I 've been attending a prayer group at school . " Birch was supportive in so many ways . He learned to bake bread . He attempted a pecan pie . When I flew to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his telegrams : " HAVE A GREAT DAY IN THE BIG APPLE , BUT BEWARE OF THOSE BIG CITY BOYS . REMEMBER I LOVE YOU . " I searched around the country and among a number of doctors for the therapy I needed . God works through medical science , through doctors , I believe . Throughout that long ordeal I , who had always been a bundle of nerves , needed no tranquilizers , no sleeping pills . That was the miracle faith had given me . I had been reading a book , The Power To Heal , by Father Francis MacNutt , a Catholic priest whose ministry has been in healing through prayer . That book had given me such a lift that I went to meet Father MacNutt . A giant of a man , Father MacNutt spoke in the softest , most gentle voice that I had ever heard . He prayed for healing ? first in English and then in what they call " Tongues , " beautiful , unintelligible ( to me ) sounds that are , they say , inspired by God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice what he called " soaking " prayer , continuing , quiet but intense prayer every day . I prayed that the soaking prayer would help the medicine I was taking to work upon the cancer in my body . Easter Sunday in our Virginia cabin was a quiet time for Birch and me , highlighted by a visit to church and listening to religious tapes . That afternoon Birch went outside to get a load of firewood . When he came back in , he said , " The power to live is so strong that the tulip bulbs are sprouting right through the hard , icy crust . " Birch appeared unexpectedly at Georgetown University Hospital on April 3 , as I checked in for my new bone scans . From the results ; it appeared that the prayers and pills were working , and I rejoiced . The previous Sunday , Birch and I had watched a television program new to us , Reverend Robert Schuller 's Hour of Power , from Garden Grove , Calif . Later Reverend Schuller came to my house for talk and prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his television program . I finally accepted Reverend Schuller 's invitation . I would pray for God to give me the right words , to be a witness in a way that would give comfort and not confusion to others . It was a glorious spring . I was energetic , free from anxiety and pain , immersing myself in prayer and hope . My blood tests showed no further progression . On a trip to California with Birch , I was reading on the plane . He reached over , took my bookmark from my hand , and wrote : " Thank you for loving me for more than a quarter of a century . P.S. I am looking forward to the next 25 years ! ! ! At least . " And signed it with his usual heart and arrow . In May , we watched Evan graduate from college , a milestone in our lives . And , also in May , my faith was tested again . The U.S. Postal Service was publishing a commemorative stamp to honor the work of Dr. George Nicholas Papanicolaou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uterine cancer . On May 18 , there was to be a Pap stamp ceremony in the East Room of the White House . Mrs. Carter and I were to speak . Just as I was leaving home , my new cancer doctor called with the result of my latest blood test , the one that since February had been encouraging . Today he had bad news : on the diagnostic scale , my previous test had read 3.5 , well below the " clinical level " of 5 . Now , this one read 10 ? tumor activity , which he interpreted to mean the cancer was growing or spreading . I stood beside Rosalynn Carter in the East Room of the White House , speaking words about cancer . I could not look at Birch for fear the tears would come . The fear began all over again . And now there was another swollen  | node in my neck . The intensity of worry that week attacked my faith both in God and in doctors . What to do next ? My doctors disagreed . One wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's my life I wanted to scream . The decision would be mine . Birch and I prayed . I had surgery . It brought more bad news . These new tumors , too , were malignant . " When I begin chemotherapy , how long will I be on it ? " I asked . " For the rest of your life , " they said . Although I still had plenty of energy , the thieving of my time had begun . I went to California to tape my testimony for Reverend Schuller 's service at the Garden Grove Community Church . Arvella Schuller , his wife , became a radiant new friend in my life . On the program , which would be televised months later ( October 1978 and again in February 1979 ) , I told of enduring the suffering and losses of my life without having turned to God , and of the difference now that I was facing another crisis that prayer had made . I was feeling better and better . We spent a glorious Fourth of July weekend in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from Ruth Carter Stapleton , the President 's sister . She could visit with me on July 10 , 1978 , a Sunday . It was a beautiful experience ; she had a calming presence . She prayed for healing , for inner healing . I found her spirit very powerful , her commitment persuasive . The next morning , as I flew to New York for American Cancer Society meetings , I felt fantastic , like my old self . I thanked the Lord for that burst of energy . The ensuing four days in Oklahoma lifted me ever higher . I watched Oral Roberts preach . ( He had begun his ministry in my hometown . ) Afterward , he talked with me about the faith to move mountains . Then he asked me to pray for him . The summer of 1978 was beautiful . It was good for Evan too . I took a chunk of my own earned money , which I had been storing up for my old age , and made reservations for Evan and me to go to Europe .

In the fall , the pain came in my legs , in my back ? the most awful , screaming pain I had ever known . I prayed that it was only a pinched nerve , but the doctors were not encouraging . My cancer doctor compared new X-rays to those taken in June . " It is quite obvious , I 'm afraid , that it has spread , " he said quietly . I remember lying in bed at the time of President Carter 's talks with Prime Minister Begin of Israel and President Sadat of Egypt at Camp David , praying for God to touch my throbbing knee , praying for peace in the Middle East , praying for forgiveness , praying for a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this time I was getting accustomed to speaking with my God . I spoke to Him as a friend . I learned to leave it all to Him ? put my problems and my pain at His feet . And He took them and brought me a great love , and a peace and quiet . Alone in the country , reading and seeking God 's presence , I learned from a telephone call late on a September afternoon that the blood test , which had so alarmed me in May by shooting to 10 , was now up to 120 . At that point , I wrestled with the ultimate test of faith : that my greatest desire was to become closer to the Lord and Father and not be so concerned about healing . I do n't want to be cheated of this time of my life . But there really is n't much I can do about it , is there ? I have to let go ? try not to hold life so tightly , to rest and relax in the Lord . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , " I wrote on a little note pad . " If you can win this , it makes the other battles easier . " October 4 , 1978 . Today I hurried to my Cancer Society office in the rain . I had moved our meeting up an hour earlier so that I could dash to the Capitol in time to watch the vote on granting  | the states more time for their ratification of the ERA proposal . It was the first time I had been to the Senate gallery in over a year . Birch sent me a note in the gallery which said , " Hi there , Shotsie . I do n't know why we are voting to give you equality . There is no question that you are much more equal than I. You are everything to me . " Birch was the hero of the hour . When we went to the reception room off the Senate floor , it was filled with ERA supporters . When Birch came through on his way to the press gallery , they began to applaud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago today was when I checked into the hospital for my first biopsy . At home Birch loved to surprise me by leaving notes in outlandish places , leading me on like a treasure hunt . This time the notes led from the refrigerator , to the glove compartment of the car , to the jar of instant coffee , to the umbrella , to the photograph frame , to the washing machine , the furnace filter and finally to the piano . They instructed me about a package which one note ( signed with five hearts ) told me to open . Inside was a beautiful porcelain music box which played a cheery tune , Buttercup , from H.M.S. Pinafore . I came down with a cold . Or at least , with a temperature and cough . I sniffled in California , where I spoke to 2,000 women at the Garden Grove Community Church at a conference called Light Up Your Life . Pat and Shirley Boone were speaking there too . When I returned home I felt worse . I had a fever , but after prayer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement in Omaha , Neb . When I arrived in Omaha , I began to suffer pains in the left shoulder and chest . By morning I felt worse . On the way to the speech , I stopped at the emergency room of Nebraska Methodist Hospital . They wanted to keep me there . The X-rays showed fluid had built up in my left lung . Against the kindly doctor 's advice , I gave my speech . I prayed as I spoke . In Washington , 10 days later , they tapped my lung , drawing five pounds of fluid . The cancer had spread to the lining of my left lung . Although I have continued my public speaking both for the Cancer Society and for God , I have also been gratified by one-on-one contact with hurting human beings . They know that I have been hit with tragic , almost unbearable news . When people have cancer and ask me what they can do to bear it , they know I have walked these roads . I saw Katharine Hepburn on television and at 71 she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see people who are well at 80 , with great-grandchildren , enjoying holidays with their families . I want that . Birch and I sat at the Kennedy Center for the national tribute for Bob Hope 's 75th birthday . I want a 75th birthday party . I have screamed with anger , feeling trapped ? and I believe that is normal too . It helps to cry out the frustration , the bitterness . Then it 's easier to pull one 's self back together again . I think about all the wonderful friends I 've had in my life ? from those I knew in my earliest childhood to those new ones who have helped me walk with my God . I am overwhelmed by acts of kindness from our neighbors , who for months on end have brought in food when I 've been low on energy . Birch 's present staff ? all of them ? has been caring , understanding , supportive , reaching out to me as a friend . Birch has matured from this experience with me too . He has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley with a loved one , without its having a great impact . I am eternally grateful to him for standing with me the way he does . Today , February 14 , 1979 , I am celebrating my 46th birthday , wrapped in love . How fortunate can one be ? I am resting in the assurance that God loves me , that His love is the guiding force in my life , as it is in all things . I truly feel His healing power . And I will continue to praise Him , and to try to be of use to others of His children for as long as He gives me the life and strength to continue to try ....
