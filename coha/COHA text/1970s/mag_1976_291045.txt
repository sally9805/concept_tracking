Like 90 million of his fellow Americans , Jim Walsh of Royal Oak , Mich. , sat down with his family last Thursday night to watch the first Ford-Carter debate on their 21-in. color TV . But , unlike their neighbors , the Walshes had invited a stranger into the family room of their suburban home . Both Jim and Pat Walsh were undecided about whom they would vote for on Nov. 2 . So Detroit Bureau Chief Edwin Reingold asked if he could join them for the debate , to report firsthand on their reactions to the candidates . <P> Jim Walsh was one of 60 uncommitted voters selected for TIME by Daniel Yankelovich and Ruth Clark of the public opinion research firm Yankelovich , Skelly &; White Inc. , which has done political polling for us since 1972 .

" Still not completely decided , the Walshes plan to watch the remaining debates before making a final choice . <P> TIME has published five Yankelovich polls since the 1976 presidential campaign began last January , plus a special report of interviews with our Citizens ' Panel of 300 registered voters , to get a detailed picture of what the public thinks about the candidates and the issues . We will present the results of more polls , and another Citizens ' Panel survey , between now and Election Day . <P> During his interviewing for the latest poll ( TIME , Sept. 6 ) , Yankelovich discovered how uncertain a host of voters feel . " In 1972 , " he says , " people had pretty much made up their minds before the campaign began . " This time , even those who do favor Ford or Carter are surprisingly soft in their support . After surveying the response to the debate throughout the Midwest late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankelovich : " The road to the White House is as wide open as ever . "
