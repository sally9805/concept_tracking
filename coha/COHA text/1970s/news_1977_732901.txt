txt Japan and the United States are now pushing the throttle for more speed in their " locomotive economies " ? huge industrial machines that tend to pull along other nations economically as a diesel engine does a string of freight cars . The third " locomotive economy " ? West Germany ? has no plans for further fiscal stimulus . The Bonn government has already so severe a budget deficit it is reluctant to cut taxes or spend more . But if the Japanese and American measures work , the global economic lull that has caused such concern this past fall should be overcome . Indeed , the massive American economy already shows signs of a pickup in the pace of business activity after the early autumn pause . But the acceleration has not been sufficient to prevent President-Elect Jimmy Carter from announcing Friday a package of tax cuts and increased spending costing nearly $15 billion . The goal of the program is to create 800,000 jobs . The new Japanese Government of Takeo Fukuda is expected to announce a $1.5 billion tax cut later this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a second effort to stimulate the economy of the island nation . On Nov. 12 , the government adopted a seven-point program costing some $3.4 billion to propel the now-stagnant island economy onto a course of sustained growth . Most Japanese economists are now forecasting a 6 percent increase in real growth ( after inflation has been removed in 1977 ) . This is slower than usual growth rate in Japan prior to the recent recession . That 6 percent rate , if it occurs in the U.S. , would delight Mr. Carter . He has set a 6 percent increase in gross national product ? the output // From page 1 *U.S. and Japan plan to pull other nations by locomotive effect of goods and services ? as a target for 1977 . The majority of U.S. economists , however , believe growth will be slightly less than that . In Japan , industrial production for October , 1976 , was 2.2 percent below its level in July . Neither have exports or capital investments in Japan reached expected levels . Despite last fall 's measures to shove up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet of any response . Similarly , other major industrial powers are nervous about-the strength of their economies . In Canada , third-quarter real output growth in 1976 was a slow 3.3 percent . There-are signs that when the statistics are available the fourth quarter will look even worse . Britain 's newly announced austerity program is expected to mean almost no growth in 1977 and perhaps little in 1978 , too . In France , industrial output stagnated between last spring and summer . A big gain in the industrial production index in September has not been sustained since then . But optimism has been growing .. West Germany 's recovery started to slow last summer with no major signs yet of a step-up in the pace . Some economists are forecasting a mere 4 percent real growth in 1977 , not enough to put back to work many of the nation 's 1 million unemployed . The hesitation in the recovery from the world 's most serious business downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s understandably has many politicians nervous . Thus the prospect of a new economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Cooper , who will be the top economic official in the Carter State Department , is already on his way to Tokyo to discuss the economic situation . Mr. Carter announced Saturday that Vice-President Walter F. Mondale will visit both Japan and Western Europe during his first week in office to discuss , among other matters , an economic summit . Undoubtedly that summit , when it is held , will discuss whether each nation has done its part to contribute to a handsome worldwide economic recovery without too much inflation .
