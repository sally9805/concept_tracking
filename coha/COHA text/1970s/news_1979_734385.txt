txt CHICAGO HAS LOST its coveted AA bond rating from Standard &; Poor 's , the influential New York bond rating service , Mayor Byrne reported Wednesday . Moody 's Investors Service , another major bond rating service , reported that it is reviewing Chicago 's Aa rating , but has taken no action . The tower S &P; rating di i+-pies means that the City of Chicago could be required to pay up to one quarter of one per cent more in interest on general obligation bonds it sells . The amount of interest paid is tied to the bond rating , with the highest-rated bonds requiring the lowest interest payments . IN ANNOUNCING the new bond rating , Mayor Byrne said that the city has no plans to sell general obligation bonds soon . She also blamed the loss of the AA rating on poor financial practices by her predecessor , Michael A. Bilandic . But some observers said the mayor 's own widely publicized comments on the city 's financial problems helped lower the bond rating . " Mayor Byrne has perhaps talked too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lavern W. Kron , director of research for the Civic Federation , a watchdog group . Chicago obtained the AA rating several years ago under Mayor Richard J. Daley , who was said to have considered it his proudest financial achievement for the city . ONE PROMINENT local bond dealer said he was " shocked " by Standard &; Poor 's action . " I do n't believe the circumstances of the city are such that it deserves this downgrading of its bondsl , " said Donald R. Bonntwell , senior chairman of the board of Bonniwell &; Co. , 505 N. Lake Shore Dr. But he added that city bonds sold in the recent past were traded at lower prices than most other AA-rated bonds , an indication that the bond market had downgraded the bonds before S &P; acted . From that standpoint , discussions about the city 's financial problems " have not been helpful , " he said . ROBERT GEIER , a Standard &; Poor 's rating officer , said there were four major reasons the firm 's rating committee voted to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating deficit that reduced the balance in Chicago 's corporate fund from $30 million on Jan. 1 , 1978 , to $8 million on Jan. 1 , 1979 . This means that in 1978 Chicago spent $22 million more than it took in . ? A growing cash deficit in the city 's revolving funds  --  the money one city department owes another for various services . Geier said that the deficit in the revolving funds was $82 million at the end of 1978 and is expected to be $94 million at the end of this year . This revolving fund problem is one that Mayor Byrne has discussed many times . Because revolving fund payments are // Chicago loses top financial rating // mainly bookkeeping transactions hetween various city departments , some financial experts thought the mayor 's comments about " deficits " in this area were overly alarmist . ? The use of nonrecurring income sources  --  such as the sale of assets ? to finance city operations . The city has done very little of this , but It plans to sell city-owned parking facilities and the Bridewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor financial move because the sales are once-only transactions . ? The rollover of certain city liabilities from one year to the next . Chicago apparently had been paying for one year 's hospitalization expenses for city employes out of the next year 's budget . CITY HALL INSIDEILS said most of Chicago 's financial problems are the result of two consecutive years of record snow . The heavy snows were responsible for much of the problem with the revolving funds , the largest of which belongs to the Department of Streets and Sanitation , the department that is in charge of snow removal . The department 's revolving fund was depleted when the city departments did not pay for work done for them by the street department . The cost of snow removal was especially high last winter , when near-crisis conditions prevailed . The city has estimated that 1978-79 snow-removal costs could be about $70 million , compared with $5 million for a normal winter . The total city budget is $1.35 billion . In discussing the city 's financial situation , Mrs. Byrne said that until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolving funds . They did n't know we had them . " But Geier said Standard &; Poor 's had known about the revolving funds for a long time . MILS . BYRNE SAID the city will develop finance programs to win back the higher bond rating . She also described the new A-plus rating as " extremely strong . " In criticizing the Bilandic administration she said : " From the very first day I came to this office for the transition , I was warned by the previous administration that if the truth came out I 'd be very embarrassed , and it might affect the bond ratin , , . " I 'm not part of a coverup and I 'm not part of a lie . If we had slipped badly , I 'd say , ' That 's really unfortunate . ' I 'm not one who 's going to lie to the people about the financial condition of the government . " SIZE DISPUTED that her talk about city finances helped lower the rating . " If we 're going to be selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not . What we 're doing Is stating that what there is ffinancially1 is really there . I do n't believe in government by deceit . " The mayor said that though the city has no plans to issue bonds soon , the independent Chicago Public Building Commission has canceled plans to sell $29 million in bonds to finance a number of projects , including the , renovation of Navy Pier . But a member of the commission said nn decision on the bond sale has been made . He also said that the commission has received no hint that its own AA bond rating is in danger .
