THE greatest immediate result of the currency realignment will be to restore stability to world finance and end the danger of a global donnybrook in trade . Since President Nixon in August canceled the U.S. commitment to exchange dollars for gold , the values of several major currencies have been fluctuating , and uncertainty about where they would come to rest has held back world commerce . There was always a threat that in order to protect their own trade positions nations would erect beggar-thy-neighbor barriers against each other 's goods and money . <P> Now the U.S. is in the position of a company that reduces its prices . It will have to produce more goods and services to earn a given amount of foreign currency . There will be little change in the purchasing power of U.S. money for U.S.-made goods , but there will be painful consequences for Americans who work or travel abroad . The dollar devaluation , for instance , generally will have the same effect as a substantial salary cut for overseas employees of U.S. corporations who are paid in dollars ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the values of other currencies . Still , the consequences of the currency changes will in the main be highly beneficial for Americans . Devaluation should increase sales and profits of many U.S. companies and create more jobs in industries concerned with foreign trade . The prospects : U.S. EXPORTS will drop in price around the world . The Boeing Co. figures that devaluations and revaluations could knock the equivalent of $2.5 million off the $25 million cost of a 747 jumbo jet to some foreign airlines . F.S. Holway , president of the Coal Exporters Association of the U.S. , calculates that an 8% devaluation would have the same effect as a price cut from $14 to $13 a ton on coking coal sold to Japanese steel mills . The actual effect would be even greater , since the yen will go up a total of 17% against the dollar . American farmers stand to reap some of the biggest gains . For example , about half the Midwest soybean crop and 85% of the winter wheat grown in Washington State is sold to foreigners . Farmers look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their foreign-currency prices . <P> U.S. IMPORTS of Volkswagens , Yamaha motorcycles , French wines , British woolens and many other goods will cost more . The effect of the currency shifts will be offset somewhat by removal of the import surcharge , and some importers may try to keep dollar prices down in an effort to hold markets . A trade specialist of the Union Bank of Switzerland , however , estimates that " even with the surcharge removed , Swiss watches will be 15% more expensive in America . " Certainly not all U.S. consumers will switch to American-made products . Fanciers of Scotch whisky , for instance , are unlikely to opt for bourbon or rye , no matter what happens to the price . Still , higher prices for imports should create more sales and job opportunities in the U.S. industries that compete against them-notably in autos , steel and textiles .
