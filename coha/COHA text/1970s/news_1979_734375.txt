txt MAYOR BYRNE 'S relations with organized labor worsened Friday when she accused labor leaders of trying to scuttle a committee preparing an ordinance to permit collective bargaining for city workers . She responded to remarks made after the resignation of two influential labor leaders from the committee . The two , William A. Lee , president of the Chicago Federation of Labor , and Alice Peurala , president of the United Steel Workers of America Local 65 , said the mayor broke campaign promises with words and actions they consider to be antilabor . " Big labor is throwing a big smokescreen up right now , " the mayor said . " In my opinion , it the walkout by Lee and PeuralaI was designed to prevent collective bargaining . They do n't want to see other unions come in here . To attack others is a desperation play because they arc concerned their power will not be as extensive . " MRS .

These workers could end up with less under a separate , formal contract , observers said . The walkout and denunciations by Lee and Peurala were part of a continuing battle of words between the mayor , who said this week she won election without labor support and labor officials who have long had close tics to City Hall . Before Mrs. Peurala left the commit // Byrne assails 2 who quit her labor panel // tee meeting , she said , " Mayor Byrne 's recent action  --  suspending city workers , threatening to cut the wage of organized craft workers , her refusal to meet with firefighters , and the final blow of hiring Seyfarth , Shaw , Fairweather &; Geraldeon , the most notorious union-busting pawl firm in the nation , to advise her on the committee  --  leave no illusions in the minds of Chicago union workers that her campaign promises were a sham . " THE MAYOR , when asked about the " promises , " said the only commitment she made during her campaign was to firemen and police . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was against collective ' bargaining , " she said . " We made a commitment to the firemen and police . The rest of it was along the lines that after it was all over  --  after everything is decided ? I believe city workers should get a contract with the right to collective bargaining . We have attempted to get the facts through the committee so anyone could make a valid judgment . " But I do n't think anybody runs that chair but me , and I do n't believe anyone can get into my mind to see how I feel .

Oberman said he could not disagree with some of the statements made by Lee and Mrs. Peurala . " Their quarrel is not with the committee , but with the mayor , " agreed Warren Bacon , of Inland Steel Co. , a business representative on the committee and a former Chicago School Board member . Lee , charging that the committee was stacked against labor , said : " I 've been taught never to walk out , but to stand and fight . But I realize when the deck is stacked against you , and I 'm going to withdraw . This is it . " Oberman told him , " Bill , I 've been in office five years and my ideas have n't been listened to , but I stayed and fought . You should n't lose the opportunity to have your views heard . " Oberman was referring to the fact that as an independent he was a city council outcast until Mrs. Byrne became mayor .

Organized labor 's differences with the mayor stem from her suspension of unionized city workers for loafing and her criticism of the policy of paying city employes the same wages paid by private industry , even though they may do less work . THESE DIFFERENCES increased after the mayor said she does n't need the backing of labor leaders . Friday she denied that she had made such a statement . But then she said , " I stated yesterday Thursday , and I repeat , history has spoken better than I on that subject . Labor leaders supported another individual Michael Bilandiel , and most of the people whom they represented voted for me . " The mayor also discussed the failure of labor leaders to buy tickets to her Oct. 15 fund-raising dinner , to be attended by President Carter . She said that the presence or absence of labor leaders at the dinner is not going " to make the City of Chicago knuckle under . The buying of $100 tickets does n't give anyone the chance to hold anyone hostage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
