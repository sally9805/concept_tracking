AH SAMUEL : CHAPTER13 ND it came to pass after this , that Absalom the sou of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her . 2 And Amnon was so vexed , that he fell sick for his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and Amnon thought it hard for hint to do any thine to her . 3 But Amnon hail a friend . whose name was lunation , the son of Shimeah David 's brother : and Jonadab was a very sulatil man . 4 And he said unto him . Why art thou , being the king 's son , lean from day to day ? wilt thou not tell me ? And Ananon said unto him , I love Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister . 5 And Jonadah said unto him , Lay thee down on thy bed , and make thyself sick : and when thy father commit to see thee , say auto hint , I pray thee , let my sister Tamar came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sight , that I may see it , and eat it at her hand . 6 So Amnon lay down , and made himself sick ; and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said ants the king , 1 pray thee , ler Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand . 7 Then David sent home to Tamar , saying , Cm now to thy brother Amnon 's house , and dress him ' neat . 8 So Tamar went to hor brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . And she took floor , and kneaded it . and made cakes in his sight , and did hake the cakes . 9 And she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; nut he refused to eat . And Amnon said , Have nut all men from me . And they went ant every man from him . 10 And Amnon said unto Tamar , Bring the meat into the chamber , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother . 11 And when she had brought them ante him to eat , he took hold of her , and said unto her , Come lie with me , my sister . 12 And she answered him , Nay . my brother , do not force me ; for no such thing ought to he done in Israel : do not thou this folly . 13 And 1 , whither shall I range my shame to go and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . Now therefore , I pray thee . speak unto the king : for he will not withhold me from thee . 14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice : but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her . 15 11 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the lose wherewith he had loved her . And Amnon said unto her . Arise , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no came : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me . But he would not hearken unto her . 17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him , and said , Put now this woman ran from me. and hob the door after hex. 18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . Then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her . 19 And Tamer put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and aid her hand on her head . and went on crying , 20 And Absalom her brother said unto her , flatli Amnon thy brother been with thee ? but hold now thy peace , my sister : he is thy brother : regard not this thing . So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absa  --  rim 's house . Dan Jacobson THE RAPE OF TAMAR excerpts from a novel I T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are determined to secure for themselves exemption from the humiliations and misfortunes that others simply have to endure as best they can . Yet once the ambitious have achieved power and position , they and their families become more , not less , exposed to temptation , to error , to disastrous reversals of r fortune . Hence , in the end , all they succeed in turning themselves into are great exemplars of the ordinary , overwhelming instances of the commonplace . Look at my cousin , Amnon ! Ordinary men who begin to burn and shiver with desire for their closest female relations are usually compelled to find the best release their own busy fingers muter the bedclothes can bring them . But the very powerful are in a position to take greater risks . " What 's the point of being a prince if you ca n't do it ? " I said to Amnon at one stage , after he had confessed his secret to me . Whereupon he replied , as if all those wretches with their hands under the bedclothes had their eyes fixed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prince if I do ? " Exactly . It was a good reply , I had to admit . Better than I would have thought Amnon capable of making . Even though I did find something comical , at the same time , in the idea of Amnon solemnly trying to put himself forward as a model of self-restraint and high-mindedness , as a being uncontaminated by the filthy desires of the mass of mankind . Amnon ? The same man who in other moods made such a point of impressing on me how irresistible was the passion that drove him ; of begging me to realize that he could no more be blamedfor what he fell than an epileptic could be blamed for rolling on the ground in the midst of his seizure . He was gripped by illness , madness , fate .... It was all very impressive . I was most impressed . I still am , whenever I have to recall his cries and ejaculations on the subject . Also , I must acknowledge that Tamar did indeed turn out to he his fate ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as he , in a different way , turned out to be hers . However , my skepticism compels me to add that once Amnon had allowed himself to set his eyes on the girl , the only possibilities open to him were either to exercise complete self-restraint or to start talking about madness and fate and all the rest of it . What other justification could he offer her , or himself , or anyone else ? No. it had to be love , true love , overmastering love , all-devouring love . The works . Or nothing . What a choice . What a pair of alternatives . Especially to someone like Amnon , who had been given more and more reason to suppose that nothing was just what he was cut out to he . Nothing in the eyes of his father ; nothing in the eves of his brothers : nothing in the eyes of the rest of the court ; nothing in the eyes of that God or those gods in whose powers he intermittently believed . Despite Isis singularities , Amnon was riot so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and just like the rest of us he carried around with him certain uneasy , recurring apprehensions of his own worthlessness , his own absolute inconsequence . But hying the son of a king , the possible heir to a kingdom , and a young man of many baffled passions and ambitions , he also had unusually bold ideas of the power and im-portance that could be his if only he dared to be more than nothing . For it was n't just as an exemplar of self-restraint to the swinish masses that Amnon could picture rimself . There were other obvious possibilities open : o him ; other examples he could follow , or set . Near mough to us. both historically and geographically , xere those Egyptian kings . divine themselves , whose rrhles were transformed into their divine sisters ipon ascending to the royal bed .

If the son and daughter of a ; in ' 7 . broke the laws , or went beyond them , then urely anything could be possible : new laws or no aws , another life . a share in eternity , the banishnent of death .

And tow could Amnon , of all people , forget that Baal . nd Anat , according to some legends , were in a state if indecisive , continuous rebellion against the ilder , higher , dimmer paternal god , El ? The same tory again ! Always the same damn story ; the same ncitements , opportunities , and compulsions . FTER ALL OF WHICH I FEAR you will be disappointed when I introduce you to Tamar . A oddess ? An instrument of fate and doom ? She hardly looks it . She is much too young , too slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kind and patronizing you might think of her as " a pretty little thing . " H you wanted to be dismissive and somewhat out-of-date in your idiom I you could call her " a slip of a girl . " If you wanted to be nasty you could say that she is " a spoiled little brat . " Oval eyes , a sallow complexion , lips that are full and have a faintly bluish or purple tint . A lithe , immature body , concealed and revealed by the robes she wears . Thin wrists . A small foot . Gold ornaments in her hair and around her childish neck . A curiously stealthy , undulating walk . An air of gravity that is n't really accounted for by anything she ever says , or by any emotion she ever shows . What else ? A habit of holding her head quite still when she speaks . llre effect being a little theatrical , as if she is delivering something learned of by heart . There she is then , as best as I can briefly describe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fvfa'acah , who had herself been daughter of the so-called " King of Geshur " ; sister to Absalom ; half-sister to Amnon and all the other princes . David adores her . Though he has other daughters , vi horn he pays no attention , by his concubines , Tamar is his only daughter by one of his official wives . So he thinks of her as his only daughter , he calls her his only daughter ; and he loves her with all the weakness and storm of his many-sided heart . Solomon aside , there is no child of his who is as much petted and to whom so much is permitted . When she was a child he was always dandling and nuzzling her ; now that she is a young woman he merely watches her with a regard that is wondering , attentive , kindly , a little pathetic in its combination of awareness and incomprehension , experience and helplessness . In a curious way his regard is detached , almost impersonal : one feels that every time he looks at her he has to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these are not the limits of the world either . It is striking , too , that though the king has become so much more garrulous as he has grown older , he is generally rather silent in Tarriar 's company . He listens carefully when she speaks to him , and accedes readily enough to any request she makes of him : but his reticence nevertheless creates an area of stillness around the two of them which the rest of us are careful not to intrude upon . We hold our breath , so to speak , whenever they are together ; it sometimes shocks us that Tamar does not do so as well . Instead , and inevitably perhaps , she takes her position in the regard of the king quite for granted . She has a calm . unquestioning belief in her own importance that would make her insufferable if she were n't also rather an obliging girl on the whole , usually eager to be approved of , and much impressed by the prowess of her father and all her brothers . H she lacks humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loses her temper sometimes it is never with her father or her brothers , but only with the servants and other women of the royal household , and she makes her complaints about them to the king in the most charming manner : widening her eyes and dropping 1 not raising ) her voice , as if she finds it quite incredible that anyone should be intentionally disobliging to her . That drop of her voice , it is plain , delights the king , it is enough to make him infirm with tenderness and amusement . Tamar , of course , knows it . She imagines that she knows everything she will ever really need to know . As you see , my tone about her is cool . I prefer that it should be so ; for if it were n't , it would he intemperate . Christ ! ? if I may call on the name of the most famous of my family connections  --  that these creatures , these young girls , should have the power over us that they do ! Just because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes : because they have slender hips that are wider . all the same . than their sloping shoulders : because they move their arms this way , turn their heads that way , draw breath in such a rhythm , lean forward or back with so many other crossings of curves , hollows , and inclinations . What trifling causes to produce such terrible consequences : filling us with yearning and exaltation , driving us to fight , hold , clutch , fuck , making us imagine that here  --  therenow  --  again  --  we will find surcease from all the hungers and uncertainties that plague us . From girls like Tamar who , in short . are quite unremarkable in every respect . H .411ASSED . LETS SAY . BY THESE SEDITIOUS or at any rate resentful thoughts , I break my bread and reach into the howl of mutton stew that standsin the middle of the table , while the king , always a sparse eater and drinker , reclines on a couch and looks with satisfaction on the heartiness of his sons ' appetites . Tamar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; something that the king permits only within the privacy of the family circle . Tamar eats languidly , with long pauses between each mouthful : her stool is at the foot of David 's couch , and thus near the head of the table ; she is half-turned toward her father , and I am able to see her from the side only . Fruit . Wine . Small cakes dipped in honey . Bowls of water in which to wash our hands . We are replete The kingdom is at peace , and for the moment so are we . It is evident to all of us that we deserve our good fortune : our position in the court , our decorated room , our handsome tableware , the food we have just eaten . The king beckons to the musician who has been standing to one side , ready to play if he should be asked to do so , and the man hastens over and drops on his knees before his master . David takes the lyre from him and tunes it . His expression is sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill with the instrument yet complacently certain that we will be gratified by his condescension in playing for us , for he is known to do it only when he is in an excellent humor , He plucks a tune from the seven strings , his head lowered , his thin , young-looking fingers working strongly yet tremulously among them . He looks up as the last note hums its way into silence . None of us would dare to applaud , but we all try to look as though no applause could ever do justice to the ineffable aesthetic experience we have just enjoyed . " Come . Tamar , " the king says . " I 'll play . and you 'll sing . " Tamar considers for a moment , then shakes her head . Her refusal is n't pert : merely disinclined , idle . " That 's not very kind of you . We would all enjoy it . " " I would n't . " " A h , that 's just what you say now ? " The king is begging her . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion or embarrassment : if anyone is embarrassed it is the king . Bathsheba says reprovingly , " Tamar ! " and for her pains . earns a glare from the king . He calls the musician over once again , and hands the lyre hack to him . " No , I do understand , " he says eventually , with some effort , as if answering a comment none of us has made . know how Tamar feels . If you have talent people imagine that it 's easy for you to make use of it whenever you 're asked to do so . But it is n't easy at all . " With every phrase he visibly feels a little better , the words come more freely : he is turning the incident more and inure to Turner 's advantage , and hence to his own as well . Instead of having witnessed a bit of impertinence on her part , you understand . we have been privileged to gain an insight into the temperament of the artist : a temperament which only David can truly understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon he will be quite warm on the subject . But Tamar interrupts him by rising and taking a few steps hack from the table so that she stands almost against the wall . She bows her head deeply to him in a gesture of submission , clasping her hands together at her waist . She waits until everyone has finished turning on his stool to see her and has fallen silent . The king gives her a measured nod of approval before looking satisfiedly around the table ; from his expression you would think Tamar has now not only vindicated completely what he was saying but has also demonstrated the depth of her obedience to him . Then she opens her lips and begins to sing , unaccompanied . Her voice is small , but pleasing ; the song is simple , and makes no demands of her which she can not meet ; the words are familiar to us all . A young girl , a stern father , a poor young wooer who has neither metal nor flocks but only his strength and beauty to offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws a deep breath into her chest between each verse , a lesser breath at the end of each line . A tiny flicker or contraction of her brow warns us that she has lost a phrase ; a glance of reassurance at her - father before her lips and tongue utter it shows us that she has foiled it again . David has not taken his eyes off her since the song began . Absalom , too , has been watching her closely . He is obviously touched by the delicacy and sweetness of her appearance , by the fragility of her voice , even perhaps by the trite words of the song she is singing ; he is anxious , as any loving brother might be , that she should acquit herself well . Yet the approving tilt of his head suggests that in her perfor - mance , and in e hat went before it , he has been confirmed in his belief that the children of Ma'acah will always be the recipients of special favors , that they will always be set apart for good reasons from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hi'lalala IT/a , yi'no , 1 ' OR THE LAST TIME TAMAR repeats the meaning- less , melancholy refrain of the song . Then she returns to her stool , white we applaud . A pleasant domestic scene . However , as you have doubtless guessed , I have n't described it at such length for its own sweet sake , but because it was at that moment , according to Amnon , or at one so much like it as to make no difference , that " it " happened to him ; that his madness began ; that he saw Tamar for what she would henceforth be to him . ' Whether Amnon was telling the truth in saying this is something I ca n't vouch for . I simply do n't know whether or not you should believe his talk about the softness and warmth he felt beneath her dress when she brushed past him on her way back to her stool ; about the scent from her hair that suddenly filled his nostrils ; about the glimpse he had of a small , curved hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lying . For all I know , he may , without ever having told me of it , have cherished lustful thoughts about " Christ ! ? that her ever since his childhood ; when they were children he may already have lingered her beneath beds and behind curtains , gathering dust and guilt together . I do n't know . And except for what it reveals about his own festering state of mind , I certainly would n't attach any importance to his claim that it was partly because of the way David and Absalom had looked at the girl that he found himself possessed by desire for her . That , seeing how they looked at her , he realized , however inarticulately , the power he might be able to exercise over them through Tamar : yes , it seems plausible enough . But that they were lusting after her , that they were looking at her with " goals ' eyes " ( to use his words ) : no , that 's pure Amnon , pure guilt , pure confusion . You would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even then you 'd probably have difficulty at times . Anyway , he always stuck to his story . Always the passion came to him from nowhere , from everywhere : from a glint in his father 's moist eye . from the sound of a drawn breath , from the upraised beak of a bird on the mural , from a flicker of light off a goblet of wine , from a soft pressure against his shoulder . For some minutes he is stifled , uncomprehending , there is a pressure in his ears , he stares at an apple core on his plate , a gnawn , scraggy thing in which brown seeds nestle , each in its own split , smooth-textured pod . He does not think of Tamar , he does not think at all his mind is empty . Then understanding returns to him , but as if it were a physical sensation : Ile feels it pass through his head , from an unknown center within him , moving outward in a single pang , gathering strength , growing ever more sharp and bladelike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast and forehead are cleaved with an exquisite pain , still moving out of himself . He will fall , he will faint , he a ill lie shattered and split . Instead he finds himself on his feet . He has uttered two words , only two , but for the moment they have saved him from that knife blade within . " Tamar ! " he has said ; and , " No ! " " Did n't you see me stand up ? " he asked me , later . " Did n't you see how I looked around ? " I had to admit that I had n't noticed him doing so . It was possible he had ; but the meal , always informal , was at its end ; others may have stood up at the same time , or just after . How could I tell ? " Ach ! " Amnon replied . with disgust at my impercipience . He had stood there like a drunk , for minutes on end , looking vaguely around him , looking everywhere but at Tamar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only seemed to him that minutes were passing : perhaps that was why I had n't noticed him . He may have stood at his place for a few seconds only , the slowest he had ever endured . While they lasted he knew with perfect clarity and simplicity all that was later to become confused within him , labyrinthine , hopeless . He knew that he desired Tamar as he had never desired anyone in his life before ; and he knew that she was forbidden to him . Forbidden by the law , by his father , by his brothers , by his duty to cherish and protect her . These contradictory facts maintained a perfect equipoise in his mind , as if he had indeed been split in two : there was no communication , no connection , between them . It was only later that they came together in knowledge of one another and interpenetrated with one another , so that he could accuse himself of loving her because she was forbidden to him : or could accuse God , society , and his father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her . ( Yes , I assure the psychoanalytically minded among you that these rudimentary insights were vouchsafed very early and quite spontaneously to our interesting case , A. ) By then he was deep in his labyrinth , isolated in the rooms of the house his father had given him . During that time he did n't see anyone apart from his servants , until the night he sent for me . As for Tamar , he claimed he had left the room that evening without looking at her again . He did not need to ; lie could riot bear to . I ADIES AND GENTLEMEN , I have a confession to 4 make . I am in some doubt about how to proceed with the next part of my story . You know , as I do , that Amnon is not going to be able to resist his desire for his sister Tamar , he is not going to rise above it , he is not going to he restrained either by pity for her or by dread of the consequences of pursuing her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make real to you , or interesting to you ( it amounts to the same thing I the torments of indecision Amnon went through before lie finally succumbed to what thus became his fate . His prayers . his insomnia. his bouts of drunkenness , his vows of chastity , his threats to commit suicide . his hastily conceived and hastily abandoned plans to leave the country  --  what nonsense all these will seem to you , what a waste of time , when you see them I as you mustl as a tedious preface to a foregone conclusion . How can you possibly sympathize with the agony of his vacillation when you have the certainty of knowing what he actually did  --  and must do again each time the story is told , for as long as it continues to be told ? Very well then , you may say . let 's just accept that he 1% ent through such a period , and get on with what followed it . But the problem is not quite so simple . As far as A MIMI is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely because it happened , so to speak , and thus is entitled to its place in the story , but because of the consequences it had . If you do not understand how much Amnon had to overcome within himself , how keen was his own sense of the enormity of the crime he wanted to commit , then I am afraid you will also be unable to understand his subsequent actions . which , wild and brutal though they may have been . yet followed their own logic of hope and despair . That 's one point . The second weighs with me even a little more , perhaps . It is n't just for Amnon 's sake that I dwell on the difficulty he had in making up his mind to act as he did . No , it 's for the sakeof the figure that I , Yonadab , am to cut in this story . Allow me my measure of vanity , too , my desire to appear to have influenced the course of events . Crucially . I urged Amnon to commit the crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for being cowardly and split-minded , I told him of the special affection for him that I pretended I had seen in Tamar 's eyes , I reminded him of the freedom he had by virtue of his position as the king 's oldest son . Yet what status will I have in your eyes as meddler. middleman , pander . if you simply take , it for granted that Amnon WdS bound to have done what he did anyway : if you do not realize , that is to say , just how evenly balanced were the impulses inside him ? ( Though that delicate image of a balance hardly indicates the crazed lurchings of his temperament and will . ) If you are to have any respect for me , any feeling that I am more than a mere narrator but an active participant in the story , then it is essential that you should see Amnon poised between two equally possible courses of action , and me at his elbow guiding and advising him to take the one he eventually took . Had I behaved differently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Jerusalem at least , or consoled himself with other women , or transformed his desire for Tamar into a passion of another kind  --  religious , perhaps , or warlike . I worked hard on him , I can tell you : and I know , however it might seem to you who have the benefit of hindsight , that I was n't wasting my hreadi . All right , you want to know why I did what I did ? Why else , except for the reason I have just given ! To feel that I counted for something in the court : that my words had consequences ; that my presence had made a difference to events . That 's why . A modest ambition , in the circumstances . Also , I will tell you that I had a certain grudge against Tamar , as you may already have suspected from my description of her . Say it was a grudge I had against all David 's children , for having so many advantages over me . But there was more to it than that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her  --  at least as far as I was concerned  --  that I found very difficult indeed to forgive. , Especially as my intolerable father , in one of his more ambitious moods . had suggested to his equally intolerable brother that I might be a suitable parti for the girl . The king had rejected me out of hand , and I admit I have no real reason to suppose that Tamar had ever got to hear about it . But I still found her lack of curiosity about me insulting to a degree . Did she imagine that I was too low , too insignificant , to he worthy of focusing those dark eyes of hers upon ? In that case , she was wrong . But only on condition , you understand , that I could have saved her , and instead helped to damage her , ruin her . break her life apart . I SEE THAT I CAN , in fact , do no more than state my problem : I can not resolve it . Amnon 's torment of indecision is something that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I whisper in his ear what I must , and what only Amnon will ever hear . He comes to his decision . Choice once made , the illusion of choice ceases to exist ; it is as though it has never been , The period he has just gone through appears absurd and craven to us both . And tedious too . Just as it would be to you if I were to go through it stage by stage , word by word , scene by scene . Now the rest can follow . Time to begin again what we began then . S 0 IT WAS , OR IS , THAT AMNON approaches and tells me quietly , his face taut yet puckered , two print , disgusted lines running down either side of his jaw , as with the jaw of a puppet , " I 've made up my mind . " The quietness of his voice and the stiffness of his carriage are also new . I have seen him look like this only once before : when we were boys , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his father 's wars , and Amnon had made up his mind to go into the front line , no matter what the officer who had been put in charge of us should do or say . His face  --  boyish and unmarked then  --  and his body had been turned , as they are now , toward a self-chosen , never-to-be-averted fate . That time all had turned out well . I doubt if it will do so again . I do n't pretend that I need to ask him which way his decision has gone . " Of course . I always knew you would . " You lie . " I do n't respond , so he says it again . " You lie , you bastard . " He still has n't raised his voice , yet he manages to compress into it the hatred he suddenly feels toward me . For being his ally : for encouraging him to follow the course he has taken ; even for having known at once what he was talking about . nays have passed since we last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Tamar ; our present meeting has taken place by chance , in the street , in broad daylight . Preoccupied with my own affairs , my eyes cast downward to avoid the glare of the sun , I had n't noticed Amnon until he had called my name out ; and then he had spoken without any preamble or preliminary . Now he stands in front of me , stalwart , swarthy , haggard , braced by his own will , and calls me a liar , a bastard , a cheat , and many other unpleasant things . His thick lips move busily , and 1 watch them without really listening to the words they are producing . I think of those lips pressed flat upon Tamar 's pale face . Yes ! Yes , it is right that Amnon should be ugly , that when you look at him You should think of bulls , idols. archaic statuary , misshapen trees , apes from Africa . He is fitted for his role , fated for it , as I ant . I suppose ( but can never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hot sunlight pouring down upon us both , these people passing by , that barefoot , doubled-up porter staggering along under a great , lolling load of offal in a hag , which is tier ! to him by a single band of leather around his forehead . And those flies following him , in a frenziedly spinning , singing halo . Then , with barely a pause between abuse and request for assistance , and with hardly a change of tone , Amnon says , " I need your help . " eviihy ? " He swears at me again , but less energetically than before , and for a shorter time . Then there comes the same request . " You must help me . " It is plainly inconceivable to him that I should n't do so . " We must talk about it . Not now , but soon . As soon as possible . " In my opinion , he is wrong . For my part , there 's no need for haste . Between this moment and the moment of consummation there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no doubt that he will go through them to the end . Henceforth any delays or diversions will only harden his resolve , inflame him all the more , make more vivid his fantasies . Accordingly , I can let him stew in his own juice ; the juice will be so much the ranker as a result . So I pretend to be quite as eager as he is to meet as soon as possible , to discuss the matter further , to formulate the plans he is obviously expecting me to think up . ( Amnon is enough of a realist , I see , to know that I am cleverer than he is.1 It is imperative that we should meet , yes , I agree , I do understand that . But alas , I tell him , it is n't possible . As it happens , 1 declare untruthfully , but with great regret , I am on the very point of leaving Jerusalem for several days . On official business . Something my father has asked me to do . No , it ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It 's out of the question . Not even to help Amnon at such a moment of crisis . But , I point out to him  --  untruthfully again , and knowing that he will disagree with me violently  --  now that he has come to his decision , the worst is over : now he can afford to relax , to take things easy . Now he is in a position to enjoy the delights of anticipation . I am even bold enough to hint that these delights may he more intense than those of achievement . This is the first truth I have uttered for a few minutes , but it is one which no keen anticipator could ever accept : if he did , he would cease to he one and would become instead someone like myself . Predictably . I succeed only in angering Amnon . But he does n't swear at me now . He asks me if we ca n't meet that night ; if I ca n't come to his house right away : if we ca n't just stay where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , none of these is possible either . I simply have n't the time . Moreover , I tell him , we must be circumspect from now on ; we must n't draw attention to ourselves , as we are doing by standing in the middle of the street and talking together like a couple of merchants . People arc looking at us : they are not used to seeing men dressed in court robes in such a position . They will think that something is amiss unless we leave each other now in a calm , superior manner " Let them look ! " Amnon shouts . His voice is suddenly triumphant , that of a man who has found himself at last . " I 'll give them something- to stare at , you wait and see ! " Poor devil . He will , indeed . Already he sees in their whispers and sidelong glances  --  what ? His name on their children 's lips , his picture in mu ? seums , books written about him , flowers of the field named after him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a place in his heart for all of them . his life being a summation and justification of their unknown , nameless existences . Poor devil ? More keenly than ever before , hearing that cry from his throat , seeing his rapt face , his lips curved in an inanely exalted smile . I envy him . To have a destiny is nothing : each of us has a destiny , no matter how niggardly or miserable it may be . But to believe in it , even fleetingly , to accept it as the only one possible for you that is something else again . Amnon is in that state , not I ; I never will be . All the more reason to let him stew in his own juice , then . " I must be going . I 'll come to see you immediately I get back into town . " " Not a moment later . " He turns to go . But some instinct of prudence or pride forces him to say , with a feeble attempt at nonchalance . " You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to you . " That is a risk 1 must run . I do n't believe it to be a great one . Not if I know Amnon . I smile and answer , " For your sake I hope it may be so . " We part , Amnon going up toward the palace , 1 away from it . But I have taken only a few paces when I hear Amnon " s footsteps behind me , He halts me again , putting his hand on my shoulder . " You sec , - he says , in a tone that is now one of labored , fanatical reasonableness , as of a man clinging to his faith in rational procedures and explanations , in the teeth of all temptations to abandon them , " you see , I have to break the law in order to show that I 'm really free to obey it . You understand what I mean ? If I obey it just because I 'm too seared to do anything else , then what is my obedience worth ? But afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the law really has meaning for me , because I understand it , because I 'm a man who 's set himself free to do the oilier thing and yet chooses not to . Do you see what I mean ? " His essay in logic is concluded . I want to cry " Bravo ! " To think that Amnon could work through such a piece of Jesuitical casuistry all on his own ! Amnon , whom no one in the world has ever accused of being particularly strong in the top story . Filth and impiety for the sake of a freer , more godlike piety ( in a little while , later , in the end , after he 's had his sport ? what could be better ? Talk about eating your cake and having it ! It just goes to show what really passionate desire ran do to exercise the mind . " Yes , " I say . " I do see what you mean , Amnon . I wo n't forget what you 've just said . " This time he leaves me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I have to leave Jerusalem for a few days , which I had n't planned to do , and is a little inconvenient at such short notice . Never mind . I have something to look forward to when I get back .... INCE NO ONE ELSE IS LIKELY to say it , I have tt Odo so myself : there was a touch of genius in an plan I worked out for Amnon during the few days I spent unexpectedly in the country . My plan fol bringing him together with Tamar could be grandly , called a series of interlocking ironies : but for all its inward complexity , it had the merit as well of being simple and to the point . In retrospect and anticipation , I do n't know which aspect of the plan gives me more satisfaction , its simplicity or its complexity . Both , at any rate , contributed equally to its success . I am boasting , yes . But consider the difficulties I had to overcome in bringing the two of them together ; in bringing them together alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Amnon to declare his love to her and then to demonstrate it in whatever way he chose . ( Not that I had any doubt , after listening to him , which way he would choose . ) The difficulties in the way of such a meeting do n't seem so great to you ? Oh dear , it seems that we are faced here with what the anthropologists call a culture gap , which can be crossed only by a certain stretching of the imagination on your side , a certain amount of deliberate explication on mine . I will put the matter as baldly as I can , to begin with . Tamar lived in a harem . That is what the women 's quarters of David 's palace must be called . Now do you begin to get an idea of my difficulties ? But I beg you not to be carried away by your memories of Hollywood movies , say , or of booklets of pornographic pictures acquired on the Charing Cross Road . Put out of your mind those portraits of languid houris lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baggy silken pants brandishing scimitars outside mysterious , ogee-arched doorways . It was n't like that . The women 's quarters of David 's palace were quiet , domestic , respectable . Indeed , almost suburban . After all , your suburbs , too , are pretty much inhabited by women and children only during the daylight hours . Confined to their areas by day and night , David 's women chattered , promenaded , ate , looked after their children , quarreled , wove cloth , sewed , and generally passed their time as best they could . On high festivals they emerged to watch the sacrifices and parades from specially erected pavilions ; when a visitor of great importance arrived they crowded their roof terraces to see what they could of his reception . Of course , many distinctions were observed among them . Even among the king 's official wives there were some who had larger apartments , more clothes , more jewels , and more servants than others ; his concubines were invariably less generously treated , and any one among them who fell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant of another . That was the world in which Tamar had grown up : a cross , you might say , between a brothel with a single patron , an unusually secluded girls ' school or hospital for women , and a family home . Confusing , doubtless . But not so much more , perhaps , than your suburbs : merely different . Incidentally , the seclusion of the harem was maintained less by porters and patrolling guards than by the sheer numbers of women who lived in it . They were a far more effective watch upon one another than whole squads of scimitar-brandishing , baggy  --  pantalooned eunuchs ever could be . If your suburban adulterers often find themselves plagued by their neighbors , I do n't need to elaborate on how difficult it was for anything clandestine to take place in that part of the palace , with all its half-curtained doorways , its open courtyards and rooftops , its busy corridors . Even in the smallest hours of the night the place was likely to be astir with women who could n't sleep , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or who were walking their crying children about . Still , even given all these circumstances , my difficulties might have been less than they were if Tamar had lived in the harem as one of David 's wives or mistresses , rather than as his virgin daughter . A married woman , even one married to a king , always has reasons for leaving her husband for a few days . Her mother is sick , her sister is having a baby , her brother is trying to swindle her out of her estate and her presence is needed at home . These are just a few suggestions or excuses ; the married women among you have , I 'm sure , used others ; and I daresay so had David 's wives , who from time to time did leave the palace on their own affairs , lumbering of in closely escorted caravans along the stony roads that wound down , east and west , north and south , from our mountain city . But the case was different with the girls in the harem , David 's daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace were ever made on them ; there was nothing that could be offered to them from any quarter of the kingdom that David himself did not provide . And if so much was true of any virgin daughter of the king . remember what Tamar , and Tamar alone , was to David , The walls that surrounded her can he thought of as nothing more or less than a physical representation of his love and care : and you may be certain that he kept them in the best possible order . She had her own set of rooms , her own teachers and servants , who were all frequently questioned about her welfare ; David himself made a point of seeing her whenever he could . even if it was just for a few minutes in the day . Of all that he valued , she was the most greatly valued ; of all he protected , as king and father , she was the most protected . Which is why , thinking about what had to lie accomplished , I eventually decided , much to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the opening for Amnon in the walls that surrounded her : no one else could do it . She had to come to Amnon not behind the king 's back . not in despite of the king , still less in rebellion against him , but with his approval ; indeed , at his command . There was no other way it could be done . David must willingly turn Ihe key that only David held . Amnon 's ideas of grabbing at her in corridors , of trying to sneak unobserved into her apartments , of passing messages to her through servants , of somehow abducting her from the palace and riding hellfordeather with her , in high romantic fashion , into the deserts of Moab or Edom  --  all these schemes , which sure enough Amnon was to gabble out to me when I returned to the city , were a waste of time , so many dead ends . They would n't work . Whereas once David 's cooperation had been secured , Amnon would surely have the time and the opportunity he sought . Obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it required that everything both Amnon and I had at first imagined about his next move should be turned on its head . Only then did it seem obvious , as our best , most unexpected ideas often do . But why , you will ask , as I asked myself , should the king agree to releasing Tamar , however temporarily , from her confinement ? What could persuade him to do so ? And here the answer I eventually arrived at was again the obvious , utterly unexpected one . The truth , that 's all ! Not the whole truth , indeed ; but the truth nevertheless . Amnon did n't have to dissimulate ; I was n't going to ask him to tell any elaborate lies . All he had to do was to let his father know that he had fallen ill  --  which was assuredll , lie truth : he was sick , diseased , a case : anyone could see it  --  and then , once he had succeeded in arousing his father 's compassion and anxiety , he had to ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that only she could cure his illness . And what , I ask you , could be truer than that ? But the final and , in my view , the most delicious irony was that the king would think his request a reasonable one , and would be likely to release Tamar and send her to her undoing , precisely for die reasons that made him at all other times guard her so closely . Nothing would seem more natural to him than that the presence of his adored Tamar should be asked for by Amnon . He liked to believe that her purity and beauty the moral effect of her whole being , had the power to make the wrung right . the bad good , the ill well ; he himself sought out her company in his spells of despondency and unease . Then how could he be surprised that her brother should do the same when he was suffering , perhaps was in real danger , from a malady neither he nor his doctors could explain ? H INDSIGHT TEMPTS ONE to pretend to foresight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I would be lying if l stage-managed events in such a way as to make you think that I anticipated what actually happened . The truth is I /nark , no further plans . I did not really define my expectations . But I suppose I could sum them up easily enough . Mischief . Excitement . Trouble . The pleasure of instigating and observing it all and the pleasure , if possible . of getting away with it too . For my own safely I relied initially on Amnon 's pride , I might add , not his loyalty or charity . What could he say ? How much blame would he ever be able to put effectively on me ? To what end ? " Please sir . Yonadab suggested I should fall in love with my sister , so I did it . " That would n't sound very princely or heroic . It would n't be true either ; but that 's by the way . " Please sir , I fell in love with my sister , so I asked Yonadab , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should pretend to be sick and ask Tamar to he sent to me  --  which is what I did , so everything that 's happened is really his fault . " Well , that story would be a little truer than the first : but again , how shaming , holy diminishing , how comic really , is the mention such a confession would he from . " Yes , I love my sister Tamar , and would break any law , defy any puwer , overcome any difficulty , to be near her . " Or , " You can try to kill me. you can destroy my body : but it is too late , for what I 've taken from Tamar has made me immortal . beyond your touch . " Or even , " I can only pray that you , my father , and you , my dear sister Tamar , and you , my brothers , w ill wipe the evil I 've done from your memories as completely as I now wipe out my life with this single blow  --  i " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered by young lovers and rebels for ages ahead . Or so I was sure I could persuade Amnon to feel , even if I 'd had to choose one of them for him and rehearse it with him beforehand . Of course , such speeches presuppose the very worst that could happen to Amnon . But there were other possibilities , plenty of them . A clandestine affair that no one but the two of them and myself t would ever know about . No consequences at all : one huddled , desperate encounter , and a lifetime of black secrecy ( to which I Would be privy i thereafter . A runaway match . A confession to ? David , a great row , and a swift alteration of the law by David . in order to make an honest woman out of Tamar ; followed no doubt by handfuls of would-be Nathans and has-been Samuels coming to the court to prophesy woe and doom .... I must be boring you with these speculations about events that never took place . They have a certain intricate attraction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time that is never of time . Not even of the simulacrum of time in which you and I have managed to meet . T H ? . POWER OF THE Imagine the king and Amnon together in Amnon 's bedroom , their arms around one another 's necks , tears in their eyes . and pleas for forgiveness falling from their lips . They are closer to one another than they have ever been before . Why ? Because Amnon , haying gasped out that the illness he is suffering from is going to kill him land which of us can now say that he is wrong ? ) has gone on to tell the king that he is a bad son , that the king does n't know how evil he is , how rotten , how unfit to touch the king 's hand . ( And which of us would like to argue the issue with him ? Amnon 's spirit , in short . is shattered by the remorse he feels over the action he has yet to commit : and the effect of his self-abasement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't shownenough love for Amnon and enough appreciatioi of his wonderful qualities : he has n't listened care fulls enough to him : he has n't been as good , father as he should have been . Bin if only Amnoi will rally and recover , ihen there will be a new love and respect between them and they will never tool back on the failures of the past . - An affecting scene . The hairs of Amnon 's bean start out of his skin with a stiff , swooping curve , a ! if about to take off from his face altogether : hit eyes move about in starts , jumps , hops , like a pail of toads . He strokes his father 's hand and kisset it , while the king turns his head away and buries it in the crook of his free arm . It would all la ( enough to make me gush forth with tears , too , only the truths that are at last being blubbed and stammered into the air of the bedroom were not making even murkier the treachery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying there , Amnon iF not undergoing a spiritual reformation that will bring him back like the hero of a serial from the edge of the dreadful abyss into which he is about to plunge , et cetera . Far from it . In Ameon 's bulging . inflamed eyes I can see a frank astonishment and pleasure alongside the remorse he is feeling . He is amazed at his unprecedented closeness to his father : at the tenderness that has so suddenly taken the place of the surliness and irony that always spoiled their relationship before . If he and his father have reached this state merely in anticipation of the ruin of the creature his father loves best in the world , imagine what might yet pass between them after it has happened ! No , lying on his bed with his arms around his father 's shoulders . Amnon is far from giving up his scheme . Instead , between groans and shivers of the most racked , wholehearted kind , he is probably wondering why he did n't think of it before . V IL THAT IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceiving old man , as I see him : but a true figure or pattern of royalty , worthy to he Cod 's chosen and anointed one , his surrogate on earth and mankind 's great spokesman in the courts of heaven ? That is how David often thinks of himself . I know : what if David is right ? What if Amnon is not an impulsive , violent , thick-headed fellow . but the very type of the flawed hero of a classical tragedy : the man with a single weakness of will or aberration of desire that inevitably brings about his moral degeneration and death ? And what if Tamar and Absalom , too , whore you hardly know as yet , are not only wrong-headed and ill-fated , but heroic and brilliant as well ? Yes . what if all the people I have spoken of are to be remembered for their passionate fullness of life : arid not as I do , chiefly . for their confusion and absurdity ? I suspect that you have long been asking such questions of yourselves . Fair enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of a kind ) long before I had ever heard of Kant . That is , I 've always felt that one can come no closer to " the truth " about the world than one 's given faculties of mind and modes of perception permit . If I see meagerness where others see riches ; vanity where others see prowess ; meaninglessness where others see divine purpose ; theatricality and role-playing where others see fate and passion ; farce where others see tragedy  --  then that is just my bad luck , if you like , and there is no need for you to glower reproachfully at me , as though I have willfully chosen to let the side down . Yortatlab can live only in Yonadab 's world . A NINON ASKS THE KING if he may have a word with him alone . The king agrees without demur . We go out of the room , the king 's two officers and I. Not for the first time it strikes me how much of the authority of the king springs from his readiness to permit others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private . The presence of others at such times , if he chooses to have them there , is necessary to him precisely so that they may be ignored . We do not have long to wait . When the king comes out his manner is a shade less assured . But I can not read from it his mood or state of mind . Suspicion ? Puzzlement ? Irritation ? It could be any of these . I catch a single , sharp glance in my direction , as if he wonders just what my relationship to Amnon is . It is disconcerting to he the object of such a flicker of attention , when it comes from a man who has the power of life and death over you . For some reason  --  for an obvious reason remind myself , as I follow the king out of the house , that he has never indulged himself in the pastime of torturing those who have fallen out of his favor . Killing them , or tipping a wink so discreet that only the murderous sons of Zeruiah , Joab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it  --  that is his style . But ( allowing for one regrettable lapse after the capture of Rabbath-Ammon ) he has never gone in for lingering cruelties ; it is just one among the sophistications which , to his credit , he has declined to learn from our predecessors in Canaan and our neighbors to the north . It is n't for my own sake only that 1 find these reflections comforting , while I walk dutifully behind him ; I have no wish to see Amnon under the rake . The king is assisted into his covered litter . The soldiers begin to clear a way through the throng . The king 's cheek gleams red in a sudden gust of flame . through the half-open curtain of the litter ; his beard is of silver , his eyelids wearily lowered . He looks like a statue . an artifact , a painted monarch . He has not paid any attention to me since first coming out of Amnon 's room . I ask him if he wishes me to return to the palace with him . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The porters stoop , the curtains perk and are closed . The king has concluded his visit o his ailing son . The company makes its way up he cobbled lane to the palace , whose outer walls ire no more than several hundred yards away . T go rack into Amnon 's house . T HE NIGHT PASSED . I spent it with Amnon . By the time I left him in the morning , he had already bathed , changed his bedclothes , and combed his heard and hair , in anticipation of the visit which the king had promised his sister would be making to him that evening . He was excited beyond measure ; almost stupefied with impatience . But I was overcome wiils an emotion that surprised me disagreeably . It was remorse . It seemed that I resembled Amnon more than I had supposed : in itself a disagreeable discovery . He also had been afflicted with an anticipatory remorse : I had found it rather comic at the time . Now it was my turn . The whole day  --  a late summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky alternating in glares of white and yellow until it all became darker and more lurid toward sunset  --  I felt a wretched glumness that shifted about within me , as it were , but never lessened or left me . My mood was like one of those that afflict you ( that afflicted me at any rate I in adolescence , in which everything you see appears to be both the occasion for the spirit 's sadness and an expression of is . Even the stones in the ground , if you know what I mean . I ramble . But so did my thoughts . Only , at their core , never forgotten , was a point of grief , a precise sorrow . What had I done ! Why had I done it ? What malevolence within me had made it possible ? Yet nothing had happened . There was still time for me to rush over to the king and confess all . Of course , I did not do so . That was how much my remorse was worth : which merely made it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be doing ; I went from time to time to the window of my office and looked out in the direction of Amnon 's house ; I looked in the direction of the women 's quarters of the palace , where Tamar , too , was perhaps excitedly and innocently preparing herself for her evening 's expedition . She must have been very flattered when she had heard from the king how much Amnon needed her . How she would relish the role she was being asked to play ; how well it would fit in with her notion of her own importance ! Another irony . that : but it gave me no pleasure to think of it . I went back to my desk and stared at the rolls and tallies accumulated on it . shuffled them about in what I assure you was already the traditional fashion , swore absently at my scribe , and returned to the window .... I left the office early and returned to Amnon 's house . I do n't know what he 'd been doing during my absence  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , he was shiningly clean , offensively scented , combed like a horse before a big parade . The whole place was swept and aired , and there were new cloths on the tables and new hangings on the walls . Amnon was still excited and talkative , but offhand now as well . Striding and wheeling to and fro , exactly like an overfed stallion. he talked a great deal about his " illness " as if it had been a real illness of which I knew very little , if you please . He spoke with a kind of hypochondriacal pluck about how much he was looking forward to being " well " again , how much he envied people who never had Lo worry ab , at their health , how difficult it was to convey to someone like myself the anxieties and sick fancies a man could become subject to when he was " cooped up " for weeks on end . I could hardly believe my ears . Of Tamar he said not a word , When I mentioned her name , he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and affrontment , and then went on with what he 'd been talking about before . It was more than I could stand . Especially after the day of useless apprehension and regret I had been through . So it had become a piece of tactlessness on my part to mention Tamar 's name ? Was that the stage we 'd reached ? Not bloody likely . And told him so . too . The result was that we had a fierce row . At first he still tried to take a high line with me , looking haughty and indifferent . not deigning to answer my jeers and reminders of all I knew and all I had done for him . But it did n't take long to break him down . He was soon yelling at me , his face contorted , his fists clenched ; he advanced on me , thrust his face a few inches from mine , and told me that he was going to kill me. that he 'd had enough of my interference in his affairs , that he knew I 'd always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he 'd smash me . And so on . Until our anger left us both , almost as suddenh as it had come . It was followed by silence . embarrassment , unease about the threats we had just uttered , reluctance on the part of either of us to apologize to the other . I wished I were somewhere else , but found that I could not believe in the possibility of leaving . Not by any means . Not even if Amnon ordered me to , or called on his servants to throw me nut . Only then , indeed , did I realize that my desire to be in his house , to stay until Tamar arrived and as long as I could thereafter . was not so much a desire as a compulsion , an imperative that I could riot disobey . My own growing sense of ehoicelessness in the matter had been a part . I now understood , of the depression I had been feeling all day . To be present , to peep , to gloat , perhaps to let Tamar know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had previously thought of as my rewards for the work I had done , now appeared to me in the dreary aspect of so many duties which I had to carry out , irrespective of my inclinations . The fact that those duties had not long before actually been my inclinatiotis could only make them so much the more distasteful to me now . I suppose some of you will conclude that I tell you this in order to make you think better of me . You are wrong . I think rather the worse of myself , if anything , because of my inability to take pleasure in my achievement . What a typical trick it was for my psyche to play upon itself Anyhow , I 'm sure you will all understand that I was n't keen on trying to explain to Amnon the inner complexities of my attitude . Even if he 'd been able to understand me. which I doubted . he would probably not have believed me . So what to do ? Nothing . The silence prolonged itself . Finally Amnon stepped back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were safe to do so only when he wa some distance from me , he turned and went throug the arched doorway that led into an inner room and from there through a little antechamber into his bedroom . I heard him throw himself down or his bed . Presumably he had suffered a sudden re lapse in the course of that famous illness of his . stood where I was for some time , before going ti sit on a stool . Through a high , unshuttered windov I watched the slow darkening of a bruise-colorer square of light , which was all I could see of the sky Then I had an idea . I walked through to the entranc. of Amnun 's bedroom . He was lying on his back with a hand over his eves . " You know that you really want me to be hen when she comes . So why pretend otherwise ? " Amnon answered me without lifting his ham from his face . " I do n't care what you do . " It was a good enough answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . I went back to my stool in the living room . Later Amnon joined me We even managed to make a little conversation witl one another , while we waited . A BSALOM . THE GLAMOUR BOY OF THE COURT With his long hair and long legs ; his hazel eyes and broad chest ; his deep voice and self.re ? garding smile ; his way of standing with his head bent a little to one side , as if he were silently , and with becoming modesty , receiving the applause of an admiring crowd . He 'd had enough practice at it , to be sure . Forgive the malice and facetiousness of my tone . It 's a sign of embarrassment . I never found it easy to strike the right note with Absalom , or about him . I always felt uncomfortable in my dealings with him . I suppose , really , I was always a little fright . cncd of him . That feeling has n't entirely left me , it would seem , even though he is now utterly power . less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can do to him . With my tongue , at least . Frightened ? I do n't think I exaggerate . But it 's difficult to describe the quality of the fear he roused in me , or to give an adequate explanation of it . Let me put it this way . On the whole I do n't have much trouble in identifying myself temporarily , in one fashion or another , with most of the people in this story ; or at any rate , in pretending to myself that had I been given a character different from the one I actually have , or had my circumstances been different from what they actually were , I might well have felt and behaved as they did . Indeed , there are times when I suspect myself never to have beer anything more than a mind inhabited by other minds , a kind of counterfeit personality , whose abil its to manipulate others was achieved only at tht cost of , or was the direct result of , a permanent self impoverishment , a never-ending hemorrhage o , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to Absalom . Ht was alien to me , incomprehensible , always at remove . The paradox is that be appeared to me it this light not because he was so complicated , but because he was so simple . I could never figure out how he managed it . It had ( and has ) me beat . Absalom was ambitious , self-confident , vain . and idealistic ; he was always ambitious , self-confident , vain , and idealistic : he appeared to take his character or characteristics to bed with him every night and to get them up every morning unrumpled by dreams , irony , boredom , or self-doubt . I would have sworn he perspired self-confidence , pissed vanity , shat ambition , shot idealism into his women . What , I ask you , can a man like myself do with such an animal ? Except to admit that he does n't understand him and is a little afraid of him . To be tall and beautiful , to be envied , to be admired , to know that great things are expected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your gifts only for the good of others  --  what an unbeatable combination ! No wonder Absalom 's head was turned . No wonder that the crowd , the masses , the man in the street , loved hint above all the other princes ; and that he in turn was always ready to confess to a passionate admiration for the man in the street . Not as the man in the street actually was , but as he could be , one day , if he were given his chance . By Absalom , among others . For Absalom was  --  excuse me  --  a progressive . He was a hater of injustice . An enemy of established authority of every kind , not least that of his father and the priests . A friend of the poor . A bold planner of schemes for the redistribution of land , new codes of law , new methods of government . A maximizer of happiness . A firm believer in the future which would surely see all these things come in pass . Indeed . what made him above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the future he was so dedicated to would somehow retrospectively balance up or cancel out all the evils and pains of the past ; it would give meaning to them , prove : hem to have been ultimately worthwhile . It goes dmost without saying that that would apply in paricular to any evils Absalom himself might have to : ommit in order to bring the future about , This was a point of view I could never begin to inderstand. quite candidly . It seems more than ever senseless to me now that I stand here , divided from ' ou and united to you by all the time that has passed ince Absalom 's death and my own . Do not flatter ' ourselves , my dears , that anything you do will liminish by one iota the pains we felt when we vere able to . Do not imagine that generations suceeding yours will be able to redeem you from your ailures and misfortunes . Take it from me : each , f us bears his own burden forever . For as much of orever as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything is ready for I her ; just as it was  --  just as it has to be  --  the - turning after the rape . Here is Absalom , standing 1 the street outside the gate to his house . Here is to mob that has been following her about . And ere I am , keeping within earshot but hanging well ack , with my cloak about my face . Tamar sees we are all in position and waiting for her . Amnon , she then declaims , has raped her . He had pretended to be ill and had asked the king to send her to him , to prepare food for him ; once she was in his house he had dismissed his servants and bolted the door ; he had then assaulted her he had held her prisoner throughout the night ; he had assaulted her repeatedly . She had begged and pleaded to be released : she had warned him to let her go ; she had reminded him who she was and who he was ; she had called on God , on the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save her . Nothing had helped . In the morning he had thrown her out of the house , he had called his servants and told them to turn her into the street as she was , as Absalom now saw her , as the whole city had seen her . Yes , the whole city , through which she had just made her way : exposed . undone , a spectacle to them all . She had no secrets from the mob now . Then let there be no secrets between themselves and the mob if Absalom should choose to turn her away . She could not enter his house until she had told him all that happened to her : before she passed through his door she had to give him the choice of accepting or rejecting her . Let Absalom look at her before he spoke : let him ask himself if he was still ready to acknowledge his kinship to her arid to give shelter to a creature who would never be anything but a reminder of the vileness of which she had been victim . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open his house to her . There were stones enough in Jerusalem to dash out her brains ; high places enough for her to leap from : deserts close enough in which she could perish from hunger and thirst : wild dogs and leopards enough to tear her limbs apart : tribesmen enough to carry her across the river as their slave . Thus  --  more or less  --  Tamar to Absalom . Having been unable to tell her story to her hither , she has chosen to make what you might vulgarly call a big production of her confrontation with Absalom . By insisting ( solely in order to give him a free choice in the matter , of course ) that he come out to her in the street , she has secured the services of an audience of several hundred extras : and her rhetoric is directed toward them quite as much as toward Absalom . Yet you would be mistaken if you should therefore conclude that her hyperbolic words and histrionic gestures are necessarily insincere ; and that , if she were put to it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deserts , and so forth . Such high-flown display is now the only mode of self-expression open to hem she can adopt no other . Equally , you would not he mistaken in suspecting her of having made it very difficult for Absalom to do anything but lead her into his house and give her the shelter and comfort she earnestly proclaims she is ready to do without . Cunning Tamar. daughter of David ! How intricate sincerity can be among those who have a genuine gift for it ! Your ordinary hypocrite , like my father . does n't stand a chance among such people . Absalom himself would be at-together outclassed , were it not that he has a gift of his own which serves him quite as well as his sister 's sincerity serves her ; he has his vanity . So when he finally stirs from the shocked impassivity with which he has listened to her , vaguely and doubtfully frowning , like a blind man with his face turned toward the sun  --  when he stirs , he goes directly to what he , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does the king knew all this ? " " No . I 've come straight to you . " Absalom breathes in deeply . " Why ? " It is as if he is prompting her . She is quick to take up the cue . " Because you 're my brother . my only real brother . Because if you do n't give me shelter , no one will . Because the whole world knows you to be a man who protects the poor and friendless . Because you can plead for me before the king . Because you are Absalom . Because I love you . " Absalom considers her reply for a long time , in silence , and finds it satisfactory . He does not speak . He simply extends his hand to her . He has not disowned her . She is =till his sister . Tamar bows to hint . The mob murmurs its approbation and excitement . Throughout , Absalom has looked only at her ; from the way he has carried himself he might be alone with her in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to see himself , without misgiving or reservation , as he is determined the watching crowd shall see him : as a man of ruth and power . And of passion and pride . too . His hare arms are about her shoulders , the frown on his brow has contracted and deepened , he stands motionless , waiting for the full meaning of all she has told him to penetrate him . to strike root in him : and then to begin drawing him into itself . Drawing his anger and strength ; his love for her and his ambitions for himself : all he has taken for granted in the past and will never be able to take for granted again . Even his beauty and the grace of his movements , without which he would not be Absalom , are drawn too . visibly altered by the ugliness that has been planted within him ; not lessened , but made purer , more tense , sadder . His shoulders swell , he lifts his face from her hair , his lips move . We can not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamar looks up suddenly in surprise , and then lowers her gaze and comes closer yet to him . Perhaps he is uttering words of encouragement to her . or endearments , or promises of revenge : perhaps he is praying for her ; perhaps he is simply raving , repeating Aninon 's name like a curse . Involuntarily we draw- closer . Our eager , nervous shuffle forward does not escape Absalom . He at once raises his voice , though he still looks straight at Tamar and appears to direct his words only to her . What he says is disconnected and riddling , made up of so many bursts of phrases delivered in a menacingly level tone ; its logic is wholly that of his self-regard , which he believes to be identical with the regard we have for him . He can not permit the injury Amnon has done to his sister , and hence to himself , to be thought of as anything less than anoutrage , an act of sacrilege ; he can not admit before us that a miserable creature like Amnon has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But Absalom resolves it , after a fashion . " No one can harm you , Tamar . You 're the princess , my sister , we 're one family , parts of one another , we ca n't hurt each other without hurting ourselves ... Amnon will learn just how badly he 's hurt himself , you need n't worry about that . Leave it to me . I 'll do whatever 's necessary to be done ... If you were a beggar woman I 'd take care of you , so how could you think that I 'd turn you away ? My sister ! And Amnon dared to do it to you ! ... You are right to have gone through the streets , showing yourself to anyone who wanted to look at you . It 's Amnon you were showing them , not yourself . We can not be shamed by him . But we can shame him . We can do more than that , too , and we will ... Now put it out of your mind , do n't think about it anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one who 'll remember it : me and our blucher , Amnon . " For the first time Absalom addresses us directly . " Do you hear ? " he shouts angrily at us . " I 'm the only one who 'll remember any of this . Clear off ! All of you ! At ortre ! There 's nothing more for you to stare at ! " He turns toward the gate of his house , Tamar following him . But we do n't obey his command to disperse until his men close the gate behind the two of them , and advance on us . Then , promptly , we scatter . A QUITE DIFFERENT GROUP ASSEMBLES in tht throne room for the regular session of Bic council , some hours later . The only member com mon to the two groups , I am sure , is myself . By now it seems that practically everyone in the court , with-the exception of David himself , has heard of tht catastrophe that has befallen his daughter . No on ( as yet has dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't yet arrived . Judging from an look on his face and his manner of fingering tht hilt of his sword , I would say that even the young est officer on duty has heard of the scandal which- is about to break . and is haying vivid fantasies o being called upon to do more than ceremonial clinic today : he sees himself making arrests , carrying ou summary executions , pursuing fugitives . The res of us are a little more restrained . None of us says . word of what is uppermost in our minds : but wit ! many specious nods and wrinklings of our fort heads , much play with the corners of our mouth : meaningful movements of our eyes , twitches of ou shoulders and brings of our fingers , while we e ) change our greetings and commonplaces about th weather , we signal to one another that we are full in the know theaven forbid , for the sake of ou reputations as men of affairs that we should n't he ) and that we are deeply apprehensive of what is abut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also goes without saying . At last the king arrives . He looks as he did th last time we saw him here : small , bright , in con 66 mand , his alertness tinctured to just the right degree with indifference , his aloofness with fatigue . On his way to the throne he pauses to greet some of the people who are stepping back and bowing to him , and his inquiries after their welfare appear all the more good-natured and considerate precisely because they are so perfunctory , those of a man with much more important things on his mind . He takes his place on the throne and smooths down his robes before the page on duty can do it for him . The princes who are in the room draw closer to him , their eyes enormous with their unspoken news , their lips trembling with the effort to contain it . Ira steps forward with a scroll in his hand , on which is inscribed today 's order of business . We sigh , but not out of boredom . The king 's entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so irrevocable . We are in for it now , and so is he . Suddenly we find our-wives w ishing we were somewhere else . Ira begins to read from the scroll . His voice pavers . Is it his duty as chief minister , seeing that none of the princes have spoken , to tell the king what has happened to his daughter ? There is nothing of the slightest importance on the scroll : but he old man draws out the reading of it intcrminibly , partly because he wants to delay coining to its end , partly because he ca n't help stumbling . losing his place , staring down in blank silence at the iocument in his hand . David is puzzled , but patient . fra looks up , the scroll drops from his hand , his face puckers , it seems to strive toward an expres ; ion  --  an order  --  it can not attain . " My lord ? " he wys hopelessly . A movement at the door . Absalom enters . The a hole room knows it at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks across the oom , above our heads , straight at David . It is obious to him that the king knows nothing : if he lid , he would not be where he is. and nor would we . Absalom 11 ails before speaking . His voice is calm not resolute . He addresses the king directly . " I have had news for you . " L OVE AND HATRED have grown together , they wear the same expression , they make demands that an never he fulfilled in order to justify their an-:lent rages . David has loved his children exorbiantly , gluttonously , with passions that have over , vhelmed him and have yet been his instruments , ablegations that have swollen his pride , generosities hat have crushed their recipients . What is he to lo , now lie has heard that the son to vi limn he gave ; o much of himself at their last meeting has violated he daughter he has always adored ? Whom is he o blame , now he has learned that in lavishing ten-Iciness and prayer over Amnon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He blames himself , of course . Amnon. as well , 3ut he blames Tamar most of all . How unjust , you want to cry out . tThat 's what many of us in the throne room want to cry out , too . I You are right and so are we . But we know that avid has not become king and ruler over usthrough a strict , undeviating regard for justice ; his attachment to it has never been stronger than his attachment to himself , his career , his power , his political skills , his prestige . He has always been prepared to cut his losses : he has never allied himself to defeat . Least of all has he allied himself to his own defeats . Tamar has been ruined : he was tricked and fooled into contributing to her ruin : she is therefore doubly a source of discredit to him : he will have no more to do with her . The logic of his response is merciless and irresistible ; and once lie has adopted it , his love for her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guilt for what he did the night before  --  can only make his repudiation of her fiercer . He must see a premonition of disaster as the very deepest of the feelings he had always had about her . She had been beyond his keeping , his regard for her had always included an element of despair . So it is even possible for him to greet the news with cries of pain that sound strangely akin to those of relief : at least he knows now what it was he had so much dreaded in the past . Yet you must not misunderstand me . David does not blame Tamar for having been ravished . He may be intolerably cunning and devious , he may grope unerringly through the darkness of his own soul toward the personal supremacy he can not live without , but he is n't mad . he is n't a fool , he does n't pretend that she could have led on Amnon , as some imbeciles around the palace have already shown themselves ready to believe . David does n't need to follow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him than the fact that  --  disgraced  --  she is not present , he has n't seen her . she has become an abstraction to him : and by her own choice . She has turned away from him . It is fur that that he blames her , and will never be able to forgive her . She has gone to Absalom . To Absalom . who has given his own meaning , the king is sure , to her choice . To Absalom , who brings him bad news like a challenge : and then stands before him , declaring in every word and gesture , as David interprets them , that he is incapable of meeting the challenge . David : " And you come and yell out these things in my council chamber , in front of the whole court ! Could n't you think what they would mean to me ? Could n't you speak to me alone before telling the whole world ? " Absalom : " There is n't a soul here who did n't know all about it before I spoke . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look from the one to the other of us , accusing us in his glance of being cow ards , liars , keepers of secrets from him . But he does not do it . Instead , he reads into what Absalom has said an implication we would never have dared to find . " So I 'm finished , am I ? An old man whom no one bothers to keep informed ? They must go to you , they must wait for you . Everyone must run to you , as Tamar has done . " " You have said it , not me . " Provoking the reactions which transform each previous misunderstanding into a trash , the two are able to use each other , turn arid turn about , as stepping-stones toward the adoption of finally intransigent and irreconcilable positions . We all know how such a process works ; we have all been actively involved in it at one time or another . What would any of our institutions , from marriage to diplomacy , be without it ? We stand in the council chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to carry on important business of the state ; nevertheless we are like children watching their parents quarrel over the dinner table ; like children we are frightened and fascinated by what we witness , foreseeing in it the destruction of our house and the overthrow of the security we have known . David and Absalom , father and son , princely politicians and leaders of men , bring to the task all the energy and misguided acumen at their command . Each can not tell his own or the other 's claims from denials , disavowals from accusations , affirmations from attacks . Even titles or appellations become a ground of conflict between them . If Absalom calls Tamar ' ' my sister " he is disputing David 's right to call her his daughter ; if David calls her " your sister " he is pretending that Absalom has wrested from him what he is anxious to surrender , or has already irresponsibly turned adrift , left with no protector but Absalom . When Absalom demands justice he is impudently trying to arrogate to himself the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege then Absalom knows that justice will not be done , for justice belongs to no man . not even to the king , but to the community beyond him and greater than him , which the king must serve . Inevitably , the angrier the king is with Absalom . the less inclined he is to turn his wrath against Amnon , if only because Absalom wants him to . And though Absalom speaks of the duties of the king , the authority of the state . the w ill of the people . dre protection of the helpless , the judgment of posterit ? such phrases come readily to Absalom 's lips , even when he is as moved as he is now  --  it is to the single issue of the punishment of Annum that David reduces all Absalom 's invocations . In David 's eyes Amnon is guilty , there is no question about it . But he will not say , he will not even hint , what penalty he will exact for the crime ; or whether Amnon will have to suffer any penalty other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the king 's evasiveness , is driven for the first time to make explicit his ultimate demand . " Amnon must be punished according to the law , like anyone else . ' A man who uncovers his sister 's nakedness shall be cut off in the sight of the people ' : that 's what the law lays down . I insist that the law be carried out . For my sister 's sake I demand my brother 's death . " David leans back in his chair and answers quietly , " So that you will have one less rival for my throne . " At last that , too , has been said : it has been made plain what is at stake between them . Now we understand David 's movement in the chair , before he spoke . He is challenging Absalom to oust him from it , if lie can . Absalom cries out , " Think what you are saying ! " David does not answer , and Absalom plunges forward to meet the charge . " Amnon will never sit in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly . " " And how much longer will you occupy the throne if you refuse to carry out the law ? Think what you are doing ! If the king is n't bound by the law , then who is ? Why should anyone in this room obey the law , if he sees that it means nothing to the king ? Why should you have the power to jail a thief or hang a traitor ? Who is the traitor when the king betrays the laws  --  the king , or the man who overthrows him ? Do n't you understand , there can be no end to what you 're beginning . You leave us no alternative . " " To ' chat ? " Absalom is n't afraid to say the words : " Rebellion , Upheaval . " Nor is the king upset by them . " And all out of your love of law and order ? " " No , out of my love for my justice , which is more important to use than either . " Absalom 's arguments arc the stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to become weaker and weaker , the longer the dispute between them continues . Not only because he is appealing for harshness while David , whatever his reasons may be , is on the side of clemency : nor because David has made suspect Absalom 's motives in demanding Amnon 's death ; nor even because David has the power , with a beck of the head , to have Absalom arrested for seditious talk , so that the clemency he is objecting to when applied to another is helping him too . All these demonstrate but do not define David 's readiness to follow his ow n judgment , no matter how perverse or cruel it may he , as to what will best serve him ; his confidence in his right to be moved or not , as he pleases , by the logical strength of an argument , or by the threatening tone in which it is couched , or by the expectations which others have of him , or by the commitments of his own past . But what has such a display of self-will to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate between them ? To Absalom . nothing . To David , everything . Which is in itself another way of describing . David 's power . He knows that unreason and fatality have always been among the forces through which he has worked and which have worked upon him , and he accepts that it should he so ; Absalom does not . Therefore , it is Absalom who appears vain , shallow , self-obsessed. bloodthirsty , bemused by abstractions ; while David , in his unmoving ivory throne , rides upon the very crest of that tidal equipoise between the violence of law and the violence of lawlessness , which we call peace and sovereignty . It is faith , not expediency , which is David 's last resource : faith in the power which has given him his power . He prays to it , he governs his polity by it , he knows the order and anarchy of the universe to depend upon it . But I 've already used too many words to describe something that is plain to the simplest person in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jet me , looking around at the assembled courtiers , charitably grant him that much ) ; nevertheless , he chooses to take that exacting role upon himself . He appeals to his brothers to help him make the king do his duty : he warns them that if Amnon 's crime goes . unpunished then they too will be in danger , for Amnon will feel himself free to commit any crime imaginable against any of the king 's children : he reminds them of the disrespect the family will fall into if it becomes known abroad not only that such a crime has been committed , but that it has had no consequences , been treated as a trifle . " You think our neighbors are in any position to disapprove ? With their habits ? " David puts in sardonically at that point . He has sunk farther into his chair , and protruded his head a little , lizard-like both in his posture and in the unblinking silence of the gaze he has fixed on Absalom . Absalom 's arguments are valid and unavailing . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to the king , as if he were indeed their leader , and had rimed to cry out only after he had spoken  --  those brothers of his now simply do n't want to listen to him . Some of them gesture to him surreptitiously , others actually interrupt him . They want him to shut up , to leave it alone . This is n't the time or the place for what he is saying ; he is n't helping anyone : let them consider it all later or in private : let the whole unhappy meeting come to its end . " I would never , never have believed it . ' , ' Absalom finally exclaims . " That I 'd have to plead that a man who did such a thing to our sister should get the punishment he deserves ? ! " He looks about him , and what he sees in our faces discourages and baffles him further . Only the thought of Tamar herself gives him the strength to turn once more to the king and say his last words to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . She is my sister , and a princess , and she will know how to behave toward a father who treats her as you have . " David is silent : for a moment unable to move . Then he rouses himself . To Ira 's surprise , to the surprise of us all , he calls the chancellor . " You had n't finished . There are matters that , 1 must be attended to . We have work to do . " Who can tell how much it may have cost him to give that order ; and then to sit on the throne , listening , nodding his head occasionally , speaking when he has to , while the tedious affairs of the day are despatched . Still , he does it ; and what 's more , he does it in a manner which suggests that he is making the effort as much for Absalom 's sake as for his own . He is trying to save him from further humiliation and self-exposure : he is giving him time to recover . Absalom is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone to leave the throne room before the king , and for all his talk of rebellion just a few minutes previously , he can not bring himself to break the tradition . Instead , he stands with hisarms folded and a look of contempt and outrage on his face , waiting for the moment of release . David will not give it to him . On his way out of the room he stops in front of Absalom . For the onlooker , certainly for David himself , there is pathos in the disparity in height between them ; in the difficulty he has in putting his hand on his son 's shoulder . - Absalom , " he says , issuing the order in a suddenly tremulous , beseeching voice , " you will dine with me . We will talk of other things . There are other subjects we can talk about . " T IM DAY CONTINUES . The same day still , is it ? It must he . I can hardly remember when it began ; I have had no sleep : it seems years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . We had drunk wine , I recall , the memory corning to me as if from another world ; we had quarreled : later on we had talked ; then Tamar had arrived . Nothing had yet happened that would need to be remembered by any of us ; nothing that would cause us to he remembered by others . Then , when all had been anticipation , not deed , there had still been a chance of the day being assumed into that eternity of the nondescript which is perhaps the truest eternity we shall ever attain ; the moments when history is made or fame secured being no more than intrusions and interruptions into eternity , fractures of it , and never , as we like to suppose , its fulfillment among us . Not for the first time it occurs to me that we are most closely bound to eternity when we carry out those actions to which we attach least importance : when we yawn , or scratch ourselves , or blink in a sudden blaze of sunlight , or take out our cocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen absently to the conversation of bores . For then we are truly indistinguishable from one another ; your nervous system is as mine ; there is neither succession nor precession ; only our shared , timeless commonalty . Today , as on any other , I yawn , scratch myself , piss , I blink in the sunlight when I come out of the palace . But I also make my way to Amnon 's house , to see what he is doing and to hear what he has to say . I have to . The day , that has already gone on for so long , is not like any other . It is set apart ; and so are those of us who have allowed ourselves to be caught withinit . For the first Lime I have a vivid intimation of what that might mean . For the first time , with a mixture of sick apprehension and excitement , I see myself here , always here , always before you , condemned to remember , explain , present and comment upon actions I can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , not long before , been entitled . I FIND AMNON TO BE DEPRESSED . He is also ex- hausted , naturally enough , after such a night . Even I , %%Ito  --  shall I say ? ? exerted my-self so much less than he , am feeling oddly detached and weightless for lack of sleep ; only my itchy eyes seem definitely to belong to me.1 Before coming to the house I had expected to hear abuse and reproaches , ravings against myself and Tamar . I was wrong . He is so depressed he . Can hardly open his mouth . He is fully clothed , but he shows no sign of being about to go out : indeed , he does n't stir from the chair in which he sits , his legs splayed out in front of him . his hands hanging down between them , his chin either sunk against his chest or pointing toward the ceiling , apparently unable to hold any position between . His greeting had been a single sideways slide of his eyes ; a shake of his head his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total immobility his response to my innocent wonder if his night with Tamar had " come up to expectations . " 1I 'd chosen the phrase with some care , on my way to his house from the palace . We sit together without speaking for some time . Amnon appears to fall asleep , twitches suddenly with his feet and shoulders , and is awake again . At least I see his black eyelashes flickering . " So what happened ? " I demand finally , like the bluff . forthright friend whose tones 1 have decided it would be best for me to adopt . Amnon does n't answer at once . But it is not because he is weighing his words so scrupulously . His chin tilted ceilingward , he says , " Nothing . " " Nothing ? What do you mean ? " But he merely repeats the word . " Nothing . " " You mean you just let her go ? " - No . " " Then what did you do ? " " Nothing . " " That 's not what Tamar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I had n't intended uttering quite so soon , has little effect on Amnon . " Then you know what happened , " he merely says . " Why do you bother me about it ? " " It 's true . then , is it ? " " You should know . " I try again . " Tamar went to Absalom . She did n't go hack to the palace . Absalom told the king about it . Everyone knows by 11411,5 ; the whole city . " " I thought I heard more people than usual in the street outside , " Amnon remarks indifferently . " They must be waiting for something to happen . " " They are . I had to push my way through them to get here . " His head sinks down , his lips pout further forward , he rubs his hands vaguely together , and then desists , as if even that effort is too much for him . " What are you going to do ? " l ask . " About the people outside ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About David . About Absalom . About the whole business . You 've got to do something . " " Why ? " " Well , you were certainly energetic enough in getting yourself into trouble , were n't you ? " " I know . That was the mistake I made . Look , " he adds , surprising me with the sudden vigor of his tone , " I 'm sorry fur Tamar . I 'm sorry I ever hurt her . I was mad . I see it now . But she 's mad , AUGUST WO toot to think it matters . It does n't . We make up rules , and then we make up emotions to go with them . It 's nonsense . If we had other rules we 'd have the same emotions about different things . That 's all there is to it . " Amnon , the philosopher . Amnon , the quietist . Amnon. the stoic acceptor of the miseries he 's inflicted on others . It 's enough to turn one 's stomach . However , I take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the emotions anyway , then perhaps that 's precisely why they do matter . Why they must matter . " His vigor has left him as abruptly as it came . " You think so ? " he asks , without curiosity . " What else is there ? " " Nothing . Death . " One of the things that most irritates me about our exchange is that I do n't have to come to Amnon in order to ask such questions and to hear such replies : I could always stay at home and commune with myself for five minutes . Yet his last words have made me suddenly vigilant . Coiled motionlessly within my impatience , like the vivid , immaculate twist of color inside a glass marble , is the answer to a problem which has been worrying me for longer than I have suspected . After all , I have just come from a room where I have heard death , his death , being treated as a possibility , a matter of choice ; and now he too has spoken of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his sandaled feet and hanging hands , I feel I have never been closer to him or more detached from him : he has ceased to be human and has already become no more than a rock face confronting me , a tree , a body of water , an object , any natural phenomenon which I ran examine but which can not examine me . I am unable to withdraw . I have interfered so much , used the only kind of power I have to such effect , I must now continue to the end . There can he no end other than the one he has just named . Call me an artist , if you like . I wo n't take it as a compliment . Any more than I will take it as an insult if you call me a pathologically malicious and meddlesome busybody who is compelled to make up for his own emotional vacuity by manipulating the passions and lives of others . Either way , I have to see my oeuvre completed , given its inevitable , final shape ; the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking , though it eludes each of them on his own . How penurious our imaginations are ! How limited our ingenuities ! There is no need for me to talk of Osiris and Isis , of Baal and Anat , of Tammuz and Inannalshtar : brothers and sisters , lovers in their season , explorers of the underworld of darkness and disintegration . I 'd do just as well to speak to you of a wolf that lay in bed and pretended to be sick , like Amnon , until there came to him a i pretty virgin with a gift of food , like Tamar . Then the wolf sprang on Little Red Riding Hood and devoured her . Now the wolf must die . The wolf himself says so . The wolf says there is nothing else . The wolf is looking for his death . Absalom , woodman , shepherd , rebellious son , you can sharpen your ax . ?
