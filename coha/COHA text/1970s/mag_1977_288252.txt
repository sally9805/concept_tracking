In Gorky , Soviet Christians cry out for more churches Marxism may teach that religion must wither away , but the state is forever trying to help the process along . Though the new constitution , like the old , " recognizes " religious liberty in the U.S.S.R. , the government decides exactly how many churches can stay open . Today there are only 7,500 Russian Orthodox churches , a tenth as many as before the 1917 Revolution , and 1,000 of these are not , in fact , in operation . <P> Particularly hard hit has been Gorky , a city on the Volga River about the size of Buffalo , N.Y . Gorky has only three small Orthodox churches in outlying areas to serve an estimated 150,000 active communicants . Last month , with considerable courage , 1,700 people signed a petition asking the regime to reopen one of Gorky 's 100 or so closed churches ; many are now in use as bakeries , museums or warehouses . According to the petition , the Gorky churches are so crowded on Sundays that their congregations overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The believers pledged to use their own money and labor for renovations . Even so , prospects look dim . " They 're afraid that if they open a church for us , they 'll have to start opening churches all across the country , " said Petition Organizer Benjamin Kozulin . Attempts are made to gather signatures in church grounds , but church employees who owe their jobs to the government break up the crowds and chase away the petitioners . When Kozulin and fellow church members made a similar effort a decade ago , he was threatened with imprisonment in a lunatic asylum and nine organizers lost their jobs . <P> Baptists in Bryansk , 250 miles southwest of Moscow , face a like problem . They had managed to acquire local approval to build a new prayer chapel , but last month the government suddenly halted construction . When a large group conducted a protest sit-in at the site , police and soldiers assaulted some 150 members of the congregation . The unusual incidents in Gorky and Bryansk , and repeated articles in Soviet journals lamenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity is not vanishing . It may be gaining spiritual ground .
