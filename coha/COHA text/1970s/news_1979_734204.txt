txt Saudi Arabia is eager to continue to improve its close relationship with the United States , but that relationship is likely to undergo some basic changes . Informants close to the Saudi leadership report that King Khalid 's government is anxious for Americans to understand these changes . They are likely to be heralded by the departure from power of figures associated with " pro-American " policies such as Sheikh Ahmed Zaki al-Yamani , the Oil Minister . ( Mr. Yamani told newsmen at his daughter 's graduation from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania May 13 that Americans had been warned of impending gasoline shortages " six months ago . " These would get worse " as long as you keep consuming more , " because oil producers could not increase supplies , he said . The Oil Minister also visited Washington May 14 to lecture on Islamic law , his professional specialty . ) Adoption of a new budget and Cabinet changes following it are likely to confirm the new trends in Saudi policy : 1 . Saudi Arabia can not and will not continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Mr. Yamani 's Oil Ministry has announced it will continue to apply its self-imposed ceiling of 8.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) during 1980 . Any decision to increase this " will have to be taken at least six months in advance ... except in emergency cases , " the ministry said . Although Sheikh Yamani got royal consent to boost production temporarily to 9.5 million bpd or more after the Iranian shortfall last winter , this is unlikely to happen again . A new cutoff of Iranian production , possibly this summer , will require the US and other Saudi customers to look elsewhere // From page .1 Saudis decide to be firm with US on oil 2 . What the Saudis regard as clumsy and ill-informed US pressure to get them to support the March 26 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and to continue financial support of President Sadat of Egypt will get the US nowhere . Although Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal is expected to replace Mr. Yamani as oil minister , a new foreign minister will not change basic Saudi foreign policy . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It totally rejects any Middle East solution not including a return of East Jerusalem to Arab control and creation of a homeland , if not a state , for the Palestinian Arabs . Since the Saudis do not consider that the Egyptian-Israeli " autonomy " talks on the future of the occupied West Bank and Gaza have any real intent except perpetuation of Israeli settlement and control , they will not support them . Most financial aid to Egypt is being cut , in conformity with recent pan-Arab decisions at Baghdad , Iraq . The Saudis announced cancellation May 14 of the $1.5 billion Arab Industrial Organization ( AIO ) under which British and French interests , with Saudi and gulf Arab funds , were building a major arms-production complex in Egypt . American Motors of the US was participating in AIO with the production of Jeeps . Former Saudi intelligence chief Kamal Adham lost his post , partly because he was thought , rightly or wrongly , to be facilitating continued " under the table " aid to Egypt . The Saudis , however , do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that the US , as architect of the separate Egyptian-Israeli peace , will feel honor-bound to make up to Mr. Sadat the loss of Arab financial support . This would entail aid far beyond even the extra $2.5 billion or so over the next three years now being considered by the US Congress for Egypt . Crown Prince Fand denied charges by President Sadat May 13 that Saudi Arabia planned to buy French Mirage 2000 fighters instead of US F-15s , the British Broadcasting Corporation reported May 14 . Contributions sought President Sadat also asked the American people to finance with voluntary contributions a $527 million sale of Northrop F-5 fighters to Egypt , because , he claimed , the Saudis would renege on their promise to pay for them . US officials say the F-5 situation is not clear . Meanwhile , Saudi military leaders reportedly are starting to be disenchanted with what one source termed a " Maginot Line " of huge but possibly useless military defense complexes , like a $15 billion desert military city under construction at Batten , near the Iraqi frontier , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manpower and training shortages are such that a 19-ship navy , on order from the US , would , if completed today , have fewer than 50 well-trained officers to man it or to run the multibillion-dollar Jubeil naval base . The United States , says one informant , sought to divert Saudi energies and attention away from Israel by encouraging such huge complexes instead of helping the Saudis develop meaningful strategic defense plans or train them for the light , ride-by-night mobile desert guerrilla warfare in which historically they have excelled . 3 . Reports of grave health problems and serious rivalry between the top members of the Saudi royal family are exaggerated . King Khalid and Crown Prince Fand have long been known to have such problems , but King Khalid is neither interested in abdicating nor planning to do so . Prince Fand and the Sudeiry family , which includes the pro-US Defense and Aviation Minister , Prince Sultan ( whose job is not threatened ) , have reached complete agreement with Prince Abdallah , who is Second Deputy Prime Minister , National Guard commander , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shomar family , on policy and on the crucial succession issue . Abdallah in line Prince Abdallah is clearly designated as the next crown prince ; the Sudeirys have accepted this . Prince Abdallah , whose sentiments are Arab nationalist and who has especially good ties with Iraq , is emerging more and more as " strong man . " The last US Central Intelligence Agency station chief was asked by the Saudis to leave because he probed insistently into these matters . Saudi policy will increasingly be determined by the strong combination of Prince Sultan ( who has especially good ties with the US ) and Prince Abdullah ( who has the better Arab ties of the two ) . Soviet wooing 4 . Last winter 's quiet flirtation with the Soviet Union , initiated by the latter with a view to finally establishing diplomatic relations , has been cooled down by King Khalid and Prince Fand . However , Soviet trade missions may soon visit Riyadh , the Saudi capital , for the first time with a view to oil purchases . The first arrivals of Soviet-bloc tankers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters before the end of this year . Diplomatic relations might then not be far behind , especially if the Saudis consider that the US is continuing to try to pressure them away from close alignment with the other Arab and Muslim states .
