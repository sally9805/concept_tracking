EZRA POUND IN ITALY : FROM THE PISAN CANTOS <P> Edited by Gianfranco Ivancich ; Photographs by Vittorugo Contino Rizzoli ; 136 pages ; $27.50 <P> This book arrives like a packet of snapshots long lost in the mail . In 1968 , some four years before his death , Poet Ezra Pound agreed to accompany an Italian photographer on a tour of the locales that had inspired him during the writing of the Pisan Cantos 23 years earlier . The freedom to roam was ironic , for when Pound had composed these poems he had not been free to travel anywhere . He was incarcerated in the U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center in Pisa , charged with treason for making speeches over Rome radio in support of Mussolini 's regime . For the first three weeks of his imprisonment , Pound , then 59 , was kept in a small outdoor cage with a cement floor , free only to watch the Pisan clouds by day and " O moon my pin-up " at night . Improbably , some of his greatest poetry flowered there and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The pictorial record of Pound 's unsentimental journey through old memories and older landmarks makes for intriguing viewing on several levels . First there are the sites themselves . Although a few of his shots smack of artiness , Photographer Vittorugo Contino is usually content to let Pisa , Verona and especially the stones of Venice speak for themselves . His black-and-white photography starkly captures the Venetian redolence of intrigue , history and decay . <P> Next there are the accompanying excerpts and snippets from the Pisan Can tos , reproduced in Pound 's handwriting . Good poetry should stand on its own feet , but Pound 's presents a special case . Although as a young man he campaigned tirelessly for the sharpest possible image expressed in the fewest possible words , his later poems grew increasingly allusive , personal and cryptic . Images were still present but encoded . Seeing what Pound saw before it filtered through his mind helps break that code . Sometimes the pictures simply amplify the words . Two pages of dark , roiling skyscape follow lines on Pisan 's " undoubtedly various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic sight helps explain a sound . A line like " Can Grande 's grin like Tommy Cochran 's " is meaningless without the knowledge that Tommy Cochran was " a kid " Pound knew as a youth , and without an image of the statue Can Grande della Scala in Verona . The statue and the grin are here . <P> Finally there are the rare , unsettling views of Pound himself . Unlike Yeats , Joyce and Eliot , the great modernists whom he coached and championed , Pound never prepared a public face . Even at 83 , he remained unsmiling and ill at ease in front of the camera , although he had come to look like the personification of an aging bard . His unruly hair had whitened into a mane , and his face bore lines and wrinkles beyond the mere ravages of time . In " Hugh Selwyn Mauberley " ( 1920 ) Pound had praised " the obscure reveries of the inward gaze . " As these pictures prove , it became his characteristic expression .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
