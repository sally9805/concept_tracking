POLITICIANS HAVE MANY VIRTUES that ignorant people take for vices . The principal ones are : ( 1 ) compromise of principle ; ( 2 ) egotism ; ( 3 ) mediocrity . In other men these may he vices ; but for a politician they are needed skills ? so much so that , if a politician is not born with them , he must learn them ; and if he does not learn them , he will either fail himself or do harm to others , as Eugene McCarthy did . McCarthy could compromise , but preferred not to , believing himself bound to the illusion of principle . A real politician must not only compromise ? we all do that ? lie must positively prefer compromise to the indulgence of any opinion , even his own . McCarthy was not egotistical but proud . Pride digs in its heels ; it offends against the first virtue of compromise . Egotism , on the other hand , is flexible ; relaxes to the tickle of acclaim ; seeks polymorphous cosseting ; is easy of access . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McCarthy , though not a great poet , is not a terribly bad poet , which tempted him to decline the honor of mediocrity . Terribly bad poets are allowed in politics . Their poetry is just another form of egotism , an exercise and confirmation of the second necessary virtue . There is in Baltimore a city comptroller , Hyman Pressman , who has made a long and useful political career of his terribly bad poetry . He could never be suspected of excellence , while McCarthy constantly raised just those suspicions . The suspicions were never confirmed , but their very presence was enough to doom him . People do not like to be ruled by their superiors . They will settle for their equals , but prefer their inferiors . They like to feel they are too smart to be deceived by a politician ; so , just to be safe , they choose politicians too dumb to deceive them . We wrong politicians when we attack them for qualities that serve us and adorn them , qualities only acquired with labor and exercised with diligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we elect men who possess them . Yet we refuse to give them the serious and admiring attention they deserve . I would like to remedy this , giving each virtue its due regard . Compromise of principle 0 F COURSE THERE ARE OCCASIONS when a politician must compromise , and therefore does . So do we all . There are even more occasions for necessary compromise in politics than in most pursuits ( except marriage ) . Every man does what he must . The real test of a politician comes when he does not have to compromise , yet finds a way to do so . Each time a politician indulges his or anyone else 's single opinion or principle , he loses an opportunity to ingratiate himself with those who hold different views or standards ? a criminal waste . Even when a politician does not have to defer to any opinion but his own , he can do so , and sheer economy demands that he seek out unnecessary compromises . Consider . By the accumulation of compromises , concentric circles of people are , with varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built into the dynamics of election . In this way the politician got disparate elements within his constituency to support him in the first place . By the same arts , he got the attention and allayed the fears of his fellow elected officials . By careful attention to each opportunity for compromise as it arises , he makes sure that any enemy he must make on Point A is already partly a friend on Points B , C , D , et cetera . When he can not offer or feign agreement on any of these points , he must at least maintain a benevolent neutrality as long as possible . He becomes an accountant of little courtesies rendered and due , slight debts , accumulating favors . By such constant increments of advantage or leverage , power is attained and entrenched , and the politician is able to act , to fulfill his mandate . This is the moral foundation of political compromise . It makes the compromising of principle a politician 's only principle . Looked at in this way , compromise is just another name for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without compromise , a politician would not represent anything or anyone but himself . This matter is most often misstated by our moralists . We all grant that a man can suspend his private judgment when he is speaking for others ? in the politician 's case , for his constituency . But which part or parts of his constituency ? It is a complex little world he appeals to ? a delicate coalition he must forge between competing interests , even among his own supporters ( to say nothing of his opposition , which must also be placated ) . Some voters want A and some want Non-A , and some want A with this qualification while others want a different set of qualifications , and some do not care about A at all . The politician must get elected by suggesting that he would support all these people in one way or another . Then , once he gets elected and takes his seat with other representatives , a range of issues comes into view that was never considered in his dialogue with constituents . Some of them will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Which of these constituents ' views should he solicit and which ignore ? On what points should he take care to inform them , while rejoicing in their ignorance of others ? Or suppose a topic comes up about which his constituents as a whole have no direct interest or discernible opinion . It is , for them , a neutral issue . Is he allowed , here at least , to indulge his private views ? By no means . Insofar as he combines with men whose constituents do care about this topic , he will acquire the likelihood of their future cooperation on matters of vital concern to his own constituents . He thus represents their interest even on matters where they do not know they have an interest . It will readily be seen that consistency is a fault in politicians . Imagine a resolution that a Congressman opposes or must oppose , before his constituents , to be reelected . But the resolution has no chance of passage at this time . By encouraging his fellow representatives ' view that he really supports the resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for Point X , vital to him and his at that moment and whose passage is a close thing . No politician would hesitate a moment in so clear a matter . And later , when the earlier resolution gains ground , becomes a matter of concern to many , and is in danger of passage , it would be wrong for the politician to stay consistent with his earlier qualified approval of the resolution . Nor would colleagues blame him for this kind of reversal . There are many gradations of intensity in thecommitments , agreements , and disputes between such men . Weighing each one , its binding force , its probable effect , is at the very cen ? ter of the politician 's art . After all , by reversing himself on the one resolution , our imagined hero gives hostages for future ingratiation to the men who supported him on Point X. LL THIS IS CLEAR , in theory and practice . It presents no moral cause for the slightest hesitation on a politician 's part . But greater and less obvious demands follow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be politically important tomorrow . A subject not yet in debate may soon be up for negotiation one way or the other . It is best to have one 's options open when these topics emerge into debate by making no prior record on such matters at all . A reckless indulgence in private judgment , an indiscriminate " viewiness , " thus deprives a politician of bargaining opportunities . Besides , when a man has indulged private standards on one point , or two , where is he to draw the line ? Many would-be politicians have been tempted down this path of gradualism toward the politician 's hell of principle . And his fellows know this . They will not trust a man who squanders his views all at once , and has nothing more to spend in representative " deliberation . " Senators Morse and Gruening did not lose their seats , after opposing the Tonkin Gulf resolution , because their constituents loved the war . But it was clear that two men so at odds with all other Senators would have no success in future negotiations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go . Mark Twain understood this , and offered politicians the model that all their speeches should approximate : I am in favor of everything everybody is in favor of . What you should do is satisfy the whole nation , not half of it , for then you would only be half a President . There could not be a broader platform than mine . I am in favor of anything and everything ? of temperance and intemperance , morality and qualified immorality , gold standard and free silver . All politicians say as little as they can . Only the very greatest can get away with saying nothing . Abraham Lincoln in his 1860 campaign did not make a single speech , and refused to answer any questions about his views . He simply said that he would stand on his record , though his backers had sold him to the Chicago convention on the ground that ? compared to Seward , Chase , or Bates ? he had no embarrassing record of achievement one way or the oilier . Ironically , politicians must dress up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great political vice . They must conform to a convention that pictures them as addicted to severest rectitude , as bent on suicidal moralism . But all the formulae for this have been established , and need little study . Sometimes people go beyond the conventions , and pretend to a standard above their fellows . But these claims to political vice are fortunately , almost always empty . One Congresswoman , Shirley Chisholm. produced a book titled Unbought and Unbassed . That offends the convention . Other elected officials would modestly nod to that description of themselves , if it came from others ; but they would , just afterward , look nervously over their shoulders . As to being unbought : when Jack Newfield wrote an expose on lead poisoning in black slums where landlords let paint flake away , and then went to Washington seeking sponsors for a bill to remedy this , Mrs. Chisholm refused to join in the effort ? her 1968 campaign manager was a Bedford-Stuyvesant landlord . As for being unbossed : her black colleagues could not concert strategy around the strongest black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consulting other people 's interests , on launching her own feckless try at the White House . Another member of Congress who claims to he independent , Barbara Jordan , is beholden to the Texas state machine . At the Kansas City Midterm Conference of 1974 , she harl no time for meetings of the black caucus , but labored in promoting the candidacy of that machine 's man , Lloyd Bentsen . She also did service for Hans-Georg Rauch John Connally as a character witness before his predominantly black jury in the 1975 milk-fund trial . So even when politicians go out of their way to make special claims on the political vice of principle , we do not have to believe them unless overwhelming evidence proves them guilty . We can assume that if they had really indulged in principle , they would not be where they are , or could not be doing anything worthwhile in their office . We must not understate the constancy of the imperative for political compromise . One common way of defending the politician 's morality is to say that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own conscience on some Big Thing he cares deeply about . But no . Unless his Big Thing has a chance of instant passage , premature commitment to it can take away his chance for doing all the small good things within his reach . Indeed , if the one Big Thing has a chance to win , it will be as a compromise built on compromises , and the politician 's role is best played by refusing to give up all his bargaining power on the preliminary compromises necessary to the final one . It may even help him to have voted against the Big Thing beforehand . The politician is not a prophet crying out against power , but a technician learning to wield it . Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois spent most of his career working against civil-rightsbills of the kind he helped to pass , after suitable dilutions , in 1964 . He was not ultimately responsible for the bill ? prophets such as Martin Luther King were . But he was its principal se vicet when passage became politically desirable . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a claim into the heavens so that he , later , could tinker it into law . A minor achievement , but necessary . The useful politician is never a man in advance of his time . A taste for chicken salad I T IS NOT ACCIDENTAL , that most of our poli-ticians were educated as lawyers . Of the four-teen Presidents in this century , only four have not been Iawyers ? Harding , Hoover , Tru-man , and Eisenhower . Congress is dominated by lawyers , as are most statehouses . We have just the kind of regime the Russian emperor derided in the nineteenth century , a gouverne-ment des avocats . Many have criticized the pet-tiness of legal training , its effect on the politicians who share this kind of training . Jimmy Breslin grumbled at it yesterday , and Macaulay over a hundred years ago . It is easy to understand their objections . The lawyer 's skills are negotiatory , technical , mediating , neu-tral . He acts as an expert adviser or as an agent - for a client , not as a creative thinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to make the maximum claim on his client 's behalf ? whether to a jury , an insurance company , the IRS , a sued or suing opponent , or a partner in divorce proceedings . He speaks for one client today , another tomorrow ; one side now , a different one later . The neutral agent is not a friend of one side , and therefore no enemy to the other side . Legal adversaries can exchange their lawyers and the only difference ( if any ) will be in their technical skills . Having made the maximum claim for his own client , and expected a similar maximum claim from the other side , the lawyer must forge the terms of settlement and advise his client on them . If our own lawyer made less than the maximum legal claim for us ? out of ignorance , or reticence , or some private quirk and preference ? we would feel cheated . His services were not fully at our disposal ; part was kept to indulge himself . So the critics of the lawyer background shared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better training could be found for them . They , too , must struggle with each other yet be friends the next day ; make maximum claims as bargaining points but aim at a compromise settlement ; satisfy most people some what , rather than a few people fully ; represent diversity by muting difference ; be always more neutral than hostile ; deal in increments andmargins only , but deal constantly ; always adjusting , hedging , giving in a little , gaining a little ; creeping toward one 's goals , not heroically striding there . Always leaving oneself an out , a loophole , a proviso ? what Willmoore Kendall used to call " a verbal parachute " ? so that no alliance is irrevocable , no opposition adamant . Eugene McCarthy indulged his personal dislike of the Kennedys in 1968 , thus crippling the effort of his followers to unite with Kennedy people in a strong antiwar stand at the convention . He saw the people he liked to see ( Robert Lowell ) rather than those he had to see ( dull clumps of delegates ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lyndon Johnson , by contrast , was a superb politician all the time he was in the Senate . In 1953 he told a journalist friend that Vice-President Nixon was " just chicken shit . " The next week , Nixon returned from South America a mistreated national hero , and the first to hug him at the airport was Senator Johnson . The journalist asked him about his earlier opinion of Nixon . " Son , " Johnson replied , " in politics you 've got to learn that overnight chicken shit can turn to chicken salad . " The politician 's views insofar as they are distinguishable must be endlessly reversible . The art of always giving a foe some chance to save face , some opening for future cooperation , was understood by Mark Twain , who presented it with his customary exaggeration . In A Connecticut Yankee , Sir Boss has interfered in one of Morgan le Fay 's killing sprees : The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to hang the composer whose ditty had displeased her earlier without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? indeed , any one would have been , for she was really suffering ; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable , and had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities . I therefore considered the matter thoughtfully , and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and Bye again , which they did . Then I saw that she was right , and gave her permission to hang the whole band . This little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the queen . A statesman . gains little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all occasions that offer , for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates , and thus tends to undermine his strength . A little concession , now and then , where it can do no harm , is the wiser policy . It is amazing that an artist can put the essence of politics in so short a paragraph . The Yank has gained his first point , but raised the possibility of future trouble ( the queen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new question open ( " considered the matter thoughtfully , " hanging back , maneuvering . Then he suggested a compromise ( play the song again ) . Then he bestowed a generous concession to countervail earlier points he had won so that his very victory would not " undermine his strength . " He has achieved his own principal goal , neutralized his enemy 's ill will , prepared the ground for future gains ? and no harm done . The musicians were substandard . Egotism I T IS WIDELY BELIEVED that men become politicians to enrich themselves or to wield power . They are not above such considerations , because none of us is . But neither are they signally vulnerable to them . Most politicians have the gifts ? ambition , education , industry , obsequiousness ? to make money in any pursuit , and most could in fact make more money outside of politics . Lyndon Johnson became rich in politics , but he moved in those Texas circles where the very air is sticky with money ? when you come indoors , you must scrape it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly because he was a famous general the foundations of his wealth were laid before he went into politics . He would have been as rich , or richer , if he never ran for office . Nixon is more typical ? through most of his career , he lost money by being a politician ; andwhen he finally decided to steal , he was not very good at it . Admittedly , politicians service the forces of wealth , both to get help in their own campaigns and to govern this plutocratic society . But their return is often in the form of " ' contacts , " favors , flattering solicitude , and campaign support rather than personal wealth . Indeed , it often shocks men , when a financial scandal breaks , that our politicians can he bought for so little ? airplane rides for Tom Dodd and paper bags of money for Spiro Agnew . Perhaps these are merely down payments ? politicians often retire to money , cashing in on favors done while they were in office . But few retire before the voters force them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation . It was rarely the first motive for seeking office . Much of what looks like corruption grows up naturally from the way a politician goes about his business . There are lots of people trying to do him favors , often quite innocently . It is hard to separate these from less innocent benefactors without alienating the well-disposed . I was with Sen. Lowell Weicker and two of his aides , once , in the Hartford airport . When Weicker checked in for the Washington flight , the airline agent invited him to have a free drink in the lounge . Mr. Weicker , who endeavors to he preppy-clean , declined ; but the rest of us wanted a drink , and tried to buy one . The waiter had been ordered not to take money from us . He was caught either way ? between his orders and the Senator 's arguments , briefly raised . Nothing short of a major scene could have prevented the favor . Airlines should not do such things , but they often do ? and politicians begin , however reluctantly , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many little favors . Senators , that is , rage and bellow when commercial planes are not held for them , or when other passengers are not bumped from first class . When a commercial liner tried to charge Senator Goldwater for two first-class seats , on the frivolous ground that he was actually going to use two first-class scats -- -his arm was in a cast and had to be extended ? the stunned legislator called his friends at Northrop Corporation , who sent an empty plane all the way from Los Angeles to fly the Senator out of Washington , free of charge . This is not a pleasant side of the politician 's character ; but it is not the same thing as a dogged pursuit of wealth . Besides , think of the men already wealthy who go into politics . What are they after ? The normal answer is power . But that answer must he severely qualified to make any sense . Real unchecked power is wielded more by executives , corporate lawyers , or establishment advisers than by politicians of any but the highest level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long service lower down . Even the most unfettered politicians must defer to voters , bosses , backers in a way that would disgust the executive with his squad of flunkies . Nelson Rockefeller hardly acquired more power , when he became Governor of New York , than was his before and he had to kowtow to many party regulars and plain voters in order to get there . IL is not power , as such , that men of his sort seek , but recognition . They like to be known , photographed , flattered . They enjoy doing things like making speeches , a futile exercise if wielding power is what they want . They nurse the same itch that performers have to be at center stage , in the limelight , soaking up applause . Pride I HAVE ALREADY DISTINGUISHED this egotism from pride . Pride , stiff and prickly , rarely comforts its possessor . The proud man will not stoop to woo strangers , peddle his own praise up wide streets and down back alleys , risk heckling and insult at factory gates and subway outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy favor with his wounds , however honorable in fact , because the wounds are honorable in themselves , and he would not cheapen them . But egotism lives on handshakes , praise , and autographs given . It is fed with small things ? but it must be fed constantly . It screens hostile recognition through a private converter that makes the recognition matter more than the hostility . The politician 's ego is a very specialized instrument . It is insatiable , yet yielding to get what it wants it will do many tasks not only difficult but demeaning . Politicians must meet with people they do not want to see , praise and flatter those they despise , show interest in silly constituents and courtesy toward impolite ones . They must show up at dull affairs not only for their own campaigns but for those of other men in the party . They must submit to showy contributors who like to prove their access to the candidate or officeholder , suggesting that the contributor is not only a patron but an owner of his client . Even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to things most politicians undergo as a matter of routine . They must smile when insulted by a stranger . When , once , George McGovern refused to smile when he told a heckler at an airport fence , " Kiss my ass " ? this struck men as refreshingly different . But even he allowed himself this uncustomary freedom when his campaign was almost over and had obviously failed . People who do not have that particular kind of ego do not get into politics , or are soon forced out . A partial exception establishes the rule . Thomas d'Alesandro lIf came of a political family in Baltimdre , and was groomed from childhood to become mayor , as his father ( Tommy Junior ) had been . But Tommy the Third did not like the drudgery or insults he underwent , and he announced he would not run for reelection . So rare is it for a politician to withdraw from a sure scat , except to seek a higher one , that city hall reporters thought there might be a damaging scandal ready to break . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he called them in to explain himself ? and explained much about politics also : " I know what you guys are thinking ; but I 'll give you my real reason for withdrawing . Every day I get up , there 's a nice limousine waiting for me , the chauffeur opens the door and says , Good morning , Mr. Mayor . ' I get here , come in , everybody is greeting me , respectful . I come into this nice office with the big desk . The secretary comes in ' Good morning , Mr. Mayor ' ? and holds out a big silver tray full of shit . Would you please eat this , Mr. Mayor ? ' Well , it takes all day ; but I finally eat it and go home . And the next morning when I conic in she has a fresh platter of shit for me to eat . " The real trick of being a politician is to persuade yourself that it is ice cream . Tommy could not meet the test ? he kept remembering what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rescues the politician from hypocrisy . He can normally manage to believe what he is saying for the time it takes him to say it . This gives him a certain sincerity even when he is saying opposite things to opposite people . Since he loves to he pleased by the gratification of his ego , he tries to please people back . He genuinely dislikes disagreement with anyone . It interrupts the reciprocal laving of egos ; it puts grit in the butter bath . He wants to agree with everyone , and finds ways to accomplish this . In the McCarthy era , when some were organizing to have the Senate refuse to seat the man from Wisconsin . Sen. Matthew Neely of West Virginia said he would love to help in that effort , but he had just been assigned the office across from McCarthy 's , and he could not stand the unpleasantness of bumping into McCarthy 's aides all day if he knew they did n't really like him . This capacity to induce the appropriate belief at will shows up in almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to lose an election . No matter how bad his chances , he clings to the desperate hope that some miracle will save him in the end , and is usually the last man around him to know that he has lost . This self-induced blindness is an act of charity to the candidate 's followers . Every day he must watch them struggling for him , giving up time and money and effort ? often , indeed , losing health or mental balance and family in his cause . He can not realistically tell them that they are wasting their time , that it is all for naught . On the other hand , it would he hard to lie to them day after day and know that he was lying , at such cost to his devoted followers . It saves psychic wear and tear on all involved if the candidate can just manage to believe that he will win , no matter what the facts are . By the end of the campaign , much of the hoopla around the campaign plane or tour is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can dispense it to the tiring army of workers . Sometimes withdrawal from the campaign plane toward reality becomes too cruel . The candidate needs his daily " fix " of crowds , even though it is draining all his energy . A true master of politics , such as Franklin Roosevelt , will in time persuade himself not only that he can not be voted out of office but that he will never die . The politician is even more suggestible than the actor who disappears into a role , since the politician 's performance never ends . The curtain rises in the morning and falls at night even as his eyelids open and close . So it is unfair to call politicians liars . Most of them can not tell , any longer , what the truth is ? and therefore they can not lie . They have sacrificed their capacity to distinguish facts from what their egos want the facts to be . They deserve credit , and not scorn , for this act of self-immolation to the nation 's politics . Mediocrity T HE OLD SAYING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . That was a lie for most of the populace women , blacks , Indians , Jews , Catholics , the uneducated , the poor . It is also an insult ? most Americans are too bright , or quirky , or interesting to be politicians . On the other hand , not every politician was born mediocre . Some have learned to he . It is not easy . Hilaire &Hoc,; after spending a term in the House of Commons , wrote : " The standard of intellect in politics is so low that men of moderate capacity have to stoop in order to reach it . " He meant this as a criticism ; but it is good that some men are willing to stoop . How else would our politics get done ? Eugene McCarthy spent a good deal of his time trying to prove he was too good for politics . But of what use is that ? Most of us are too good for politics ; but we do not make a career of demonstrating it . The fair man must recognize the positive uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have admitted that a politician must be representative ? and that means he must be predictable . He must be chosen because his general circle of thought is known and agreedto . He is not likely to depart too markedly from that agreed-on area of thinking . H he were startlingly novel in his approach , liable to strike off on his own , capable of bold invention and unafraid of its consequences , only an idiot would ask him to represent the mass of common men . We have also said that a politician must compromise . This militates against rigidity of opinion . On the other hand , a politician is expected to speak often and on all kinds of subjects ; to show his wares , as it were , so people can decide whether he represents them , or can bargain with them , or will yield enough to them . He must have a wide , if shallow , stock of knowledge and oratory . He must convince people just enough without committing himself too much . A shallow mind is necessary for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the gifts to be profound . Listening to parliamentary debate , where men say one thing now and another thing later , where they are plausible for a moment without being bound for the morrow , Macaulay concluded : The talent for debate is developed in such men to a degree which , to the multitude , seems as marvellous as the performances of an Italian improvvisatore . But they are fortunate indeed if they retain unimpaired the faculties which are required for dose reasoning , or for enlarged speculation . Indeed , we should sooner expect a great original work on political science ? such a work , for example , as The Wealth of Nations ? from an apothecary in a country town. , or from a minister in the Hebrides , than from a statesman , who , ever since he was one-and-twenty , had been a distinguished debater in the House of Commons . Even in the comparative leisure and privilege of the eighteenth century , it was noticed that Burke was ineffective as a practical politician to the extent that he was bold and deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Charles James Fox said of Burke , he was right " too soon . " He could not do anything about being right ; so , politically , what good was his brilliance ? ( It served , of course , outside politics , for those able to read and be enlightened by him . A very original man must shape his own life , make a schedule that allows him to reflect , and study , and create . But politicians live with a crowded schedule largely out of their control ; they must turn their minds quickly from one thing to another , with the kind of instant improvisation that interrupts any longer course of reflection . It is fortunate that , where having fixed or individual opinions would be a disadvantage , the very nature of politics makes it hard to have such opinions . Bagehot 's formulation of the case is definitive : It requires a great deal of time to have opinions . Belief is a slow process . ... Our political system , indeed , seems expressly provided to make it unlikely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most bewildering is distraction : our system is a distracting routine . ? . It is wonderful that our public men have any minds left , rather than that a certain unfixity of opinion seems growing upon them . We may go further on this subject . A great administrator is not a man likely to desire to have fixed opinions . His natural bent and tendency is to immediate action . The existing pressing circumstances of the case fill up his mind . The letters to be answered , the documents to be filed , the memoranda to be made , engross his attention . He is angry if you distract him . A bold person who suggests a matter of principle , or a difficulty of thought , . . . in the case ' before the board , ' will be set down as a speculator , a theorist , a troubler of practical life . To expect to hear from such men profound views of future policy , digested plans of distant action , is to mistake their genius entirely . It is lac asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the funds this day six months ? His whole soul is absorbed in thinking what that price will be in ten minutes . A momentary change of an eighth is more important to him than a distant change of a hundred eighths . So the brain of a great administrator is naturally occupied with the details of the day , the passing dust , the granules of that day 's life ; and his unforeseeing temperament turns away uninterested from reaching speculations , from vague thought , and from extensive and far-off plans . We must remember that Bagehot is considering the peculiar genius of a master politician , such as Sir Robert Peel . The useful intellectual lim-its he describes would be even more apparent in a less talented , educated , dedicated man . It is the very best political mind he is describing , not that of political hacks . Bagehot , moreover , was writing at a time when politicians com-posed their own speeches , when the pace of life was less jagged , when the demands of quick travel and communication had not been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on quick yet careful adaptability , has multiplied many times since then . The modern politician is watched all the time , one way and another . He is onstage to a wider and less dis-criminating audience than Robert Peel had to suffer . No wonder he has no time to write his own speeches , or the books he lends his name to . Even when he retires from office , the effect of such scattered intellectual attentiveness re-mains . He can not collect his wide experiences into writing that makes reflective use of them . We no longer even expect it ? nor should we . We have said that the politician must in-SEPTEMBER 1975 dulge a constructive egotism . This drives him to seek flattering company , which means light company , even when he is not obliged to by political duties . The only distraction from showing off is to show off in company even more certain to be obsequious than a rally of one 's own party would be . The only distraction from politics is talking about politics to one 's cronies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the polished man on the stump ? witness the private Lyndon Johnson . But politicians are bound to collect a penumbra of toadying listeners , an uncritical audience that soon becomes necessary to them . There is nothing more conducive to mediocrity than such a crew . That is why there is very little to choose between Red Fay and Bebe Rebozo . Here is the former , engaged in his regular duties for the Prince ( as remembered in Ben Bradlee 's Conversations With Kennedy ) : There was a bunch of toasts , including Red Fay 's vaudeville act in which he sings , if that 's the word , " Hooray for Hollywood . " This act panics the Kennedys , and they 've heard it a hundred times . No one else quite understands why . Rebozo , it will be remembered , amused his President by putting a female mannequin in a guest 's bed on his houseboat . We must judge politicians ' minds by the natural level they seek , the company they keep , and the company that puts up with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seeking things from them , to blossom into previously unsuspected charm . Cambridge academicians who could not wait to get out of Henry Kissinger 's company when he taught there tried to wheedle their way into his presence when he went to Washington . But once that spurious glamour is removed , and one has heard the politician 's stock of stories once or twice ( they recur diurnally ) , few would seek out his company . Not many want to spend much time with politicians even when they are in power . That takes a positive thirst for mediocrity like Theodore White 's . I have defended politicians here by denying charges against them that are largely false ? that they arc extraordinarily venal , or power-mad , or liars . I have argued that some things thought to be charges against them ? their compromising nature , and egotism , and mediocrity ? are actually recommendations . This may modify their pretensions ; but it puts them on more solid ground . I speak with no irony when I say they have constructive faults . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorantly are we ruled . That misses the point . There is no other way we could be ruled representatively . Virtue and brilliance are uncommon , volatile , distrusted . We need men we can trust .
