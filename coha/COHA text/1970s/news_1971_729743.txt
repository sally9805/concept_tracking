txt In the Christian Council of Nigeria offices Lawrence Burley smiles . " I 'd like to do a master 's degree in public health , you see , " he says , " and I 've been wondering if what we 've learned here could be applied to similar situations . " Mr. Burley is a young Englishman , and now that relief efforts here are phasing out , he and other voluntary agency and government officers are pondering their lessons . Some , like-Mr . Burley , are willing to discuss their conclusions . Others are not . Those who decline underline that even now relief and ' its administration are touchy subjects here . They are still supercharged with that taint of politics which relief in Nigeria has never successfully escaped . Some officers try to view these lessons as applicable to other disaster situations . They point to the one caused by the flood of East Pakistani refugees into India . " There are n't all that many similarities , you know , " Mr. Burley says . He scratches his well-trimmed beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But there are enough to construct ' a model . ' // Sunset over Lagos harbor *Dos and don'ts from Nigeria aid efforts // " First , the government is sensitive-because it 's poor and ca n't solve the problem itself . ' Second , there 's a tendency toward corruption in administering relief . That 's because of poverty , competition for jobs , family ties , and so on . Usual criticisms ' " Furthermore , communications are poor . Relief agencies do n't know what the real needs are . They set up disaster relief with development programs growing out of it . People who do n't get relief are jealous . There are the usual criticisms . " He shrugs . " It always comes back to the disparity between the rich nations and the poor ones , does n't it ? " he says . But what are the lessons once relief work actually begins ? Ukpabi Asika , Administrator of the Ibo heartland , the East Central State , believes the first lesson is " to take the politics out of relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve ; many relief officers regard it as impossible . " It cheapens the process , " Mr. Asika claims , " leads to conflicts , and in the end no relief is given . " Secon y , c tinues , " I would hope relief donors Id acquire more charity . Giving relief does n't become a charitable act if it is done with paternalism or a Pharisee complex . " A third lesson , according to Mr. Asika , is to reduce overhead costs . These rise , he feels , when the voluntary agencies persuade themselves that they are the only fit administrators of relief . Mr. Asika believes that this attitude leads to an influx of expatriate personnel ? some " unteach ? able , " others " working out their private neuroses " ? who must be expensively housed and transported . As a result , he con ? tends , most of the money " goes into ad. ministering the administrators . " Alvin Edgell of CARE speaks of operational lessons . " Look as far ahead as possible , " he advises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change comes then . There 's a lot of chaos . Everyone is desperately working to reestablish his personal life . This reduces the energy and funds available for public purposes . Do n't get stuck with patterns , " he adds . " But of course you ca n't improvise everything every day . " For Patrick Graham , the Nigerian chairman of the East Central State Rehabilitation Commission , there is one primary lesson . " Everyone has his cultural pattern , " he says , " and relief donors should follow traditional behavior in order to reinforce it . Timing f actor " Breadlines dehumanize he adds . " It 's survival of the fittest there . " Mr. Graham feels that voluntary agencies should prepare for their work by studying local social structures . Another agency officer comments that these are standard criticisms . In his view , the crucial decision is " when to cut off the relief , " when to force people back onto their own resources . Can these lessons be collated , absorbed , and applied elsewhere ? Opinions differ . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he doubts that there is a willingness to learn . Relief officers acknowledge a tendency to hurry from one disaster operation to another . Moreover , they appear to lack mechanisms for compiling and diffusing information within the relief-administering community . One officer believes that an even greater problem exists . It stems from the agencies ' competition with one another for donations supporting their work . This competition leads , he says , less to study of past lessons than to public-relations consciousness , emotion-catching projects , and programs with popular appeal .
