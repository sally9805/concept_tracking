Many office Romeos are really Juliets <P> Forget about that scene in the movies when the pin-striped boss looks at the usually prim secretary and exclaims , " Why , Miss Smith-Mary-you have taken off your glasses ! " Nowadays , it is likely to be a Ms. who is doing the noticing . The woman boss , once a corseted cliche in man-tailored suits , has begun to win a reputation for eying the boys in the office . That is the conclusion of a study by two U.C.L.A. psychologists , Barbara Gutek and Charles Nakamura , called " Sexuality and the Workplace . " Men , they report , have joined women as victims of sexual harassment on the job . <P> Under Gutek and Nakamura 's direction , 63 students interviewed 178 men and 221 women living in Los Angeles , all relatively young , well-educated and financially independent . Nearly 45% of the men and 47% of the women reported that supervisors or co-workers of the opposite sex had made admiring sexual comments ; 31% of the men and 33% of the women spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made abundantly clear to 6% of the men and 11% of the women that they were expected to sleep with their bosses or with influential co-workers in order to keep their jobs .
