IT USED TO BE that you could tell 1 just about how poor a family was by how many dogs it had . If it had one , it was probably doing all right . It was only American to keep a dog to represent the family 's interests in the intrigues of the back alley : not to have a dog at all would be like not acknowledging one 's poor relations . Two dogs meant that a couple were dog-lovers , with growing children , but still might be members of the middle class . But if a citizen kept three , you could begin to suspect he did n't own much else . Four or five irrefutably marked the household as poor folk whose yard was also full of broken cars , vandalized for parts . The father worked not much , fancied himself a hunter ; the mother 's teeth were black . An old bachelor living in a shack might possibly have even more , but you knew that if one of them , chasing a moth , did n't upset his oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fetch up in the poorhouse soon , with the dogs shot . Nobody got 6 poor feeding his dogs , needless to say , because the more dogs a man had , the less he fed them . Foraging as a pack , they led an existence of their own but served as evidence that life was awfully lonesome for him and getting out of hand . If a dog really becomes a man 's best friend , his situation is desperate . That dogs , low-comedy confederates of small children and ragged bachelors , should have turned into an emblem of having made it to the middle class ? like the hibachi , like golf clubs , and a second car ? seems at the least incongruous . Puppies which in the country you would have to carry in a box to the church fair to give away are bringing $75 apiece in some of the pet stores , although in fact dogs are in such oversupply that 150.000 are running wild in New York City alone . There is another line of tradition regarding dogs , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doberman guard dogs , bulldogs as ugly as a queen 's dwarf . An aristocratic Spanish lady once informed me that when she visits her Andalusian estate each fall the mastiffs rush out and fawn about her but would tear to pieces any of the servants who have accompanied her from Madrid . In Mississippi it was illegal for a slaveholder to permit his slaves to have a dog , as it was to teach them how to read . A " negro dog " was a hound trained by a bounty hunter to ignore the possums , raccoons , hogs , and deer in the woods that other dogs were supposed to chase , and trail and tree a runaway . The planters themselves , too , for whom hunting was a principal recreation , whooped it up when a man unexpectedly became their quarry . They caught each other 's slaves and would often sit back and let the dogs do the punishing . Bennet H.

" Only recently in Louisiana I heard what happened to two Negroes who happened to be fishing in a bayou off the Blind River , where four white men with a shotgun felt like fishing alone . One was forced to pretend to be a scampering coon and shinny up a telephone pole and hang there till he fell , while the other impersonated a baying hound .

Dogs need leadership , however ; they seek it , and when it 's not forthcoming quickly fall into difficulties in a world where they can no longer provide their own .

A friend of mine hunts quail by Jeep in Texas with a millionaire who brings along forty bird dogs , which he employs in eight platoons that spell each other off . Another friend , though , will grow apprehensive at a dinner party if the host leaves a dog loose in the room . The toothy , mysterious creature lies dreaming on the carpet , its paws pulsing , its eyelids open , the nictitating membranes twitching ? how can he be certain it wo n't suddenly jump up and attack B his legs under the table ? Among jigsaw puzzle of moving to the suburbs : there to cook outdoors , another bit of absurdity to the old countryman , whose toilet was outdoors but who was pleased to be able to cook his meals inside the house . I HERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Thirty-seven thousand of them are being destroyed in humane institutions every day , a figure which indicates that many more are in trouble . Dogs are hierarchal beasts with several million years of submission to the structure of a wolf pack in their breeding . This explains why and " dogs " meaning villains or feet . Whereas a wolf 's stamina was measured in part by how long he could go without water , a dog 's is becoming a matter of how long he can hold his water . He retrieves a rubber ball instead of coursing deer , chases a broom instead of hunting marmots . His is the lowest form of citizenship ? that tug of life at the end of the leash is like the tug at the end of a fishing pole ? fun , and then one does n't have to kill it . On stubby , amputated-looking feet he leads his life , which , if we glance at it attentively , is a kind of cutout of our own , all the more so for being riskier and shorter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway , and we cart him to the dump and look for a new puppy . Just the notion that he lives on four legs instead of two has come to seem astonishing ? like a goat or cow wearing horns on its head . And keeping a dog is of course a way of attempting to bring nature back . The primitive hunter 's intimacy , telepathy , with the animals he sought , surprising them at their meals and in their beds , then stripping them of their warm coats to expose a frame so like his own , is all but lost . Sport hunters , especially the older ones , retain a little of it still ; and naturalists who have made up their minds not to kill wild animals nevertheless appear to empathize primarily with the predators at first , as a look at the tigers , wolves , bears , and mountain lions on the project list of an organization such as the World Wildlife Fund will show . This is as it should he , these creatures having suffered from our brotherly envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one does n't simply try to train him to be semihuman . The point of it is to open oneself to the possibility of becoming partly a dog ( since there are plenty of sub- or semihuman beings around we do n't wish to adopt ) . One wants to rediscover the communality of animal and man ? to see an animal eat and sleep that has n't forgotten how to enjoy doing such things ? and the directness of its loyalty . OLF BEHAVIOR prepared dogs for life with human beings remarkably . So complete and complicated was the potential that it was only a logical next step for them to quit their packs in favor of the heady , hopeless task of trying to keep pace with our own community development . The contortions of fawning and obeisance which render group adjustment possible among such otherwise forceful fighters ? sometimes humping the inferior members into the shape of hyenas ? are what squeezes them past our tantrums , too . Though battling within the pack is mostly accomplished with body checks that do no damage , a subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader that she will cringe and sit on her tail in response to his amorous advances , until his female coequal has had a chance to notice and dash over and redirect his attention . Altogether , he is kept so busy asserting his dominance that this top-ranked female may not be bred by him , finally , but by the male which occupies the second rung . Dominant wolves , being breadwinners , feed first and best , just as we do , so that to eat our scraps and leavings strikes a dog as normal procedure . Nevertheless , a wolf pup up to eight months old is favored at a kill , and when smaller can extract a meal from any pack member ? uncles , aunts , as well as parents ? by nosing the lips of the adult until it regurgitates a share of what it 's had . Indeed , the care of the litter is so much a communal endeavor that the benign sort of role we expect dogs to play within our own families toward children not biologically theirs conies naturally to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semaphore of mood and social code , but dogs carry their tails higher than wolves do , as a rule , which is appropriate , since the excess spirits that used to go into lengthy hunts have no other outlet than backyard negotiating now . In addition to an epistolary anal gland , whose message-carrying function has not yet been defined , the anus itself or stool when sniffed conveys how well the animal has been eating : in effect , its " income bracket , " although most dog foods are sorrily monotonous compared to the hundreds of tastes a wolf encounters , perhaps dozens within the body of a single moose . We can speculate on a dog 's powers of taste because its olfactory area is proportionately 14 times larger than a man 's , its sense of smell up to 100 times as keen . 0 The way in which a dog presents his anus and genitals for inspection indicates the hierarchal position that he aspires to , and other dogs , sniffing his genitals , are apprised of his sexual condition . From his urine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexual activity and general health even hours after he passed by . Male dogs dislike running out of urine , as though an element of potency were involved , and try to save a little ; they prefer not to use a scent post again until another dog has urinated there ? the first delight and duty of the ritual being to stake out a territory , so that when they are walked hurriedly in the city it is a disappointment to them . In the woods a dog will mark his drinking places , and watermark a rabbit 's trail after chasing it , as if to notify the next predator that happens by exactly who it was that put such a sudden whiff of fear into the rabbit 's scent . He squirts similarly the tracks of bobcats and skunks with an aloof air unlike his brisk and cheery manner of branding another dog 's or fox 's ; and if he is in a position to do so , will defecate excitedly on a bear run , leaving behind his best effort , which no doubt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal complaint people lodge against dogs is this extraordinary stress upon the bladder and scatology . Scatology did take up some of the slack for them when they left behind the entertainment of the forest : the forms of territoriality replacing the substance . But , apart from that , a special zest for life is characteristic of dogs and wolves ? in hunting , eating , then relieving themselves , in punctiliously maintaining a home territory , a pecking order , and a love life , and educating the resulting pups . They grin and grimace and scrawl graffiti with their piss . A lot of inherent strategy goes into these activities : the way wolves spell each other ? both when hunting and in their governess duties around the den ? and " consult " as a pack with noses together and tails wagging before flying in to make a kill . ( Tigers , leopards , house cats base their social relations instead upon what ethologists call " mutual avoidance . " ) The nose as their chief instrument of discovery corresponds to our eyes , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad breath " or putrefaction , and sniff intently for the details of illness and diet in their fellows , not closing off the avenue for any reason ? just as we rarely shut our eyes against new information , even the tragic kind . A LTHOUGH DOGS do n't see so sharp- ly , trainers usually rely on hand signals to instruct them , and most firsthand communication in a wolf pack seems to be visual , by the expressions of the face , by body English and the cant of the tail . A dominant wolf squares his mouth , stares at and " rides up " on an inferior , standing with his front legs on its back , or will pretend to stalk it , creeping along , taking its muzzle in his mouth , and performing nearly all the other discriminatory pranks and practices familiar to anybody who has a dog . In fact , what 's funny is to watch a homely mutt as tiny as a shoe box spin through the rigmarole which a whole series of observers in the wilderness has gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear ends to each other in an intimidating fashion , but when they examine the region of the head it 's a friendlier gesture , a snuffling between pals . One of them may come across a telltale bone fragment caught in the other 's fur , together with a bit of mud to give away the location of bigger bones . On the same impulse , wolves or free-running dogs will sniff a wanderer 's toes to find out where he has been roaming . They fondle and propitiate with their mouths also , and lovers groom each other 's fur with mouths adept as hands . A bitch wolfs period in heat includes a week of preliminary behavior and maybe two weeks of receptivity ? among animals , exceptionally long . Each actual copulative tie lasts twenty minutes or half an hour , which again may help to instill affection . Wolves sometimes begin choosing a mate as early as the age of one , almost a year before they are ready to breed . Dogs mature sexually a good deal earlier , and arrive in heat twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only during midwinter , like a wolf , whose pups ' arrival must he scheduled unfailingly for the spring . Dogs have not retained much responsibility for raising their young , and the summertime is just as perilous as winter for them , because , apart from the whims ) ' of their owners , who put so many of them to sleep , their nemesis is the automobile . Sex , like scatology , helps fill the gulf of what is gone . The scientist David Mech has pointed out how like the posture of a wolf with a nosehold on a moose ( as other wolves attack its hams ) are the antics of a puppy playing tug-of-war at the end of a towel . Anybody watching a dog 's exuberance as it samples bites of long grass beside a brook , and pounds into a meadow bristling with the odors of woodchucks. snowshoe rabbits , grouse , doe and buck , field mice up on the seedheads of the weeds , kangaroo mice jumping . chipmunks whistling , weasels and shrews on the hunt , a plunging fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to imagine the variety of excitements under the sky that his ancestors relinquished in order to move indoors with us . He 'll lie down with a lamb to please us , but as he sniffs its haunches , he must remember atavistically that that is where he 'd start to munch . BYRE IS POIGNANCE in the preidicament of a great many animals , needless to say : as in the simple observation which students of the California condor have made that this huge , most endangered bird prefers the carrion meat of its old standby , the deer , to all the cow , sheep , horse , and other carcasses lying about . Animals are stylized characters in a kind of old epic ? stylized because even the most acute of them have little leeway as they play out their parts . ( Rabbits , for example , I find terribly affecting , imprisoned in their hop . ) And as we drift away from any cognizance of them , we sacrifice some of the intricacy and grandeur of life . Having already lost so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primitive snatched forward from an earlier existence it might seem as if we had surrendered a richness comparable to all of the tapestries of childhood . Since this is a matter of the imagination as well as animal demographics , no Noah projects , no ethological discoveries on the few sanctuaries that have been established are going to reverse the swing . The very specialists in the forefront of finding out how animals behave , when one meets them , appear to be no more intrigued than any ordinary Indian was . But we continue to need ? as aborigines did , as children do ? a parade of morality tales which are more concise than those that politics , for instance , provides . So we 've had Aesop 's and medieval and modern fables about the grasshopper and the ant , the tiger and Little Black Sambo , the wolf and the three pigs , Brer Rabbit and Brer Bear , Coldilocks and her three bears , Pooh Bear , Babar and the rhinos , Walt Disney 's animals , and assorted humbler scary bats , fat hippos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for clean , universal definitions , and so it is that animals have gone with children 's literature as Latin has with religion . Through them they first encountered death . birth , their own maternal feelings , and the gaps between beauty and cleverness , or speed and good intentions . The animal kingdom boasted the powerful lion , the mothering goose , the watchful owl , the tardy tortoise , Chicken Little , real-life dogs that treasure bones , and mink that grow posh pelts from eating crawfish and mussels . In the cartoons of two or three 2 decades ago , Mouse does n't get along with Cat because Cat must catch Mouse or miss his supper . Dog , on the other hand , detests Cat for no such rational reason , only the capricious fact that dogs do n't dote on cats . Animal stories are bounded , yet enhanced , by each creature 's familiar lineaments , just as a parable about a prince and peasant , a duchess and a milkmaid , a blacksmith and a fisherman , would be . Typecasting adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedgehogs , and crows before : the shrewd image of Brer Rabbit to assist his suburban relative Bugs Bunny behind the scenes . But now , in order to present a contest between two thieving crows and a scarecrow , the storyteller must start by explaining that once upon a time crows used to eat a farmer 's corn if he did n't defend it with a mock man pinned together from old clothes . Crows are having a hard go of it and may soon receive game-bird protection . One way childhood is changing , therefore , is that the nonhuman fig-ures ? " Wild Things " or puppet monsters ? constructed by the best of the new artificers , such as Maurice Sendak or the Sesame Street writers , are distinctly humanoid , ballooned out of faces , torsos met on the subway . The televised character Big Bird does not resemble a bird the way Bugs Bunny remained a rabbit ( though already less so than Brer or Peter Rabbit ) . Big Bird 's personality , her confusion , have n't the faintest connection to an ostrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice has been slotted unmistakably toward the prosaic . Dr. Scuss did transitional composites of worldwide fauna , but these new shapes ? a beanbag like the Sesame Street Grouch or Cookie Monster or Herry Monster , and the floral creations in books ? have been conceived practically from scratch by the artist ? " in the night kitchen , " to use a Sendak phrase ? and not transferred from the existing caricatures of nature . In their conversational conflicts they offer him a fresh start , which may be a valuable commodity , whereas if he were dealing with an alligator , it would , while giving him an old-fashioned boost in the traditional manner , at the same time box him in . A chap called Alligator , with a fat snout and tail , can not squirm free of the solidity of actual alligators . Either it must stay a heavyweight or else play on the sternness of reality by swinging over to become a cream puff and a Ferdinand . Though animal programs on television are popular , what with the wave of nostalgia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about the animal kingdom , " The King is dead , long live the King . " Certainly the talent has moved elsewhere . Those bulbous Wild Things and slant-mouthed beanbag puppets derived from the denizens of Broadway ? an argumentative night news vendor , a lady on a traffic island ? have grasped their own destinies , as characters on the make are likely to . It was inevitable they would . There may be a shakedown to remove the elements that would be too bookish for children 's literature in other hands , and another shakedown because these first innovators have been more city-oriented than suburban . New authors will shift the character sources away from Broadway and the subway and the ghetto , but the basic switch has already been accomplished ? from the ancient juxtaposition of people , animals , and animals in dreams , to people and " monsters " that grow out of people by way of dreams . WHICH LEAVES US in the suburbs , with dogs as a last link . Cats are too independent to care , but dogs are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good opinion . We are coming to have no opinion : we do n't pay enough attention to form an opinion . Though they admire us , are thrilled by us , heroize us , we regard them as a hobby or a status symbol , like a tennis racquet. and substitute leash laws for leadership ? expect them not simply to learn English but to grow hands , because their beastly paws seem stranger to us every year . ( If they try to fondle us with their handyjack mouths , we read their caress as a bite . ) Like used cars , they are disposed of when the family relocates , changes its " bag , " or in time of divorce . The original reason people kept a dog was to acquire an ally on the hunt . Then it was to maintain an avenue to animality , as their own nearness began to recede . But as we lose our awareness of all animals , dogs are becoming a bridge to nowhere . We can only pity their fate .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
