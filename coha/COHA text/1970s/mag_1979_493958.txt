Steel Belted At a time when the economy is entering a recession , news of manufacturing workers being laid off normally falls into the dog-bites-man category . But when the United States Steel Corporation announced last week that it was closing down facilities at 15 different plants and dismissing 13,000 employees , it got everyone 's attention . US Steel is the nation 's biggest steelmaker , accounting for nearly a fourth of all the steel produced in this country . The layoffs , which reduced its payroll by eight percent , represented the most drastic reduction in the company 's history . The writeof f will cost the company between $600 million and one billion dollars , wiping out the $268 million profit it had recorded in the first nine months of the year . The company also warned that if conditions in the industry do n't improve , it may have to close more plants . Since the next six months are expected to be rough ones for the economy in general and the steel industry in particular , US Steel 's position is unenviable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact most of them thought the cutback was long overdue . US Steel has been one of the sick men of a generally unhealthy industry , and its problems have been getting worse , not better . Five years ago it made arecord $572 million on its steelmaking operations , but last year ? a reasonably prosperous one for the industry ? its steel profits were down to a meager $33 million . In the first nine months of 1979 , another fairly strong year , it made no money at all on steel . All of the company 's profits came from its other divisions , which include chemicals , railroads , and cement . Insrespects US Steel 's problems mirror those of the rest of the American steel industry . Thirty years ago the US produced half of the world 's steel , but by 1976 it accounted for only 17 percent of world production . In 1955 , this country was a net exporter of steel ; now 08 percent of the steel consumed here comes from abroad . While other countries , like Japan and those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US industry has increased total output only 30 percent since 1950 . The strenuous competition in world steel trade has taken its toll on the US industry . In the last 20 years it has been squeezed by chronically low profits . In only one year , 1974 , has the steel industry 's return on equity been as high as the national average for manufacturing industries . Last year its return on equity was less than half the American manufacturing average . In explaining his company 's troubles last week , US Steel chairman David Roderick rounded up all the usual suspects . He placed most of the blame on what he regards as excessive government regulation ( particularly by the Environmental Protection Agency ) and unfair trade practices by foreign steelmakers . Roderick also criticized the Treasury Department 's " trigger price " system , which is supposed to prevent foreign producers from " dumping " ? selling used at less than " fair value . " Unless Treasury cracks down on these allegedly dumped imports , Roderick wrned , his company would file anti-dumping lawsuits against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially noteworthy . The trigger prices were established in January 1977 , ostensibly to save the time and trouble of complicated anti-dumping suits , but also to protect US steelmakers from increasingly vigorous foreign competition . /mported steel that is sold for less than the established price automatically triggers a Treasury investigation , with the prospect of a stiff fine . ( Previously US firms had to file anti-dumping suits before the department would investigate . ) In effect , this system creates a minimum price for all steel products . This price supposedly is based on the Treasury 's estimates of production costs in Japan , the most efficient producer . Everyone agrees that the system has reduced imports , but exactly how much is hard to tell . Imports have fallen from the 1978 record high of 18.1 percent of the US market in 1978 ( when the trigger prices took effect only in May ) to 13 percent in the first half of this year , but that is partly the result of relatively high world demand . Imports normally fall during periods of strong demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy began to slow in the third quarter , imports rose to near 18 percent again . This normal tendency has been enhanced by the recent weakness of the yen against the dollar , which has the result of making Japanese steel cheaper . But the rising imports naturally upset Roderick , and the fate of the trigger prices now may rest on whether or not he carries out his threat . Treasury Undersecretary Anthony Solomon , the architect of the system , has warned that any spate of anti-dumping suits would cause him to scrap the trigger prices . That would be just as well . The evidence that foreign steelmakers are happily selling us their product for less than it costs them to make it always has been hard to find . Even in 1977 , when a poor market had provoked fierce price competition , studies by the Federal Trade Commission and Merrill Lynch concluded that the charge of selling at a loss was baseless . Certainly there is no logical reason for foreign steelmakers to make such a sacrifice . In bad times foreign companies do sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair competition . When the market is bad , a steel firm has two choices . It can shut down , in which case it is stuck with its fixed costs ? the cost of plants , equipment , and soon . Or it can keep producing , which offers some hope of bringing in enough money to cover not only the additional cost of producing the steel , but also some of its fixed costs . As long as a steel company can sell for a price that crs its marginal costs , it is better off f producing thanove shutting down , even though this will still result in a loss . The idea behind the dumping allegation is that it is necessary to prevent foreign steel companies from selling steel at such low prices that they lose more money by producing than by not producing . Such behavior would be inscrutable indeed , but there is no evidence to suggest that it exists . If foreign steelmakers were doing this sort of thing , they would be guilty of unfair competitive practices . But when Treasury talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under US law , " dumping " is defined as selling at below something called " fair value , " defined as the cost of production , plus transportation , insurance , duties , and a profit of eight percent . To sell at a profit margin of five percent constitutes unfair competition according to the Treasury Department . But no one in the steel industry enjoys profit margins of eight percent ; most are lucky to get four or five . By this standard , therefore , it is not only foreign steelmakers who are dumping , but also US companies , since none of them makes eight percent on sales . US Steel , of course , is losing its shirt , but nobody has suggested so far that this is unfair competitive behavior on its part . Alleged " dumping " is not the only excuse American steel companies offer for their poor showing against foreign rivals . Another accusation is that steel companies in Japan and Western Europe are heavily subsidized by their governments . " It 's difficult for any private company to compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in an interview with Iran Age magazine . This accusation also disintegrates under scrutiny . The only country that provides substantial help to its steel industry is Great Britain , which accounts for less than 10 percent of EEC production . Of course , it is not the British who are pressing the US steel industry , but the Japanese and Germans , who get no help to speak of . In 1977 the FTC calculated the value of all subsidies to the Japanese steel industry at only 46 cents per ton . ( A ton of steel costs about $400 . ) In West Germany , the subsidy is actually negative . The German steel industry gets subsidies worth about 44 cents per ton , but it is forced to use domestic coking coal in its operations , which raises its costs by nearly four dollars per ton . The Canadian steel industry , which is a growing competitor , also gets no significant help from its government . Nor do the environmental regulations imposed by the federal government , so bitterly castigated by Roderick , explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and water pollution standards has raised the cost of making steel . In 1967 the industry spent only about $100 million to meet environmental standards ; by 1976 it was spending five times that . But these rules added only about eight dollars a ton to the cost of making steel in 1976 . In any event , foreign steelmakers also have to meet increasingly stringent environmental rules . The Japanese industry , for example , spends about 20 percent of its capital outlays on pollution control ? at least as much as the US industry . The Germans spend a comparable amount . The real reason Japanese steelmakers have done so well in the US is that their production costs are lower . There are two crucial reasons for this . First is that they have more modern facilities . Much of American steel producing equipment dates back to before World War II , and some goes back to the turn of the century . The Japanese and EEC nations , by contrast , were forced by the destruction of the war to build their industries from scratch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel is produced in outdated open-hearth furnaces , while foreign steelmakers rely almost completely on newer , more efficient technology . The hi and reason is that US labor costs are considerably gher than those in other industrialized nations , and about double those in Japan . Labor costs make up 41 percent of the cost of making steel here . In West Germany the figure is 30 percent ; in Japan it is 25 . Steelworkers are paid about two-thirds more than the average US manufacturing worker . Higher US wages were no problem back when US workers were much more productive than those elsewhere , but worker productivity in Japan is now nearly as high as it is here . The competition is likely to get stiffer in the coming years , since some developing countries like Brazil and South Korea are beginning to expand steel production . In Korea workers are paid about a dollar an hour , compared with more than $16 in wages and benefits in the US . And third world countries can buy the same technology as more advanced nations . These problems afflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own making . Until last week , it had more obsolete capacity than any other American company . Two of its competitors , Bethlehem and the Lykes Corporation , took the step of closing plants and cutting the payroll two years ago , and steel experts say US Steel should have done so then instead of waiting two years . US Steel has been plagued by poor management , principally chairman Edgar Speer , who last spring was replaced by Roderick . " Speer was just sentimental about keeping things open , " o industry observer said . " Speer knew hardly anything ng about anything , except how to run a blast furnace , " a Wall Street analyst said . Experts attribute the latest actions to the company 's new president , James Rush , not to Roderick . The danger is that US Steel may not have gone far enough to solve its problems , and that in the long run they may be insoluble . The coming recession is bound to make life unpleasant for American steelmakers , and the temptation in an election year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protectionist measures to reduce imports of steel . But the temptation should be resisted . Helping American steel companies by choking off the supply of cheaper foreign steel will hurt consumers of products that use steel . It also will hurt other American industries . The immediate upshot of Treasury 's latest five percent increase in the trigger prices was to enable US Steel to raise its prices . That is good for US Steel . It is bad for automobile manufacturers , who will have to pay more for steel to build cars . When the US can manufacturers raise their prices to reflect the artificially high price of protected domestic steel , some of that cheaper foreign steel will come in anyway in the form of increased sales of foreign cars . Protecting the American steel industry will help a few Americans at the expense of the great majority , and it will aggravate the underlying problem by protecting the industry from the necessity of making those decisions that are essential if it is to remain competitive in the world market . The American steel industry is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the victim of honest and vigorous competition , which is likely to get even tougher . The sooner the industry recognizes that fact , and the sooner the government quits trying to keep the industry from adapting to it , the better off both the industry and American consumers will be .
