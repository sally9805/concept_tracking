 | HAPPILY , IT WAS RAINING . The good weather that had plagued me since my arrival in Alaska finally dodged behind a wall of clouds , and the drops began sifting down . " John Muir weather , " intoned my companion , Bob Howe , who superintends the unearthly preserve of water , ice , rock , and solitude called Glacier Bay National Monument . We were gazing out the rain-streaked window of ranger headquarters on a vista whose sheer sogginess would normally have had me rushing for the great indoors . But not this day , nor any other during my pursuit of John o ' Mountains ? a man who considered a storm an invitation and comfort an irrelevancy . Father of Yosemite National Park , savior of the sequoias , guiding light of the national park movement , explorer and mountaineer , naturalist and mystic , adviser to Presidents and gadfly of the establishment ? such was John Muir ( 1838-1914 ) , America 's apostle of wilderness . Pulling open the door of ranger headquarters , Bob Howe let in a gust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get wet to the bone , " he said , " but you 'll see she glaciers in the same light Muir did when he explored here in ' 79 . Better than bright sunlight , you know . Rainlight turns the ice to sapphire . " Later , soaking up some of that good John Muir weather on the foredeck of a small cruise boat , I confirmed Bob 's words . Before me , through misting rain and swirling clouds , a gigantic blue fist of ice ? half a mile wide at the knuckles ? punched  | directly out of treeless mountains into the bay . Not even Muir 's ecstatic descriptions could have prepared me for the overpowering reality of that ego-dwarfing , soul-expanding scene . Looking out on shining wet beaches slipping from beneath the receding Ice Age remnant , I felt as if I had arrived at the cutting edge of time itself . This was why John Muir had devoted his life to enticing others into the wilderness ? to share with each of us the incandescent experience of actually being there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I half fancied I would see Muir 's wild-bearded , baggytrousered figure disentangling itself from the mists out there , waving at me to follow . Certainly here was a man worth following . Indeed , if you happen to be looking for a guide to trackless regions ? outer or inner ? I can recommend none finer than John Muir . FULFILLING AN OLD DESIRE this past year , I undertook a pilgrimage to major way-stops along the great naturalist 's life trail , using his writings as my guidebook . With twofold purpose , I sought to absorb his wilderness gospel at the source and to see how , in the century or so since he traveled this way , things have changed ? or not changed ? in John Muir 's wild America . As if in antithesis to the epic grandeur ; of Glacier Bay , my trail head in this biographical journey lay in mountainless central Wisconsin . There , one green-and-gold Indian-summer day , I drove through a neatly barbered land whose trim farmhouses and cow-dotted meadows give an impression that this is the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers pulled back millenniums ago , this very same rural landscape had unrolled in their wake , complete with splitrail fences and flags-up mailboxes . Only an occasional patriarch oak , limbs gnarled arthritically , hints at the " glorious Wisconsin wilderness " that locked this land in green embrace when 11-year-old John Muir and his immigrant family arrived here from Dunbar , Scotland , in 1849 . It seems almost a calculated irony th . Muir should have begun his life in Americ as a destroyer of this very wilderness ? though in those days the destroyers were called pioneers . That primordial forest ha to be cut , its great oaken and hickory stum ; - extracted , its soil broken for farming ?  | labors requiring Herculean effort from a wiry lad whose head barely reached above the breaking plow 's handles . " We were all made slaves through the vice over-industry , " he later recalled . " After ght years of this dreary work of clearing the Fountain Lake farm ... father bought a halfsection of wild land four or five miles to the eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could emerge from this wilderness sweatshop and still look on a tree with love and consuming wonder seems one of his more remarkable achievements . In fact , it was in this Wisconsin crucible that Muir had the dawning notion of an idea that would , decades later , be magnified by himself and others into America 's system of national parks . Shortly before leaving his boyhood home , ' he said to his brother-in-law , by then the owner of Fountain Lake farm : " Sell me the forty acres of lake meadow , and keep it fenced , and never allow cattle or hogs to break into it ... I want to keep it untrampled for the sake of its ferns and flowers ; and even if I should never see it again , the beauty of its lilies and orchids is so pressed into my mind I shall always enjoy looking back at them in imagination .... " Unfortunately Muir lacked the cash to make a down payment on that dream . " Was n't till recent years that Fountain Lake farm got turned into a county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made Iuir 's Wisconsin years his life 's avocation . " The meadow Muir wanted to save was , crazed by cattle a good many years . But it 's finally been bought and included in the county park . Now it can grow shaggy-wild again . Muir 'd like that , I think . " Lots of folks hereabouts still hardly know who John Muir was , " Syl confesses . " Out in California , now , almost every schoolboy knows about him . But here , where he grew up , and where you might say the national parks had their start , well . . . I 've been trying for thirty years to have some kind of national park or monument established here . Maybe one day it 'll happen . " Syl , himself the inventor of an old-time jukebox called the Adrianola , reminds visitors that Muir first won local fame not as a naturalist or conservationist but as the inventor of an array of mechanical contrivances . Strange , marvelously sculptural creations they were : hand-whittled wooden clocks , including one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hung from a tree so fieldworkers might know the time ; an " early-rising machine " that tipped the sleeper out of bed at the appointed hour ; a mechanical scholar 's desk that shoved a textbook under the student 's gaze , allowed a given period for perusal , then replaced it with another ( pages 440-41 ) . With a sampling of these marvels , Muir departed the Wisconsin homestead at age 22 . Already luxuriating from his chin was the thick beard that would remain affixed there throughout his life . Maude Wells , 96 , of nearby Portage , recollects hearing her father , a boyhood friend of Muir 's , talking about the beard . " That beard really bothered father . It was so bushy and thick that things got tangled in it when Johnnie ate . Father was always after him to comb it out . " HE RAW YOUTH 'S astonishing invenTtions brought him instant acclaim at the Wisconsin State Agricultural Fair in Madison in 1860 , prompting prophecies of a great career as an inventor . Muir , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and devoured a self-selected curriculum in the sciences . Between terms he took wide-ranging geological and botanical " rambles " through wild parts of Wisconsin and adjacent states ? testing textbook theories against the realities they were supposed to explain . Finally , full up with formal learning , torn between a vague but ever stronger yearning to " go wild " and a need to earn a living , he listened to his more practical instincts and took a job with a carriage maker in Indianapolis . Almost overnight his mechanical innovations boosted the firm 's efficiency severalfold . The owner offered him a partnership , and a profitable , if mundane , future seemed assured , when fate ? as they say ? intervened . While he was working in the carriage shop , a file slipped from Muir 's grasp and lanced his right eye . The pain was exceeded only by his dismay when the left eye went sympathetically blind as well . Possibly deprived forever of seeing and exploring the world of wilderness , he came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would give up the inventions of men and devote himself to " the study of the inventions of God . "  | When the light gradually returned to both eyes , he launched unswervingly into his new vocation . " I might have become a millionaire , " he wrote , " but I chose to become a tramp . " No ordinary tramp , it might be added , for he had in mind nothing less than to trace the German explorer Von Humboldt 's trail across Venezuela 's Orinoco Basin , continue to the Amazon , and then raft down to the Atlantic ? a " ramble " of some 3,000 miles . First , however , he decided on a shakedown walk from the Ohio River to the Gulf of Mexico ? traveling , as would henceforth be his style , " by the wildest , leafiest , and least trodden way I could find .... " STRANGE FIGURE this bewhiskered citizen of the wilderness must have made as he tramped through Appalachia and the South , stopping when the mood struck him to examine an insect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of a flower in his plant press . In A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf , published posthumously from his journals , he describes his meeting with a backwoodsman , who challenged him : " You look like a strongminded man , and surely you are able to do something better than wander over the country and look at weeds and blossoms . " Muir asked him , " You are a believer in the Bible , are you not ? " " Oh , yes . " " And ... do you not remember that Christ told his disciples to consider the lilies how they grow ' .... Now , whose advice am I to take , yours or Christ 's ? " The backwoodsman stood convinced . In those post-Civil War years , roving brigands preyed on travelers as hawks on field mice . Once a thief stole Muir 's bag , then returned it after finding within " only a comb , a brush , towel , soap , a change of underclothing , a copy of Burns 's poems , Milton 's Paradise Lost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where his last few dollars ran out , Muir took refuge from bandits by sleeping in Bonaventure Cemetery . There , building a lean-to among the tombs and subsisting on crackers and muddy brown water , he waited out the days until a prearranged packet of money from his brother arrived at the local post office . Intersecting his route , I spent a few eerily beautiful after-midnight hours in Bonaventure 's crucifixed darkness . Feeling totally  | unmenaced , as Muir had , I could see why he described the graveyard as " so beautiful that almost any sensible person would choose to dwell here with the dead rather than with the lazy , disorderly living . " The bald eagles and lurking alligators he observed here have long since disappeared . But the towering live oaks bearded by windrippled Spanish moss ? " the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen " ? remain as nobly impressive as ever . Though many a tombstone has inevitably been added since 1867 , at least one other thing remains unchanged : the " hungry stinging mosquitoes " that Muir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vouch , remain as painful today as a century ago . Perhaps one of these lance-nosed beasties caused the " malarial fever " that struck Muir off his feet a few weeks later . Fortunately , newfound friends on Florida 's Gulf Coast took the stricken wanderer in . But the fever struck repeatedly , influencing him to abandon his itinerary through South America 's vapor-drenched jungles . He needed a healthier wilderness . N INNER COMPASS pointed westward to the soul-beckoning peaks of California 's Sierra Nevada . Muir recalled vividly a travel folder he had read , extolling the beauties of a newly discovered valley called Yosemite . There , he hoped , his fever might be " cooled with mountain winds and delicious crystal water . " Weeks later he arrived in San Francisco , and after a brief sojourn inquired of a passerby the quickest way out of town . " Where do you want to go ? " asked the man . " Anywhere that is wild ! " replied Muir . After days of tramping , he stood atop Pacheco Pass on a crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley at his goal , the Sierra Nevada ? " so gloriously colored , and so luminous , it seems to be not clothed with light , but wholly composed of it , like the wall of some celestial city . ... Then it seemed to me the Sierra should be called not the Nevada , or Snowy Range , but the Range of Light . " Today a ragged yellow veil of smog often curtains off that once transparent vista . California 's great Central Valley , described by Muir as " but little trampled or plowed as yet .. . one furred , rich sheet of golden compositae , "  | has today become a decidedly unwild place of farmyards , vineyards , feedlots , and upstart towns and cities . As I drove through the domesticated landscape toward Yosemite , the incongruity between Muir 's vision of 1868 and my own of 1972 jangled over and over again in the back of my mind like an out-of-tune piano chord . WITH A SENSE of deliverance I followed the snaking road upward out of the San Joaquin Valley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra . Here , at last , I found a reality to match what Muir had seen ? " a glorious wilderness that seemed to be calling with a thousand songful voices .... Beauty beyond thought everywhere , beneath , above , made and being made forever . " His approach to Yosemite Valley was an experience of successive revelations , as it is to the visitor today . On first seeing Bridalveil Fall from a distance , Muir remarked to a traveling companion : " See that dainty little fall . .. . It looks small from here , only about fifteen or twenty feet , but it may be sixty or seventy . " Most first-time visitors make similar mistakes , for the human eye simply loses its way in Yosemite 's mind-wrenching immensity . That waterfall Muir calculated on first sight to be 60 or 70 feet high actually spills a dizzying 620 feet . You can hardly enter the granite-walled enormity of Yosemite Valley without wondering how in the transcendental blazes such a geologic marvel could have been created . To y the untutored eye , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of naked granite had been made by some sort of cosmic karate chop . In fact , most theories of the time posited a cataclysmic origin for Yosemite . The eminent geologist Josiah Dwight Whitney concluded that the valley formed when a mile-wide wedge of the earth 's crust simply " sank down " during violent earth movements . Muir scoffed at such a notion . For one thing , he could not accept the idea that the bottom had dropped out of anything God had made . For another , his piercing blue eyes saw signs everywhere that a different agency had been at work here . He observed that " Nature chose for a tool , not the earthquake or lightning to rend and split asunder , not the stormy torrent or eroding National Geographic , April 1973  | rain , but the tender snow-flowers noiselessly falling through unnumbered centuries .... " The notion that snow , compacting into mighty glaciers , could have created the wondrous Yosemite Valley was as novel as it was poetic . In Muir 's time , theories on the role played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated . Whitney himself flatly asserted that no glaciers had ever existed in Yosemite . Even if they had , it seemed hardly likely that a mere thing of ice could ever have carved this mile-deep notch in the Sierra 's bedrock granite . Hearing Muir 's theory that converging rivers of ice had been the instrument of Yosemite 's creation , Whitney laughed it off as the wild mouthings of a man who had earned his living as a shepherd . Muir , indeed , had taken work as a shepherd during his first summer in the Sierra . He also was a horsebreaker , sawmill operator , carpenter , harvest hand , and guide in Yosemite Valley . Such jobs gave him the time and financial pittance needed to conduct his " mountain-work . " The brilliant mind so recently freed from its labors in the service of human technology now shifted its focus to the inner clockwork of Yosemite 's creation . On a placid bank of Yosemite Creek in the vast green-meadowed valley lies a small glacial boulder with a plaque recalling that Muir 's first cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramble began and ended here , " explains Yosemite historian Shirley Sargent . " It must have been the most charming place in the world to come home to . Just imagine . A full-face view of Yosemite Falls right out the door . Inside , a brooklet ran through one corner of the cabin , giving him a continuous supply of ice-cold water . Ferns and other plants grew wild inside . Even a few frogs made their home there , singing Muir to sleep with their chirping . " At every opportunity Muir gamboled up into the surrounding mountains to go sleuthing after vanished glaciers , tracing their onetime courses by deciphering the landscape 's " hieroglyphics " ? scratches on granite walls , oddly placed boulders , stone surfaces worn mirror smooth by the scouring ice . Nearly always he climbed alone , without ropes or pitons , using at most an ice ax , carrying only dried bread and tea leaves for sustenance . A thin blanket was his usual bedding , and even that was left behind on more strenuous climbs . Once , stranded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen mountaintop , he kept warm by dancing the Highland fling until dawn lighted his way back down . Many previously unclimbed Sierra crests ? including a 14,015-foot peak that later became Mount Muir ? succumbed to the tireless assaults of this transplanted lowlander . Between Red and Black Mountains he discovered a " living glacier ! " Here , at last , was a flat reproof to Whitney 's contention that glaciers had never existed in the area . Muir 's glacial theories , in fact , have proved more nearly correct than any others of his time . The modern view of Yosemite 's origin differs from Muir 's chiefly in giving more importance to preglacial river cutting and in determining that not one but several invasions of ice swept across the Sierra . But his basic premise that glaciers had helped gouge out Yosemite and similar valleys on the Sierra 's west slope has been solidly confirmed . To EVERY PHENOMENON of nature that passed before his glacial blue eyes , Muir turned the same loving inquiry . At times he proved as endearingly fallible as the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the belt of sequoia forests on the Sierra 's west flank had been plowed by glaciers . Scientists have since determined that the gaps have been created not by glaciers but by frigid air currents that drain down the funnel-like mountain passes . Indiscriminate slaughter of the Big Trees , largest of living things , was at its height in Muir 's time . Thousands were cut into shingles or blasted to smithereens to supply grape stakes for the San Joaquin Valley winegrowers . Of this wholesale destruction , Muir wrote : " As well sell the rain clouds , and the snow , and the rivers , to be cut up and carried away if that were possible . " His outraged cry , resounding in his lectures and a series of newspaper and magazine articles , had much to do with prodding Congress into finally setting aside Sequoia National Park in 1890 . Nothing quite so entranced Muir 's imagination as trees ? trees of any sort , particularly during a storm . Once , when a windstorm erupted while he was exploring the Yuba River Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir and " clung with muscles firm braced , like a bobolink on a reed , " remaining there for hours to hear the needles chorusing in the wind .  | He often demonstrated this capacity for transmuting physical danger into a kind of spiritual ecstasy . While climbing a canyon wall above Yosemite one day , he heard a terrible roar and abruptly found himself riding a snow avalanche 2,500 feet down to the canyon floor . Landing miraculously unhurt , he exulted in " This flight in what might be called a milky way of snow-stars . . . the most spiritual and exhilarating of all the modes of motion I have ever experienced . Elijah 's flight in a chariot of fire could hardly have been more gloriously exciting . " Another time , while climbing a sheer face of Mount Ritter , he found himself " brought to a dead stop , with arms outspread , clinging close to the face of the rock , unable to move hand or foot either up or down . My doom appeared fixed . I must fall ... . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve-shaken . . . and my mind seemed to fill with a stifling smoke . But this terrible eclipse lasted only a moment , when .... I seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense . The other self , bygone experiences , Instinct , or Guardian Angel , ? call it What you will , ? came forward and assumed control . Then my trembling muscles became firm again , every rift and flaw in the rock was seen as through a microscope , and my limbs moved with a positiveness and precision with which I seemed to have nothing at all to do . Had I been borne aloft upon wings , my deliverance could not have been more complete . " Once again , after he had ranged the Sierra and neighboring mountains for more than a decade , an inner compass needle pointed Muir in a new direction ? this time to Alaska . In that terra incognita , bought from Russia only a dozen years before , he could test his theories in a laboratory of living glaciers . Traveling by steamer to the raw little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | lanned to hire some Indian guides and launch . in expedition into glacier country . To the local Indians ? as to most whites of : he era , for that matter ? this intense , blueeyed Scot was a phenomenon almost beyond comprehension . His fascination with glacier country ? where they could see no sensible reason for a man to go ? earned him the sobriquet " Ice Chief . " Still Muir won their friendship , if not their understanding , with his transparent sincerity and warm interest in their culture . He especially admired the artistry of their totem poles . " With the same tools , " he observed , " not one in a thousand of our skilled mechanics could do as good work . " I SOUGHT OUT one of the last Tlingit totem carvers , octogenarian Tom Ukas , in a cramped rear workroom of a bleached wooden house in Wrangell . While the chips flew from his chisel , he spoke to me in low , murmuring tones . " Mostly I copy from old totem designs . The poles will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . They contain sacred old knowledge that someone must preserve . " Our young men , " he said with a sigh , " do n't want to be carvers . They want jobs at the cannery or sawmill . I can understand . But for years I worried that the knowledge in my fingers would die with me . Then .... " He nodded toward a black-haired youth bent over a small totem at a workbench . " That 's Harold . Harold Riach . No , he 's not Indian . He 's a South Korean , adopted by a local family and raised here in Wrangell . But he has the patience and the ability . And the desire . I 'm privileged to teach him . Soon the old knowledge will be in his fingers , too . Then I can stop worrying .... " The Indians Muir hired as guides in 1879 told him of a strange bay of ice , where rivers of blue snow ran into the sea . No vision could  | have been more compelling to the Ice Chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of Glacier Bay . My own cruise boat followed in their wake , entering a phantasmagorical realm whose waters are strewn with icebergs of the most fantastic shapes and astonishing blueness ? " shrieking vitriol blue , " Muir described it ( pages 444-5 ) . Clouds lay draped like cotton candy across glacier-scoured mountains that slumped round-shouldered into the sea . Ahead , through marbled mists , rose a stark blue cliff of ice . Reversing engines , our boat came to a stop half a mile away ? though it seemed hardly fifty yards . As if watching a silent movie , I saw a great slab of ice break off from the blue wall and slide into the water below , sending out a huge ripple . Moments later the berg thunder reached our boat , and I felt momentarily as if I were on the inside of a drum being pummeled by an angry strong man . The boat lurched and bobbed as tilting mini-bergs scraped ominously against our hull . A quick glance up at the captain ? his cigarette glowing calmly behind the pilothouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those bergs calving off the main glacier are typical of places where the ice meets tidal waters , " explained Park Service RangerNaturalist Barbara Minard , standing beside me on the pitching deck . " Some of these glaciers ? including Muir Glacier over to your left ? are retreating a quarter of a mile or more a year . " When Vancouver sailed by here in 1794 , he saw only a huge wall of ice at the mouth of a small inlet . By the time Muir arrived in 1879 , that inlet had become a bay stretching back more than forty miles . " In the ninety-odd years since Muir made the first detailed explorations , the glacier named for him has retreated another twentyfive miles . Those little beaches you see slipping out from beneath the ice have been untouched by sunlight for thousands of years . " I asked Barbara why the ice is so blue . " Compression from the fantastic weight of the glacier , " she replied with her usual knowledgeability . " The more compacted the ice , the more its crystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense blues everyone oohs and ahs about . " A TINGLING VIBRANCY animates Barbara 's voice as she expounds . Muir , too , had this way of speaking in raptured tones about things scientific . " Somehow a glacier never seemed cold when Muir was talking about it , " remarked a contemporary . After he returned from his rambles over the glaciers , Muir would collar the first available listener and breathlessly relate all that he had seen and learned in the " thousand rooms of God 's crystal temple . " It was this eagerness to communicate , this  | compulsion to transmit to the rest of us the vision of what he had seen , that was finally to bring John Muir down from the mountains to preach his wilderness gospel . More perhaps than any other individual of his time or our own , he was to give shape , impetus , and i poet 's voice to the national park movement . " Wildness , " he taught , " is a necessity ... mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was no easy message to get across in an era when most people looked on wilderness as something to be driven back , hewed down , conquered , and ? above all ? feared . Whether talking to Presidents or ordinary citizens , to railway magnates or farm boys , Muir would offer the same invitation : " Climb the mountains and get their good sidings . Nature 's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees . The winds will blow their own freshness into you , and the storms their energy , while cares will drop off like autumn leaves . " Following the wanderer 's life trail back to California , I stopped off at a somehow unMuirlike setting in the dusty coastal lowlands north of Oakland ? the John Muir National Historic Site at Martinez . Here , wedged between a freeway , a railway trestle , and the remnants of an orchard , stands the Victorian homestead ( left ) where John o ' Mountains came down to earth to conduct his messianic mission . Marrying the daughter of a California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing the family orchards at Martinez . So shrewd was he in business affairs that within a decade he had saved enough money to support his wife and two daughters and devote himself full time to saving America 's fast-dwindling wilderness . I spent a quiet hour among the shadows and memorabilia of Muir 's " scribble den , " where he labored countless deskbound hours reshaping his visions for the cramped confines of the printed page . Though the thunder of avalanches and calving glaciers had always delighted him , domestic noise he could not abide . In particular the sound of his daughters ' piano practice grated on his nerves . More than once his spare figure , pencil in hand , would loom at the top of the stairs and shout down for blessed silence . " For all his wanderings , Muir was an astonishingly prolific writer , " his bibliographer , William Kimes , told me . " I 've spent years tracking down all his published writings . So far I 've catalogued 425 separate published items newspaper features , magazine articles , contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " He also left more than sixty travel journals plus several thousand letters that often run half a dozen pages or more . I sometimes think the tip of Muir 's pen must have traveled nearly as far as the soles of his feet ! " But Muir had no liking for this " penwork . " A writer 's life , he once complained , is " like the life of a glacier , one eternal grind . " Even into old age , he would get away from his desk for periodic " rebaptisms " in the wilds . On one of these forays , in 1903 , he camped out alone with President Theodore Roosevelt in the Mariposa Grove of sequoias . " I stuffed him pretty well regarding the timber thieves , and the destructive work of the lumbermen , and other spoilers of the forest , " Muir later recalled . They camped out a second night near Glacier Point and woke up under four inches of snow . T.R. proclaimed it " the grandest day of my life ! " and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into motion governmental machinery to set aside five national parks , 16 national monuments , and 148 million acres of national forest . THE NAMES OF PARKS in whose origins Muir himself played a direct motivating role read like a conservationist 's doxology : Yosemite , Sequoia , King 's Canyon , Rainier , Petrified Forest , and Grand Canyon . He was also a guiding light behind the 1906 Antiquities Act , which gives Presidents the power to proclaim national monuments . The creation of the National Park Service , finally achieved in 1916 , two years after Muir 's death , was another of his worked-for dreams . Yet another accomplishment was the founding of the Sierra Club in 1892 . For eight decades that militant conservationist organization , imbued with Muir 's ideals , has stood watchdog against wilderness exploiters . Among so many successes there were , inevitably , defeats . Most painful of these to Muir was his failure to save Hetch Hetchy Valley , Yosemite 's magnificent twin to the north , from becoming a reservoir for San Francisco . " Dam Hetch Hetchy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's cathedrals and churches , for no holier temple has  | ever been consecrated by the heart of man . " Today , all-but-forgotten Hetch Hetchy lies inundated , its impounded waters closed to the public , its waterfall-tasseled cliffs visited by only a few climbers on weekends when , just 17 miles south , 40,000 or more visitors flock into superpopulated Yosemite Valley . But beyond his material successes or failures , Muir left a subtler heritage ? the luminous human example of his own life . Ralph Waldo Emerson , after meeting Muir in Yosemite in 1871 , returned to Concord and added Muir 's name to his brief list of great personages . At the time , Emerson was nearing 70 ; Muir was only 33 . N HIS OLD AGE Muir hopped restless ' ly from continent to continent , spreading his wilderness gospel far beyond home shores , and visitors came from afar to see him . A conversation with a Japanese nature enthusiast , Ryozo Azuma , inspired the latter to help develop Japan 's national park system , today one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muir 's message still rings with crystalline resonance . His notion of the interrelatedness of all nature , of man 's place in the midst of rather than on top of the scheme of things , has become a guiding principle for a new generation of kindred spirits . " When we try to pick out anything by itself , " he wrote , " we find it hitched to everything else in the universe . " The same idea underpins the modern science of ecology . Seeking out a closer communion with Muir , many a hiker carries his writings into the Sierra , there to recite them aloud around a campfire or absorb them silently while sitting alone , as Muir so often did , upon a makeshift pew of storm-felled sequoia . Climaxing my own Muir travels , I betook my city-soft muscles up the slopes of one final challenge ? the stone-and-ice immensity of 14,162-foot Mount Shasta in northern California . In 1875 Muir and a hiking companion nearly died atop Shasta during a raging snowstorm , saving themselves from freezing by wallowing in the hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accompanying me on the climb were a dozen supple-limbed and tireless teen-agers from a summer camp named Earth Camp One , run on Muirian principles by Steve Kubby of Montgomery Creek . Aware that city pavements were my natural habitat , Steve cautioned : " Remember . You do n't conquer a mountain like Shasta . You are permitted to walk on it . " Or not permitted , as I was to discover . A good many hours and thousands of feet later , at the foot of a torturous slope aptly named Misery Hill , I stuck my cramponed boot into a pothole of ice and gave a sharp wrench to my already rubbery left knee . It took only a few painful steps more to realize that Shasta 's summit would not stand beneath my feet that day . Sheldon Tarre , one of Earth Camp One 's leaders , was kind enough to help me hobble the long way down while the rest of the expedition continued to the summit .
