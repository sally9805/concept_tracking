After busing-bankruptcy and strikes <P> There was picketing over school integration in Chicago 's blue-collar Marquette Park area . In Louisville , a group of ingenious parents attempted , without success , to have their children reclassified as American Indians , because in Kentucky all nonblack minorities are exempt from forced busing . And in several cities , including Cleveland , racial calm existed because busing has still to be tried . <P> Even so , for the first time in years , rage and threatened riot over busing did not noticeably disrupt the opening of school . Instead there were a rash of teachers ' strikes , prospects of bankruptcy and fretting over budgets . At week 's end , with teachers in New Orleans , Cleveland and Seattle among those out , something like 675,000 students were without regular teachers or any instruction at all . <P> School districts everywhere were haunted by California 's Proposition 13 . Exactly a week before school was scheduled to start , for example , the Houston system learned that it would have to shave $6 million off the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 1977 value . Irate taxpayers all over the country were set to slash property taxes , traditionally the source of educational funds , and they were grimly disposed to get more educational mileage for less money . In New Jersey , a new regulation this year requires that even tenured teachers be evaluated on the basis of demonstrated " pupil progress . " <P> With all the difficulties there were signs of progress , notably in New York and Boston . A city-by-city sampling : <P> CLEVELAND . The school system is not only broke but existing on a $20.8 million startup loan from the state . Getting through the year will require a fiscal miracle . Taxpayers voted down an increase in the school levy last April and June ; they oppose the major busing plan that the courts have ordered for the city . ( The plan was postponed until next February since there was no money to buy extra buses . ) To make matters worse , nearly all of Cleveland 's 5,000 teachers , who often worked without pay during last winter 's near bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a 20% pay increase , which would add $24 million to the deficit . Even worse , the city stands to lose $29 million in federal aid if it does not institute a mandatory bilingual program , which is also beyond its means . <P> NEW ORLEANS . The hour before students turned up for the first day of school , New Orleans ' 5,300 teachers voted to go on strike . After a week , only 27% of them are reporting to work . Attendance has dropped to a third of the city 's 90,000 students . With salaries among the lowest in the nation ( teachers with B.A.s start at $10,100 ; maximum pay after 11 years is only $13,900 ) , teachers are demanding $5 million in salary increases and benefits . The school board says it will hold firm against the increase , and is paying substitutes double wages and keeping the schools open .
