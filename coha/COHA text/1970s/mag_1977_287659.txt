Two more political bombshells dropped on Israel last week , leaving citizens of the Jewish state as perplexed as they have ever been about the future of their tiny , troubled nation . <P> Bombshell No. 1-which happily turned out to be a dud-was the announcement that Menachem Begin , hawkish leader of the victorious right-wing Likud coalition in the election a fortnight ago , had been rushed to a Tel Aviv hospital complaining of chest pains . That raised doubts about whether Begin , 63 , who had suffered a serious heart attack only two months ago , was well enough to head a new government . The Likud leader , however , quickly recovered from what turned out to be exhaustion and a mild bout of angina pectoris , and astonished his countrymen by dropping bombshell No. 2 : he said that former Defense Minister Moshe Dayan , a longtime Labor Party maverick , had " agreed in principle " to become Foreign Minister in a Likud government . <P> The announcement was political dynamite . In the first place , it shook up the already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but needs the support of at least 18 members of other parties to have a fragile but workable majority in the 120-member Knesset . Begin apparently chose Dayan without consulting any of his colleagues , and many were furious . In addition , one of Likud 's potential coalition partners , the new Democratic Movement for Change , temporarily broke off talks with Likud . With the possibility of a revolt on his hands , Begin called a weekend meeting of the Likud executive committee to reconsider the Dayan appointment . <P> Much of the controversy springs from Dayan 's flamboyant personality and reputation . Although widely criticized for Israel 's unpreparedness at the start of the October War , the former Defense Minister , now 62 , is still favorably remembered , particularly by older Israelis , as the daring , one-eyed hero of the wars of 1956 and 1967 . Outside Israel , Dayan is probably better known than any other Israeli except former Premier Golda Meir , 79 . " Whenever he walks into the State Department in Washington , " says one Dayan supporter , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become Foreign Minister , his presence in the Cabinet will reinforce Begin 's tough position on the occupied West Bank . Since the elections , Begin has repeated that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are " liberated territories " - and talked of creating new settlements in the areas of ancient Samaria and Judea . Dayan feels pretty much the same way . Only last year , he told TIME Correspondent Marlin Levin : " We should implement Jewish settlement everywhere in the Jordan Valley without restriction , but without driving away the Arabs or imposing ourselves on them . " Dayan , however , is a good deal more subtle in his approach to the problem than Begin . For instance , he is said to have persuaded Begin not to move toward annexation of the West Bank as long as peace negotiations are in prospect . After that , Dayan wants the matter put to the Israeli electorate in a referendum-a shrewd move , since he is probably right in believing that a majority of his countrymen oppose the surrender of significant portions of the occupied territories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
