Pop art reflects the times . It is an expression of a society that puts less emphasis on breeding , formal education and even wealth than on presentation . . . It is a chic open to everyone , and qualifications for entry can be acquired as easily as learning the latest dance fad . <P> <P> Thus , in 1965 , the director of the Philadelphia Institute for Contemporary Art , Samuel Green , took the pratfall from the ivory tower in a preface to the world 's first book on pop art , an emetically extravagant volume by a writer named John Rublowsky . Yet who today shall say he was not right ? By 1965 pop had become the most popular movement in American art history , drenched in ballyhoo , gratefully supported by legions of collectors whose appetites bore the same relation to connoisseurship that TV dinners do to poulet en demi-deuil . Warhol , Lichtenstein , Indiana , Rosenquist , Wesselmann , Oldenburg , Johns and Rauschenberg became instant household names , not counting their swarm of epigones . " What we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence Alloway , " is a situation in which success has been combined with misunderstanding . " He had coined the term pop art , in England in 1957 , " to refer approvingly to the product of the mass media . " Appropriately , Alloway , whose fascination with mass culture as anthropology long predates the movement that he christened , has now organized a pop retrospective at Manhattan 's Whitney Museum . <P> In a weird way , this show exhales as musty and involuntary a breath of vanished time as any revival of neoclassicism . Andy Warhol 's Campbell 's Soup can , once considered an icon of intimidating cool , has become a sort of madeleine . Irrevocably , the cachet of pop has gone , and many of its artifacts now look tenuous . It can not be long before some enterprising museum ( the Metropolitan ? ) opens a ' 60s Period Room , to go with its transplanted Louis Quinze paneling and reassembled colonial parlor : a Wesselmann and a Warhol Marilyn on the stainless-steel walls , a coffee table strewn with multiples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under the supergraphic in the corner a waxwork group of Henry Geldzahler hustling that week 's trend to a slim , wrinkled matron in bandoleers and Courrges boots . <P> Pending such feats of instant nostalgia , all we are left with is the pictures . The crass cultural chauvinism and blatant flackery that surrounded and fed American pop have not by any means gone from the art scene , but they are muted . All the talk about how pop meant a democratization of the art experience , how it would obliterate the line between " art " and " life , " has turned out to be the merest jive . It could hardly be expected to convince anyone in a world where Lichtensteins cost $50,000 apiece . <P> Systems and Signs . There is no longer any difficulty in seeing the best of pop as a mannered game with art language , rather than a vulgarian 's assault on le beau et le bien . Ten years ago , Art Historian Robert Rosenblum predicted that " the initially unsettling imagery of pop art will quickly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ephemeral or enduring pictorial values will become explicit .
