txt A preliminary check by congressional investigators has turned up six different areas on President Nixon 's income tax returns where he could owe the government additional back taxes . informed sources said today . The six areas are in addition to the two specific deductions involving the sale of Nixon 's San Clemente property and the gift of his Vice Presidential papers which he asked the Joint Committee of Internal Revenue Taxation to examine . THE SOURCES declined to estimate the amount of money involved or to identify the specific entries in question . However , it is known that committee staffers have been assigned to investigate : ? The President 's deduction of $32,167.86 as 25 per cent of the operating cost of San Clemente as a personal expense . ? The dependency deduction for his daughter Tricia in 1969 and 1970 . ? The $150,000 sale of Florida property in 1972 which had been purchased with funds originally set aside in a trust fund for Tricia . The committee 's investigation , the sources pointed out , is still in its infancy and no final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . They also said they doubted the authenticity of a published report yesterday that the IRS , which is reexamining the President 's returns , is already prepared to assess the President another $30,000 in connection with the sale of part of his San Clemente property in 1970 . THE SOURCES said Abe $30,000 is the amount due if it is determined that the President should have paid capital gains taxes on the sale , but that the congressional committee had no indication such a decision had been made . Meanwhile , it was learned that two committee investigators were in California today preparing to examine the San Clemente land involved and all sales and tax records . The investigators are trying to determine whether Nixon should have admitted a capital gain of about $233,000 on the sale of land adjacent to his home to his friends , Robert Abplanalp and C. G. ( Rebel Rebozo . Altho at least one auditing firm reports to the President that such a gain was involved , his tax accountant , Arthur Blech of Los Angeles , said there was no capital gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of them from the IRS and two from the joint committee , have interviewed Blech and questioned him about the decision , the sources said . At least one committee staff member has been assigned full time to investigating Nixon 's deduction of $576,000 claimed for the donation of his papers while Vice President . The deduction saved the Nixons $235,000 in taxes . In making his tax returns public Dec . It , Nixon disclosed that he paid $72,682.90 in inetime tax in 1909 ; 5792.81 in 1970 ; $870.03 in 1971 , and $4,290.17 in 1972 . He ' later asked the joint committee to review the deductions for the land sale and the gift of his papers , saying he would abide by the committee 's decision . SPOKESAIEN SAID the investigation will be entirely different from the run-of-the-mill income tax return audit conducted by the IRS , largely because the joint committee is participating along with the IRS . Usually , an IRS field agent or an audit officer makes the audit . and his decision stands . If it is a big corporation being audited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may decide the taxpayer owes inore money or is entitled to a refund . If the audited taxpayer is found by the auditing agent to owe more taxes , he may have a district conference and appeal its decision to the IRS appelate division where the government 's best tax experts make the final decision . FROM TilEN ON . the taxpayer can pay the bill and file suit for a refund in Federal , District Court , or he can leave the taxes unpaid and file suit contesting the government 's claim in the United States Tax Court .
