txt The Albany agreement on a new municipal tax package , inappropriately linked to a state school aid program , reflects little credit on the principal negotiators . The $330-million tax package that is expected to be approved by the Legislature today does not solve New York 's immediate budget problems and it raises serious questions about the city 's fiscal future . Senate Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton forced on the Democrats a school aid bill that is both unjust in its bias toward less needy suburban school districts and unsound in its failure to provide new revenue support . Mayor Beame played an equally cynical game relying on what increasingly appears to have been a deliberately orchestrated municipal police , fire and garbage crisis in order to force the Legislature and the Governor to act on his demand for new taxation . Added to a $350-million boost in the realty levy already enacted , the proposed new taxes would also represent a 10 per cent increase in the total levy on the highest taxed municipality in the nation . Though such increases might appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every new tax now imposed in New York can only exacerbate the already alarming flight of businesses , jobs and people from the city . The most disturbing aspect of the Mayor 's dogged commitment to higher spending and taxes is his persisting failure to address forthrightly the principal single source of the fiscal crisis  --  runaway payroll and pension costs . Although this is one of the few areas where the city could  --  and must  --  make significant savings , Mr. Beame so far has refused to stand up to the insatiable municipal unions on the city 's behalf . Instead , through threats of wholesale firings which are too wildly impractical to be taken seriously , he has allied himself with the unions to extort new concessions from the taxpayers . Rather than offering city workers the logical choice  --  between job security and increasingly lavish benefits  --  he has misled them into believing that they can continue to enjoy both indefinitely . Even the ingenious offer by Victor Gotbaum , head of the biggest municipal union , to defer the latest round of pay increases in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a metropolis already on the brink of bankruptcy . Borrowing to pay current expenses has been a major contributor to New York 's fiscal distress ; it will intensify , not ease , that problem to ask 1977 taxpayers to pay off , with accumulated interest , the wage boosts due now . Only an outright wage freeze for this budget year could truly operate to save civil service jobs . In fact , relentless escalation of labor costs must be checked if the city is to regain its fiscal balance . Mayor Beame 's . disappointing failure to live up to his preelection reputation as a tough and prudent fiscal manager imposes a special burden of responsibility on the City Council and the Board of Estimate who still must give final approval to any new tax program . Instead of slavishly rubber-stamping the Mayor 's package , as in the past ; they have the special obligation now of carefully weighing the potential impact of every proposed tax increase . A salary freeze at last year 's levels , as proposed by Councilman Edward L. Sadowsky , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs .
