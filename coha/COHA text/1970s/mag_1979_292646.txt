" It claimed , among other things , that the larger size would reduce by 5% the number of times a secretary needs a second page to finish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs 4.60 ( including charges for the secretary 's retirement benefits and depreciation of her chair and her typewriter ) . <P> Finally , the Congressional Joint Committee on Printing concluded that switching to 8 in. - by- 11 in. stationery would result in a net savings of several million dollars and ordered that the change be made by Jan. 1 , 1980 .
