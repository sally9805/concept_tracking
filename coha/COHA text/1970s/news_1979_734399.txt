Letters A Transport Bond Issue Calling for a Loud ' No ' To the Editor : The upcoming vote on the proposed bond issue for mass transit provides New Yorkers with a unique opportunity : It is a referendum on the fiscal irresponsibility and governmental malfeasance that provide us with high taxes and a low level of basic services . The daily operations of the Metropolitan Transit Authority are in a shambles . The bureaucratic-political cabal that administers it is a travesty . At the highest level , the authority is merely a dumping ground for the political refuse of successful gubernatorial campaigns . Recent allegations of impropriety in these pages indicate the crass indifference of middle managers toward the riding public . The handiwork of the line staff is apparent to those who daily ride in filthy subway cars and purchase tokens from rude clerks . A change in attitude and increased productivity , not a capital infusion , is needed . The past five years of fiscal crisis have provided ample evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York City alone is in excess of $10 billion .

The purpose of the Urban DevelopPresidential Failure On the Cuban Issue To the Editor : In a mid-September White House presentation , which I attended , President Carter conceded that ratification of SALT II was dependent upon clearing up the issues surrounding the presence of Soviet troops in Cuba . The chance for the President to face this issue squarely arose after Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko addressed the U.N . General Assembly and denounced what he called " all sorts of falsehoods being piled up concerning the policies of Cuba and the Soviet Union . " " This propaganda , " said Mr. Gromyko , " is totally without foundation in reality . It has no real basis , and it is indeed based on falsehoods . " In the wake of such effrontery , the President stated that the status quo of the Soviet " combat brigade " was unacceptable . Yet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo . The President asserted , " The Soviet Union does not admit that this is a combat unit . " He then repeated Soviet assurances that " Soviet pesonnel are not and will not be a threat to the United States or to any other country . " President Carter 's response pattern to Soviet behavior is predictable : Speak loudly and carry a little stick . The President should heed the admonition of the new lion of Idaho , Senator Frank Church , that Senate approval of SALT II would require " a clear statement by the President that Soviet combat forces are no longer employed in Cuba .

To quote Governor Hugh Carey , " The days of wine and roses are over . " D. LES SCHREIBER New York , Oct. 4 , 1979 To the Editor : As indicated in The Times , the 1979 transportation bond issue is in trouble . Even the most ardent supporters of public transportation , those who worked in 1974 to gain votes for the rail-improvement bond issue , are wary . Here are two reason why . ? The state is already collecting a gasoline tax of 8 cents per gallon . If a greater share of this fund were used for repair and maintenance of state highways and if the municipalities which generate the tax received a fair To the Editor : S.

" ) contained several serious misstatements of fact that should be corrected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " exacerbate inflationary trends . " Futures prices are a reflection of the current supply-and-demand situation for a given commodity . If the demand for a commodity increases , so will the price . Many industries use futures markets to hedge against erratic prices of raw materials in the cash market . If they were n't able to do this , they might be forced to pass on their increased price risks to consumers . That would worsen inflation . In attempting to draw a parallel with today 's silver and gold markets , the author states , " In 1973 . . . soybean futures soared out of control and reached $13 per bushel , with no end of this price escalation in sight . " Indeed , that was the end of that price escalation ? soybean futures reached $12.90 on June 5 , 1973 , and have never been that high since . That price rise was caused by real shortages at the time ? of U.S. soybeans , Russian sunflower seed , Peruvian fish meal and Indian ground nuts , all important sources of protein meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author implies that precious metals prices are higher than Concorde 's Benefit To the Editor : Everything you said about the Concorde being so costly a success as to be an economic failure editorial Sept. 28 is probably quite true , but the plane did do one thing : it provided the only sure way I know of to avoid that miserable 20th-century malady , jet lag . I am a Concorde repeater , and I would fly on her on every long flight , especially eastbound , if I could . It is wonderful to arrive after a 3,500-mile journey and be able to feel and function completely normally instead of like a zombie . It is a pity that such a boon to modern mankind has proven too costly to become widely or long available . EVELYN F.

' s purposes are to initiate new interstate highway projects that will entitle the state to the largest possible Federal funding on the 90/ 10 formula . This fund then stays with D.O.T . as a nest-egg for new interstates which the taxpayers must maintain . The Federal gift is a one-time handout . State aid to municipalities is only a tiny fraction of the cost of highway maintenance , by far the largest item in any upstate town budget . Furthermore , state aid for highway and street maintenance has been at a dead level since 1969 regardless of changes in amounts of tax generated or of inflation . ? Experience with broken promises after winning support for the rail-improvement bond issue of 1974 does not stimulate confidence in D.O.T . ' s 1979 plans for another bond .

Make no mistake ; if futures markets did n't exist , people would continue to buy gold and silver in the cash market , as they do now . In the current situation , that would mean fewer sellers for the same number of buyers , and even higher prices . The author asks , " What will the impact be on our economic and monetary stability if gold costs $1,000 per ounce and /or silver costs $100 per ounce one year from today ? " Since gold and silver prices are often barometers of confidence in the economy , a better question might be , " What will the impact be on gold and silver prices ? and all prices ? if our economic and monetary stability continues to be called into doubt ?

To the Editor : Our Congressmen and President seem to be moving toward committing at least $2 billion for construction of another large aircraft carrier . This indicates confidence that such a ship would be defensible in the late 1980 's and 1990 's . The 1973 Mideast war proved that missiles can knock out the most formidable tank . Within a few years a number of countries will have sizable inventories of anti-ship missiles , some of them , no doubt , nuclear-tipped . Is it prudent to pour billions of dollars into a single ship for such an environment ? Perhaps America needs a latter-day Billy Mitchell to test the vulnerability of these leviathans . RALPH LOVE New York , Oct. 3 , 1979 Commodity Futures ' Benign Role Let Huber Matos , Castro 's Prisoner for 20 Years , Be Free at Last To the Editor : Oct. 21 will mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most widely known political prisoner in Cuba . In the name of simple human decency , we call upon the Cuban authorities to release him on or before that date . The world should not forget the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Matos . A teacher by profession , he joined Castro 's guerrilla army and helped lead the revolution against Batista . He was a major in the army , the highest-ranking position , and led the attack in 1958 on Santiago , Cuba 's second-largest city . Thereafter he was appointed military governor of Camaguey province , in which capacity he instituted agrarian reform . But he soon chose to resign his position in protest against the growing Communist influence in the army and in the Government . " I do not wish to become an obstacle to the Revolution , " he said in a letter to Castro , " and I believe that , having to choose between accommodating myself or getting out of the way in order not to cause any damage , it is honorable and revolutionary that I go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was arrested and accused of treason . Castro himself was the prosecutor at the trial , delivering a seven-hour harangue that was broadcast over the state radio . He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and has never been amnestied . For periods of more than a year he was kept in solitary confinement in the dungeons of the Cabana Fortress prison . In 1975 he was able to smuggle a letter out to his wife in which he reported that he was " old and ailing , " had lost the use of his left arm and was almost blind . Mr. Matos is convinced that Castro will not let him leave Cuba alive . In a letter smuggled out of Cuba last fall , he wrote , " Castro is attached to the idea that something will happen to me before I can leave Cuba .. . . " His wife , terrified that he will be harmed , wrote to U.N . Secretary General Kurt Waldheim " that his physical elimination is being planned and that the accounts later will say that he died of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand , that there may be an attempt to frame him so that he will never regain his freedom , and , on the other , that an ostensible sudden illness or fatal accident of medical malpractice will take his life . " We appeal to Fidel Castro to let Huber Matos go free and join his family in the United States . As long as Matos remains a prisoner , he will be a symbol of political persecution and injustice in present-day Cuba . We who cherish freedom and human rights can not be indifferent to his plight . We expect that his ordeal will end when the period for which he was sentenced ends . He has completed his sentence . Let him be free at last .
