During the past 100 years Brazil 's 29 rulers have included Portuguese monarchs , populist revolutionaries , fascist generals and moderate republicans . Regardless of era or ideology , all have faced a common adversary : O Estado de Sao Paulo , Brazil 's foremost newspaper . On a continent where journalistic rebels perish quickly and most surviving publications are servile in spirit , O Estado stands out as a durable , responsible independent . The paper so treasures its freedom that last month , on the 100th anniversary of its founding , it publicly still admitted to only 95 years of independent existence ; the years 1940-45 are excluded because Dictator Getulio Vargas had seized control of the paper then . <P> Some Crusades . Before and after that interregnum , three generations of the Mesquita family have maintained the paper 's integrity . Politically , O Estado has remained moderately conservative . Thus the paper has retained a power base among the rich while occasionally fighting for progressive causes . Julio Mesquita , grandfather of the present director , Julio de Mesquita Neto , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the 1870s the paper crusaded successfully to abolish slavery . After the monarchy was overthrown , Mesquita supported the creation of a republic . Later , many regimes tried to suppress O Estado , and Mesquita was once imprisoned briefly in 1924 . <P> At his death in 1927 , his son , Julio de Mesquita Filho , assumed control and battled Brazilian governments in the ' 30s and ' 40s . Twice Mesquita Filho was forced into exile . By 1964 he was back in Sao Paulo wielding political influence himself . He plotted with the military to overthrow leftist Joao Goulart , whom he suspected of heading toward totalitarianism . Once in power , however , the new rulers turned authoritarian , and O Estado again found itself in opposition . <P> At Filho 's death in 1969 , his son , Julio de Mesquita Neto , took over the paper . He has continually defied the government 's request for self-censor ship . Instead , when the censors cut sto ries , he filled the blank space with excerpts from Poet Luis Vaz de Camoes epic work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paper has also resisted in other ways . <P> Its correspondent in Recife publicly identified the chief of Fourth Army intelligence ; the reporter was severely tortured , but finally let go . Other O Estado stories on student protests , strikes and treatment of political prisoners have brought pressures from the police . <P> Required Reading . Mesquita 's editorial page remains rigidly antiCommunist . It abhors any tinkering with private enterprise . But the news columns have a less conservative tone . The pa per 's liberal reporters are not compelled to follow the boss 's views . <P> The staff is large enough - 445 reporters , stringers and editors - to pro vide the most comprehensive coverage of any South American paper . Despite a dull format , the paper is required reading for Brazil 's professional classes . Such prestige brings in more advertising than O Estado can use . Though circulation is modest ( 198,000 daily , 300,000 Sunday ) , earnings this year may total $5.4 million . <P> The family could afford a jet-set life . But instead , Julio and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
