One day last winter Morocco 's King Hassan II and his trusted lieutenant , General Mohammed Oufkir , were in the seaside resort of Agadir , discussing an official visit by Libya 's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to nearby Mauritania . To the King 's astonishment , Oufkir suddenly proposed that the Moroccan air force be used to assassinate Gaddafi , who had never made any secret of his antipathy toward Hassan . " If only we could find out Gaddafi 's flight plan , " asked Oufkir , " what would you think of sending an F-5 to smash into him in the middle of the desert ? " <P> " Oufkir , are you mad ? " replied Hassan . " Even supposing we knew his flight plan , his altitude , his route and we hit him , you must realize that there would be an inquiry . They would find traces of bullets and rockets . In this area only Morocco has F-5s . Can you imagine the international scandal ? Piracy in midair against a chief of state ? " Then , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Oufkir , I absolutely forbid this business . " <P> THIS remarkable story of political intrigue-so similar in plan to the abortive coup that General Oufkir led against the Moroccan monarch himself two weeks ago-was recalled by King Hassan last week as he told of his narrow escape from the aerial attack on his plane . When three Moroccan air force F-5s opened fire on the King 's Boeing 727 jetliner over the Mediterranean , Hassan related , it was this scene with Oufkir that flashed across his mind " immediately , just like a film . " <P> Hassan had summoned newsmen to the Royal Guest Palace to reveal details of the attempted midair regicide . The King portrayed his Defense Minister , whom he had considered his most loyal supporter , as a chronic plotter of palace intrigue . Earlier , Hassan had claimed bitterly that he had protected Oufkir " beyond all reasonable bounds , " and had even " endangered our relations with France " when he refused to extradite Oufkir for the Paris kidnaping and presumed murder in 1965 of Moroccan Leftist Mehdi Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Oufkir was proposing the assassination of Gaddafi he was already plotting the attack on Hassan , according to the King . The scheme , in fact , was hatched only four days after army cadets stormed the King 's summer palace last July . If Oufkir had a hand in that affair , it was never revealed . But he kept the King 's confidence by ordering the summary execution of ten high-ranking officers ( who , had they lived , might have implicated him ) .
