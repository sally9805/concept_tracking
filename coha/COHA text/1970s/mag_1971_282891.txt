When Edmund Muskie recently told a group of black community leaders in Los Angeles that " if a black man were on the ticket , we would both lose , " few of the ensuing denunciations were as piously outraged as Richard Nixon 's . He scornfully condemned his potential challenger for committing " a libel on the American people . " The President apparently forgot that in 1968 he had made a similar comment about the possibility of a Jewish running mate . According to Chicago Sun-Times Columnist Dave Murray , during a pre-convention off-the-record meeting with several reporters and editors , Nixon was asked whom he would choose as a running mate if he won the nomination . Nixon ran through a list of possibilities-not including Spiro Agnew-and then , according to Murray , someone proposed New York Senator Jacob Javits . Nixon thought hard , recounts Murray , then said no . The country , the President-to-be explained , " is n't ready " to elect a Jew to national office . Now a question arises : Who libeled whom ?     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
