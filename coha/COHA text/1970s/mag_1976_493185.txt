Their undergraduate expectations , tinged with unrequited hopes of Camelot , have become , across a decade of war and political scandal and cultural disequilibrium , the cliches of a vanished age . They were when they started out , by the standards of birth and education and the IQ tables , according to the letters of recommendation and their college entrance scores , one of the most remarkable , imaginative , self-sufficient and well-rounded groups of young men in history .

Home town newspapers ran column-long articles reporting their transformation from high school student body presidents into Harvard Men . Pretty , bright girls at Wellesley and Bryn Mawr and Vassar competed for their invitations to the Yale game . Henry Kissinger and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Samuel Huntington waited to give them tuition in the management of the American century .

They had considered it , like the letters of acceptance that followed , the external vindication of their own inner logic . As it had been for him , so inevitably , it would be for them . Ahead , life spiralled upward like a staircase ? an elegant , curving , richly carpeted staircase , not a ladder , not a slippery pole ? toward the complete fulfillment of every inner ambitions , even the White House itself . Harvard was not just the first step . It was proof of that inner sense of predestination they had felt in Haverford and Palo Alto and Needham and Chevy Chase , and all the other pleasant places from which they had sprung , and to which they felt quite superior . Langdon Gates Burwell ' 66 stepped on a land mine , less than two years after graduation , near Danang , during the Tet offensive .

" This , the Harvard class of 1966 , 10 years out , seems unwilling , perhaps unable , to do . Their trust in themselves remains a God they can not quite believe has failed . They may no longer rely on their own insights . But they record them with compassion , and communicate them to each other with care . There seems still to live on beyond the well-delineated boundaries of a hundred suburbs with wide lawns and good school systems , not yet drowned out by the rattle of a thousand commuter trains that always run a few minutes late , the sound of a different drummer , the belief that everything so far has been a repairable mistake , that their ways some day will be acknowledged , their paths to the Harvard promise once again made straight as a super highway .

" " The ' 60s seemed to hold such promise and hope , " remembers Martin Renwick Severance , now an insurance broker in Brookline . " Needless to say , the intervening years have not fulfilled our dreams but rather , they have fallen far short of the mark . " Needless or not , Ernest Bassay Attah , also ' 66 , like so many other of his classmates , has not only said it , but said it blank verse : The sage who painted the canvas on my wall is obscure , unknown to the consuming public of art But i know that he knows the delicate point of balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have been , these 1150 men with Harvard degrees now entering the first rolling foothills of middle age , poised on that delicate balance for a very long time , since they were teenagers in fact . And after 10 years of wear and tear and war and Watergate , what seems most extraordinary about them is not the imperfection of their anguish , which was discernible years ago , but the persistence of those hopes they unpacked in their freshman dorms back in the autumn of ' 62 . In truth , things began to go wrong for the members of the class of 1966 before they completed their first semester , and ever since they have seemed nonetheless to beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . In the beginning of their freshman year , the midnight disputes . over the significance of Kierkegaard , the bedtime recitations of Rimbaud , the debates on Keynesian economics , the gin-drinking contests and the four-day bridge tournaments all ceased as they shut off the Vivaldi on their stereos , and turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to an end before Thanksgiving . Armageddon did not follow the Cuban missile crisis , but another kind of holocaust did . A year later , shortly after they moved into Eliot and Lowell and Dunster and all the other houses , everyone did nothing for three days except watch the television reports from Dallas . The magic bullet had killed the first of their certainties about themselves , and 1965 and 1966 ? following the flurry , in 1964 , of campaigning for Lyndon Johnson because he was the peace candidate ? were the years of the growing realization that you could get killed in Vietnam . There followed the quest for the perpetual draft deferment . It made law students out of aspiring poets , and doctors of philosophy out of undergraduate playwrights . It filled the villages of India and Peru and Nigeria with cum laudes in general studies , arrived as Peace Corps volunteers to teach the peasants how to grow rice . Ahead lay drugs , communes , drop-outs , riots , alienation , Cambodia ; the documents left behind , in the Pentagon papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , not the meek , would inherit the earth . Perhaps the class of 1966 never fully recovered from the sophomore slump that began with the assassination . Maybe they found the following years so traumatic not just because they discredited an order , but because it was an order of which they had imagined themselves the heirs . Whatever the exact nature of the burden , it has not been borne lightly . " Ours has been a double burden , " complains one alumnus , " the natural disillusionment of maturing with which every generation copes , and the secularnational disillusionment with our institutions and our society . " Alfred C. Butterfield limits himself to observing that he is still watching , " with what detachment I can muster , as human greed and wastefulness ravage this world . " Noel Willis Solomans , now an assistant professor of medicine , laments that the human condition they discovered after graduation exceeded even the capacities of an entire Harvard class to remedy it : " We found that the injustices were so woven into the fabric of our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christopher Mitchell , now an assistant professor of politics , agrees that " the ' 70s have hardly been what we 'd bargained for . " The present may not be what the class of 1966 bargained for , but curiously enough ? it is exactly what a sociologist could have predicted . Ten years after President Pusey officially pronounced them members of the ranks of educated men , their personal memoirs speak of lives disrupted by war and political upheaval , of spirits that have rejected the old values . The Harvard 10th anniversary report bespeaks a yearning for new freedoms , a contempt for the traditional rewards ? and for the old sanctions too . In their essays to each other about themselves , these Harvard men of 1977 laud the wilds of Alaska and the backwoods of Maine . They speak of backpacking through high mountains , and sailing on small boats across vast tropical seas . They praise the wisdom of the Orient and the manners of Europe and the purity of the Rocky Mountain air . They lament the lethargy of the old Northeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional wisdoms , the superficialities of the accepted symbols of status , the fatuity of turning life into a career . But the social statistics of the class of 1966 tell a very different story . It is the tale of a group that was overwhelmingly white and upper middle class and status-oriented , and which remains so today . Reading not their innermost thoughts , but their home and office addresses , the most striking thing is not the effect of the upheavals of the last decade on the Harvard class of 1966 , but that those upheavals have had almost no real effect at all . It is almost as though the class of 1966 had graduated in 1955 , as though the assassinations and invasions and investigations and rise of the counter-cultures had never occurred at all . It is as though , truth to tell , the only real difference between them then and now is not that society has failed their expectations , but that they all are 31 or 32 today , not 21 or 17 as they once were . In a supposed age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge from the Harvard report is simply how many bothered to contribute to it at all . In the end nearly 750 of the 1150 members of the class of 1966 took the trouble to open the letter from the alumni committee , read it ? and then compose often lengthy replies . And the class of 1966 did not just send back confessions about themselves . They enclosed checks . Their contributions made up one of the largest 10th anniversary class donations in Harvard 's history . Among a generation supposedly distrusting large institutions , only one member of the class explicitly refused to contribute ? and announced instead that he was sending the money to the Vietnamese reconstruction fund . Vietnam was another surprise to emerge from the reports . The Indochina war is supposed to have turned the class of 1966 into something of a lost generation . Yet only a few respondents mention the war as a personal experience ? rather than an abstract political issue . Only one Harvard man devoted most of his report to it . The reason is clear . The Vietnam war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard class of 1966 at all . Eighteen members of the class are now dead . But of those , exactly three were killed in Vietnam , all during the Tet offensive , one of the few phases of the conflict when non-combatant Americans were in danger . Many a medium-sized high school graduating class ? and almost all predominately black , ethnic or working class high school graduates ? lost a far greater proportion of their numbers in the war than Harvard did . Between 1966 and 1975 , indeed , a member of the class of 1966 was more likely to kill himself than be killed in Indochina . The vast majority of the Harvard men of the Vietnam war era never served in the armed forces at all . All those draft deferments seemed to have reinforced and not broken another pattern of elitism and privilege . A leitmotif of dissatisfaction with the normal calibrations of success runs through the entire report . But that has not stopped the sons of Harvard from accumulating them . Of the 800 or so members of the class whose postgraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly amazing proportion have opted for the traditional professions ? and avoided the arts , craft labor , and the risks of career independence . Among those 800 , there is one conductor of a symphony orchestra , and one professional cellist . There are 141 physicians . There also is one professional football player , one tennis pro and one mechanic . But there are 186 lawyers . There are three rabbis , one Catholic priest , a handful of Protestant ministers , a few journalists , one goldsmith , and one builder and restorer of harpsichords and pianofortes . No less than 241 members of the class , however , have gone on to earn PhDs or otherwise involve themselves in careers in education . Another 148 own or are employed by incorporated businesses . Investment banking , insurance , real estate and public relations seem the careers that are most trusted , along with management consultancy . The tumult of the last decade , in fact , seems to have affected the career plans of the Harvard class of 1966 in only one obvious way . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 35 of the 1150 now are working in the federal or state bureaucracies . Many favor environmental protection and similar fields . Two admit to being FBI agents . But not a single member reports joining the State Department and no one lists the CIA as his employer either . Where they choose to live is as instructive of what has become of the Harvard class of 1966 as what they do for a living . Addresses are available for almost all of them . And as a group the Harvard men show themselves , for all their discontent with America , reluctant to leave it . Within the United States itself they have been less mobile , in a time of population shift to the sunbelt , and more conservative where they choose to live than the nation as a whole . Only 83 live abroad ? the vast majority of them in Canada ( where none of them seem to be draft resisters ) and in three foreign cities : London , Oxford and Paris . Within the United States the concentration is even more striking . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amtrak corridor stretching from the Virginia suburbs of Washington to northern New England . Nearly 160 live in California . But this compares to the 206 who live or work in metropolitan New York City , and the 279 who are still in Massachusetts . More members of the class of 1966 still live in Cambridge itself , indeed , than in Los Angeles , Miami , Atlanta , Dallas , St. Louis , Detroit , Minneapolis , Denver , New Orleans , Cleveland and Seattle combined . As befits such a socially homogenous , professionally elite , geographically concentrated group , the 1966 sons of Harvard share other broad interests besides coping with their subliminal angst . Many report they sing in choral groups ; a surprising number dwell on the joys of gardening . The difficulty of giving up smoking , along with constant references to racquet sports and sailing punctuate the concern with the fact , as the class president , Barry Williams , puts it , that " my body is over 30 like the rest of you . " Most are married . Fewer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children , and only one of the 1150 , for all the protestations of inner turmoil , avowed that he was homosexual . Most , in spite of their objections to careerism , take great pride in their work . The one in 10 or so who has found Jesus , Buddha , TM or the Maharishi is less surprising than the fact almost none mention socialism , and that not a single one of these radicalized youths of the ' 60s calls himself a Marxist . If few have perished , many , very many , have published . Jonathan Dwight Culler has produced Flaubert : The Uses of Uncertainty . Barry Martin Simon is the author of Quantum Mechanics for Hamiltonians Defined by Quadratic Forms , while Peter Laurence Skolnick has given us The Definitive Book on the Art of Jumping Rope ( Jump Rope/Workman , 1974 ) . Keith Wayne Sadlacek is the author of How to Kill Stress Before it Kills You , and another classmate has rescued Providence from oblivion with Rhode Island : Forgotten Leader of the Revolutionary Era .

He is living in a tent up in New Brunswick while building a series of log houses , " an exact recreation of a Loyalistcommunity of the 1840-1870 vintage . " When not winning higher degrees , commuting to the office , building sailboats in their back yards , and painting , plastering and publishing , the Harvard class of 1966 seems to spend its time meditating on the failure of fate to correspond to their expectations of it , and on lamentations over what might have been . " The thing I miss most about Harvard , " writes Joseph Edwin Fortenberry , and attorney with a large firm in New York , " is the 1960s . The great misfortune is that the ' Glorious Revolution ' of youth failed to produce the Renaissance it might have . We have suffered , we are now suffering , we shall suffer , from the consequences of that failure , " he adds , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel nostalgic for the innocent hope we all shared that we should be as successful in real life as we had been in high school , " adds Charles , Edward Cerf , who describes himself as the president of a " corporation grossing almost two million dollars . " Wars come , lifestyles go . The world , as it was 14 years ago in Harvard Square , is still their oyster . But they remain unable to stifle their anguish that it contains so few pearls .
