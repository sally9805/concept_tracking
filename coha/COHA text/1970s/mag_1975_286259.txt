He Jesus Christ picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered the world . <P> - Bruce Barton , The Man Nobody Knows <P> Like Barton , Lawrence A. Goshon believes in the organizational efficacy of religious zeal . Indeed , Goshorn , 40 , chairman of a minicomputer manufacturing company named General Automation , Inc. , of Anaheim , Calif. , two months ago called together 1,000 of his employees to tell them he was dedicating General Automation to Chris Goshorn , a Southern Baptist who says he was sitting in his front yard one evening in 1969 when he quietly discovered Jesus , read a Bible passage asking his people to " turn from their wicked ways " ( II Chronicles 7:14 ) . Some in the startled crowd recall him saying , " The company is now in God 's hands . " One executive wondered if Goshorn had " wigged out . " In fact , behind Goshorn 's sudden move lay a convoluted tale of boardroom intrigue and a business slump that the chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer engineer , and a fellow entrepreneur , Burton A. Yale 44 , founded the company in 1967 on $70,000 . Sales leaped from $600,000 in 1968 to $61.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1974 , and company officials were predicting $200 million by 1978 . But in 1972 Yale left because of a heart attack and family problems , and in early 1974 Goshorn resigned as president ( though he remained chairman ) because overwork was ruining his 21-year-old marriage . <P> But the new president , Raymond J. Noorda , proved unable to market successfully computers that contained a highly sophisticated " silicon on sapphire " ( SOS ) semiconductor chip .

A. , could not make them standard for regular production . Sales slumped , and by the end of calendar 1974 the company was running at a loss . Noorda persuaded Goshorn to resume active direction of G.A . at year 's end , when Goshorn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old partner , Burt Yale , as an active director to run subsidiaries . Up to that point , Yale had shown no interest in religion and Goshorn had rarely talked about his faith within the company . But Goshorn soon introduced Yale to Melodyland Christian Center , a school and meeting place near company headquarters . Suddenly Yale shed 40 pounds , shaved off his beard and tacked up 22 religious pictures in his office . <P> Study Meetings . Both converts began proselytizing all over the plant . They suggested that executives read daily from Scriptures and hold weekly Bible study meetings in the board room ; they even ordered that a secretary be fired for dating a disgruntled minority shareholder who Yale thought was " possessed by demons . " On one occasion Yale came upon two engineers trying to heal an ailing computer . Says Yale : " I placed my hands on the computer , made a silent prayer and asked God to give the engineers insight to fix the computer . " Yale claims that it started up .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
