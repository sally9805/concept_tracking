For the past 2% years , International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . has been trying without success to find a buyer for its Levitt home-building business , which the giant conglomerate is under a Justice Department order to sell . Last week a buyer finally surfaced . He was none other than William J. Levitt , the 67-year-old creator of the celebrated Levittown instant suburbs , who sold the business to ITT in 1968 . Levitt signed a letter of intent to take the company back and said that he will operate it as a privately owned concern under its original name of Levitt &; Sons ( ITT had called it ITT Levitt ) . The deal , if approved by the Justice Department , will make the Company one of the few ever to enter the maw of a giant conglomerate and come out again years later in recognizable shape under its original owner . <P> All indications are that William Levitt is getting a bargain and ITT is taking a bath . ITT bought the business for common stock then worth about $90 Billion : most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of his repurchase will not be disclosed until federal trustbusters approve them , but trade estimates are that he will pay ITT no more than $30 million , and possibly as little as $10 million , to get the company back , And he will be getting back a much bigger company than he sold . Levitt &; Sons was a leader in its field when ITT bought it-it recorded sales of $94 million in its last year of independent operation - but ITT invested heavily to enlarge it , increasing sales to an estimated $250 million annually . <P> Why is ITT letting go so cheaply ? One reason , no doubt , is that Government-ordered divestiture sales rarely bring much money : buyers , knowing that the company has to sell , hold out for a low price . ITT agreed to sell Levitt , Avis , Inc. and other businesses as part of the violently controversial 1971 consent decree that permitted it to keep Hartford Fire Insurance . Another reason , though , is that the Levitt business , which had earned a profit of almost $4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million under ITT 's management last year . Home building is a business that demands quick , intuitive judgments , and it defeated ITT 's management style , which is based on incessant reports to Chairman Harold Geneen that are supposed to put everything in numbers . Says Levitt , who headed the company for ITT for a while but then left : " We are not the type of company that can be run with their methods . " <P> In order to take the company back , Levitt is coming out of a comfortable three-year retirement , much of which he spent aboard his yacht , La Belle Simone , one of the world 's largest . Now he intends to resume active management . " It has got to be restructured , " he says . <P> " From a decentralized company , it has got to be centralized right here " - meaning in his old office in Lake Success on Long Island , which he has kept all along .                  @ @ @
