Never underestimate the staying power of a wrong idea . Back in December 1974 , two Californians filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission , asking it to stop issuing licenses to new educational TV or FM radio stations that planned to devote their air time exclusively to religious broadcasts . The petition struck a substantial number of people as a diabolical assault on religious freedom , and an avalanche of protest mail began rolling in . <P> Now , more than two years later , the letter campaign has picked up new momentum-so that the FCC has had to add two extra staffers to clear out its clogged mailroom . On an average working day , the postman now carts in some 7,500 antipetition letters-for a total of nearly 5 million pieces of mail so far . <P> What really miffs the FCC is that there is no reason for it . In August 1975 , eight months after the petition was filed , the FCC summarily denied its requests . Thus the letter writers are flogging an issue that long since died aborning.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
