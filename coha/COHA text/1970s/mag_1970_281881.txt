Milton Avery was a man of few words . " Why talk when you can paint ? " he once remarked . And paint he did , often rising at 5 or 6 a.m. to turn out a few sketches before he had his morning coffee . He sketched the Connecticut meadows in bitter winter cold , the dunes and sea of Provincetown under midsummer sun , and Central Park in every season . By the time he approached his easel , his imagination was so disciplined by incessant drawing that on a good day he could finish off three paintings by evening . <P> Pruning Nature . Avery 's painting vocabulary was every bit as spare as his speech , a fact handsomely demonstrated in a retrospective currently on display at the Brooklyn Museum . The first since his death in 1965 , it was organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts , will move on to the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts . Avery reduced nature to its bones , pruning away all details until what remained was only the fundamental contours .

A solitary seagull plunging to its death is frozen midway between sea and sky , as timeless as both . All of this serves to make Avery 's paintings often seem curiously akimbo , as if somehow he had upset the balance of nature . <P> Yet he never denied nature its due . The peculiar shape of a Provincetown dune , playful as a paper hat beside the sea , was enough to inspire the surprising landscape , Dunes and Sea II . Birds particularly caught his imagination , perhaps because their sense of weightlessness corresponded so perfectly to his style . Sea Birds on Sand Bar was painted on Cape Cod in the summer of 1960 . With only a few brush strokes , Avery plainly described the sea , the birds , the sand bar , even while delicately suggesting the fragility of life . <P> The haunting seascapes of Cape Cod are Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife Sally , even the family dog Picasso , all managed to get into his pictures with delightful frequency . A cock crowing to the skies could stir him to chuckling humor , while the mere thought of fruit trees bursting into bloom was enough to inspire the pink color fantasy Spring Orchard . And when he tired of all other subjects , his wife remembers , he turned to himself , never failing to find something funny . One time he portrayed himself as a hobo in red ear muffs and raunchy tweed coat , another time as a wizened old man of the sea with cherry nose and stocking cap , and in still another he appears , a rumpled figure only just up , standing beside his bathroom . Overall , his subjects were " a domestic , unheroic cast , " observed the late Mark Rothko , who was one of Avery 's most devoted admirers and whose own art sprang from the same deep wellspring of silence .
