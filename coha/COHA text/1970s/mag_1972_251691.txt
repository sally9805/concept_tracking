WHEN , if all goes well , Apollo 17 's lunar module Challenger makes the final approach for a landing on the moon , it will let down toward a dramatic landscape : a wide valley guarded by three massive , well-rounded mountains that tower as high as 7,000 ft . " Once we 're there , " insists Apollo 17 's commander , Gene Cernan , " I 'm going to get us down . " He will have little margin for error : only a few miles downrange of Challenger 's glide path are the towering Taurus Mountains ; to the northeast lies the giant crater Littrow . Much as the landing site for America 's sixth ( and last ) scheduled expedition to the moon 's surface will test the astronauts ' piloting skills , it should be even more of a scientific challenge . A combination of ancient highlands and a younger lowland valley , the Taurus-Littrow* site promises to provide the moon walkers with two major scientific prizes : the youngest and the oldest rocks yet found on the moon . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative positions of the earth , moon and sun in early December , Apollo 17 , following the standard trajectory of the moon , would remain in the moon 's shadow for nine hours . The spacecraft would , in effect , experience a total solar eclipse , which would screen it completely from the sun 's rays and deprive it of essential heat . Thus , to avoid damage to Apollo 's systems , the spacecraft will be sent on a trajectory that shortens its " cold soak " to an acceptable two hours . The longer route will add half a day to the total flight time ( 85 hours ) . That change-along with NASA 'S requirements for the proper sun angle at the Taurus-Littrow site during landing-make it necessary to launch Apollo 17 at night . Early in the Apollo program , a night launch would have given NASA pause ; in the event of an abort shortly after blastoff , the astronauts would have to be fished from the waters of the Atlantic in darkness . But NASA now has such confidence in its launch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively safe procedure . <P> Apollo is scheduled to swing into lunar orbit at 2:49 p.m . E.S.T. Sunday , Dec. 10 . Next day , leaving Ron Evans behind in America , the command ship , Cernan and Jack Schmitt will climb aboard the lunar module Challenger , cast off two hours later and , at 2:54 p.m. , touch down on the black dust of the Taurus-Littrow Valley . Less than four hours later , Cernan will emerge from Challenger 's hatch . His descent down the lander 's ladder and the familiar post-landing activities will not be seen on earth . To save weight for scientific experiments and fuel for hovering , mission planners eliminated both the TV connections to the side of the LM and the bulky tripod on which the camera was later mounted . <P> Picture transmission to earth will begin about an hour after the first EVA ( for ExtraVehicular Activity ) begins , when the Houston-controlled color TV camera is finally set up on its mounting at the front end of the lunar rover .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
