Throughout his presidential campaign , Jimmy Carter pledged he would reform the antiquated and anarchic welfare system run by the Federal Government . At his first Cabinet meeting , Carter ordered HEW Secretary Joseph Califano to get cracking on a solution . Califano quickly assembled a 32-member committee-composed of Administration , congressional , state and private experts-and set out to produce a plan by May 1 . Last week , unable to get agreement on a single concept , Califano gave Carter four different approaches to the problem that were long on principle and short on detail . The President hopes to be able to choose one proposal , perhaps borrowing ideas from the others , before leaving for the London summit . <P> Carter 's basic goal is to devise a welfare plan that is fair and compassionate toward those who can not support themselves , while encouraging those who can work to get jobs . From the start , Carter has said that he would give no aid to someone who could work but refused to when given a good chance . <P> The HEW proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to provide public service jobs for the poor . The most comprehensive plan-and the one Carter is expected to adopt in some form or other-is known as Consolidated Cash Assistance with Jobs . It would cover almost 34 million people who now get some form of federal public assistance , although drastically changing the way the help would be given . The proposal would continue some federal programs , such as child nutrition and old age assistance . But it would kill others , including food stamps and Aid for Families with Dependent Children . The plan would also simplify the intricate " means tests " now used to determine who is qualified for welfare . <P> Long Struggle . To replace everything that was swept away , the HEW plan would provide a sort of guaranteed income at a minimal level-somewhat like former President Nixon 's Family Assistance Plan , which would have given cash grants to the unemployed and working poor . An urban family of four would have a basic cash benefit of $4,400 a figure 25% below the current poverty level as determined by the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow living with two children would receive $3,600 . But there would be a catch : to receive aid , every adult deemed capable of working would have to look for a job . If unable to find one in 13 weeks , he or she would have to accept a job created by the Government , and put in 20 to 32 hours a week . Sample jobs that would be set up : janitorial work , road construction and office clerking . Pay would be at the prevailing minimum wage level , which is now $2.30 an hour . For every dollar made by an adult , the amount of welfare received by the household would be reduced by 500 . For example , if the father in the four-member household was able to earn $2,000 a year , his family 's federal payment would be reduced from $4,400 to $3,400 . But his total income , of course , would be $5,400.
