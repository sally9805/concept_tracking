It hurts nuclear medicine <P> What does a hospital have in common with a nuclear power plant ? <P> Radioactive waste and the need for a place to dump it . Thus when Washington Governor Dixy Lee Ray early this month shut down her state 's Hanford dump , one of the three- such sites available to U.S. producers of low-level radioactive wastes , there was immediate concern in the nuclear medicine departments of hospitals and research centers across the U.S. Some nuclear power plants can use on-site storage areas for radioactive wastes . But hospitals and universities with limited storage capacity rely on regular pickups by private carters . For them , a wide array of vital tests may now be jeopardized . <P> Radioactive materials are essential tools in modern medicine . A radioactive form , or isotope , of cobalt is used in treatment of cancer . Radioactive isotopes of other elements are employed as tracers that enable doctors to follow the paths of substances through the body . For example , iodine 131 , given orally or intravenously , is accumulated by the thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device detects the gamma rays given off by the isotope and translates them into dots that appear oij a TV screen . Result : help in diagnosing such disorders as hyperthyroidism and cancer . <P> Each of these tracers produces only a low level of radiation and has a short " half-life " ( the time in which it loses half of its remaining radioactivity ) . Technetium 99m , a common isotope used especially for detecting brain tumors , has one of only six hours , while fluorine 18 , used in bone scans , is half decayed in less than two hours . Of greater concern are the isotopes used in laboratory tests . Among them : carbon 14 , with a half-life of 5,750 years . A large hospital may conduct thousands of radioactive tests and procedures daily , including those with carbon 14 , and produce enough waste to fill several dozen 30-gal. drums every week . But few hospitals are equipped to store this waste for long . <P> Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has warned physicians not to order any radioactive diagnostic tests that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associate Professor of Radiology William Briner warns , " We are on a three-week countdown on the use of radioactive materials . " Harvard University and the University of Washington in Seattle , which use the isotopes for bio-medical research , have curtailed some projects . Declares James Summers , a radiation safety officer at Manhattan 's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center : " If we ca n't get rid of the stuff , we 're going to have to cut back on research and testing ; we ca n't just fill up the basement .
