txt Several experts in government , labor unions , and private industry said today that the ' energy cutbacks outlined Wednesday by President Nixon could lead to depression-level tinomnInurnant An unemployment rate of up to 10 per cent can he avoided , these experts said , but only at the cost of abandoning clean air standards for up to 7 years , plus energy conservation measures far more severe than the President proposed . Among these measures , government officials conceded , are gasoline rationing . which they expect shortly alter Jan. 1 , and perhaps even limits on the amount of home heating oil allowed to each household . THEY DISAGREED with Nixon 's assurance that the fuel crisis " need not mean genuine suffering for any American . " . One Treasury Department official . who asked not to he identified , said there was " absolutely no chance " that the oil cutbacks proposed by Nixon could he accomplished without some increase in unemployment . The official , like most others in the government , said it was too early to predict how much unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said government reseatThers had just started working on ways to minimize the economic impact of the oil shortage . BUT ONE ' private analyst /***-3-6iefiles ' mmoc .. mmw 0 Bakersfield ELK HILLS NAVAL OIL STATION Santa Barbara Ventura predicted that the unemployment rate could go up to In per cent unless environmental re ! ; illations are waived for 5 to 7 years . The analyst . Stanford Field . director of energy economics at the Stanford Rese a r c h Institute in Menlo Park , Cal. , said , " If yo u waive the environmental regulations there need n't be an economic problem . " But if clean air standards are maintained . Field said : there would he " massive unemployment . " Whether Congress would suspend completely the clean air rules it adopted in 1970 appeared questionable . While the environmental movement is not as fashionable as it ' was then , environmental forces retain some clout in Congress , and they are fighting the administration 's proposals . And even the administration is not proposing a total waiver of the clean air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air pollution standanti would have to be done selectively . For instance , they said , clean , low-sulfur fuel should he sent to big cities , especially New York and Los - Angeles . where the air simply can not tolerate more pollutants . But power plants in rural areas , such as the Four Corners plant near the New Mexico-Arizona border , could burn dirtier fuel . TIIIS . HOWEVER . would require legislation , because the United States Supreme Court has ruled that plants can not significantly damage air quality even where the atmosphere is pristine . ? Field said that it was " possible taut not probable " that ? suspending the clean air rules could lead to health hazards in major cities . Even most of the more optimistic forecasters doubt that some economic dislocations can he prevented . If gasoline rationing and higher prices substantially reduce auto use , gasoline station attendants , motel clerks , and counter-girls at drive-in restaurants may be laid off . The same holds true for workers at factories making pleasure boats , tires , and recreational vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced as other jobs are created , some economists said . But that does not Mean tgat the individual person laid off will be able to find a new job quickly . The economists also feared failure for some gas stations , roadside restaurants and other businesses dependent on heavy use of cars . Even more serious , the ? experts said , would be a reduction of factory hours because of the fuel shortage . To avoid this , officials said , government experts are working on plans for " putting energy where it costs the least jobs , " as one said . He explained that some industries , such as the auto industry and chemical plants , would suffer more unemployment from a cutback than others . NEARLY ALL THE government experts agree that cutting residential use of energy would be least harmful to the economy . " Preventing the housewife from going to the store does n't hurt as much as preventing a truck from delivering parts to a factory , " one official said . For this reason , they said , they favor gas rationing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said one official , " it should have been done four weeks ago . " Setting up gas rationing would take at least 45 days , another official said , and government agencies are busy working on the plan-. ning . Another economic aspect of the energy shortage is a fear by some congressmen and liberal spokesmen that oil industry will reap windfall profits . REP . JOHN E. Moss ID. , Cal. warned that Nixon 's plan to tap the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California could lead to huge profits for Standard Oil of California . Moss said the company owns 20 per cent of the reserve and has pumped 25 million gallons from it over the years . He urged an excess profits tax on oil taken from government reserves . Elk Hills is one of four oil reserves . It was set aside in 1912 . It contains . 44,000 acres of land , and a year ago a government agency estimated it contained $3 billion worth of oil . Interior Department officials said the details of which companies would get the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the companies could claim a 22 per cent oil depletion allowance would be settled in the legislation Congress would be asked to pass authorizing development of the reserve .
