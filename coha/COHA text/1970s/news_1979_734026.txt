txt The White House is bracing for a heated debate over mandatory national health insurance . Within the next three weeks , sources say , President Carter will decide whether to endorse a comprehensive health plan , tentatively called " healthcare , " . or opt for a less costly , piecemeal approach . ? - Either way , Congress could balk . Liberals , led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts , will almost certainly pounce on the Carter plan for being too conservative . But many congressmen , alert to public concerns over higher taxes and inflation , are expected to question any plan that means more federal spending . ? The White House would delay the start of any plan until fiscal year 1983 , which begins Oct. 1 , 1982 . Moreover , the President wants to phase in such a program gradually over a period of years . The comprehensive approach , putting the whole plan into a single bill , is the most appealing to advocates of national health insurance . Voting for the entire program at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring together all the diverse groups supporting national health insurance . These advocates oppose the piecemeal approach , which would first adopt such widely supported proposals as " catastrophic " insurance . If only the most popular parts are approved first , the entire program would never make it through Congress , it is argued . The White House , however , is known to be seriously weighing the advantages of this one-part-at-a-time strategy . Among the parts the White House might choose to propose : ? ' Expanded medicare coverage . " The greatest crisis in health care today is in protection for the elderly , " says one Capitol Hill expert . At present , those protected under medicare ( protection is automatic when one receives social security ) are covered for only their first 90 days of hospital costs . After that , a patient must pay $80 a day for the succeeding 60 days and thereafter is left to his own resources . Many use all of their own funds and then are forced onto welfare , officials say . // From ? a ? e 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered by the states , fails to cover some needy people because of restrictions on eligibility . Administration officials would like to see broader definitions of eligibility , such as making it easier for two-parent families to qualify . ? Catastrophic coverage . One of the most popular proposals being discussed would help families cope with overwhelmingly large medical bills . One suggestion has been for the government to pay for all bills above $5,000 uncovered by insurance . An estimated 85 million Americans , including many who already have some form of personal health insurance , currently are not covered for extremely large medical bills . While federal catastrophic insurance would be one of the least costly aspects of expanded coverage , Kennedy supporters oppose it as a separate bill . They fear that if catastrophic in  --  surance is adpoted , many miMle-class citizens would think they had all the coverage they need , and other parts of national health insurance would lapse . Issue loses its zing Despite the emotional struggle expected in the coming months over health insurance , experts say much of the zing has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but 20 million Americans have some form of private insurance , which in most cases is provided by their employers . About the only people without some coverage are the poor , the aged , the unemployed , and marginal workers , say federal officials . For that reason , many national health insurance advocates today support plans that would simply incorporate private coverage into the overall federal scheme . Senator Kennedy , for instance , would require that employers provide private health insurance that meets federal standards . The government would then pick up the tab for those left uncovered . Federal price tag Cost estimates for federal health insurance are extremely slippery . Most supporters assume a federal plan would include some kind of federal price controls to hold down costs . Private employers who do not already supply adequate coverage , of course , could be socked with substantial additional costs . The Kennedy plan , according to figures supplied by the Senator 's office , would add to the 1983 federal budget $21.7 billion for care of the poor , the unemployed , and the elderly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion for drugs for the elderly . Thus , total 1983 federal costs would be about $31 billion above current levels .
