THE WARRIORS Directed by Walter Hill Screenplay by David Shaber and Walter Hill <P> The plot of this New York City gang movie is almost nonexistent , and what does exist is tedious . The large cast is wooden ; the language is flat ; the humor is childish , and the content would not engage the imagination of a lesser insect . Still , it is not so easy to consign The Warriors to the junk heap . Though The Warriors is trash , it is handsome trash . It excites the eyes even as it numbs the mind . <P> Director Walter Hill does not seem to know much about contemporary teenage hoods . The gangs in his film differ only slightly from the Dead End Kids of the ' 30s , the Jets of West Side Story , or even the Sweathogs of TV 's Welcome Back , Kotter . With a little help from a concerned social worker , these misunderstood kids could probably be college timber . What Hill does understand is the steely textures of urban nightmares . From its opening image-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky-to its final burst of gore , The Warriors offers a hallucinatory vision of New York 's deadliest nocturnal horrors . Hill creates creepy poetry out of menacing shadows , glinting switchblades , garish graffiti and charging subway trains . If enough people see this movie , it could sabotage single-handed the " I Love New York " advertising campaign . <P> Unfortunately , sheer visual zip is not enough to carry the film ; it drags from one scuffle to the next . Deborah Van Valkenburgh , as the love interest of the Warriors ' War Chief ( Michael Beck ) , provides a few libidinous moments ; a lesbian disco dance scene has its peculiar charms . But The Warriors is not lively enough to be cheap fun or thoughtful enough to be serious . Walter Hill , the talented director of Hard Times , the 1975 boxing movie , badly needs a direction to his career .
