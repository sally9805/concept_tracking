The heating oil run-up spurs sales of wood and woollies , and budget worries <P> Our Lady of Pity , a Roman Catholic church in North Cambridge , Mass. , had never before seemed so aptly named . Looking ahead to the coming winter , the priests were stunned to discover that their heating-oil bill for 1979 will make even the $12,000 they paid last year look like a bargain . To cut costs , they plan to close off the 1,100-seat main sanctuary during the cold months and hold services in the church chapel and chapel hall , which together can accommodate only 500 worshipers . Explains one priest : " It is simply a question of 45 gal . an hour to heat the big church against 6 gal . for the chapel . " <P> People throughout the nation 's Northern states are already gloomily pondering similar tradeoffs . Just about now , the owners of the 16 million houses , apartments and mobile homes-more than one-fifth of the U.S. 's housing-that use oil heat are getting their first big fuel deliveries . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel crunch has moved from the gas station to the furnace room . Since January the average price of heating oil has jumped from less than 56 per gal . to more than 80 , an increase well in excess of 40% . The country 's total heating-oil bill , about $10 billion last year , will rise by $4.3 billion . <P> This is a burdensome new " tax " that will worsen the already deepening recession by reducing the amount of cash Americans have for spending on all sorts of nonessentials , ranging from new cars and skiing holidays to Christmas presents and charitable contributions . A typical fuel bill for an oil-heated home , about $650 last year , is expected to climb to between $ 1,060 and $ 1,200 this year . In 1978 the average American worker had to labor for 19 hr. every month of the heating season to pay his fuel-oil bill ; this winter he will have to work a walloping 34 hr. per month . <P> Homeowners are using both simple and desperate means to cut oil consumption , everything from buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even whole floors for the duration . In Agawam , Mass. , Ernest Bleeck , 73 , a retired sales manager , and his wife Mary , 66 , spent $2,000 to build a greenhouse on the sunny kitchen side of their two-story frame house . In addition , they have placed several water-filled , 55-gal. barrels among their geraniums and lettuce plants where the sun will warm the water ; then the warmth can flow into the house through the kitchen windows . The Bleecks hope to reduce the 1,500 gal . of oil that they usually burn every year by as much as 20% . Says Mary Bleeck : " If we have sun , we can practically live in the kitchen .
