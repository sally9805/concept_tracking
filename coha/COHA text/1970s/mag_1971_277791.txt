In his battle against inflation , President Nixon has shunned the ultimate weapon of a wage-price freeze . " Such controls treat symptoms and not causes , " he has argued . Besides , he says , they do not work , are inequitable and incompatible with a free economy . Last week Nixon bent his principles to fight raging inflation in the nation 's largest industry . Carefully avoiding rigid controls , the President imposed what he called a largely voluntary " system of constraints " designed to stall the wage-price buildup in construction . <P> Although the constraints may very well fail , Nixon picked the right target . Building costs have jumped 12% during the past twelve months , partly because the unions in 1970 won pay increases averaging 18.3% for the first year of their new contracts . The high settlements have become a source of envy and a goal for other unions . <P> Bit by bit in recent months , the toll of inflation has dragged a reluctant Nixon toward an incomes policy . In his latest move , the President established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . His executive order called on labor and management to set up " craft dispute boards " to review collective-bargaining agreements in each of the 17 construction trades . The boards ' findings will be scrutinized by a twelve-man Construction Industry Stabilization Committee drawn equally from labor , management and the public . The 6% ceiling is somewhat elastic ; it could be higher in some places if " equity adjustments " restore traditional pay differences among crafts . Should the reviewing authorities find any increases to be too large , the Government may refuse to award federal building contracts in the affected locality , or it may ignore the new rates in determining fair wage standards for federal projects . <P> The President set no criteria for contractors ' price increases . Instead he bucked the job to a new Interagency Committee on Construction , which will also devise standards for management pay , bonuses and stock options . As a concession to labor , Nixon rescinded his mid-February suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act , which requires that local " prevailing wages " be paid on all federally aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while contractors complained that it would have scant effect on this year 's wage contracts . <P> Nixon 's new plan pleased contractors , though they would have preferred a wage-price freeze . In a public statement , the building unions denounced the order as " fundamentally unfair in applying strict controls to wages and a vague procedure with respect to profits and prices . " Privately , union leaders were somewhat more conciliatory , offering to give the plan a fair trial . Many labor chiefs are embarrassed at some of the extravagant pay increases won by headstrong local union leaders , but under the Landrum-Griffin Act they have little power to intervene . Their publicly stated indignation at Nixon 's plan is partly a gesture intended to show militant members that they put up a fight .
