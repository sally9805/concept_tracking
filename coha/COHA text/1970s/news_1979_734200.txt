txt Everywher President Carter looks around Washington these days , there is Sen. Edward Kennedy . He was there again May 14 , at the head of 65 organizations , in the great marble Senate caucus room , challenging Mr. Carter to join the drive for a " comprehensive , universal , national health insurance " program to pay for $211.4 billion of proposed services . Mr. Kennedy argued that " four years after passage " the new system would cost less than the present combined public-private health system and he challenged what he called Mr. Carter 's " piecemeal approach . " " And we call on President Carter , " he said , " to join with us to make quality health care a right for all our people . " Mr. Kennedy was not only challenging Mr. Carter but also the prevalent political supposition , that there is a drift to the conservative right that has foreclosed the launching of massive new social welfare programs . In the jam-packed caucus room were representatives of labor , welfare , church , charitable , and farmer groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old New Deal hard core of liberal followers .

The Carter plan has not yet been introduced in Congress . // From page 1 Carter sees Kennedy everywhere these days US Rep. Henry Waxman ( D ) of California followed Mr. Kennedy at the news conference . Mr. Waxman is chairman of the House committee that soon begins hearings on rival programs . He appeared to throw support to Mr. Kennedy . Lane Kirkland , AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer , urged Mr. Carter to support the proposed " compromise " bill : " That would be an affirmation of a pledge President Carter made during his campaign and repeated upon his election . " Failing such support , he told the crowd , " We must go our own way . " Mr. Kennedy seeks to counter fears of inflation by asserting health costs now are skyrocketing . " The American health care system is not strained to the breaking point by runaway costs . The issue of costkcontrols must be faced now .
