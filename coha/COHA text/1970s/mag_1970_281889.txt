" It 's awfully damned early to get up , " says Alan Otten , Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal . " You get ragged and your wife gets irritable . " But Otten continues to rise at 6:30 several mornings a month for " Breakfast with Godfrey . " The lure is a chance to fire questions at a politician before the sleep is out of his I 's . <P> Named after Godfrey Sperling Jr. , news manager of the Washington bureau of the Christian Science Monitor , " Breakfast with Godfrey " has become a Washington institution . Since 1966 , when he invited his old friend Charles Percy to lunch with a few fellow newsmen , Sperling has organized 121 breakfasts , including three last week . Invariably , they are held at 8:15 in the President 's Room at the National Press Club . Only 20 reporters-the number that fits the table-are invited . Invariably , the guest finds that he is the main course as the newsmen grill him for 75 minutes . <P> Most of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among them : Hubert Humphrey , George Wallace , George McGovern , Henry Kissinger , Daniel Moynihan , Walter Reuther , Sam Yorty and John Lindsay . John Ehrlichman , paying his third visit last week , generated plenty of copy , including a Page One lead in the Washington Evening Star : " President Nixon 's chief adviser on domestic affairs hinted today that the White House is considering seeking a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia . " Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News noted in his story that " Ehrlichman provided a rare glimpse into the President 's attitudes and work habits . " <P> Ground rules vary . A guest may talk on the record or he may use various camouflage devices like " an Administration " or " White House " source . " Basically , they 're all on the make one way or another , " says Lisagor . " The White House guys come over to scrub Nixon 's image and get rid of any warts that seem to be developing . And we try to use them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group . " Adds Sperling : " The great advantage is that we can follow up questions and keep boring in . At White House and other news conferences , you do n't get to ask the follow-up questions . " <P> Most breakfasts produce at least ideas and occasionally major stories . HUD Secretary George Romney laid his housing program , Operation Breakthrough , on the Sperling table . Equally memorable are the breakfasts at which Spiro Agnew said Humphrey was soft on Communism and Bobby Kennedy agonized over whether to seek the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination . <P> A few newsmen , finding no openings around the breakfast table , have set up their own group in opposition . " We were really getting clobbered , " recalls Jack Germond , Washington bureau chief for the Gannett newspapers . " So in self-defense we set up ' Political Writers for a Democratic Society . ' We 've had about eight or nine dinners , with people like Finch , Rogers Morton , Muskie. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
