AMERICAN SCENE <P> THE statistics have been recorded and the books shut on the devastation caused by tropical storm Agnes two months ago : 118 dead , 116,000 dwellings damaged or destroyed , more than $3 billion worth of property damaged , 206 counties and 27 cities turned into official disaster areas . But the private suffering of its victims is more difficult to measure and-so far-without end . TIME Correspondent Marguerite Michaels recently visited Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , in the area hardest hit by the storm . Her report : <P> The brown mud from the Susquehanna River has now dried to a white dust . It settles over everything and rims the eyes red . Only 10% of downtown Wilkes-Barre , once under 5 ft. of water , has reopened for business . Piles of debris still clutter the streets . Skulls and limbs washed from the Forty Fort Cemetery are still turning up in backyards . Block after block of houses have been gutted so that you can see from the front yard through to the back . Shrubbery has turned brown-gray ; lawns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,000 families still left homeless in the Wyoming Valley , only 7,100 have been housed by HUD . Some remain camped in the evacuation center an hour out of town . Others are living in the partially damaged second floors of their houses , without water or electricity . Most are still with friends or relatives in quarters so cramped that they are fast breeding enemies . The elderly were the hardest hit . Almost a third of those affected were over 55 . Many are living in hotel rooms until HUD can move them into mobile homes or new apartment buildings that have been designed for them . <P> HUD is now delivering 120 new trailers a day , and is still far behind the demand . But the majority of Wilkes-Barre citizens hope one day to repair or rebuild their own houses . Many Wyoming Valley residents are of Polish and Slovak stock . Their hearts are in their homes ; to possess a home is to possess everything . And they are the core of the movement to bring the valley back . <P> Frank Nowak , 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lucky because his house is still standing . He figures it will take a $22,000 loan to rebuild it the way it was . Thumbing through an album showing the house before the flood , with its trim lawn and clipped rose garden , Nowak says : " If I get this place fixed up and somebody comes knocking on my door to say urban renewal is going to tear it down , there 's going to be a fight .
