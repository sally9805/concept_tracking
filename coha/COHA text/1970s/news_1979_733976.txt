txt NEW YORK ? If the .53 million haul of Cezannes stolen from the Art Institute of Chicago is found , it might be by New York police detective Robert Volpe , as he sips tea in same collector 's gallery . Something like that already has happened to Volpe , the " art detective " of New York , believed to be the only detective in an Amcr ; can city whose full-time duties are to stover stolen artworks . Volpe , 35 , is a 15-year veteran . He says he recovered VL.5 million worth of hot art last year . THE SPOT-OF-TEA recovery began with a New York television talk show on which Volpe appeared . Afterward , he got a call from a stranger who had seen the show . The caller said that eight years before , he had lost three graphics , including a $25,000 Rembrandt etching . There was no hope of revery , he said , but he thought Volpe might like to know about them . Volpe took the descriptions . A week and a half later , Volpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This detective hunts stolen art // collector . Proudly , his friend pointed to a new acquisition , a Rembrandt . As befitting a man of finer sensibilities , Volpe waited until tea was done . Then , , As gently as possible , he said , " That particular etching , I believe it to be stolen . " THE FRIEND PROTESTED that be had bought it three weeks Wore from a reputable dealer . Volpe described two other , pieces and asked if his friend bad bought them as well . The friend said sadly that he had . There remained the solving of the ' crime . " I trrced the stolen graphics back- , through seven legitimate dealers and collectors to a dishonest employe of the complainant 's firm , " Volpe said . " The cleaning staff had employed temporary help ' and someone had stolen the pieces and sold them to a local merchant for very little money . He did n't know what he ' had . But as they went on , they gained their price . " SO ITGOES Iti the finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , Volpe thinks , in the theft of three paintings of Paul , Cezenne Dec. 27 from a second-floor storeroom ' in the Chicago Art Institute . " ' The $3 million worth:of paintings , he says , could be " anywhere , " maybe " around the . world , " maybe " nearby , " or maybe still stashed in the institute . " It 's only speculation , but I feel that the fact " - that the Cezannes were n't on view means ' that the thief was n't just a visitor to the museum , " he said , adding the theft of the Cezannes ' seems less plowed than the theft of a $1 million Rembrandt painting Christmas Eve from a San Francisco museum . " It might have been convenient for someone to lift them the Cezannes , someone who is not a professional . The opportunity was there and maybe it was hoped that the theft would not be discovered . I have seen things taken from storage that go unnoticed for many years . " BUT WHY WOULD anyone steal works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of art theft ? as in the world of art  --  anything is possible . Connoisseurs , discriminating in their taste but not in their ethics , turn to the " contract thief " to steal what they may want for their own peculiar enjoyment or for resale . Such underground collectors are " not the norm " but they do exist . " I have heard statements that such famous works ' ca n't be disposed of , " Volpe said . " Well , they 've already , been disposed of  --  the fact that they 've been ' taken . " He said some masterpieces are kidnaped for ransom , citing the theft of a group of Vermeers in Europe several years ago . At that time he advised foreign police to expect a ransom call - and they got one . " WHAT NORMALLY TIRES place is that the stolen piece will r throt h a cooling-off period ; then a cleansing period in which it will change hands , maybe go from thief to a questiczz 3 charrcter , then to ? scmeor.e ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a gradual process until the art work may surface again in an auction gallery , a private gallery , a private collection  --  anywhere , " he said . As he talked , Volpe was constantly interrupted by telephone Calls at his desk in the police Property Recovery Unit . IN ART , he knows whereof he speaks ? not only as a cop looking to recover stolen property but as a lifelong artist himself . He sculpts in metal and can not separate cop and artist . " The artist is me , " he says . This duality has made him something of a celebrity in a town where celebrity status can help one 's day-to-day endeavors . Day-to-day , Volpe does what he would be doing if he were not a policeman  --  spending all his time in the art Ile visits gallery openings and museums and attends cocktail parties with the art set . The sometimes closed world of the art industry has confidence in him and often provides information , sometimes not directly , but , as befitting its own sensibilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information from " informants . " The phrase , he sniffs , is " too sleazy . " He thinks of it as " cooperation " from friends . His world may have its pilferers and ripoff artists , he says , but this is not vice-squad work . An investigator must . understand the people he deals with and gain their confidence , he insists . " If someone comes in very disturbed because he 's lost a Dali or Picasso or a Chagali and the police officer looking at photographs of the works has an expression of ' You 've got to be kidding , that ' ca n't be worth anything , ' it , hurts , " the detective said . " It 's like someone reporting a missing laved one and the cop looks at the picture and says , ' Gee , he 's homely ' , " he said . VOLPE , WHO HAS his own studio , says that much as one solves a crime in stages , he goes through stages in his own art . As he pounds his gilded beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal and stashes them . " When the artistic mood hits , I assemble them into sculptures . By welding and bolting , I recreate life . " Much as one recreates a crime .
