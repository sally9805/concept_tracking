A Chicago businessman charters a plane to fly over Texas ranch land while he scans the ground through binoculars , looking for valuable samples . A Fort Scott , Kans. , man fights off hissing rattlesnakes on his farm to recover a small piece . A tourist from Camdenton , Mo. , wanders through a live minefield in Israel intently snipping specimens . All of these " barbarians , " as they call themselves , are hooked on one of the more unlikely but fast-growing hobbies in the U.S. : barbed-wire collecting . <P> Lured by the dubious romance of the rusty wire , some 65,000 collectors are now in the field , many of them members of one of the two dozen local , state or regional barbed-wire associations . The Barbed Wire Association of La Crosse , Kans. , has crowned a Miss Barbed Wire and sponsors a world championship barbed-wire splicing contest . <P> Wide Variety . To the uninitiated , barbed wire is , well , barbed wire . But collectors know that there are some 1,500 varieties of the metal fencing , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands . Early manufacturers created a wide variety of prongs , prickers , stickers and other barbs . An expert can easily distinguish a brand known as the Dodge Rowell from , say , Hunt 's Double Plate Lock Link . Prices vary according to the age , condition and variety of the wire , and range from giveaways to more than $100 for an 18-in. segment . Rare varieties like the Hunt could go for $1,000 and up . <P> Barbed-wire buffs often rationalize their pastime by insisting that it gives them a sense of American history .

" <P> <P> Says John Wagner , a farmer from Sandwich , Ill. : " I did n't think it would take very long to get all the kinds there are . " Now , seven years later , Wagner has acquired 500 pieces , and is still collecting . <P> De Kalb , Ill. , which was a major manufacturing center for barbed wire in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with metal detectors , collectors forage through old farm land , overgrown ravines and even garbage dumps . Most obey a strict credo : ask permission before snipping a barb , and splice new wire in its place . <P> The less adventurous swap barbs by mail , using lists and catalogues published by barbed-wire associations . Hollis Gordon , a retired welder from Independence , Mo. , wrote to government leaders in foreign countries . His collection includes strips from Korea , Nationalist China and a specimen used in France during World War I. <P> As the number of collectors began to multiply , Bill Sloan , a rancher from Saginaw , Texas , decided that he could profit from the hobby . He began by selling $5 barbed bracelets , then abandoned that scheme when he received barbed remarks from women with knit dresses . But he has sold 14,000 sets of six swizzle sticks ( $12.50 ) fashioned out of 24-karat , gold-plated barbed wire .
