IT IS AN ARDUOUS road , the long trail from the dramatic precipices of the late Sixties to the everyday world of love and labor . Its crumbling macadam , wending through the encroaching forest , is worn far more by the rigors of New England winters than by any weight of passing traffic . Forgotten rows of stone amid the birch and maple recall a time when these were the fields and pastures of another America . Here and there , cellar holes and cemeteries cluster around abandoned mill sites , mementos of men who harnessed streams with stone and timber to create America 's first Industrial Revolution . Today the houses are far between , weatherheaten , and fringed with the trinkets of poverty ? the cords of firewood stored up against the winter , 2.1othesline8 flapping in the autumn wind , and rusting wrecks awaiting some unforeseeable use . The road from the Sixties twists and winds among them , turning to dirt now and again , then to deep , stony ruts which mark our powerful machines en ; ineered for cloverleafed ribbons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streamlined missiles of our highroads stand out awkwardly in their futuristic ) bsolescence . The concrete maze to which they belong , the once-proud achievement of our affluence , has turned out to be a Moebius strip , returning endlessly , pointlessly unto itself . Only the rutted tracks may still prove to lead somewhere Those who travel them are searching for a path we lost i ? hen how fast ? replaced whither ? as our passionate concern . Those rutted trails , leading back from the blindness of our Fifties and the frenzy of our Sixties , through an American past to an American future , are the roads of the farthing brotherhood of St. Joseph . To speak of a brotherhood may be presumptuous . The men and women who scattered from the cities of the Sixties to the hard and rocky land of their forefathers are bound by no religious rule , serving in no humble rhythm of prayer , labor , and praise as did the brothers of another age . For that matter , St. Joseph may seem a misleading patron to invoke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable master of the carpenter 's trade , dabbling in cabinetmaking and coopering in the manner of his time , a true pillar of blue-collar respectability in his small town of Nazareth ? a pity about that boy of his , but you know you just ca n't keep young people out of trouble these days .... For all that , the metaphor may not be altogether inappropriate . For a brotherhood need not grow only by the devout imposition of religious rule and a humble submission to the discipline of monastic hours . It can also be born of a shipwreck stripping men of the trinkets of pride and folly which separate them , of an urgent common need which renders those trinkets irrelevant . And it can also grow of faith and hope , but of that it is best to speak softly . Hope is the substance of things not seen , faith the evidence of things hoped for . They are intensely private , best spoken of through silence . Among the wayfarers clearing the roads back from the Sixties through the New England forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stands out starkly , justifying the metaphor of brotherhood . It is the unspoken faith , retreating behind a veil of silence , which justifies the invocation of St. Joseph , who , through his daily work , blessed the precious bond of love and labor which we had lost in the juxtaposition of meaningless labor and arbitrary rewards born of the proud affluence of our Fifties . That bond was our most precious inheritance , giving meaning to labor and reality to ideals , uniting the body and soul of America . It was also our most grievous loss in the years of peace and prosperity . The hubris of the Fifties and the frustrated frenzy of the Sixties equally reflected that loss . Labor without love produced an overwhelming , absurd affluence , love without labor an impotent , murderous rage . We had forgotten that it is labor . not rage . that gives reality to an ideal , that it is love , not affluence , that gives worth to the goods of this world . It would be vain to restore law and order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flag if we were to fail to recover the bond of St. Joseph , the redeeming fusion of love and labor . More than anything else , it is that bond for which the brotherhood is groping along the rocky fields and rutted tracks abandoned by its fathers . Follow one of those tracks with me . Though old daguerreotypes of the hillsides show endless pastures broken only by stone fences , you will pass through a dense , tangled forest of hemlocks and birches struggling high for a ray of sunshine : nature , too , will overcrowd land violently cleared and wildly overgrown . But as you pass the crest of the hill , you will come upon signs of fresh clearing . Here stumps are yielding unwillingly to ax and tackle amid high barriers of cut brush . The actual clearing is as yet barely wide enough to grow vegetables in their season , with some to spare for canning or drying against the winter , but the hog in its pen is busily rooting out next year 's plot . The geese hiss alarm at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the chickens go on scratching busily away . Here humans are once more struggling wayfarers , not the heedless lords of all they survey . The house at the end of the clearing speaks of labor unassisted by bulldozers and backhoes . The foundations are fieldstone , the sills roughly shaped oak ; the boarding rises emplaned to a square-pitched roof . Within , the single room centers around the glow of an iron stove and a kerosene lamp . It is cluttered with all the accouterments of daily living which a modern architect would tuck away in sectioned rooms and cubbyholes , centrally heated and electrically lit . Not so here : privacy would have to be bought at the cost of the lifegiving warmth of seasoned oak burning in the stove . The stepladder reaching up from the cone of light to a sleeping loft opens the only possible other dimension : heat rises through the loose ceiling , and you can carry up a lantern with you . Willa Cather , who is buried not far down the road , would understand . This shell of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a family , not a stack of modules into which humans are tucked with computerized efficiency . The room simply does not isolate ; even the plants hanging in the windows in place of curtains bind rather than separate the within and the without . There is only one note to startle Willa Cather : the half-finished walls are lined with books , rows and stacks of bound volumes ? children 's books , books of theology , chemistry , philosophy , fiction , as well as of farming and construction . The man who raised this house may once have been a chemist , a public-relations executive , or an engineer possessing a prestigious doctorate . At early mass , his erect posture and the bearing of a cultivated man still set him apart , yet the hands clasped in prayer are those of a laboring man , groping for the lost link between love and labor . It might have occurred to him , and then again it might not , yet he is a Brother of St. Joseph . T HERE ARE OTHERS , along other roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strag- gles uncertainly along a road dimly sensed in an ancestral memory rather than clearly seen and consciously laid out . At the bend of another rutted track , an ancient orchard is bearing fruit again . The tangle of dead branches has been cleared away . the brush scythed ; there arc fresh , hardy grafts on the old trunks , and crates spaced neatly for the harvesting . None of the four young men who restored the orchard is nearly old enough to have earned a doctorate , much less to have launched a business career and/or a cultural revolution . They were no more than the splinters that flew when the Sixties felled forests , too bewildered to distinguish between self-destruction and self-discovery , too insecure to admit that there may be a difference . Fragments of trite rhetoric still clutter their conversations : the street robbed them mercilessly of their full cultural birthright . Theirs is a quest not for a transformation , just for a toehold on reality . Yet they , too , have found their way along the rutted track to the stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for they are still too insecure to dwell therein ? is not a pioneering shelter raised by their own labor . It was old long before they were born , but , were it not for their care , it might now be no more than another cellar hole filling slowly with fallen leaves , brambles , and saplings . Now it is cluttered with orchardman 's tools , pots , bits of clothing , and all the flotsam of a house that is not yet a home . In a less pretentious age , we would have said that it lacked a woman 's touch . This is what the houses of the early settlers must have looked like before the women and children followed the men who had been driven ahead by the hunger for soil and soul . In God 's good time , they will follow here , too , but first the young men toiling in the old orchard must discover what they are seeking . None of them , I am sure , has ever heard of St. Joseph , yet surely St. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road across the mountain has lain abandoned ever since the motorcar displaced the horse and wagon . Follow its overgrown ruts , passing cellar holes surrounded by the remnants of old plantings , lilacs , red and white currants , gooseberries , an old apple tree or two . If you poke around , you will turn up a discarded block or the rib of a rust-eaten scythe . The house on the southern slope , amid a well-tended clearing , will greet you with a different mood . It has been restored with antiquarian care . Its core is two ancient log cabins , transported beam by beam in a battered truck from somewhere in Appalachia . Now those beams have been lovingly reassembled , chinked. and covered outside with hand-cut clapboards . The narrow windows are leaded diamonds of old glass ; each hinge speaks of hours of patient labor with penetrating oil , naval jelly . and emery cloth . The three young men caressing the ancient timbers back to life live in a spartan shell around .1 wood stove at the back ? home enough for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them work at a manual job somewhere in the vi cinity : their pooled wages provide foi incidentals like food and clothing anc essentials like pegs and hardware foe the house . A very different dedication ? yet they , too , belong to the wayfaring brotherhood that chose to leave the world behind in a quest for a unity of love and labor . There are others , though their number would be hard to ascertain . In the state of mind and economy of which Robert Frost spoke as north of Boston , their way of living stands out for the most part only by being voluntary . In other respects , they blend with their neighbors , for whom manual labor is a fate rather than a vocation . It would be easy to conclude that , in choosing that vocation , they are simply finding the level of their competence ? that , having filled their college years with psychodramatic self-indulgence , they were just not equipped to match the expectations of their imposing degrees . In some cases , it may even be true ? though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hiding from us something we badly need to see and hear . I have wandered along the rutted tracks , meeting people I had known , people I thought I knew , and people I had yet to come to know , sharing the warmth of their stoves , the intimacy of their lanterns , the work of their fields , and the hospitality of their tables , and have come away convinced that the far-flung , anonymous brotherhood of St. Joseph ? and , in light of James 2:14-26 , that of St. James has something precious and important to say to us all . Yet just what is it ? The brothers of St. James are not as articulate as their isolated predecessors , Ralph Waldo Emerson . IXralt Whitman , or Robert Frost . They are more numerous , but hardly enough so to be numerically significant . Even by the most generous of estimates , they represent no more than a minute fragment of those caught up in the maelstrom of the late Sixties . At least as many ? or , more precisely , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methadone maintenance , Salvation Army hostels , and marginal unemployment punctuated by jail sentences for vagrancy and petty theft . Both groups are numerically insignificant compared with the vast majority of their peers , who passed by somewhat delayed but altogether conventional stages through adolescence to an equally conventional maturity , making little impact on arrival for all the clamor of their journey . Whatever their flaws and virtues , the brothers of St. Josephcannot be presented as typical products of the late Sixties . Equally unconvincing are the attempts to present them as the wave or even a modest ripple of the future . To be sure , a crowded planet must develop a less wasteful technology and more modest habits of consumption than those to which we have become accustomed , but the work of discovery and reorientation must be done in the cities , where the crowds are ? together with the laboratories , universities , factories , and all the resources of civilization . Even if the brotherhood were genuinely self-sustaining and independent of the society it takes for granted , the woods north of Boston are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pioneering existence not only presupposes a sustaining hinterland , it also requires vast tracts of open land per capita . Presented as an example for the multitude to follow , the brotherhood of St. Joseph would self-destruct . Then what is it that the brotherhood oilers ? Recalling the roads I have traveled in the last eight months ? and the road we have all traveled in the past twenty years ? I would say lhat. more than anything else , the brotherhood is acting out a metaphor . T HAT is something rather less grandiose and more fundamental than a type or an example , though also something much harder to define . A basic metaphor , the shared image of life 's cohesion , can be quite ethereal , yet it is what binds a civilization and raises it above the level of dull preoccupation with the satisfaction of its needs , even on the highest levels of affluence and complexity , to the level of a culture . Those who act it out , as the cultured homo Aurnanus did for ancient Rome or the monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as few as the cowboys and frontiersmen who acted it out for the America of another century . Yet their role is crucial : in acting out a metaphor , they provide a community with a beacon , a set of reference points which serve to fuse its acts and its ideals . A living metaphor is not just an act , limited to its own intrinsic significance . Nor is it just an " ideal " ? that can be no more than a vain illusion or a self-justifying rationalization . Rather , it is the symbolic fusion of the ideal and the actual which makes persons of the naked apes and a people out of persons . The America of our postwar " peace and prosperity " seems , in retrospect . a land that had lost its basic metaphor . It had ideals aplenty : the Eisenhower years abounded in noble rhetoric , promising freedom to the oppressed , plenty to the deprived , and , most of all , perennial rewards to ourselves for our own virtue . Yet that lofty rhetoric remained largely irrelevant to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomed , living standards soared . But it was a pointless , self-serving affluence which had little relation to our professed aims and ideals . At the time , the few who noted the schizophrenia of our acts and ideals were little heeded . For a people living down the deprivation of the Great Depression and the effort of the war , effortless ideals and even pointless prosperity were enough . The foss of a unifying metaphor passed largely unnoticed . It was our children who , in good faith , seized upon and exploited the dichotomy of our ideals and our acts . We had given them everything except a metaphor , the ability to see the continuity between love and labor . That continuity is evident enough when it is acted out by a father who goes out to the woodshed on a stormy night and comes back , hands chapped and raw with cold , bearing an armload of freshly split wood for the stove . It becomes immensely difficult to discern when father disappears with the morning rush hour in pursuit of some incomprehensible activity while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's touch of the thermostat . The villain is not technology : technological complexity has been with us , increasingly , ever since humans first used hues rather than hands to dig up roots . As it grows complex , it simply makes the task of keeping the unifying metaphor clear and fresh ever more urgent . That was a challenge we did not meet . In the age defined by the separation of love and labor even false prophets became credible . It became easy to see labor as a pointless obsession of compulsive men which should be left to machines , it was easy to believe that love requires no more than noble sentiments unsullied by effort . It required no conspirators and agitators ? though they were not lacking ? to produce the paralyzing schizophrenia with which America responded to the crisis of Vietnam , responding with shipments of purposeless materiel and outbursts of henzied rhetorical idealism to a situation which , more than anything , required the subordination of materiel to an ideal and the translation of ideals into purposeful effort . The conspirators and agitators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites : America , our America of the Fifties , had itself nurtured the twin incubus of the late Sixties . HE SIXTIES exploded in a frenzy of pointless production and impotent idealism because the Fifties had obscured the metaphor which binds love and labor . A generation for whom heat was an inalienable right assured by touching a thermostat quite understandably reject-3d with supreme scorn what it per-eived as the obsessive work ethic of heir fathers ? and equally understandtbly felt betrayed and rejected when , oming of age , it found itself without a mother to turn up the thermostat or nend its clothes . It turned to cold-wa. er Rats and torn clothes in the name of an idealism which , alienated from he labor which makes love effectual , to less predictably turned to frustraion. rage , and self-destruction . With ) ut a unifying metaphor , love without abor turns to hate , labor without love o drudgery . The collapse of the " etdural revolution " was as tragic as it was ifedictable : it was the application of he dichotomy of the Fifties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never exploded , never smashed a window , sold an ounce tf heroin , staged a demonstration , or aised the banner of the successive " he.oes " of the revolution , from Che Gue'ara to Chairman Mao ? There were o many who , all through the Sixties , . ept the faith , kept the home fires burnng and the homely cliches clicking . ; corned and scoffed , they labored paiently , cherishing and preserving the tomes their children were abandoning , truggling to preserve the civilization %. hich their children were so ready to lestroy in their innocent self.righteoustess . Patiently and not so patiently hey carried on the labor which paidthe price of the " liberation " in whose name their children ( with their aging sycophants ) derided them as drudges . What of them ? In a way , the collapse of " the movement " should have been their hour of triumph . For , after all , in their way they had prevailed . They had preserved what they had sought to preserve . Unlike the survivors of other revolutions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where only Draconic discipline and arbitrary force can preserve the barest wherewithal of human coexistence . Instead , they are inheriting a still functioning society capable of assuring them of both freedom and security . Unlike in the aftermath of almost any revolution , the judicial system , the processes of government , the educational system , the economy have been preserved ? and that is no small triumph . Yet along the rutted tracks where dwells the brotherhood of St. Joseph you will meet not only the former rebels but their erstwhile opponents as well . In the house one of them raised on an ancient mill site there lingers something of the neatness of the suburban dreams of the Fifties . Up on the half-loft , there is a large desk with a typewriter and a drawing board , surrounded by a working scholar 's library . The labor of scholarship goes on here , patient and undramatic , as once it did in a suburban home or a city apartment . Here , though , the desk is lit by a kerosene lamp and the heat rises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mudroom is cluttered with the same axes , wedges , saws , and splitting mauls . As you walk along the reemerging wagon road to the nearest passable highway , you pass the same signs of a man returning to long abandoned land . The orchard is being cleared , there are the same piles of brush and cords of split wood with a promise of future vegetable gardens . The man who raised that house was one of those who toiled on while the Sixties erupted around us , one of those who cherished and preserved all that the Sixties sought to destroy ? one of those who might be said to have " triumphed . " Yet for him , as for so many , that triumph turned hollow , the strenuously preserved , precious shell of a life turning empty and crumbling in the hands that for so long strove to preserve it . For the sickness of the Sixties was not only the revolt of impotent and so destructive " idealism , " it was also the sickness of labor which , in its persistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puritan ethic , which is precisely a fusion of love and labor , but its bifurcation . Today , this man , too , is one of the brothers of St. Joseph and Se James , seeking the metaphor which would heal the rift . The culture shock on returning from north of Boston to the cities is tremendous . It is not simply the dirt , the noise , the frenzied , unreflecting clamor of empty ideologies and loveless labor . The roots are deeper : the old pressures are still there . There is still the government and the corporations , one pressed , the other pressing to interpose themselves between our love and our labor . There is still the self-justifying production and the self-righteous rhetoric , the emptiness in place of a unifying metaphor . Yet the cities , too , are changing . It is no longer unquestioningly self-evident that big is beautiful and radical is right , or that anonymous labor is its own virtue while rewards are " rights " that ought to be equally anonymously bestowed . Growth to more mature humanity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be rapid and radical . Yet it may not be insignificant that tenement dwellers are rehabilitating their own housing , that governments are becoming concerned with the quality of our environment , or that corporations are speaking of ? and , who knows , perhaps even considering ? the social utility of their products . Nor is it insignificant that the Americans , including the urban Americans , selected as their President , after a father figure , a flashy playboy , a crafty politician , and a slick lawyer , a man whom they perceived , rightly or wrongly , as a small-town farmer . The change of mood is undramatic , subtle , and complex . Its causes and components are enough to keep sociologists busy for decades . But I am not a sociologist . I am a philosopher , and I have wandered the rutted trails north of Boston . I find it hard to avoid the impression that the most basic event is philosophical rather than sociological or economic ? that a new metaphor is imperceptibly reuniting America , the living metaphor of the brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
