txt THE OLD MAN sat , aristocratically as always , at the head of a long oak table . His arms were crossed just so . His head . was canted hack , so that he was staring down his nose . There are men who could look dignified even in the middle of a bawdy-house raid , and Alger Hiss is one of them ' Someone at the table asked Hiss about the new book , the one that " proves " he was guilty . " I did n't come here to rebut that particular book , " Hiss said . " It 's the 13th book written about my case , and I rather doubt It will be the last . And since I 've been helped in my fight for vindication by a civil liberties group , I 'd be the last to say Mr. Weinstein has n't the right to write what he thinks , " THE MR . WEINSTEIN In question Is Allen Weinstein , a Smith College historian , whose , just-published book exhaustively examines the most celebrated spy case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illustrious man . He 'd been a New Dealer , a State DeClose-up With Jeff Lyon ? partment official , and adviser to Franklin Roosevelt at Yalta . He had served as secretary-general at the founding convention of the United Nations . And then he was accused of being a traitor . In testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee , he was called a Communist fellow traveler who in 1938 had passed secret State Department documents to a Soviet agent . His accuser was an ex-Communist named Whittaker Chambers . Although Hiss maintained his innocence , he was found guilty , after two trials , of perjury the statute of limitations had run out on the actual crime and went to federal prison for 44 months . THE CASE ushered In the McCarthy era . It also made the career of a crass little opportunist on the House Committee named Richard Nixon . And it ruined Alger Hiss . He has spent 30 years trying to clear his name . It was Starting to happen for Hiss . It 's a plus , in these post-Watergate times , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weinstein 's book . Weinstein , who said he began the project believing Hiss innocent , studied FBI . documents newly revealed under the Freedom of Information Act . He conducted extensive interviews . His conclusion , after three years of research , is that Hiss lied and Chambers told the truth , however hard that may be for liberals and Nixon-haters to swallow . Now the book itself Is swirling in controversy . The Nation magazine has attacked it as a slanted misrepresentation of facts . True believers on both sides // qwq are lining up , as they have for three decades , to sift through every piece of minutia in the Hiss case and debate its merit , with the relish medieval scholars showed for computing the angel population on the head of a pin . AND IN THE center , a lean old man of 73 with lush white eyebrows who will tell you he 's Innocent with a Mona Lisa smile . " There is really nothing new in the book , " Alger Hiss said to the newsmen surrounding the oak table . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to file In a couple of weeks . I am going to court to expunge my case from the records , as if it never existed . " He is using a rare legal maneuver called " Ceram , Nobis . " " It is available to you when you can show the prose : cution overreached in an egregious way , " he ex. plained . " My counsel said he will demonstrate the prosecution in my trial was somewhat less than candid . We 'll show , using FBI documents of our own , that they were aware that Chambers was n't telling the truth . Our position is that exculpatory evidence was withheld and there was no evidence to support the charge . " IN MS IIALTING , old man 's voice , he began a pedantic dismission of the evidence . The typewriter , he said , the typewriter was different . We can prove it , he said . And we can prove , he said , that the FBI knew the documents had not come over my desk . Chambers said all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers could make it sound credible because six pages actually had come over to my desk , but .. . You want to yawn . After 30 years you want to yawn . Maybe he is guilty . Maybe he is not . How will we ever know ? By a Coram Nobis ? It is one of those things that will go on ad infinitum , and for that reason I feel sorry for Alger Hiss , because he is a driven man and there can never be an end . He will tell you It does n't really consume him . " It is n't the only thing in my life , " he said . " It 's certainly been a preoccupation , but I 've tried to live in the present , not the past . " I 'VE LIVED A RICH life . I do n't feel sorry for myself for what I 've missed . My manriage did founder , and that was a grievous loss , but I lost no friends because of the case . And , as you probably know , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can prac.tice law . again . " But he is n't practicing law . He is thinking about his case . The Alger Hiss case . It is his life , and this day , like so many other days in the year , he was on a college campus lecturing to help finance the legal proceedings he is continually filing . Today it was Northwestern . The subject of one lecture was " McCarthyism . " The subject of another was " Yalta . " And why not ? lie is a walking history book . He was there , for ail of It . But after the lectures , It always comes down to one thing . His case . At first the students are reticent , shy . But they need n't be . He loves to talk about it . IT IS LATE afternoon . Alger Hiss Is sitting on the highly polished brown wood of a booth in Lowden Hall , the student lounge of th . ) Northwestern University Law School . A pile of cookies lies on a napkin next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sips coffee , while the students , fresh from his lecture on " Yalta , " pepper him with questions about Truman and Roosevelt and Pottsdam . And then suddenly he is being brought to a rust-colored couch in the center of
