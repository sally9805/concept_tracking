Is man an instinctive killer , fated by his genes to be cruel and aggressive ? Or is he a product of his environment who , with proper conditioning , would be gentle , peaceful and loving ? Perhaps the most notable advocate of the " instinctivist " theory is Konrad Lorenz ( On Aggression ) , co-winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Lorenz found instinctive aggression in animals and suggested that man is similarly programmed by evolution . Behaviorist B.F. Skinner , conversely , has long argued that man can be conditioned to forsake his violent ways . Now Erich Fromm , 73 , social philosopher , psychoanalyst and bestselling author ( The Sane Society , The Art of Loving ) , has written a new book , The Anatomy of Human Destruction ( Holt , Rinehart &; Winston ; $10.95 ) , that challenges both schools of thought . <P> Lorenz is a fine observer of animals , Fromm concedes , who unfortunately " decided to venture out into a field in which he had little experience or competence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively to protect their vital interests - Fromm calls this " benign " aggression-but " only man seems to take pleasure in destroying life without any reason or purpose other than that of destroying . " It is this " malignant " aggression that Lorenz has failed to identify and that now threatens man 's very survival . <P> Manipulated Man . Fromm cites evidence to show that man 's " malignant " lust for blood is not instinctive . He argues that " cooperation and sharing was a practical necessity for most hunting societies , " and that historically , " warlikeness grows in proportion to civilization . " <P> Yet Fromm does not agree with B.F. Skinner 's plans for altering man through altering society . " Skinner , " he writes , " recommends the hell of the isolated , manipulated man of the cybernetic age as the heaven of progress . " According to Fromm , reinforcing peaceful behavior is not enough unless the reinforcers take into account Freud 's discovery that the forces driving man are often unconscious . In spite of the emphasis he puts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important determinant of a man 's character is society . Echoing arguments he has sprinkled throughout a score of earlier books , Fromm cites Mesopotamia 's urban revolution in the third millennium B.C. as being the fall from Eden . At that point simple rural egalitarian society began giving way to cities , authoritarian rule and organized industrial and military power . Alienated from his work and no longer free , man needed new ways to express his humanity , to demonstrate that he could still affect the world around him . Thus warps of character appeared : sadism , the passion to control others , and necrophilia , the attraction to death and destruction . That sadism and necrophilia still are character traits in the 20th century , Fromm demonstrates through chilling psychobiographies of Sadists Stalin and Himmler , and the necrophilous Adolf Hitler .
