For a young , untested outfielder , it is hard to imagine a bleaker prospect than trying to break into the majors with the Oakland A 's . Where can he play ? Superstar Reggie Jackson owns right , fleet Bill North roams center like a gazelle , and modest Joe Rudi is known as the best leftfielder in baseball . Most teen-age players would cast a glance at that outfield and sign up with another club or resign themselves to ten years in the minors . Not Claudell Washington . He had an A 's contract at age 17 , starred in the World Series last year at 20 , and this season has taken over leftfield and was chosen to be a member of the American League squad in this week 's All-Star game in Milwaukee . <P> Washington 's bat forced the A 's to switch Rudi to first base . As a rookie last season , Claudell hit a solid .285 . During the World Series against the Dodgers , he rocketed to .571 . As of last week he was leading the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his 47 RBls left him only four behind Team Leader Jackson , who says , " Claudell is just the best young ballplayer I 've ever seen come into the league . " The owner of the A 's , Charlie Finley , is quick to agree . During a game in Chicago , after Washington singled to drive in a run , stole second and scored on a wild pitch , Finley walked into the press box to announce he was giving Washington a $10,000 raise . <P> A muscular 6 ft. , 190 Ibs. , Washington whips his 34-oz. bat across the plate with a fluid , level swing , rifling his line drives in all directions . He has startling speed ( 32 stolen bases so far this year ) . <P> Remarkably , Washington can do all this although a doctor told him in spring training that he has an irregular heartbeat . Washington suffers occasional fainting spells ; last week he passed out twice at home and then underwent some medical tests , the results of which were still unknown . <P> There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew I was good the first time I picked up a bat . " That was when he was eleven , but Washington did not flip for baseball at the tune . In fact , he shunned it all the way through Berkeley High School in Berkeley , Calif. , where his real passion was basketball . ( Small by basketball standards , Washington leaps so high that he has tune to dunk two balls on the same jump . ) During the summers he played baseball on a city team , and it was there in 1972 that A 's Scout Jim Guinn signed him . Guinn , who had spotted Washington playing at age 13 , had no competition , since nobody else even knew about the boy . Washington graduated in two years from Birmingham <P> to the A 's . <P> For Washington , playing for Oakland has not been easy . His fielding was erratic and his throwing weak at first , and Joe Rudi did not like the idea of switching to first base . Shy and slightly awed by his teammates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he partakes of some team high jinks and even teases North and Jackson occasionally . <P> He has no doubt about where he is headed . Surveying Jackson 's lavish Berkeley Hills condominium overlooking San Francisco , Washington says : " One day I 'm going to have all this-and more . " <P> For starters , he is going to use his hefty salary increase to help buy his housekeeper mother a new home .
