The right to strike is a fundamental precept of U.S. democracy . Still , major league baseball players scarcely seem to fit into the same category as coal miners , auto workers or even schoolteachers . But last week , the National and American League teams voted unanimously to call a strike against their owners . <P> At issue was the players ' demand for greater pensions . Under the last contract , signed in 1969 , they get basically $60 a month for each year of service in the major leagues , paid beginning at age 50 . Players average about 41 years in the majors ; the pension , however , is paid only to players with at least four years ' service . Now the players want a 17% rise in pension benefits to cover cost of living increases . <P> What is really at stake is not so much money as ego and the traditional order of things . The owners are used to having their own way and the hired help has only lately begun to test its muscle at collective bargaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may possibly be settled before the first ball is due to be tossed out this week .
