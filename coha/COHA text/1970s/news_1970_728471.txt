txt Arden 0 . Lea performs brain surgery on mosquitoes . His work could help other scientists find new techniques for controling the pesky insects . The operation , conducted under a custom-built microscope with instruments fashioned I from jeweler 's tools , lasts only five minutes . Lea 's " patients " are up and flying almost as soon as the anesthetic wears off . Studies Hormone Function Lea , an entomologist at the University of Georgia , is studying the hormone function and reproductive system of the female salt marsh mosquito . He explains that present trends in insect control are toward preventing reproduction . He says his efforts to understand the mosquito 's endocrine system could prove significant to other scientists . Lea 's surgical technique involves placing female mosquitoes under an anesthetic and imbedding them in modeling clay . They then are submerged in a salt solution to keep their brain tissue from drying out . The operation is performed ' under the powerful microscope , Removes Certain Cells Leo removes certain cells , called neurosecretory cells , from the mosquito 's brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , he has discovered that female mosquitoes will not lay eggs . When they are replaced , the female mosquito , after consuming " a blood meal , " again will lay its customary batch of 100 to 200 eggs . " Only female mosquitoes bite , " Lea says . " Research here has indicated the reason is that they require a blood meal to activate the mechanisms regulating egg matura- , tion . They do n't know why they 're biting , but they are programmed by nature to seek the blood meal . "
