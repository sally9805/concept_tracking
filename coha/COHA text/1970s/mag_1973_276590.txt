LEO AND THEODORE by DONALD NEWLOVE 341 pages . Saturday Review Press . <P> $7.95 . <P> <P> For all its lilting wordplay , the vitality of its episodes , the accessibility of its meaning , sentiments and broad comedy , Donald Newlove 's second novel can be quite demanding . After finishing the last page , the reader may feel bound to answer a difficult question : Would he pick up hitchhiking 30-year-old Siamese twins , drenched and not too sober , carrying a trumpet , a trombone , a suitcase , a bag containing laundry and a bust of Ludwig van Beethoven ? <P> Do not laugh-or at least do not laugh in the wrong places . For there is much in Leo and Theodore that can get the sludge moving down at the " heart-works " ( Mr. Newlove 's word ) . There is the thematic opening passage , an evocation of ideal father-and-son solidarity expressed in a brief description of a family sturgeon hunt on Lake Erie . And some 25 years later there is that final highway scene in which the Siamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that some sympathetic motorist will help them move bodies and soul out of that upper New York State region where they have overstayed their childhoods . <P> Born on the day the stock market crashed in 1929 , Leo and Teddy are joined forever at the hip by a tough , flexible band of flesh . Their father Durwood is an odd-job country dreamer ; their mother Stella is a former hat-check girl . The twins hop about town with the nimbleness of a randy goat . The local moviehouse and pub are their real academies ; indeed a case can be made that much of the novel is a celebration of the drinking life . <P> Freaks , failures but preposterously optimistic , Leo and Teddy grow to manhood trying to be like everyone else . If their early years suggest the Katzenjammer Kids , their later years are X-rated Laurel and Hardy . They booze , dream of becoming professional jazz musicians , chase and frequently catch girls . There are Leo days , Teddy days , and occasionally Leo-and-Teddy days , never thought it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , " says one young virgin . <P> Newlove , author of a highly appreciated first novel , The Painter Gabriel ( echoes of Joyce Gary 's The Horse 's Mouth in New York 's East Village ) , uses a light , syncopated style to move his twins quickly through the years and a series of jobs : countermen , attendants to a decaying old industrialist , driver of a brakeless ambulance . It must be inferred that Leo is the one on the left , since he does the driving . <P> But it is Teddy who gets the saddest and truest line . " We spend all our time trying to keep cheerful , " he confesses during a break in the antics . Holding their freakish reality at bay is , nevertheless , a full-time job that draws heavily on the twins ' seemingly endless store of hope . Perhaps its source may be found somewhere in that laundry bag , humming in D minor , under the bust of Beethoven . " R.Z. Sheppard            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
