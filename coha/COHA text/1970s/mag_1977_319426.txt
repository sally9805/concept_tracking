Seated in the comfortable parlor of his home in Plains , President-elect Jimmy Carter was interviewed last week by TIME Chief of Correspondents Murray Gart , Washington Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey and Correspondents Stanley Cloud and Bonnie Angela . Speaking at length of his plans for the presidency and his progress thus far , Carter disclosed that he : <P> &gt; Expects to meet with Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev some time before September ; <P> &gt;Has already had exchanges with him over Strategic Arms Limitation ; <P> &gt; Hopes to maintain a personal relationship with the Chinese leadership ; <P> &gt; Plans to reorganize the leadership of the FBI ; <P> &gt; Will consider a federal job freeze ; <P> &gt; Will make extensive use of Wife Rosalynn as a sort of roving ambassador , and may open some Cabinet meetings to the press . <P> Excerpts from the interview : <P> Q. Has your view of the presidency changed from the view you had as a candidate ? <P> A. I think the overall thing is that I 've learned a lot about the Government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign affairs and defense matters , and the coordination among Cabinet officers , rather than the details that have sometimes preoccupied previous Presidents . <P> <P> Q. How about the presidency itself ? The pressures of the job ? <P> A. As far as the prospect of actually being President , I look forward to that with anticipation , with a growing sense of confidence , because I know I have a good team to work with me and the good will of the American people . I think almost all of them want me to succeed . <P> <P> Q. Have you had any second thoughts about your desire to conduct an " open " presidency ? <P> A. No , I 've not changed my mind about that . In whatever way I can be open , I 'll do it-with frequent press conferences , fireside chats to explain complicated issues , perhaps with town-hall-type forums around the country , where I answer questions from the public . I think , on occasion , I might very well have Cabinet meetings open for a limited number of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady stream of visitors-just average Americans whom we 've met during the campaign from around the country-to come in and spend a night with us at the White House and eat supper with us , so that we could have that interrelationship . <P> <P> Q. In your dealings with Congress , might you establish a procedure somewhat similar to the question period in the British Parliament , in which a Cabinet officer-or even you yourself-would go before Congess to answer questions ? <P> A. Yes , I would like to see this done-to have Cabinet officers go there . I would reserve judgment on whether I should go myself . But it 's a possibility . <P> <P> Q. What about a role for your wife Rosalynn in the Administration ? <P> A. She 's already announced that she 's going to help organize a commission on mental health . She would certainly be interested in the comprehensive health care program . I 'll let her decide what sort of projects she wants to become involved in . But she and other members of my family will probably travel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . I 'll use her as an extension of myself . <P> <P> Q. How large a role will your Vice President play ?
