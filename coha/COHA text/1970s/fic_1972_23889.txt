Translated from the Russian by Michael Glenny URING THE REIGN of Alexander III , the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich was in disfavor , and was not included in the Tsar 's entourage . Under Nicholas II he was given preferment over the swarm of other grand dukes , among whom he stood out head and shoulders , both physically and intellectually . Yet his position was not secure . At times he exerted a strong influence on the Tsar and bent him to his will . It was said , for instance , that it was the t Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich who , by threatening to shoot himself in the Tsar 's study , had forced Nicholas II to issue the constitutional manifesto of October 17 , 1905 , and to convoke the Duma . The Grand Duke was in touch with public opinion ; he did not turn away in fear from the demands of the various political parties , but listened to them . There were occasions , in his hopeless behindthe-scenes struggle against the Empress , when he lost appointments , influence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council of State Defense in 1908 was motivated by sheer jealousy , the aim being to deprive the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of his chairmanship of the Council , a move which also had the effect of putting a stop to all the work of reforming the Russian army which he and General Palitsyn had inaugurated after the Russo-Japanese War . Since then Nikolai Nikolaevich had been excluded from all participation in strategic planning and in the general formulation of army policy , merely retaining the rank of general and the post of Commander of the St. Petersburg Military District . As the likelihood of war grew , the Emperor was persuaded that only he himself had the right and the ability to command the Russian army ; consequently , in his own peculiar , arbitrary , and , to a trained military mind , incomprehensible fashion , he set about choosing his close advisers and subordinates . As chief of staff to the Commander-in:lief he appointed Yanushkevich , well known as an office-bound pen-pusher . He was , in fact , a professor at the General Staff Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well versed in the organization , logistics , and accounting procedures of the army , but had not the faintest conception of the command of troops in the field . This lack might have been made up by the appointment of a strong , competent quartermaster general , but in- stead the Tsar selected for the post the plodding , slow-wined , and narrow-minded General Danilov . When war came , however , the Emperor , either through failure of nerve or on constitutional grounds or from awareness of the public mood , changed his mind . Despite his previOus decision , and against court opposition , he appointed the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Commanderin-Chief . And in his usual charming , unbusinesslike manner , he asked the Grand Duke , as a personal favor , not to change the staff of General Headquarters but to leave his appointees in their posts . Nikolai Nikolaevich had always regarded the will of the Lord 's Anointed as sacred . He had been brought up to regard his nephew as his ruler ; otherwise the monarchical principle was meaningless . Previously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vich had intended to make a clean sweep of headquarters and staff it with efficient and deserving men ; he had enjoyed the thought of how he would astonish Russia and shock the court by appointing General Palitsyn as chief of staff , and as quartermaster general the modest , unassuming General Alexeyev , a man with an amazingly clear military mind , whose talents the Grand Duke had been the first to discover at a conference held to discuss the annual maneuvers . Obliged to accede to the Tsar 's request , he had to start work with a headquarters staff made up of incompetent men who had been wished upon him and who were more of a hindrance than a help ; he also had to accept a war plan which he had not drawn up , which was at odds with his own thinking , and which , indeed , he knew nothing of when he took over his appointment . He was , however , surprised , delighted , and encouraged by a divine omen . On arrival at General Headquarters at Baranovichi , the Grand Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command would be a fortunate one and that Russia would therefore be victorious . This was vouchsafed to him through an extraordinary , almost impossible and therefore mystical coincidence . In the small town of Baranovichi ( which was little more than a railway junction , and to which General Headquarters had been transferred from St. Petersburg ) , the church turned out to be dedicated to St. Nicholas . Not St. Nicholas of Myra , whose shrines were to be found all over Holy Russia  --  that would have been quite unremarkable  --  bur the Blessed Nikolai Kochan , a fool-in-Christ and miracle-worker from Novgorod , whose feast day was July 27 ( almost the day of their arrival at Baranovichi ) . This was the Commander-in-Chiefs own name day , and the Blessed Nicholas was , therefore , his patron saint . There were practically no other churches dedicated to him in the whole of Russia . This coincidence could not be mere chance ; it was a mystic sign . In order to have time to meditate upon the full , true significance of this heavenly portent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this place of good omen . Rather than spend his time among the regiments and divisions in the front lines , he should remain at Baranovichi , where all the railway lines intersected ; it was here that fate intended him to bring about a Russian victory ! The decision to keep General Headquarters permanently at one site resulted in a steady , comfortable routine in which duty and leisure alternated in measured sequence . The two trains comprising General Headquarters were drawn up at the edge of a forest ; the Commander-in-Chiefs personal train was stationed almost in the middle of it . The quartermaster general 's department , where all operational and strategic matters were dealt with , was billeted in a little house chosen because it was a mere twenty paces from the coach that had the Grand Duke 's sleeping quarters . If any messages or other news arrived at night , the Commander-inChief was not disturbed ; only after he had risen at nine o'clock in the morning , had washed and said his prayers , were messages brought for him to study over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his report . Two hours were spent in discussing operational matters , followed by lunch at noon . The Grand Duke then lay down to rest- , and afterward went for a drive in his car ( never faster than fifteen miles an hour , for fear of accidents ) . It was by then time for afternoon tea , after which there were no further serious duties , the rest of the day being taken up with minor matters such as the affairs of his personal suite , or with private talks . Before dinner the Grand Duke would sit down in his coach to write his daily letter to his wife in Kiev , in which he gave a minute account of the events of the day . He found life impossible without mental communion with his beloved wife : this was one thing which he would have to forgo if he were to spend time visiting the front-line units ; as it was , the permanence of his location at General Headquarters enabled the Commander-in-Chief to receive his wife 's letters with absolute regularity . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner for all officers of the staff was served in the dining car , always with vodka andwine ; later there was tea again , although attendance at this was not obligatory . Daily at vespers and at the liturgy on feast days , the Commander-in-Chief attended his own church , the choir of which consisted of especially chosen singers from the court chapel in St. Petersburg and the Kazan Cathedral . When alone , the Grand Duke always felt himself to be in the presence of God ; he never sat down to a meal without saying grace , and every night he would pray for a long time on his knees , bowing his forehead to the ground , completely absorbed in his prayers , convinced they were of the greatest practical help . H OWEVER , NO VICTORIES CAME . Even on the Austrian front , things were not going well , while in East Prussia the battle of Gumbinnen was not followed by a second , culminating success : the Russian armies were not pushing the enemy either into the sea or across the Vistula . Samsonov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The next news was of Artamonov 's dismissal ; in the Grand Duke 's opinion , this had been done much too hastily  --  removing one 's corps commanders in that fashion was no way to fight a war . Then came general silence . On the sixteenth Zhilinsky arrived in Baranovichi , complaining that Samsonov had arbitrarily broken off communications and was now completely out of touch . Colonel Vorotyntsev , who had been sent to Second Army , had for some reason not yet returned This prolonged lack of information was most unsettling All day long on the seventeenth there was still no news . Oe the night of the eighteenth the Grand Duke was awakeneC on receipt of a strange , dubious , and alarming telegram : although enciphered in the correct military code , it had beer sent by the normal civilian telegraph service , bypassing Army Group Headquarters , and read : " After five-day bank region **34;2115;TOOLONG greater pan Second Army destroyed . Army commander shot himself Remnants of army fleeing across Russian frontier . " It wa : signed only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been signed by a more senior officer ? Why not la ) the chief of staff ? What was the answer to this mystery ? Wa : it a mistake made under stress by some nervous officer ? Wh ) had nothing been heard from Zhilinsky and Oranovsky a Northwestern Army Group Headquarters , who should bi able to provide more information ? Yet the only communication received from Zhilinsk ) and Oranovsky throughout August 18 was a statement at tributing all blame to Samsonov , and an account , whirl read like a boy 's adventure story , of how the headquarter staff of Second Army had escaped encirclement . The repor ended : " No information to hand concerning the position o the corps of Second Army . One may assume that I Corps i still engaged around Neidenburg .. . Large numbers o stragglers from XV Corps are arriving in Ostrolenka . " This was too little to clarify the situation , but enough ti cause disquiet . Nevertheless , Danilov and Yanushkevich were still try ing to persuade the Grand Duke that the situation did no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tun out favorably . All the same , the Commander-in-Chief fel a twinge of unease : if nothing more precise than Zhilinsky ' vague assumption was known about 1 Corps , which wa relatively close and accessible , then what of those corps which were farther away ? He sensed the onset of a catastrophe in which human forces were powerless to intervene and only heaven itself could save them . He went to vespers as usual and lacer in his private compartment on the train he remained alone for a long time , praying on his narrow , bony knees in front of the lighted icon lamps , a tall figure even in this posture . So far , there was still no formal , written report from Zhilinsky on the rout of Second Army , and consequently the Grand Duke was not justified in submitting a similar official report to the Tsar . However , for the next few days he went through his routine dully and mechanically : tall and stately as a poplar , stiffly erect , shoulders squared , he strode about the site of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been laid out alongside the railway track . The keen , soldierly expression which made him look so much younger than his age had vanished from his face ; he was now patently almost an old man . With his usual reserved courtesy he chatted with members of his personal suite and with officers of the staff , although , according to the tacit rules of security observed at headquarters , operational matters were never discussed anywhere except in the building occupied by the quartermaster general 's staff . It was particularly important to conceal the news from the representatives of the Allies  --  the Frenchman , the Englishman , the Belgian , the Serb , and the Montenegrin  --  who were living in the same train and always dined with the Russian officers ; there was no need for them to know the bad news until it had to be publicly admitted . And although the disquieting rumors passed to and fro in whispers and faces began to look grim , they all followed the Grand Duke 's example , and life at General Headquarters outwardly maintained its unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guards , the Grand Duke 's aide-de-camp , still walked up and down between the Grand Duke 's coach and the quartermaster general 's house giving his piercing whistle to summon and dispatch his carrier pigeons , and continued to train his pet badger . By the nineteenth , however , the time had come not only to report the catastrophe to the Tsar but to release a statement to the newspapers , for rumors were filtering through to the press . The Grand Duke took refuge in uncommunicative gloom ; he could not predict how the Tsar , who was notoriously fickle in his attitude toward his favorites , would react to the news . His reply to reports never came quickly , so they would have to wait for two or three days . Of course the Empress , together with the Rasputin party at court and Sukhomlinov , would inevitably try to use the defeat in East Prussia as a weapon against the Grand Duke , and they might even succeed in having him dismissed without being given a chance to justify himself . Seen from Petersburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank to nothing ; they would have little difficulty in convincing the Tsar that the whole affair was the fault of the Commander-in-Chief . But even more oppressive than waiting for the monarch 's reply was the Grand Duke 's nagging awareness of his own ignorance of the events for which he expected to be punished . What had happened ? How had it happened ? What was the extent of the disaster ? It was all still confused or Harvey Dinnerstein unknown . Zhilinsky had powerful connections at court , and the Grand Duke was not in a position simply to order him to give a rapid and comprehensive account of what had happened as he would have done with any other subordinate . It might be that he knew the answers but was concealing them , while the Commander-in-Chief bore the ultimate responsibility . N THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH , General Headquarters again demanded a detailed report from Northwestern Army Group Headquarters , but Oranovsky replied that he too was still unable to obtain enough information for a comprehensive statement . Until then , although the nights had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . On the morning of the twentieth , however , the sun had nor shone in its full splendor , the weather had been overcast since dawn , and the sky had grown imperceptibly hazier hour by hour , There were no clouds and only a very light wind , but it was chilly . Then a gray mist had arisen in the west and by noon the whole sky was lowering and gray , Although heavyhearted , the Grand Duke did his best to keep to the usual routine . At the appointed time he came out of his coach dressed for his daily airing , which today was to be on horseback . Then he saw the Chief of Army Communications , a ponderous , slow-moving , but kindhearted man who collected cigar labels . The Commander-in-Chief remembered that he had some labels from a new brand of cigars , told his colleague to wait , and went back into his coach to get them . As he came out of the coach , he saw coming toward him , striding out of the forest , none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Vororyntsev , alive and well ? Here was the man he needed more than anyone else . Vorotyntsev was walking swiftly , glancing around as though trying to overtake someone so as to be the first to arrive . But there was no one else apart from the Chief of Communications ( delighted with his cigar labels ) , an aide-de-camp and the liaison general , who was standing a little farther away . Vorotyntscv was wearing no greatcoat , only his tunic , as though he had been at headquarters all the time . Although his was the unmistakable stride of a regimental officer , it betrayed a slight stiffness which almost amounted to a limp . One of his shoulders was noticeably higher than the other , there was a scab of clotted blood on his jaw , and his cheeks were unevenly shaven . " Vorotyntsev ! " the Grand Duke was the first to exclaim with pleasure before the colonel had time to approach and make his report . " You 're back ! Why has n't anyone told me ? " Vorotyntsev saluted with rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of the same stiffness that was in his gait , as though his arm was heavier than usual . " Your Highness ! I 've only just arrived  --  about ten minutes ago ... " ( He had not " only just " arrived but had been lurking in the forest for several hours , where he had left Blagodaryov with his greatcoat and knapsack . Knowing how things worked ar headquarters , he had purposely arranged this direct meeting with the Grand Duke , so as to avoid seeing Yanushkevich and Danilov . ) " Are you wounded ? " With , a rapid , expressive movement of his eyebrows , the Commander-in-Chief indicated that he had guessed at Vorotyntsev 's bandaged shoulder under his runic . " Oh , it 's nothing . " With urgent entreaty in his eyes he stared at the Grand Duke . The latter 's strong , angular features had at once taken on a more youthful look , although the change was provoked by a sense of alarm . " Well , " he said , " what 's been happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly to attention in the regulation manner required when reporting to a senior officer , but his eyes were watching the aide-de-camp and the general , who was approaching from the opposite direction . if only he could gain the Grand Duke 's attention before all these others bore down on him ! " Your Highness , I request your permission to be heard in confidence . " " Yes , of course . " The Grand Duke gave a decisive nod and with a characteristically abrupt movement he turned sharplyon his heel . His long , thin , booted legs were already mounting the steps of his railway coach as he ordered his aide-de-camp not ro admit anyone . The interior of the coach had been converted into a study . Carpeted from wall to wall , it contained a desk , a large icon of Christ , and a portrait of the Tsar ; a presentation sword , crossed with its scabbard , hung on the wall . The Supreme Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces of mighty Russia  --  serious , intelligent , and accessible to rational argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisturbed by advisers , eager to hear the news which Vorotyntsev alone could give him . In all Vorotyntsev 's military career he had never been in such a situation before  --  and never would be again . It was a unique , unrepeatable encounter : a chance for a clear-thinking combatant officer to exert a direct influence on the functioning of the entire military machine . All his previous service had been a prelude to this culminating moment : his thoughts were ordered and purposeful , his mind keyed up to full pitch . He had slept like a log for almost two nights and a day , and although his body still ached and throbbed , his head was clear . The fortunate start to the interview increased his mental alertness . He began his account , talking with ease and fluency ; never overawed in any company , he was unaffected by the august presence of the Grand Duke . In crisp , summary terms he described the inadequacy of the preparations for Second Army 's advance ; how it had been forced ahead too hard and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how it had actually gone ; how the Germans had reacted ; how many major opportunities had been lost and what had occurred as a result . Throughout the period of Second Army 's encirclement by the Germans , and afterward among the survivors , Vorotyntsev had asked questions and collected data whenever possible , and all this information now helped him to reinterpret the clear mental picture of the battlefront with which he had so boldly strode into Samsonov 's headquarters only nine days ago . But more than that , he brought with him into the Commander-in-Chief 's private quarters the scorching breath of battle which he had inhaled during the ebb and flow of the fighting around Usdau and in the hopeless attempts to defend Neidenburg with a few companies of the Estland Regiment . He brought with him , too , that passionate sense of conviction which inspires belief less by its veracity than by its origin in personal suffering . He spoke with the special insight of one who had witnessed Yaroslav Kharitonov 's boyish delight when , on discovering that the troops ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean ... you have n't been surrounded ? And the people behind you are Russians too , not Germans ? " Graven equally on his memory were the words of Arseny Blagodaryov as he gave a sigh of relief like a blast from a blacksmith 's bellows : " Is that Russia ahead of us ? Whew , thank God  --  we thought we 'd never drag ourselves that far ... " Then , collapsing like an empty sack , he had rammed his now unnecessary butcher 's knife into the ground . Everything which the Commander-in-Chief , unable to see or imagine the reality , had summoned into motion from a great distance was now being brought back by Vorotyntsev and dumped in the middle of his desk . As far as he knew it , the colonel undertook to describe the fate of each battalion of almost every regiment  --  which ones had been destroyed while fighting rear-guard actions , which ones had escaped . The artillery had been completely wiped out and no less than seventy thousand men had been caught in the ring of encirclement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ten and fifteen thousand had managed to get away , without the benefit of leadership from their generals . Did n't the Commander-in-Chief know any of this already ? Had Northwestern Army Group Headquarters told him nothing ? The Commander-in-Chiefs long , thin , well-bred features had taken on the intent look of a hunter . He hardly interrupted or asked questions ( Vorotyntsev 's account was in any case fluent and articulate ) , only occasionally picking up his fountain pen with a mechanical gesture , but not taking notes . He chewed on his cigar and smoked it furiously , as though its very length was keeping him from reaching the truth . To say that he sympathized with the men of Samsonov 's army was an understatement : he was absorbed in the story , was himself transformed into one of the unfortunate participants in that disastrous battle . The hope grew in Vorotyntsev that he had not plunged in vain into that hellfire , had not wasted his time there as a mere onlooker , and that he would soon justify himself by causing the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against all those blockheaded fools . Vorotyntsev had never been guilty of overmuch respect for his superiors in rank , and now less so than ever . He discussed corps commanders as though they were inefficient platoon leaders whom he himself could dismiss . Suddenly , while talking about Artamonov , who more than any other commander had aroused his anger , he sensed a cooling of the Commander-in-Chief 's attitude and a hostility in his glance . For all the dissimilarity between the two men , he could not help being reminded of the look of blank impenetrability which he had seen in the eyes of Artamonov . The Grand Duke agreed that the story about the fatal order was incomprehensible ; but it might , of course , have been due to a mistake made by a junior officer . It was a weakness of the Grand Duke 's that he tended to accept and overlook the failings of his subordinates . Unlike the Tsar , who , while smiling his habitual shy smile , was quite capable of casting his favorite of yesterday into outer darkness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would always defend anyone whom he had once liked . Even if the man were an incompetent clown ... As a way of testing the Grand Duke 's reactions , Vorotyntsev listed the names of the brave regiments that had been annihilated at Usdau by Artamonov 's act of criminal deception , taking care ro mention the Yenisei Regiment at whose head the Grand Duke himself had so recently led the ceremonial parade at Peterhof . At this , the Commander-in-Chief said : " Of course , there will be the most rigorous inquiry . But he is a brave general and a deeply religious man . " At this moment his interest in Vorotyntsev 's story , all his sympathetic attention , seemed to undergo an eclipse by a vaporous cloud of grand-ducal solemnity . Vorotyntsev fell silent . If the order to retreat from Usdau was not absolute folly , if it was not a crime to pull back troops who after hours of bombardment had spontaneous ! ) gone over to the attack , if the decision to cause a thoroughly battle-worthy corps to withdraw twenty-five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if all this was not good reason to call Artamonov to account and tear the general 's epaulettes from his shoulders  --  what then was the point of mobilizing an army at all ? What was the point of declaring war ? Why , the Grand Duke 's very coach should have reared up in horror at Vorotyntsev 's account ! The whole train ought to have shuddered and jumped the rails ! But it stayed unshaken and the remains of some tea , cooling in a glass , did not so much as tremble . The Commander-in-Chief 's strong right hand was not going to be raised in punishment and redress , and Vorotyntsev 's superhuman efforts had been made in vain . He had accumulated all the initial impetus needed to move a vast mass , he had been utterly convinced that he was about to jolt it into motion  --  yet , after all , the mass had proved smoothly resistant , and his outstretched arms had slithered ineffectually off its rounded surface . He had attempted to move the immovable . His strength had not failed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked long and hard . Now he was spent ; he needed to rest and draw breath . The Commander-in-Chief , too , sat there like a beaten man , shoulders slumped , his martial bearing gone . " I thank you , Colonel . What you have said will not be forgotten . General Zhilinsky arrives here tomorrow , and we will arrange a conference in the Operations Section . You will attend and make your report . " Hope revived in Vorotyntsev as he stared across the desk at the sad , thin old man with the long , horselike face . Perhaps tomorrow the whole affair might be brought into the open ; perhaps the right steps would be taken after all . In fact , Artamonov was not important ; what was important was that the appropriate lessons should be learned . The Grand Duke made a gesture indicating that the audience was over . Vorotyntsev stood up and requested permission to go . Only now did he realize that he had been sitting there for two hours . Nikolai Nikolaevich 's strong mouth was twisted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report had not been entirely useless , There was a knock at the door , and Derfelden , an aide-de-camp , hurried in with a sealed telegram . Leaning forward respectfully , the tall Horse Guard announced as he handed it over : " From His Majesty ! " He turned on his heel and starred to leave . The Commander-in-Chief rose and read the telegram standing . Vorotyntsev 's mind was still in such a whirl that he failed to realize that he had no right to be present during the reading of a telegram from the Tsar . He had a confused impression that something still remained to be said . By the fading daylight ( the weather outside was becoming more and more dull and overcast ) he saw the noble features of the Grand Duke lighten , grow calmer and younger . The crooked line of grief which Vorotyntsev 's story had just chiseled around his mouth smoothed out and vanished . The Commander-in-Chief stretched out his long arm after the retiring Derfelden . " Captain ! Ask the archpriest to come and see me  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his erect dignity of bearing had returned to the resilient , wiry old man . He took up a majestic stance in front of the portrait of his sovereign , ruler of all Russia by the mandate of Heaven . Vorotyntsev stood half a head shorter than the Grand Duke . Once again he saluted and asked leave to go , but the Commander-in-Chief replied solemnly : " No , Colonel . Since you are here , and since you have not shirked your duty in telling me your unhappy story , you have earned the right to be the first to hear our consolation for it . Listen to the comfort His Majesty offers us , hear how graciously he has responded to the report of the catastrophe ! " And he read out the telegram in a clear voice , savoring every word of the text more than if he had composed it himself : " ' Dear Uncle Nick , I grieve deeply with you over the loss of our gallant Russian soldiers . But we must submit to the will of God . He who endures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' He who endures to the end ... shall be saved ! ' " Entranced , the handsome , erect old campaigner repeated the phrase in a reverent tone as though reporting to some invisible senior officer . Relishing the old-fashioned , biblicalwords , he seemed to find new meaning in their repetition . There was a knock and the archpriest entered , a man with a thin , gentle , intelligent face . " Listen , Father Georgii ! Hear how kind His Majesty has been to us , what joy he sends us ! ' Dear Uncle Nick , I grieve deeply with you over the loss of our gallant Russian soldiers . But we must submit to the will of God . He who endures to the end shall be saved . Yours , Nicky . ' " Composing his features into a suitable expression , the archpriest crossed himself toward the icon . " And there is another message as well , " the Grand Duke went on . " The Tsar informs us that he has ordered the icon ' The Blessed Virgin Appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispatched immediately to General Headquarters from the Monastery of the Trinity and St. Sergius . What a joy this is ! " " That is splendid news , Your Highness ! " said the archpriest , stressing his remark with a dignified bow . " This exceptional icon was painted on a piece of wood from the coffin of Father Sergius himself . For three centuries it has accompanied our armies into battle . It was with Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich on his Lithuanian campaign ; it was with Peter the Great at the battle of Poltava , and with Tsar Alexander the Blessed on his European campaign . It was also . . . at the Commander-in-Chief 's headquarters in the war against Japan . " " This is wonderful ! It is a sign of God 's grace ! " The Grand Duke strode excitedly across the floor , covering the distance in two of his long strides . " This icon will bring us the aid of the Mother of God ! " ? t ? PRAYING KNEADS NO DOUGH ? * ?

Around them stood the tall , bare pine trees , only their tops moving slightly in the wind . " No ! " Vorotyntsev shook his head . The two days he had spent at General Headquarters had not succeeded in calming his feelings . " To speak out once and for all and say what one really thinks  --  it 's more than a pleasure , its a sacred duty ! One ought to get it all off one 's chest and then die afterward if necessary .

No , my dear fellow , the people who get things done around here are not the rebels but the doers . They go about it discreetly and they do n't make a lot of fuss , but they get things done . For instance , if in one day I manage to alter a couple of stupid orders so that they make sense , and by doing so justify a decision made by a brave regimental commander or save a battalion of sappers from being needlessly sent to their deaths , then I reckon my day has n't been wasted .

If you get yourself kicked out of headquarters they 'll simply send in someone else worse . Why let that happen ? " Of all the officers in the Operations Section , indeed in the whole quartermaster general 's department , and , for that matter , in the entire General Headquarters , Svechin was the only man Vorotyntsev trusted , and Svechin felt the same about Vorotyntsev . But trust in parts is finally no trust , for if one is to trust , there must be no partitions . The previous evening , after his interview with the Commander-in-Chief , Vororyntsev had made his report to Yanushkevich and Danilov , but it had been an extremely superficial affair : they had made no attempt to go into detail and would have preferred no report at all . With Svechin , however , he had discussed the subject at length until late at night , and the latter had supplied him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , from early morning right up to the last minutes before the conference , they had continued to thrash out the matter . " No doubt you 're right , " Vorotyntsev replied with an obstinate grin on his emaciated but still keen and lively face . " But if you had only been through what I 've just been through ... Even your common sense and mine put together would n't ... No , I 'm sure this is a state of mind which comes to us only once or twice in a lifetime . I 'm determined to see to it that , come what may , the truth and nothing but the truth gets hammered out today . If only the Grand Duke had reacted differently yesterday ... " " You must realize that the Grand Duke is simply waiting for the arrival of the telegram announcing the capture of Lvov . They 're all waiting for that telegram , " Svechin went on insistently , unsmilingly , with irrefutable logic , his eyes glaring ferociously as he pressed the point home . " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . They 'll set the bells ringing all over Russia to celebrate our own incompetence  --  because the truth is we had the Austrian army in the grip of a pincer movement and let it go , so that when we captured L'vov it was empty . " But Vorotyntsev was incapable of grasping the significance of the Austrian front ; his mind was obsessed by the German encircling movement at Neidenburg . He replied heatedly : " You might have convinced me and I might have kept my mouth shut if this were purely a military matter . I agree that a defeat in one sector can be counterbalanced by success somewhere else . But this is n't just a military problem any longer , do n't you see ? It 's a moral issue ! To drive one 's people unprepared to slaughter is something far beyond the considerations of mere strategy . ' He who endures to the end ... ! ' Thanks to them , we are the ones who have to suffer and endure  --  to the bitter end ! And none of them even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're quite ready to endure four or five more massive defeats on this scale  --  but by then only the Lord above will be able to help them ! " " Even so , you wo n't do any good , " Svechin insisted firmly , hissing the words through clenched teeth . " Nothing would be changed and you 'd simply get a bloody nose . Russia is doomed to be governed by fools ; she knows no other way . I know what I 'm talking about . The only thing to do is keep your head down and get on with the job . " " But I ca n't sit quietly and keep my head down ! I wo n't be able to sit through this conference without getting up to say what I think . Look  --  do n't you see ? It 's like an arrow in my chest , burning and throbbing , and I 've got to pull it out . How can I settle down to work again until I 've done that ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction during the conference . " They had come back to the cluster of buildings beside the headquarters train at the edge of the forest . It was five minutes to ten , and other officers were starting to converge on the cottage that housed the quartermaster general 's department . Just then , on a path at the edge of the wood skirting the command officers ' quarters , waddling like a duck in his haste , a fussy little army clerk came toward them . He was followed by Arseny Blagodaryov striding along at one pace to the other man 's two , with his naturally straight-backed carriage which owed nothing to military training . Chest out , arms swinging freely as though he had cast all his burdens from his shoulders , Blagodaryov looked around him with an uninhibited curiosity that was quite unaffected by the exalted atmosphere of the headquarters and the proximity of any number of grand dukes . At once Vorotyntsev 's tension and irritation seemed to vanish . He held out his hand to stop the clerk . Preoccupied but quick-witted , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow fully extended ( like all the rankers at headquarters , he was well aware of the exact pecking order among all these senior officers ) , and spoke first , without waiting to be questioned : " Yes , we 're going to take a complete record of the conference , your honor ; every word will be noted down . " " H'mm , " Vorotyntsev let him go and turned affectionately toward Arseny . Blagodaryov saluted the two officers , " his " colonel and the other , his elbow well out and his head held straight , but without any hint of servility and almost as if the gesture were part of a game . " Well , Arseny , are you being posted to the artillery ? " " Seems so , " said Arseny with a condescending smile . " Built like a grenadier , is n't he ? " said Vorotyntsev to Svechin , as he clenched his fist and gave Arseny a friendly , admiring punch in the chest . " I 've arranged for you to be posted to an artillery brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " said Blagodaryov , grinning and running his tongue around the inside of his cheek . Then he pulled himself up with a jerk , remembering that this was not the way to behave here ; they were n't in the front line now . " Thank you very much indeed ! " He saluted again , his large underlip jutting out in what was almost a smile . His attitude was not an acquisition from the terrible days of the encirclement and retreat ; he had been just the same when Vorotyntsev had found him at Usdau . Even then he had the ability to strike the right note , not only with " his " colonel but with every officer . He unfailingly used the correct military expressions , one felt certain that he would never overstep the bounds of the prescribed relationship , and yet there were times when his tone implied that it was all agame . Although quite unschooled , Arseny gave the impression of knowing all there was to know about military science and a great deal more . " Supposing I 'm sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join me there ? " " Infantry ? " Arseny pushed out his lower lip . " Yes . " Blagodaryov put on an expression as though he were thinking . " No-o-o , " he drawled , " I 'd still prefer the artillery . " But then he pretended to check himself . " But of course ? anything you say , sir ! " Vorotyntsev laughed the way one laughs at children . He put both hands on Blagodaryov 's shoulders , which meant raising them well above the height of his own ; the epaulettes were no longer crumpled but had been smoothed out and stiffened with cardboard . " I 'm not going to give you any more orders , Arseny . You 're not angry with me for having taken you away from the Vyborg Regiment , are you ? And for having dragged you into the trap set by the Germans ? " " ' Course not , " Arseny replied quietly and naturally , as though to a friend from his own village . His nose twitched . While they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been no time to talk , and after that , they had both needed a good long sleep to recuperate . Now each had to go his separate way in the service , and in any case there was too much difference in their ranks for a real talk . Somehow the opportunity had passed . Vorotyntsev felt a lump in his throat and had to swallow . His squashed-potato nose still twitching slightly , Arseny ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth ; his tongue felt as if it were slightly too big . " Well , who knows . . perhaps one of these days . . . we can ... Do your duty , Arseny I expect you 'll be a colonel too one day . " They both laughed . " And make sure you go home in one piece . " " You too , sir ! " Vorotyntsev took off his cap , and Arseny snatched off his own . A cold wind blew around them , and there was a slight drizzle . They kissed on the lips , Arseny had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch up with Svechin . Blagodaryov strode on after the fussy , ill-tempered little clerk . I N THE am-AGE OCCUPIED by the quartermaster general 's department there were no large rooms ; the biggest could take just twenty people sitting closely packed . There were not , on paper , as many as twenty key senior officers in the whole of General Headquarters , but twenty were now assembled , all of them obviously men whose opinions were important . Two small tables were placed at right angles to each other . At one end was the Commander-in-Chief , the tallest man in the room even when sitting down . Beside him , inseparable as ever , was his brother the Grand Duke Pyotr Nikolaevich , wearing an expression of diligent attention ( although everyone knew that for years he had been engaged not in military affairs but in ecclesiastical architecture ) . Next to him was their cousin , Prince Peter Oldenburg ( a charming man ) . Then came His Serene Highness Adjutant General Prince Dmitry Golitsyn ( who in recent years had been in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liaison general , General Petrovo-Solovovo ( a most delightful person , the Marshal of Nobility of Ryazan Province ) ; the Commander-in-Chief 's chief of staff , Lieutenant General Yanushkevich ; the quartermaster general , Lieutenant General Danilov ; and the duty general of General Headquarters . Immediately opposite the Commander-in-Chief , with his back to the wall at the angle of the tables , sat the General Officer Commanding the Northwestern Army Group , General-of-Cavalry Zhilinsky . Next came the representative at headquarters of the Foreign Office , the representative of the Admiralty , and the Chief of Military Communications . Those for whom there was not room around the tables included several senior officers from the Operations Section , the Commander-in-Chief 's duty aide-de-camp , a Kalmuck prince who was Yanushkevich 's ADC , and Zhilinsky 's ADC ; these had to sit where they could , on chairs by the window or the stove , and , when necessary , wrote in note pads held on their knees . The stove had been lit since early morning and its hear was needed . More and more often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside it was so dull it was almost dark enough to switch on the electric light . - As there was so little room to spare for standing up , it was agreed that officers would speak sitting down . This gave the meeting the less formal and more businesslike air of an exchange of opinions rather than an affair of set speeches . At the invitation of the Grand Duke , the conference was opened by Zhilinsky . Feeling it unnecessary to look at more than a few of those present , he only half raised his gray eyebrows and looked either down at his papers or up at the Grand Duke , occasionally extending his field of vision by moving his head . As usual , he spoke with no attempt to color his words with emotion . He did not allow that anyone present might regard him as the accused . He spoke in a harsh , didactic tone , as the equal of the Commanderin-Chief who had been summoned on terms of parity to discuss an event that was unpleasant but not of major significance . The tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late General Samsonov . It had begun with Samsonov 's failure to carry our the Army Group 's initial directive concerning the main axis of advance . ( This was then described in detail . ) Arbitrarily deviating from the prescribed axis , he had inadmissibly allowed the frontage of his army to become overstretched , had made his army corps march too far and had thereby overextended the lines of communication and supply . What was worse , he had allowed a gap to open between First Army and Second Army which had hindered their mutual cooperation . Unlike the punctilious General Rennenkampf , Samsonov had furthermore taken an excessively independent attitude toward many other orders issued to him ( there followed a detailed list of what these were ) . Particularly incomprehensible to a normal mind was Samsonov 's order of August 14/15 to his center corps to continue advancing , when he already knew that both his flanking corps had veered outward from their given axes . This crass error was compounded by Samsonov 's impetuous decision to cut off telegraph communication from Neidenburg , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat of Second Army . When , after some delay , Army Group Headquarters discovered the state of affairs , it immediately telegraphed co all the corps of Second Army to retire to their starting lines , and it was entirely the fault of General Samsonov that the center corps did not receive these communications . The Army Group Commander did not raise his grating voice in the passages where he accused Samsonov ; this served to reinforce the impression of events that he was attempting to convey to the conference  --  namely , that everything was , quite simply , Samsonov 's fault  --  a view which naturally lessened the feelings of guilt and unease of all present- No one interrupted , no one whispered or even coughed . Only the flies , brought to life by the heat of the stove , buzzed about the room and settled in black clusters on the whitewashed stove chimney and the ceiling . Inwardly , Vorotyntsev writhed in agony . At this moment , there was no one in Russia , indeed in all war-torn Europe , whom he hated more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He hated his voice , his mud-colored face , his long , dyed moustaches with their ends turned up in an attempt to look impressive . But it was not merely for his performance today that he hated this gravedigger : forged link by link ever since his appointment as Chief of the General Staff , the chain of his incompetence had been hung around the neck of the Russian army and was dragging it down to destruction . Now he was deliberately exculpating himself without fear of being contradicted or that there might be any other interpretation of events , least of all that he might be called to account or dismissed from his post  --  though even if this should happen there would always be another , eminently suitable job waiting for him somewhere else . He had , after all , fulfilled his chief duty , which was to assist General Joffre and Russia 's ally France . At the very least he would be invited to Paris to accept bouquets of flowers from grateful French ladies and to lunch with the President of the Republic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Zhilinsky was not going to leave his listeners without hope . He suggested some bold plans for retrieving the situation , namely to stage an immediate repeat performance of the combined maneuver of First Army and Second Army around the Masurian Lakes ! Rennenkampf was already excellently placed to carry out this operation , having pushed deep into East Prussia , and it only remained to bring Second Army up to strength again with reinforcements , to re-form some of its army corps , and to send its new commander , General Scheidemann , into the advance on the same axis as that chosen before the outbreak of hostilities . Although Zhilinsky 's report had covered everything of importance , it was now the turn of General Danilov to speak . The occasion would not be complete without a word from the man whom everyone present regarded as the leading strategist of the Russian army . As such , it was incumbent upon him not only to speak but to utter some profound thoughts , to make it clear that behind that domed forehead his great mind was ceaselessly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was that his forehead was solid bone , his mind moved at a snail 's pace , and the thoughts which passed through it were worthless . But just because this was so , the quartermaster general launched on his speech with all the smug self-confidence of a limited , second-class intellect . He fully agreed , he declared , with all the points that the Army Group Commander had just made . ( There followed a detailed recapitulation of what they were . ) But certain important observations should he added to that account . If Samsonov had not been so far behind schedule but had crossed the German frontier on August 6 according to plan , and if he had struck a blow at the enemy 's flank in the area of the Masurian Lakes as he had been instructed , instead of waiting until the Germans had had time to wheel and make a frontal attack , then the enemy would undoubtedly have been caught off balance and we should today be celebrating a major victory . Furthermore , the disaster had been in no small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exhausted , for which General Samsonov was to blame because of his failure to give his troops their proper rest days as laid down in the Manual of Infantry Regulations . He was also guilty of many other errors of lesser importance . Even worse than what he said was the stupefying air of self-importance which the quartermaster general assumed when he finished speaking . His very face , with its timid eyes , flat , shapeless little ears , and thin , spindly moustaches so incongruous that they seemed glued on , was stamped with the blinkered dullness and inertia of some minor provincial official . Yet the airs the man gave himself ! When he stopped talking , it was as though he dared not go further because it would mean touching on some profound secret that he could not divulge because the present assembly was not selective enough . Deliberately he was creating the impression of martyrdom : he , Danilov , must guard the secret and carry on his narrow shoulders the full weight of military responsibility in all its complexity ; onerous though the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their problems for them . He alone , he implied , was the key figure in Russian strategy : officers junior to him could never be so well informed or so capable , while above him were only the active but inexperienced Yanushkevich and the Grand Duke , who , though brave and keen , was quite untrained as a strategist . Now the floor passed to the Commander-in-Chief 's chief of staff . How he wished he could miss his turn ! Dark-eyed and bushy-moustached , Yanushkevich was a small man with a puffy face , an insinuating manner , and a deep affection for paper and files . Appointed in a fortunate moment by the good-natured Tsar , the affable Yanushkevich when faced with strategic operational matters had felt as frightened and lost as Little Red Riding Hood in the dark forest . But it was flattering to occupy such an exalted post , and his delight in being offered it overcame his fears ; in any case , how could he disappoint the charming , blue-eyed Emperor , who was as shy as Yanushkevich himself , and admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever he went driving in a carriage or walked across the parquet-floored expanses of the palaces of St. Petersburg , he could not help watching himself from the wings and repeating with fearful delight : " Lieutenant-General Yanushkevich , Chief of the Russian Imperial General Staff ! " As he owed his promotion to the War Minister , he did express certain doubts to him , but Sukhomlinov brushed them aside in his usual hearty , optimistic manner : " You 'll manage , old man , you 'll manage ! " From the first day of his appointment , Yanushkevich found himself the prisoner of Danilov , who was the only man who knew anything about operational matters and whose tone of voice never failed to convey reproach that Yanushkevich rather than he had been made chief of staff . Yanushkevich , on the other hand , did at least know one thing : that there were several officers in the Russian army who were much greater strategists than Danilov . But the latter was Sukhomlinov 's nominee , and Yanushkevich , having privately admitted to Danilov that he regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to make sure that the latter was given exactly the same decorations and promotions as himself , had come to the conclusion that it was after all better to leave Danilov in the job . Like two boats secured to each other , only together could they sail through this war : Yanushkevich looked after the administrative side ; Danilov after the strategy . Yanushkevich went through agony every morning during the inevitable conferences on operational matters , but he was obliged to look as if he knew what he was talking about . But now the effort required was far greater : he had to maintain sufficient dignity so that no one would suspect how terrified he was of tripping up and how desperately inadequate he felt , How could he possibly criticize Zhilinsky , when the latter was a full general and , although formally his subordinate , in fact senior to him in the general staff list , and when he himself had been promoted to lieutenant general ahead of his proper seniority ? In carefully rounded phrases delivered in a respectful tone of voice , Yanushkevich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding nothing and missing nothing , simply altering the sequence of their remarks . A ND SO IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR to the conference just how deeply General Samsonov was to blame for the destruction of Second Army . What a relief that he had removed himself by committing suicide . The other generals , of course , would never have made the same mistakes . And therefore the meeting had lost much of its tenseness ; everything had been exhaustively discussed , every point covered . Meanwhile , Vorotyntsev , his pencil racing nervously across a sheet of paper on his map board , had been noting down their excuses and evasions , together with a shattering series of counter-arguments . Higher up on the same sheet of paper , in a steadier and more even hand , written the night before in black ink with a Japanese fountain pen , he had listed the main points of his case , When Yanushkevich spoke , he did not even bother to make notes ; scarcely listening , he half closed his eyes to avoid the sight of them all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's frank , guileless features  --  not as they must be now , lying in some unknown forest thicket , or as they were at Orlau when he had said farewell to his men , but at Ostrolenka , when he was still fully in charge , still capable of saving the battle ( though even then there had been something helpless about his expression ) . And Vorotyntsev remembered the push , like wild boars , through the undergrowth as they escaped , remembered Kachkin 's wild-boar grin as he carried Ofrosimov on his shoulders , and how Blagodaryov had collapsed when they reached the Russian lines as though he had just plowed two or three hundredacres , and how as a final gesture he had thrust the point of his knife into the ground with his last strength . Vorotyntsev started up from his chair as though about to stand and speak without permission , but Svechin. , who was beside him , squeezed his elbow to advise caution . The Grand Duke did not look in his direction . With one thin cavalryman 's leg crossed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moustaches turned slightly downward , the Grand Duke stared ahead , and if he did look at anyone in particular he glared straight down the table into the grayish-yellow face of Zhilinsky with its idiotically raised eyebrows . Only recently , in response to complaints , he had personally empowered Zhilinsky to dismiss Samsonov if it proved necessary , but since yesterday it had become more and more obvious to him that it was Zhilinsky who was chiefly to blame for the catastrophe ; his immediate dismissal would be a most suitable demonstration of the Commander-in-Chief 's powers and the best possible lesson to the other generals . ft would , however , be a pointless move : Zhilinsky 's post as commander of Northwestern Army Group was too low for a man of his seniority , and he would be glad to be rid of it . He would immediately rush to Petersburg to complain to the Empress Dowager and the Tsarina , to whisper in corners with Sukhomlinov , and to smile at Rasputin . In the overheated atmosphere of court politics , anything was likely to be seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going badly , it was because he lacked the qualities of a Supreme Commander ; if things were going well , it was said that he was ambitious , that he was a threat to the imperial family , and that he was acting the part of " Nicholas III . " The Lord above knew how deeply the Grand Duke grieved over the loss of the flower of his officer corps and the desperate sufferings of his troops caught in the German encirclement . But even the loss of seventy thousand men as casualties and prisoners of war was not the loss of Russia ; Russia was a hundred and seventy million people . And to save them all , one must win not merely a battle or two at the front but first and foremost the much more serious battle going on at court to gain the heart of his beloved Emperor . To do this , he would have liked to ger rid of the odious Sukhomlinov , banish the filthy Rasputin ( or , better still , hang him ) , and finally , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nunnery . ( This was , of course , impossible ; the Tsar would never agree to it and the Grand Duke was incapable of acting against the Tsar 's wishes , and yet ... for Russia 's sake . . . he could still dream of it . ) In order not to spoil the chances of carrying out this plan , it was important for the time being not to strengthen the hand of the court party by provoking the ill will of Zhilinsky . Out of love for Greater Russia the Grand Duke had to stifle his feelings of pity and affection for that microcosm of Russia represented by Samsonov 's army , which by now was in any case annihilated . Nevertheless , it was necessary to shock Zhilinsky , to give him a thorough fright by letting Vororyntsev loose on him . The Grand Duke had not forgotten Vororyntsev all this time ; he had been watching the man 's unease and suppressed fury out of the corner of his eye . Outside , the weather was as gloomy as ever , the rain still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dark that they turned on the electric light . The whitewashed walls made the room appear very bright , and everything stood out in the sharpest detail . It was now the turn of the diplomat who represented the Foreign Office at General Headquarters . He asked the generals not to forget Russia 's relations with foreign states , her obligations , and other factors of external policy . France was convinced that Russia was capable of making an enormous contribution to the common cause . The French government had been making representations to the Russian government suggesting that Russia had so far failed to put her full military potential into the field ; that the advance into East Prussia was a halfhearted measure ; that according to French intelligence  --  which admittedly contradicted the information available to the Russians  --  far from having transferred two army corps from the Western to the Eastern front , the Germans had transferred them from the Russian front to the West , and that as an ally France had the right to remind Russia of her promise to launch an energetic advance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one take no notice of a tactless or improper word spoken in polite society , so all the grand dukes and generals now ignored that last embarrassing word , some by gazing out the window , some by looking at the wall opposite them , others by staring down at their papers . In actual fact , the word " Berlin " had not been uttered . But the diplomat 's implication had been uncomfortably accurate : everyone knew that it was the Tsar 's wish that they should come to the aid of their French ally at all costs and with all possible speed . Naturally , the Russian losses were painful to bear , but the important thing was not to let the Allies down . The Chief of Army Communications then reported that the German front was being reinforced at full pressure , for which purpose a steady stream of troops was being transferred from the military command of Asiatic Russia . At this moment three Caucasian army corps  --  one from Turkestan and two from Siberia  --  were on their way or were already detraining in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the material preparations for an immediate Russian counterattack , so essential from a moral point of view , were already well under way . This , said Zhilinsky , was the reason he was asking those present at the conference to give him permission to repeat : he operation around the Masurian Lakes . V OROTYNTSEV KNEW THAT IF HE JUMPED to his feet now he would not only lose everything his rank , his seniority , his whole army career  --  but that the top of his own head was likely to explode vial the sheer pent-up pressure of frustration . Lies , lies , ies ! Were there no limits to this man 's falsehood ? Wrenchng his elbow out of Svechin 's grip and forgetting that peakers were not supposed to stand up at this conference , le rose in fury . His wrath was so great that he had forgotten low he had intended to start his speech . Then he heard he firm voice of the Grand Duke : " I shall now ask Colonel Torotyntsev to give a report on his personal impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's headlong , passionate , overmastering anger vas only too visible ; then discretion gained the upper hand . nd he took a grip on his pounding heart as he remembered the proverb " Master of your own anger  --  master of all . " " This conference is all the more necessary , Your Imperial Highness , since Rennenkampf 's army is threatened at this very moment and may suffer an even worse fate than Sam-sonov 's . " ( Too loud ; keep it quieter , do n't show your feelings so openly . ) Everyone present , including the Grand Duke , shuddered and stirred uneasily as though someone had smashed a windowpane and the cold , wet wind was raging in from outside . His self-control increasing from sentence to sentence , Vorotyntscv gave what appeared to be a carefully prepared speech in which all viewpoints were judiciously weighed . " Gentlemen ! No one from Second Army has been invited to this conference ; indeed , there is practically no one left to invite . But I was there during the last few days and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would have been expressed by men who are now dead or have been taken prisoner . I shall speak with the frankness which soldiers are taught to use and for which the dead may be forgiven ... " ( He must keep his voice from breaking , must not gulp for breath ! ) " . .. I shall not speak of the gallantry shown by the men and their officers  --  no one at this meeting has cast any doubt on that . The names of certain regimental commanders  --  Pervushin , Alexeyev , Kahanov , Kakhovskoy ? deserve to be recorded in the annals of bravery . The fact that upward of fifteen thousand men escaped from encirclement is due to the efforts of a few men at the level of colonel and staff captain , and to no one seated here ! Whenever the Germans had less than a twofold superiority in artillery , and sometimes even when they did , our units won the tactical battle . Under the heaviest possible bombardment they held their defensive lines for hours , as did the Vyborg Regiment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was fought at army level resulted not merely in failure , as has been suggested here , but in total rout ! " He stressed the word so violently that the whole room almost exploded . The blast of it lashed across the generals ' faces . The word " rout " was a challenge even to the Commander-in-Chief . He could not admit that much to the Tsar , despite his intention to hang his head in shame before His Majesty . He could not admit it , but he did not interrupt Vorotyntsev . Dignified , stern , aristocratic , he sat proudly and stiffly , so close by birth yet still so far from the seat of monarchy . " ... I have heard today how all the blame lies with General Samsonov . How convenient ; the dead , after all , can not answer back . It is particularly convenient since it absolves all of us here from any need to make amends . Convenient it may be , but if no changes are made  --  if you will forgive me for assuming the self-imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated and we shall lose the whole war ! " There was a rustle of indignation . Zhilinsky raised his dull eyes to the Commander-in-Chief with a look which said it was high . time to make this impertinent colonel stop talking and sit down . But the Grand Duke , who could act sharply enough when he wanted to , did not move his stiffly upright head . He showed only that he was master of the situation . " ... Furthermore , on behalf of the late Alexander Vasilievich Samsonov , I feel obliged to object to those who have already spoken . When he arrived at Bialystok from Turkestan , it was his opinion that the plan prepared in advance ordering him to move his army forward into the depths of the Masurian Lakes region , into an obvious geographical vacuum , was absurd . He wrote his alternative operational proposals in a detailed report to the Commander-in-Chief , and on July 29 he handed it to Lieutenant General Oranovsky , chief of staff of the Army Group ! " ( Your voice is getting shriller  --  keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Days passed and he grew uneasy . No reply to his report was forthcoming . He asked me specifically to clarify the matter at General Headquarters , and only yesterday I discovered that the Grand Duke had never been given the report ! " Zhilinsky , the " living corpse , " gave Vorotyntsev a deathly stare . As the Commander-in-Chief himself said nothing , he felt the moment had come to intervene . " I know nothing of this report . " " So much the worse for you , Your Excellency ! " Vorotyntsev seemed positively pleased at this interruption , which gave him the opportunity to turn on Zhilinsky . " That means the truth can not be discovered without a court of inquiry ! And if one is held , I shall request the court to find that paper . " Once again a shiver of horror crossed the generals ' faces . It was already clear what kind of a court inquiry this impudent colonel ... Everyone stared at the Commander-inChief : this mad colonel must be stopped ! But the Grand Duke kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . His voice for once losing its characteristic dryness , sky strongly protested : " Most probably General Samsonos withdrew his report and took it back . " Vorotyntsev , as if he had been waiting for this objection retaliated hotly : " No , he did not take it back , that has been verified ! " And he stared unwaveringly back at Zhilinsky , tht Zhilinsky who at Ostrolenka , at Neidenburg , at Orlau had been an invisible presence , but was now sitting an arm 's length away  --  a deathly gray , bony old man with a stiff back who suffered from a continual need to go to the lavatory . " The variation in the axis of advance , which General Samsonov proposed and which he partially put into effect , was a correct one , because it meant outflanking the enemy far more deeply than was proposed by Army Group Headquarters ; its only defect was that it did not go deep enough . And the over-extension of the army 's frontage was due in no less a degree to the Army Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the gap on the edge of the Masurian Lakes . " " That was not a gap  --  that was the boundary between the two armies , where they were supposed to link up ! " Zhilinsky interrupted in a firmer and sharper voice than before . By now Vorotyntsev was aware of a tacit agreement between himself and the Commander-in-Chief : the latter was not going to interrupt him . And none of the other generals , singly or together , was in a position to contradict him . He had made the breakthrough . His mission had not been in vain . Cooler now , his tone more judicious and his lips twisted in sarcasm , he mercilessly thrashed Zhilinsky with sentence after sentence , each one curling like a whiplash . " How could the two armies link up , when one of them was being made to advance by forced marches and the other had practically been sent on leave ? How could they link up , when after the battle of Gurnbinnen five of General Rennenkampf 's cavalry divisions failed to set off in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Second Army at the time when it was in crucial trouble ? It almost seems as if Army Group Headquarters purposely made it impossible to coordinate the actions of the two armies by ordering First Army co advance a week earlier than Second Army . Why was this so ? Or was it intended to link the two armies by transferring General Scheidemann 's corps to Rennenkampf on August 10 , and then on the fourteenth ordering it to go to Warsaw ? Apparently it was not needed in East Prussia on the very day that the decisive battle was being fought that was to seal the fate of Second Army . " How on earth did Vorotyntsev know about that particular episode ? Here was an error of which General Headquarters itself was guilty . Danilov glanced suspiciously at Svechir and said uneasily : ' ' That was done for strategic considerations . Ninth Army was being prepared to advance or Berlin ... " " Meanwhile , Second Army could be thrown to the wolves I suppose ? " Vorotyntsev rudely cut him off . " All the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 15 , and yet Army Group Headquarters ordered it to march in the wrong direction ! But on the sixteenth tha corps was ordered back to Warsaw , and on the seventeend General Rennenkampf redirected it northward  --  was tha the linkup of the two armies ? And yet Northwestern Arm ' Group was created solely to coordinate the actions of Firs and Second Armies . General Samsonov has been accuse ( of showing a lack of decisiveness , but what more crass example of indecision could there be than the Army Group Commander 's when , on the grounds of ' security , " guarding the lines of communication ; ' covering the rear , ' etc. he refused to allow half the army to move farther forward than Bischofsburg and Soldau ! " Vorotyntsev had pressed home his point with such vehemence that Zhilinsky 's moustaches , which were already trembling with fury , looked as if they might go up in smoke at any moment . " Half the army ? What do you mean  --  half the army ? " There was a buzz of objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  g ? , a colonel who went by the nickname of " Brother Cain . " " Just count , gentlemen . Two army corps , one on the right flank and one on the left , and three cavalry divisions  --  that makes up exactly half the army . And with the other half Sainsonov was ordered to advance and win a victory . And if Army Group had to keep control of the flanking corps , then the very least it should have done was to move them in to help out the center corps when it was in trouble . Yes , I agree that General Samsonov made mistakes , but they were tactical mistakes . The strategic mistakes must he laid at the door of Army Group Headquarters . Samsonov on his own did not have numerical superiority over the enemy , but Army Group did , and in spite of that the battle was lost . We must draw our conclusions , gentlemen  --  otherwise , what is the point of this conference ? What , in the end , is the point of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deploying units bigger than a regiment  --  that is the conclusion ! " " Your Highness , I request you to put an end to this colonel 's idiotic remarks ! " Zhilinsky demanded , thumping the table to show that he was not yet quite a " corpse . " The Grand Duke stared coldly at Zhilinsky with his large , expressive , oval eyes . Then he said firmly and quietly : " Colonel Vorotyntsev is talking sense . I myself have learned much from what he has said . In my opinion , General Headquarters " ? here he looked at Danilov , who lowered his bovine forehead , a movement politely imitated by Yanushkevich ? " exerted practically no direction over this operation at all , entrusting it entirely to Northwestern Army Group . " He knew quite well how worthless Danilov was . Often , when reading reports that Danilov had himself prepared , the Grand Duke was far quicker at grasping the gist than the slow-witted general . " And if the colonel commits an error , you are always at liberty to correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the call of nature . ? T HE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF felt greatly tempted . The facts of the case had all been given . They should be studied further , and a court of inquiry set up . Zhilinsky should be dismissed with ignominy , and General Headquarters would be in the clear . However , by his gracious telegram of the day before , the Tsar had shown the Grand Duke a way out : the way of forgiveness , of letting bygones be bygones . Also , another imperial edict , as yet unannounced , had just arrived , authorizing Oranovsky 's promotion to the rank of full general ; matters Harvey Dinnerslain 67 concerning promotion took their course independently of the progress of war , and there was no holding them up . Just as the cavalry , having broken through a defensive position with some losses , has a free hand to ravage the enemy 's rear , so Vorotyntsev now had a chance to gallop around and deal out a few more saber blows . The real conference , in fact , was only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with broader issues . What was it that sapped the strength of Second Army ? It was having to march on foot across our own deserted , trackless Russian territory . Even before reaching the frontier , even before making contact with the enemy , the troops had to spend five , six days slogging their way through sand ! And then we had to transport ammunition , guns , food , supplies , across that same expanse  --  and what with ? With inadequate transport . Why were no supplies built up in readiness along the frontier before the war began ? " Yanushkevich frowned . It was positively painful to have to listen to this unrepentant " young Turk " from Golovin 's class at the General Staff Academy . Why was the Grand Duke subjecting them to this torture ? If we had done so , the enemy might have seized those supplies , " he explained cuttingly from under his bushy moustache . But really , " Vorotyntsev remonstrated , his jaw mottled purple with anger , " is it preferable to lose twenty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen military storage depots ? " " The storage depots were not built near the frontier , " Danilov confidently insisted , " because we had not planned to conduct an offensive on that front , but to defend it . " This was true . In mentioning it , however , he had touched on the fact that the whole war plan had been hastily altered ? altered , indeed , by none other than Zhilinsky himself during his time as Chief of the General Staff , an action which had been approved not only by the War Minister , but by the Tsar himself . This was the new plan which the Grand Duke had been forced to accept a month ago . Here Vorotyntsev was on thin ice and could venture no further . He was just about to make another pointed remark when the door opened and Zhilinsky waddled back to his seat . " . . But the chief reason why Samsonov 's army was destroyed was that it , like the rest of the Russian army , was not ready to advance so soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being attainable two months after the date of mobilization . A month at the very Least was needed to enable any sort of advance to take place . " Zhilinsky had reached his sear , but he did not sit down . The discussion was getting too near the bone , so he remained standing , facing Vorotyntsev , his fists resting on the table . Throwing out his chest like a boxer , purple in the face with tension , Vorotyntsev aimed his remarks at Zhilinsky alone . " The fatal decision was taken when , out of a desire to please the French , we gave that lighthearted promise to begin war operations on the fifteenth day of mobilization , a date on which the Russian army would be at one-third readiness ! What incompetence  --  to promise to send our forces into battle only partly mobilized and wholly unprepared ! " " Your Highness ! " Zhilinsky exclaimed to the Grand Duke . " This is an insult to Russia 's national honor ! The decision was approved by the Tsar ! By the convention signed with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander-in-Chief 's patience with him , Vorotyntsev hurled back an answer vivid with hatred : " According to that convention , Russia promised ' decisive help , ' not suicide ! It was your signature which committed Russia to suicide , Your Excellency ! " ( Yanushkevich , his head lowered cravenly , was forgotten . It was he who had demanded of Northwestern Army Group that the advance should start four days earlier than planned . . . ) " It was signed by the War Minister , too ! " shouted Zhilinsky , but in a voice that was beginning to crack and had lost its force . " And approved by His Majesty . An officer like you has no business to be at General Headquarters ! And no business to be in the Russian army either ! Your Imperial Highness ... ! " Handsome and dignified as ever , the Grand Duke sat as though carved in stone , half turned from the table , one leg crossed over the other . To Vorotyntsev he said sadly , but with stony insistence : " Yes , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not for this that I allowed you to speak . " His speech was over  --  the last words , perhaps , of his whole military career . Yet it pained him not to be able to say one final thing : not to speak what he knew to be true was unbearable . Having lost everything , having nothing more to fear , free of all inhibitions , seeing with his mind 's eye the men of the Dorogobuga Regiment bearing their dead colonel on their shoulders , carrying the wounded lieutenant , seeing Staff Captain Semechkin , that bold , cheerful , little turkey cock of a man , breaking his way through the German lines with two companies of the Zvenigorod Regiment , Vorotyntsev turned and gave a ringing reply to the Commander-in-Chief : " Your Imperial Highness ! Like you and like General Zhilinsky , I too am an officer of this army , and all we Russian officers bear a responsibility for the history of Russia . We simply can not be allowed to go on losing campaign after campaign . Tomorrow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Suddenly the Grand Duke flared up in one of his rare bursts of anger and cut him short : " Colonel ! Leave this conference ! " Vorotyntsev felt a great sense of relief and freedom : the burning arrow had been wrenched out of his chest . Yet it had taken some flesh with it too . He said no more . He sprang to attention , his hands down the seams of his trousers . He turned about with a click of the heels and marched toward the door . Through the door , toward him , came an aide-de-camp , beaming with delight . " Your Imperial Highness ! A telegram from the Southwestern Front ! " This was it . This was what they had been waiting for . Turning , the Grand Duke stood up . The others rose . " Gentlemen ! The mother of God has not abandoned Holy Russia ! The city of Lvov has been captured . A colossal victory . We must give the news to the press . " ? * * ? UNTRUTH DID NOT BEGIN WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
