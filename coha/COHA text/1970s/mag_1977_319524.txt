Long before the March SALT standoff in Moscow , the central issue in the U.S.-Soviet arms race had become the increasing vulnerability of land-based ICBMS to surprise enemy attack . In recent months , U.S. defense officials and strategic analysts have warned repeatedly that the Soviets were rapidly increasing their ability to destroy American missiles . Meanwhile , although the fact has received surprisingly little publicity , the U.S. is on the verge of taking a big step forward in its own ability to knock out Soviet ICBMS in their steel-and-concrete silos . The startling success of the new program has important implications for the delicate balance of terror between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . The developments are bound to be an important factor when the two nuclear superpowers begin low-key SALT talks next week in Geneva , in an attempt to work out a new agreement to replace the current , stop-gap measure that expires in October . <P> Even Odds . As it happens , October is also the month when the U.S. is scheduled to begin modernizing its 550 land-based Minuteman III missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final stage of the missile . The system will double the accuracy , or halve the " circular error probability , " of each of the 1,650 Minuteman warheads . The current version has a fifty-fifty chance of falling within 1,200 ft. of its target ; the new model would be even odds to land within 600 ft. ( see diagram ) . <P> A second and equally important phase of upgrading the Minuteman III will begin in the fall of 1979 , when the missile 's Mk-12 warhead will be replaced with the Mk-12A . Using miniaturized arming and fusing components , the new warhead will be able to contain enough payload to double its explosive yield from 170 kilotons to 350 kilotons of TNT . This is still far below the 1 megaton ( 1,000 kilotons ) clout of each of the eight warheads carried in the huge SS-18 that the Soviet Union is already deploying . But , with the improved guidance system , the Mk-12A will be much more accurate than an SS-18 warhead , and as a result will have an 80% plus chance of destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Soviet warhead has a " hard target kill probability " estimated at less than 60% . <P> This breakthrough dramatically illustrates American technological superiority over the Russians . But it also poses difficult problems in arms control . The advances add one more complex variable to the equation of mutual deterrence . About 75% of the Soviets ' 3,500 warheads are carried by land-based missiles that would be vulnerable to the Mk-12A ( in contrast , more than 60% of the 8,500 American warheads are mounted on Poseidon and Polaris missiles in submarines ) . Understandably , the Soviet Union is concerned about the new American warheads . Last week Georgy Arbatov , head of Moscow 's U.S.A. Institute , which analyzes American affairs and advises the Kremlin , was spreading the word in Washington that the upcoming improvements were more worrisome to him than the advanced U.S. ICBM-the M-X- which still exists only on paper , or the cruise missile , which has yet to be deployed and is too slow to be used in a surprise attack .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
