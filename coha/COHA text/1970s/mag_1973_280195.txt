" Without a doubt it is a political trial , the biggest political trial to unfold in Italy since after the war . I am not accused of having done anything , such as broken anybody 's head , but only of having thought or said certain things . If I get up and say ' Viva il Duce ! ' I can go to jail for twelve years . If a Socialist does it , nothing happens . " <P> The speaker was Giorgio Almirante , 58 , the dapper chieftain of the far right , neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement ( M.S.I. ) , the country 's fourth largest political party . Two weeks ago , he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity by an overwhelming vote of his fellow members of the Chamber of Deputies , who were responding to a nationwide outcry against a wave of Fascist-inspired violence ( TIME , May 21 ) . As a result of the vote , Almirante may be tried for the constitutional crime of " reconstituting the Fascist Party . " Possible sentence : three to twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almirante in Rome . Bonfante 's report : <P> His words seemed to convey the utmost reasonableness . There was none of the jut-jawed belligerence of a Duce , none of the menacing rhetoric of a swaggering martinet . In fact , an ironic , Pirandellian sense of split realities was inescapable . Here was a former functionary of Benito Mussolini 's last government denouncing the " totalitarian " ways of contemporary Italy . <P> Almirante suggested that if he ever goes to trial , he will turn the proceedings into a Roman circus . " I am going to call all the other political parties as witnesses , " he said , " because all of them have collaborated with us at one time or another . " While he did not minimize the violence that provoked the parliamentary vote against him , he blamed most of it on leftists and the rest on an anti-M.S.I. conspiracy on the part of the government : " I have also accused the Ministry of the Interior itself of having organized the violence of those rightist groups , organized them against us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced , will backfire badly . If convicted , he said with a smile , he would accept his fate ; he evidently envisions a useful kind of martyrdom . During his imprisonment , he proclaimed , " Our battle , our movement , would become very much stronger . " <P> Is M.S.I , a Fascist organization ? " We do not intend to separate ourselves from the movement of history , " Almirante answered carefully . " I am inspired neither by Fascism nor by antiFascism . If Mussolini were alive today and said the things he used to say , he would make the Italians laugh . " However , added Almirante , " if he were alive today , he would be a postFascist like me , and he would say different things . Everything has changed . Do you want me to appear on the balcony and exhort the country to go to war ? That 's laughable now . But I do not spit on that past . I am not ashamed of having lost the war . I did my duty , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
