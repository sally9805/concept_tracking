txt Chicavo Tribune Press Service WASHINGTON ? If the truth were more widely known , Abraham Lincoln might not be so beloved by Americansesnecially on April 15 . It was the Great Emancipator , you see , who instituted America 's first federal income tax . The dark deed was done July 1 , 1862 , ottnn Lincoln signed a bill creating a 11 , , ' of new federal taxes and an Inter11 , , I Revenue Commission to collect them . The nation had been plunged Into the Civil War and government spending was 20 times what it had been in peacetime . With the government deeply in debt , Lincoln and the Congress desperately needed new sources of revenue . INCLUDED IN THE bill were new taxes on estates , public utilities , liquor , Wins , banks , insurance companies , tobacco , beet , railroads , ferry boats , playing cards , and  --  for the first time in our history  --  incomes . Though the government appealed to the patriotism of every American , the measure was not overly popular . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principle , " said David Wells , a taxation expert of the period , Postal aid for taxpayers Curbside pickup service will he provided until midnight Friday at the Main Post Office , 433 W. Van Buren St. , for lost-minute filers of income tax returns . " was akin to that recommended to the traditionary Irishman on his visit to Donnybrook Fair : Whenever you see a bead , hit it ; whenever you find an article , a product , a trade , a profession , or a source of income , tax it . LINCOLN 'S INCOME tax , of course , was to be applied to the southern states as well , giving the Confederacy even more incentive to win the war . The government previously had been skittish about imposing any federal taxes , relying on customs duties for most of its revenue . British taxes had been largely responsible for provoking the American Revolution , and one of the first taxes imposed by our own government  --  a federal excise tax on whisky  --  sparked the 1794 Whisky Rebellion In western Pennsylvania .

One foe called It a " horror of all free states . . . hostile to the liberties of the people " that would " convulse the government , let loose a swarm of harpies , who , under the domination of the revenue officers , will range the country prying Into every man 's house and affairs , and , like the Macedonian phalanx , bear down all before them . " When Thomas Jefferson became President in 1801 , he abolished the federal excise tax system and fired all 400 revenue agents . On limited means , the country could n't afford much of an Army or Navy , but this bothered no one until the War of 1812 . To raise the funds for the war , Congress assessed all 18 states on a population basis , leaving it up to each state government to decide what tax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1817 . From then until 1862 , the government levied no internal taxes at all . In fact , it made so much money from // Column 1 . Federal income tax is Lincoln heritage // duties and federal land sales , it was often able to boast of budgetary surpluses , a boast little heard today . Then came the Civil War , and Lincoln 's draconian measure . If one must pay an income tax , Lincoln 's was certainly preferable to today 's . Though it applied to all incomes over $600 , the highest tax rate was only 3 per cent . Taxpayers were permitted up to 10 deductions , including one for state and local taxes paid ; income from government bonds ; income from interest or dividends from bank deposits and stock ; farm insurance ; and such business expenses as fuel , freight , and whatever then passed for the martini lunch . And , as is not true today , rent payments were also deductible . AS IS TRUE TODAY , living in sin had tax benefits .

Taxpayers of that period had little need for a tax consultant , as the returns were easily understood , The most complicated phrase was something like " from all sources not herein enumerated . " The filing date for the returns was a leisurely first Monday in May . THE VERACITY OF each rot= bad to be sworn to a tax assessor . Penalties for fraud and evasion were fines of up to $500 . Even one day 's delay in filing a return would result in a penalty of 50 per cent of the tax owed . There was no appeal . Maintaining the income tax to finance " reconstruction " of the South . in the postwar period , Congress reduced the tax rates in 1870 and let the tax law itself expire in 1872 . The government struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oleomargarine passed in 1886 and one on the sale of opium in 1890 . Marijuana . was also legal then but apparently was not taxed . These taxes did not keep pace with government spending , however , and in 1894 Congress reactivated the income tax . But not for long . During the Lincoln era , there were those who thought the income tax unconstitutional but who were unwilling to take their case to court , THIRTY YEARS LATER , willingness had increased remarkably . A suit was filed and , m en 1895 decision , the United States Supreme Court ruled the tax unconstitutional , because the tax burden was apportioned on the basis of income rather than population . Support for an incense tax grew , nevertheless . Though denounced by conservatives as " a tool of Socialism "  --  the graduated income tax was a tenet of Marx 's Communist Manifesto  --  the tax was championed by the Greenback , Anti-Monopoly , and Populist Parties as a means of curbing robber barons . Teddy Roosevelt came out strongly for reinstitution of the tax and his successor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a constitutional amendment permitting the tax .

More recently , a check-off scheme to earmark tax dollars for public campaign financing has been instituted . Otherwise , the changes in the income tax ' were predictable : The rates went higher and the tax law became more complicated . By 1944 , it had become so complicated that Congressman Robert L. " Millie " Doughton rose to complain to his colleagues that he had had to hire a tax consultant to help him prepare his return . Congressman Houghton was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
