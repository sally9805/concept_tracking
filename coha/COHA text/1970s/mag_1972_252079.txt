The weekend in New Orleans was billed as a super sports spectacular . When all the drumbeating and body crunching were over , however , the result was a pair of super slaughters . First , Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier bludgeoned Challenger Terry Daniels to the canvas five times before the referee mercifully ended the mismatch in the fourth round . Then the Dallas Cowboys took over where Frazier left off , pounding the Miami Dolphins into the Poly-Turf for four long , punishing quarters . <P> Among other things , the Cowboys ' dominance of Super Bowl VI destroyed a myth . Going into the game , the Dolphins were likened to the New York Mets of 1969 , the pesky upstarts who won the World Series against lopsided odds . Like the miracle Mets , the Dolphins were a Cinderella team that rallied from defeat to challenge for the championship . They were young . They had the rabid backing of their fans . They made a habit of come-from-behind victories . And , headed by those happy Hungarians , Running Backs Larry Csonka and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to conquer all . <P> The Cowboys , on the other hand , came on as a gang of jaded old pros more interested in winning salary increases than games . They were called " unemotional . " They supposedly reflected the cold , clinical approach of Coach Tom Landry and the computers he used to analyze the Dolphins ' defenses . They had failed to win the Big Game so often in the past that some of their own fans labeled them " choke artists . " Worse yet , the team was reported to be riven by dissent . The surly silence of Running Back Duane Thomas , in fact , gave rise to the rumor that the moody black Cowboys ' star would not even bother to suit up for the game . <P> Not a chance . Driven by pride and the promise of a $15,000 payoff for each player on the winning team , Thomas and the rest of the Cowboys rolled over Miami like an automated machine . In the battle of the quarterbacks , the Dolphins ' Bob Griese proved no match for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a costly fumble and an interception , was stymied at every turn by the Cowboys ' tenacious Doomsday Defense . Staubach , meanwhile , piloted the Cowboys ' ball-control offense to perfection . Sending Running Backs Thomas , Walt Garrison and Calvin Hill through holes as broad as a boulevard , he set up a pair of neatly executed scoring passes . Final score : Dallas 24 , Miami 3 . <P> Football Dynasty . It remained for CBS-TV Commentator Tom Brookshier to provide some comic relief . While conducting the ritual post-game interviews in the jubilant Cowboys ' locker room , he suddenly found himself staring into the baleful eyes of Duane Thomas . Sportswriters had unsuccessfully been trying to interview Thomas for weeks . Making the least of the moment , the visibly flustered Brookshier posed a long convoluted question that seemed to translate : Are you as fast as you seem to be ? " Evidently , " said the unsmiling Thomas while his teammates roared with laughter . ' I 'm nervous , " admitted Brookshier . He tried another less than incisive question : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Said Thomas : " Yeah , I do . That 's why I 'm a football player . "
