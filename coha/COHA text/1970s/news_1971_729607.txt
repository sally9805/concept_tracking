txt The families of the two men who have lately walked on the frontiers of space live and work in an environment consecrated to the future . Yet they seem to possess elements of character that reach deep into the past , elements that were first shaped in frontier America . This is not true in a merely general sense ? as though they somehow embodied the collected values of the dear but irrecoverable past  --  but in the exact sense of their having brought certain modes into the present directly , and traceably , through their family lines . These families ? including parents and other close relatives  --  exhibit certain distinguishing features . The man is usually boss in the home . The children are strongly disciplined . The adults are generally , though not unanimously , abstemious , rarely drinking and still more rarely smoking . Some of them give little or no quarter to dancing , motion pictures or television . Strength in Prayer They are buoyed by strong , active religious beliefs  --  often of the Bible-toting , go-tomeeting kind  --  and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one of their members goes off to the moon . The family members appear to be unflinching , and very little fearful , in the acceptance of extraordinary hazards . In leisure , they show a marked preference for strenuous outdoor pastimes such as skiing and water-skiing over more desultory pleasures . These and other attributes are not necessarily typical of the astronauts as a whole . Maj. Alfred M. Worden , the crew member who stayed in lunar orbit , has a rather different case from that of Col. David R. Scott or Lieut . Col. James B. Irwin . Those who know them well say the behavior of astronauts and their families ranges over a fairly broad spectrum , from straight and square apple pie eaters to worldly men and women about town . Yet the character of the Scott , Irwin and Worden families says something about the character of the nation 's space program , not only about the kind of men who make it go but also about its implicit assumption that technology plus dedication plus exploration equals progress , For the Scotts and Irwins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated new technology has produced some uncommon characteristics . Colonel Irwin streaks off toward the moon on a rocket 's nose , yet he and his wife choose not to have a television set in their home for themselves or their four children . There is too much violence on it for their taste . An exception was made to this during the flight of Apollo 15 , but even then television was only coolly tolerated in the Irwin house . Colonel Scott calmly and confidently addresses mankind from the surface of the moon , yet , according to his father , the 39-year-old astronaut still says " Yes , sir " and " No , sir , " to his elders , as he was trained to do as a boy . Lean and Stylish These members of the rocket set tend to look as lean and stylish as members of the jet set . They have much the same casual assurance and zest for keeping on the go , and they scoot around in zippy sports cars , But here the similarities give way to differences , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Saturday of the space flight , at the hour her husband was taking his first moon walk , Mary Ellen Irwin stepped from her home to go to teach her weekly class of teen-agers in the Sabbath School at the Pasadena Seventh Day Adventist Church , 20 miles away . A bystander asked her , in evident surprise , if she was not going to watch her husband 's exploit . " Jim is doing his duty , and I must do mine , " she said crisply and moved on . To Mrs. Irwin , the Apollo 15 flight was , in a phrase , " God 's mission , " In separate and exclusive interviews , Mrs. Irwin and Lurton Scott , wife of the commander of the Apollo 15 mission , used almost identical terms when asked about pictures to be made when their husbands came home last Sunday night . Both women quicty but steadfastly refused to make the decision without asking the men . " I 'm not the boss in this house , " Mrs. Irwin explained emphatically when pressed to say yes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the boss , " Mrs. Scott said earlier . The women express a sort of hazy contempt for the principles of " women 's liberation " ? hazy because their view of it is very distant . " I honestly have n't been able to figure out what they want to be liberated from , " said Mrs , Irwin . " I think they 've missed ? the boat somewhere . Frankly , I like being a women . And being treated like one . " Some of the astronauts ' children had to be coaxed to abandon other pleasures long enough to watch the splashdown on television . For most of the children of the space families , orbital or lunar flight has been a part of life from their earliest memories and it is as common to their experience as the airplane or the longdistance telephone call is to most of ours . This is not true of the astronauts ' wives or their parents , some of whom find moon voyaging conceptually hard to digest . " Did you ever have the temptation to sneak out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it and think , ' Well , gee , my husband is up there ' ? " Mrs. Irwin was asked . ' Hard to Comprehend ' " Yes , I did one night after I went to bed , " she said . " I was resting in my bedroom and I had to get down on my knees to look up over the walls out there and it was shining down so brightly and beautifully . It was very hard to comprehend because it 's not tangible . " What is tangible to Mrs. Irwin is the space complex that straddles the busy fourlane highway , NASA Boule4 yard . The severely functional , box-like structures of the Manned Spacecraft Center . sprawl to one side of that strip . Across the highway there is a wall of whitewashed brick on which slender , finely carved gold lettering spells out Nassau Bay . Just beyond the entrance stands the fishshaped sanctuary of the Nassau Bay Baptist Church , to which Colonel Irwin and other astronauts belong . Beyond the church a community of commandingly handsome brick homes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotts , the lrwins and many other members of the space elite live .
