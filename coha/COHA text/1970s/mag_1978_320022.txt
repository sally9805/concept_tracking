Every winter the public is treated to a blizzard of year-end statistics purporting to measure the myriad business trends that affect the pocketbooks of everybody . Yet many Americans find that official Government indexes seem contradictory and confusing . The fault lies with the way statistics are compiled and reported . <P> Some , like the Consumer Price Index , are limited but fairly consistent and reliable estimates , while others , such as retail sales , inventories and quarterly productivity figures , are little better than ballpark guesses . One of the weakest is the index of leading indicators , which is supposed to foreshadow economic trends . Often the Commerce Department releases preliminary figures that give false signals and then , like Stalin rewriting history , subjects the numbers to revision after revision . Statistics can be made to dance to almost any tune , depending on how they are presented , particularly at year 's end . Warns Economist Walter Heller : " T is the season to be wary . " <P> One of the most important distinctions in reporting growth , inflation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year " or " fourth quarter to fourth quarter . " The difference can be substantial . Say that the economy rises fast during one year but is absolutely flat the next year . Even so , the averages would show a fairly strong year-over-year rise . <P> How can that be ? Well , the production index began the first year at 100 in January and rose to 110 in December . The next year was flat , so the index also measured 110 . No gain , right ? Not really . <P> In fact , the average for the first year was about 105 , and the average for the second year was 110 . Thus , when measured on a year-over-year or average basis , the second year would show a gain of about five points over the first . Of course it would be more accurate to use the **34;4706;TOOLONG measure , which would show no rise . If the forecasts of TIME 'S Board of Economists are correct , next year 's G.N.P . will rise about 2% year-over-year but will not increase at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
