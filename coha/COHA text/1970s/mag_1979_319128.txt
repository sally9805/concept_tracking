" It ca n't happen again . " That was the cocky mood along the eight blocks of Wall Street last week . A new generation of stockbrokers , analysts and specialists who have only read about the Great Crash confidently continued business as usual . A block from the New York Stock Exchange , Trinity Church , which was packed with prayerful people in October 1929 , did normal business . <P> But could that dreaded month when the bubble burst and the world plunged into a decade-long recession recur exactly 50 years later ? Many conditions today look frighteningly similar to those of late 1929 . Then the panic was spawned by the Federal Reserve 's attempt to nip speculation by raising the discount rate a full percentage point from 5% to 6% . The nation 's banks in 1929 had built up a pyramid of foreign debt . National City Bank judged that Peru had a " bad debt record , adverse moral and political risk , bad internal debt situation " - and then lent the country $90 million that was soon defaulted . Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru and other oil-poor developing countries . Consumers in the ' 20s had just discovered the installment plan and were plunging into debt to buy radios , refrigerators and that new Model A from Henry Ford . Their grandchildren now have " plastic money " in the form of credit cards and owe $292.5 billion . The ' 20s real estate boom was centered in Florida , had created millionaires and seemed to prove , then as now , that one rarely loses money buying land . Even President Carter 's insistence last week that the U.S. had a " good solid economy " stirred echoes of Herbert Hoover , another engineer President , who said two days after the Black Thursday of 1929 that the " fundamental business of the country is sound . " <P> But Wall Street today is also very different from what it was a half-century ago . Then the market and the country were in an ebullient mood ; optimism was king . The stock market law of gravity held that whatever goes up must go up again . During one day , RCA-the IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the stock market has had the blahs , reflecting national uncertainty about the future . This summer the Dow Jones industrial average had already declined 50% from its peak of 1051 in 1973 , when adjusted for inflation . Concludes Economist John Kenneth Galbraith , author of The Great Crash , a study of the 1929 debacle : " It would be hard to find any buildup of speculative hubris that would make us as vulnerable as we were in 1929 . " <P> The Wall Street player today is also not like the 1929 Fifth Avenue cook who quit because her mistress would not install a stock ticker in the kitchen or the shoeshine boy who passed on to Joseph Kennedy the insider 's tip to " buy oil and rails . " In the past decade , 7 million small investors have pulled their money out of Wall Street and spent it on real estate , gold or simply a new mink coat . Over half of today 's market is dominated by professional investors representing pension funds , insurance companies or mutual funds . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flyer than were their predecessors . As a result , the market is less fun but more stable .
