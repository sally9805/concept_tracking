From the time that the body was first discovered last year , doctors in the People 's Republic of China have been trying to find out what caused the death of the wife of a minor official named Li Tsang . Last week they released the results of their autopsy : Lady Li died of an apparent heart attack . Although there was nothing unusual about the cause of her death , the post-mortem examination at Hunan Medical College was somewhat out of the ordinary ; Lady Li , whose body was unearthed from a tomb outside the central Chinese city of Changsha , died at the age of 50 some 2,100 years ago . <P> Modern medical techniques have been used many times to examine the remains of long-buried people . Studies of mummies have revealed that many ancient Egyptians had dental problems , arthritis , pneumonia and plague . Egypt 's legendary Merneptah , the Pharaoh of the Hebrew Exodus , suffered from arteriosclerosis . But Lady Li 's body is unquestionably the best preserved ever to be subjected to a full-fledged autopsy . <P> Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by the pottery , clothing and other artifacts found inside that it had been built during the early Western Han Dynasty , which ruled China from 206 B.C. to A.D. 24 . The tomb was immediately recognized as a major historical and artistic find . But it was not until archaeologists began to exhume the body of Lady Li , whose husband was the Marquis of Tai , that they realized that they had made a significant scientific discovery as well . <P> Lady Li 's silk-wrapped body had been placed inside an airtight coffin that was the innermost of six boxes packed in five tons of charcoal , completely surrounded by a layer of white clay and , finally , buried under more than 60 ft. of earth . Furthermore , inside the inner coffin scientists found a reddish , mildly acid fluid containing mercurial compounds that preserved body moisture and helped retard decomposition . <P> Perfect Preservation . As a result of the conscientious efforts of the Han Dynasty embalmers , Lady Li 's body was in a remarkable state of preservation . Doctors who examined it discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mummy , but still moist . They also found the hair well anchored in the scalp and the joints still flexible . Although Lady Li 's brain had collapsed into a shapeless mass , her other internal organs were in excellent condition . <P> Specialists called in from Peking , Shanghai and Canton discovered from chemical analysis of Lady Li 's hair and tissues from her stomach , liver , muscles and bone that she had type A blood . Gynecological examination revealed that she had borne children . <P> X-ray examination showed that she had broken her right forearm ; the discovery of spots in her left lung confirmed that she had had tuberculosis ; and an examination of her gall bladder disclosed several gallstones . Her digestive tract showed that she had eaten melon shortly before her death ; 138 melon seeds were found , all undigested . <P> It took further study-and a little deductive reasoning-to determine why Lady Li died . The autopsy revealed that one of her coronary arteries was almost completely occluded by atherosclerosis .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
