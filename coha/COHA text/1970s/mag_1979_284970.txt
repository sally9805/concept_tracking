The Social Art <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> I was delighted to find so many pages devoted to the " new wave " architecture Jan. 81 . Imaginative , intelligent , graceful , it is an architecture with the courage to break from recent tradition while rediscovering lessons from the past . <P> <P> Jeffrey Horowitz Cambridge , Mass . <P> <P> U.S. architects have not by a long shot said " Goodbye to glass boxes and all that , " nor have their European colleagues . The clumsy-concrete school of architecture has simply expanded to include other materials . Any attempt to decorate it with art nouveau or similar elements , no matter how costly , can not hide the deadly ugliness ; even tombstones seem more lively . Thus Philip Johnson , as depicted on the cover of TIME , looks rather like an undertaker displaying just another type of luxury urn . <P> <P> Bernard Wagner Hamburg <P> Unlike their counterparts today , the Modernists-Le Corbusier , Mies van der Rohe , Wright and Gropius-cared about meeting the real needs of mankind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of relieving and uplifting the urban masses that lived in congested , unhealthy and degrading conditions . Modernism may have failed to remake the world , but it dared greatly . <P> <P> Harry J. Kelly Boston <P> Hooray for the demise of glass-boxed Mondrians , and hello to Robert Venturi 's " linguistic " variety . <P> <P> Mary Ellen Emig Evansville , Ind . <P> <P> Bravo for the splendid story " U.S. Architects . " But how about the unknown architects of America , who must make their way through energy-conservation restrictions , environmental impact regulations , lack of materials , increasing cost of living and low budgets ? <P> <P> Jean-Paul Gauberti Denver <P> The days of commitment to the sealed building with its complete surrender to energy-dependent systems are dead and gone . The energy crisis is not a temporary piece of bad luck . Radical changes must be made in today 's building industry , and it is the responsibility of U.S. architects to lead the way . <P> <P> Robert D. Vander Kooi Hudsonville , Mich . <P> <P> Opposition vs . Persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jan. 8 is full of the nastiest kind of bigotry-that which is expressed with a show of sweet reason and charity . " Oppose , " but do n't " persecute . " It matters little to the stunned brain in a fractured skull whether the deed was done in opposition or persecution . Give me straightforward ( pun intended ) , honest , hotheaded persecution always in preference to the cold slime of tolerance and fairness such as yours . <P> <P> William T. Wood New York City <P> As a heterosexual struggling to remain rational while attempting to understand homosexuality , I commend John Leo 's Essay . Certainly homosexuals deserve fair treatment , but as a fellow human being I reserve the right to tolerate any expression , belief , lifestyle , etc. , without being required to endorse it . <P> <P> Tom Throneberry Indianapolis
