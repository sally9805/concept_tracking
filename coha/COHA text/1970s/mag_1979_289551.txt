" The free-enterprise system has gone to hell " <P> The financially straitened Chrysler Corp . got a felicitously timed lift last week in its drive to persuade Washington to approve federal guarantees for loans from private banks . The Economic Development Administration decided to guarantee loans totaling $111.1 million for the Jones &; Laughlin Steel Corp . to install pollution control equipment . Though that guarantee was granted under a special Administration program to help steelmakers meet the heavy cost of complying with environmental rules , Chrysler officials are sure to cite it as a precedent in their push for much bigger guarantees . <P> Treasury Secretary G. William Miller turned down the company 's initial aid proposal partly because its $1.2 billion request seemed extravagant and partly because he wanted the automaker to induce unions , suppliers and other parties to join in its recovery effort . One intriguing possibility involves the United Auto Workers ' allowing Chrysler 's pension fund to be used as a source of cash-perhaps in exchange for worker representation on the board of directors or for some other say in management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees in the $500 million-to-$700 million range , it may have trouble getting action before the legislators adjourn , probably in November , after which the company 's petition might become an issue in the 1980 election campaign . <P> Last week Chrysler 's voluble chairman , Lee Iacocca , took his corporate aid campaign on the road . In a session with TIME , Iacocca was characteristically outspoken . Excerpts : <P> On the outlook . We are in a hell of a mess and that 's nothing to be proud of . The people at Chrysler look great even if the balance sheet looks lousy . It all comes down to the marketplace . We have to go head-to-head with every car there , and the key is the 1 million front-wheel-drive cars that we 'll have in 1981 . They 'll have the same interior dimensions , but they 'll be shorter , lighter and get 7 m.p.g. more on average than the compacts and subcompacts that they will replace . We will be profitable in ' 81-if we ca n't do that we should get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some big cars , but really our problem is that we have n't built enough gas guzzlers . That is where the money is , for the same reason that in a meat market there is a bigger margin on steak than on hamburger . <P> General Motors builds 70% of all big cars today , and they make a $2,000 profit on them while we 're making $700 on little cars . On top of that , they 've got Sevilles selling at $5,700 profit per car ; we do n't have those baubles in our candy store . And GM is the price leader ; it 's not going to raise its prices $ 1,000 on little cars just so we can break even . We 're the underdog , but that means we 've just got to do it smarter .
