" I really have no comment , " Mr. Bales said yesterday of Mr. Beame 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but previously he confirmed having been the guest of the consulting firm with the comment . " I guess it was a foolish thing to do .

He denounced critics of the city 's use of consultants as " anti-intellectual , " and said that the city had spent only $5.3-million in management consultant contracts last year , and that these had proved extremely good investments in improving city services and modernizing procedures . Hayes Tells of Savings Frederick O'R . Hayes , the city 's Budget Director , said in a memorandum to the Mayor that the $5.2-million in management ' consultant contracts last year had " clearly resulted in well over $100-million in more effective services or direct cost savings for the citizens of New York . " " For example , " Mr. Hayes said , " less than $1-million has ' , been paid for the development of management information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Using these systems , we have more than doubled the rate of capital construction , thus saving hundreds of millions of ( lollnrs ' by ? avolding ? - escalating building costs . " And the studies of the Finance Department have already saved the city over $1-million . " However , Lindsay administration officials declined to make public these studies and others on the police and now hospital corporation . All management consultant studies are obtained without competitive bidding , and are private studies , released only at the discretion of the Mayor . Mr. Hayes , whose report was made in response to inquiries by Mr. Beame , said that of the remaining fees , $34.7-million was for architectural , engineering or related physical design services Linked to Construction " This large volume of work is directly due to the rapid pace of the city 's capital construction program , " he said . " As the Controller himself notes in his letter , it would he unwise to subject these architectual and engineering contracts to Board of Estimate approval . " Mr. Beame said yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering contracts since 1965 . " A lot more work is being farmed out , " Mr. Beame said . " Greater use should he made of our own city employes , who have much greater knowledge of city problems .

" provide for the Institute of Public Administration and the Puerto Rican Forum to operate manpower training programs under the policy direction of the city 's Manpower and Career Development Agency . " Mr. Hayes acknowledged , however , that the subcontracts given out by the two agencies included architectural contracts and consulting contracts , as well as contracts for training and education . " The remainder of the contracts in the Controller 's list , amounting to $5.3-million , or some 8 per cent of the total , are for a variety of other professional services , " Mr. Hayes said . " Of this amount , the bulk of expenditures ( $4.7-million ) were for management analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public administration . " Mr. Hayes , who is leaving the Lindsay administration in September to return to private business , made no mention of $7-million in per-diem consultants reported by The Times on the basis of information obtained from the city 's administrations . The Budget Director said that the most significant management consultant studies were : ( iDevelopment of a management information system to control and expedite the city 's capital construction program .

The assistance has been invaluable in the city 's efforts to mount such new programs as the Brooklyn Model Cities sanitation and emergency repair projects , and the lead poisoning detection program , he said . cJRand Corporation studies that included the invention of " slippery water , " which doubles the water-delivery capacity of fire engines . In a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know when this administration entered office in 1965 , it found that many agencies in this , the nation 's largest municipal government , had little or no analytic capacity , and were unable to establish intelligent priorities for our scarce resources . " " One of the many means we have used to improve our government has been to seek out the talent of the best and most knowledgeable management and systems analysts in the country , " Mr. Hayes said .
