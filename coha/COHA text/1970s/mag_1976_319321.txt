THE POVERTY OF POWER by BARRY COMMONER 314 pages . Knopf. $10 . <P> This book attempts the impossible - but then again , that is the author 's trademark . It was Microbiologist Commoner who most convincingly alerted Americans to the environmental crisis ( TIME cover , Feb. 2 , 1970 ) . It was also Commoner who first suggested-in his 1971 bestseller The Closing Circle-that U.S. industry be restructured to conform to ecology 's unbending laws . Specifically , he recommended that polluting products ( detergents , for example , or synthetic textiles ) be replaced by good old natural ones ( soap , or cotton and wool ) . Just how to accomplish such a major switch in industrial direction Commoner did not say and of course not much of what he hoped for came about . Now he is trying to close the circle in a different way . The Poverty of Power is a closely reasoned , adult primer on energy , examined in relation to several laws of science and economics . First are the laws of thermodynamics , which he uses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's oil , coal and uranium is wasted . Commoner shows how the environment is harmed by the industries that use the most energy-petrochemicals , transportation , agriculture . Finally , the economy is affected too . Because the nation 's fuels are irreplaceable resources , the energy industries have naturally used the most accessible reserves first . Now , says Commoner , the law of diminishing returns must take effect : the costs of getting the same fuels necessarily have to mount . The rising cost of energy , in turn , helps to cause the inflation that has been ravaging Western economies . <P> Ironically , Commoner continues , if the nation really wanted to solve energy problems , it could . One way would be to match energy-demanding tasks to resources . Using fast electrified trains for journeys up to 500 miles should be encouraged , for example , because they use energy efficiently . But burning coal or oil in a power plant to heat homes electrically should be discouraged because 97% of the energy is wasted . Indeed , all heating and cooling of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually limitless and thus , at least in the long run , cheap . <P> So far , so good-even if Commoner does not spell out how the nation should go about financing such changes . But then he moves to a more demanding and shakier argument . All U.S. industry , he says , is caught in a trap . It keeps looking to new technologies to boost output and has to pay immense amounts of money for new machines . Since the money can not come from internal profits - which Commoner , at least , claims have dropped sharply - it has to come from banks and other investors who are already pinched for capital . Moreover , the new processes tend to use less human labor , spurring unemployment . " Energy links the two effects , " says Commoner , concluding that energy problems are a major cause of shortages of both capital and jobs .
