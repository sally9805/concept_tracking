Despite his penchant for secrecy , aliases and bulletproof cars , and his aversion to photographers and public appearances , his notoriety as a superspy has always made General Reinhard Gehlen a controversial figure . As head of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front during World War II , Gehlen so infuriated Hitler with his precise predictions of Soviet victories that der Fhrer ordered him sent to an insane asylum . Instead , he fled to the Bavarian Alps , and later made a deal with the invading Americans : 50 cases of secret data on the Red Army in return for U.S. financial and political backing for what became Bonn 's postwar espionage organization , the BND ( Bundesnachrichtendienst ) . An obsessive antiCommunist , Gehlen helped plot some of the crucial undercover moves of the cold war . But the shadowy chief of German intelligence was forced into retirement at the age of 66 in 1968 , partly because two of his aides were found to be Soviet double agents . Now Gehlen has again stirred up a controversy-this time with his forthcoming memoirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feared . The book is said to have brought $175,000 for its serialization , starting last week in the West German newspaper Die Welt , and over $500,000 has reportedly been bid by a group of book publishers led by the World Publishing Co. in New York . Gehlen claims to have known about the Berlin Wall before it went up , to have been aware of plans for the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia before it occurred , and to have correctly predicted the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 . Perhaps his most startling assertion is that missing Nazi War Criminal Martin Bormann was really a Soviet agent who died in the Soviet Union less than three years ago . <P> A more shadowy figure than Gehlen himself , Reichsleiter ( National Leader ) Bormann rose from an obscure fund raiser for the Nazi Party to become the second most powerful official of the Third Reich . The short , stocky Bormann was Secretary to the Fuhrer , Director of the Party Chancellery , and one of the most hated and feared men in Hitler 's Germany . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exercised virtual control over everyone Hitler saw and everything Hitler read . As executor of Hitler 's estate , he was the first to enter the room in the Fhrerbunker after Hitler 's suicide . Turning the government over to Grand Admiral Karl Dnitz , Bormann fled the bunker on the night of May 1 , 1945 , in an attempt to slip through the tightening Soviet ring of tanks and troops only 300 yards away . Somewhere between the bunker and Friedrichstrasse Station , Martin Bormann vanished . <P> Mountain Hideout . It is here that the mystery surrounding Bormann begins . At the 1945-46 Nuremberg trials , when Bormann was sentenced to death in absentia for his war crimes , two men claimed that he died on the night of May 1 before reaching the Friedrichstrasse Station . But his corpse was never found , and four weeks later his voice was reportedly heard over a secret radio station in Stockholm , triggering rumors that have not yet ceased .                   @ @
