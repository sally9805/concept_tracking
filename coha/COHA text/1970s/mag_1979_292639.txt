The Presidency <P> An anxious Cabinet officer was calling , and he asked to be put through immediately to President Lyndon B. Johnson , who was in conference and had left word with White House Phone Operator Mary Crowe Burns that he wanted all calls cut off . <P> Mary Burns considered the time of day , the people in the meeting , the state of the world and L.B.J. 's frame of mind and tone of voice when he had said , " No calls . " Then she put through the call . <P> When Johnson answered he rumbled , " Woman , do I have to send you a memo ? I said no calls . " Burns said she felt it was important that the caller talk with the President . Johnson accepted the call without further grumping . <P> That is only one of the thousands of memories that Burns has taken with her into retirement after 30 years as a White House switchboard operator , the last three as chief operator . Part technician , part diplomat and security officer , Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House nervous system . Without them , Presidents can be rendered blind and dumb . <P> When Caroline Kennedy lived at the White House , she picked up the phone one night and Burns heard this request : " I want to talk to Santa Claus . " Burns turned to a man in the telegraph room and asked for help . He got on the line with a jolly " Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! " and a report from the North Pole for the five-year-old Caroline . A few minutes after Caroline hung up , the President 's line was alight again . " Mary , " asked a startled John Kennedy , " how did you do that ? <P> When Burns first went to work under Truman , the world was in turmoil . Once she worked at her switchboard for 40 days without a break . But it was worth it when Truman called one night , feeling lonely . Bess was away . Margaret had sailed for Europe . " Get me Margie , " Truman ordered . Burns affirmed the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the President 's daughter was two days out to sea . Margaret Truman was raised on a ship-to-shore connection in ten minutes . When the conversation ended , the President rang Burns back . " No one has ever had such service , " he said . <P> Burns could gauge the intensity of presidential concern from her headset , but she kept it all to herself . The phones hummed with hushed anxiety during the Cuban missile crisis , kept secret for six days . The Kennedy assassination strained the White House switchboard more than any other single event . Calls came in from all over the world , but the lines were so busy that only a fraction got through . People would call in distress and just sob , " Get me the East Room , " which was where Kennedy 's body lay . <P> Crank calls have mounted over the years . Bums relishes the time a White House operator , caught in heavy telephone crossfire , hooked two crank calls together so the angry citizens could rail at each other . One man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Arthur Flemming and wanted to talk to the President . Mary sensed something was wrong . She stalled , got Arthur Flemming and learned the caller was an impostor.
