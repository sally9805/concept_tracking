The guerrillas accept a cease-fire and prepare for elections " <P> This is an important day for Rhodesia , " declared a jubilant Sir Ian Gilmour , Britain 's Deputy Foreign Secretary . " It means the end of the war . " So it seemed . Moments earlier , Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe , co-leaders of the Patriotic Front guerrilla alliance , had entered a gilded room in London 's Foreign Office to add their signatures to a twelve-page protocol that had already been initialed by representatives of Britain and the now defunct Salisbury government of Prime Minister Abel Muzorewa . The document : a three-sided agreement for a complete cease-fire in Zimbabwe Rhodesia 's increasingly bloody seven-year civil war . <P> The fruit of 15 weeks of painstaking negotiations at the stately Lancaster House in London , the accord carried with it the Front 's previous acceptance of a majority-rule constitution and parliamentary elections . It thus appeared to pave the way for the peaceful creation of an independent republic of Zimbabwe by early next spring , as the British plan envisages . More immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms within two weeks and for thousands of exiled guerrillas to return to Rhodesia , outlaws no longer . Declared a smiling Nkomo with some emotion : " We are going home . " For all the hopeful statements , however , even some British officials conceded that they remained skeptical about the long-term prospects for real peace . <P> The Patriotic Front 's acceptance of the cease-fire terms came at the eleventh hour . Two days earlier , in fact , the Lancaster House conference had formally ended with no comprehensive settlement . In the face of a stern ultimatum from British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington , who had conducted the talks , Nkomo and Mugabe had flatly rejected a British scheme by which the guerrillas would assemble at 15 widely dispersed camps , which they felt would be too isolated and vulnerable . Their agreement was extracted by a British concession in a numbers game . It gave the Front forces a 16th camp in the Rhodesian heartland and empowered the newly arrived British Governor , Lord Soames , to designate additional concentrations , if the guerrillas report in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate is 20,000 men ; the Front says it has some 35,000 . <P> The so-called frontline states ( Mozambique , Zambia , Angola , Tanzania and Botswana ) , whose support is crucial to the guerrillas , were given much of the credit for breaking the deadlock . Anxious for an end to the costly struggle , their leaders had been instrumental ever since they helped bring the Front to the conference table last September . With strong diplomatic encouragement from Whitehall and Washington , the frontline Presidents had sent a senior representative to London to tell the guerrilla leaders-particularly the recalcitrant Mugabe-that they must settle with the British . That arm twisting , and the additional assembly points , did the trick .
