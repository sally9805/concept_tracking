More than a third of the people in the world suffer from serious malnutrition . In 36 countries , income averages less than $265 per person per year ; in another 34 , less than $520 . <P> These figures from the World Bank point up the desperate poverty in many of the 100 nations that are euphemistically classified as less developed countries ( LDCs ) . People in the industrialized countries with pressing economic problems of their own might well say , " So what ? " Poverty has long been a fact of life , and Americans especially feel that they have done more than their share in giving foreign aid since World War II . It is not , however , a question of altruism . The advanced countries have an urgent self-interest in improving a situation that in a few years may well overshadow any other international issue . <P> The self-interest is partly political : poverty in the LDCs provides fertile soil for demagogues . So far this spring , there have been three political outbreaks : a Marxist coup in Afghanistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each has had special causes , but the potential will exist for many more such explosions until the 3 billion or so citizens of LDCs can see some prospect for improvement in their lives . A few years ago , a French author wrote a futuristic novel in which the world 's hungry banded together in a kind of vengeful crusade and descended on the industrialized world . One need not take that vision literally to recognize the seriousness of the threat . <P> Economic self-interest also should prompt the advanced nations to alleviate Third World poverty . It is simply not reasonable to think that the industrialized world can maintain , let alone expand , its economies in a kind of closed circle . It must bring in more and more of the rest of the globe , not only as suppliers of raw materials , but also as trading partners . <P> The economic conditions of the Third World , of course , are not uniform . The OPEC nations have become world financial powers , and a handful of once depressed countries , such as South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of LDCS have been knocked backward in the 1970s by a devastating one-two punch : oil price boosts that have raised the cost of running the most primitive factories and farm machines , and recession in the industrial world that has restricted markets for cotton , copper , cocoa , tin and other raw materials sold by less developed lands . In many countries of Asia and Africa , economic growth rates have dropped to around 2% a year - not enough to keep up with population expansion , which averages 2.6% for the LDCs . The poor countries have borrowed a staggering $200 billion , half of it since 1973 , to pay for imports of fuel and food . Yet despite a startling rise in food imports , from 20 billion tons in 1970 to 45 billion tons in 1975 , the average African , for example , had less to eat last year than he did in 1970.
