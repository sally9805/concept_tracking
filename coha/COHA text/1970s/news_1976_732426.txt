txt The next potential crisis date in the Middle East is only 11 weeks away . May 30 is the day when the mandate for the UN peace-keeping force on the Golan Heights expires . Virtually everybody involved is jockeying to try to influence what happens then . The danger , of course , is that if Syria or Israel refuses to concur in renewing the mandate of the UN force ? which acts as a buffer between Syrians and Israelis on Go-'Ian ? fighting might break out there again and escalate . into another Middle East war . ? ( Of Israel and Syria , Syria is likely to demand morefor agreeing to renewal of the mandate . ) What is being said and done about the Middle East these days in the United States , Israel , Egypt , Syria , and Jordan should be seen against the background of that May 30. deadline . To take the preceding list of countries in turn : United States . The Ford administration is committed to movement toward a Middle East settlement , even in this presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ford needs to get past May 30 without another major Middle East crisis on his hands . To this end , President Ford : ( 1 ) continues to . put quiet pressure on Israel to be flexible and corn-promising ; and ( 2 ) strives to show Egyptian President Sadat ( and the latter 's Arab critics ) that moderation and cooperation pay . This in turn explains : ( 1 ) Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's willingness , after his visit to Washington ? last month , to settle for " nonbelligerence " ? something less than a final , definitive peace ? from the Arabs in any renewed negotiating ; and ( 2 ) U.S. willingness to supply Egypt with six big transport aircraft ( probably with other military equipment later on , if Congress ? approves ) , with wheat , and with the economic aid announced by U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon in Cairo this week . // *Syria , Israel : deadline ahead // Israel : Israel 's need is to ensure that : ( 11 It is not forced or hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to get from the Arabs ; ( 2 ) It continues to get from the United States the military and economic aid deemed requisite for its survival ; ( 3 ) Its potential enemies ( such as Egypt ) do not get arms from the U.S. and tip the military balance against Israel ; and ( 4 ) It does not appear such a hard bargainer that the label " intransigent " sticks . " Against this background should be seen : ( 1 ) Israel 's cageyness about further withdrawal on Golan and the Palestinian issue ; ( 2 ) Israel 's hope that a Ford administration cut in its economic aid next year be restored and that it get U.S. Pershing missiles ; ( 3 ) Pro-Israel efforts . in the U.S. ( parallel with blunt statements by the Israeli Ambassador to the United States ) against U.S. plane and arms sales to Egypt ; and ( 4 ) Mr. Rabin 's flexibility on the " nonbelligerency " question . Egypt . President Sadat needs to : ( 1 ) Show that he has not lost his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with UN resolutions on the Israeli-Arab dispute ; and ( 2 ) Prove to other Arabs that his ' trust in the U.S. is justified . These needs have prompted him in recent weeks : to ( 1 ) Visit the oil-rich Gulf states to win support for his overall approach and gettheir aid to keep Egypt economically afloat ; ( 2 ) Sharpen his propaganda btattle with Syria , which since the last Sinai withdrawal agreement has scored some political points for itself at Egypt 's expense ; and ( 3 ) Nudge the U.S. into doing or giving more by publicly indicating that the U.S. has given him promises to live up to . Syria . President Assad of Syria , since the last Egyptian-Israeli withdrawal agreement , has enhanced his bargaining position in the Middle East by : ( 1 ) Appearing as the most zealous and effective Arab champion of the Palestinians at the UN ; ( 2 ) Emerging as the arbiter in getting a cease-fire and perhaps a settlement in Lebanon after nine months of intermittent civil war in that country ; ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the latter is moving toward a more active role as Syria 's ally in confrontation with Israel . ( Admittedly any one of these situations could still turn sour on Mr. Assad . ) . Jordan . King Hussein of Jordan , after being squeezed out as an active Middle East protagonist by the unanimous decision of the Rabat Arab summit of late 1974 , is coming out of the wings by association with Syrian President Assad . And at the end of this month , he will be seen again as a more active figure on the stage when he arrives in the United States for talks with President Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger .
