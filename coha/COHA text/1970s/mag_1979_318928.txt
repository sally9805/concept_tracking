Wealth in Washington <P> Their public salaries hardly compare with those in the top ranks of American private enterprise , but the nine mem bers of the U.S. Supreme Court , the President 's Cabinet , members of Congress and four announced candidates for the Republican presidential nomination are not quite ready to line up for food stamps . <P> Operating under the requirements of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act , official Washington and those who hope to become official Washington last week be gan disclosing their personal finances . Thousands more who will be required to report ( nearly 11,000 earn more than the $44,756 that makes them eligible ) took advantage of extensions granted by the Office of Government Ethics , set up to handle the disclosures . Among that group : President Carter and Vice President Mondale . <P> The disclosures were further delayed by a last-minute court order issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Collins in New Orleans after six federal judges argued that they feared kidnapings and other threats once their wealth was known . Despite that order , eight members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , who reported his net worth at $1.3 million when he was confirmed in 1971 , got a 30-day extension be cause of illness . <P> The richest member of the high court reporting last week was Justice Potter Stewart , who said he has assets of more than $1 million , not including the equity in his Washington home . <P> Chief Justice Warren Burger an nounced that his assets totaled between $600,000 and $730,000 and that he owes between $100,000 and $200,000 ( the law requires the reporting of only a range of wealth , not specific amounts ) . <P> Justice William Rehnquist reported savings of between $5,000 and $15,000 and property in Arizona . Justice Thurgood Marshall seems to be living on his $72,000 salary , reporting interest receipts of less than $1,000 from a savings account . <P> Richest of the Republican presidential candidates reporting last week ( Ronald Reagan and Phil Crane did not file ) was Lawyer John Connally . His 1978 income was $1.3 million . Nor were any of the other G.O.P. hopefuls in bad financial shape . George Bush said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches ; Howard Baker made $397,000 , including his $86,666 Senate salary . Robert Dole earned $115,244 . <P> As disclosures began pouring forth from Congress , it turned out that the Senate has 19 millionaires . Among them : Ted Kennedy , who reported an income of between $294,450 and $584,525 in addition to his Senate salary of $57,500 , plus oil royalties of up to $50,000 and real estate holdings of $1.5 million . <P> The apparent winner of the Senate sweepstakes was , however , Pennsylvania Republican Pickle Heir H. John Heinz III , who reported wealth of between $11.7 million and $20.9 million . That did not include income from two trusts valued at more than $5 million . Runner-up was Missouri Republican John Danforth , who said his assets actually declined last year because the family business , the Ralston Purina Co. , suffered a dip in profits . Danforth said his current holdings amount to between $6.9 million and $17.2 million . Other millionaire Senators include : <P> &gt; California Republican S.I . Hayakawa , who reported assets of between $250,000 and $1.5 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
