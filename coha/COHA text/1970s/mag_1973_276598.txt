Shocked , Titillated and Disgusted <P> Sir / Your cover story on Last Tango Jan. 22 terrified me . A society that spends so much time thinking about , filming and writing about sex obviously does not have much else it considers important enough to occupy it . <P> We are now nearly ready for the takeover , from wherever it may come . We have not the mental vigor left to resist , and someone will walk off with the house while we are preoccupied in the bedroom . <P> THOMAS S. LOEBER Coos Bay , Ore . <P> Sir / I recognize that you are not responsible for the fact that Last Tango was produced , and that as a modern , sophisticated and wide-ranging magazine you can not ignore it . But you certainly are responsible for giving it such supremely prominent , sickeningly detailed coverage . <P> What image of life is this to present to our children and young people ? True , they will not be allowed to see the film , but with your graphic reporting they will have no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANGAN Arlington , Va . <P> Sir / Has TIME gone mad ? <P> BLANCHE DERR Bellerose , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir / Since you have stooped to pimping for B-rated peep-show-type movies , this is my last tango with TIME . <P> <P> JOHN F.

RAAB Bayonne , N.J. <P> <P> Sir / Those of us who are awaiting the reformation must be grateful to Marlon Brando and Director Bertolucci . <P> Only after respectable folk embrace the excesses of an era can a return to decency begin . <P> <P> VIRGINIA FREAS Richland , Mich . <P> Sir / Your taste and self-esteem as a publication are apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . And do n't tell us we 're not qualified to judge artistic film . <P> We 're so sophisticated that we always know when we 're about to throw up . <P> <P> SHIRLEY AND BOWDEN ATHERTON Galveston , Texas <P> Sir / Where have all the flowers gone ? <P> They have wilted into a stinking pile of compost nurtured by irresponsibility , disrespect , laziness , greed and moral decay , exemplified by TIME 's feature story on Last Tango . <P> <P> EDWARD WALKER N. Syracuse , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir / I know there will be thousands of moviegoers standing in endless lines up to their hips in lascivious drool to see Last Tango , but please use the space in your magazine for better fare than degenerate films . Where will our younger generation find some older group to admire ? Standing in line to watch Last Tango ? <P> <P> MRS . R.W.
