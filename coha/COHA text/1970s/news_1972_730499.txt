She said she planned to vote for because the Republicans got caught snooping in the Democrat national headquarters in the Watergate Hotel . Campus Issues Debated Rather than debate about upcoming elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about issues on their campus . Two major ones are the banning of advertising about term paper research services in the student newspaper and a surplus of dogs on the campus . Last year William Kolb , the college provost , cracked down on the term paper research service ads because he and the college faculty believed mention of the services encouraged cheating among college students . In September David Kramansky , the new editor of the newspaper the Round Table , ignored the administration 's orders and printed an ad for one of the firms which do research and write papers for students at prices of $2 to $3 a page . The fledgling editor was promptly called on the carpet and instructed not to print anymore of the ads . Harold Grutzmacher , dean of students , said information about the services could cause Beloit students to be taken advantage of and could injure their academic careers .

After the college threatened to revoke a $5,200 annual subsidy from the paper , Kramansky promised to temporary abstain from mention of the services . But he predicts that the paper may again print the ad . " The paper needs the revenue from the advertising , he said , " and I object tothe'attrainistra ... -= tion telling students what to print in the student newspaper . " Altho Kramansky 's fellow students are sympathetic with his feud with the college administration , they are hesitant to get involved in the controversy . Bill Starkhouse , a junior economics major , who said the administration is gunning for the paper , laughed at the idea that a student could lack the imagination to use shortcuts which collegians have been using for years to outwit professors . Dog Policy Furor Beloit students also criticized administrators for eliminating a policy which permitted dogs in student rooms . The . plan did not work , administrators said , because the dog population on Campus sivelled. and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the campus clean . " Howling dogs were everywhere , " said one college official . Much to the students ' dismay , several dozen canines were rounded up by dog catcher 's and taken to the city dog pound . ? " What 's funny , " said , the official , 9s that no. one . bothered to claim dogs in the pound . '
