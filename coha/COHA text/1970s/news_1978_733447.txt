txt and Richard Phillips NEARLY 150,000 commuters were seeking alternate routes to downtown Chicago Thursday after large cracks found in a Chicago Transit Authority elevated structure caused service to be curtailed on the CTA 's Ryan line and 1,1nnte Tolnytri lincy CTA engineers estimated that it will take two days to make repairs and restore normal service on both the CTA and the Rock Island lines . Neither the CTA nor the Rock Island can operate in the area until repairs are complete . Commuters reported mass confusion Wednesday night as thousands of passsengers who normally ride the Ryan line or the Rock Island struggled with the problem of getting home . The cracks were in three large 10-year-old girders supporting Ryan line tracks as they pass over the Rock Island right-of-way near 18th and Clark streets south of the Loop . ONE ROCK ISLAND official who examined the three cracks in the CTA girders said they were so large that the entire structure could have crashed 40 feet to the ground if one more CTA train had passed over it . Yet the first crack in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rock Island as he rode under the CTA structure aboard a commuter train . The engineer , Hernan Solarte , 46 , a 21-year veteran with the Rock Island , immediately phoned Patrick McCarthy , a friend and the supervisor of track and structures for the CTA . McCarthy rushed inspectors to the scene where they discovered two other cracks .. The CTA shut down service over the structure at 10:21 a.m. and the Rock Island halted service at 11:43 a.m . THE ORIGINAL report estimated that the first crack was three-fourths of an inch wide . Inspectors said that by the time they arrived it was twice that . Soon a second crack in another girder was spotted . As engineers looked up to examine it , a third crack was seen developing in yet another girder . The structure , built in 1968 and opened for service in September , 1969 , is one of the newest elevated spans in the CTA system . Officials said privately that similar problems have not developed in other CTA elevated structures , even though some are more than 80 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park line , built in 1893 to carry visitors to the Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park . The Loop elevated was built in 1896 . JAMES ARNOLD , Chicago purchasing agent , said the contractor who did the work where the cracks occurred is E. J. Albrecht Co .. 2626 W. 26th St. The Chicago Department of Public Works was in charge of the project . Milton Pikarsky , then commissioner of public works and ' now chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority , said the consultant for the project was DeLeuw Cattier , 16 . W. Wacker Dr. Both Albrecht and DeLeuw Cather have done much additional work for various Chicago area government agencies . A spokesman for the Albrecht firm said he received many calls from reporters concerning the cracks in the girders , but " no one from the city has notified us officially . " Thomas Wolgemuth , CTA manager of engineering , said he had no idea what caused the cracks . He discounted the weather as the cause and also said it is too soon for normal metal fatigue to be . responsible . HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years but he did not know the date of // CRACKED STEEL GIRDERS Tribune Man Girders crack , Ryan L ' halted // the last inspection of the cracked girders . Pikarsky , an engineer , said the fact that the cracks appeared under a curve may be to blame since the stresses on curves are different from those on straightaways . " Curves present different stresses and also the force of trains braking as they go around curves is different , " Pikarsky said . " The problem may be related to unusual and unanticipated stresses because of the curve . " The cracks occurred in the area where the Ryan line tracks turn east from the Ryan Expressway median strip at about lath Street and Wentworth Avenue to join the elevated tracks near Wabash Avenue . TILE SUPPORTS THAT cracked are made of steel 2 inches thick formed into hollow 3-foot by 3-foot square " box " girders that extend under the CTA tracks . The three cracked girders support about 130 feet of CTA tracks . Cracks could be seen on three sides of each girder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fourth side , which can not be seen because it is under the tracks . The girders rest on top of support pillars rising from ground level . The girders support stringer beams that run parallel to and beneath the tracks . On top of the stringer beams is a concrete shell that holds the gravel in which the ties of the tracks are buried . Wolgemuth said that , to shore up the structure , the CTA will erect 24 steel beams grouped into six support columns of four beams each . Cross beams will be installed between the support beams to take the place of the cracked girders in holding up the CTA tracks . BOTH the CTA and the City of Chicago will join in this emergency work . Once the support structures are in place , extensive studies will be made to determine the cause of the cracks and how to prevent additional cracking . Then permanent replacements will be installed . An expert on railroad bridge structures just happened to look out the window of the Rock Island commuter train he was riding to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CTA bridge overhead . His call to CTA officials brought traffic to a halt on both the CTA Dan Ryan line and the Rock Island commuter operations . By Wednesday afternoon , repair crews were on the scene near 18th and Clark streets ( left ) to begin round-the-clock efforts to open the span by Friday . At right , a Rock Island train moves through the area as crews prepare to raise support systems to fix the cracks in three beams . One Rock Island official who examined the inch-and-a-half wide cracks estimated the entire structure could have fallen 40 feet to the ground if one more CTA train had passed over the bridge .
