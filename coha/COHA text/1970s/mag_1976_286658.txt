When several hundred soldiers were stricken with influenza at Fort Dix , N.J. , in February , doctors at first were not greatly alarmed . The recruits appeared to be suffering only from the A/Victoria influenza virus , a strain that caused last winter 's relatively mild flu epidemic . But tests showed that at least a dozen of the soldiers-including an 18-year-old who died of flu-related pneumonia-had been infected with a new and more worrisome viral strain . Medical experts are concerned that the virus , usually seen only in swine , may be similar to the lethal virus that probably caused some 20 million deaths-including 548,000 in the U.S.-during the great global flu " pandemic " of 1918-19 . <P> Last week , after two White House meetings with top health authorities , President Ford took an extraordinary step to avert any repetition of that disaster . He called for the inoculation of the entire U.S. population-a program that would exceed even the record-breaking 100 million oral doses of polio vaccine given during a year and a half in the early ' 60s-and asked Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of a new vaccine that is effective against the swine virus , if indeed it reappears in epidemic proportions . To supply enough shots for every American by early next winter-before the onset of the new flu season-drug companies will have to mobilize almost immediately , ordering , among other things , millions of fertilized eggs in which the vaccine will have to be grown . <P> Ford insisted that there was " no cause for alarm , " but added that " we can not afford to take a chance with the health of this country . " Experts agreed , pointing out that whenever an entirely new flu strain has appeared ( as opposed to a minor variant like A/Victoria ) , it has been followed by a massive outbreak the following season . When that happens , the death toll can be high , even in an era of antibiotics ( to fight bacterial-linked infections ) and other forms of treatment unavailable in 1918-19 . During the most recent pandemic in 1968-69 , for example , about 28,000 Americans died and $3.2 billion was lost in medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail some risks . The new vaccine will not be effective against other known flu strains . Also , some Americans could develop strong allergic reactions to the egg-grown vaccine . But for the overwhelming majority , the only aftereffect of the shots will be nothing more than a sore arm- " a small price to pay , " says Ford , " for this vital protection . "
