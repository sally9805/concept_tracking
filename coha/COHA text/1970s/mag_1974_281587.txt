For once , as they gathered last week to inaugurate the United Nations General Assembly 's 29th session , the delegates had little difficulty sorting out and settling on priorities . In his annual report , Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim described the world 's economic situation as " a global crisis of extraordinary dimensions . " Incoming General Assembly President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria said that " the problems of development are spreading beyond national and continental limits . " President Gerald Ford , appearing to deliver " the first of my addresses to the representatives of the world , " agreed that " the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress . " <P> Uncommonly Blunt . In his first formal venture into international diplomacy , Ford offered the delegates the same thing he had given the American people in his Inaugural Address , " a little straight talk among friends . " The delegates who heard him agreed afterward that the President had been uncommonly blunt . " Developing and developed countries , market and nonmarket economies-we are all part of one interdependent economic system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some countries-namely the oil-producing nations - appeared to be acting less interdependently than they had a right to . <P> The President linked two pressing world supply crises , oil and food . Problems in either could " be resolved on the basis of cooperation-or can , I should say , be made unmanageable on the basis of confrontation . " Ford deplored the use of oil as a political weapon , as Arab countries had employed it last year . " To use one commodity for political purposes , " he cautioned , " will inevitably tempt other countries to use their commodities for their own purposes . " <P> Ford pointed out that the U.S. is the world 's leading food producer . " It has not , " he said , " been our policy to use food as a political weapon despite the oil embargo and recent oil price and production decisions . " Any implicit threat in that statement was softened by Ford 's announcement that , despite inflated prices , the U.S. would increase food aid to developing nations . He did not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , Treasury Secretary William E. Simon was warning Congress that because of the impact of high oil prices , " we may be forced to reassess certain aspects of our policy as well as develop new policies that will increase our leverage . " <P> Actually , the U.S. has relatively limited economic clout against the oil-producing nations , as Ford well knows . The oil countries depend on the U.S. for wheat , corn and tobacco generally , but they could get these from alternate sources . They do buy American petroleum-industry equipment , but for the U.S. to embargo such exports would be self-defeating . If the U.S. held back on sales of armaments or commercial aircraft , two major export items , the Arabs could easily find substitutes elsewhere , albeit of lower quality in many cases . The most compelling U.S. argument is actually an appeal to Arab self-interest : a worldwide depression caused by unstable energy prices could hurt oil producers as much as oil customers .                   @ @
