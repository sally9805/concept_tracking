Senator Kennedy is the author of In Critical Condition : The Crisis in America 's Health Care , recently published by Simon and Schuster . When David stood before Goliath , - he had no time for opinion polls or the fears of fainthearted compatriots on the sidelines ; the same is true this year of George McGovern as he stands before President Nixon in the battle for the White House . The Senator from South Dakota has armed himself with the only weapons that are necessary to win the battle on November ' 7 ? a record of integrity and compassion for every citizen , answers for every issue , and faith in the rightness of his cause . The stakes are high in this election year , and they are high because people are fed up  --  fed up with a war that will not end ; fed up with jobs that ca n't be found ; fed up with tax loopholes that ca n't be closed ; fed up with streets that ca n't be safe ; fed up with leadership that can not lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . That 's why many of the questions we are asking this year are the same ones that President Kennedy asked in 1960 , that Robert Kennedy asked in 1968 , and that George McGovern is asking in 1972 . What kind of leadership do we want for our cities and our states , our nation and the world ? To countless men and women I have met across the country in recent weeks , the answer to that question is clear . Measured against the high standards of the past , our aspirations are no longer being met . We search for peace and all we find is war . We search for equal justice and all we find is special privilege . We search for excellence , and all we find is mediocrity . We need a President who can inspire the country , bring back the vision and commitment we used to have , and give us the courage to meet our challenges on all the issues that matter deeply to the people . It 's all very well for the President to visit the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens he leaves behind him here at home ? The first great challenge we face in 1972 is the challenge to deal effectively with the vital issues that confront us . But that 's not the only challenge . The challenge in this election year goes beyond any single substantive issue . It goes beyond war and peace , or inflation and unemployment , or health and education , or crime and drug control . The challenge is also one that asks whether we want government for the many , or government for the few , whether we want leaders who serve all the people , or only the special interests . In addition , it is a challenge that asks us whether we want a government that is open and candid with the people , or one that is closed and cloaked with secrecy to keep the people out . Finally , it is a challenge that goes to the very heart of honesty and integrity in our government , its freedom from corruption . Every day , George McGovern is talking about these challenges . Every day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to vote against Richard Nixon  --  twenty-five reasons to vote against the re-election of the President , and the list has only just begun : ( 1 ) Vietnam . As Mr. Nixon told us in 1968 , " Those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace should not be given another chance . " We want a President who will keep his promise to end the war and bring the prisoners back . We want a President who will stop spending tens of billions of our nation 's precious dollars on Saigon and Indochina , and start spending them on all our states and cities here at home . ( 2 ) Prices . Every time a housewife buys a pound of meat in any supermarket in the country , she pays the hidden tax of rising prices . Why should the profits of the nation 's largest corporations be going through the roof , when the wages of the ordinary citizen are locked in Phase 2 's cellar ? ( 3 ) Jobs . Two million more Americans have lost their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , thanks to the recession Mr. Nixon gave us . We want an administration that will provide , jobs for all who want them , instead of blaming unemployment on the women of America , on veterans returning from Vietnam , and on college students and other young Americans entering the labor market . ( 4 ) Devaluation of the Dollar . For a generation , spanning World War II , the Korean War and most of the Vietnamese War , the dollar held its own in all the markets of the world . Then , in 1971 , in the wake of the Administration 's disastrous trade and economic policies , the dollar fell apart and had to be devalued , a tragic symbol of America 's fallen prestige throughout the world . ( 5 ) Taxes . We 've had four years of new tax breaks for big business and opposition to every decent tax reform that Congress tries to pass . Our present laws are nothing but a giant sieve , full of loopholes worth billions of dollars in special benefits to the special interests every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest welfare bill , but it 's the sort of welfare that only Alice in Wonderland can understand , because the greatest benefits go to the richest individuals and largest corporations . And do n't forget , there 's a national sales tax in your future , if Mr. Nixon is re-elected . ( 6 ) Cities . The cities are in crisis , yet the Administration ignores them because they are not burning . The President is willing to waste billions on defense and foreign military aid , but he vetoes millions for housing in the inner cities and impounds a billion more in funds that Congress made available for urban need . ( 7 ) The Vice President . The new image they 're trying to unveil this year is so transparently the same Vice President we 've had before that no one is being fooled . The Vice President is an issue this year , because Sargent Shriver has made him one . As Mr. Shriver put it in hisacceptance speech , " I am not embarrassed to be George McGovern 's seventh choice for Vice President  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiro Agnew . " ( 8 ) Southern Strategy . Sooner or later , people will see that this strategy is nothing more than Reconstruction warmed over , a cynical device to keep the South preoccupied with race and bussing to the exclusion of basic goals in areas like homes , schools , jobs and health . ( 9a ) Haynsworth . The President forgot that Congress cares about the integrity of the Supreme Court and its freedom from suspicion in areas like conflict of financial interest . ( 9b ) Carswell . The President compounded the felony by forgetting that Congress cares about the caliber of Supreme Court Justices and their dedication to the principle of equal rights for every citizen . ( 10 ) Welfare . When the President 's Family Assistance plan was launched in 1969 , it became the domestic high-water mark of the Administration . Since then , we 've seen three years of apathy , , retreat and outright encouragement of Republican efforts to scuttle it in Congress  --  a perfect example of the Administration 's monumental rhetoric and minuscule performance . What right does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , when the President 's own economic policies have added 6 million people to the welfare rolls across the nation since 1968 ? ( 11 ) Social Security and the Elderly . Over the past four years , we have had constant opposition from the Administration to every bill we tried to pass in Congress to help the nation 's 20 million senior citizens , especially in areas like food and health and jobs . In the latest sorry chapter , the Administration fought tooth and nail against the 20 per cent increase in Social Security benefits that Congress passed last June . Now , as the checks go out to millions of the nation 's elderly before Election Day , the Administration has the nerve to enclose a slip claiming credit for the work that Congress did alone . Whatever became of Truth in Packaging ? ( 12 ) 18-year-old Vote . As with Social Security , the Administration fought against the reduction of the voting age by Congress in 1970 . Now , the White House is cynically trying to claim some credit for expansion of the franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these two issues , and young and old alike know how to cast their votes . ( 13 ) Human Rights . You have to go back to the era of Reconstruction to find a comparable abdication by a national administration of its responsibility for civil rights . And it 's not just- black Americans who bear the brunt of such neglect . It 's millions of Mexican-Americans , millions of Indians , millions of Italians , Jews and Irish , and countless others who want a government that cares about their needs and rights . ( 14 ) Education . The four-year record of vetoes and constant underfunding of major federal programs is eloquent testimony to the Administration 's disregard for the nation 's schools and colleges . Perhaps , they say , if they can raise enough dust over bussing , the clouds will hide the crisis in our classrooms . ( 15 ) Health . We have a health-care crisis because the Administration cares more about the health of the private insurance industry and the AMA than about the health of 200 million citizens . They call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership we see is the partnership with the special interests and big campaign contributors . ( 16 ) Vetoes . Call the roll of Nixon vetoes , and you see the programs at the bottom of the Administration 's barrel  --  health , hospitals , education , housing , TV campaign spending , jobs , family doctors , public works , child care , public broadcasting , railroad retirement benefits , and health and education yet again . Twelve consecutive vetoes of domestic social programs and reforms . Not since the Supreme Court 's Nine Old Men tried to hobble Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal in the 1930s has there been such wholesale opposition to the nation 's basic needs . ( 17 ) The Fort Worth Five . No case better symbolizes the quality of Nixon justice and the Administration 's dismal record on civil liberties than the harsh and vindictive imprisonment , for twelve long weeks , of five Irish-Americans from New York in the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth , Tex . Finally , thanks to the courage and perseverance of the prisoners and their attorneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful country , you say , when the nation 's highest Court can reach into a place like the Tarrant County Jail and touch the victims of injustice , men unable on their own to resist the powerful forces that oppress them ? But what sort of country is it where the Supreme Court is required to take such action to protect the people ? ( 18 ) Worker Health and Safety . Congress passed a law in 1970 to protect workers on the job , but the Administration refuses to give it the effective enforcement it deserves . Why should we have an administration that cares more about the welfare of Lockheed and Penn Central thari it does about the well-being of working men and women ? Why should we have an administration that can put 30,000 men in Asia to protect President Thiel. ' and his regime in South Vietnam , but somehow ca n't put 4,000 inspectors in our nation 's plants and factories to protect workers on the job ? ( 19 ) Postal Rate Increase . The ink was hardly dry on the Postal Reorganization Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postal Service imposed exorbitant new rate increases on thousands of the nation 's magazines and other publications . Nothing better illustrates the , Administration 's contempt for a free and robust press than its participation in this death sentence for many journals that ought to have a protected place in our society under the First Amendment . ( 20 ) Crime . That 's another broken promise we , recall from 1968 , the promise to bring back law and order . We know the dismal record of achievement , the soaring rate of crime , the shootings of policemen , the fear on urban streets . Congress passed a law in 1968 ? the Safe Streets Act  --  to try to meet the problem . But all we ever got was a maze of inefficiency and incompetence and corruption from the Justice Department in trying to implement the program . The slaying of Wolfgang Friedmann on the sidewalks of New York is a tragic symbol of the rising rate of crime in every major city in the nation . That 's the cruelest single irony , of this Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end the war in Asia and begin the war on crime . Four years later , we 're still at war in Asia and we have n't yet begun the war on crime . ( 21 ) Guns . We have a crisis over gun control , because the Administration is less concerned about people 's lives than it is about the campaign dollars the National Rifle Association can contribute and the votes the gun nuts can deliver . ( 22 ) Farmers . Agriculture is still America 's largest industry , yet the farmers of the nation have now endured four long years of neglect and rising costs and giant corporations taking over family farms . And all they see is fancy " Salutes to Agriculture " at the White House for farmers who are rich . Why does n't the Administration start paying farmers for their products , instead of simply praising them for their productivity ? The Russian wheat deal is only the latest sellout . They said it was just coincidence , when the big grain exporters made all , those windfall profits after getting telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't call that coincidence . I call that corruption . ( 23 ) ITT . This , case says it all . The doors of the White House are open wide to every chairman of the board , but they 're bolted tight against the average citizen . They said it was just coincidence , when ITT gave $400 , - 000 for the GOP convention this year , at the very time when a major antitrust case was pending and settled favorably . I do n't call that coincidence . I call that corruption . ( 24 ) Secret Campaign Funds . What about the $10 million slush fund for the President 's campaign ? When General Eisenhower was in charge in 1952 , Mr. Nixon almost lost ' his place on the party 's ticket because of an $18,000 secret fund . How can the President expect to keep his place in the White House now , with a $10 million secret fund ? They said is was just coincidence when ' hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions poured in from the dairy lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised . I do n't call that coincidence . I call that corruption . ( 25 ) Watergate . Last but not least , why does n't the President listen to the American people in public , instead of trying to eavesdrop on the Democratic Party in private ? They said it was just coincidence that the burglars at the Watergate were also on the payroll of the President 's campaign committee . I do n't call that coincidence . I call that corruption . That 's the way it is on every other issue . Time and again , the Administration has betrayed the public trust . It has thumbed its nose at the interests of the people . It has denied the basic rights protected by our Constitution . Day after day , I 've sat in the hearing rooms of Congress and in the Senate chamber . I 've heard the Administration try to defend itself against the incompetence and outright scandals that keep floating to the surface . I wish that every citizen could have spent a day with us in Washington over the past four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlines , but it 's worse when you 're there in person . That 's why 1972 is so important . If citizens are concerned about the issues , concerned about the power of the special interests , concerned about the veil of secrecy in our government , and , above all , concerned about corruption , they 'll send George McGovern to the White House to begin the fight for all the people , and they 'll send President Nixon back to his Wall Street law firm to continue the fight for the private interests he 's served so well in public office . ?
