Miami . Sunday , Jan. 18 , 1976 . Time is running out at the Super Bowl as the Pittsburgh Steelers are plodding down the field . They have controlled the ball for eleven straight minutes and have slogged to the Dallas Cowboy 18-yd. line . Franco Harris rams off tackle yet again for two more yards , and Coach Chuck Noll sends in Kicker Roy Gerela . His field goal gives the Steelers victory-3-2 . There is total silence in the Orange Bowl . Everyone is sound asleep . <P> <P> The championship game of professional football annually produces more ennui than excitement . " Ball control " is the Super Bowl battle cry . Stay on the ground , eat up the clock , kick a couple of field goals , and take home the trophy . Super Bowl X may be more of the same monotonous brand of play . Dallas has a stifling defense-as both the Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams found out in the playoffs . Pittsburgh ( TIME cover , Dec. 8 ) merely has the best defense in the N.F.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a zany offense that could turn the game into a wild , crowd-pleasing Shootout . Says Cowboys Assistant Coach Mike Ditka : " We have a chance to make the Super Bowl do for football what last fall 's World Series did for baseball . " <P> Old Standby . Quarterback Roger Staubach , who is having his best season , must be counted on for much of the drama . Staubach , 33 , completed 57% of his passes and scrambled for 316 yds . He has been better in the playoffs . His bomb to Wide Receiver Drew Pearson beat the Vikings in the final minute , and he buried the Rams with four touchdown passes . Staubach 's infantry consists of Running Backs Robert Newhouse and Preston Pearson . Neither is O.J. Simpson , but both ran effectively enough to make Dallas the top rushing team in their conference . <P> Staubach 's talent is throwing from the shotgun-the old football stand-by that Coach Tom Landry has adapted for third-down passing plays . Staubach sets up 5 yds. behind scrimmage , backpedals seven more after the snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says that the tactic allows him " to save a crucial couple tenths of a second " - time enough to read the defense , then choose one from a confusing mixture of possible passes in front of or behind opposing linebackers . <P> The shotgun is only one aspect of probably the most involved pro offense today . Dallas always changes its formation before the snap of the ball . Says Landry : " Most defenses are geared to recognition . If we can make the other team unsure of the play for a few seconds , we can hit our point of attack . " Getting there is never simple . Notes Preston Pearson : " When I was playing for Baltimore and Pittsburgh , the quarterback 's call in the huddle was a sentence long . Here it 's a paragraph . " <P> Diversity has made the season for Landry 's team . The play-offs seemed out of reach with the loss of starters like Calvin Hill and Bob Lilly . Landry , 51 , a coach who says , " Defense is part of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to enjoy it , and was even seen smiling on the sidelines .
