A genuinely funny ballet is as rare as , well , a genuinely funny Broadway comedy these days . Choreographing humor , in fact , requires someone with the quirky genius of Jerome Robbins , whose seldom seen 1956 comic gem , The Concert , has just been auspiciously revived by the New York City Ballet . Completely restaged and updated by Robbins , it is still a hilarious , crowd-pleasing delight , especially for anyone who has ever suffered through a Swan Lake mangled by an underrehearsed road company . <P> As the title suggests , The Concert starts at a recital . A mop-haired pianist stalks imperiously across the stage to his waiting instrument , elaborately dusts off the keyboard and then sails into some Chopin pieces . As he plunks away , an audience arrives : a pair of whispering ladies with jangly handbags , a bored cigar chomper and his prissy wife , an ecstatic temptress so caught up in the music that she seems to be seducing the piano . The sequence ends in a parody of musical chairs when an usher discovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it goes , in a series of dancing blackouts that range from satire to slapstick . Thanks to the precise timing of the City Ballet soloists , the intricate sight gags work to perfection . In an otherwise delicate sextet , one or another of six girls is either out of place , out of step or out of line . A lyrically complicated double duet turns into a Lao-coon-11ke tangle . <P> When the pianist strikes up the " Butterfly " Etude , the performers appear with wings and antennae . A girl twirls daintily forward through two converging rows of dancers ; when the lines part , there she lies-splat-on the stage floor . The pianist , his repertoire and his patience exhausted , suddenly grabs a huge butterfly net and chases the creatures offstage . <P> Robbins ' more recent masterpieces , The Goldberg Variations and Dances at a Gathering , the latter also set , incidentally , to Chopin piano pieces , conclusively proved that he is the best of all American-born choreographers . The revival of The Concert shows that he is ballet 's daftest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
