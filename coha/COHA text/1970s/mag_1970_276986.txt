On Wall Street these days , an eight-year-old book-Six Crises , by Richard Nixon-is attracting many new readers . The part that fascinates them is a description of Dr. Arthur Burns ' warning to Nixon in March 1960 that unless money was made easier , a recession could set in and cost him the presidency . Nixon wrote : " Burns ' conclusion was that unless some decisive governmental action was taken , and taken soon , we were heading for another economic dip which would hit its low point in October , just before the elections . " <P> Nixon realizes that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it . Plainly , he has begun to fear the dangerous economic consequences of recession . He and several major aides lately have sounded as if they were trying to raise expectations-and public pressure-for easier money , and simultaneously to use the jawbone to slay the stock market 's bears . <P> Two weeks ago Nixon expressed hope that " the time is coming " when credit restraint can be relaxed . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve Board , the President turned a round of applause for Burns to his purpose : " You see , Dr. Burns , that is a standing vote of appreciation in advance for lower interest rates and more money . " However , at week 's end Burns appeared before the House Banking and Currency Committee and gave no further hint of any impending credit relaxation . Even so , his deftness in fielding the questions so impressed Chairman Wright Patman , an old-time foe of the Fed , that the Texan told Burns . " You fell on your feet like a cat every time . " Earlier in the week , Treasury Secretary David Kennedy had predicted that lower rates " may be closer at hand than most people realize . " Then Paul McCracken , the President 's chief economist , swung the jawbone . In a speech at Yale , he refused to predict when money would become easier , but said that he saw reason " for a modest amount of optimism and hope . " <P> Covering His Risks . All those words had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices to close higher for the first time in a week and a half . The next day the Dow-Jones industrial average fell again until early afternoon ; then it overreacted to Kennedy 's words by jumping more than 14 points in half an hour . But the extreme euphoria soon wore off , and stocks seesawed inconclusively , closing at 753 on the Dow-Jones , nine points higher than the previous week . <P> Wall Streeters parochially felt that the Administration 's encouraging words were calculated to alleviate the stock market 's phthisis . While they were not entirely wrong , Nixon was thinking of much more . His political advisers view inflationary recession as the riskiest ballot-box issue of the year and the President is trying to cover his losses-just in case . He has continually said that he foresees no recession . But he sent a delicately balanced budget to Congress and warned that the Democrats had better not take chances by upsetting it . In addition , he started jawboning for easier money . If a real recession does hit , Nixon has his scapegoats ready : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
