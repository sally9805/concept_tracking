Being blind , he could not see that there were men just outside his door trying to get in at him . " I went over to see what was going Close-up With Anne Keegan on , " says the Rev. Hubert Lalan , 77 , whom everyone In the neighborhood called " Lester . " " And that 's when I sensed there was somebody there .

" They came in yelling at me , " says the Rev. Mr. Lalan , who for years supported himself as a piano tuner , until his paying customers ran out . " They beat me and knocked me down , and once they got me down they went in ( or Harriet . " I heard Harriet cry out .

" Someone in the neighborhood saw three men around the old people 's house ? a gray-shingled modest house at 11022 S. Vincennes Ave . ? and the only house in the block still occupied by whites . The neighbor called the police . " I do n't know what they were looking for , " says the Rev. Mr. Lalan . " It hopped so fast ? they just heat us and then the police came rushing in . " POLICE SAY TIIAT WIIEN they arrived in the house , the Rev. Mr. Lalan , his head covered with blood , was strug ? gling toward the phone , trying to call for help . He cowered back when he heard more footsteps and men shouting , for he could not see their uniforms . Once he was convinced the men were police officers , the Rev.

" Why , that dear man would come over once in a while and knock on our door and invite us over for a little open house for the neighbors , " says Lucy Green , who lives down the street . " He was blind but he was beautiful . He got around just fine . I used to see him on Sundays , in fact , hitchhiking to church  --  sticking but his white cane and getting a tide so he could save the carfare and give the money instead to his church .

He was always a religious man and said the good Lord was watching over him . " He was always proud of his little house and the fact that he was the only white who stayed on when the neighborhood changed . He said he loved his neighbors and they loved him back , so nothing could happen to him . I do n't think even this terrible , terrible thing will change him . " The old man sat in his easy chair Sunday , putting cold packs on his swollen head but never admitting that it hurt . The only pain he showed was when he talked of Harriet , cut and beaten up , lying injured at Little Company of Mary Hospital . When he spoke of " Harriet , " he 'd stop and choke up , and wipe away the tears that ran from his bruised and banged-up eyes . " Harriet and I  --  we always did everything together , " he said .
