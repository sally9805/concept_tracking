THE JOHN COLLIER READER by JOHN COLLIER 571 pages . Knopf. $10 . <P> <P> Among the reasons that the shuddery miniatures of British short-storyist John Collier are so satisfactory is that his fine talent is given direction by an equally splendid gift of malice . He does not much like man and his works , and is even less fond of woman and hers . He also has a deep and evident distaste for the dreary stuff that silts up lives and is called Reality . Collier 's fictional method is to spit neatly into Reality 's eye , and then watch mockingly as Reality fishes for its soiled handkerchief . To the reader , the spectacle can seem wondrously funny . <P> One of Collier 's themes is Beating the Game . In his Season of Mists , a rotter named Bert goes girl hunting at a seaside resort . His manner is sleazy , his person shopworn , and in August , as he knows , he would not have stood much chance . But it is November , the bitter end of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less , which is to say for Bert . He worms his way to the good side of a gorgeous and lonely barmaid named Bella , only to find that she has an identical twin named Nellie . How to capitalize on this embarrassment of wenches ? Bert invents his own identical twin , Fred , who shares the special job with him and thus can only appear when he , Bert , is at work . He marries both barmaids , and then achieves quadruple bliss byas Fred-seducing Bert 's wife , and-as Bert-reversing the outrage . But now , he realizes , he is doubly cuckolded ( by himself , but never mind ) . This is intolerable , so he leaves separate notes in which Fred and Bert threaten to drown each other . He makes it appear that their bodies have been lost at sea , after which , he reports , " there was just time to get the train for B- , and it was there that I met Mrs. Wilkinson . " <P> Another recurrent Collier theme is Not Quite Beating the Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner of two bottles , one containing a clever genie and the other imprisoning the most beautiful girl in the world . Frank uses the genie and enjoys the girl , who is also loving and compliant , but he is disquieted when he notices that whenever the girl emerges from the bottle , she wears a look of heavy-lidded satiation . He is jealous , and the genie , who is very clever indeed , leads him on by observing that there is more room in bottles than one would think . <P> Frank dives in for a look , and the genie stops up the bottle , returns it to the dusty store from which it came , and prepares to entertain the most beautiful girl himself . " In the end , " writes Collier wickedly , " some sailors happened to drift into the shop , and , hearing that this bottle contained the most beautiful girl in the world , they bought it up by general subscription of the fo'c'sle . When they unstoppered him at sea and found it was only poor Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the utmost severity . "
