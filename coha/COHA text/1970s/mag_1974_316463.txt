THIEVES LIKE US <P> Directed by ROBERT ALTMAN <P> Screenplay by CALDER WILLINGHAM , JOANTEWKESBURYand ROBERT ALTMAN <P> Robert Altman 's recent movies ( M*A*S*H , McCabe and Mrs. Miller and The Long Goodbye ) are like model kits . Each one comes in little pieces , some of which are lovingly and intricately fashioned . Each is made to scale for a specific genre : the service comedy , the western , the private-eye melodrama . Altman encloses no instructions , though . That is the challenge and the catch , and accounts in part for the appeal his films exercise for many critics . It is not that Altman movies are open-ended so much as that they are any-ended . They can be assembled in many ways and require only a little critical extrapolation ( any standard brand will do ) to hold them together . <P> Thieves Like Us would be filed under the subheading " On the Road : Crime and Aimless Kids . " That has been a flourishing category ever since the success of Bonnie and Clyde , but Thieves Like Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remake of Nicholas Ray 's excellent They Live by Night ( 1947 ) , which , along with Fritz Lang 's You Only Live Once , set the model in the first place . As usual , Altman supplies not an answer but an alternative to the styles and conventions of the genre . <P> Altman omits what is expectable in movies of this sort and includes the scenes that other film makers have left out . Bowie ( Keith Carradine ) is a young con who busts out of prison with a couple of older buddies ( John Schuck , Bert Remsen ) into the grim realities of the Depression South . Because they figure it to be no more antisocial than starvation , the trio start to rob small-town banks . They do it with matter-of-fact efficiency , and Altman treats them in the same even way . He is not concerned with the mechanics of the heist but the social subcurrents beneath it . Almost anyone else would have included a lot of hairbreadth getaway sequences , but Altman concentrates on portraying the glowering emptiness that daily confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of foggy existential desperation that surrounds his characters and lies at the core of the doomed affair between Bowie and a rather vacant girl called Keechie ( Shelley Duvall ) . <P> They meet with the impact and inevitability of an old tire and a rut in the road . <P> The sound track is filled with the sweet melodrama of old radio programs like Gangbusters , which Altman uses both to locate Bowie , Keechie and their pals in popular mythology and as an ironic counterpoint to lives that are too pressingly real . He gets fair , subdued performances from his cast and in addition admirably captures the poor rural South . Shot in muted autumnal tones , the film seems overcast , sad and dense with a kind of elemental menace .
