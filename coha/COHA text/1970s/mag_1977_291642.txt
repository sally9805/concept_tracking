FIVE SEASONS : A BASEBALL COMPANION <P> by ROGER ANGELL <P> 413 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $9.95 . <P> <P> Despite all the televised hoopla , there are still sports fans who find the Super Bowl an irritant or a snore . This same group is unmoved by the spectacle of professional basketball : ten tall millionaires in their underwear , jumping into the air every 24 seconds . Hockey ? Hooliganism on the rocks . Left cold by winter sports , these fans survive the icy months with summer memories and seasoned expectations . Baseball is their game , of course - the only game . If winter comes , can spring training be far behind ? <P> That was once what Baseball Fan and Author Roger Angell ( The Summer Game ; 1972 ) calls one of the " sunlit verities of the game . " Not any more . Disputes between owners and players have delayed spring training twice in the past five years - precisely the troubled period recaptured in Five Seasons . This bittersweet collection of baseball reporting recounts the fading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass in the ballparks and installed artificial surfaces ( " the cheaper spread " ) . Pitchers in the American League no longer take their cuts at the plate ; some thing called a designated hitter does that for them . Thanks to the delay of league play-offs and the lure of prime-time TV ratings , World Series games are regularly played on frigid October evenings . Last fall in Cincinnati , Angell notes , " the wretched , blanket-wrapped , huddled masses in the stands flumped their mittened paws together in feeble supplication , pleading now for almost any result that would send them home . " <P> An editor at The New Yorker ( where most of the 16 pieces originally appeared ) , Angell is a formidable humorist . Yet he sees all the current tinkering with baseball as no laughing matter . He imagines a time when the World Series will be totally surrendered to television , transported to some domed stadium , and made the excuse for a week of canned spectaculars . If network and baseball moguls have not already dreamed up this plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to conserve something that seems as intricate and lovely to us as any river valley . " <P> Horn Blowing . True fans need no convincing . They can read Five Seasons for remembrances of games , pennant races and World Series past , for another chance to think about their beloved sport under the tutelage of an expert . Yet Angell 's passion for baseball is enough to convert the heathen . Millions of casual TV viewers saw Red Sox Catcher Carlton Fisk 's extra-inning home run in the sixth game of the 1975 World Series . Angell 's account goes beyond the heroics on the field . He imagines people all over New England receiving the news- " jumping up and down in their bedrooms and kitchens and living rooms , and in bars and trailers , and even in some boats here and there , I suppose , and on backcountry roads ( a lone driver getting the news over the radio and blowing his horn over and over , and finally pulling up and getting out and leaping up and down on the cold macadam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not before it is inducted into the Hall of Fame of the mind .
