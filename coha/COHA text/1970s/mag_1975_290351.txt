No issue has more clearly mirrored the ideological split between the Ford Administration and the Democratic Congress than the six-month tussle over energy policy . Last week all hope of compromise seemed to fade : Congress recessed for a month without enacting any legislation acceptable to the White House to replace present price controls on oil . That made all but inevitable a result neither side professed to want : an abrupt end to the controls on Labor Day , opening the way for price hikes on all petroleum products , from gasoline to heating oil . The hikes would siphon off billions in consumer buying power and possibly threaten the growing recovery . <P> Last Stab . Just two days before they left for vacation , the House scuttled , 228 to 189 , President Ford 's final compromise plan for the gradual removal of oil-price regulations . At present , " old " oil - crude pumped in amounts equal to what was lifted in 1972-accounts for about two-thirds of domestic production and is price-controlled at $5.25 per bbl. ; " new " oil is uncontrolled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the controls on old oil over a 39-month period-postponing the biggest price boosts until after the 1976 elections - and set an initial ceiling of $11.50 on new oil . Congress then took one last stab at keeping the lid on prices by passing a simple six-month extension of present controls , which expire at midnight , Aug. 31 . Administration aides immediately repeated earlier warnings that the President will veto it . <P> The White House has consistently maintained that the free market must be permitted to kick up oil prices gradually , thus forcing energy conservation , stimulating domestic production and reducing U.S. dependence on imported petroleum . Economic Adviser Alan Greenspan has said that even abrupt decontrol would be preferable to continuation of the present restraints . Democrats generally fear that large price boosts would be dangerously inflationary , unfair to the poor and unjustifiably rewarding to oil companies . Many simply would not vote to raise prices , even though they knew the alternative to gradual decontrol could be sudden decontrol . <P> Political calculations deepened the impasse . Some Democrats cling to the hope that Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to take the blame for the price surge that might follow " cold turkey " decontrol , but White House advisers hope to divert the blame to the Democrats by noting that Ford had urged a more gradual program . Congress could try to override a veto and revive the controls when it returns in September , but it is doubtful that Democrats could muster the two-thirds majority required .
