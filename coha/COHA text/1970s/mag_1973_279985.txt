The U.S. aerospace industry has long booked itself on a nonstop flight into the future , speeding from one set of new aircraft to more advanced successors on the horizon . Now the horizon is empty , and has been since Congress shot down the American supersonic transport two years ago . For the first time since World War II , U.S. aerospace companies have no new generation of silvery flying ships that is imminently scheduled to zoom off the drawing boards and onto the production line . Some aerospace men are not bothered by what they regard as a welcome breathing spell , but others are . Says Eastern Air Lines Vice President Scott Crossfield : " I practically guarantee that the next new aircraft purchased by U.S. lines will be bought abroad . " <P> The U.S. lags behind European consortiums in building two other types of aircraft that could well become workhorse transports by the latter half of the decade . One is a twin-engine wide-body jet for short-to medium-range hauls . The 300-passenger A-300B airbus , which is being built by a five-nation European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ; it is scheduled for commercial service next March . The other type is a STOL ( for short takeoff and landing ) plane for brief hops between urban airports . France 's Dassault-Brequet Mercure craft should be providing STOL-type service by year 's end , and no U.S.-built STOL will be available anywhere near then . Says Karl G. Harr Jr. , president of the Aerospace Industries Assoc. of America : " The Europeans are developing and flying aircraft for which no U.S. counterpart exists . " <P> American plane builders are hardly going out of business . Indeed , one reason for their lag in building the aircraft of the future seems to be their success in marketing the planes of the present . The three American wide-bodied jets - Boeing 's 747 , McDonnell Douglas ' DC-10 and Lockheed 's L-1011-are selling so fast that they are providing airlines with more seats than can be filled . Thus the U.S. companies see no market for new planes any time soon , and they have not pushed development of the advanced designs that they do have . Boeing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and McDonnell Douglas has undertaken advance planning on an airbus that could be built from its DC-10 design , but it has held up on production . Says Vice President Jackson McGowen : " No American company has committed itself to the A-300B airbus with which the McDonnell plane would compete and even in Europe sales are going slowly . The airlines are not ready for it . "
