" Richard Nixon may not listen to Dr. Tkach , but he 'll certainly take advice from Dr. Miller . " That waspish Washington gibe reflected the cynicism , perhaps unfair , that greeted the news that this week the ex-President will finally enter a hospital for treatment of his thrombophlebitis . Dr. Walter Tkach , of course , is the former White House physician who two weeks ago , on a flying trip to California , had no luck at all in persuading Nixon to go into a hospital . Tkach even quoted his patient as saying that he feared he would die if he did so . " Dr. " Miller , of course , is Nixon 's lawyer , Jack Miller , who knows that health grounds could possibly help Nixon escape taking the stand as a witness in upcoming trials . <P> In California , Nixon 's medical care is being handled by the ex-President 's longtime friend and personal physician , Dr. John C. Lungren , an internist and cardiologist . Until 1971 he was chief of staff at the Memorial Hospital Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clemente . That is where Nixon will be taken this week . Before flying to San Clemente to see her father , Julie Nixon Eisenhower told a press conference in New York City : " Mother says he is more irritable than usual , but that is because of his leg ... He is taking medication and getting better , but he has to go in for a checkup . " <P> Newsmen clustered outside the gates of San Clemente were able to pick up only a few crumbs of information . For a while , television crews tuned in on walkie-talkie conversations between Secret Service men patrolling the grounds , including regular reports on the whereabouts of " Searchlight , " as Nixon is code-named . Then the Secret Service got wise and all that the TV crews could hear was an electronic hissing . But newsmen did learn that Nixon was still driving a golf cart to his office a short distance from the house . He was seen in the swimming pool and walking about the grounds without crutches or a cane . <P> While Nixon is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . A California judge must decide whether to grant their motion to quash a subpoena for Nixon to appear in Santa Ana and give a deposition in a civil suit challenging security arrangements at a 1971 rally in Charlotte , N.C. The plaintiffs charge that their civil rights were violated when they were refused entry . Miller &; Co. argue that giving the deposition would impose an " unreasonable burden " on their ailing client .
