Lists and collections prepared by storytellers are of greater value than those that present material for other purposes and are often arranged according to form or subject . Other excellent sources for lists of good stories to tell are found in publications of the New York Public Library , the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh , and the Enoch Pratt Free Library . Baker and Greene in their Storytelling:Art and Technique have added immeasurably to choices for the storyteller . For the uninitiated , the selection of a good story presents another quandary . It must be decided just what makes a story difficult to prepare , and how diligent an apprentice is willing to work since many of the most appealing tales appear to be the most difficult . When the teller is familiar with a story , however involved it may seem to others , preparation time is shortened . Much of " The Elephant 's Child " 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country , " 1b and The Bojabi Tree11 must be so well remembered that none of the exquisite flavor is lost . The learning of these stories could be equivalent to memorization . To experience the sharing of these particular stories , however , is more than worth the effort . Beginners may be discouraged from preparing tales such as these , but an instructor should never interfere when a student is determined to try . The challenge to prove an instructor in error is great , and the apprentice will generally do a good job . Too , there is something to be said for allowing ( or even requesting ) students in a controlled group , where they have instructional aid , to start with a demanding selection . An instructor experimenting with selection and degrees of difficulty , asked each of a group of students to learn the same story , The Five Chinese Brothers . 12 The story is not excessively long ; there are familiar patterns ; but there are areas which must be treated with care . After three days members of the group told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted in only two of the first-timers . Out of a class of ten , only two had had any previous storytelling experience ; the selection had been made for them , and the learning of it had been done by their own methods before any classroom discussion of technique . // Comparative information from other storytelling teachers about the advantages of students ' beginning a crash course with the learning of one moderately difficult story to save precious time would have been useful . But lacking such information , the project was thoroughly explained , and the cooperation of the class was requested . Demonstrations by the instructor were given starting on the first day , but at no time did she tell the story being used in the exercise . She was , however , an enthusiastic listener . The students were deeply involved with the study also ; two of the eight who had had no previous experience were judged , in secret voting by their classmates , to have given a most creditable performance . The stumbling block for the others was trying to get straight which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the experiment , it was felt that the students had benefited from starting with a story to learn ( instead of a lecture ) and that the selection had been a medium-to-hard one to master . A lengthy discussion of the brothers and their special gifts that followed the learning project pointed up the value of such a step in the preparation process . Before the course was over , the students were laughing about it all and calling themselves " the ten Chinese sisters . " Following the experiment , simple folktales appeared to be a breeze . " The Old Woman and Her Pig , " " Teeny Tiny , " and " Master of All Masters " were learned rapidly and told well . These three stories13 are short , but they present special opportunities for innovation . Whether or not the story is easy to learn , the first factor to be considered in selection is the audience with whom it is to be shared . The second most important consideration should be the literary merit of the material . Many writers of storytelling procedure find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be liked before it is chosen . There is some doubt , however , that storytellers ever select a tale they do not enjoy . Doing so would be unfair to all concerned , and few speakers would ever make this mistake . There is much prejudging  --  and winnowing out  --  of stories before final choices are made for telling . Society has // already chosen which folktales are to survive , and writers , collectors , and artists have exercised thoughtful care in the preparation of new versions . Editors choose carefully among many manuscripts ; the bibliographers and buyers choose what they think will be borrowed or bought . Too , the opinionated are not in the silent minority . They are quick to let it be known when a certain story may be offensive to a segment of the community . Good taste will prevent the thrusting of a Christmas story upon an audience who had not made a request for such a specific theme . A storyteller will know that many groups prefer " just a good story " unless other choices are made known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offences of sexism , national chauvinism , racism . Even The Five Chinese Brothers has become anathema to some . " The Five Chinese Brothers : Time to Retire " is the lead article in a recent issue of Interracial Books for Children Bulletin . 20 What a pity , especially now that the United States Congress is considering extending the age limit for retirement ! Racism  --  or intolerance of all kind and degree  --  has robbed children of some attractive stories . But good manners and one 's own sensitivity dictate the omission of certain tales when thoughtful folk have judged against them . To Southerners , the hardest story to give up was " The Wonderful TarBaby , " by Joel Chandler Harris . This story died twice : in one respectable collection it was chopped in half ( an omission that may have been due to the compiler 's not realizing there was more to it , that the author had used delaying tactics and had finished it up later in the volume in which it had appeared originally ) .

There may be stories that must not be told , but there are those that must be told for it is upon stories that speech , conversation , and advertising are based . References to characters in stories such as these permeate much of living and literature . To fail to recognize the traits , characteristics , habits , and adventures of story friends is never to belong . More practically speaking , the full meanings of news articles and commentaries can sometimes never be appreciated without understanding story characters or actions upon which they may be predicated . // Adult listeners want to be reminded of stories they heard in their youth ; to enjoy reliving the robust humor of Mark Twain 's " Jim Baker 's Bluejay Yarn " 15 ; and the understated magnificence of " The Piece of String " and " The Diamond Necklace . " 16 Selection of stories for an adult audience can be as time-consuming as choosing tales for youngsters . Older folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also pleased with stories of strong adventure : characters accomplishing feats that they can no longer perform ( or ever could ) . Tales of the locale in which the listeners live are particularly popular . The literary quality of a story is more important to an audience that is highly educated , but all adults are willing to listen to simple stories , especially when children are present . Groups of mothers and grandmothers are always eager to hear new stories they can retell later to small kin at nap or bedtime . When stories are being chosen for a group of quite elderly or handicapped oldsters , several short ones have been found to be better than one long tale . Adult audiences are courteous , but they have a tendency to become restless ; to move about even more than small children . Young adults are easily pleased  --  believe it or not ! Almost any tale worth the telling is well received if it has literary merit and is well told . It should also have that something extra , and the characters should be recreated so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say something worthwhile . A story that moves , has suspense , contains a soupcon of humor , and a conclusion that winds up with a resolution of an earlier identifiable struggle , is most appealing to them . Folktales contain most of these ingredients . A storyteller was once delighted with a roomful of seniors in a speech class at a prestigious university , who sat in . a classroom ( one side all glass and open to the busy campus a few steps beyond ) and listened to the simplest of cumulative tales . One snowy afternoon in New York City over thirty years ago , Mary Gould Davis told Seumas MacManus ' " Billy Beg and His Bull " 17 to a group of teenage boys en route from one juvenile hall of correction to another . ( Somewhere , some34 The Story Experience one cared enough to offer these young men one perfect moment . ) With no more ado than to say her name and the title of her story , she began . Their eyes never left her face : she mesmerized them completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to say what will appeal to young adults all the time , or any part of the time , and each storyteller must work the best magic , hoping that the enthusiasm and the pleasure in the sharing will weld the teller and the listener together . On the Saturday morning following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , a group of high-school students at a convention listened to a storyteller tell selections from the writings of and about this lost and mourned young leader . Their caring attitude and appreciation of his words alone seemed almost memorial enough . The storyteller has a singular obligation in this questioning age , in that sensitivity and sincerity must accompany the telling ; it is of great importance to be at ease with both audience and material . In choosing stories to share with young children , it is wise to select tales that portray characters doing the things that small children do . Children have the ability to relate to both out-of-doors and inside " sets , " and they are comfortable when there is a mixture of adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience with which young children are familiar . Humanized animals , too , are pleasing as subjects , and little children do not shy away from fantastic adventures . What have they not imagined all by themselves ? Nothing . Relationships , however , must be valid . It is not necessary that all of the story be easy to understand . Boys and girls know intuitively that mysteries exist that will unravel themselves when the time comes . They are willing to accept strange and unfamiliar words . For the most part , young listeners want a story told by an enthusiastic , warm person with feeling for the titillating joke , and to find the story has excitement ( good plot ) and a comfortable ending ( things coming out all right ) . One of the failures of research anent children and their listening habits is in probing into the value of listening to stories . Such a study is reported , however , in a recent doctoral dissertation by Elsie Ziegler. 18 It reveals that chitA // dren exposed to activities in a creative dramatics program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children listening to stories , however , demonstrated significant gains in these two areas . Children 's librarians knew this all along ! Access to many resources is needed , and one must turn to selection aids , not only to determine merit , but to locate works  --  either the tales themselves or information about material . New versions of folk tales are to be found in lists of books by contemporary authors and artist-authors in The Horn Book Magazine , which is one of the most reliable sources for news of gems such as Verna Aardema 's Why Mosquitos Buzz in People 's Ears and Beatrice Schenk De Regniers ' Little Sister and the Month Brothers . Similar titles are found here , reviewed by experienced critics . The Horn Book19 is the one publication that reviews current titles quickly and well . Bibliographies found in texts , anthologies , and articles on children 's literature and storytelling come too late for the impatient student who wants to know now . Students ask a good question when they inquire why writers on these subjects are slow to include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow the student , leading the searcher in the wrong direction . In an attempt to arrange stories by levels , one collection states that " The Story of the Three Bears " and The Jungle Book may be used with the same group . They may go well together in the zoo , but it will be wise to keep them separated in the story hour . This is certainly true when the listeners are inexperienced . After a story has been selected for telling , it is well for the beginner to read several versions of the same story if these exist . It is a rewarding exercise . For example : although the variations in the actual body of " The Princess on the Pea " are few , there are three different titles : the one above , " The Real Princess , " and " The Princess and the Pea . " Such irresponsible titling practices are confusing to the beginner . Marie L. Shedlock , Valdemar Poulsen , Mrs. Edgar V. Lucas , Erik Christian Haugaard , and Paul Leyssac are among the translators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variance is encountered in Harris ' " The Wonderful Tar-Baby . " One editor , as noted above , missed out completely when she did not know that the story // has two parts in the authoritative text , Uncle Remus : His Songs and His Sayings.20 May Arbuthnot tried to rescue the tar-baby by rewriting the story to omit the dialect , in Time for Fairy Tales , Old and New.21 Gruenberg , also , has refined the language , but ( as others ) has inadvertently left off the last half of the story . 22 The new versions lose something in this effort , however gracious it may be . A beginner should study and compare such a situation as three separate stories having a similar plot . One case involves the three stories , " Tom Tit Tot , " " Rumpelstiltskin , " and " Duffy and the Devil . " The first and third tales are English variants , the first coming from Suffolk and the third , from Devonshire , and labeled Cornish . " Rumpelstiltskin , " of course , is straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it differently . Jacobs does not hesitate to say that he prefers " Tom Tit Tot " over " Rumpelstiltskin , " 23 but not all anthologists are so inclined . There are more good versions of the German story listed in catalogs than of the British variant , although Arbuthnot includes both of them in Time for Old Magic . 24 This type of study is not necessary to telling either version well , but some exploration of this nature should be suggested to the apprentice in order to give body to the understanding of the art of selection . As for " Duffy and the Devil , " no storyteller should be denied the privilege of knowing and appropriating with great glee , the Harve Zemach presentation . A lecturer can guide students as they study the art of selection , and it is helpful to ask apprentices to state the titles of their favorites and to discuss them . The reminiscences of a variety of adults serve as stimulants to the whole class , and the instructor can discover just how far along in the story experience the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock at learning how benighted some of today 's students are , but one should attempt to help the beginner overcome the lack of a personal storytelling heritage . The instructor should pay close attention to the stories that are named since they represent the students ' backgrounds : the stories they have read and heard , and the story programs they may have given through formal telling , multimedia presentations , or reading aloud . // When storytellers are creative they can fashion a story from a single chapter of a full-length book ( if it can stand being lifted from the whole ) . Even though the apprentice may choose to limit him or herself to folktales for the first expedition into storytelling , here , too , one must exercise caution and do a little comparison-shopping among the multitude of offerings . Older boys and girls , and young adults , still searching for heroes , listen with an almost holy intensity to a welltold story of a famous person who is a favorite of both the teller and the listeners . It is challenging to combine parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found to complement each other ; this activity borders on the telling of original material which the storyteller may have written . Practice of this nature comes in handy when a fulllength book must be shortened without breaks in the story line . One must be wary of striking sections that advance the plot and give reasons for certain actions . Although most folktales need no cutting , longer stories , novellas , and complete books must be treated to the shears . It is not difficult to create phrases with the same words used by the author and to piece out the gaps . When this is not possible , similar words and an imitative style can be employed if the sequence and the spirit of the tale are not lost . The experienced storyteller may wish often to tell personally created material , and at one time the National Story League required its members to write and tell their own stories at least once a year . Sometimes it is necessary to create material from primary sources to make special people or events come alive . This takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and librarians may find creative writing hard to reconcile with their busy days and nights . Some who also write , find it hard to tell their own stories . Since there are many examples of master storytellers doing just that , it could be either that the hard-to-tell stories are not written well enough , or that the storyteller is not skilled or objective enough in presenting them . The storyteller who enjoys writing and telling original stories , however , will be able to polish and to add special effects , and to fashion characterizations that will move the // action and refine the story content . This is a real opportunity for the teller to gain experience in letting a story flow , to add bits and pieces as they are coaxed out by the enthusiasm of the listeners . During such an occasion a tape recorder ( with the audience knowing it is on ) can be used to get the story as it is told . A replay , with the gasps and the laughter , makes such an experience very personal and could excite even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should show great improvement in the technique of the storyteller and point up efficacious pruning of the material . Too , the recording demonstrates  --  reassures the beginner about  --  the pleasure with which the story was received . A storyteller turned writer should be cautioned against allowing material to become too personalized unless the experiences are exceptional . A storyteller has a unique opportunity when presenting a picture book with no words . Such an experience was shared by one children 's librarian and a group of adults  --  and later , children : the story was one created by the storyteller who was motivated by the illustrated , non-verbal book , The Good Bird . 25 The adults found it difficult to relate to what was happening ; the children knew exactly . They thought the stories they built and told aloud ( after they had listened to the story by the speaker ) were much superior ! Of such variety in action , the storyteller forms a background and begins a repertoire . A file with pertinent information such as sources , copies of edited material , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tapes and/or cassettes to show the stages of the teller 's progress in writing and telling original material , and notes of evaluations of programs  --  all should be kept safe for instant use . This private source of information points up again the " two strings to one 's bow , " and reduces the trauma of story selection . With one 's own native good sense , a feel for appropriate material , with knowledge of what will be enjoyed , one may search out volumes by the dozens . With the previewing being done by professionals , collections will be as failsafe as possible , and the storyteller may wander among the stacks finding much to like and to share . Let it be special . When it is shaped and molded , // and spoken afresh by a storyteller who paints deftly in choice words , ( both one 's own and the author 's ) , a living , strong message will come out . Chapter Five FASHIONING A HAPPENING From the moment of decision , when the story to be told has been selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . The first reading , during the period of selection , has alerted the teller to the appropriateness of the material for the specific occasion ; its length , the style , and the mood in which it is written ; the plot , dominant characters , and special phrases ; and any special problems to be solved . Additional early readings point up the significant action that moves the plot along , the humor that lightens serious events , and the sequences that appeal most to the teller . The need for any editing or adapting soon emerges , as well as whether or not there is any memorization necessary : rhymes , songs , lists of names of persons , places or things , chants , quotations , or long , recurring descriptive phrases found in cumulative tales . Study of the material may be compared with an analysis of a happening , and one may call to mind the parts of a news story . A conversation with a friend telling of an event that has occurred in the home or neighborhood , or a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party or a wedding , are similar in structure to most tales one will select to learn over the years . The conversational style in the telling is like that used to relate newsy events to friends . One sees the comparison , understands the ageold connection between newsgatherers and storytellers . As one reads one identifies the sequences that make up the beginning , middle , and end of the story , and the storyteller may wish to put on paper a diagram of the material that will help in learning the selection . The Funny Thingl is a light , humorous , yet precise , tale of " Bobo , the good little man of the mountains , " who " at the door of his mountain cave " fed the squirrels , birds , 41 // long-eared rabbits , and the little mice . Within its thousand or so words it introduces two special surprises for its listeners : an animal who wants to be called an aminal and a new word , " jum-jills , " for the special food Bobo prepares for it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herman Melville , and Edith Rickert . Bobo and the funny thing are the speaking characters ; the minor ones are the birds who , in the ending , feed jum-jills to the aminal . The aminal has chosen to give up eating good children 's dolls and is content to sit , hardly moving , on the top of the big mountain  --  necessary because its tail keeps getting longer and longer . So , it sits , displaying the pretty black eyebrows , the row of blue points down its back , and the tail that grows and curls contentedly around the mountain . After several readings , one identifies the first setting to be in the mountains with the sun playing hide-and-seek ; fluffy floating clouds , soft warm air . A bit of extra charm , relative to the beauty and the grandeur of the mountains , may be added verbally when the listeners are living in coastal areas . No introduction , of course , is necessary when the audience is of the foothills or higher elevations , but recognition by the speaker of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kindle an even greater pride in this experience than is already theirs . It helps , too , to build a greater rapport between the storyteller and the audience . The second setting is Bobo 's home in a cave , and the listener is delighted with the description of the floor plan of the kitchen where Bobo makes up the various foods he prepares for the animals . The third set is the mountain top that the aminal has chosen as the convenient place to house itself and its tail as it eats more and more jum-jills . To describe the little round balls that are " very good , " the storyteller must remember the ingredients : figure Mix with a spoon and roll into little round balls . Place on a plate and feed to aminal. // The entire story can be easily followed in one 's mind , for it unwinds the mountains , the sun , the clouds as gracefully as the unrolling of a film . Bobo is in front of the cave , waiting for the birds and the small animals who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each are easy to remember since both Bobo , and the listener , know the animals ' preferences . Into this idyllic scene comes the funny thing : something like a dog , a little like a giraffe . The special physical features of the aminal add to its uniqueness ; its appetite for dolls is startling . Since Bobo can not accept the aminal 's taste for " good children 's good dolls , " he has to come up with a solution to this dilemma . After selling the funny thing the idea of the gourmet delight that will enhance the beauty of its eyebrows and tail , he mixes up a batch of jum-jills . All ends happily . As one reads the picture story it is obvious that the illustrations carry many subtle drawings that are not incorporated into the tale : the furniture in the bedroom , the desk in the den , and the table and bowl in the kitchen . Since the storyteller desires to make the story vivid , satisfying , and cozy  --  like a doll 's house  --  a simple mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text . One storyteller enjoys adding color to the bowl and giving a wooden texture to the spoon . With these , and a few other touches , she makes the telling her own particular creation without cheapening the folktale quality of the original theme . While this particular story really needs nothing deleted nor added , some of these suggestions may be considered for their applicability to other stories . One notes that few gestures are indicated in The Funny Thing , but the storyteller may find the stirring together of the four ingredients irresistable . A firm line , however , must be drawn between these hand movements and any representation of the fluttering birds or the fluffy clouds . The use of gestures can demonstrate the skill of the storyteller , but there is much negative regard of this practice . Experienced storytellers , however , with whom gestures are natural and who understand their tasteful use , discover more need for them in telling stories to the mentally handicapped . A good rule of thumb concerning gestures is that they can be used with additional pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . All delicate , fairy-like movement , or ethereal qualities of the story , should be left to the imagination . A hint of a gesture , a slight motion , is generally more effective and much more elegant . The Funny Thing is a winner for beginners and experienced storytellers , and is well-received by listeners from any ethnic background . Most children have made friends with imaginary animals , and listeners are always caught up in the outsmarting of a villain however much like a pussy cat the miscreant may become . The use of flattery is practiced by everyone at some time . This story , as many other original themes and folktales , may be dressed up or down . The ending can be faded back into the same sunshiny day the story opened with . Real magic has been sensed . It was really **25;300;TOOLONG ; who is to say really which ? This feeling out of the salient points  --  or imaginative possibilities  --  of a story may be repeated in getting acquainted with any new material . Attention paid to identifying special features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not interfere with the smooth learning of it . Presently , many storytellers are selecting pictured tales in a similar format and find Marcia Brown , Janina Domanska , Paul Galdone , Nonny Hogrogian , Ezra Jack Keats , Blair Lent , Leo Lionni , Evaline Ness , and Maurice Sendak marvelous partners in the fun . After several readings , if major editing is indicated , it is important to reassess the story for possible replacement by a simplified version , if one can be found . One may decide to search for an entirely different tale . However , when one feels capable of improvisation this may be attempted . The storyteller must be careful to preserve the style , purpose , and mood , as well as the freshness that the author has created in the original material . A study of all sequences must follow so that no clue , no important detail is omitted . It is advisable for the apprentice to think carefully before attempting revision , but the novice must begin sometime to practice this skill . Material that presents more problems than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many wonderful tales begging to be told for any storyteller to have to worry about shortening , adapting , changing , or forcing material to fit a given pattern or occasion . // In the 1930 's when storytelling was , perhaps , at its height , teachers and librarians were trained to tell stories by being advised to just read and read ; to reread and reread ; and to tell the story aloud to oneself ( or to anyone who might be willing to listen ) over and over again . But once it is understood that catching the flavor of a tale is the most important step , it is easy enough to read up on newer suggestions , and then to devise one 's own method . The recreative method , discussed and approved over a half-century ago by the authors of A Handbook of Children 's Literature , 2 was basic to the techniques used by many librarytrained storytellers of that period . Some parts of the story were remembered , some memorized . It may be well to experiment with several methods to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always keep in mind never to be afraid of a story . Jotting down an analysis of the tale , with a diagram , or placing sequences in word-panels is an easy way to begin . Most experts advise against memorization of the material word by word , although some storytellers come to this approach naturally . The warning comes in all sincerity since the inexperienced may surely stumble over lines at one time or another . Too much emphasis against " dramatics " in a story presentation may have been given also . The storyteller should remember that the story must sparkle to impress the listener . To learn how to tell a tale with flair is a step in the right direction . When the storyteller has a gift for the dramatic , and this gift is trained and controlled , the presentations , like the little bear 's porridge , should be just right . Critics tend to confuse dramatization with artificial enthusiasm and a vague disrespect of the material . . Nevertheless , it is during the preparation of a story that these decisions must be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems when learning each new story . Once a satisfactory method is developed the business of mastering material will come naturally and automatically , and one will get on with the show . Now that classes in storytelling are prevalent ; when the learning process is made more understandable and easier , it is a shame that fewer teachers and librarians working with children care to become storytellers. // If fear of learning stories to tell is responsible for the paucity in numbers of storytellers , here are some suggestions to slay the dragon . The study procedure should begin with pleasure and anticipation , and one should become familiar with the material through analysis of its parts and visualization of the sequences in logical order . Any needed changes in text should be made , and a copy of the story as it will be learned should be typed , taped , or prepared in some more or less permanent form . Purchase of the original material will allow changes to be made directly onto the page , and this ensures its availability for future programs . A tape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to listen to oneself , to be one 's own audience ; to listen for conversational , natural dialogue ; to judge the use of pauses , the overall pace of the story , and one 's breathing habits . Breathing and swallowing faults are common  --  and noticeable  --  and any habit that detracts from a presentation must be of concern to the storyteller . Listening to a tape is also good for anchoring the story as a whole . Awkward hesitations caused by searching for the correct word can be noted , and eliminated through a quick look at the text and more practice . A videotape of a work period is invaluable , and an opportunity to make one should be made available to each student in a formal study program . Some storytellers carry the material around with them , snatching peeks at a free moment , but one must be careful not to misplace the book ! Some have been so engrossed in mumbling a story  --  while driving  --  that the police have added their own sequence to the tale . Such attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are not to be condoned . Several periods of total concentration will serve , preventing possible upsets on the freeway . One hears much about mental pictures being allowed to run through the mind , but of equal importance is the " hearing " of dialogue . What one sees and hears is what is shared . This step will fix the words belonging to the action , also pointing up what gestures the characters might use in speaking in the imagined scene . Too , any necessary voice changes may become obvious . One should not , however , begin too early to fit words to action . This synthesis may come naturally ; give it a chance . Before one goes to sleep at night and upon awakening in the morning are excellent times to run through the material . // The apprentice should not hesitate to break up a story to learn it . Beginning to live with certain bits of action and dialogue and then adding more provides the sort of closeness that enables the student to feel completely at home with the tale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cement certain descriptive words or phrases forever to delineate specific characters , settings , and action ; in this way the part-by-part approach will not confuse . Logical transitional phrases will connect sections of the plot when one sees the story as a whole . Add light touches to make the presentation one 's own . Consider the effective gestures , pay attention to the pause , do pantomime , especially in folktale material , and do not forego  --  nor disparage  --  the dash of dramatic flair . When there are several important characters , one of the lesser figures may be chosen to help set atmosphere , mood , and pace . In learning " Molly Whuppie " one storyteller selects the giant 's wife as guide to help set the mood of the night 's drawing in , the darkness of the forest , and the mystery of the house in the wood . At the conclusion of the story , the giant 's wife is prominent in a humorous sequence that lightens an otherwise fierce ending . This tale is an excellent one to choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be bored with Molly . Some storytellers find it helpful to practice in front of a mirror ; if a storyteller can face that ( even with some merriment ) , she or he should be able to face anyone ! This procedure is also helpful to an inexperienced student in learning to tolerate more quickly minor disturbances that may arise during a presentation . Such experience is necessary when preparing material for television and a practice session on videotape is not possible . The storyteller will have some definite picture of what the viewers are seeing and will not keep searching for the monitor . The mirror lets the storyteller know which gestures are natural , which are not , and those that should be retained to serve as catalysts ( taking nothing away but clarifying and speeding action ) . Clever , significant gestures may be compared with the signature of an artist on a painting , the selahs of the Bible , and the rhymed couplets Shakespeare used to herald the conclusion of many scenes and acts . A story may actually come alive through one particu48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion used in telling a cumulative tale . This is true of the tactile relationship between the blind men and the elephant ; the " tsk , tsk , tsk , " of the peddler and the monkeys ' imitations . Storytelling calls for all the skills of a good speaker , and the greater one 's gifts of selection and presentation , the more seriously one should approach the fashioning of a story . It is at the learning step that the storyteller is most often spooked and stumbles . A check of the literature shows no written method guaranteeing an instant flawless story so that a listener may live happily ever after . The storyteller still has to devise a workable way to furnish the desired results . However , emphasis on the learning process should be treated in depth to assure the apprentice that every storyteller is afraid of failure at some time in the story experience . This fear evolves from the notion that one may not be able to compete with the visual entertainment and the fast-paced lifestyle of even the very young . Apprentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience of any kind . The novice may be excused for this fear : it is only human to want success . Any distrust of oneself in the storytelling process should be used as an incentive to prepare the material properly , to spend more time in selection , to approach the learning experience with more pleasure , and in a happier , more relaxed state of mind . The viewing of two films will help the apprentice to become acquainted with techniques used by accomplished storytellers : " There 's Something About a Story " and " The Art of Telling Stories to Children . " 3 These films are often shown to classes in storytelling , and students say they encourage and give support in the mastering of the art . The films also demonstrate that anyone who is truly interested need not feel dread nor fear drudgery . The films portray many examples of adults enjoying the story experience : selecting the story , planning the presentation , shaping the material , and letting it all burst forth in joy . Chapter Six " ONCE UPON A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging of merchandise , and meticulous care is taken with items to b presented as gifts . So must the gift of a story be wrapped it a tissue of mystery and tied with a magic bow . The enchantment begins with the setting of a mood , relaxed but expectant . Every visible person and object , each audible sound has its own particular role . Precautions to assure a convenient , comfortable time and place , and an enthusiastic person for the telling , have been taken . The wheels of every scrap of machinery have been oiled and inspected . The moment is now , and all evidence of work , planning , and preparation has disappeared . The storyteller , tastefully and unobtrusively dressed , has arrived early and is eager to greet the guests with warmth . There should be no final flurry of activity , no loud acclaims of a forgotten duty , nor last exchanges of talk with another adult . The story hour has begun . As the audience gathers , the storyteller is sorting out who will enjoy the story most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who will become bored and restless . The storyteller ( if a guest ) will have arranged for a short , or better , no introduction , unless the audience is primarily adult . When the storyteller is no stranger to the group , one is in clover . This is the perfect time for the story to begin . The story hour symbols are in place ( if they are to be used ) : the candle is burning , the music is silenced ; coats and purses are stowed under the chairs or are on the floor beside the listeners and their cushions . The fresh flowers are a bright spot ; the display books , if any , are arranged conveniently near . How elegant if it is winter and there is the added luxury of a blazing , saffron fire on a big stone hearth . 50 // If favors or food , treats of any kind , are to be a part of the affair , they should not be on display in sight of the group , especially , if the audience is predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party to follow are made after the stories . During a holiday season , a storyteller was pressured into telling " one more story " to aid a group of adults who were a bit slow in preparing refreshments in a room separate from the program . As soon as the helpers had finished their preparations , a door behind the storyteller ( who , of course , was right at a most exciting place ) was flung open and a loud and happy invitation was called for the children to " Come and get it ! " The poor storyteller was almost crushed by the enthusiastic audience rushing for the eats . This situation could have been minimized if the storyteller had thought to stand facing the door . The pause , between the last necessary noise of the settling down and the first noises that denote a restlessness for the program to begin , is similar to the instant the quarterback calls for the football to be snapped into play : this is the moment that counts . Introductions or information about the story must be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include only what is absolutely necessary . Explanation of unfamiliar words can be accomplished easily by giving immediately after uttering the word , a short throwaway definition . Librarians once belabored a storyteller who was demonstrating storytelling to them for not explaining the word " yam " used by Courlander in his story " Talk . " Being from the Southern part of the world , the storyteller had never considered this word unfamiliar , but the incident could have been avoided by her adding , after " yam , " the first time around , which in the text appears in the plural , " sweet potatoes ! " The handling of problems such as this , and of any surly or disruptive attitudes , have been perfectly dealt with in " The Story-Teller " by Saki  --  a story all storytellers should discover for their amusement and profit . When the storyteller has planned to seek special support from the audience with a straightforward request , this may be accomplished early on , but hard on its heels comes the opening of the story , spoken softly , distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of magic and joy , " Once there was , " " Once upon a time , " " There was // once , " " Long , long ago , " or a borrowed beginning from Kipling or Wilde , but never with an opening that asks a question . The storyteller may develop a special beginning that can be used many times during a long career : the introduction of invisible friends or a pantomime of the opening of a bag of tricks or gifts . One day , a storyteller who enjoyed starting with a pantomime of the flicking from her right forefinger , the invisible Tyll , l and from her left , the fairy Tillette , 2 was telling stories to children and teachers in the auditorium of a large elementary school . She sent the invisible friends to chat together near a flowerpot sitting in a window to her left , behind where she stood . All went well until an unnoticed vibration , somewhere in the old building , managed to dislodge the pot , sending it with a scraping sound from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , when she would meet any of the kids or teachers from that school , they walked judiciously around her , asking if she had her invisible friends along . A magical inference may be used to quiet lively young listeners , and a perfect passage to paraphrase is the bewitching " the sound ... was the sound of the grass growing or the corn rijening or the holly reddening  --  which is to say no sound at all . " This is the noise one may subtly suggest be made by the youngsters . ( Ruth Sawyer never fails the storyteller . ) Now , the speaker catches the eyes of the audience and looks deeply into each pair . Also during a story , a friendly , understanding glance into the right set of eyes will silence an eager tongue or still a wandering hand ( or foot ) seeking expression . The eyes have it  --  and sometimes unexpectedly so . Once a storyteller visited a branch library in a Finnish neighborhood of a large city . She had come through a deep fall of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first story she felt an unsettling sensation . Something was wrong . The experience was different from any she had ever had . She looked again at the children . Silently , she questioned each pair of bright eyes looking into hers . Without breaking the rhythm of the story , she became more and more disquieted . All at once she laughed out loud . Each pair of eyes in front of her  --  were blue ! Bright blue , crystal-sparkling eyes : the mystery was solved . Yes , the eyes have it , but so do the hands . It is // said that a greater proportion of the brain is devoted to the control of the hands than to any other part of the body . The hands are clever , expressive , suggestive , quick , furtive , and even the merest motion from one can create a mood . A hand , even one finger , can summon , reject , accuse , command , emphasize , point up , point down , and admonish . The use of the head may also highlight portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , may distract or beguile the audience . When gesturing comes easily , it can strengthen characterization . A child-audience , especially one composed of kids living in the central city , needs gestures . These children , sadly enough , are more accustomed to pushes , punches , and distorted faces than they are to a verbal request or courteous directions . Rule One , however , in gesturing is that the gesture always precedes the word or phrase it emphasizes . Much is written anent the use of the voice , the training of it , and how one 's breathing patterns may be improved to enhance delivery . Pitch , enunciation , and breath control are three of the areas for study . Storytellers who have no obvious accent nor sectional drawl  --  no impediment  --  are fortunate , but listening to a tape of one 's voice will quickly identify any problems to be resolved . Ruth Sawyer , Ruth Tooze , and Caroline Bauer have a114 written well on this subject , and the apprentice should seek out and study their exercises and suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a friend , speaking into a tape recorder , making discs for radio programs and hearing these played back , all are good ways to know how one 's voice sounds to others . The storyteller may practice certain vowels and word-endings as a singer would run scales . Of first importance is that the storytellers speak distinctly and project their voices so that each person in the audience may be able to hear the softest whisper . Acoustics in many school and library conference and meeting rooms leave much to be desired . Lack of funds for improvement is a problem for storyteller and audience alike ; the storyteller who can act in a leadership role should work toward improvement in the story-hour environment . In the meantime , the storyteller is responsible for being heard in every corner of the area regardless of the size of the room or number of listeners in the audience . // Manipulation of the voice to aid character impersonation should be used sparingly , but apprentices will want to sharpen their skills in this direction whether or not they choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbreviated gestures that hint of a certain trait , and phrases that can identify various characters . Voice changes are effective , and they need not be sustained throughout the entire story . Any distinctive voice trick or mimicry should be maintained consistently and forcefully , however , for the moments it is in use . During a radio presentation when gestures can help only to put the storyteller in a mood , the voice does take on added significance since through this medium , the actual gestures mean nothing to the invisible audience . Gesturing has largely gone wrong , probably because elocutionists in the early twentieth century ( recitation and declamation contests compounding the crime ) over-used this technique . Voice changes and gestures when natural , however , can demonstrate the skills of storytelling , and set the better practitioners apart from those with less bent toward the art . Moderation in their use is still the key to good taste and welcome reception . Instructors are quick to spot the student who has that something extra and should be allowed and encouraged to use it . Body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well understood by the listeners , and is a major influence in the impression being made . In these silent mannerisms the audience is quick to see , and to measure , their purpose and effect , and can judge to what extent the speaker is sincerely and intimately involved in the experience . The use of the body exhibits innate reactions , and it communicates a sophisticated honoring of silence . Through it , the storyteller allows glimpses of the characters in their relationships with each other as they perform actions that advance the plot . In " Molly Whuppie , " the giant 's " business " of assembling the scissors , needle and thread , thimble , and other items , strengthens the interaction between Molly and the giant and gives mental images with which the listeners may work as they reconstruct the scene for themselves . This interplay between the giant and Molly is similar to that occurring between the storyteller and the group . The audience is now at one with the speaker , but it also functions as so many sep " Once // arate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The approach using minimal pantomime and invisible stage properties , can give a tremendous boost to simplifying the story-learning process as well as incurring the pleasure of the later listeners . Pantomime , while it accomplishes stage business , also aids in the pacing of a story . Since pace is influenced by plot development and the movement of characters , as well as the writer 's use of action verbs and the natural rate of speech of the storyteller , one can see the obvious correlation of pacing and the stage admonition of picking up one 's cues . The extent to which one is able to interpret the " business " of the characters is just so far as the storyteller is able to flesh out a solid experience for an audience , and it is only during such procedures , which reinforce the pantomime with realism , that the speaker 's eyes ever leave the listeners . With the audience as an important motivating force , an effective pace may be achieved . One hot Texas afternoon , a storyteller was recreating the myth of Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat and the arduous adventures of Jason , herself , but suddenly she caught sight of a small Mexican American who though following Jason avidly all the way , nevertheless looked distinctly uncomfortable . As Jason accomplished one exploit after another , the small face and hands became more and more expressive . The child was almost standing , was shaking with expectancy . The storyteller sensed an urgency to wrap up the story but then she saw his hands seek the lower front of his body , kneading his groin . The storyteller increased her pace , and , finally , as she tells it now , spoke the ending : " Jason grabbed the golden fleece , jumped on board the Argo , and sailed away . " She saw the young lad grab himself , dance up and down , and run from the room , shouting , " Jesus Christ ! He made it ! He made it ! " Acceleration of pace had saved the day . Regardless of children and their physical needs , a storyteller should increase slightly the tempo as the tale winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded a story , apprentices may have a healthy ( and valid ) fear of their ability to hold an audience of children . Students ask over and over what artifices may be used to minimize disruptions by the restless , but observant storytellers , arriving early , would have already spotted the possible troublemakers . // A short , arresting story , with a new twist , may be told before the main story in order to test the mood of the assembly . " Teeny Tiny " and " Master of All Masters " are good ones to use . A bit of poetry may be said if it is brief and carries a taste of humor . The something special that will insure the cooperation of the listeners is the warmth and the aura of caring cast by the storyteller , and the general sense of festival . It should not be necessary during a story to have to fall back on the questionable technique of calling the miscreants ' names to get their attention . The squeaking wheel should not always get the oil . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the attempt to soothe one or a few savage breasts by breaking the spell and talking to them . Catching the eye of the potential problem child may be all that is needed . A sly wink denotes a closeness and a sharing of something intimate between the one child and the speaker . It is friendly and in no way should it convey a correction or a reprimand . The result is that the one seeking special attention receives it from the adult , and the child may read into this private exchange any desired solace . The secret of resolution , however , lies in the ability of storytellers to handle themselves during a disturbance of any nature . In a small group one may be able quickly to identify potential disrupters , and to reach out to embrace or to move closer to them . One morning about twenty-five three- and four-year-olds were being shown a new large mediamobile . Nothing satisfied them , however , until they were promised a story . On the carpeted floor the children gathered happily , but there was one bouncy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , so thrilling , that he could not contain his exuberance . Jumping up and down , to judge whether or not he could dislodge the books from the walls of the vehicle , was more exciting to the lad than just sitting and listening to any story . The storyteller reached for him , pulled him down gently , and , enveloping him in the crook of her left arm , she continued with the story just begun . This action is an ageold device , and it has great merit . One should give serious thought to whether or not one will sit or stand to tell stories . The seated storyteller in the incident noted above was definitely at an advantage as she held the child ; while standing , however , at the first of the story , she was able to initiate quick action . One does learn to adapt ! // The position in which one tells a story is not always left to the preference of a storyteller . Large groups need to see , and standing is correct at such a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one loses many opportunities for body language . One storyteller has confided that standing is safer . She tells a story that when she was working with some small children once , and sitting with a child with wet pants on her left knee , a second child crawled near and whispered as he poked her right knee , " You 've got two laps ! " He promptly sat down and took advantage of this discovery . So , the most disastrous result of poor handling of discipline problems is when the storyteller blows both cool and cover . Instead , one should use the voice : lowering , not raising it ; attempt even stronger but quieter enthusiasm , and as far as possible , accept events as they develop . Overt actions , not associated with the story , and spoken corrections , out of character , are dangerous ploys for the apprentice . The experienced storyteller seldom has to resort to them . For reassurance for the speaker , some old hands suggest that a storyteller select ( in her or his own mind ) one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners . A particular individual 's reactions may indicate the mien and responsiveness of the audience . Ignoring the nottoo-naughty has also been found to discourage disruptions . The most disruptive influence on children being told stories are the adults who accompany them . They often do not care to sit and be a part of the scene , but since their sense of responsibility is strong , they remain . Then there is often much talking , getting up and down , reminding , and waving of hands and fingers in attempts to correct behavior . These verbal and physical interjections are more annoying than the whispers that demonstrate a release of tension building from the expected excitement to come . Adults are afraid that the kids will not reflect the good manners they have been taught , so they are anxious during the " performance . " But the solution is not for the adults to be excluded from the audience . One has only to say courteously before the stories begin that the storyteller will be glad to handle all discipline , is in charge of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program as listeners . Story hours go well more often than they do not . // Stock endings are attached to most folktales : " They lived happily ever after , " " If they did n't live happily ever after , it is nothing to you nor me , " " And that 's all " are beloved ones . Most writers of original themes add a throwaway line to their stories , too , but the storyteller may choose to add a favorite ending borrowed from a particular writer or tale  --  one that has become a sort of verbal signature . The ending has special significance since it serves to lift down the listeners to normal ground level , easing the flight from the stars , placing them firmly back on earth . Although it may seem a bit immodest for the storyteller to prepare an audience to applaud , when the assembly is composed mainly of children , it is wise to have the listeners participate in a general move to show appreciation of the story . Girls and boys should be taught that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the speaker is due a vote of confidence . This procedure is recommended not solely for the purpose of showing thanks to the storyteller alone , but to begin to shape young followers to appreciate any public speaker or entertainer . Children who are regulars at story hour are learning to function as a group , and they make good listeners for singers , instrumentalists , and others . When performers are not applauded today , it is not always that they have not amused nor entertained well , but that audiences do not know that this show of pleasure is appropriate . Clapping for a good story is a much more mature ending to the affair than for the storyteller to begin to inquire if the listeners have had a good time . The storyteller should not expect instant reaction to the story , and should not indulge in the too-common practice of expecting a child audience to want to jump up and act out the stories or to grab a crayon and begin to illustrate what they have experienced . The storyteller should be good enough to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it all straight , and may want to savor the stories a bit longer . It is quite rude to expect a verbal or motor reaction . When the flurry of conversation and coughing has passed , the stretching completed , the applause subsided , the storyteller may invite the audience to browse if books are available . Unless the storyteller is quite familiar with the audience , it may be decided that books will not be recom " Once // mended at this time . Books so often spell failure to many children ; especially those of the inner-city . The invitation to look at and to borrow books should be just that  --  an invitation . Some listeners come for the story ; they are n't readers , and they may have to be wooed patiently through means other than storytelling gatherings . The story hour is one of the true entertainments , and it should not be used as a gimmick . Here , the wheels of the machinery must be very quiet indeed . Ulterior motives to increase readership , however altruistic , must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table of books before the story . Although the story hour leads toward books and reading , of course , subtlety must be allowed to win the day . Adult audiences are different : they do not see themselves as targets for an eager pedagogue . They do not feel ( or at least not so often ) that they are being manipulated , as children sometimes do . So , beware the book with some children  --  one will know when the time comes . Books pressed upon a group ready for a story may set a wrong mood ; books afterward , may be anticlimactical , destroying a feeling or set of images left in the listeners ' imaginations . The story hour is to entertain ; it is not a come-on to force a child into a lifetime of serfdom , as some have been heard to say , to the printed word . The storyteller would be wiser to excuse the audience , with the blowing out of the candle and the wishing , if such had been arranged , and then to enter into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to the children who want personally to express appreciation for the event or to ask a question or just to chat . When children are first introduced to story hour , it is well that the storyteller explain to them that it is courteous , and much appreciated by the storyteller  --  or any other entertainer or host  --  for them to say a word of farewell as they leave . Many children who are shy with words , or do n't know exactly what to say , may wish to touch the adult who has pleased them . Many children hunger for closeness and will automatically , with pleasure , hug the storyteller , sometimes causing embarrassment and uncomfortableness . Regardless of the reaction the children exhibit , the storyteller should allow the response to be individual and spontaneous , but overexuberance should be courteously ( but quickly ) terminated . At the conclusion of the story hour , storytellers have // given their all ; they are tired and all-passion spent , and , for some , there may be a second group waiting . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have prepared a different program of material . Repeating the same stories is tiring  --  more tiring than changing about and introducing a new set of characters and plots . Even professional storytellers grow weary after a while , and they are not only better equipped but more accustomed to going on and on . Storytelling is hard work , but the apprentice must not become discouraged , since the rewards are unbelievably sweet . Chapter Seven " ... LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER . " The End ! All the parts of storytelling are but a prelude to the moment the storyteller brings the story to its conclusion . The atmosphere is charged with feelings  --  and these are what the listeners will take away . A brief pause , while the storyteller stands quietly , smiling , is necessary to allow the audience to come down to earth , reorienting itself into the everyday world . This speck of time is most poignant for storytellers . They have sought to add a new dimension to the lives of the listeners and they yearn to know the response . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyteller may have added others . The ending may have been clever  --  one that attached the original " signature " to the tale  --  or , it may have directed the listener away from the last seconds of heavy emotion . The conclusion may have set all to rights , or it may have left the solution to the audience as Frank Stockton did in " The Lady or the Tiger , " or Saki in " The Open Window " and " Tobermory . " The ending may be a surprise one such as Joseph Jacobs uses in " Teeny Tiny . " The storyteller may make a sudden gesture as Mark Twain wrote that he enjoyed doing . 1 Many variations are acceptable , but each should give a foretaste of the future , a good example of which is the classic , " ... and they lived happily ever after . " The last sentence may sum up what has gone before , or it may repeat what the audience thinks  --  that the incident is over , and all is well . Whatever the story 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story has meant to the audience . This mystery , however , is not often solved immediately and may in fact be long in coming . Verbal response should not be requested openly . Storytellers must train themselves to be 61 // courteous and allow individual persons to make any comment they may wish to speak , or to keep silent . The storyteller must remember that the true value of the experience can not be summed up quickly . One 's own reaction to the material , when it was first read and selected , will give some hint to its reception . What reaction did one wish to set in motion ? The speaker may have wanted the audience to gain a feeling of gaiety , or a deep sense of wonder . If it were a pleasant feeling of being in on a secret , a new kinship with beauty , or a bit of magic , probing into the minds of the audience would add up to bad manners or worse . Facial expressions and body language surely gave some indication , during the presentation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener will take away is natural and a worthy desire , but what lingers with the listener , what accrues to the child or adult , is of a personal nature . It is the right of listeners to feel pain with the characters who suffer , to share indignation with them as well as the glory of achievement and success . This is true participation . In the sharing of these emotions , the listeners have gone deep into their own lives . Some have felt compassion for the first time , and are struggling to give this feeling a name . Others may have partially left the story scene , looking into their own frustrations ; to have entered the intimate world of problem-solving . These reactions can only be shared with a storyteller and a group through an honest " thank you " or a mild exclamation of pleasure . Some of the audience , however , may leave humming a bit of a song used in the story , or repeating a snatch of rhyme , or a melodic or amusing phrase . Through these actions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was heard and relished , and that an indescribable impression had been made . But the storyteller should ask no questions . Responses will be written on the faces of the group as it makes its way to the exit , and at this moment , plainly described , is the evidence of the speaker 's success or sentence . One can hope that the listeners will reflect some inner light that points up new-found knowledge , new solutions , or pleasure . This richness in expression is far greater than a coerced and badly executed sketch of Rapunzel as she lets down her hair or a drawing of Little Red Riding Hood skipping // through the forest ( with or without the wolf ) . Why do some storytellers request concrete evidence that children have shared stories with them ? Storytellers seldom ask adult audiences to react to a story program unless a request has been made , and time has been arranged , for an exchange of ideas stimulated by the material . When the story has been a selection from fulllength books  --  for example A Separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pony and Travels with Charley , and Henry Roth 's Call It Sleep  --  the audience may be eager to discuss the serious issues raised . Unless the plan has been to conclude the session with questions , answers , and a general discussion , the speaker should talk only with the small number who may care to remain after the program . If it is convenient , an informal period could be shared . The storyteller should neither expect nor demand comments . Neither should the storyteller become involved with one or two members of the group to the exclusion of others who may have wanted the opportunity to talk . If any one wants to stay for further talk , he or she may be invited to do so at the discretion of the speaker . Listeners may wish to know the titles of some additional books similar to the ones from which the stories have been taken , and the speaker may provide a short list prepared in anticipation of such a request . However , a pleasant good night and a thank you are always proper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held in a library or a bookstore , where books may be available , a selection of titles may be arranged for circulation or for purchase . The usual practice of having available copies of the titles used is not always sound . If there are few copies and the assembly is large , these should not be handed over to the first listener who may scramble to secure one for home reading . When possible , copies of the material may be put in an easily accessible place to aid the staff at a charge-out point . Arrangement to reserve copies in demand may be implemented if there are time and staff . Since it is not good business ethics to advertise a product that can not be supplied , a storyteller should not select a story program of material , if at least a part of it can not be duplicated from among the holdings of the sponsoring agency . // Whatever the occasion , the purpose of the story program will control what , if anything , is to follow the stories . Although it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment , sometimes the very nature of the material itself will call for additional activity . When a story has been told only to acquaint the listeners with the plot , in order that creative dramatics may be enjoyed , the children are prepared to continue , moving with ease into another expression of the arts . The story presentation in this instance is not true storytelling , but an experience in creative dramatics with , of course , a story involved . The adviser should be sensitive to the wishes of the group , and one should adhere closely to the arranged plans since they are the guide that has been accepted by the participants , their parents , or whoever may be also concerned with arrangements . Also , an audience having just heard a story presentation in the regular pattern may also wish to act out the story . Here again , the adult in charge makes the decision . At the conclusion of a story to a school group , in a classroom , the storyteller ( guest , librarian , teacher ) should not leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson . The recitation of poetry , when such activity falls within the context of a similar situation , has often been associated with a growing dislike of poetry for many . Listening to stories should be kept separate from any activity that may follow . A period set aside for free expression , as an extension of a story and its creation in another art form could be enjoyable and worthwhile , but if in truth a free time is what is expected , it should remain just that . Any follow-up such as a reproduction of the plot in any form should be continued only if clamored for by the listeners . Even young children may want to talk about a story they have enjoyed . Lucky is the teacher or librarian who meets often enough with the same children or adults to have learned preferences at such a moment . Experimentation with free periods is of inestimable value to all , and the results that come unsolicited are superbly satisfying . In a public library situation what follows a story hour may be another story , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading at home . Whatever activity may be planned , to demand response is unforgivable. // An opportunity to visit with other participants in the program may be offered , especially if a small snack is to be given or a social hour is planned . Adults enjoy chatting together , why not children ? Signing a guestbook may be fun , jI too . The period after the story may be profitably used by issuing an invitation to browse in the library , to ask questions about borrowing , to seek answers to reference questions , or to receive information on other services offered . When this type of activity is initiated , it is easy to understand why it is necessary that the storyteller be familiar with the sponsoring agency and its facilities . It is obvious that guest storytellers ( or volunteers ) , unless they are trained , can not function with assurance in answering library-related questions . Attention may be called to a sign announcing the next story hour ; the group may be reminded of it as they finally leave the story room . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodding to become a borrower or to participate in any specific activity . Hearing the story may be the only thing the listener came for . A sincere invitation to return is enough for a first-timer . Listeners will be quick to ask for borrowers ' cards when this is the purpose of the visit . Sometimes a group of first-timers may become so exuberant , or so intrigued with themselves , that when the presentation is over , they will press for special attention . One storyteller accepted such an episode as a challenge to deal with an unspoken  --  but obvious  --  call for help . She asked the gang to remain after the others had gone and suggested that since they were older than the regular audience , and that they had different interests ( diplomatic lady ) , perhaps they would like their own program . How would they like to form a club ? She had guessed correctly ; the kids agreed with alacrity . They returned , talked it over , organized a weekly , evening storytime for young adults ( they were all teen-age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular time for meeting , and the club lasted until the children 's librarian was transferred to another branch library . These young men were mostly foreign-born , living in the inner city . They not only listened to stories , but they wanted to sharpen their language skills , become citizens , and at the same time to reminisce about their native countries . Another similar disruptive crowd decided when invited to form a club and to write their own stories . The storyteller welcomed them as young writers , and the library staff // encouraged their efforts as " reporters " of the news in the community surrounding the library . A trip to the largest local newspaper was organized , and for a while these youngsters published their own mimeographed news sheet . The story hour in public libraries may be the source of new ideas for activities for several age groups or for out-reach projects that can make friends for the library , and may become core groups for initiating special funding possibilities . The story hour is an important part of the public relations planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be developed to meet many interests . It is difficult sometimes to fathom just what can come from a storytime . Frequently there are separate and very personal reactions to storytelling long after the story experience . One afternoon , standing on a curb at a busy intersection in a large Midwestern city , a storyteller was greeted by a youngster who said , " Tell it again ! " Through some miracle , the storyteller knew exactly what the lad had in mind . She stood on the corner with the late afternoon traffic whirling past and repeated the " double talk " that comes at the end of " Master of All Masters . " The youngster grinned , nodded his head up and down , thanked her , and melted into the crowd . Again , a young housewife and mother , being introduced to a storyteller grown older , said , " Oh , I remember you ! " After a moment she continued , " I remember your voice . You used to tell stories at my school . I 'll never forget them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a television series for school children , stopped in the middle of an interview and planning session , sat very still , and exclaimed , " Now , I know who you are . No wonder I wanted to do a series of programs on literature . You were the one who told stories to us . It was you who helped me understand how nature influences people . Come on . You 're just the person we need to help put on this show ! " Storytellers sparkle as they tell how the friendly teasing of technicians and camera men have changed to respectful listening , as a structured radio or television story program has progressed from a trial performance to a sustaining show . All this is reminiscent of the child who skips down the hall , away from story hour repeating bits of Millions of Cats . 2 No storyteller need push for praise , nor should feel a need to question a listener . Hearing stories is an emotional experience , and one 's reaction is as personal , as pri " ... Lived // vate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners do n't know what they think . They may not feel they are supposed to think anything at that moment . They may want time to mull over the sensation of a burgeoning imagination . Was it not enough that a story was told and shared ? The apprentice storyteller should be encouraged to imagine all the positive experiences a listener may receive from a storytime . Students should know there are several benefits : listeners learn a new story ( and are given a glimpse of good literature ) , their perception of proportion is quickened , their concept of the fitness of things is deepened , and perhaps even they become more alert . They may have had their first lesson , via the plot , in sequential logic . They may have started to see the meanings of names of things , of people or been encouraged toward more self-esteem . Best of all is when through stories the first steps are taken to identify oneself as a real person . A true surge of happiness is possible simply in being part of a group , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being involved . Although the signal purpose of the story remains entertainment , the listener may have come to realize that there is good and evil ; that it is a privilege to choose one or the other . Shakespeare 's description of the casket scene in The Merchant of Venice ( Act II , Scene viii ) had a lasting influence on a high school student who said that until the moment she read the scene she had wondered if there were any virtue in choice . A small child heard of this scene first from one who told the tale from the Lambs ' interpretation of the play . That child , when she grew up and went to Venice , could have no peace until she relived the story of the play and walked on the Rialto , imaging the several characters all about her . She thought once more of Belmont , wondering where it had been . Chapter Eight THE GREAT DESIGNERS In the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh , there is a painting by Chalmers entitled The Legend . This work by a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greens , and reds , portrays a spacious room with stone walls and a low hearth with hints of a fire . Seated to the left , in a chair carved from dark woods , is the storyteller . Her left hand is extended in a slight gesture toward the eight boys and girls grouped in a ragged crescent before her . One child , propped by his arms , lies on the floor ; a girl sits relaxed on a low stool . The canvas depicts many aspects of the story experience , but only through suggestion can it reveal all the problems that faced the early designers of a return to this literary adventure for children , the story hour . Other than knowledge of the needs of boys and girls and an abundant enthusiasm , these librarians had little with which to build . Few collections of stories for children were being published , and there were few librarians trained to speak in public . On the other hand , there were Andersen , the Grimm brothers , Jacobs , Pyle , and Stockton . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Mary Wright Plummer , director of the School of Library Science at the Pratt Institute , Brooklyn , at a storytelling session presented by an Englishwoman , Marie L. Shedlock , in the elegant ballroom at Sherry 's , in New York City , set the modern course of storytelling in the United States . Shedlock found avid listeners and learners among the teachers and librarians , nation-wide , who heard her tell the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and attended her classes in storytelling . They made her welcome , and they kept her busy . Mary Plummer invited Shedlock to Brooklyn and hear-68 // ing her there were two who could never forget : Anne Carroll Moore and Anna Cogswell Tyler . Although Moore was not a storyteller , it was she who was to be the spark that lit the story-hour candle for all time : she invited Marie Shedlock to the Pratt Children 's Room , and later to the New York Public Library ; she appointed Tyler the New York Public 's first head of storytelling . After Moore had heard Shedlock tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a regular part of the service to young borrowers . 1 She considered storytelling a most important answer to youth 's needs to share literature , and she soon discovered that it could lead to friendships between adults and children . Learning of Shedlock 's visit to the United States , Alice M. Jordan invited her to tell stories in Boston and arranged for her to direct demonstrations and workshops . 2 As head of children 's services for the Boston Public Library , and later as book editor of The Horn Book Magazine , Jordan was , at the turn of the century , already exploring new services for children . She possessed great vision and was perhaps the first librarian to recognize the siren call of movies , and to know that story hours should be as much fun as films in order to compete . While Marie Shedlock contributed the pattern of what should take place during a story hour  --  a carefully selected , well-told story  --  and Moore added the air of festival and delineated its purpose , it was Jordan who understood the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a decade after Shedlock 's visit the Boston Public was offering three superior storytellers to its young patrons . They were Mrs. Mary Cronan , her husband , John Cronan , and her sister , Mrs. Margaret Powers , and for thirty years these three storytellers would influence the boys and girls growing up in that city . Sara Cone Bryant , 3 writer , anthologist , and storyteller , was also invited to Boston by Jordan in the early 1900 's . Bryant was adapting old folktales and writing , and her How to Tell Stories to Children , published by Houghton Mifflin in 1905 , was perhaps the first book to give definite instructions on how to proceed as a storyteller. 4 Although Bryant 's instructional work is no longer used extensively , many of the stories she wrote and those she a70 The Story Experience dapted are preserved in collections and anthologies . Such stories as " The Little Red Hen " and " The Gingerbread Boy " were among her tales for the youngest listeners . She was one of the first writers to suggest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce a bit of mystery , and the need . for long stories to be edited for brevity . Bryant 's works were followed in 1915 by Marie Shedlock 's The Art of the Story-teller , 5 which was to become the most honored writing on traditional storytelling for many decades , influencing generations of storytellers . This book is a compilation of her lectures , suggestions , and choice stories , and includes a chapter containing questions teachers had asked and the answers she gave . The third edition ( see Bibliography ) is a greater and richer volume since it carries a Foreword by Anne Carroll Moore , and " A New List of Stories " contributed by Eulalie Steinmetz Ross who was herself a librarian and one of the truly great storytellers . Each selection included is proof of the faithfulness of Ross 's desire and promise to include only those stories that Shedlock might have selected herself . These items reflect the skill of Ross and her deep devotion to the storytelling ethic . Also in the list of early created aids for storytellers are Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's A Handbook of Children 's Literature , which was used as one of the first textbooks in courses in children 's literature and storytelling . Although the space devoted specifically to storytelling was minimal , the Handbook authors explored the subject of " re-creative " storytelling . They give credit to Miss A. J. Latham of Teachers College , Columbia University , for having coined the phrase . 6 It may also have been Latham who influenced Eloise Ramsey to rethink the value of memorizing material for story hours . It is interesting to note that one of Ramsey 's first students remembers that she required memorization in the preparation of stories while one of her later students remembers that she insisted on the use of the recreative method . This method , still a favorite , stresses study of the story until mental pictures of the action , in sequence , can be formed and blended with the rhythm of the author 's style and language . Another of the earliest designers of storytelling was Lucy Sprague Mitchell who was experimenting in New York City with young children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area of children 's stories that // related to their small world : their bodies , toys , families , and friends . Her 1921 Here and Now Story Book , a collection of stories about this child 's world , was to make a great impact upon both instructors and students in teacher-training institutions throughout the United States . In 1948 she revised the volume , noting that the changing world had caused her to refurbish her original volume and to update certain objects that appeared in the early life of a child . Also prominent on the New York scene were Mary Gould Davis and Ruth Sawyer who were to become master storytellers . Their rich backgrounds in reading , travel , and folklore ; their flawless skill in selection and powerful presentation set the highest standards for apprentice storytellers and inspired them to emulation . Davis followed Anna Cogswell Tyler as supervisor of storytelling at the New York Public in 1922 , and in 1930 published a collection of her own story-hour favorites , A Baker 's Dozen . Ruth Sawyer 's The Way of the Storyteller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published in 1962 . This volume , in either edition , is accorded by storytellers a reverence second only to that given Shedlock 's famous old book by which it stands on the shelves of most libraries . Through her writings and her long ministry  --  perhaps the most compelling of any artist in the field of storytelling  --  she gave and still gives reassurance to storytellers who may be wavering in their loyalty to the traditionally told story in a world steeped in visual entertainment . Sawyer also wrote award-winning fiction for children , and wrote and collected some of the choice stories being told today . It is hoped that with the rekindling of the oral tradition for children that the tales included in her book The Long Christmas will become more easily available . The Midwest blazed its own trail early in the new century ; the most active of these early notable storytellers were Gudrun Thorne-Thomsen , writer and storyteller from Norway , working first in the Chicago area and then in California ; Carolyn Burnite in Cleveland , and Frances Jenkins Olcott and Edna Whiteman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lecturer , and storyteller . She still exerts great influence , more // than twenty years after her death , upon storytellers through the magnificent recordings she made of some of her story presentations . In Detroit , there was an especially enthusiastic group of storytellers . The Detroit Public Library 's Children 's Department , under the direction of first Elizabeth Knapp and then Jessie Tompkins , brought together librarians who had no other thought than that storytelling was one of the first rights and privileges of both children and children 's librarians . Tompkins was an innovator : she saw the value of regularly scheduled story hours and she appreciated the need for the staff to be well-trained . Too , she saw early the need to offer experiences for her storytellers in various environments and sent them into the schools to tell stories . She made opportunities for them to learn the use of radio as a second storytelling medium . She also suggested , and supported , the first fumbling efforts in the creation of preschool story programs . The first story hour of this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frances E. Burnside , the head of children 's services there , as observers . Later , Tompkins supervised a more structured program that was to be most successful and replicated in many schools and libraries . Like Anne Carroll Moore , Tompkins did not tell stories , but encouraged her staff to high levels of expertise in the art of selection and the skill and grace of presentation . She held meetings at which the librarians could listen to and learn from each other . While the librarians told stories , listened and learned , Tompkins studied them all ! Newcomers were invited to tell specific tales , often from the folklore of their native areas . Among the storytellers in this gifted , experienced group were Burnside , Hazel Adams Richardson , Elizabeth B. Ulveling , Ruth Hoey , and Miriam Wessel . Through the years most of these librarians have continued to tell stories professionally and to be prominent as lecturers and instructors in this field . In the far West Wilhelmina Harper , in Redwood City , California , was actively telling stories , serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of her collections , especially those prepared for use at holiday times , are still in print . The West Coast was splendidly represented also by Ella Young , who was from Ireland . Young was a superb storyteller and considered by many , as was Ruth Sawyer , " the storyteller 's storyteller. " // It was storytellers like Davis and Sawyer and Young who through their gifts as folklorists , speakers , scholars , and writers exemplified the best in the art , and through their very devotion to and belief in the oral tradition were able to entice others into this special profession . Frances Clarke Sayers brought the world up-to-date . on Ella Young through her review of Young 's autobiography , The Flowering Dusk , 7 for The Horn Book Magazine , in May , 1945 . In 1972 , Sayers brought the world of storytelling in touch with another of its earliest designers in the rich , personal biography , Anne Carroll Moore . Not only with her writings does Sayers reinforce the need for stories and storyteller , but through her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyteller of wide experience and charm . In Summoned by Books , she underlines the importance of purity , strength , scholarship , and purpose in the art of the storyteller . She stresses the need for dedication in those who serve children , in her long-famous " Lose Not the Nightingale , " 8 that was to librarians an irresistible voice directing them not only to the choosing of the best in children 's literature , but to the best in all ramifications of library work with the young : an instrument with which to measure themselves as professionals and persons . Storytelling is recognized by Frances Clarke Sayers as the staunch ally of the good and the great in literature , and she wrote that for the child who found it difficult to read , storytelling gave an equal share in the literary heritage through the spoken word ; that storytelling is the means of taking the books of first quality to a wider audience than those who might find them on their own . 9 Sayers ' belief that the essential quality of childhood does not change should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pressures of mass communication , comics , and television are draining away potential listeners . She reassures them that for all the distractions there remains the mind of the child , hungry for experiences and full of a sense of wonder . 10 Also influential in training children 's librarians and storytellers in the West were Winifred Crosley in Michigan and Elizabeth Burr in Wisconsin . Crosley was the producer of the first important film on storytelling , " Art of Telling Stories to Children . // In the South , Nora Beust , professor of children 's literature at the University of North Carolina , and later the first consultant for children 's services at the national level , was among the first instructors in library schools to include lectures and laboratory periods in storytelling in the courses of study for children 's librarians . Anthologies and collections of stories also began to include some instruction in the art , and the growth and popularity of storytelling stimulated authors , and collectors , to prepare volumes of stories found to be successful . Two folklorists who edited collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherlock . Chase published two volumes , The Jack Tales and Grandfather Tales , that were to influence preceptively the selection of stories for telling in the South for at least twenty-five years . These stories , discovered among the Southern mountain areas , especially North Carolina , were similar to the folktales of Europe . Since they were " homespun "  --  and those telling them were so charming using the native dialect and accent  --  it was difficult for instructors in storytelling to introduce what they considered purer versions of these old tales . While many teachers and librarians working near the counties where Chase explored will never be convinced , some storytellers are beginning to realize that there are other stories ! One of the favorites among Chase 's selections is " Sody Sallyraytus , " 12 and it has become popular in many regions of the United States . Sir Philip M. Sherlock of Jamaica added to the Anansi tales his collection entitled Anansi , the Spider Man , West Indian versions of the doings of the wily African hero . Anansi , a favorite with authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past twenty years . One of the latest offerings is Carol Korty 's Plays from African Folktales that offers four plays , two of which are about Anansi . Those storytellers who enjoy dramatizing stories with children will be helped by the author 's suggestions and notes on costuming and special effects . It was more than excellent writings , workshops , and formal classes in storytelling , however , that assured a renaissance in the art . The festival of stories held at Miami Beach during the American Library Association conference in June 1956 was one of the most significant events in the history of storytelling in the United States since the advent of Marie Shedlock . Master storytellers were honored with tales // told with special ceremonial grace . Stories written by Ruth Sawyer and adaptations of Andersen , written by Shedlock , were presented , and many librarians witnessed these occasions . The event was important because of its purpose and content , and for its celebration of the art . Too , it wrote the final paragraphs of the first chapter of the modern story of storytelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the challenge had been made . At the festivities on Tuesday , June 19th , the day dedicated to Mary Gould Davis , the first storyteller introduced was Augusta Baker . As she was presented some of the audience saw and heard , for the first time , the new leader-tobe . Baker is perhaps the one greatest force in the furtherance of storytelling throughout the country . Augusta Baker is widely known as a master storyteller , and she is honored often for her artistry and leadership . She is a designer of workshops and lecture series ; she continues to write and to record , to inspire , and , gently to remind those in authority to maintain and to enrich the story experience . With children and parents demanding a return of the oral tradition to schools and libraries , it is evident that she has told her story well . She has kept the faith . Others felt the need to speak up for storytelling and to document its impressive history , and these writings gave prominence to the beginning of the second chapter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1950 's was Charles Laughton with his article in the Atlantic Monthly . In 1956 Gudrun Thorne-Thomsen wrote Storytelling and Stories I Tell , and Jasmine Britton wrote in an article for The Horn Book Magazine the story of this outstanding educator and storyteller . Spencer Shaw wrote an article about his experimentation with stories and music , and in 1959 , Ruth Tooze published her book , Storytelling . Each of these significant writings portrayed changes and hinted at new trends : the passing of the great traditional storytellers , beginnings of variations in the structured toldtale , and the need for the emergence of additional leaders to take the messages nation-wide . Ruth Tooze did this through her teaching , lecturing , // and writings . She was a superb storyteller , and her art reflected her knowledge of children and young adults , her understanding of how children learn , her travels , and especially , her masterful use of the dramatic flair . In North Carolina , even before Tooze went there to live , write , and lecture , Mary Peacock Douglas , supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known library administrator and library technologist , was encouraging librarians to place emphasis upon storytelling . She arranged for many special programs that brought popular authors and storytellers to her state . She also presented a specialist to introduce the value of radio-storytelling in taking folklore to a wide audience . Although she did not tell stories , she read to children and adults , and a favorite with her listeners was Something for the Medicine Man . 13 Others in the South who influenced and enlarged the scope of storytelling as an institutional service were two library administrators : Mary Louise Rheay , director of Children 's Services at the Atlanta Public Library , and Pauline Griffin , at the Department of Continuing Education at the University of Georgia in Athens . They offered teachers and librarians many opportunities to attend clinics , workshops , and tell-ins for storytellers . The 1960 's saw continued homage paid to the first great storytellers , and Ruth Sawyer was encouraged to restudy and enlarge her book , The Way of the Storyteller . One of the most valuable and practical essays on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who included it as a carefully written postscript to her The Lost Half-Hour , a collection of story-hour favorites . Eileen Colwell , an English librarian-storyteller , published a pair of titles : A Storyteller 's Choice and A Second Storyteller 's Choice  --  each with helpful notes and instructions . Elizabeth Hough Sechrist and Jeanne B. Hardendorft were still adding to their long lists of compilations ( see Bibliography ) . Virginia Haviland 's Ruth Sawyer was published in 1965 , and continued the story of this gifted writer and teller of tales . Sawyer 's My Spain : A Storyteller 's Year of Collecting came in 1967 . In 1966 " The Pleasure Is Mutual , " a film demonstrating the picture storybook program , was produced and created a renewed interest in sharing books with the young child . // Anne Izard , **35;327;TOOLONG in Westchester County , New York was featured , and her techniques were highly influential through the country . Although there was much experimentation through multimedia programs centering around games , singing , and puppetry , the oral tradition was still prominent among services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club meetings , and were busy at holidays . It was , however , the blossoming of the picture book time , and more and more young children were being given the lion 's share of the librarians ' attention . With the late 1960 's and ' 70 's there appeared a wealth of new material in Anne Pellowski 's The World of Children 's Literature , May Hill Arbuthnot 's Time for Old Magic , and a new edition of the Anthology of Children 's Literature . 14 Traditionalists were given reinforcement through the section on " Storytelling " that appears as a part of the Appendix in this latter volume . Public libraries continued to structure and to sponsor training sessions for storytellers , and classes in children 's literature allotted several days , or longer , to lectures on the art . Professional storytellers were invited to share their stories and expertise . Among the students were bright young librarians-to-be who were well aware of the challenge of radio and television to the storyteller . One of these was Eleanor Hawkins , who created the first commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Greensboro , around 1950 . Later , from New Bern in the same state , she produced a similar program that has been continuously popular for many years . Two other leaders who encouraged storytelling and the study of folklore were Diane Wolkstein working in New York City and Gwenda Ledbetter in Asheville , North Carolina . Wolkstein was making recordings , writing , and serving as a storyteller , lecturer , and producer of a radio story hour . She also appeared as keynote speaker for seminars on folklore and storytelling in various areas of the country . Ledbetter is one of the true professionals : sheds tireless , willing to tell stories for hours , and her repertoire is endless . She worked with the children in Buncombe County and appeared in a television series entitled " Tales from the Red Rocker . " Completely at ease with both material and au78 The Story Experience dience , Ledbetter ranks with Davis and Sawyer in her mastery of the art . Her telling of " The Nightingale " by Andersen leaves one with the clear sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of the bird as he sang in the green woods . It is surprising that the 1970 's brought so few programs having stories central to their format to radio and television . Equally unexpected , but cheering and reassuring , was the large number of superior studies made and reported in this decade . One of the most helpful books on telling stories to young children was a revision of Vardine Moore 's Pre-School Story Hour . Zena Sutherland revised May Hill Arbuthnot 's ... Anthology of Children 's Literature , 15 and Sylvia Ziskind published her Telling Stories to Children . Sutherland also brought out the fifth edition of Children and Books , and Caroline Feller Bauer produced her Handbook for Storytellers . This volume considers many aspects of communicating with children through books , and it is one of the few recent publications to discuss the use of mass media . Together with Ellin Greene , Augusta Baker released Storytelling , Art and Technique , and here one can find reminiscences of the beginnings of storytelling in schools and libraries in the United States , a factual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful suggestions for a successful continuance of the art . With the publication of The World of Storytelling , Anne Pellowski launched the third epoch of the art , skillfully bringing together the last pieces of the puzzle that have been eluding folklorists and institutional storytellers for years : the reconciliation of the many forms of folklore . Her scholarly and definitive work is a major contribution that can round out the reading background of storytellers around the world . By taking advantage of the rich resources created for storytellers , other teachers and librarians have also helped to fashion the dignified presentation and exchange of literature with boys and girls through the art of storytelling . The list of men and women who have created blissful afternoons and evenings of sprites and spirits , talking aniThe // mals and fairyfolk , is long , and often their art is unsung . So , light the candles and declare festival for those who have recognized the need of girls and boys to hear stories ; to be aware of the gripping literary heritage that is rightfully theirs . Chapter Nine THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate elegance storytelling probably should be presented to potential storytellers ( in order to get their attention and support ) as being as easy as " A B C. " Perhaps one could be tempted to say that to maintain the nature and the spirit of the art is as simple as the plot of " The Three Bears . " The storyteller will discover , however , that this particular nursery tale is most complex . To recall , for telling , more than the basic pattern is difficult without a quick look at the story itself . This " simple " story should be easily found anywhere , one supposes . The storyteller goes to a prominent listing of good storybook titles with helpful notes and brief annotations . Mildly amused , the searcher finds that also acceptable as the title is " The Story of the Three Bears . " One entry is reported as being " The Story of the Three Little Bears , " but further study of the volume in which this odd title is said to occur shows that the title has been entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same story  --  or would she ? More confusion is encountered when there is a sprinkling of " see also 's " but no " see 's , " and it becomes obvious that the editors have thrown up their hands . Decisions , decisions . One hastens to locate the various volumes containing this tale  --  and one decides that , first , one selection from the several versions must be chosen . Probably with surprise the storyteller learns that Robert Southey is credited as the author of the story . A folktale with one author ? Many say yes , and please , not to look too far to disprove the fact since this poet laureate of England , who wrote so diligently for so long  --  there are fourteen volumes of poetry and more to his credit  --  is probably better known for writing " The Story of the Three Bears " than for anything else he ever wrote  --  including 80 // an excellent biography of Lord Nelson and the well-known poem , " The Battle of Blenheim . " The searcher , now at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer used but that it may be found in several well-known collections , and that he is named . as having written it . But he did n't write it , says yet newer information  --  not first , anyway . With the explorer 's curiosity and zeal , one forges on : to find that , no , he never said he wrote it . The malcontent then goes to the honored source of Joseph Jacobs , l and learns that some of the mystery has been cleared up . But Jacobs has dug up a second version that he includes in yet another collection of English tales where he gives the story a new title , " Scrapefoot . " The plot quickens . A fox has been substituted for Southey 's old naughty woman and the later American-English Goldilocks , and now there is a third contender ( besides Jacobs ' " Little , Small , Wee Bear " ) for the porridge . This is more like it . Here is a real folktale : a beast tale  --  all animals , pure and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynard ! Deeper and deeper into the woods of folklore one goes : it seems now to be the Middle Ages , but no . One is precipitated into Oriental literature , then Aesop , up through Chaucer ( the old familiar borrower and friend ) , himself . One leaps ahead a few hundreds of years and finds that the satirizing of society is involved ; that the bears are not always bears , but sometimes wolves ; that the enemy is really human , thieving , lying , and more than mischievous . The monastic pen is put aside and then it is printing which spreads the confusion . The lion , cat , and badger are introduced as victims or near-victims . In 1250 a clerk named Willem is supposed to have donated his skills to the story and to have come up with a Flemish version . Before this time , however , in the twelfth century there is said to have been Latin and German texts . As early as the thirteenth century , the French had produced the Roman de Renart . This version may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was Chaucer 's " The Nun 's Priest 's Tale . " In 1481 , William Caxton printed an English translation of a Flemish manuscript , and much later in 1919 , John Masefield published his long poem , " Reynard the Fox , " giving it a modern treatment . With this information spread out for perusal , one hears // a whisper of disbelief : a manuscript in the Osborne Collection of the Toronto Public Library , entitled " The Story of the Three Bears , " metrically related , with illustrations , had been presented originally as a birthday gift to one Horace Broke , September 26 , 18312  --  six years before Southey published his account in the fourth volume of The Doctor . This new evidence casts some doubt on Southey 's original authorship ( which he never claimed ) , but Jacobs wrote that a metrical version by a " G. N. , " introducing little " Silverhair , " had been much praised by Southey . So , one can hardly give Eleanor Mure , the giver of the birthday gift , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place is a good telling of the story that could refresh the memory of a favorite tale . A study of several versions ( there are almost as many as there are writers and storytellers involved with this bit of folklore ) leads the hunter through the change from pots of porridge to bowls ; from an old vixen of a woman to a fox ; from " Silverhair " to " Goldilocks " ; through a variety of sympathies , or lack of them , on the part of follow-up artists and authors . To cut short the chase one would do well to choose the telling by Flora Annie Steel . It is disconcerting , however , to learn therein that there was no " Mama Bear . " The " middle-sized bear " is referred as a male . L. Leslie Brooke came to the rescue in his 1934 The Story of the Three Bears , referring to the characters as " Poppa Bear , " " Momma Bear , " and " Baby Bear . " 3 Also , Gruenberg twenty years later refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " her " bowl.4 The folktale process is typified in the story of the Story of the Three Bears . That tale 's history is not yet complete . Each storyteller may have to write a new version , but this is the way it should be to exhibit , through individual creativity , true folktale development . Winner of the race the storyteller is not , but along the way some enlightening information about Robert Southey has been uncovered , and , most glorious of all , one feels rewarded for learning that Leonardo da Vinci wrote fables : that he wrote of the fox , and that his fox was clever ; that Leonardo , using Aesop and other writers of the earliest times , originated new beast tales by endowing the animals with human traits that matched those of the people in his own life . Everyone should rejoice at learning that Robert Southey wrote " Snips and snails and puppy dog tails .... " He also wrote " Sugar and spice and all things nice . " Or did he ? 5 // As a folktale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has firmly entrenched itself , and happily so , in the lives of countless millions . ( Recently a poignant story appeared that demonstrates the influence of this nursery tale upon at least one very special child seeking security and love . 6 ) Studying its history as a story would seem to require a lifetime . As recently as 1976 , Paul Galdone 's The Three Bears created a new " Goldilocks " who is missing a front tooth . Storytelling is many things , and its meanings and interpretations are as disparate as the personal discoveries and convictions of the blind men who touched the elephant . 7 Storytelling covers much ancient and modern literature as well as various media of presentation . It marries well with persons of all nationalities and all ages . It lives harmoniously with art and music . It is the companion of the writer , the composer , the actor , the puppeteer , and the public speaker . Interpretation , as well as definition , is as varied as all the persons who touch its world ; its many facets have attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the future of all the races of earth . A story is real , it is fantasy , but its great stretches are sometimes fraught with fallacy . It often represents dilemmas ; it harbors mistaken ideas . It is eternally changing . Storytelling presupposes a central figure or figures , content/plot , a medium of communication , a speaker , and an audience . To talk of its utility is to denigrate the stature of a story ; the meaning and influence of all folk-based tales can hardly be measured . An examination of the goals set by a central figure may elicit a treatise on the subject , but any attempt to bend a story , to attribute to it or its central character false virtues , is in itself unseemly . One would do well to examine one 's motives when it would seem that storytelling needs a defense or a reason for existing : beware the " use " of storytelling in the classroom or as a " stimulus " to " motor " responses h la the psychologists , or talk of its beneficence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstractions and limitless powers . A story is a reflection of the hearer him or herself ; it just may be that because of its elusiveness and its impalpability , it can accomplish all it is often credited with ; but to push it to those ends can be to mistreat it . // Structured programs involving tellable material do create salutary situations  --  but so do unstructured occasions . Is storytelling only palliative ? a narcotic ? an analgesic ? Is it only grandparents , parents , and children ? Is it a means of transmittal of a heritage ? Is it a folklorist telling anecdotes ? One sure question to be answered is , how well prepared may an individual be to accept and to enjoy his or her verbal legacy ? All the facets of the oral tradition are brought into the search for answers to these several questions  --  the storyteller , the writer , the scholars , reference sources , collections of materials and audiences . It is comforting to know that the heritage is being preserved by the caretakers of the art . At times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any source of pleasure , any avenue to identification with such a cohesive power as a joint heritage , should be studied . With the value of the storytelling art beyond doubt , it should be refurbished by those in need of its power . If indeed there has been a diminution in the United States in the practice of the oral tradition , it behooves those most closely associated with it to play their roles with greater dedication . The desire should be to increase not only the storytellers ' own personal skills but their commitments . It is true there has been a series of educational pressures that have changed the nature of the traditional story hour in both content and structure  --  as well as purpose . While the art remains unblemished , its popularity has been questioned , and practice of the art has decreased in schools and libraries . Large numbers of people are being reached by some form of story program , but there is a decided shift in the variety of age levels in the audiences . A greater number of young children than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed materials with opportunities for verbal and motor activities . A return to a consideration in depth of the meaning and the value of the art , and a rethinking of the total community as audience ( not only the very youngest child and the senior citizen )  --  with equal opportunities for all would-be listeners  - -  would easily correct any discrimination that may be present in the contemporary scheme . A recognition of its true role in culture transmission ought to place the told-story back in perspective . The community itself of course is central to storyThe // telling . Actually , everyone practices his or her share of tale-telling : in stores , on the streets , in classes , in gatherings of all kinds , . organized and otherwise . Funds at several governmental levels represented in the local community are being allocated and spent to promote ( in a small way , true ) most of the arts , and schools and libraries contribute their expertise and support . Institutions of higher learning are affording facilities for continuing education and for lectureship series and there is governmental direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and newsletter space are provided and information such as lists of resource people and notices of opportunities for artists of all kinds are available in many locations in a community ( the library , the high school , the college , city hall ) . The community needs only to be stimulated to greater effort  --  which should then be redoubled based on firsthand experience of the awe-inspiring returns on effort invested . Writers , artists , and publishers are offering more and more sources for the study and selection of stories in the oral tradition . Colleges and universities are acquiring appropriate publications and professional collectors are busy bringing together various original documents for scholars who are still searching , comparing , and validating their finds . Agencies created for educational and social services to children and adults  --  and churches and synagogues  --  are obvious sources of influence on a community 's attunement to the value of the storytelling tradition . Centers of religious education serve as distributors of information ; they provide a climate and a particularly valuable meeting place for the sharing of literature . Free-lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn shaped by it , for whatever their particular fields , their livelihoods generally come directly ( or indirectly ) from some governmental source , as do those of most teachers and librarians . Colleges and universities not only serve as depositories for the precious books bearing the written tale , but they are primarily responsible for the professional training of storytellers : the continuation of the art so long delegated to the guilds in the neighborhoods of long ago . While colleges and universities were , and are , eager to bring together speakers on folklore and to provide occasions for the informal sharing // of literature , it is possible that they have been remiss in another area of their responsibility to the oral tradition . Their departments of speech and of graduate studies in education and library science have allowed the idea to grow that storytelling should not necessarily be a part of the courses of study for teachers and librarians . Boards of trustees should not be held responsible for their failure to consider storytelling a skill necessary to the job performance of teachers and librarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be meted out to faculties who are knowledgeable of the importance of the oral tradition and yet do not provide for its instruction . Institutions of higher learning are however struggling nowadays to embrace the new worries created by changing times , and it is , sadly , possible that but few potential professionals in any field or discipline are currently receiving superior training . Teachers and media specialists in public schools during the past twenty years have also been besieged by a series of circumstances that precluded their continuing to practice any gentle art regardless of their training or intuition . Fear of the scientific prowess of competing nations turned the attention of the United States toward science and research in technologies , not toward art and literature . Federal funds became available for library-related materials and some equipment , but only in a few instances did these funds cover hiring adequate personnel to administer the enhanced collections of audiovisual and other hardware items . It has been , therefore , difficult in the United States to maintain the degree of excellence desired in the fields for which these items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to turn full attention to the writing of sci/tech-related project proposals , the perusal of new genres of catalog , and the acquisitioning of an endless list of paraphernalia ( whose contents , or nature , often remained a mystery ) . There was little time for previewing or proper evaluation before selection ; even less remained for such traditional librarianly duties as finding good stories . Volunteers , acceptably trained or not , had to be welcomed , and later , inadequately-trained aides were pressed into service . The supervision of these willing helpers was time-consuming . The increase of preschool institutions such as day-care centers and kindergartens to care for children // whose parents were both in professions , business , or industry added to the load of teachers and media specialists . They were now expected to perform miracles in supervisory roles helping to train staffs , especially for agencies where children of the ages from one to five were being cared for by government funds . Not only was time at a premium , but the swift changes in materials and the methods necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick aboutface . A shift in emphasis was forced from children to things , and any attempt to acquaint children with their literary heritage seemed to be restricted to recorded , taped , canned , or otherwise factory-made media . Whatever effort that could be made by traditional storytellers began to be influenced by certain deleterious rumors : story materials were difficult to come by , the learning process was long and hard . It was bruited about that some selections  --  such as from Andersen , Kipling , Wilde , Stockton , and Sandburg  --  were too precious to be told ( unless memorized , and this was discouraged )  --  that they should be read so as not to lose any of the art of the writers . The art of these writers sustains itself . It does not allow the learner to want to omit singing phrases , perfect words . These stories were meant to be told and in time anyone who wants to can share them in this most traditional form . Too , the method of committing these literary masterpieces to memory was deemed fraught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that memorization is not so difficult for the younger storytellers as it is for older teachers and librarians . Apprentices should not be discouraged in their planning to become familiar with these superior stories . Perhaps the frightening ingredient is the hard work and not the fear of forgetting . Should only the professional actor and storyteller be encouraged to know the excitement stimulated by these great writers ? There is an old saying , how silent the woods if one could hear the songs of only the sweetest singers . " Too easily have these excuses risen to some lips , and too easy is the defense of those loath to produce the beauty of the told story . Excuses for less and less of the formal story exchange are found at the training level and in some literature written on the subject of storytelling itself . Writers in professional journals also have referred to the lack of // interest on the part of potential audiences . And again , television is often the scapegoat . If it is thought that television is a greater attraction than listening to stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus detrimental to the child and the young adult ) , why are the efforts of training institutions not bent anew toward change ? Instead , it would seem that mere excuses are offered to some would-be apprentices and literary programs lessened in meaningfulness , to others . The training of teachers and librarians who will work with children and their literary needs should include methods and techniques in how to encourage boys and girls not only to learn to read , but to understand the real meaning of the possession of such a skill , and to learn to enjoy the practice of it . Perhaps the greater emphasis and the lion 's share of the funds are misplaced . How one reads is important , but so are that one reads and what . The storyteller influences the skill and the quality , playing a significant role in encouraging the habit of going places where such reading materials may be obtained easily , and free . Excuses are quickly come by : the loss of clientele , the difficulty of the art . These rascally rationalizations have given birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the media specialists and librarians who prefer the variety programs say that these are structured to fit the needs of the young child : to move , to speak , and to touch  --  to participate . These children are also being introduced to literature through recordings , filmstrips , and films . They are learning to identify objects ; to recognize colors ; to know the names of items prominent in their world . They are also becoming acquainted with the delights of music , verse , and puppetry . Traditionalists counter with what they believe to be even more basic : an exercising of the imagination ; the sensing of the enthusiasm and warmth of an adult who is relating to a child on a personal basis through eye contact as well as through the human voice , and its wide range of evocative qualities . Part of the variety program is the sharing of stories through picture books . Here , however , the story is not so important as the artistic interpretations . The barriers cast // by the book and its illustrations are cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the traditionalists ' approach . The mechanics of the turning of the pages and the maneuvers in order for all to see are obvious , and there is little artistry in such a display . The necessity for a child 's being able to see a picture of an object , together with the word ( its name ) , was recognized in the middle of the seventeenth century when John Amos Komensky  --  more familiar to librarians and students as Comenius  --  published his Orbis Sensualium Pictus ( or , just Orbis Pictus ) . It is considered to be the first picture book for children . Illustrations aid in the identification of objects , but the fallacy in the picture-book concept is that few children ever really see anything . This type of program has greater impact when it is presented to only two or three children , and they can actually see well enough to connect the words with the illustrations , and are able to relate the one with the other . If a book is shown to a group of more than three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group-oriented enough to consider the rights of each to view equally and to enjoy the company of each other as much as the material being displayed . When there are more than three or four youngsters , the use of multiple copies of the title , or an opaque projector , should be considered . The picture story program does not appear to be a finished presentation . It is , to the traditionalist , only the first step toward the mastery of a story , or book , by a storyteller who has decided to share a tale before experiencing a oneness with a particular volume . The picture book program had an honorable and altruistic beginning . It was first experimented with to show concern for the individual child . Through the offer to the child of a feeling of closeness and friendship with the children 's librarian , it was hoped that even the youngest patron might feel at home in the public library ; to help these youngsters to be aware of the increasingly large number of " two-laps " books that were being published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing by the child and an older person , with the librarian serving as catalyst to facilitate , through demonstration , the acceptance of such an activity in the home . // These books were also being introduced to small children to instruct them in the care and handling of library materials . As well , the books could assist the children in their assimilation of the fact that words are both spoken and printed : that printed words could be read aloud or silently ; that they " said " the same message . The value in the sharing of a whole , physical book  --  illustrated or not  --  was supposed to lie in the demonstration that an adult enjoyed the process of reading  --  therefore a child should be pleased to imitate this action . Primary grades in public schools employed picture books to show one way in which children could locate , on a page , words , generally nouns , and call their " names . " The use of flannel or felt boards extended the illustrated type of presentation , and sometimes an available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through speaking and drawing the story at the same time . The flannel board approach made tangible  --  and of course more visible  - -  the persons and things written about in the story being portrayed . This method of sharing a story brought with it an element of suspense , and encouraged the centering of the children 's attention on a fixed area . The flannel board also helped to involve the child in preparation of the materials used in telling the story . Most of the flannel board presentations , however , are now conducted by adults , the boys and girls being kept around as " audience . " This type of program precludes the inclusion of older children unless they are brought into the group to serve as program assistants or as companions to young charges . Other variety programs were brought to patrons in public libraries to acquaint children with the several forms of art : the drama , music , and puppetry . These special occasions did not take the place of the regular story hour . They were additions to any series previously scheduled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and audience for their particular presentations . Some of these entertainments were productions by women 's clubs , especially by organizations of young women who were active in community affairs , and in cultural interests and pursuits . Sometimes the special programs consisted of only one person : a volunteer who wished to share travels abroad and would bring an exhibit of souvenirs ; lecturers on subjects of
