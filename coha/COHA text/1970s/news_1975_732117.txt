txt The elusive Eliot Wiggington stood on the porch of his nearly-complete , six-sided log cabin and smiled widely when he heard how his visitor 's little car did " wheelies " up the mountainside before it stopped and refused to climb higher , still a steep , huffing-puffing half mile 3+110/1 of his house . Eliot smiled because he knows how tough he is to find . Everyone below , around the mountain-lake vacationland of Rahn County , Ga. , knows Wig , as they call him , and knows the wonderful things he 's done , but very few know where he lives . He has no phone , no known address , and no inclination to change either . He likes his privacy and has purposely perched himself here , away from the Florida tourist places and the tacky neon and the chicken drive-ins he despises , overlooking an entire log-cabin village he is helping carve out of the surrounding wilderness . THO HE 'D BE the last to admit it , the half-million dollar restoration project in his front yard is really a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANophy of the 32-yeer-old wunderkind . " The problem I 'm wrestling with now is how to keep the focus on the community and the kids and not fame and fortune , " says Eliot , who has indeed brought tame and fortune to this backwoods Appalachian mountain commuMty in Northeast Georgia . The miracle is called Foxfire  --  a remarkable enterprise that now Includes ? wealthy , nonprofit corporative , a revolutionary magazine , a series of best-selling books , and a dynamic , edtuntIonal philosophy that Wiggington began to work out in 1968 when be first started teaching 9th and 10th graders at the Rat= Gap-Nacoochee School . BACK THEN , his stedsets bored , restleu , destructive . Tommy Green tried to torch Eliot 's lectern . Charles Henslee idly whittled away at the floorboards with his hunting knife . Paper airplanes was soaring sad the whole class was down in the Out of desperation , Eliot , fresh out of Cornell with two degrees and boundless enthusiasm , decided he would try to win friends and influence bellav by abandoning the text and starting ' a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beastie that glows in the dark mountain coves . Eliot 's idea was for all the ptudents to go beyond the stifling classroom Walls , immerse themselves in documenting and preserving the fascinating mountain culture around them , and thus enliven and enrich their lives . " I DID N'T CARE about training journalists as much as I wanted to prove to these kids they could do much more than they ever thought possible . I wanted to sensitize them to the people , the culture , the minorities and stereotypes , and all the B.S. that encrusts their everyday lives , " says Eliot , who still teaches English at the Rabun Gap School . " I never believed kids could just ignore the hard skills and sit around , dig the sunset , and do macrame , " he says , " but I did want them to learn all the alternatives in terms of lifestyle , occupations , moral beliefs ... My hope was to turn out more sensitive , more aware , more self-confident human beings . " Which is precisely what he 's been doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easily one of the most successful high school projects ever begun and has inspired 300-500 imitators across the country . A rotating cast of the Foxfire kids have become heroes to an entire generation of teens . Armed with their notepads , cameras , and tape and videotape recorders and bubbling over with curiosity and creative juices , they have scoured the North Georgia countryside and unearthed some sensational stories . IN THE FIRST Foxfire book  --  which was published by Doubleday in 1972 and is fast approaching one million in sales  --  the kids told about the remarkable old mountain woman , Aunt Arie , and how she goes about making a taste sensation called souse by first removing the eyes from a fresh hog 's head t " I do n't care fer't bit more'n spit ' n the firel . And they lovingly recorded Pearl Martin on the all of soapmaking and got a crusty old mountaineer named Lon Reid to chat about how he makes chairs . That famous first Foxfire book had home remedies ( " Put butter round the sore so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure it . " I and weather signs PDT be a bad winter if squirrels ' tails grow bushier " I and spooky snake stories and all sorts of intriguing information about faith healing , dressing possum , planting by the zodiac , and how to build , use , and hide a first-rate , 50-gallon still . The second Foxfire book is doing just as well , the third is due out this summer with a larger press run than the other two , and Foxfire No. 4 is very much in the works . The magazine has a national circulation of 10,000 and has seeded countless other homespun , howto-do-it journals . " IF FOXFIRE tidal sell oar mere copy , we still have enough to keep this project going another 64 years , " Eliot says proudly . At its peak , the book brought in about $150,000 a year in royalties and now the checks flow in at a steady $125,000 annually Moot of the money is safely secured in Foxfire Fund , Inc. , certificates of dept. ' s-it . But the newest project , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies while the books and magatinee pretty much run themselves , is being paid for with interest and sonic principal . When the Foxfire center is complete next summer , it will include 25 log cat-ism , all original structures that have been located within 25 miles of the 107 ? acre mountain site , dismantled and rebuilt by the Foxfire kids and staff . The buildings will house all the looms , stills , tools , fiddles , banjos , and assorted artifacts Foxfire has accumulated over the years . There also will be facilities for videotaping , publishing , music recording , and an enormous archives center . AT ANY GIVEN moment , there will be dozens of ambitious projects under way . One Rabun Gap graduate named Mike Cook , who completed college and came hack to head the videotaping studio , will be helping the kids do daily programs for the community cable system . A high schooler will be working on a book about the changing roles of mountain women ; another will do a study of mountain preachers . Both of them will see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , where we can produce certain items like handmade furniture on a limited basis and sell to selected stores , " Eliot says . " Foxfire has never been involved with commercial distribution of goods before , and I know it smacks of selling out when I say ' commercial ' but I have to be realistic . The reason 90 per cent of these kids leave the area is not because Atlanta has nightclubs but because they ca n't get jobs up here . Land has gone from $300 to $3,000 an acre and they ca n't afford to stay . " I KNOW IT sounds ? bit pompous , but the real role for this project is to be a national testing ground for all sorts of ways to utilize the community to enrich the high school kids ' education . " Eliot will encourage visits by teens and educators who want to see the process up close , but he is determined not to open Foxfire Center to tourists . " Tourists could be a very big problem , " he says . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-lane , and have our kids spend their time giving tours to people who carve their names in logs and leave their fried chicken boxes on the ground . " Tourists obviously bug Eliot . He is aware of his responsibility to protect the naive , gentle mountain people and does n't hesitate to tell the story about the visitors who read about dear Aunt Arie in the first Foxfire book and pestered her so much , she finally sold them a priceless 150-year-old spinning wheel for $5 just to get rid of them . " That wo n't ever happen again , " he says .
