Up to 5,000 acres of land , largely open . <P> Cape Cod beaches within minutes . <P> Horse and hiking trails , bowling , swimming pools , gymnasium , 9-hole golf course , athletic fields ... <P> <P> It sounds like a land huckster 's pitch for a vacation-home development-but the property touted happens to be Otis Air Force base , and the idyllic description occurs in a slick brochure mailed by the state of Massachusetts to 1,500 corporations round the world . The state has been driven to this bit of hard-sell real estate promotion by the necessity of cushioning the impact of a federal economy drive on its citizens . <P> Since April 1973 the Pentagon has closed 13 U.S. military bases and curtailed the use of scores more in an effort to save the Treasury $3.5 billion over the next decade . Though the bases are scattered through 32 states , the economic blow has fallen hardest on New England ; nearly half of the 74,000 jobs wiped out or transferred by the cutbacks were located in Massachusetts and Rhode Island . The closings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complex and the exodus of a 30-destroyer fleet have lowered the personal income of Rhode Island 's citizens by $307 million a year-a loss about equal to the economic damage wreaked in Indiana , Ohio and Kentucky by this spring 's tornadoes . In addition , Rhode Island Governor Philip Noel complains that the state has been saddled with expenses , especially for schools , run up to please the Navy . <P> Now the states are trying to interest private companies in setting up shop on the unused bases . They face serious obstacles . Though most of the land is choice , some of the bases contain outdated utilities and old buildings that would be expensive for a company either to renovate or tear down . Also , the military goes on using portions of some of the bases for such purposes as storing nuclear materials . Hale Champion , former chairman of the Massachusetts Federal Base Conversion Commission , referring hyperbolically to radiation from the nuclear stockpiles , asks : " Who wants to build a shoe factory that will glow in the dark ? " <P> Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a jungle of red tape . The Federal Government retains ownership of the base land and buildings until somebody else takes them over , and it reserves the right to determine the " best use " of them-a decision in which as many as eight federal agencies may get involved . Under some circumstances , the Federal Government will turn over base property free for use as parklands or airports . But if a state , local community or private company wants to use part of a base for industrial purposes , it must buy the land and any improvements at a " fair market price , " which is determined after an appraisal by the General Services Administration . <P> Rhode Island nonetheless has persuaded the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics to lease from the Navy three seaplane hangars at Quonset Point for the construction of nuclear submarine hulls ; eventually 2,000 people will be employed there . In addition , New England Electric System is negotiating with state and federal agencies to buy the Charlestown Naval Air Station in Rhode Island and build a nuclear power plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
