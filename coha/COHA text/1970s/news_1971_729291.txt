Each played a principal role in events surrounding the fatal shooting by national guardsmen of four students last May . Each now seeks a spot on the Kent City Council : ?

Former Kent State student Ronald E Weissenberger , one of 25 students and faculty members indicted in connection with the rioting . ? Auto-parts salesman Lowell T. Davis , a member of the Portage County Grand Jury tnat indicted Mr. Weissenberger and the others last Oct. 16 . Though the memory of the disturbances is still fresh in the minds of many in this city of 27,000 , there has been no indication that " law and order " will be a campaign issue in the May 4 Democratic primary .

He said it would be determined at the time the defendants are brought to trial whether the controversial report prejudiced a fair trial . " The people are getting tired of this lawand-order stuff , " declares Mr. Thompson . " I 'm for law and order but I do n't think the people want to hear about it in a campaign . " Much attention is focused on Mr. Weissenberger , who will receive a degree in speech and broadcasting this month but hopes eventually to attain a master 's degree in special education .

He filed his petitions 10 minutes before the deadline and has six signatures ? one more than was needed . Mr. Weissenberger , who has never voted before , makes clear his running does not mean he has joined " the system . " Rather , he says , he will work within the system to change it . Several members of the Kent Defense Fund , which is raising money to defend those indicted , approve of his running , Mr. Weissenberger said , and he doubts if his running will upset campus groups dedicated to changing the system . " They know where I stand , " Mr. Weissenberger asserted . " We 've discussed it before .

Mr. Weissenberger is a native of Huron , in western Ohio . He has lived in Kent six years . His stepfather is a construction worker . Mr. Weissenberger is running in a ward that has some older homes but primarily is composed of apartment dwellers . Though Mr. Weissenberger has some students in his ward , Kent State student body president Craig Morgan ? who , like Mr. Weissenberger , was indicted by the grand jury ? is dubious over Mr. Weissenberger 's chances .
