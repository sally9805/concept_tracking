txt The slaying of four American tourists and four workers at a golf course here last Wednesday has clouded the economic future of the Virgin Islands and has raised fundamental questions about the future race relations on an island that had prided itself on its tropical serenity . Seven men have been charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery in the killings during a robbery at the Fountain Valley Golf Club . Two have been arrested and the issuance of warrants for the other five was announced today by Ronald Tonkin , the Vit. ? gin Islands Attorney General . The crime has caused introspection about the enormous changes here during the last 15 years when the population tripled in size and the islands of St. Croix and St. Thomas began to reel from some of the social ills that beset the mainland United States . " People here now must be forced to ask themselves why a crime like this happened in an area that is supposed to be an American paradise , " said Gerard Christian , 66 president of the Virgin Islands Business men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I strongly condemn this crime , " he continued , " and maybe the ones who committed it are mentally ill , but we must recognize that it is an outgrowth of a community that is sick . And it 's time to deal with the illness and not just the symptoms . " The local minority white population has called for better // police protection and more stringent measures against lawbreakers , he pointed out , I but they have not confronted the underlying problems that are responsible for an accelerating crime rate on the islands and the social disaffection of young black males . The local authorities said that from five to seven black men in their early ' 20 's stormed the Fountain Valley Golf Club , a public course owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller , last Wednesday afternoon and opened fire at everyone in the vicinity of the clubhouse . Since seven of the eight dead were whites , including two married couples from Miami who were on a golfing vacation , speculation on this tense island has dwelled on the motives of the gunmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only motive , and many have convinced themselves that the theft of money from the pockets of the victims was only secondary to the racial nature of the slayings . Two black men , Meral Smith , 21 years old , and Beaumont Gereau , 23 , were charged yesterday with the murders and the police continue di hunt for the other suspects . The five men for whom warrants ' were issued are Warren Ballantine ; Ishmael LaBeet ; Raphael Joseph ; a man named Sanchez , no first name given , and a man known as Pepe or Pablo , no last name given . The two men arrested , both of whom were unemployed , are being held in $1-million bond each . Governor Comments post-doctoral work on the Virgin Island government . " What the Crusan native of the Virgins sees is that the island is no longer his island , Rapid economic development has meant an influx of outsiders . Businesses are white owned and the Crusans complain that the Continentals those from the mainland are not sensitive to the nonIcompetitive and social culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks to participate in the economic success of the islands had been partly by default . No Crusan , for example , works in the hundreds of hotels and restaurants . Most of the men and women who fill these jobs are aliens imported from other islands in the West Indies , he explained . Shun Menial Work The Crusans shun menial work , leaving the hotel jobs to the aliens , who are called " garrots , " a deprecating reference to the birds of prey that migrate from island to island in the Caribbean . These aliens now constitute one-fourth of the island 's 80,000 population . In addition there is a very large segment of Virgin Islands residents who are first- or second-generation immigrants from Puerto Rico who can live here , because they- are also United States citizens , without visas or work permits . The Crusans have gravitated toward careers in managerial and professional positions , Mr. De Zela said , and have become dependent on the government as the major source of employment opportunities . They have created a huge bureaucracy that accounts for one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , he pointed out , I $98-million of the government 's ; $124-million budget is ear- ' marked for operating expenses , most of it in salaries , and little , is spent for public works and other needed capital outlays. ity . had lived among the black majority without prejudice , " We never locked doors an this island until 10 years ago , " said Mr. Christian , the black business man , " All of a sudden we have segregated suburbs and some fellows from New Jersey who react to us like he would to a black man back home . We are different and we want these Continentals to understand us . They should come here in the spirit of helping  --  not just take their money and run . " Another force of considerable impact was a revolution in communications . The Virgin Islands did not have a radio station until 1950 ; now there are several radio stations and three television channels . Nearly all of the television programing is from the mainland , and the race struggle of the United States is daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness and black militancy is familiar . Economic development brought crime along with traffic jams and rising costs . At the beginning of the last decade , , when there was no industry here and approximately 200,000 tourists spent $25-million annually , an average of 400 criminal cases were handled by the police , including three murders . By the end of the decade , with a-million tourists spending over $100-million , the police load jumped to about 3,000 cases and in 1971 there were 15 mure ders . Governor Evans said that the colonial administration of the island in the past had produced serious shortcomings in the penal system that had allowed criminals to escape imprisonment , either because of a lack of facilities or an unwillingness by judges to impose harsh sentences . He said this situation was being corrected as quickly as possible and some criminals were already being sent to Federal prisons on the mainland when overcrowding of the local facilities warranted it . Gov . Melvin Evans , a black physician who is the first elected governor of the island , has insisted that the murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumors , , but the information I have , clearly indicated it was not racial , " he said today in an interview . " I saw the photographs of the bodies at the scene and believe me they clearly show that no one was lined up and executed as the rumors would have it . " The Governor pointed out that one of - those killed at the golf course was a black man , and three of the wounded were also black . He said he could not understand on the basis of this evidence how anyone could therefore speculate that the gunmen were on a mission designed to kill whites . He did concede , however , that other crimes on the islands in recent years could have been the product of an antiwhite resentment that has been on the rise among native blacks as more and more mainland Americans settle here . " There is no question that , antiwhile sentiment exists and it is greater than it was four , or five years ago , " he remarked . " But why should that be surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ? " The resentment has been spawned by a combination of factors that , over the last decade , have transformed the United Slates Virgin Islands , an unincorporated possession , which had been purchased in 1917 from Denmark for $25-million . " The Virgin Islands has been the focal point of urbanization in the eastern Caribbean for the past 10 years , " said ' Pardo De Zela , a resident of St. Croix for the last 15 years who is doing When tax concessions opened the way for the development of private industry on St. Croix 's southern shore , most of the labor force to fill the new jobs was imported from the mainland because the Crusans were not prepared for technicians ' jobs . There are no current unemployment figures available , government officials have explained , , but it is understood that the rate is above 7 per cent , and the hardest-hit group is the young black Crusans . Industry also brought in some Continentals with racist attitudes who brought their prejudices with them .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
