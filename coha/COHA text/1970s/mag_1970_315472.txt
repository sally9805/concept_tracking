In eight precedent-shattering trips to foreign nations , Pope Paul VI has visited Africa , Latin America , the Middle East and even New York City-all without incident . Last week , in the course of another excursion out of Rome , the Pontiff experienced his first hostile encounter . It came from , of all people , Italians . During a nine-hour visit to the island of Sardinia , Paul and his motorcade became involved in a battle between police and Sardinian anarchists in which rocks and fists flew . Uninjured and safely back in Rome , the Pope next day leveled an unusually caustic criticism-somewhat reminiscent in tone of Vice President Agnew-at Italian newspapers for having headlined that single incident when his reception in Sardinia had been overwhelmingly favorable . <P> The papal visit to the poor and rocky island in the Tyrrhenian Sea began joyfully enough . Flying into the capital of Cagliari , Paul was welcomed by the blast of boat whistles and salvos of fresh carnations and mimosa blossoms tossed in his path . Never before had a reigning Pontiff been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exiled there in A.D. 235 by the Christian-hating Emperor Maximinus Thrax . <P> The reception put Paul in a good mood . Celebrating an open-air Mass in the principal piazza of Cagliari , Paul ended the service with a notable benediction . " Blessed be the Cagliari soccer team , " he said smilingly , thus saluting the Sardinians for their first championship in Italy 's major soccer league .

While he was accepting gifts of fish and lobster and speaking to a crowd of 4,000 slumdwellers , a group of 20 anarchists held a protest near by . They called Paul an Antichrist , and insisted that Sant ' Elia needed toilets and pharmacies more than papal visits . Police moved in to end the demonstration , and a fight broke out ; 26 people were injured and 21 arrested before it was stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Paul and Jean Cardinal Villot , the Vatican Secretary of State , were riding at the close of their visit . <P> The Vatican later said that no such thing had happened . " It was an argument between police and demonstrators , " a papal spokesman said . " Nobody opposed the Pope . " Back in the Vatican , Paul used a routine audience at St. Peter 's to blast the press . " They are no longer papers of information but deformation , " he said . " They turned our visit upside down . " Paul and his advisers were apparently worried that the confrontation at Sant ' Elia might set a precedent that would encourage demonstrators to seek free publicity during future papal visits .
