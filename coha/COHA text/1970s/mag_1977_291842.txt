ANNE SEXTON : A SELF-PORTRAIT IN LETTERS Edited by Linda Gray Sexton and Lois Ames Houghton Mifflin ; 433 pages ; $15 <P> A poem is a one-of-a-kind , heart-made object . To make one right takes a great deal of silence : also hearing nothing but one 's own voice . Poetry exacts its measure of pain , but that is not to be confused with anguish . Anguish is what has obsessed many of our best-known " confessional poets , " including Robert Lowell , John Berryman , Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton . They also expressed some joys , but in the end depression always tipped the balance . Lowell fought the dank beast throughout his life . Berryman , Plath and Sexton took their own lives when , as Rilke wrote in " The Song of the Suicide , " the world 's profusion entered the head rather than the bloodstream . <P> No other contemporary American poet has written more urgently and directly about this fatal shunt than Anne Sexton . Her poems were torn from her life as a daughter , housewife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she called " the excitable gift . " The phrase is from her poem " Live , " from a collection that embraced such titles as " Wanting to Die , " " Suicide Note " and " Sylvia 's Death . " Plath ( 1932-63 ) and Sexton ( 1928-74 ) were friends who spent hours discussing their art , illnesses and the ways they would kill themselves . Yet it is difficult to read Sexton 's correspondence and conclude that she truly wanted to die . Her tragedy was that she wanted to live on her own intense terms , not merely to survive as an emotional cripple on Thorazine crutches . " Life screams in the head of every artist with his typewriter or his pen , so let it , " she writes to a fellow poet undergoing psychiatric treatment . " Write it all down ... anything you write now will be gold later so mine it and do n't make the God-damned baskets . " <P> The bravura of such statements must be weighed against Sexton 's desperate reliance on family , friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want everyone to hold up large signs saying YOU 'RE A GOOD GIRL , " she confesses to Poet W.D . Snodgrass , the " Snodsy " of dozens of mash notes . Sexton could not settle for having ordinary pen pals . Her correspondents were her audience , confessors , advisers and advisees . Editors Linda Gray Sexton , the poet 's elder daughter , and Lois Ames , a close friend and estate-designated biographer , make it quite clear that to be on the poet 's mailing list could mean finding oneself embroiled in a passionate postal love affair . " Dearest dear De , " " Dear One , " " Dear Phil Baby , " " Dear Wonderful Nolan ! " " Dear wonderful lovely Tillie Olsen " are typical salutations . She lavished compliments , flattery and secrets , and expected to be repaid in kind . Like her poems , her letters were uninhibited pieces of herself offered " in deep fear of rejection .                  @ @ @
