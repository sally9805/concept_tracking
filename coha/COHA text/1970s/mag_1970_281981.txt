WITH unexpected rapidity , U.S. and South Vietnamese forces opened new fronts along the Cambodian border last week . Initially , the drive against the Communist sanctuaries involved 20,000 allied troops operating in two areas , the Parrot 's Beak and Fishhook havens northwest of Saigon . By week 's end , as half a dozen new task forces were hurled into the border war , the sweeps had spread south as far as the Mekong River and north to the highlands near the Laotian border . What started as a two-front foray was now a campaign engaging 40,000 troops along 600 miles of the frontier ( see map ) . <P> According to the promise made by President Nixon last week , the U.S. troops will penetrate no more than 21.7 miles into Cambodia and will be withdrawn no later than July 1 . But the South Vietnamese ground forces are under no such restrictions , and may well drive deeper and stay longer . In fact , a South Vietnamese naval force was on its way toward the very heart of Cambodia at week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 South Vietnamese gunboats headed up the Mekong , bound for Phnom-Penh . Ostensibly , its mission is to evacuate South Vietnamese from the Cambodian capital . Along the way , however , the heavily armed boats did not hesitate to engage Communist troops occupying the key Cambodian river town of Neak Luong ( see following story ) . <P> Of the new thrusts launched last week , the two most important were aimed at areas from which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong regulars have long ventured forth to terrorize key positions in South Viet Nam . The two : OPERATION BOLD LANCER , directed at Base Area 354 , between the Fishhook and the Parrot 's Beak . The area has long been home for one of the most destructive of all Communist units , the crack 95C Regiment of the North Vietnamese Army , which has made life miserable for the allies in War Zone C in Tay Ninh province . Base Area 354 has also served as headquarters for the NVA 's 9th Division , which has led every major attack on the Saigon area in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Communist divisions . Bold Lancer , which involved a brigade of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division , fell behind schedule almost immediately . When the troops arrived at the Cambodian town of Tasuos , an enemy rest and training area , they found half-eaten meals and abandoned NVA rucksacks and mess kits , but no NVA . OPERATION PACIFY WEST ONE , directed at Base Area 702 in the densely foliaged Central Highlands . It was from this sanctuary that the Communists masterminded a host of battles , including the recent assaults on camps at Bu Prang and Due Lap . Elements of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and Saigon 's 22nd Division are involved in the operation , which promises to be particularly arduous because wild terrain rules out anything but travel by foot . Like Bold Lancer , the exercise got off to a sputtering start ; vicious ground fire pinned down the first troops to arrive , and an inexplicable shortage of helicopter fuel temporarily kept 1,000 men waiting for the jump-off in Viet Nam . After two days , the troops had combed only 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
