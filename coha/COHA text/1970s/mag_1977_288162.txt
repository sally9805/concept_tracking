Newswatch <P> The frontier between truth and fiction used to be a well-lit border , and anyone caught trying to cross it was severely punished . No longer . So many others are now romping in what used to be the press 's own domain-contemporary history and the lives of current public figures-that it 's hard to tell the truth without a score card , and no one is providing one . <P> ABC 's 12-hour-long serial , Washington : Behind Closed Doors , is a fine example : it was called fiction ( which helps avoid libel suits ) , but since it was loosely " based " on a novel by John Ehrlichman , who went from the White House to the jailhouse , part of the fun was seeing how he got even with his Washington colleagues . At least Washington stuck fairly close to its characters ' recognizable attributes , unlike most of the schlocky bestselling novels of recent years that trade on the public 's understanding that they are really about Marilyn Monroe , Jacqueline Onassis or Howard Hughes The viciousness of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can be assigned cheaply torrid love lives with little chance of legal redress . <P> Television , however , in its new fondness for " docu-dramas , " is subject to special danger of another sort . People who go to a moviehouse expect to see fiction and accept the conventions of historical drama : no one is much worse off if everyone 's image of Disraeli is George Arliss or if Gregory Peck romanticizes the legend of Douglas MacArthur . But , as a number of psychologists have pointed out , the television screen provides most people with their visual knowledge of real events , such as President Kennedy 's assassination , so that truth and show-biz demands are bound to get mixed up when two networks ( ABC and CBS ) morbidly return to the scene of the crime this fall and mimic its actuality , with docudramas on Lee Harvey Oswald . Because people are more apt to spot a poor job of makeup than a perversion of the facts , historians worry about television 's lopsided history lessons .
