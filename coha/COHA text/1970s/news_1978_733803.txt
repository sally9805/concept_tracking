txt Though President and Congress have deserted Washington 's hot , muggy streets , a high-level governmefit task force is urgently exploring all possible anti-inflation measures , " short of wage and price controls . " Without some stiffening of President Carter 's anti-inflation program , analysts here believe the 1979 inflation rate will run roughly at this year 's anticipated level ? 8 percent . Next year , said a senior government official , " starts out with two built-in inflation additives " ? the minimum wage moves up from $2.65 to $2.90 an hour and the payroll , or social-security tax , also rises sharply . " Together , " the official said , " these may add 0.4 percent to the consumer price index , " as businessmen tack these higher labor costs onto prices . An upsurge in food prices , such as distorted the price picture in ' the first half of 1978 , would nudge the inflation rate even higher . The report of the inflation-fighting task force is due to the Economic Policy Group ' ( EPG ) ? Mr. Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals , " said a task force member , " probably will go to the President sometime in October . " Because consumer prices ? spurred by the soaring cost of food ? shot up at a more than 10 percent rate during the first six months of 1978 , inflation will have to moderate to 6 percent for the rest of the year to achieve an overall 8 percent pace for the year . Economists in and out of government canvassed by this reporter center on 8 percent as the likely rate , with few believing that next year 's inflation pace will drop much below that . Consumer prices rose 12.2 percent in 1974 , 7 percent in 1975 , only 4.8 percent the next year , then climbed 6.8 percent in 1977 . Inflation and the decline of the dollar are closely linked , with the fall in the dollar 's value over the past year adding at least 1 percent to the consumer price index , according to U.S. Treasury estimates . A weak dollar makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans to buy . This in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on competitive U.S. products . // From page 1 Task force tries to cope with ' 79 inflation The extent of such " piggybacking " is hard to measure , said a U.S. Treasury official , because all kinds of costs ? labor , raw materials , parts ? go into price hikes . Preliminary government studies , however , indicate that prices of some American steel products may have risen in response to a U.S. Government " trigger price " scheme designed to reduce imports of foreign steel . To prevent dumping of low-cost Japanese and European steel , the White House early this year set price floors on foreign steel , below which it can not be sold in the United States . Steel price rose American steel firms have benefited , adding jobs and output . But U.S. Treasury figures indicate that the prices of products shielded by the trigger-price scheme may have risen faster than other steel products not so protected . " Budget deficits in a relatively slack economy are not a major cause of inflation , " said a government economist , " but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have to be reduced , " even at the cost of no new social programs . " Wages chasing wages " is billed by a number of government officials as a primary cause of inflation , with no break yet forseen in the prevailing pattern of 8 percent yearly wage hikes in American industry .
