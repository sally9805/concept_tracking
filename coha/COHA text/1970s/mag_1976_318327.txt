DAYS IN THE TREES by MARGUERITE DURAS <P> The prevailing mood of this play is that of a fitful breeze stirring faded autumn leaves . Its central figure is an old woman ( Mildred Dunnock ) haunted by her impending death . She ruminates on many things and , like the play itself , comes to grips with none . Known only as " The Mother , " she talks of old age , of passions spent and love unrequited , of parenthood and the serpents ' teeth of thankless children . Since the play was originally written some 20 years ago by French Novelist , Dramatist and Film Writer Duras , it is very much in the theater-of-the-absurd tradition and echoes that genre 's abiding theme - whatever we do or do not do , nothingness conquers all . <P> Just a Gigolo . This old woman has come to Paris for a last visit with her favorite son ( Joseph Maher ) . As a boy , he used to idle away hours in the trees . As a man , he has idled away his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightclub . The woman he lives with is the club hustler ( Suzanne Lederer ) . The conversational pas de trois that these three engage in is replete with bitterness and non-sequitur absurdist humor . The performers are also forced to carry an elephantine load of symbolism . <P> They are up to it . Dunnock unfalteringly reveals the interwoven strands of love and hate in a mother 's heart , and Joseph Maher is splendid in conveying the sleazy , yet captivating charm of one of life 's eternal dropouts . <P> Days in the Trees seems like a bad dream from which the playwright could not awaken . Nor can the actors who shudder convulsively with the dire reality of it . <P> T. E. Kalem
