Nowhere did the Democratic triumph so approach land slide proportions as in the balloting for state legislatures . The Democrats won both houses in 36 states , an increase of eight over 1972 and their highest tally since 1936 . Going into the election , the Republicans controlled both houses in 16 states ; the total was four when the voting was done - Vermont , North Dakota , Kansas and Idaho . <P> What is more , the Democrats won the gubernatorial elections in 27 of the 36 states in which they gained control of both houses . Thus the party leadership in those states should , in theory at least , have little trouble putting through their legislative programs . In addition , the Democratic legislatures will surely be tempted to redistrict their states at the expense of the G.O.P. , setting patterns for future elections . And , since state legislatures are traditionally the training ground for young politicians , the Democrats will have a richly stocked farm system of future talent . <P> Some of the election results made even the Democrats blink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since 1893 . In Illinois they control both houses for the first time in 36 years , in Ohio for the first time in 15 years . At times it seemed as though any Democrat could beat any Republican . In Illinois an obscure civil servant named Robert T. Lane defeated Jack Walker , a former speaker of the house . W. Robert Blair , the present speaker of the Illinois house and a man who had been mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate in 1976 , went down to defeat in a traditionally Republican district . <P> In Connecticut , a 93-to-58 Republican advantage in the house suddenly became a mirror-image 93-to-58 Democratic majority . In Maine , once rock-ribbed Republican , the Democrats won domination of the house , 88 to 23 . In the Massachusetts senate , the Democrats rolled up better than a 4-to-1 margin . Democrat William Owens , a former inmate of the Walpole State Prison , became the first black to be elected to the Massachusetts Senate . <P> In California the Democratic candidates generally did far better than Governor-elect Jerry Brown . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Democrats also carried the senate , 25 to 14 , thus giving the new Governor a receptive legislature for his programs . <P> The Republicans were also battered throughout the South , but nowhere more severely than in North Carolina . Before Tuesday 's debacle , the G.O.P. held 15 of the 50 seats in the senate . Now they have one . A political observer in the state explained that the Democrats had urged the voters " to return North Carolina to the party of your fathers , " and that , thanks to Watergate and inflation , they did-at least for the next two years .
