THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON February 7th , the official Chinese news agency released a dispatch saying that Hua Kuofeng , the Acting Premier of the State Council , had greeted the first ambassador from Venezuela to the People 's Republic of China . Until that time , Mr. Hua had been known merely as the sixth-ranking Deputy Premier and the Minister of Public Security . With an offhand phrase in a routine report , the Chinese government revealed that he had been chosen as the temporary successor to the late Chou En-lai . According to the Times , even Chinese Communist sources in Hong Kong had to admit that they knew nothing about the man 's date or place of birth , his family background , his education , or whether he had a wife and children . His promotion was an eyebrow-raising surprise . Mr. Hua is not the only Chinese leader to have made a sudden jump between obscurity and prominence . Indeed , if one examines the careers of the present constellation in Peking , one finds that the pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable magnitudes : some whose existence is unknown to the ordinary observer , some twinkling faintly , some brilliantly visible . In assuming his job , the Acting Premier leapfrogged over several more likely candidates , including Chou 's own apparent choice , Teng Hsian-p'ing . Until 1966 , Mr. Teng had been Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party . Then , in the upheaval known as the Cultural Revolution , he was denounced as a bourgeois reactionary , purged , and cast into oblivion . In 1973 , he miraculously reemerged and began assembling an imposing collection of official titles  --  a collection that has now been left unfinished . Given his past experience , Mr. Teng has reason to he concerned about holding on to what he has . When the Cultural Revolution burst forth , the chief of state , second in prestige to Chairman Mao , was the veteran Communist Liu Shao-ch'i . He had shown damaging signs of elitism , having intimated that superior persons like him should live apart from the mass , and he became the Cultural Revolution 's principal target . Ejected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an undisclosed later date . His fall coincided with the rise of Lin Piao , the Minister of Defense . Lin rode the crest of the Cultural Revolution and won designation as Mao 's successor . In 1971 , he died mysteriously in a plane crash , and was subsequently accused of having plotted against the Chairman 's life . Today , his name is reviled throughout China . All these changes and others like them impelled us to take a fresh look at China 's press , which the people of the rest of the world ( and the Chinese people themselves ) must rely on for explanations of movements in the power structure . In recent years , a dominant theme has been a campaign of propaganda , still somewhat enigmatic , directed against Confucius and certain other cultural figures . Early in 1974 , American newspapers reported that an article had appeared in China attacking such Western composers as Mozart , Beethoven , and Schubert . At first , this seemed to be merely a bizarre manifestation of Communist ideology , but it turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piao were depicted as the main villains . At tacks were launched also against a film by Michelangelo Antonioni , an indigenous opera called " Three Trips to T'aofeng , " and an opera called " The Song of the Gardener . " Rumors were heard of disorders resembling those of the Cultural Revolution , but the regime guided the campaign toward study and discussion , and the anti-Confucian rhetoric eventually quieted down . Rhetoric along similar lines , however , has not abated . As the Times has noted , the classic novel " The Water Margin " has become the latest cultural target , abused for its portrayals of " capitulationism " and " revisionism . " And one need only take a cab to the International Affairs Building at Columbia University , where the Herbert Lehman Library keeps transcripts of the United States government 's Foreign Broadcast Information Service , to see , for example , that on January 22nd Kwangsi Province reported on the progress of a program against Confucius , Mencius , Lin Piao , and " bad local folksongs , proverbs , and books " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare-time literature and art propaganda teams , " five hundred and ten " physical-culture teams , " and fifteen hundred and forty " political and cultural evening schools . " Clearly , the energy expended on this kind of campaign through all of China has been enormous . When Confucius first came under attack , professional China-watchers speculated that the criticism had allegorical overtones . The commonest line of conjecture was that Confucius was really a stand-in for Chou En-lai and that his critics were certain ideologues who had acquired status in the Cultural Revolution and were rivals of Chou . This theory was dropped as Chou remained in office and endorsed the campaign himself , and the American press 's treatment of the mystery became rather fragmentary . We have now found an academic article , " China 's Anti-Confucian Campaign 1973-74 , " by Merle Goldman , in Last September 's China Quarterly , that reviews most of the episode in detail and seems to make as much sense of it as possible . Mrs. Goldman , associate professor of history at Boston University and a research associate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a respected book with the title " Literary Dissent in Communist China . " She argues that the campaign , which actually began in 1973 , may indeed have been initiated by Cultural Revolutionaries intent on maintaining their policies , but that it was quickly taken over by Choir . " The dominant tone of the campaign has been to use historical figures and incidents to promote centralization , institutionalization , ideological unity , and production  --  not to foment the struggle , decentralization , and ... fervor associated with the Cultural Revolution , " she says . The assaults on works like " Three Trips to T'aofeng , " she reasons , may have been crosscurrents generated by a group of radical ideologues associated with Mao 's wife , Chiang Ch'ing , who wanted to gain ground in the cultural sphere . Despite Professor Goldman 's emphasis on the unemotional tenor of the campaign , she describes a society caught up in bewildering swings of opinion . In 1972 , Lin Piao was denounced as an " ultra-leftist ; " in 1973 , he became an " ultra-rightist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where it does not belong , and temporary political arrangements count for little . To one who has been heartened by the Chinese Communists ' success in eliminating want and venality , the picture of political irrationality is deflating . The unended open season on Confucius provides an arena for veiled controversy over the successions of Chou and Mao ; and , in fact , sp utte rin gs against power holders who " continue to take the capitalist road " ( the great crime in the Cultural Revolution ) have lately been heard . ( The strange pseudo-Presidential visit by Mao 's friend Richard Nixon seems to he a case of wishful thinking by both host and guest . ) Yet Professor Goldman , at least , sees some grounds for optimism . She points out that the recent anti-Confucianism has brought back a number of old writings that the regime had cast aside . The Taoist philosopher Chuang-tzu , for instance , has been cited for his criticism of the Confucian tradition , but many Chinese are bound to notice that Chuang-tzu was a spokesman for freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Goldman writes that the revival of the past and the return to scholarship may produce a livelier and more varied period than the People 's Republic has yet experienced . At any rate , in considering the contradictions of recent events some thoughtful citizens of that republic are likely to draw conclusions other than those that have been officially prescribed . ? ? Behind the Swinging Doors OUR friend the fellow-citizen and another man were seated together at Bun ' n ' Burger of Thirty-fourth Street at Sixth Avenue and Twelfth Street one lunchtime last week , staring at a couple of burgers in front of them , when we stopped in for a cup of coffee . " You would n't think it , " the fellow-citizen said as his friend took a bite of burger , " but the two of us were cooking haute cuisine last night , starting at 7 P.M. and continuing mita 7 A.M. , with no talking during that entire time . Somehow , we got signed up for a French-cooking course conducted by this amazing guy Daniel Strongin he 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz-Carlton in Boston . " " He 's one of the night chefs , " said the friend . " There were twenty-one of us , " the f. - c. continued , " and we each ponied up five bucks , not to mention two hundred dollars among us for food and vino and a small bottle of Grand Marnier for Daniel , so that this character  --  he allowed himr elf to talk  --  could hark orders at us all night , which he patiently explain ed is what French chefs have to do . Do n't get me wrong . It was one of the most interesting nights I can recollect , because now I know how things operate behind the swinging doors , which , you can believe me , is a world unto itself . " " He even taught us how to eat , " said the friend . " But that came later , " said the fellow-citizen . " That came at 6 A.M. , when we started eating everything we 'd cooked all night  --  lobster sushi , consomm ? St. Goodrick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn-fed Kentucky lamb with mustard sauce and vegetables , watercress salad , and ice cream la Greenstreet , which was invented by Sydney Greenstreet with rose wine , white wine , red wine , champagne , and coffee . " " And macaroons , " said the friend . " You 've got to be kidding , " we said . " You two ca n't even boil water . " The fellow-citizen gave an elaborate Gallic shrug . " I will have you know , " he said , " that I am now at least partly a saucier  --  a saucemaker  --  who is the extreme artist of haute cuisine and whose art is based on a combination of the vigilance of a cat standing over a hot mousehole and the discernment of Mr. Tetley 's tea tasters . Daniel taught me the shrug . He says the sauciers sit around the kitchen and tell bad jokes and sneer at the other cooks for not having the refinement to laugh at them . " At the beginning of the class  --  it was at the house of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humor salesman  --  we were all asked to sit down , and talk for once , to say what we did for a living and who had done the cooking when we were kids , Mom or Dad . Then Daniel  --  some fellow-cooks call him Charles , because he looks Iike Chaplin  --  outlined the theory of the French kitchen , which is divided up like the Army , it seems , according to the battle plan of General Escoffier . The pantry , in Daniel 's reading of the Escother design , is at the bottom  --  they 're like buck privates . They wash and chop veggies and hand them out at the right time to the tight people . From there you go up through all sorts of stewards , garde-mangers , meat roasters , pastry chefs , butchers , and so on and so forth , to the top of the heap  --  the sauciers , right under the chef and the sous-chef themselves , who are like God and the prophet . These days , the chef is usually an executive , a menu pusher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days if you gave the chef lip you 'd be lucky if there was anything left to get on the unemployment line . Then Daniel 's sous-chef  --  Christopher Daniels was his name  --  read from the writings of Brillat-Savarin , the greatest gourmet who ever lived : ' The Creator , while forcing men to eat in order to live , tempts him to do so with appetite and then rewards him with pleasure . Good living is an act of intelligence , by which we choose things which have an agreeable taste rather than those which do not . First parents of the human race , whose feastings are historical , what did you not lose for a ruddy apple , and what would you not have given for a. truthed turkey hen ? But in your Earthly Paradise you had no cooks , no fine confectioners ! I weep for you ! ' Then we had to put all the food on the table while Daniel showed us how to shop for fresh vegetables . Scratch the bottom of celery and lettuce " Pm down here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it 's moist , it 's probably fresh . With broccoli , what you 're looking for is a nice head and no branches pushing up through from lower down on the stalk . Then we were assigned to various stations and put to work and told not to smoke over the fond . That was the last I saw of my friend David here for some hours . " " You were n't a saucier , too ? " we asked the fellow-citizen 's friend . " No , " said David . " No , I was the maitre d ' , in charge of service , which did not occur for the first eleven hours of the evening , so I worked with the stewards and watched everybody else . Watching for eleven hours is harder than working for eleven hours . " " What did you see ? " we said . " Oh , the heights and the depths , " David said . " Like , for instance , this guy Burt , who had entered the premises with a sinister gleam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him on knife-sharpening detail . He was a natural . Later , Daniel set him to chopping some vegetables that had to be perfect . He was L transformed . He was the best vegetable chopper anybody ever saw . Precise . The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish . ' Everybody woke up enough to applaud . Pretty soon after that , we had our last break before service , and Christopher , the sous-chef , read an essay by Lin Yutang called ' On Having a Stomach ' : ' Why do the Westerners talk so softly and look so miserable and decent and respectable at their meals ? I feel sure that the child gets his first initiation into the sorrows of this life when his mother forbids him to smack his lips . ' During all this time , the only thing we had to eat was a few potato chips at one of the breaks , and , believe me , we were certainly in the mood for food . Before we went back to work , Daniel told us about how to eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put the food in your mouth , you chew it slowly , and after you swallow you wait , because the peak flavor experience , with all the overtones , and so forth , happens anywhere from thirty seconds to a full minute after you swallow the bite . My friend here , meanwhile , was having very different experiences . " THE fellow-citizen ordered us all fresh cups of coffee and took up the tale . " The saucier works as hard as a carpenter , and most of the time he acts as a biologist . I never would have believed this , but the basic ingredient of the French sauce , which is the culmination of exquisite cuisine , is garbage soup . The French are peasants , you know . They take some veal bones and some vegetables and boil ' em for hours . And all the time the stuff is boiling you watch it with an eagle eye and stand by with a ladle poised . There are albumins in the veal some sort of protein  --  and they come floating up and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a pure essence of subtle taste , and not a bowl of hot hair tonic . So you push the ladle down until its edges are just below the surface of your veal boil  --  the stuff is called stock , by the way  --  and the surface tension slides the albumins into the ladle . These albumins continue to rise every minute for about six hours , so you 're kept busy . You soon discover that as a pastime this kind of stocktaking is mono rit  --  titivo , but that as an exercise in keeping your attention on yourself , while at the same time according the stock the same kind of regard , it enables you to stay quite sharp . For one thing , the simmering stock  --  well , it 's not simmering , it 's what the French call ' smiling , ' which is a little more rolling than a simmer is always in motion , just like a living creature . For another thing , using surface tension to ladle out albumins without ladling out stock ' requires continuous subtle maneuvering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is something you and other people arc going to have to eat . For a fourth thing , you know that at any moment Daniel is going to yell ' Get your elbow out of the sauce ! ' With thoughts like these , you find that you stay on your toes indefinitely , and even have dine to sneak an occasional slug of cooking Chablis  --  one of the prerogatives of the saucier , Daniel explained , whenever the chef is n't looking . " Consomme is even more amazing than you might think . After your stock has got almost purified , you make it a whole lot worse . You throw in egg whites , eggshells , and raw hamburger . What these do is form a raft on top , and the albumins in the raft attract the remaining albumins in the clarified stock , and after another hour and a quarter of smiling you 're left with a pale , almost golden liquid under the raft , and this is consomme , which has the delicacy of rainwater but the fragrance of that huge stewpot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was dinner ? " we asked . " A Brahms quintet for the palate , " said the fellow-citizen . " Full of echoes and little twists and turns and unexpected vistas . The lobster sauce on the fish , for instance , brought back just a little reminder of the lobster sushi , while the tablespoonful of soy sauce in the mustard plaster baked onto the lamb connected to the soy sauce the lobster sushi was dipped in . Little things . For the first time in my life , I did n't want to eat much , and I was completely full . " " When I saw all the food spread out on the table at the beginning , I could never have imagined it would turn into the food I ate at the end , " said the fellow-citizen 's friend . " Daniel left about nine o'clock to catch the ten-o'clock shuttle back to Boston , " said the fellow-citizen . " When I thanked him for the night , he said , ' All it takes is nerve . You can do anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do it . ' " Birthday Party EUBIE BLAKE , the black pianist and composer , who began playing and writing ragtime music in the late nineteenth century , is about the only artist we know of whose work has enjoyed several revivals in his own lifetime . The latest renewal of interest in his music started around 1950 , and has picked up a special momentum in the last seven or eight years , and Mr. Blake is clearly enjoying every bit of it . In one of Casey Stengel 's declining years , he remarked that most people his age had been dead for a long time . It is the sort of remark we can imagine Eubie Blake making about himself , for his tongue just misses being as irrepressible and adventuresome as Casey 's was . At all events , Mr. Blake remains decidedly alive  --  a fact that was underscored a couple of Saturday evenings ago , when hundreds of his admirers , including us , filled the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf-Astoria to help him observe his ninety-third birthday . Mr. Blake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano and organ by 1889 , at around which time his playing began to reflect the influences of what certain people of that period called " lowlife " music . One day , his mother , a deeply religious woman , came into the house to hear Eubie swinging his music lessons in ragtime , and invited him to take that sort of playing elsewhere . He did just that a few years later , in 1898 , making his first public appearance in one of the notorious sporting houses of Baltimore , where he had been asked to supply the musical side of the entertainment . He wrote his first composition , " Charleston Rag , " in 1899 , the same year that Scott Joplin  --  ragtime 's genius published his much more fa-mous " Maple Leaf Rag . " It was not until 1921 ? after Mr. Blake had spent a number of years developing his skills on the vaudeville circuit and in various East Coast night clubs  --  that he hit the big time , in New York . That year  --  along with his collaborator the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of eighty-six -- he brought the highly successful musical " Shuffle Along " to Broadway . Songs from that show  --  as well as other songs that Mr. Blake wrote , with Noble Sissle or with Andy Razaf  --  have since become securely lodged in the popular repertory . Mr. Blake himself went on to become one of the legendary names of America 's popular music . His birthday party at the Waldorf came as close to being a democratic affair as the circumstances allowed . The crowd was made up of blacks and whites and foreigners , one couple having travelled all the way from Denmark to he there . Dress , optional , ranged from formal evening wear to casual denim . Ages ran from the late teens right on up to Mr. Blake 's own venerable ninety-three . The black bourgeoisie and the white bourgeoisie , both of them well dressed and glittering , were out in force  --  reminding us of how in the eighteen-nineties , when ragtime was coming in , their parents and grandparents had shunned Mr. Blake 's kind of music . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced ragtime openly  --  were out in any force , or , for that matter , that they were there at all . Their presence was part of what the circumstances did not allow , since it cost twenty-five dollars to get in . Not that this was any fault of Mr. Blake 's . He strikes one as being such a soft touch that he probably could n't find the heart to charge twenty-five dollars for anything . The party had been thrown for him by a group called the Amas Repertory Theatre , and it was they who set the price of admission . Not that they could be blamed , either , for they needed enough proceeds from the affair to establish a children's-theatre scholarship fund to be named after Mr. Blake . Eubie Blake was an exemplary guest of honor . He seemed to have time for everybody who came up to him , he signed every bit of paper that was shoved at him , and he was willing to go on talking as long as anyone wanted , or as long as anyone was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point during the evening , " I do n't like dead air . " Before the formal tributes began , we walked over and joined a group that had gathered around Mr. Blake 's table  --  which he shared with his wife , the former dancer Marion Tyler , to whom he has been married for the past thirty years , and with some close friends  --  to hear what was being said . We got there as Mr. Blake was answering a question about Scott Joplin , and caught this part of his reply : " Poor Scott , he never got the credit he deserved in his lifetime . I got more credit than he did . But most of what I got belongs to Scott , for I 'm not the musical man he was . It 's just that I 've been around a little longer . " A man in black tie asked where the word " ragtime " came from . " To tell you the truth , " Mr. Blake said , his face crinkling up in a roguish smile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As we listened to these exchanges , we had a chance to study Mr. Blake more closely . He was trim and dapper , wearing a dark-blue double-breasted suit , with wide lapels , deep side vents , and tapered waist ; a white handkerchief was sticking out of his breast pocket . lie sat very straight , as if he did n't want to rumple his attire . Everything about his appearance , however , was dominated by his pate , which does not have a hair left on it . But for a salt-and-pepper mustache and eyebrows , his entire head looks as clean as a light bulb . If there is anything about him that attracts more notice than his dress and his head , it is his
