THE CHOIRBOYS Directed by Robert Aldrich Screenplay by Christopher Knopf <P> Choir practice , according to Policeman turned Novelist Joseph Wambaugh , is a harness-bull euphemism for what cops do together off duty to relieve the tensions of their enervating jobs . It appears to consist mainly of boozing , wenching and venting gripes against their superiors and the semimilitary system in which they toil . It follows that the participants in these raunchy revels are The Choirboys . The movie of the same title just got in under the New Year 's Day wire as 1977 's most repulsive release , but Hollywood will have to go some to top it in ' 78 . <P> Wambaugh has dissociated himself from Robert Aldrich 's film , but its spirit is really not that far from his novel 's . <P> The intention in both cases is to demonstrate that cops are human too - vulgar , shady , resentful of authority , un feeling at precisely those moments when they need to show some sensitivity . But , of course , there is more to being human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book had about them the air of artless anecdote . They were tales that might have been funny if you 'd been there , but that turned flat and ugly in the retelling . <P> The movie is even farther removed from its realistic sources . It amounts to a lot of stupid dirty jokes among a group of men who demonstrate not a single redeeming , or even contrasting characteristic . An exception might be Charles Durning playing a weary , overweight cop fighting to keep a rebellious tongue in check until he can collect his pension . <P> The rest are sadists , masochists , sneaks , morons , arrested adolescents , vile companions for a two-hour journey . Aldrich has shot them all in a harsh , flat light that matches his essentially pornographic spirit , and he has directed without nu ance , jerking the movie to fitful life with occasional shocks - a beating here , a mur der there , over in the corner some sick , sad sex . <P> Howard Hawks , the director who made a distinguished subgenre about the affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , died a few days after this film 's release . <P> One trusts that he did not see how , in the ' 70s , his great and characteristically American movie theme has been debased in this film .
