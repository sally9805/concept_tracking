ON JULY 30 , 1975 , the heads of state of thirty-five nations gathered in Finlandia House , Helsinki , to ratify the Final Act of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation . Under the Ford Administration , this act was the foundation of detente , but the Carter Administration used the human-rights provisions of the same agreement to frame American foreign policy in a new style . On January 26 , 1977 , the Carter Administration publicly charged the Czechoslovak government with violating the Helsinki accords by harassing 300 Czech dissidents who had signed a human-rights manifesto called Charter 77 . The manifesto cited the Helsinki agreement as one basis for its complaints . Human rights became a key world issue , and once again Czechoslovakia was a test case in international affairs . The trouble in Prague last winter was perhaps not so dramatic as the ? events of 1938 , when England bought a brief peace from Nazi Germany by sacrificing Czechoslovak independence , nor as clearly defined as the trouble of 1968 , when the Soviets invaded Czech-oslovakia to put an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble in Prague reverberates throughout Europe because of Czech-oslovakia 's special status as an East European country whose culture and traditions are West European . Thus , while Russian tanks rolled through the streets of Prague in 1968 , Czech films were playing in movie houses in Paris , London , and New York , and , even more significantly , Czechoslovakia , among East European countries , still had the strongest modern democratic tradition . When normal channels of political expression are blocked in any country , its writers , in most cases , take up the role of social critic . In Czechoslovakia this has so long been the case that Czech writers traditionally see themselves this way . They , as much as any faction , were responsible for the brief liberal period after the Dubeek government replaced the atavistic regime of Antonin Novotny. 1 went to Czechoslovakia to find out how conditions have changed for its writers in the nine years which have passed since the last Soviet tanks left the streets of Prague for more discreet locations , out of sight in the countryside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government Press Office in Prague provided me with a translator and arranged one interview after another with government officials and authors ready to dismiss dissent as sour grapes and to vouch for the regime 's fairness in managing cultural affairs . Even on my last day in Prague , the Press Office telephoned my hotel at 7:00 A.M. , summoning me to one last-minute interview . Meanwhile , intellectuals from Prague 's dissident literary circles were besieging me in their excitement over an opportunity to have their views heard in the West . In one instance , three of them risked a stiff prison term for what they did for me , all the while insisting it was 1 who was doing them a favor by taking an interest in their struggle . I had a rare chance to glimpse the cultural life of Prague from both sides of the looking glass . My conversations on both sides gave a picture much more subtle than the simple one of Heroic Dissident v. Party Apparatchik most often seen from the distant and comfortable vantage points of open societies . There are subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the secret police are a constant , major influence upon every individual who must choose a tolerable role . At the ends of the spectrum are , on the Left , Ludvik Vaculik , the enfant terrible , and , on the Right , an old party soldier named Donitt Sajner , the present First Secretary of the Writers ' Union . In between are two former leading dissident writers : JiIi Sotola , a gifted poet/novelist who , in the mid-1960s , was First Secretary of the then rebellious Writers ' Union , and has recently changed from contentious outcast to rehabilitated dissident ; and DuS'an Hatriiik , a journalist/historian , who , after nearly a decade of anath , ematization , tries now , desperately , to redefine his place . 0 F THE TWENTY-ODD dissidents I knew by reputation before arriving in Prague , I most wanted to meet Ludvik Vaculik . Vaculik had been an important figure in the Dulkek era ? in fact , a key figure . He and his colleagues had , for years , experienced the intolerable situation of sharing a silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to them in public . At the Writers ' Congress in the summer of 1967 , Vaculik gave a blunt and vehement speech that released a torrent of antigovernment criticism . Although the proceedings of the congress were , of course , not published at the time , every detail of what he said was quickly known all over Prague . In the spring of 1968 public criticism emerged in Prague ; Vaculik had been the first to take his courage in hand . In the years after 1968 , Vaculik and others began a quasilegal publishing organization , called Padlock Press , to publish the works of Czech authors who were regarded as untouchable by the legitimate publishing houses . Produced entirely by typewriter , its samizdat editions range from a dozen copies to 300 . Circulation is strictly by hand . Over eighty books have been published by Padlock Press , of which Vaculik is de facto editor in chief- In order to reach Vaculik I went to see a mutual friend , an author who , I had reason to believe , was not under police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaculik , and he agreed without hesitation . He told Vaculik that I would eat breakfast every morning in the kavarna of the Hotel Europa , a seedy place with shades of Old World elegance where waiters in threadbare tuxedos serve a mixed clientele of East German tourists , Arab students , and gypsy whores . The days wore on , and Vaculik did not appear ; I sent more urgent requests . One thing I knew : his reticence to meet me was not from fear of police reprisals . From the sketchy stories I heard about his recent difficulties , I suspected he was stalling out of embarrassment . Eventually he sent word to meet me in the apartment of another mutual friend . Vaculik is often called a Moravian peasant to distinguish him from Prague sophisticates . True , he looks the part , with his bushy hair , thick , soup-strainer mustache , chunky hands , and stocky build . He is a man of blunt gestures , and he seeks refuge from pretentiousness in self-ridicule . But his shrewd eyes and agile protagonism do n't fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of wisecracks and his favorite American slang ( " Do n't give me any razzle-dazzle " ) , clearly in no mood to get down to business , and quick to demonstrate his friendly attitude . When I prodded him to tell me about his difficulties with the secret police , he swung around on his swivel chair , shouting into the void that his troubles were a bore . Then , without losing his good humor , he told the story . On April 26. 1975 , agents of the State Security Police searched Vaculik 's apartment , and , empowered by a warrant to confiscate " written materials as evidence of subversion of the Republic , " they took an unspecified number of photographic negatives . The photographs showed Vaculik and his mistress lying nude upon adjacent graves in a cemetery and in bed in erotic poses . The graveyard photos were ironic sight gags , and the bedroom photos were romantic " mementos . " On September 14 , 1976 , Vaculik was summoned to Bartolomejska Security Police Headquarters and offered the following blackmail proposition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press and stop criticizing the regime . Otherwise , he could expect not only that the photographs would be published , but also that he would be prosecuted on criminal charges of desecrating a graveyard . He told them to publish and be damned . Last January 21 , a weekend family magazine , Ahoj ( roughly , " cheers " ) , published two of the graveyard photos with a commentary ridiculing Vaculik as a compulsive exhibitionist . At roughly the same time , packets of the bedroom photographs began appearing in mailboxes in Prague and abroad . Among those who received them were foreign diplomats , foreign journalists , and dissident friends of Vaculik . For Vaculik the worst time was the first months after the negatives were stolen by the secret police , when he made his peace with his family and friends so that there was no surprise in it for them . Vaculik wrote an essay on the whole affair , called " Pass the Word to the Doctor . " The situation in Czechoslovakia , he wrote , reminded him of the horse opera in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperadoes , the citizens having no recourse in the law because the sheriff is crooked , too . The crooks control the town newspaper and the judge as well . What the citizens need is a lawyer beyond the reach of the crooks , yet one who belongs to the Wyoming bar . In the case of Czechoslovakia there is such a lawyer , a man with a Czechoslovak law degree who is , nonetheless , beyond the reach of the crooked gang . He is Kurt Waldheim , Secretary General of the Lnited Nations . The difficulty is to get his attention . " So I would ask any of you who are still fully clothed to go to him and tell him the whole story , " writes Vaculik in his closing lines . Vaculik 's troubles leave us to puzzle why a man in so delicate a position would court scandal in so seemingly blatant a fashion . His friends express the opinion that it was his means of escape from the burden of playing moral hero for a beleaguered culture . A S FIRST SECRETARY of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official of Czechoslovakia 's most powerful literary institution . He administers a fund that would make most Western authors blanch . Independent from Czech publishing houses , the union grants handsome advances to authors , sponsors trips abroad on comfortable expense allowances , sends authors on extended retreats at literary colonies , and has its own publishing house to boot . ? Before 1968 the union was one of the most independent bodies in the country , reflecting a tradition of political activism among Czech writers which extended back to the nineteenth century , when the Czech national revival was led by poets and novelists writing in their native language . After the Soviet invasion , the union was dissolved and re-formed with new , politically acceptable leaders . I N 1972 THE JOH OF First Secretary went to ajner , a literary nonentity who had worked in the Ministry of the Interior in the last years of the Stalinist era . This last fact would lead most Czechs to assume that Sajner 's first responsibility is still to the secret police , though all would acknowledge that in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a heavyset man in his early sixties with beefy hands . His gray hair is slicked back , and his manner is grand and gracious . " We welcome all journalists who come with good intentions , " he began our interview , " because we are glad to have the chance to show people that we are not such scarecrows as we are portrayed . " He continued with rhapsodies to the glories of socialism . On the uses of literature as a vehicle for social criticism , he said , " We welcome criticism , but who would criticize a social system that guarantees that no farmer ? will have to sell his farm to pay for a gall-bladder operation ? " When I reminded him that 600 of his fellow citizens , including prominent professionals and intellectuals , had thought their social progress so incomplete they had signed Charter 77 at the personal cost of police interrogations and , in many cases , the loss of their jobs , he stiffened visibly and defiantly . " The price we paid for our social system in blood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to allow attacks . " his career at home has been thriving , and the regime calls on him to talk to foreign correspondents on the subject of human rights . For our official interview at the press office , we were invited to use the office of the director , who sat throughout at his desk in the corner , reading his paper . I had expected to meet a sick and broken man , but Sotola , in his mid-fifties , is robust , overweight , and very lively . He is witty , urbane , and abundantly charming . His hands were in constant motion stirring his coffee , lighting one cigarette the moment the last was smoked down to a butt too hot to hold . 1 had to admire the way he managed to keep his dignity in a difficult situation . " One becomes a ' domestic emigre , ' " he said , describing his situation in the early 1970s with a term common in policy statements of party organs . " I was as much an outsider as if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both as a man and an artist . Then there was a change in the political climate . President Husak made a public statement that to ' those in the cultural sphere who are seeking their own position in the national collective a helpful hand will be extended . ' I took him at his word . 1 wrote an essay expressing my desire to rejoin the cultural life of our country and then had discussions with leading members of the Writers ' Union . Now all doors are opened to me . My essay was published in March 1975 , my novel appeared in 1976 , I have a play in performance now in a Prague theater , a second novel is at the printer , and a film based on one of my books is being shot . " I asked about his colleagues from the 1960s who have not made peace with the regime and remain without opportunities to have their works read except in sarnizdat . " I can only say about people in this situation that they put themselves there ; it is a situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put the responsibility for their situation entirely on the outcasts ? " I asked Sotola . He chuckled when he heard the translation . " It is not so simple ; no one person is responsible for history , and none of them chooses to live in the twentieth century . " He denied emphatically that his self-criticism of 1975 was written under the duress of the secret police . D ETAILS OF Sotola 's case are disputed among his dissident friends with whom he has broken relations . One told me that , as a former prominent outcast , Sotola was such a big fish that a simple self-criticism was enough to regain him access to outlets for his work , but another insisted that he knew for certain that Sotola had been obliged to give much more . Everyone I spoke with assured me that the negotiations are long and difficult and involve three parties : the author , the Writers Union , and the State Security Police . The police are the final judges . 1 N 1967 , DET'S'AN HAMMK was one of Czechoslovakia 's better-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekly journal of the Writers ' Union . Its circulation of 800,000 corresponds proportion . ally to that of Lite magazine in its heyday , but in other respects there is no American parallel because Noviny was high art and political dialectics combined , and everybody read it . As editor , Hanigik led the constant struggle with the Censor 's Office . In late 1967 , the government suspended publication entirely , and the journal remained shut down until Dub6ek took office ; then it resurfaced , more outspoken than ever , under a new name , Literarni Listy . Haingik 's book Writ . ers Against Rulers , describing the events leading up to the 1968 liberalization , impressed me greatly , so when I heard that he had recently signed the resolution of the Union of Artists expressing solidarity with the regime , I went to his Prague address to ask for an interview . Across the threshold I put my request to him . Hanigik stared at me long time before he turned to the side and , speaking to profile in a low voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not possible . In my position , it is not possible . I am very sorry . " In the following days , I questioned my sources for more information . During my interview with Sajner , I asked him about Harrsik 's status . " Hangik has shown an interest in rejoining the cultural life of our country , " said the First Secretary of the Writers ' Union . " Discussions are under way . " On the eve of my departure from Prague , I was invited by Pavel Kohout to join him and others for a nightcap at a restaurant in the fashionable Mala Strana district of the city . In his youth , Kohout was a romantic apostle of Stalinist socialism ; later , as he matured artistically , Kohout spent a decade winning the respect of Czech intellectuals and living down his poetry about the glories of life on a tractor at the collective . In the Duldelek era , he was one of the most outspoken writers calling for political reform , and since then he has been a " domes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time he has had 250 opening nights in West Europe and none in Czechoslovakia . One of his plays had a run on Broadway . Kohout is pure show biz , a man of gesture , the only glamour boy among the earthy Czech literati . The restaurant where we met had heavy draperies drawn back over brocade-paneled walls . Obsequious waiters kept our glasses filled with Russian champagne , and a four-piece orchestra played slightly funky Ames Brothers . Kohout wore a velvet tuxedo . In a moment of candor that seemed out of place in the , setting , Kohout told me what he knew about Harrgik 's delicate situation . " Around 1970 many of us who were politically active in 1968 gave up hope of finding Czech publishers arid began looking for foreign outlets . Ivan Klima and I made long-term contracts with a Swiss publisher . Sotola , Vaculik , and Milan Kundera all found foreign publishers . Harrislk tried , too , but for reasons unrelated to his talent , he proved to be unexportable . Now he has finished a long , ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding a foreign publisher , and so the only possibility of seeing it in print is to make peace with the regime . " I told Kohout and the others what Sajner had said about " discussions being under way " and looked around the table for a reaction . " That means they have n't finished squeezing the poor man 's balls , " someone said .
