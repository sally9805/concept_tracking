LIFE AT THE DAKOTA : NEW YORK 'S MOST PECULIAR ADDRESS by Stephen Birmingham Random House ; 241 pages ; $12.50 <P> No one who saw Rosemary 's Baby is likely to forget the fortress that housed the satanic gathering . In real life , however , the forbidding turrets and gables guard one of the oldest , ritziest and most famous apartment buildings in Manhattan . It is the Dakota , behind whose 2-ft. - thick brick walls live such celebrities as Lauren Bacall , Roberta Flack , and John Lennon and Yoko Ono , who own some 28 rooms throughout the Dakota and who once held a sance to commune with departed tenants . Other famous occupants have included Leonard Bernstein , Judy Holliday and Boris Karloff , plus several purported house ghosts . The Dakota is just the haunt , then , for Stephen Birmingham , who has made a living off the rich ( " Our Crowd , " The Right People . The Grandees ) and famous ( Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis ) . <P> A $1 million apartment house was considered a folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Central Park at 72nd Street . Rich New Yorkers had never favored apartment living . The site was also so far north and west of fashionable society that it was nicknamed the Dakota after the remote Western territory . Yet Clark went ahead with his ersatz castle , variously described as German Renaissance and Victorian chateau . The architecture and appointments , as Birmingham puts it , were meant to " convey the impression that , though one might be living in an apartment house , one was really living in a mansion . " <P> The illusion succeeded . Between 1884 and 1929 , there was not one vacancy in the monumentally ostentatious building . It had inlaid marble floors , a rooftop promenade with gazebos , an English baronial dining hall and a uniformed staff of 150 . But then the Dakota was no more extravagant than the age in which it was built . Although the building looked out over a vista of squatters ' shacks in Central Park , society 's reigning Four Hundred might spend $200,000 on a single ball . <P> Birmingham 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thought that the entire building belonged to Music Publisher Gustav Schirmer . " No wonder we composers are so poor , " he wrote in his diary . " Mr. Schirmer is rich beyond dreams . He lives in a palace bigger than the Czar 's ! " There was also old Miss Leo , who lived in a 17-room apartment with her favorite carriage horse , stuffed and mounted , and Princess Mona Faisal , who , when asked her occupation , wrote " Saudi Arabia .
