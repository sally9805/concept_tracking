 | On deck he walked aft , sniffing the sluggish breeze and searching the horizon . The sky was clear , but a dim yellow haze thickened the air . The captain squinted . Way in the distance , high thin strands of cirrus clouds crept across the sky . The first mate , a young bearded Scot , stood at the helm , guiding the ship through the long swells . He nodded casually as the captain approached . " Trim the main ? " asked the captain . " Aye , and the mizzen . She 's slacked way off . " " Not for long . There 's weather . " " How big ? " " Ca n't tell . Not with this damn radio silence ; this war goes on much longer , we 'll forget how to use the bloody radio . But big , I 'd venture . The glass is takin ' quite a plunge . " The mate looked at his watch . " How much farther we got to go ? " " Fifty , sixty mile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have a look . Maybe try for Hamilton , maybe put into St. George 's . " " Nae worry , " said the mate , smiling and patting the wheel . " She can ride ' er out . " The captain spat on the deck . " This old wreck ? Only fitting thing about her 's her name . She 's big and clumsy as the other Goliath . " He looked at the sky . " Well , at least we 're ' cross the bloody Stream . " By one o'clock in the afternoon , thick , gray alto-stratus clouds covered the sky . The wind had risen to thirty knots , and it whipped whitecaps across the surface of the  | ocean and churned up heavy seas that broke over Goliath 's bow , sending shudders the length of the wooden hull . There had been two short blinding rain squalls , and another black mass of clouds was moving in from the southeast . The captain , dressed now in oilskins , stood next to the mate as he strained to steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wiry man  --  shirtless and sopping wet  --  hurried aft and stood before the captain . " They secure ? " said the captain . " Aye , " said the bosun 's mate . " But knowin ' what they 're worth , why they packed them things in cigar boxes I 'll never know . Muckin ' about with ' em is like dancin ' on eggs . " " Any breakage ? " " Ai n't seen any . They 're bagged about with sacks of flour . " The first fat drops of rain struck the captain in the face . " Keep her on one-two-oh , " he said to the mate . " I 'm gon na shorten down some more . If I 'm right , this bitch ai n't begun to blow . " Suddenly the wind shifted again , backing around to the southeast . It blew harder , howling through the rigging , driving a stinging rain . " Gim me oh-two-oh ! " the captain yelled above the shriek of the gale . " We could lay off ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a wave . Somewhere forward , a piece of wood snapped free and flew aft , rattling between the stays .  | The captain leaned closer to the mate and shouted , " Nobody lays off Bermuda in weather like this ! There are places them reefs come out twelve miles ! " Goliath struggled northeast for another hour , yawing before the following wind . With each thudding sea , the hull groaned and creaked . At three o'clock the wind let up a little , and the rain , which had been slashing almost horizontally , fell more vertically . The dead-gray sky began to brighten . The captain changed course again , heading southeast for half an hour to try to clear the southern coast to the Narrows  --  the only safe channel into the shelter of the Bermuda archipelago . " We may beat this bugger yet , " he shouted to the mate , who smiled and licked salt spray off his lips . An hour later , the storm exploded out of the northeast . The wind roared down on the ship , ripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered over the masts . Only two sails were still flying . The forestaysail went first , tearing off its stays and leaving shreds that whistled in the blow . A huge wave caught the bow and flung the ship skyward . At the crest of the wave , the captain spied a lighthouse  --  not lighted , for the wartime black-out was in effect , but conspicuous as a thin white stripe against the blackening sky . He turned to yell something to the mate , as the ship slid off the crest into the trough between waves . A wall of water struck , surged across the deck , and battered the captain  | to his knees . He thrashed frantically , groping for a handhold . His arms found the wheelbox , and he clung to it . Hearing a scream , he looked up . The wheel was spinning free , and as he watched , the mate was hurled into the frothy blackness . The captain lurched to his feet and grabbed the wheel . The ship rose high on another crest , and again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make way . If he could reach the lighthouse , he could get into the safety of St. George 's harbor . The spanker held . Careening into the seas , the ship began to move due north . At the crest of each wave , the captain shielded his eyes against needles of rain and spray . He fixed his bow a few points to starboard of the lighthouse . Something moved in the darkness amidships . At first , the captain thought it was flotsam washing aft . Then he saw it was a man , the bosun 's mate , crawling toward him , moving from handhold to handhold , winch to cleat to stay , to keep from being washed overboard . When he was a few feet from the captain , the bosun 's mate yelled . All the captain heard was the word " David 's . " He nodded and pointed ahead . The bosun 's mate grimaced and came closer . " That ai n't Saint David 's light ! " he screamed . " It is that ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't Saint David 's ! That 's bloody Gibb 's Hill ! " " No ! " " It 's Gibb 's Hill ! Look dead ahead ! " 5  | The captain peered into the darkness . Beyond the bow , not fifty yards away , he saw what the bosun 's mate was pointing at : a jagged line of surf , marking the reef . Confused , blinded by rain , the captain had let his ship be blown twelve miles off course to the southwest . He spun the wheel hard to port , and the ship began to bear off the wind . For a moment , the captain thought he had cleared the reef . And then he felt the first sickening crunch of timber cracking on coral . The ship jolted to a stop , then jerked forward . It stopped again , and again moved forward . The bow rose , then seemed suddenly to drop away . The deckhouse amidships heaved up ; the stern rolled off to port . The captain stumbled , reached for the wheel , and missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist jammed against the wheelbox . For a second , his elbow fought the wheel . Then the elbow broke , the arm was cast free , and the captain was pitched into the sea . By morning , the storm had passed . A British naval officer was walking his dog on the beach below the high cliffs from which the Orange Grove Club overlooked the ocean . Always after a storm the beach was littered with debris , but this morning 's accumulation was extraordinary . The dog sniffed curiously at pieces of wreck . It started to lift a leg on a piece of wood , then scented something unusual . The dog whined and grew excited , darting forward and back . It stopped at a large hatch cover and dug at the sand beneath it . The navy man followed the dog and , to humor it , lifted the hatch cover . 6  | Underneath , half buried in the sand , was a man , clad only in torn remnants of a pair of shorts . Water ran from his mouth , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The navy man bent down and touched him , and the man emitted a rasping , gurgling sound . He moaned , and his eyelids fluttered . The man 's name was Adam Coffin . 7  | In sea water more than a few feet deep , blood is green . Water filters the light from above , seeming to consume the colors of the spectrum shade by shade . Red is the first to succumb , to disappear . Green lasts longer . But then , below ioo feet , green , too , fades away , leaving blue . In the twilight depths ? 18o , 20o feet , and beyond  --  blood looks black . David Sanders sat on the sandy bottom and watched green fluid ooze from the back of a wounded fish . It was a big porgy , with long fanglike teeth ; it was at least two feet long , and mottled blue and gray . A crescent of flesh had been gouged from its back  --  by another fish , perhaps  --  and 9  | blood pulsed from the wound in stringy billows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erratically , apparently confused by pain or by the scent of its own blood . Sanders pushed off the bottom and swam toward the porgy , expecting it to retreat . But the fish continued to dart back and forth . He swam to within three feet of the struggling fish ; when the fish did not retreat , Sanders decided to try to catch it . With his bare hand , he grabbed for it , just forward of the tail . His touch triggered panic in the fish . It began to thrash in a flurry of convulsive writhing . Sanders held on . The fish was a shuddering gray blur . Sanders closed his eyes and tightened his grip . And then suddenly he felt a stab of pain . Shocked , he opened his eyes and tried to release his grip , but now the fish had him : its front teeth sank into the palm of Sanders ' hand . He yelled into his face mask and yanked his hand downward . The teeth came free , and the fish darted away . Green fluid billowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up , fighting the urge to shoot for the surface . On the surface , twenty-five or thirty feet away , the Boston Whaler bobbed at anchor . He took a deep breath , cursing himself . Trying to remain calm , he thought : Do n't panic ; do n't rush for the surface ; do n't hold your breath ; let it out nice and easy . He kicked upward , trailing blood , forcing himself to rise no faster than the bubbles vented from his air tank .  | Gail Sanders , sitting in the Whaler , heard her husband before she saw him : his bubbles popped and burbled on the surface . When his head broke water , she grabbed the neck of his scuba tank and , after he had unfastened the belt and one shoulder strap , hauled the tank aboard the boat . " See anything ? " she asked . Sanders pushed his face mask up onto his forehead . " Nothing . Sand and coral . There 's no wreck down there . " He was holding the Whaler with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gunwale . " What happened ? " Sanders was embarrassed , and he said , " It 's nothing . " Kicking with his flippers , he heaved himself into the boat and looked toward shore , two or three hundred yards away . Atop the cliff beyond the beach , the pastel orange buildings of the Orange Grove Club shone brightly in the afternoon sun . He raised his arm and pointed straight ahead , then aimed with the other arm at a lighthouse in the distance . " The lifeguard said ten o'clock , right ? Put the club at twelve o'clock and Gibb 's Hill light at ten o'clock , and we should be right on top of it . " " Maybe it 's gone . After all , thirty years underwater . . . " " Yeah , but he was pretty positive you can still see the keelson and some of her frames . " Gail hesitated , then said , " The bell captain did say we could hire a guide . " " The hell with that . I can find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gail gestured at Sanders ' bleeding hand . " It might be smarter to have a guide . " " I do n't need a guide , " Sanders said , ignoring the ges-II  | ture . " Water 's water . As long as you do n't panic , you 're all right . " Gail looked off the stern . Forty yards away , a line of breakers indicated another reef . Behind that reef was another , and behind that one , still another . " If a ship was going to go on the rocks , would n't it hit the first rocks it came to and sink right there ? " " Maybe not . If there was a hell of a wind behind it , it could be driven over one or two reefs , bounce from one to another . " " So it could be on any of those reefs . " " It could . But the lifeguard said it was behind the first line . Maybe we 're not far enough behind it . " Sanders uncleated the anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of reef . When the boat was within ten yards of it , he secured the line again and adjusted the straps on his scuba harness . Gail said , " Are you sure you should dive again ? " " Why not ? I told you , that hand 's nothing . I 'll wrap it so it does n't bleed in the water and attract any enemies . " Gail began to assemble her equipment . She screwed her regulator to the valve on the top of her air tank , then turned the knob that opened the tank . With a sharp p f f t air rushed into the regulator . She pressed the purge button , to flush any residual water from the mouthpiece , and air hissed loudly from the rubber tube . She adjusted her weight belt , a nylon strap with three two-pound lead weights threaded on it ; then dipped her flippers in the water and slipped them on her feet , rinsed her mask , spat on the inside of the faceplate , and rubbed the saliva around I2  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright and checked the lengths of the harness straps . " Ready to give me a hand ? " she asked . She looked at Sanders and saw that he had not started to put on his tank . He had been watching her . " What 's the matter ? " He smiled and shook his head . " Nothing . I think I 'm losing my mind , that 's all . " " What do you mean ? " " I 've been sitting here , getting turned on just watching you spit in your mask . " Gail laughed . " You want to dive naked ? We could conduct an experiment . " " My research indicates , " Sanders said gravely , " that an ejaculation occurring more than thirty-three feet below sea level could cause a backup in the system , resulting in the blowing out of the brains . " He stood , picked up her tank , and held it until she had put her arms through the straps . She said , " There are no reserves on these tanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only twenty or twenty-five feet of water here , and you should be able to get an hour out of a tank . More , maybe , if you 're careful . " Gail sat on the gunwale , her back to the water , and took a breath from her mouthpiece . " Good air . " " It better be . If they 're giving us bad air , this 'll be one short honeymoon . " " How long will you be ? " " A minute . Go ahead over , but do n't go down till you 've had a good look around . You do n't want to be surprised by anything waiting down there . " 13  | Gail rolled backward off the gunwale and disappeared in a cloud of bubbles . Sanders found a piece of rag and wrapped it around his hand . Then he gathered together his gear , put it on , and went over the side . It took several seconds for his bubbles to dissipate and his vision to clear . Shafts of sunlight streaked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pellucid ; Sanders guessed he could see for more than a hundred feet . Treading water a few feet below the surface , he turned slowly around , searching the crepuscular limits of his vision for any potential danger . A pair of jacks darted in and out of the rocks . He looked down and saw Gail on the bottom , digging in the sand with her fingers . A small grouper hovered beside her , waiting for any morsels  --  worms or tiny crustaceans  --  that might float toward him in the cloud of sand stirred up by her digging . Sanders kicked slowly downward , swallowing to clear his ears as the pressure increased . When he reached bottom , he saw that they had landed in a kind of amphitheater , a bowl on three sides of which coral and rock rose steeply toward the surface . The fourth , the seaward side , was open . There the boat lay placidly on the surface , the anchor line angling down from way forward of Sanders to a spot in the rocks behind him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhalation and the bubbly rattle as he exhaled . He looked around , trying to discern shapes in the distance where transparent blue dwindled into dim mist . As always when he had not dived for several months , he felt a  | tingle of excitement , a mild but thrilling blend of agoraphobia and claustrophobia : he was alone and exposed on a wide plain of sand , certain that he could be seen by creatures he could not see ; yet he was encased , too , by thousands of tons of water whose gentle but insistent pressure he could feel on every inch of his body . He rose off the bottom and swam to his right , to the end of the line of rocks . Creeping along the rocks , he looked for anything that might signal the presence of a wreck : metal or glass or wood . He swam around the whole bowl and found nothing . Moving to the center of the bowl , toward Gail , he tapped her on the shoulder . When she looked up , he spread his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you think it is ? She shrugged and held up a piece of glass , the bottom of a bottle . He waved a hand contemptuously : Forget it , worthless . He motioned for her to follow . Together they swam to the left . At the edge of the bowl , the rocks and coral continued in a fairly straight line . A school of bright blue-and-yellow surgeonfish fluttered by . A streak of sunlight danced over a piece of mustard-colored coral , its surface smooth , inviting touch . Sanders pointed to it and shook his index finger , warning her away . Then he pantomimed the sensation of being burned . Gail nodded : fire coral , whose mucous skin caused terrible pain . They kicked their way along the reef , followed by the grouper , which evidently still harbored a primitive hope that something edible would result from their visit . Sanders felt a tug at his ankle . He looked back at Gail . Her eyes I5  | were wide , and she was breathing much faster than normal . She pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hanging motionless , staring at them with a white-rimmed black eye , an enormous barracuda . Its body was as sleek and shiny as a blade , its prognathous lower jaw ajar , showing a row of ragged , needle teeth . Sanders took Gail 's left hand , turned her diamond ring so the stone faced her palm , and balled her hand into a fist . For emphasis , he held up his own clenched fist . Gail nodded , tapped herself on the chest , and pointed upward . Sanders shook his head : No . Gail insisted , frowning at him . I 'm going up , she was saying ; you stay here if you want . She kicked hard for the surface . Sanders blew an annoyed breath and followed . " You want to quit ? " he said as they boarded the boat . " No . I want to rest for a minute . Barracudas give me the creeps . " " He was just passing by . But you should have left your ring in the boat . Flashing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They 'll mistake it for prey . The first time I ever dove on a reef , I had a brass buckle on my bathing suit . The instructor told me to cut it off . I said the hell with it ; I was n't about to ruin a fifteen-dollar bathing suit . So the guy took a knife and tied it to the end of a stick and set it in the sand , blade up . We were five or six feet away from the knife , and the instructor kept wiggling the stick , which made the blade flash in the sunlight . He only had to wiggle  | it four or five times before a big barracuda came by and stared at the knife . The instructor wiggled it again , and bango ! Faster'n you could see , that fish hit the knife . He hit it again and again , cut his mouth to ribbons , but every damn time the blade moved he 'd hit it again . And every time he hit it I imagined he was hitting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suit again , except in a pool . " Gail removed her rings and tucked them in a cubbyhole in the steering console . " One more thing , " Sanders said . " When there are just the two of us diving , one of us has to be the leader of the pack . " " Why do we need a leader ? " Gail thought he was kidding . " Are you on a power trip ? " " No , dammit , " Sanders said , more sharply than he had intended . " It 's just that underwater we have to do things together . We have to know where each other is , all the time . Like then : If that had been a shark instead of a barracuda , and you would n't listen to me and shot for the surface , we 'd be in a hell of a mess . " " A shark ! Around here ? " " Sure . Chances are they wo n't bother you , but they 're around . And if one does come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Like ? " " Like panicking and rushing for the surface . As long as you have air , the best thing to do is stay on the bottom and find shelter in the reef . As soon as you start for the surface 17  | ? especially if you 're scared and swimming in a hurry ? you become prey . And on the surface , you 're lunch . " " Suppose I run out of air . " " You share my air and we wait for a chance to come up together . Unless he 's a real monster , we 'd have a pretty good chance of making it to the boat . " Sanders saw that the talk of sharks was making Gail nervous . " Do n't worry , " he said . " Just do n't do anything without checking with me . " Gail looked at him and drew a deep breath . " Okay . " She put her face over the side and looked through her mask into the water . " You think that barracuda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look underwater for a moment more , scanning the bottom . She was about to take the mask out of the water when she saw something big and brown behind the boat . " Hey , what 's that ? " she said , passing the mask to Sanders . " Where ? " He leaned over the side . " Behind us . About as far as you can see . " " It 's a timber . I 'll be damned . There it is . " Sanders uncleated the anchor line and let the boat drift backward a few more yards . " Let 's have a look . " " What did the bell captain say it was called ? Goliath ? " " Yes . Goliath . " They went overboard together , and as soon as their bubbles had risen away , they could see debris on the bottom . A long thick timber lay at right angles to the reef . Rotten wooden planks littered the white sand . Sanders touched Gail 's shoulder and she looked at him . He grinned and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sign . She responded with the same sign . They swam along the bottom at the base of the reef . Gail found a rusted can , its seams burst and jagged . From a crevice in the rocks Sanders pulled a Coke bottle , intact . Gail lay on the bottom and dug beneath the near end of the big timber . She found a fork and part of a plate . Sanders saw something sticking out of the sand at the far end of the timber . He dug around it until he discovered what it was : the fluke of a huge anchor . Gail motioned that she was going up . He followed her . Treading water on the surface , Gail spat out her mouthpiece and said , " Let 's go over the reef . " " Why ? " " It looks like this is just the last bit of the bow . There 's got to be more of her on the other side . " " Okay . But be careful of the surge as you 're going over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't screw around . Head for the boat . " Seaward of the reef , the bottom looked like a trash heap . Pieces of wood , rusted iron , and coral-covered metal were scattered everywhere . From the sand Gail plucked a pewter cup . One side was caved in , and the handle was rippled with dents , but otherwise the cup was undamaged . At the foot of the reef , Sanders saw an impossibly round ring of coral . He picked it up , held it to his face , and smiled at Gail . It was the remains of a brass porthole . Gail dug in the area where she had found the cup , and soon she had amassed a small pile of flatware  --  forks and spoons and knives , all gnarled and scarred . 19  | She swam over to Sanders , who was poking in the crannies of the reef . Near the bottom of the reef there was a coral overhang : the coral stopped two or three feet from the sand , and there seemed to be a small cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shook his head  --  no  --  and held one hand with the other , telling her that something might be living in the cave , something that would grab a probing hand . They separated . Gail swam back to the area where she had found the forks and spoons ; Sanders continued to poke in the reef . He came to another cave , slightly larger than the one he had warned Gail away from . He bent down and peered beneath the coral overhang . It was forbiddingly dark inside , and he was about to turn away and look elsewhere when a glint , a tiny flicker of reflection , made him look again . Holding a rock to steady himself , he stared at the shimmering object , trying to guess what it could be . He looked at his rag-wrapped hand , and an image came to mind : a photograph he had seen of a man 's hand soon after it had been bitten by a moray eel . The flesh had been tattered , and the bone showed sickly white . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew he was breathing too fast . He felt fear ; he detested the feeling . He stared at his hand and willed it toward the mouth of the cave . Taking a deep breath , he shot his hand forward to the glitter . His fingers closed on something small , fragile ; he snapped his hand back out of the darkness . In his palm was a glass container about three inches long , tapered at both ends . It was full of a clear , yellowish liquid .  | As he backed away from the cave , Sanders noticed that drawing breath was becoming difficult . He swam over to Gail  --  stopping briefly to collect a few relics he had left at the base of the reef  --  and touched her . When she looked up , he drew a finger across his throat . She nodded and repeated the gesture . Sanders rose toward the surface . Gail lingered long enough to gather a handful of forks and spoons  --  already , after only a few minutes , the gentle current had covered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they crossed over the reef and swam to the boat . " Beautiful ! " Gail said , as she removed her weight belt and flippers . " That is fantastic . " In the bottom of the boat , next to Gail 's forks , spoons , and pewter cup , were the items Sanders had collected : a chipped , but whole , butter plate ; a rusted , dented flare pistol ; a straight razor ; and what looked like a pebbly lump of coal . " What 's that ? " she said , pointing to the lump . " There could be metal in it . When they stay in sea water for a long time , some metals develop this black stuff around them . Later on , we 'll bang it open with a hammer and see if there 's anything inside . " Sanders opened his right hand and withdrew the ampule from beneath the rag wrapped around it . " Look , " he said , and passed it to Gail . " What is it ? " " Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be broken off so a syringe could be stuck in to draw off the liquid . " " I wonder if it 's still good . " " Should be . It 's airtight , God knows . " 2I  | Sanders looked over the stern . " Tomorrow let 's bring a bag . I think there 's a lot more stuff down there . " When they reached the beach , the lifeguard  --  blond , deeply tanned , wearing a white T-shirt with a red cross on the back  --  was waiting for them in hip-deep water . He grabbed the bow , eased the boat up onto the sand , and helped them unload their gear . " See you got some goodies , " he said to Gail as he watched her pile their finds on a towel and twist the ends of the towel together , fashioning a sack . " Some , " Sanders answered . The lifeguard had annoyed him at their first meeting that morning , when Sanders had rented the Whaler from him . He was cocky and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's twenty-six years than to his own thirty-seven . And when the lifeguard spoke  --  even in answer to a question asked by Sanders  --  he looked at Gail . Sanders was convinced that the lifeguard was more interested in the sway of Gail 's breasts as she bent over than in any relics they had brought from the wreck . Sensing Sanders ' pique , the lifeguard said to him , " You find any shells ? " " Shells ? " " Artillery shells . Depth charges . You know . Explosives . " " Live explosives ? " " I 've always heard Goliath had a bunch of munitions on board . Maybe it 's all talk . " Sanders said , " We 'll look tomorrow . We 'd like to use the boat again . " 22  | " Sure , as long as the wind does n't go around to the south and start blowing . You do n't want to be on that reef in a strong south wind . " " No . Neither did Goliath . " Carrying their gear , Gail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink  --  tinted by millions of tiny hardshelled sea animals , called Foraminifera  --  and so fine that walking in it was like shuffling through talc . By the time they reached the base of the cliff , Sanders was sweating . His palms were wet , and he had difficulty holding the necks of the scuba tanks . He looked up at the cliff , one hundred feet of sheer coral and limestone . To the right was a narrow , twisting staircase that led to the top . To the left was an elevator  --  a four-foot-square cage that rode up and down on a steel pole embedded in a concrete base  --  installed decades earlier in a crevasse cut in the cliff . On a control panel in the cage there were two buttons , marked " up " and " down . " If the elevator malfunctioned , there was no alarm bell , no emergency button : the passengers ( three , at most ) had no choice but to wait until someone spotted them and called for help . At breakfast the Sanderses had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the elevator as they rode up from the beach at twilight . They were the last to leave the beach , so there was no one below to see them . During the night , the wind swung around to the southwest and freshened into a moderate gale . The pole quivered in the wind , shaking the cage and the couple within , like a pocketful of loose change . When in the morning they were finally found , the woman ( so went the story ) was dead from fright and ex-23  | posure , and the man had gone mad . He babbled to his rescuers about devils who had called to him in the darkness , about birds that had tried to peck out his eyes . On their way down to the beach , Gail had refused to ride in the elevator . " I get claustrophobia in office-building elevators , " she had said . " I 'd be a basket case before I reached the bottom in that thing . " Sanders had not argued , but he insisted on sending their air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out , " If we let one of them bong into the rocks and rupture , we 'll go up like a Roman candle . " Now he had no intention of walking up the staircase . He turned left , toward the elevator . Gail turned right . " You 're not going to walk up those stairs , " he said . " I sure am . What about you ? I thought you were afraid of heights . " " I 'm not afraid of heights , any more than I 'm afraid of airplanes . I do n't like either one , but I 'm not about to let them ruin my life . " " Well , I 'm still not getting in that bird cage . Come on . It 's good for your legs . " Sanders shook his head . " I 'll see you up there . " He loaded the gear into the elevator , closed the gate , and pushed the " up " button . There was a click , then the motor whirred , whined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliff , staring at the gray rock as it moved slowly by . When he had seen enough of the cliff , he turned around and faced the sea , forcing himself to look down . He saw the lifeguard wheeling the Whaler up the beach on a light dolly , and a couple lying on colored beach  | towels arranged next to each other in perfect symmetry ? looking , as they receded , like a postage stamp stuck to the pink sand . His mind barely registered the change in the pitch of the electric motor , rising from a whine to a complaint . When the cage bucked once , then stopped , he was not afraid ; he assumed that someone , somewhere , had pushed a " stop " button , and soon that same someone would push a " go " button . He waited . The motor was still racing , like an automobile engine in neutral with the accelerator pushed to the floor . Sanders pressed the " down " button . There was a click , but no change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another click . The elevator did not move . He looked up . There was no roof to the cage , and he could see the top of the cliff , perhaps fifteen feet away . When Gail got to the top of the stairs , she was breathing hard , and her thighs ached . She walked along the path for a few yards and was surprised to see that the elevator was n't there . Her first thought made her smile : David chickened out and was following her up the stairs . She returned to the staircase and looked down ; it was empty . Her next thought made beads of sweat break out on her forehead . She ran to where the elevator should have been and , supporting herself on a guardrail , leaned over the edge of the cliff . She was relieved : the cage was still there  --  at least it had n't pulled away from the pole and crashed to the bottom . Sanders had reached his hands through the bars in the cage and was gripping the pole . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It just stopped . " Gail looked at the machinery by the top of the elevator shaft . Two steel arms extended from concrete bases and encircled the pole . There was a large metal box , containing , she presumed , the motor . But there were no obvious controls , no buttons . " Do n't move ! " she said . " I 'll get help . " She ran into the lobby of the Orange Grove Club , ignoring sternly worded signs prohibiting " bathing costumes and bare feet " in the public rooms of the club . " The elevator 's stuck ! " she shouted as she approached the front desk . " My husband 's caught inside . " The elderly clerk at the front desk was dressed in a morning coat , and he seemed more concerned about Gail 's lack of clothing than about her alarm . All he said was " Yes . " " The elevator 's stuck ! My husband 's ? " " Yes , " the clerk said again . He picked up a telephone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gail said . " I am , madam . " He spoke into the phone . " Clarence ? It 's happened again , " he said , with a teasing I-told-you-so tone . He hung up and said to Gail , " Help will be along presently . " " What do you mean , presently ' ? " " Madam , " the clerk said stiffly , " if you 'd care to wait on the veranda . . . " He cast a disapproving eye on Gail 's bare midriff . As soon as Gail was outside , she started to run , and then she saw Sanders , waiting for her at the top of the cliff , a 26  | grin on his face . Gail ran to him , put her arms around him , and kissed him . " I was so worried . . . , " she said . " How did you make it work ? " " Make what work ? I shinnied up the pole . " " You did what ? " " Shinnied . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the edge of the cliff . The elevator was where it had been , their diving gear still inside . " Why ? " " I 'd never done it before . " She looked at him and felt a sudden rush of anger . " Are you trying to kill yourself ? " " Do n't be silly . It was a calculated risk . I thought I could do it , and I did . " " What if you 'd been wrong . " " Yeah , well , those are the chances you take . " He noticed the fury in her face . " C'm on , everything 's . . . " He saw her hand coming at him , and he ducked . Her fist grazed the top of his head . " For Christ sake ! " he said , raising his arm to ward off the second blow . He grabbed her , pinned her arms to her sides , and brought her to him . " Hey . . . nobody got hurt . " She struggled briefly , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you trying to impress ? " she said . As he started to answer , Sanders heard footsteps behind him . He turned to see an old black man carrying a ring of keys . The man was muttering . " What went wrong ? " Sanders asked . 27  | " Temp'amental like a baby . " The man searched for the key to open the metal box . " Does this happen often ? " The man did n't answer . He opened the box , reached inside , and flicked a switch . Immediately , the pitch of the motor dropped back to normal . The man pushed something else , and , after a couple of clicks , wheels began to turn . Within seconds , the elevator was at the top of the cliff . The man shut the door , turned the key in the lock , and started away . " Hey , " Sanders said . " What happened ? " " Never know . Maybe too hot , maybe too cold . " " It 's not going to fall off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If something ai n't just right , there 's clamps that suck right down on that pole like a old octopus . No , all that ever happen is she get stuck . If people just be patient , they be okay . " When the man had left , Sanders unloaded the diving gear . " Give me a hand with this ? " he said to Gail . She did n't move . She looked at him and said flatly , " Do n't you ever do something like that again . "  | Sanders stepped out of the shower , dried himself , and stood before the bathroom mirror . He tightened his pectoral and stomach muscles and was pleased to see the muscle fibers showing through the skin . He patted his stomach and smiled . The bathroom door opened behind him , and he felt a cool breeze that carried the aroma of Gail . Gently , Gail pinched the insignificant flesh that sat above his hipbones . " Do n't exercise too much , " she said . " I 'd hate it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sanders turned and kissed her . 29  | They dressed for dinner , and as they left the cottage , Sanders slammed the door , turned the key in the lock , and jiggled the doorknob to make sure the lock was fast . " Who 's going to steal anything ? " Gail asked . " Anybody . Cameras , diving gear  --  it 's expensive stuff . No point in making it easy to get at . " " Well , locking the door wo n't do any good . The maid has a key . " Holding hands , they walked along the path to the main building of the Orange Grove Club . It was like walking through a tropical nursery . Oleander , hibiscus , bougainvillaea , poinciana , and poinsettia , in a fusion of colors , crowded the sides of the path . Oranges and lemons dropped from trees in small well-tended groves . They passed a cluster of cottages similar to their own . The limestone buildings were painted orange  --  all but the roofs , which shone soft white in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen cleaner roofs ? " " They 'd better be clean . That 's what you drink off of . " " What do you mean ? " " There 's no well water on Bermuda , no underground streams , no rivers , no nothing . All the water comes from rain . It runs off the roofs into cisterns . " " I thought you said it never rains here . " " What I said was , there 's never been a year with less than three hundred and forty days of some sunshine . It rains a fair amount , even in summer . But the storms are sudden and squally , and they do n't last long . " " For someone who 's never been here , you 're full of groovy facts . "  | " National Geographic training , " Sanders said . " Life is nothing but the pursuit and capture of the elusive fact . " " Why did you quit the Geographic ? Writing for them sounds like it 'd be fun . " " Writing might have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't do , and I did n't write . I only made up captions . Legends , they call them . I went there because I wanted to live with wild apes , fight with crocodiles , and dive for wrecks no man had ever seen . Instead , I spent my days thinking up lines like , Calcutta : InSpot for India 's Teeming Millions . ' I never did anything . I was paid to abbreviate what other people did . " As they neared the club 's main building , another couple , younger , appeared on the path , walking toward them . Their gaits were awkward , for they had their arms around each other 's waists , and since the man was much taller than his bride , he had to shorten his steps into a mincing trot so she could keep up with him . As soon as he saw the young couple , Sanders dropped Gail 's hand . When the couple had passed , Gail said , " Why did you do that ? " " Do what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honeymooners make me nervous . " She took his arm and touched his shoulder with her head . " You 're one , too , you know . " " Yeah . But I 've already had one honeymoon . " " It 's my first , though , " Gail said . " Let me enjoy it . " They passed through the lobby  --  large , sedate , paneled in gleaming , close-grained cedar  --  and walked by the bil-3 '  | liard room , game room , card room , reading room , and bar on their way to the outdoor patio overlooking the ocean . They were shown to a table at the edge of the patio . The sun , setting behind them , lit the clouds on the horizon and made them glow bright pink . A waiter came to take their drink order . He was young , black , and there was a name on the tag on his breast pocket . He spoke in monosyllables and addressed them both  --  not disrespectfully  --  as " man . " As the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , " That must be a lousy job . " " Why ? " " What 's he have to look forward to ? Maybe , if he 's really good , he 'll become a headwaiter . " " What 's wrong with that ? " said Sanders . " It 's better than being out of work . " " Did you notice his name ? Slake . That does n't sound Bermudian . " " I do n't think there 's any such thing as a Bermudiansounding anything . There are black people with names like Bascomb who speak Saville Row British , and there are white folks who sound like they came out of a ghetto in Jamaica . I remember checking a Geographic caption with a guy , a fisherman , who was quoted as saying , Holiday tomorrow . There 's going to be a tempest . ' I thought , nobody says tempest ' any more . But by God , the man really talked that way . Ethnically , this place is a mess . " When their drinks came , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking out at the few patches of reef visible on the windless evening .  | Sanders reached into his pocket and took out the ampule he had found . " In the morning , let 's see if anyone around here can analyze this for us . I 'll bet you a dime it 's penicillin  --  from the sick bay . All ships carry that kind of stuff . " " I do n't think penicillin was that common till after the war . It looks more like a vaccine . Anyway , you 're on for a dime . " He started to hand the ampule to Gail to put in her purse when a voice behind them said , " Where did you get that ? " They turned and saw the waiter . Slake had menus in his hand . " I beg your pardon ? " Gail said . He seemed embarrassed by the abruptness of his question . " I 'm sorry . I saw the little glass , and I wondered where you found it . " Slake spoke in a musical accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck right off there . " " Goliath ? " " Yes . " Gail held up the ampule so Slake could see it more clearly . " Do you know what it is ? " Slake took the ampule and held it between his finger tips . A gas lamp burned behind him , and he twirled the ampule before the light . He gave it back to Gail and said , " I have no idea . " Sanders said , " Then why are you so interested ? " " I am interested in glass . It looked old . It is pretty . Excuse me . " Slake put the menus on the table and walked toward the kitchen . After dinner , the Sanderses walked , hand in hand , along 33  | the path back to their cottage . A quarter moon had risen , casting golden light on the leaves and flowers . The bushes were alive with the croaking of frogs . Sanders unlocked the door to the cottage and said , " Let 's have a brandy on the porch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so . " He pointed to a yellow light above the door . " These things are supposed to keep the bugs away . " He poured brandy into . the two bathroom glasses and carried them out to the porch . Gail was sitting in one of the two rattan chairs that flanked a small table . " It 's nice , " she said , sniffing the air . " There are a thousand different smells . " For several minutes , they sat and gazed at the sky and listened to the rustle of the breeze in the trees . " Are you ready for another thrilling fact from the files of the Geographic ? " Sanders said . " Sure . " " Back in the seventeenth century , this place was known as the Isle of Devils . " " Why ? " " How would I know ? My contract only calls for me to give you the whats . ' Someone else is paid to find out the whys . ' " Gail said , " I 'm going to yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the most sensual and suggestive yawn you have ever heard . It will promise wild , unimagined pleasures  | that will make me forget that you are a suicidal maniac . In short , it will be a real turn-on . " " Do it , " said Sanders . He closed his eyes and listened . He heard her embark on a low , moaning , feline yawn . It stopped  --  as suddenly as if someone had jammed a cork in her throat . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " Swallow your tongue ? " He opened his eyes and saw her staring out into the darkness . " What ? " " Someone 's out there . " " It 's the wind . " " No , it is n't . " Sanders walked to the edge of the patio . The path was empty . He turned back to Gail and said , " Nobody . " " Look . " Gail was pointing to something behind him . When Sanders looked again , he saw a man stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them , stopped a few yards from the porch , and said , " Excuse me . " He was a black man , dressed in a black suit . All I Sanders could see were his eyes and a patch of white shirt . " How long have you been there ? " Sanders said . " Sir ? I arrived this very moment . " " From the bushes ? " The man smiled . " That is the shortest way . The path is very roundabout . " His accent was crisp , establishment British . " What can we do for you ? " " I would like a word with you , if I may . " " Okay . But come up into the light . " The man , who looked about fifty , stepped onto the porch . His blue-black skin was wrinkled , and there were  | flecks of gray in his black hair . " My name is Tupper . Basil Tupper . I am the manager of a jewelry store in Hamilton . Drake 's . Perhaps you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique glass . " Sanders looked at Gail . " Lot of glass freaks in Bermuda . " Tupper said , " I understand you recently acquired a small item of glass from the wreck of the Goliath . I would like very much to see it . " " Why ? " " What 's all the curiosity about ? " Gail said , reaching for the purse beside her chair . " It 's just a medicine bottle . " " No curiosity , really , " said Tupper , " except to those of us interested in fine glass . A chap named Reinhardt worked with glass in Norfolk in the Mid-1940S . His work is relatively scarce . It 's not worth much in the open market , but in our small circle it 's quite a coup to have a piece of Reinhardt glass . " Gail found the ampule and handed it to Tupper . He held it to the light . " A nice piece , " he said . " Not outstanding , but a nice piece . " " It 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the place . " " True , but there is a tiny bubble at one end of the glass . That was Reinhardt 's signature . " " What 's in it ? " Gail asked . " I have no idea . It could be anything . That 's not my concern . " Gail smiled . " For someone who does n't care what 's inside , you 're studying it awfully carefully . " 36  | " I am studying the container , not the contents . The liquid looks yellow , but it might be quite clear . Reinhardt glass often imparts its own hue to liquids . " Tupper returned the ampule to Gail . " Very nice . I 'm prepared to offer you twenty dollars for it . " " Twenty dollars ! " said Sanders . " But it 's ? " " I know , that sounds like a lot . But as I said , in our little coterie there is a certain rivalry . I 'd like very much to be the first to have a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth more than ten dollars , but by offering you twenty I know I 'm offering more than most of the others could pay . Someone like your acquaintance , Slake , could n't possibly go higher than ten dollars . I am making what could be called a pre-emptive bid . " " Would you mind if we draw off some of the liquid ? " Gail said . " We 're interested in knowing what 's inside , even if you 're not . " " No , " Tupper said . " That 's quite impossible . To draw off the liquid , you would have to break an end of the piece . That would ruin its value . " " Then I 'm afraid there 's no sale , " Sanders said . " Thirty dollars , " Tupper said , abandoning his deferential charm . " No , " said Sanders . " Not even for fifty . " " You 're making a mistake , you know . No one else will offer you anywhere near that much . " " Then I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sanders said . " After all , you said yourself that it 's quite a coup to have a piece of Reinhardt glass . " Tupper glared at him , then nodded to Gail , said good 37  | night and backed off the porch . A few yards down the path he parted some bushes , stepped into the underbrush , and was gone . " What the hell do you make of that ? " Sanders said . Gail stood up . " Let 's go inside . If he could hang around in the bushes without our hearing him , God knows what else is creeping around out there . " They went into the cottage , and Sanders locked the door . " You believe him ? " " No . Do you ? " " - Who knows from Reinhardt glass ? " " If there 's such competition between glass nuts , " Gail said , " why would Slake have told him about the ampule ? He 'd have offered to buy it himself . No . I bet he is n't interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wonder why he did n't say so . " " I do n't know . I guess it 's pretty hard to pass yourself off as a liquid-collector . " " Have you got the rest of the stuff we found ? " " Sure , " Gail said . " Why ? " " Tomorrow , let 's see if we can find someone who knows something about the wreck . Maybe there 's an old manifest ; at least that 'd tell us what Goliath was carrying . " 38  | " There were no survivors ? " Gail said . " One , " replied the bell captain , a corpulent , middle-aged Briton , " but he 's about gone by these days . " " Gone by ? " The bell captain touched his head . " Dotty . He 'd tell you volumes , but two thirds of it would be fancy . There is one man who might be able to help you , Romer Treece . He 's been on every wreck off Bermuda ; found half of them himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is he in the phone book ? " Sanders asked . " He has no telephone . The only way to contact him is to go out to his home , on St. David 's Island . " 39  | " Okay . I saw some motorbikes out front . Are they for rent ? " " The little ones  --  the mobilettes  --  yes . " The bell captain paused . " Mr. Sanders . . . do you know about St. David 's ? " " What 's to know ? I 've seen it on the map . " " They 're not exactly . . . hospitable . . . out there . They do n't consider themselves Bermudians ; they 're St. David 's Islanders . There 's a bridge , the Severn Bridge , connecting the island to the rest of Bermuda . They 'd as soon it fell down and was never rebuilt . " Sanders laughed . " What are they , hermits ? " " No , but they 're a proud people , and a bit bitter , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government looks the other way . There 's a mutual agreement , I guess you could say a recompense for slavery . " " Slavery ? " " The ancestors of St. David 's Islanders were slaves . Half of them were Mahican Indians , troublemakers sent down by the American colonists . The other half were unruly Irish , shipped over by the British . Over the years they intermarried , and they created as hard a bloodline as you 'd care to see . " " They sound fascinating , " Gail said . " In daylight , ma'am . Do n't linger in St. David 's after dark . " Sanders said , " Thanks for the advice . I left our air tanks down in the equipment shed . Can we get them filled again ? " The bell captain did n't answer . He looked uneasy . " I  | . . . I meant to ask you , Mr. Sanders . " He held up two wallet cards . " The cards you gave me . Forgive my ignorance , but I 'm not familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said smoothly . " National Independent Divers Association . There are so many divers these days , NAUI and the Y ca n't handle them all . NIDA 's a new group . " " Of course . " The bell captain made a note on a pad . " It 's regulations . I hope you understand . " " No problem . " Gail and David went outside and ordered motorbikes from the Orange Grove cycle shop . While the clerk was filling out forms , Gail whispered , " What was that business with the cards ? " Sanders said , " I thought that might happen . They 're getting tighter every year . You ca n't get air without a certification card . " " But we 've never been certified . " " I know . I had the cards made in New York . " " What 's NIDA ? Is there such a thing ? " " Not that I know of . Do n't worry . They never check . They just have to have something to put on file . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gail said . " Yesterday was the first time I 've dived in a year . " " Who 's got fourteen Tuesday nights to waste in a swimming pool ? " Sanders put his arm around her waist . " You 'll be fine . " " It 's not just me I 'm worried about . " They listened to instructions about how to operate the 41  | motorbikes . The clerk pointed to a row of helmets and said , " What are your hat sizes ? " " Forget it , " Sanders said . " I hate those things . " " It 's the law . You have no choice . The police can confiscate the bikes . " " It seems to me , " Sanders said irritably , " that I should be able to decide for myself . . . " He stopped , feeling Gail 's hand on his arm . " Oh , all right . " Gail put the towel full of artifacts from Goliath in the basket on the rear fender of her bike and patted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They set off , heading northeast on South Road . The wind had gone around to the southeast , and as they putted along the road overlooking the south shore , Sanders pointed to the reefs : what yesterday had been a calm anchorage for the Whaler was now a churning boil of foam . Waves crashed on the rocks . Even shoreward of the reefs , the wind-whipped water gathered enough force to make surf on the beach . The road was crowded with small slow taxicabs , whose drivers  --  though they had known each other all their lives and saw each other every day  --  impulsively waved and honked their high-pitched , bleating horns at each other . There seemed to be no social order , no evident neighborhoods , among the houses they passed . Generally , the houses on the right side of the road , with spectacular ocean views , were large , well kept , and obviously expensive . Those on the left , nestled close together on hillsides , were smaller . Every puff of breeze was rich with thick aromas , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Devonshire and Smith 's Parishes , turned left on Harrington Sound Road , and followed the long causeway across Castle Harbour to St. George 's Island . A sign indicated the town of St. George to the left ; they went right , across the Severn Bridge , and rode along the narrow road paralleling the airport toward St. David 's . They had expected to ride into a tidy , contained community . What they found , instead , was a random assembly of limestone cottages connected by dirt paths . It was as if someone had taken a bagful of cottages ten thousand feet up into the air , and then emptied the bag carelessly , letting the contents scatter on the hillsides . Only one building seemed properly placed : a lighthouse at the top of a cliff . They stopped on the side of the road , and Sanders unfolded the map he had gotten at the hotel . " This is it , " he said . " It has to be . That 's St. David 's light up there . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those thousands of people . " He waved his arm at the hillside . There were no bicycles , no cars , no pedestrians . The town seemed deserted . Fifty yards away , beyond a turn , they saw a hand-lettered sign that said , " Kevin 's Lunch . " " It looks empty , " said Gail . There was no door on the frame of the shack , but the remains of a bead curtain hung in tatters from a reed pole across the top of the doorway . Sanders rapped with his knuckles on the wall . There was no response . " Anybody there ? " They walked through the doorway . " What you want ? " said a voice at the far end of a long 43  | counter . The man wore no shirt , his skin was dark brown , his belly fat and hairless . His eyes were black holes above globular cheeks . Sanders said , " We 're looking for Romer Treece . " " Not here . " " Where can we find him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're not tourists , " Sanders said . " That is n't why we want to see him . We want to ask him about a ship . " " He know ships , " the man said , less belligerently . " For sure . How bad you want to talk to him ? " " What ? " It took Sanders a moment to realize what Kevin meant . " Oh . Yes . " He took a five-dollar bill from his wallet and put it on the counter . " You not want to see him very bad . " Sanders started to say something , but he looked at Gail , and her expression said , Let 's get out of here . He put another five on the counter . " Is that bad enough ? " " Top of the hill , by the light . " Gail said , " He lives in the lighthouse ? " " Right there by . It 's his light . " The lighthouse sat on a flat promontory , so high above the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty feet above the ground . There was a well-marked path directing tourists to the front of the lighthouse . A small white house , surrounded by a picket fence , was nestled in the lee of the light . The word PRIVATE was painted on the gate . The Sanderses leaned their motorbikes against the  | fence , opened the gate , and walked down the short path toward the house . On each side of the front door , where there might have been flower beds , was a bathtub-size vat filled with a clear liquid . In the vats the Sanderses saw dozens of pieces of rusty metal  --  spikes , buckles , boxes , pistol barrels , and countless unfamiliar objects . Gail held up the towel-wrapped bundle . " You suppose that 's stuff like this ? " " Looks like it . That 's probably a chemical bath , to clean stuff off . " The front door to the house was open , but there was a screen door , closed and latched from inside . Sanders knocked on the frame and called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlets in the bloody lighthouse ! Tell you all you want to know . " The voice was deep , the accent similar to , but not identical with , English or Scots . " Mr. Treece , we 'd like to ask you about some things we found . " Sanders looked at Gail . When he turned back to the screen door , he found himself staring up into the face of the biggest man he had ever seen . He was nearly seven feet tall , and his chest was so immense that the sleeves of his T-shirt had begun to separate at the seams . His hair was black , cropped in a crew cut that rose from a sharp V in the middle of his forehead . His nose was long and thin , and it had a noticeable bend in the middle  --  as if it had been broken and never set . His face seemed triangular , an upside-down pyramid : wide , high cheekbones above hollow cheeks , a thin-lipped mouth above a sharp , jutting chin . His skin was brown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that betrayed 45  | the presence of blood other than Indian was the eyes : light powder-blue . " We 're not tourists , " Sanders said . " The man at Orange Grove said you might be willing to look at some things we got off a ship . " " What man ? " " The bell captain . " " Briscoe , " said Treece . " I 'm not his bloody handmaiden . " " He only said that no one else could help us , and that you might . " " What ship ? " " Goliath . " " Nothing worth a damn on that scow . Least if there is , no one 's ever found it . " Treece looked beyond them to the gate . " You rode all the way out here on those things ? " " Yes . " " Well , what 'd you find ? " Treece unlatched the screen door and stepped out onto the path , closing the door behind him . " Is that the stuff there ? " he said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gail handed him the bundle . Treece squatted down , set the towel on the path , opened it , and looked at the forks and spoons , the pewter cup , the razor , and the butter plate . " That 's Goliath trash , no question . " He stood up . " You got your answer . Was it worth the ride ? " Sanders said , " There was one other thing . " He motioned to Gail , and she took the ampule from her shirt pocket and passed it to Treece.  | Treece let the ampule rest in the palm of his hand . He stared at it , saying nothing . Sanders saw the muscles in his jaw move , as if he were gritting his teeth . Finally , Treece closed his hand around the ampule . He raised his head and looked at the sea . " God bloody damn ! " he said . " Thirty-two years , and finally the sonofabitch comes true . " " What ? " Treece spun on Sanders , cutting him off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Sanders stammered . " I said who else ! " " Last night , " he said , " a man tried to buy it from us . A black man . He said he was interested in the glass . And a waiter at the hotel saw it , too . " Treece laughed  --  a laugh of anger and contempt . " Glass . " He held his fist under Sanders ' face and opened it , forcing him to look at the ampule . " You know what 's in there ? Morphine , pure and sweet , enough to give a man a week 's holiday in the stars . It 's no surprise someone tried to buy it from you . It 's proof of the legend . " " What legend ? " Treece looked at Sanders , at Gail , then back at Sanders . " I 'd as soon not tell you , but now they know you found it , they 'll be letting you know soon enough . Come along . " They followed Treece around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , a large and airy room with a view of the sea . Bottles and vials of chemicals , Bunson burners and tools  --  dentist drills , forceps , knives , hammers , chisels  --  were strewn about everywhere , on the counters 47  | and on the one round table . He motioned them to chairs at the table . Gail 's throat was dry , and she said , " Could I have a glass of water ? " " If I can find a glass , " Treece said , rummaging around in the clutter on a counter . Gail saw a half-full glass on the table . " This 'll be fine , " she said , and she reached for the glass . " It does n't have to be cold . " Treece watched her , waiting until the glass was within an inch or two of her mouth . Then he laughed and said , " Jesus , girl , do n't drink that stuff . One sip and you 'll be in the history books . " Gail was startled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean your pipes out , that 's for certain . " He found a glass , filled it with tap water , and handed it to her . " Here . All this 'll do is rust you . " Sanders heard a growl behind him . He turned , not knowing what to expect , and saw a dog sitting on the window sill . It was a terrier of some kind , medium-size , its muzzle grizzled , and it snarled at Sanders . Treece said , " It 's all right , Charlotte , you dumb bitch . " The dog 's eyes did not move from Sanders . She growled again . " I said it 's all right ! " Treece grabbed the glass from Gail and flung the water in the dog 's face . The dog wagged her tail and licked the water from her whiskers . " You be nice . They 're not tourists . At least , not now . " The dog jumped down from the window sill and sniffed around Sanders ' pants .  | " She 's feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Treece said . " She likes to get her licks in first . " " Does she really bite ? " Gail asked , as the dog 's cold nose explored Sanders ' ankle . " I guess so ! She 's purebred tourist hound . " Treece leaned against the wall and said , " What do you know about Goliath ? " " Nothing , really , " Gail said . " Maybe one thing , " said Sanders . " The lifeguard on the beach said he had heard she was carrying ammunition . " " Aye , " said Treece . " That , too . Goliath was a cargo vessel , a wooden sailing ship carrying supplies to Europe during World War II . There was a sound purpose to using wooden ships , slow as they were . The hull would n't attract magnetic mines , and , under sail , she made no screw noise for U-boats to home on . Goliath was loaded . Her manifest listed a boodle of munitions and medical supplies . She went down in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dumped her guts all over the place . For weeks , folks gathered every Christ kind of crap you ever saw off the beach . I went down on her two-three times in the fifties and hauled a ton of brass off her  --  depth charges and artillery shells . There were radios all over the bottom . You never saw anything like it . But nobody ever found those medical supplies . " " What were they supposed to be ? " asked Gail . " Nobody knows for sure . The manifest said medical supplies , period . It could have been anything  --  sulfa , bandages , iodine , chloroform  --  anything . A couple of years  | after the war , though , forty-seven I think it was , a bloody great hurricane beat it all to rubble . Most people forgot about Goliath after that , but some did n't . " Sanders said , " The bell captain told us there was a survivor . " " Aye , one . He was damn near in worse shape than the wreck , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital he sold scraps from Goliath , and for drinks he 'd tell tales of the wreck . One night , he was in his cups and he spun a web about a fortune in drugs aboard Goliath . Thousands and thousands of ampules of morphine and opium , he said , carried in cigar boxes . He claimed to have been personally responsible for them , said he knew where they were but he 'd tell no man . A day later he was waylaid and thrashed by people wanting to know more about the drugs . He swore he 'd forgotten what he 'd said , claimed he did n't know anything about any drugs . He never told that story again . But once was enough . Rumor spread , and before long the rumor was that there were ten million dollars in drugs down there . People looked  --  Jesus , they did a bloody autopsy on the wreck with everything save tweezers ? but they never found a single ampule . Not till now . " " Why would one turn up now ? " Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living creature . She 's whimsical , the sea , a tease . She loves to fool you . She changes all the time . A storm can alter her face ; a change in current can cause her to heave her insides out . You can dive on a wreck one day and find nothing . The wind blows that night , and the next day , in the same spot , you find a carpet of gold coins . That 's happened . And we 've had four juicy blowups in the past six weeks . "  | Gail said , " David thought this ampule could have come from the sick bay . " " Goliath did n't have a sick bay . They likely carried some medicine for the crew , and if this were any other ship , I 'd write the ampule off as from the medicine chest . But not this one . The best hope is that you found the one and only ampule left . " " Why ? " asked Sanders . " Because there are people who 'd slit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there . How much did you tell that fellow last night ? " " Nothing . We did n't know anything , except that we found the ampule in the general area of Goliath . " Treece looked out the window . Finally he said , " Would you be willing to take another plunge , have another look ? Not today . The sea 'd turn a diver to hash . But tomor-row ? " Sanders looked at Gail . " Sure . " " It 's important to know if there 's anything more down there . If there is n't , fine . But if there is , I 'll want to get it up before every hophead between here and the Bahamas finds out about it and starts diving for a cheap charge . I 'd go myself , but that would be like running a flag up a pole . " Treece began to search through some cabinets . " Any time I get my feet wet , the papers start trumpeting about treasure . And now that someone knows there may be something on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead giveaway . " He reached deep into the back of a cabinet and brought out two fist-size rocks , which he put on the table . " If you come across another ampule , set one of these on 51  | the spot . The shiny chips are infrared reflectors . I 'll go down of a night with an infrared torch and poke around . " " Okay , " said Sanders . " We 'll go tomorrow . " " If the wind behaves . " Gail stood up , and as she lifted her bundle from the table , she noticed the black lump David had found . She pointed at it and said to Treece , " Is that coal ? " " No . " Treece picked up the lump . " It 's a sulfide of some kind . I can look inside for you , but there 's a risk of ruining it . " " That 's okay . " Treece took a hammer and chisel from the counter , sat down at the table , and set the black lump in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his huge , scarred hand ; his thumbnail was as big as the face of the hammer head . But he used the tools as gently and deftly as a gem-cutter . He probed the lump , chipping here and there , found a hairline crack near the center , and lined the chisel blade on the crack . He banged the chisel once , and the lump fell apart in two pieces . Examining the two halves , he smiled . " It 's a nice one . Ca n't quite read the date , but otherwise , it 's a dandy . " " What is it ? " said Sanders . " The bones of a piece of eight , ancestor of the bloody dollar . " " I do n't understand . " " Look . " Treece held the two halves of the lump to the light . In the black mass , Sanders saw the faint imprint of a cross , a castle , and a rampant lion . " That was once a silver coin . When it hit the briny , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all that 's left , a shadow . Silver does that , unless there 's a heap of it , or it lies up against iron . Then it 's preserved pretty well . " " You mean a Spanish piece of eight ? " said Gail . " It ca n't be . " " It is that , girl . Eight silver reals , as common as a shilling in those days . " Gail said , " It was worth a dollar ? " " No . What I meant was that it 's from the piece of eight that the dollar sign came . Look here . " Treece spread the dust from the black lump and drew in it with his finger . " Spanish accountants used to register pieces of eight like this : a P next to an 8 . That got to be a burden , so they shortened it like this . " He drew an 8 and a P together , rubbed out a few lines , and was left with : $ . " How old is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I could n't read the date . A couple of hundred years , anyway . " " It ca n't be ! " Treece laughed . " Do tell , " he said tolerantly . " Where did you find it ? " Gail said , " We found it on Goliath . " " Not possible . " Treece paused , then said quietly , " Goliath went bubbles in 1943 . She was carrying no Spanish coins . " " Well , that 's where we found it . David did . In the rocks . " " Ah well , " Treece said . " You do find them now and again . Sometimes they even kick up in the surf . " " Could there be more ? " Gail asked .  | " Aye . " Treece smiled . " And beneath that could be Atlantis . You found one coin  --  not even a coin , a skeleton of one . Imagine : Suppose there was an earthquake right now that broke off this bloody cliff and plunged us into the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the wreckage , and the first thing they find is a penny that spilled out of my pocket . Now , they 'd be fools to conclude that they 'd come upon the treasure hoard of some Bermuda panjandrum . " Sanders said , " But there could be more . " " Possible , aye , I wo n't deny it . There 's more mysteries hidden by the sea than you or I can fathom , and once in a while she unravels one , in her own time . But usually she just teases you , gives you trinkets to keep you interested . Then she spits in your eye . " " I read somewhere about a kid who was walking in the sand and scuffed up a fifty-thousand-dollar gold chain . " Treece nodded . " It happens . But if you wait around for it to happen to you , you 'll go mad . " " Should we look for more coins tomorrow ? " Gail asked . " No . You would n't recognize them if they fell on your foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock you see . " Treece led the Sanderses out the back door and around to the front of the house . The dog followed , sniffing and wagging her tail . " How will we get in touch with you ? " Sanders said . " As you did today . A long ride it may be , but it keeps visitors infrequent and sincere . In an emergency , you could ring my cousin Kevin . "  | " Not Kevin 's Lunch . We stopped for directions . " A hint of displeasure must have shown on Sanders ' face , for Treece laughed and said , " How much did they cost you ? " " Ten dollars . " " He is some kind of mercenary bastard , Kevin is . He 's all right , but if there 's a way to suck money from dirt , he 'll find it . " Gail said , " He seemed very . . . protective of you . " " He is . Most folks here are . It 's a tradition . " " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us Treeces is keeping the light . When the bloody bastards dumped us here as slaves in the eighteenth century , they put a sheriff and a band of thugs in charge of keeping us in line . But we did n't take well to slavery , and after a bit we scalped the sheriff and threw him and his lot to the fish . Then they jolly well let us be . We set our own order . A Treece was elected chief , for two reasons : We were always bigger than anybody else , and there were more Treeces around than anybody else , so we always had ample blood kin to help put down any dust-ups . It 's been this way for over a century . " " You 're the chief now ? " Gail said . " In a way . The job does n't amount to much . I arbitrate disputes , and I deal with the Bermudians whenever we have something to deal with them about , which is blessedly seldom . And I keep the light , which is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bad job , especially in the years before you take it . It 's like being the bloody Prince of Wales . When my father was alive , the Islanders paid for 55  | my education in England . There 's a feeling that the chief should be educated . I do n't know why : a degree is n't much help in thumping a rascal or returning a fellow 's stolen goat . " " There is crime here , then , " said Gail . " We were warned not to stay after dark . " " Not to speak of , at least not among St. David 's people . But the warning has merit : Off-islanders are fair game . " " And when you retire , " Gail said , " your son takes over ? " " He would , " Treece said evenly , " if I had a son . " The flatness of Treece 's tone embarrassed Gail . Sanders noticed her discomfort , and he said , " We 'll leave the ampule with you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool enough to come in here after it , and it 's for sure no dizzy bugger 's going to knock me down and try to rifle my pockets . " He moved to the gate . " Be sure you want to do this . You 're on holiday . There 's no reason for you to muck about with this if you 'd rather not . " " What could happen ? " Gail asked . " I imagine nothing . But you 're never sure what people will do when they smell money . Especially some of the black bastards around here . " Treece noticed that Gail started at the words " black bastards " and he said , " Racist . Prejudiced bugger . Fascist . No . I have no prejudice . But I do have my biases . And my reasons . The blacks on Bermuda have ample to complain about , and they do ample complaining . But they 've got a way to go before they earn my respect . " 56  | " But you ca n't ? " " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's not turn this into a symposium on ethnic attitudes . " He said to Treece , " See you tomorrow . " " Good . " Treece opened the gate for them and shut it after them . As soon as the gate was closed , the dog reared up on her hind legs , put her front paws on the fence , and began snarling and barking . Treece laughed . " You 're tourists again . " They walked their motorbikes down the hill toward the road in front of the lighthouse . " We should be sure we want to do this , " Gail said . " 1 ' 712 sure . What an opportunity to do something . I 'm sick of reading about what other people have done or writing about other people 's good times . You ca n't live your whole life vicariously . It 's like masturbating from cradle to grave . Anyway , all we 've agreed to do is dive tomorrow , which we want to do anyway , and see what 's there . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do next . But I 'm not walking away from this before we know more . " When David Sanders was seventeen , a junior in high school , his English class had been assigned Walden . Most of Sanders ' classmates found the book dull and lifeless , a collection of maxims to be underlined , memorized , regurgitated on an exam paper , and forgotten . But Sanders had found Thoreau 's attitudes toward life so inspiring that he had two :  | " . . . I wished to live deliberately , to front only the essential facts of life , and see if I could not learn what it had to teach , and not , when I came to die , discover that I had not lived . " Though they had chipped and faded with time , the plaques still hung over his desk . When he was a junior in college , Sanders went to a lecture by Jacques-Yves Cousteau , and by the end of the evening he knew that Cousteau 's was the life he wanted to live . He wrote letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred miles or more to hear Cousteau lecture and see one of his films . Once , after a lecture , he had spoken to Cousteau , who told him  --  graciously but firmly  --  that there were hundreds of applicants for positions aboard the Calypso and that unless Sanders had credentials as a marine scientist or underwater photographer , he had no chance of being considered . Immediately after graduating , Sanders entered the Army 's six-month program . When his active duty was over , he married the girl he had been dating since his sophomore year . He did n't particularly want to get married , but , now that it was obvious that he would have to seek routine employment , Sanders thought of marriage as an adventure : at least it was something he had never done before . David and Gloria moved to Washington . The romance of Camelot was in full flower , and David fancied himself in the Kennedy style . He swam , sailed , played touch football . He even brought with him a letter of recommendation from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at Harvard . He thought he might become a  | speech writer  --  junior , of course  --  sitting at Ted Sorenson 's right hand , writing quips for the Leader of the Free World . He was advised that the best way to get into the government was to take the Foreign Service examination . He passed the written exam but failed the orals . He never knew why he had failed , but he guessed that one of the examiners had disapproved when he responded to a question about his outside interests by saying , " Scuba diving and killer whales . " A letter from a friend of his father 's got him a job at the National Geographic . After a year of writing captions ? chafing at the sight of full-time writers returning , tanned and leathery , from exotic assignments  --  he asked his boss how long it would take him to become a staff writer . He was told there was no guarantee he would ever become a staff writer . The best way to demonstrate his talent to the editors , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece for the magazine . He quit his job and began to deluge the editors with one-paragraph story ideas about far-off places , but he soon discovered that before the editors would consider assigning a piece , they wanted an outline so extensive and so detailed that only someone intimately familiar with the place in question could prepare the outline . Sanders had never been west of the Mississippi , and the only place he had visited outside the continental United States was St. Croix . He started to work on a novel . He had written nearly twenty pages when Gloria announced that  --  despite the diligent use of every birth-control device known to science except abstinence  --  she was pregnant . 59  | Sanders first considered Wall Street during a glum , drunken evening with a college classmate . The bull market of the mid-sixties was just beginning , and Sanders ' classmate was making thirty thousand a year for doing , by his own admission , practically nothing . Certainly , Sanders reasoned , he was no less qualified than his classmate , and he found a roguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the Street . He moved to New York , rented an apartment in the East Seventies , read a few books , made a few contacts , and found a job  --  all in less than a month . To his surprise , Sanders liked the work . It was easy and exciting and remunerative . He was gregarious , liked to take chances with money , and his early successes ( accomplished simply by following the advice of more experienced brokers ) brought him as many clients as he chose to service . He was bright enough to realize that though the Dow might hit the fabulous 1,000 mark , something would eventually happen to bring the market down , so he learned about hedge funds and selling short . The slide that began in 1968 made him , on paper , reasonably well off . He took himself off salary and became a " customer 's man , " surviving solely on commissions received from buying and selling stocks for his clients . He was very good at his job ( he believed he had a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relished taking risks based on hunches ) , and three rival firms tried to hire him at handsome salaries . He refused , preferring the unpredictable life of the customer 's man . The fact that he never knew , from one month to the next , how much money he would make , excited him . He viewed it as freedom . If he 6o  | failed to make a living , he had no one to blame but himself . If ( as was the case ) he succeeded , there was no one with whom he had to share credit His wife , Gloria , however , regarded this freedom , this so-called courage , as madness . She was an orderly person who did not take chances , who liked to know exactly how much money would be in each of the envelopes she kept in a file drawer labeled " budget . " There was envelopes for food , clothing , toys , entertainment , and schoolbooks . By 1971 , Sanders had two children , a co-operative apartment on West Sixty-seventh Street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a happy man , but he was bored . Gloria bored him . She was interested in , and knowledgeable about , only two things : clothes and food . Their sex life had become routine and predictable . Gloria professed a fondness for sex , but she refused to discuss  --  let alone attempt  --  ways of making it more interesting . Sanders found himself , during love-mak- i ing , fantasizing about movie stars , secretaries , and Billie of Jean King . Soon his work began to bore him . He had proved to himself that he could make money in every kind of market , and he enjoyed both the making and the spending of money . But the challenge was gone . He grew restless and began to do careless things . He still dreamed , from time to time , of working with Cousteau . He kept himself in excellent physical condition , as if in anticipation of a phone call from Cousteau . But he was not satisfied with fine-tuning his body : he liked to test it . Once , he intentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he believed , a special diet he had concocted would strip off the poundage in three days . Another time , on a bet , he set out to run ten miles . He collapsed after six miles , but took consolation in a doctor-friend 's statement that  --  considering that Sanders had n't trained for the marathon  --  he should have collapsed after two or three miles . He saw a television show about hang-gliding  --  soaring through the air suspended from a giant kite  --  and determined to build himself a hang glider . He built it and intended to test it by jumping off an Adirondack cliff , until a hang-gliding expert convinced him that his kite was aerodynamically unsound : the wing struts were too weak and probably would have broken , causing the kite to fold up and Sanders to fall like a stone down the side of the mountain . There was only one week a year when he was n't bored , the week in winter when his children visited their grandparents , his wife went to an Arizona health spa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Caribbean . He met Gail at the Club Med on Guadalupe  --  or , rather , under the Club Med . They were on a guided diving tour of some coral gardens . The water was clear , and the sunlight brought out all the natural colors on the shallow reef . After a few minutes of following the meticulous guide , who stopped at every specimen of sea life and made sure each diver took a long look , Sanders left the group and let himself glide down the face of the reef toward the bottom . He was vaguely aware that he was not alone , but he paid no attention to the figure who followed him . He let himself float with the motion of the sea , turning in lazy circles . 62  | He swam along the base of the reef , peering in crannies . A small octopus darted across his path , squirting black fluid , and disappeared into the reef . Sanders swam to the hole the octopus had entered and was trying to coax it out of its den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and saw a woman 's face , white with fear , her eyes wide and bulging . She made the divers ' signal for " out of air , " a finger drawn across the throat in a slitting motion . He took a breath and handed her his mouthpiece . She breathed deeply twice and passed the mouthpiece back to him . Together they " buddy-breathed " to the surface . They reached the support boat and climbed aboard . " Thanks , " Gail said . " That 's an awful sensation  --  like sucking on an empty Coke bottle . " Sanders smiled and watched her as she dried herself with a towel . She was the most attractive woman he had ever seen ? not classically beautiful , but vibrantly , viscerally appealing . Her hair was short and light brown , streak-bleached by the sun . She was almost as tall as Sanders , nearly six feet . Her skin was smooth and flawless , except for an appendectomy scar that showed above the bottom of her bikini . Her tan seemed impossibly even : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her toes , the palms of her hands , and the tips of her breasts , which Sanders saw as she leaned over to stuff the towel under the seat . Her legs and arms were long and lithe . When she stood , the sinews in her calves and thighs moved as if her skin were paper . Her eyes were deep , brilliant blue . Gail saw him staring at her , and she smiled . " You deserve  | a reward , " she said . The tone of her voice was not extraordinary , but the way she spoke  --  with a breezy confidence  --  gave her words authority . " After all , you saved my life . " Sanders laughed . " You were n't in any real trouble . If I had n't been there , you probably could 've made it to the surface okay . There was only about fifty feet of water . " " Not me , " she said . " I would 've panicked . Held my breath or something . I do n't dive enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy you lunch . A deal ? " Sanders suddenly felt nervous . Never , not in high school or college or the years since , had a woman asked him for a date . He did n't know what to say , so he said , " Sure . " Her full name was Gail Sears . She was twenty-five , and she worked as an assistant editor at a small , prestigious New York publishing house that specialized in nonfiction books about social , economic , and political affairs . She was a member of Common Cause and Zero Population Growth . For the first year after her graduation from college she had shared an apartment with a friend , but now she lived alone . She described herself as a private person ? " I suppose you could say selfish . " After lunch , they played tennis , and if Sanders had n't been at the top of his serve-and-volley game , she would have beaten him . She stood at the base line and slugged long , low ground strokes that landed deep in the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a walk on the beach , and then  --  as naturally as if the act were the next event in the day 's athletic schedule  --  made noisy , sweaty love in Gail 's bungalow . 64  | When they had finished , that first time , Sanders raised himself on one elbow and looked at her . She smiled at him . Beads of perspiration glued strands of hair to her forehead . " I 'm glad you saved my life , " she said . " So am I. " Then he added , without really knowing why , " Are you married ? " She frowned . " What kind of dumb question is that ? " " I 'm sorry . I just wanted to know . " She said nothing for a long moment . " I almost was . But I came to my senses , thank God . " " Why thank God ' ? " " I would have been a disaster as a wife . He wanted kids ; I do n't , at least not yet . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he returned to New York , Sanders moved out of his apartment and filed for separation from his wife . He knew he would miss his children , and he did , but , gradually , his guilt faded and he was able to enjoy his afternoons with them without suffering such painful regret that they no longer lived with him . He had neither sought nor been offered a commitment of any kind from Gail . Though he knew he was in love with her , he also knew that to pursue her like a heartsick adolescent was to invite rejection . He took her to dinner twice before telling her he had left his wife , and when finally he did tell her , she did n't ask why . All she wanted to know was how Gloria had taken the news . He said she had taken it well : after a short , teary scene , she had acknowledged knowing that Sanders was unhappy and that the marriage was a shell . In fact , once her lawyer had convinced  | her that Sanders ' offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed  --  so generous that it left him without a single stock or bond  --  she had n't seemed upset at all . For the next several months , Sanders saw Gail as often as she would permit . He knew she was seeing other men , and he tortured himself with wild fantasies about what she was doing with them . But he was careful never to ask her about them , and she never volunteered any information . Though he and Gail talked about the future , about things they wanted to do together , places they wanted to go , they never discussed marriage . Practically , there was little point : Sanders was still legally married . Emotionally , he was afraid to talk about marriage , afraid that to suggest limiting Gail 's freedom might make her regard him as a threat to that freedom . Sanders had always thought of himself as a normally sensual person , but in those first months with Gail he discovered a reserve of raw lust so enormous that he occasionally wondered if he might be certified as a sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressing everything ? delight , anger , hunger , love , frustration , annoyance , even outrage . As an alcoholic can find any excuse for a drink , so Gail could make anything , from the first fallen leaf of autumn to the anniversary of Richard Nixon 's resignation , a reason for making love . The day Sanders ' divorce became final , he decided to ask Gail to marry him . He had examined his motives , and they seemed logical , if old-fashioned : he adored her ; he wanted to live with her ; and he needed the assurance  --  however 66  | symbolic  --  that she loved him enough to commit herself to him . But behind the curtain of logic there also lurked a shadow of challenge . She was young , widely courted , and , by her own admission , averse to marriage . If he proposed and she accepted , he would have achieved a certain conquest . He was terrified of , but prepared for , rejection , and he wanted to phrase his proposal in such a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted her to know that if she declined marriage , he would rather continue their current arrangement than stop seeing her . He intended to remind her of their several areas of compatibility . He compiled a list of twelve points , ending with the undeniable fact that it made financial sense for them to live in one apartment instead of two . He never got a chance to present his brief . They were having dinner at an Italian restaurant on Third Avenue , and after they had ordered , Sanders took the divorce papers from his pocket and held them up to Gail . " These came today , " he said . He picked an anchovy from the antipasto plate . " Wonderful ! " she said . " Let 's get married . " Stunned , Sanders dropped the anchovy into his glass of wine . " What ? " " Let 's get married . You 're free . I 'm free . I 've gotten everyone else out of my system . We love each other . It makes sense , does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's just that . . . " " I know . You 're too old for me . You think I 'm a sex fiend and that you 'll never be able to keep up with me. 67  | You do n't have any money any more . But I have a job . We 'll make out . " She paused . " Well , what do you say ? " They decided on Bermuda for their honeymoon because neither had been there and because it had good tennis courts , good swimming , and good scuba diving . 68  | The lifeguard stood at the water 's edge , holding the Boston Whaler on its dolly . " Going after more forks and knives ? " he said as the Sanderses approached . " Sure , " said David , " and we 'll look for some of those artillery shells you mentioned . " " You get a pretty good price for the brass . But be careful . From what I hear , they 're still live . " They slipped the boat into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they cruised toward the reef , Sanders asked Gail to take the wheel . He took a small flashlight from his pocket and sat on the forward seat . 69  | " What 's that for ? " Gail asked . " To see in the cave where that ampule was . " " It 's not waterproof . It 'll short out in a second . " " Watch . " Sanders took a plastic sandwich bag from another pocket , put the light into the bag , made a knot in the open end , and pulled it tight , then touched a switch on the light . It blinked on . " That should last . " " Genius , " Gail said . " Crude , but genius . " They found a niche in the reef , guided the boat through , and backed around until the bow faced the shore . Gail stood on the forward seat , ready to throw the anchor overboard , and sighted along her arms , reassuring herself that they had returned to the correct spot . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put on their equipment and went overboard . They swam to a patch of clear sand several yards seaward of the reef , sat on the bottom and peered at the rocks and coral , looking for the cave where the ampule had been found . The sun was almost directly overhead , and its light cut vertical rainbow shafts through the water . Shadows shifted , appearing and disappearing as spots of darkness in the reef . Sanders moved to the right . At the end of his vision , where the blue water darkened and the shapes of rocks grew fuzzy , he saw a shadow that seemed to remain constant . He tapped Gail and pointed to the shadow . She took the fl- - " light from her weight belt and pressed the switch . A 1T ? . ; am of yellow light flashed on the sand . The cave was much farther to the right than they had thought , but now , clinging to the coral overhang and looking around , they recognized several pieces of wreckage . 70  | They crowded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight 's beam from left to right . The cave was only a few feet deep , and it was empty , carpeted with smooth sand . Sanders looked at Gail and shook his head , saying : Nothing here . Gail handed him the flashlight and pointed to a spot in the sand . There was nothing visible , but as Sanders held the light for her , she waved her hand over the sand , fanning it into a cloud that cut visibility to six inches . She kept fanning in the pool of light , and soon she had made a depression two or three inches deep . She fanned again , and there  --  at the bottom of the dent in the sand  --  was a glimmer . Sanders put his face into the depression and with the tips of his fingers brushed sand away from the glint . It was an ampule , filled with a colorless liquid . It might have been empty , except that when he moved it , a bubble shifted within . Gently , he pried it from the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole he had made . He pushed sand into the hole until it was level once again , and then placed a rock marker on the spot . They left the cave and swam along the base of the reef . Now and then , Gail would stop by a rock or timber and flash the light beneath it or fan away the sand beside it . They found nothing . Gail moved farther along , then stopped to look for Sanders . He was behind her , digging at something in the reef . She swam to him and saw that he was using a rock to break off pieces of coral . Every few seconds he would stop hammering with the rock and would try to fit his hand into a hole . Finally , he managed to squeeze three fingers 7 1  | into the hole and , using them as tongs , picked out a piece of yellow metal . It was bent and dented , roughly the size of a fifty-cent piece . But as Sanders held it up for Gail to examine with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there was a concave lip around one edge , as if something had once been held inside . At four points on the lip there were empty pockets , each perhaps a quarter of an inch in diameter . The metal shone brightly , evidently undamaged by corrosion or marine growth . Sanders turned it over , and in the beam of light he saw the etched letters " E.F . " Holding the ampule in one hand and the piece of metal in the other , he started for the surface . When they were back in the boat , Sanders said , " I thought for a minute we might have found a gold doubloon . " " What do you think it is ? " " I do n't know . " Sanders thought . " Jewelry , I suppose . . . but Jesus , it 's awful clean to be old . You 'd think it would be worn away , or at least covered with something . " Sanders put the piece of metal aside and looked at the ampule . He held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different color from the other one . " His eyes focused on the ampule and did not see the figure standing on the Orange Grove cliffs . It was after six when the Sanderses reached Treece 's house . Treece came out and gestured for the Sanderses to follow him around to the back . " Did you find any more am-pules ? " 72  | " One , " said Sanders . " It looks like there 's different stuff in it . " Gail handed Treece the ampule . " It was in the same place as last time . " Treece nodded at Sanders . " You 're right ; different chemical . " " What is it ? " " I 'm not sure . It could be a number of things . A heroin mixture or some other opium-based liquid . Might even be another morphine solution . Did you mark it ? " " Yes , " Gail said . She gave Treece the remaining rock marker . " There were no others sprinkled around ? " " No , and that one was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " Treece said , " I best have a look tomorrow night . " " Do you want us along ? " Gail asked , half-hoping Treece would say no . Treece sensed her reluctance . " It 's up to , you . You 're welcome to come if you want . Or , you can cut ' now . " " You bet we 're coming , " Sanders said . He pointed to Gail 's purse . " Show him the other thing . " Treece studied the piece of metal carefully , running his finger around the lip on the inner edge . He squeezed it between thumb and forefinger , and the metal bent easily . " You found this where ? " " In some rocks , " Sanders said . " It was lodged pretty tight . I had to break some coral to get at it . " " You might have used the other rock to mark the spot . " " Why ? " 73  | Treece grinned at Sanders . " It 's gold . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " " No man threw that away . If you 'd dug deeper , you 'd like have found his bones . " " How come it is n't all crapped up ? " " That 's one of the marvels of gold , " said Treece . " It 's chemically impervious . You could put a fresh-minted gold coin in sea water and leave it there till the end of time , and when you went to fetch it on Judgment Day , it 'd be as good as new . Nothing grows on it ; nothing eats away at it. , , Gail asked , " What was it ? " " A cameo of some kind . " Treece pointed to the inner circle . " The picture or etching was in here . These " ? he touched , one by one , the four pockets on the rim ? " held pearls , the symbol of purity . The lad might have worn it around his neck . " " What does it mean ? " " Finding it ? Not anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks out there , somewhere  --  God knows where  --  and the tide washed this and the coin you found in over the reefs . Or a survivor might have tried to swim to shore and did n't make it . This is personal stuff , not ship 's treasure . " Treece seemed to ponder his own words . " But , dammit , those answers do n't sit right . " " Why ? " " I 've been all over those reefs for twenty years and more . I 'm not saying I know every inch of every Bermuda reef , but because of Goliath , that area I know . If there 's a 74  | ship out there , I 'd have seen a trace of it by now . Guns , the anchor , ballast rock  --  something . " " How old is it ? " Sanders said . " The cameo ? A couple of hundred years . " Treece turned it over in his hand . " It 's Spanish . And damn fine workmanship . Very carefully made . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bermuda would have been inhabited when the ship went down  --  if there is a ship . There could be records . " " It depends : if anyone saw it go down , if anyone survived , or if anyone 's salvaged it since . That 's the likeliest ? salvage . " " Why ? " " The incident would be over and done with . No need to prolong it with searches or detailed survivors ' accounts , so no pile of records . If I had to guess at the story , I 'd say the ship heaved up on the rocks during a storm , but did n't sink . Maybe a few people  --  this E.F . included  --  were washed overboard . When the wind died , they might have caulked her and refloated her . Or , if they could n't , they'd 've stripped her clean  --  guns , cargo , personal effects , everything  --  and left her on the rocks . Next big wind 'd hash her up and scatter the pieces all over the place . There 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointed . " So you think we 've found all there is ? " " That 's just a guess . " Treece handed the cameo to Gail . " What do you plan to do with it ? " " I had n't thought . Can I keep it ? " " Aye , but legally you ca n't take it off Bermuda , not un-75  | less you offer to sell it to the Bermuda Government and they decline . " " I do n't want to sell it ; I want to keep it . " " Then , girl , " Treece said with a smile , " you have two options : You can smuggle it out or you can become a Bermuda resident . " Sanders said , " When do you want to go tomorrow night ? " " Come up around sunset . My boat 's in a cove below . We can be on Goliath by full dark . " They rode down the hill , through St. David 's , and across the Severn Bridge . On the causeway separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two taxis coming from the airport , but otherwise the road was empty . As they passed signs directing tourists to the dolphin show at the Blue Grotto , a green Morris Minor pulled out of a dirt alley and closed to within twenty yards of them . The car had been behind them for several minutes when Sanders first noticed it in his rear-view mirror . He pulled as far to the left as he could without striking the coral wall by the side of the road . Ahead , the road bent to the right . As he rounded the turn , Sanders saw two motorbikes and a small truck coming toward them . He put out his right hand and signaled the green car to stay back . The vehicles passed , and now David and Gail were on a straight stretch of Harrington Sound Road . There was no oncoming traffic , so Sanders waved the green car ahead . But the car stayed back . Sanders heard the honk of a horn , and 76  | he looked in his mirror . A black taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and Sanders waved it forward . The taxi pulled out and passed the green car and the two motorbikes . Sanders throttled down and dropped back parallel with Gail . " That jerk wo n't pass ! " he called to her . " I know . There 's a driveway up ahead . Let 's pull over and let him go by . " Fifty yards ahead , Sanders saw a break in the thick bushes and a narrow road that led up a hill to a house ; there was a sign , " Innisfree . " He put out his arm to indicate a left turn and cut the motor until his bike was barely moving . He expected the green car to pull out and pass , but it slowed with him . Sanders and Gail stopped at the entrance to the driveway . The Morris moved ahead and turned sharply left , nosing into the bushes and cutting off any avenue of escape . A tall black man in a mechanic 's outfit opened the left-hand door and stepped out . The driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want ? " Sanders said . " Man want to see you , " the tall man replied . " What man ? " " Make no mind . Get in the car . " Sanders heard an engine noise , and he glanced down the road to his left . A station wagon was rounding a bend , coming toward them . It was heavily loaded and moving slowly . " Move ! " said the man . The station wagon was about twenty yards away ; in a 77  | couple of seconds , it would be abreast of the Morris . As if obeying , Sanders took a step toward the Morris , then suddenly darted sideways , sprang onto the hood of the 1VIorris , and , before the man could stop him , leaped into the air at the oncoming station wagon . He had a quick glimpse , through the windshield of the station wagon , of the driver 's shocked face . He heard the squeal of skidding tires . The station wagon was barely moving when Sanders landed on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his momentum prevented him from stopping ; he rolled off the hood and struck his face on the pavement . He tasted blood . Sanders scrambled to his feet and yelled , " Help ! " The station wagon was full of cricketers , all dressed in white . The driver , a young black , stuck his head out the window and screamed , " You crazy , man ! " Sanders pointed to the Morris . " They 're kidnaping us ! " " What ? " The tall man , now standing next to Gail , called , " Do n't pay him no mind , man . He 's smokin ' bad shit . " " No ! " Sanders said . " Help us ! They 're ? " " Crazy bastard ! " the driver yelled . " You gon ' get killed one day . " Then he said to the tall man , " You tourin ' some crazy bastards , Ronald . " He ducked his head inside the window and pressed the accelerator to the floor . Sanders reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his hand slipped off the steel . The road was empty in both directions . He debated running , but he did not want to leave Gail . 78  | The tall man , Ronald , snapped a switchblade knife open and held it at his waist , pointing at Sanders . " Move ! " he said . " Or I cut your ass . " He took Sanders ' arm and roughly pushed him toward the Morris . Sanders said , " At least let her go . " " Her , too . " Ronald opened the front door of the car and shoved Sanders inside . " What do I do with this ? " Gail said , holding the handle bars of her motorbike . " Drop it . " She released the handle bars , and the motorbike clattered to the pavement . She climbed into the back seat of the car . Ronald pushed both motorbikes into the underbrush , got in the back seat next to Gail , shut the door , and , cradling the knife in his lap , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . 79  | They traveled in silence . The windows were shut , and the air in the car quickly grew acrid with breath and sweat . As they passed a sign for the botanical gardens in Paget , Sanders rolled his window down . He felt the point of the knife press at the base of his neck and heard Ronald say , " Up . " He closed the window . They approached a traffic circle , where signs pointed to the right for Hamilton , straight ahead for Warwick and Southampton . A policeman stood in the center of the circle , directing the early-evening traffic . Sanders wondered if , as the driver slowed for the circle , he would have time to 8o  | open the door , roll out , and yell for help . Then he saw the driver wave at the policeman , and the policeman smiled and waved back . It was growing dark , and as they drove along South Road , never exceeding the 20 mph speed limit , Sanders could barely decipher signs for Elbow Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Beach Club . High on a hill he saw the huge Southampton Princess Hotel and then the Gibb 's Hill lighthouse . They had traveled almost the whole length of the island . The stuffy silence increased Sanders ' nervousness . " How much farther ? " he asked . " Shut up , " said Ronald . They crossed Somerset Bridge , and another fact from his Geographic past occurred to Sanders . He half-turned toward Gail and said , " That 's the smallest drawbridge in the world . It only opens wide enough to let a sailboat 's mast pass through . " Gail did not answer . Sanders ' escape attempt had shaken her , and she did not want to encourage another confrontation . Ronald motioned with his knife for Sanders to face front . " For whatever that 's worth , " Sanders said , turning back . The car went left off the main road , onto a dirt track , following a sign that said " Public Wharf . " They entered a clearing  --  a crowded square , filled with fish-and-vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square was a rickety dock to which half a dozen weathered , patched boats were moored . There were no other cars in SI  | the square , and children scampered so carelessly in front of the Morris that the driver had to creep along in first gear . He parked in front of what seemed to be a grocery store . Canned goods and fruit were piled high in the window . A penciled placard advertised bait and pork rind . Faded letters on the gray limestone said , " Teddy 's Market . " Two young black men were lounging by the doorway . One was casually flipping a hunting knife into the dirt . The other leaned against the doorjamb , arms folded , watching the green car ; his shirt was open to the waist , displaying a fresh red scar that ran from his right clavicle to below his left pectoral muscle  --  macho graffiti . There was something familiar about the man ; Sanders tried to place him , but could n't . " You come quiet , " said Ronald . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked his head toward the men at the door , then got out of the car and held the back door open for Gail . Sanders opened the front door and stepped out onto the dirt . A breeze was blowing across Ely 's Harbour , and it felt cool as it dried the sweat on his face . " Inside , " Ronald said . He followed them through the door , saying to the man with the scar , " What 's doin ' ? " " Waitin ' on you , man . " It was the inflection on the word " man " that made Sanders realize who the bearer of the scar was : Slake , the waiter from Orange Grove . Reflexively , Sanders turned to look at him , but he was pushed forward into the store . Stepping into the darkness of the store , David could see nothing . There seemed to be rows of merchandise on both 82  | sides of an aisle . Gradually , as his pupils adjusted , he saw a faint light shining under a door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald brushed past him . " You follow me . " When he reached the door , he rapped once , then twice . A voice inside said , " Come . " Ronald opened the door and motioned Gail and David through . He followed them , shut the door , and leaned against it . On the far side of the room was a desk , and behind it sat a young man  --  in his late twenties or very early thirties , Sanders guessed . The sweat on his forehead caught the light and made his black skin shine . He wore gold-rimmed spectacles and a starched white shirt . There was no jewelry on his hands , but around his neck was a thin gold chain that held an inch-long gold feather . Two burly men ? older than the ones outside the store  --  flanked him in formal symmetry , arms folded , beside the desk . The room was cluttered with cartons and boxes and file cabinets , and smelled of fish and dirt and sweat and overripe fruit . Two bare light bulbs hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Mr. and Mrs. Sanders , " he said , smiling . " I am glad you agreed to come . " Sanders recognized the man 's accent ; he had heard it in Guadalupe ; the accent of one whose native language is Caribbean French and who has learned English in a church school . " We were n't exactly invited , " Sanders said . " No . But I 'm glad you chose not to resist . I am Henri Cloche . " He paused , expecting the Sanderses to recognize 83  | the name . When they did not react , he went on . " The name means nothing ? So much the better . " He looked at Gail . " Forgive me , madam . You would like a chair ? " " No . " Gail looked directly at Cloche , hoping he would not see she was afraid . " Why are we here ? " " Of course , " said Cloche . He held out his hand . " The ampule . " Sanders said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , from David to Gail , smiling , holding out his hand . He snapped his fingers . Sanders felt strong hands grip his arms and pin his elbows back . One of the men beside the desk stepped over to him , grabbed the collar of his shirt , and tore it open , stripping the buttons away . The hands behind him pulled the shirt off his back . The other man made a move toward Gail , but Cloche stopped him with a wave of his hand . " Take your clothes off , " he said . " Both of you . Now . " Gail forced herself to keep looking at Cloche . Slowly , she unbuttoned her blouse and dropped it to the floor . One of Cloche 's men picked it up and examined it , feeling along the seams , bending the built-in collar stays . She unhooked her short , wrap-around skirt . The man held out his hand for it , but she dropped it on the floor at his feet . Still looking at Cloche , her eyes locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man caught it before it hit the floor , and he picked through the cups , checking the thin padding . Sanders undressed less meticulously , shedding his clothes and letting the hands behind him take them from him . It was not until he was naked that he noticed Gail staring at 84  | Cloche . Her thumbs were hitched in her bikini underpants . He tried not to look at her , but the palpable excitement of the gawking men was contagious , and he sensed heat rushing into his groin . He closed his eyes , fighting the absurd tumescence . Cloche had not taken his eyes off Gail 's face . " Nothing , " said the man behind Sanders . The word broke the trance , and Cloche 's eyes dropped down Gail 's body . He looked away . " Put your clothes on , " he said . Gail bent over to gather her clothes . " I could conduct a proper examination of you both , " Cloche said testily , " but never mind . I assume Romer Treece has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then why all this cloak-and-dagger stuff ? " Sanders said as he pulled on his trousers . " Do you know Bermuda , Mr. Sanders ? " " Some . " " Then you will recall , perhaps , the ex-governor  --  the late governor , I should say  --  the one who was so fond of great Danes . " Sanders remembered . On a warm night in I973 , Sir Richard Sharples , the British governor of Bermuda , had gone for a late-night stroll with his pet Dane . Man and dog were found slaughtered in the gardens of Government House . " What does that have to do with us ? " he said . " He was a meddler . He refused to do business . I do n't like it when someone I approach refuses to do business . " " Business ? " " I wanted to see the ampule solely to confirm my suspi-85  | cions about it . The fact that you do n't have it , that you have entrusted it to Romer Treece for safekeeping  --  I assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite adequately . How many more ampules are there ? " " I do n't know . " " How many did you find ? " Sanders looked at Gail , but her impassive expression did not change . " Two . " " Do you know what they contain ? " " Not for sure , no . " " But you know the legend . Or , rather , the story , since the legend seems to be coming true . " " Yes . " JI " Mr. Sanders , I am determined to acquire every ampule down there . Every last one of them . " " Why ? " " They are valuable . We need them . " " For what ? " " Never mind . It 's no concern of yours . " Gail said , " Who are you going to sell them to ? Kids ? " Cloche smiled . " How nice to see your interest finally piqued . But that , too , is no concern of yours . In fact , the less you know , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need us , " Sanders said . " You dive . And you know exactly where they are . " " No . We know where two of them were . There 's no saying that there are any more . Besides , there are divers who know this area a hell of a lot better than we do . " " Perhaps . But it is testimony to British foresight that very few of those divers are black . Just as they have successfully 86  | kept the blacks from the professions , so they have kept most of them from becoming first-rate divers . I could import someone , but any qualified diver who came through customs  --  any black diver , that is  --  would come under immediate suspicion . You are here , you are tourists , you are white . You are above suspicion . " Gail said , " We 're not pushers . " " Pushers ? " Cloche was unfamiliar with the word . " Ah , vendeurs de mart . Nor am I. I am first a politician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . I am also a businessman , and I am aware that in dealing with people unacquainted or unsympathetic with one 's political ends , one must appeal to different desires . Therefore , I am prepared to deal with you . " He paused and looked at Sanders . " You will discover how many ampules there are . If there are only a few  --  if the legend is , indeed , a legend ? you will tell me and no one else . Your reward will be continued good health and a carefree Bermuda holiday . If , on the other hand , there is a multitude of ampules , you will recover them . We will , of course , provide you with whatever assistance you need . " Cloche turned toward Gail . " Once the ampules are in our hands , you will leave Bermuda . You will go to New York and you will call a : xelephone number I will have given you . You will leave instructions as to where in the world , six months from that date , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your choice . " Gail drew a quick , startled breath . Cloche smiled , then looked at Sanders , who gazed back at him without expression . " No , " said Sanders . 87  | " Do n't be hasty , Mr. Sanders . I see by your lip that you have a tendency to be hasty . " Sanders ran his tongue over his lower lip . A tender lump had risen , and the saliva made it sting . " Think about it , " Cloche said . " Think about freedom , about the freedom you can buy . . . with a million dollars . " He gestured to Ronald . " Where are their mobilettes ? " Ronald made a throwing motion . " The brush . " Cloche said to Sanders , " They will be returned in the morning . A final word : Make no mistake about it  --  should you still be inclined to be . . . hasty . . . and go to the authorities , you will find that , officially , I do not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaving Bermuda , you will also discover that , in reality , I exist everywhere . " His back stiffened . " There will be no haven . " He turned to Ronald . " Take them home . " There was no conversation in the car during the thirtyminute ride to the Orange Grove Club . Ronald and the driver sat in front , David and Gail in back . As they pulled onto the main road , Sanders rolled down his window . When Ronald did not object , Gail rolled hers down , too . The only sounds on the deserted road , other than the wind and the engine noise , were the calling of tree frogs and the chirruping of cicadas . The driver stopped the car at the entrance to Orange Grove . He did not offer to drive them to their cottage ; they did not ask . They walked silently up the driveway , stopping where the footpath to their cottage turned off to the right . " You hungry ? " said Sanders . 88  | " Hardly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sure use a drink . " Inside the cottage , Sanders tossed the key on the dresser and walked toward the bathroom , where there was a refrigerator . " Scotch ? " he said . " Fine . " He went into the bathroom , opened the refrigerator , pried some cubes loose from an old-fashioned ice tray , and dropped them into the two bathroom glasses . He heard Gail pick up the telephone , and he called , " I 'll have a turkey on white with lettuce and mayonnaise . " Gail did not answer . As he poured whiskey into the glasses , he heard Gail say into the phone , " Get me the police , please . " There was a pause . " Yes , that 's right . No , there 's nothing wrong . " She sounded annoyed . " Just get the police . " Sanders set the scotch bottle on the sink and hurried into the bedroom . " What are you doing ? " he said . " What 's it sound like ? " She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do with anything ? I assume this is a local call . " " Hang up , " Sanders said . " Let 's talk about it . " " What 's to talk about ? We were kidnaped , for God 's sake ! Threatened . " " Hang up ! " Sanders ordered . " Or I 'll hang up for you . " He held his index finger above the phone cradle . Gail looked at him . " I 'm not kidding . Hang up ! " Gail hesitated for a moment , then said into the phone , 89  | " That 's all right , operator . I 'll try again later . " She hung up . " Okay . So talk . " " Calm down , " Sanders said . He put his hand on her shoulder . She brushed the hand aside . " I wo n't calm down ! Do n't you realize what we were asked to do ? " " Sure ! " Sanders said as he went back into the bathroom to get the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cops is no answer . What are they going to do ? " " Arrest him . " " For what ? How are we going to prove anything ? You heard what he said : He does n't exist . At least not officially . Did n't you see that cop wave at the driver ? He 's probably got the whole damn police force in his pocket . " " Then let 's call the government . He sure as hell does n't have the British Government in his pocket . " " And tell them what ? " " We were kidnaped . That 's ? " " For an hour . By a phantom . We 'd have a hell of a time making a case out of that . " " Assault , then . You ca n't go around sticking knives at people and tearing off their clothes . And what about what he wants us to do ? Sell him narcotics . " " Not exactly . More like find them for him . " Gail looked at him for a long moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd really follow us ? " " I do n't know . We 'll have to find out if he could . Maybe Treece 'll have an idea . " " And maybe you 'll end up dead . " " C'm on , let 's not ... " 90  | Gail sneezed . As she folded her handkerchief , she noticed a smear of blood . " I 've still got a bloody nose , " she said . " What do you mean , still ' ? " " There was blood in my mask when I came up today . " They left Orange Grove after breakfast the next morning . Sometime during the night , as promised , their motorbikes had been returned and parked in front of their cottage . When she saw the motorbikes , Gail shivered involuntarily . " What 's the matter ? " Sanders said . " They were here . " " Who was ? " " Those men . While we slept . " " Sure they were . How else would they get the bikes back to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When they arrived at Treece 's house , they waited outside the gate and called to Treece . When he told them to come in , the dog bounded down the path and escorted them to the kitchen door . The kitchen table was covered with photostats of old documents . Treece saw Sanders looking at the papers , and he said , " Research . " " What are they ? " " Logs , manifests , bills of lading , diaries , letters . A dividend of my study in Europe . I spent my holidays . in the archives of Madrid , Cadiz , and Seville . Friends send me new papers as they surface . " p  | " What do they tell you ? " Gail asked . " What ships went to what ports , what they were carrying , who was on board , where they sank if they sank , how many people survived . They 're indispensable tools . Without them , you can dilly around on a wreck for months and not know what you 're looking at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The writing was in Spanish , and he could decipher only a few words  --  like artilleria and canones  --  and the date : 1714 . " What are you looking for ? " " I 'm indulging myself in a bit of nonsense . " " What do you mean ? " " I 'm trying to figure out if it 's possible that another ship did sink out there . That it went down with everything on it , and that it was never salvaged . " Gail said , " Is that possible ? " " It 's happened before . Two storms , a hundred or two hundred years apart , spring up from the same quarter , catch two ships in the same circumstance , making for the same shelter , and drive them up on the same reefs . " Treece shook his head . " What a mess . " " I think it sounds fantastic , " said Gail . " You do , do you ? Take a nice clean wreck  --  nothing else around , fairly well contained , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . You can spend a year mucking about in the sand and still not find a bloody thing . Now add to that another whole ship , all busted to pieces , and with a cargo of live ammunition . That 's some way to get your jollies . " " Have you found anything ? " said Sanders . 92  | " No . Not sure I will . " Treece patted the pile of papers . " All I 'm doing with this stuff is rooting around to see if I can find someone with the initials L.F. Probably a waste of time , but you have to start somewhere , and E.F . ' s all we 've got . Now . . . tell me what brings you all the way out here this early . We 're not going anywhere till tonight . " They told him about their meeting with Cloche . At the first mention of Cloche 's name , Treece started , as if a longawaited piece of bad news had finally arrived . " Oh , Jesus , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not interrupt . When they were finished , he said , " You were right not to ring the police . " " Why ? " said Gail . " They could n't have done anything . He 's a shadow , that man . He has friends in many strange places . I know what he can get away with . " He shook his head . " Damn . It is a robust piece of bad luck that we 're faced with him so soon . You 've never heard of him ? " " No , " Sanders said . " Should we have ? " " I suppose not . He 's got a dozen different names . He comes from Haiti , originally . That 's the myth , at least . It 's hard to separate fact from fancy about Cloche ; he 's built himself into a kind of folk hero among island blacks . A lot of them think he 's the reincarnation of Che Guevara . And not just here . All over . In the Windwards and Leewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush ? " Gail said . " Magic , voodoo . You 'll see little statues of her in the huts on the hillsides of Guadalupe and Martinique . They 93  | adore her , like . . . well , I imagine Eva Peron is a parallel . She was a chambermaid in a hotel in Haiti . At the age of forty-three , she came down with glaucoma , and when it got so bad she could n't see to work , the hotel fired her without a sou . Cloche himself was nothing but a busboy then , but he was clever . He took mamma into the woods and set her up as a symbol of white oppression . He spread stories about her , made her into an all-knowing black princess , said she cured the incurable and raised the dead  --  all the standard stuff . People wanted to believe in her  --  Christ , wanted ' is n't the word : longed to . Once mamma was established , Cloche began to pass himself off as her messenger . He 's been all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three times , spreading the message . Nobody knows if mamma 's still drawing breath , but Cloche is still spreading the word . " " What 's the word ? " asked Sanders . " It 's time for the blacks to get the biscuit . I suppose it was only a matter of time until he came back here . " " It does n't look to me like Bermuda 's ripe for revolt , " Sanders said . " It 's hard to tell . " Gail said , " The blacks are n't exactly what you 'd call equal here . " " No , but there 's been no serious trouble since the sixtyeight riots  --  aside from the Sharpies assassination , and there 's still no proof about that one . " " Cloche as much as admitted that his people killed Sharpies , " said Sanders . " Of course . Why should n't he ? No one else has been 94  | arrested , and it makes him seem like a bigger threat . It 's like those Arab fringe groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps up to take credit , claiming the crash was a revolutionary act . Crap . Of course Cloche may have killed Sharples ; I would n't put it past him . But the fact that he says he did does n't make it true . " Treece looked at Gail . " In any event , Bermuda has been fairly peaceful for some time . It 's a dicey peace , though . Blacks are the majority here , and they get less of the pie than the whites . For my money , they get more as they merit more , and they 're getting more all the time . But a chap like Cloche can rile them , convince them that they 're oppressed , that numbers alone are enough to merit more . Manipulate them for his own purposes . He 's a persuasive speaker , and they 're scared of him . Besides , there 's no trick to convincing people that they deserve more than they 've got . " " Is he a communist ? " Gail asked . " Hell , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his abilities , to each according to his needs , ' and all that . I think what he really wants is to set up some sort of island kingdom . He wo n't call it that , of course . It 'll be the People 's Republic of some goddamn thing . " " And the drugs ? " " Money . Power . I imagine he 'll try to sell the drugs in the States . " Treece paused . " I do n't want him to get them . " He looked at Sanders . " A million dollars ? He is anxious . Were you tempted ? " Sanders looked at Gail . " No , " he said . " Though God knows we could use the money . " 95  | " It 's a decent amount of cash , no doubting it , " Treece said , slapping the photostats in front of him . " But if I can find some parts to this puzzle and we really get lucky , there might be a like amount of real goodies down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a treasure ? " Gail said . " No . But I 'm not convinced there is n't . You never know till you 've had a good look . " " What do we do about Cloche ? " Sanders said . " Is there a way to get around him ? I do n't like the thought that he might follow us to New York . " " For the moment , there 's nothing to do . You 're stuck either way , until we know what 's really down there . We 'll have a look around tonight . If we do n't find any more ampules  --  and it 's possible these two are a fluke  --  you can deliver the two you found to Cloche and wish him well . If there 's nothing else there , I do n't think he 'll bother with you any more . With luck , that 's what 'll happen . But before we go down again , I want to talk to Adam Coffin . " " Who 's he ? " " The Goliath survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugs , but perhaps the sight of a couple of ampules will jar his memory . " Treece put the two ampules in his pocket . " Leave your bikes here . You 'll be coming back later to dive . We can all fit in Kevin 's car . " " About the diving , " Gail said . " My nose has been bleeding since yesterday . " " Bad ? " " No. " 96  | " Not to worry . When you have n't been wet in a while , a day or two of ups and downs will irritate the tissues in your sinuses . Stay out of the water for a bit , and it 'll clear up . " What about tonight ? " " I would n't . There 's no sense pushing it . The two of us can manage . " Treece opened the kitchen door for them . " You go ahead on your bikes , then . I 'll come by the hotel , and you can follow me down to Coffin 's . " The house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of weeds overlooking Hamilton Harbour . There was no driveway , only a dirt shoulder wide enough to permit one car to pull off the road and stop without risking a rear-end collision with the passing traffic . Treece nosed the Hillman into the brush beside the shoulder , leaving room behind for the two motorbikes . His immense frame looked ridiculous in the car : he was hunched forward so his head would n't jam into the roof , and his legs were so long and so cramped that he could not put them out of the car first . The only way he could get out was to open the door and fall to the right , supporting himself with his hands on the ground , dragging his legs after him . " Damn fool things , " he said as he wiped his hands on his pants . " Built for bloody midgets . " " If you ever had an accident in that car , " Sanders said , " they 'd have to cut you out with a torch . Why do n't you ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about them is they 97  | keep the black population down . " Treece looked at Gail and smiled . " Forgive me . I 'm a relentless bastard . " They walked up the dirt path to the house . A small man was on his hands and knees , digging in a flower bed beside the front door . " Adam , " Treece said . Coffin 's head snapped around . " Treece ! " he said , surprised . With a nimble motion he pushed himself backward and rolled to his feet . He wore nothing but a tattered pair of denim shorts . His body was tan , lean , and sinewy , without a trace of fat . Strands of aged muscle coursed along his arms and chest as visibly as a drawing in an anatomy text . His eyes were fixed in a permanent squint that had cut deep grooves in the dry brown skin on his cheeks and forehead . A shaggy mane of white hair hung down the back of his neck . He smiled at Treece , displaying abused gums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's good to see you ; been awhile . " " Aye , it has . " Treece enveloped Coffin 's bony fingers in his enormous fist and pumped once briskly up and down . " We stopped by to chat you up . " He introduced the Sanderses to Coffin . " Come in , then , " said Coffin , leading them into the dark house . The one-room house was divided by furniture into three sections . On the right there was a hammock , suspended catty-corner by two steel rings embedded in the stone wall . Behind a half-open curtain David saw a toilet and a sink . In the middle of the room was a single stuffed chair , 98  | facing a 1950s-vintage television set . On the left were a sink , a hot plate , a refrigerator , a cabinet , and a card table , around which were two chairs and two stools . " Sit , " said Coffin . He opened the cabinet and waved at an array of bottles . " Have a charge ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fury of the juniper berries . " Confused , Sanders looked at Treece and saw that he was grinning at Coffin . " I 'll have a spot of rum , " Treece said . " How long 've you been on the tack ? " " A good while now , " Coffin said . " It 's not hard if you have a disciplined soul . " He looked at Sanders . " For you ? " " A gin and tonic would be fine , " Sanders said . Gail nodded . " The same . Thank you . " " Comin ' up . " Coffin took four glasses from the cabinet , filled two of them with Bombay gin  --  no ice , no tonic ? and passed them to David and Gail . The other two he filled with dark Barbados rum . He gave one to Treece , took a long swallow from the other , and sat down . " I thought you were on the tack , " Treece said . " I am . Have n't had a drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's survival . Without it , your blood does n't circulate proper . That 's a fact . " Sanders took a sip of the warm gin and suppressed a grimace as the harsh liquid burned his throat . " So . Tell an old man what brings you by . " Coffin smiled . " Or is this just your day to visit the elderly and infirm ? " Treece reached in his pocket and , without a word , placed the two ampules on the table . Coffin did not touch them ; he simply stared at them and 99  | said nothing . He looked up , first at Treece , then at the Sanderses . His face showed no emotion , but there was something different about his eyes , a shininess that Sanders could not diagnose  --  excitement , perhaps , or fear . Or both . Coffin jerked his head toward the Sanderses and said to Treece , " How much do they know ? " " All I know . They found the pieces . " Then Treece told Coffin about Cloche 's proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when Treece had finished . " He should have come to me with his million dollars . They 're mine . " " You 're supposed to be a fool , Adam . Keep it that way . It 's safer . Besides , Goliath is n't registered to you any more . I checked . Now  --  truth . How many were there ? " Coffin hesitated . " Truth is a pain in the ass , " he said , holding one of the ampules to the light . " I told the truth once , and damn near got killed for my trouble . " " Cloche may come and finish the job , Adam , if we do n't get the stuff up and out of there fast . How many were there ? " Coffin finished his glass of rum , reached for the bottle , and refilled his glass . " They were in cigar boxes . Fortyeight to a box , separated by cardboard grids . The manifest said there were ten thousand boxes , and I believe it . I stacked every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the manifest say what was in the glass ? " " No , but we knew . Morphine , mostly . Some raw opium , a bit of Adrenalin . But almost all morphine . " " No heroin ? " Sanders asked . " No . At least ? " I00  | Gail interrupted . " It 's the same thing . " " What do you mean ? " Sanders said . " It is . I edited a book about drugs once . All heroin is , is morphine heated with acetic acid . As soon as it gets into the body , it 's reconverted into morphine . " " Then why do n't junkies take morphine ? " " It 's not up to them . They take what the pushers push , and the pushers push what the smugglers smuggle . The smugglers smuggle heroin because they make more money from it : a pound of pure morphine converts into more than a pound of heroin , and you do n't have to take as much heroin because it 's stronger than straight morphine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain . Anyway , if you figure that from that cargo you could make half a million doses of heroin , street value somewhere between ten and twenty dollars a dose , you 're talking about a total value of five to ten million dollars . Lord ! " Treece said , " Where was it carried , Adam ? " " Number three hold . The lot of it . Amidships . I had it bagged about with flour . " " Was there anything beneath it ? " " Aye , the ordnance . We chucked our ballast and put the cases of shells down there . It was a dicey sail , I tell you . One of the mates went in irons for three days for sneaking a cigarette . And that was topside . " " She did n't roll over when she went down , did she ? " " Not so far 's I know . But I did n't linger to see how she fell . " " So if her guts were ripped out clean , it 's likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cigar boxes would be atop them . " " Those boxes were wood , remember , and flimsy . They 'd be nothing now . " Treece nodded . " Still , they 'd not have been crushed by the cases of shells . And the ampules ' mass in water is almost nothing , so they 'd not have sunk deep in the sand . " " If you ask me , the storms has busted ' em all up by now. , , " I 'd have thought so , too . " Treece fingered one of the ampules . " Until these turned up . " " But they were in a hole , you say , protected . The others is gone , I 'll wager . " " Like as not . But we 're having a look tonight . " Coffin drained his glass and banged it on the table . " Damn fine . I 'll be ready . " Treece smiled . " No . We 'll go . If we find some more , then we 'll need you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest with a fist . " You think I 'm not fit , is that it ? " His eyes were bright , his face flushed from the rum . " I 'm fit as a bloody stallion ! How old do you think I am ? " Treece said calmly , " I know how old you are , Adam . " " You , then , " Coffin said , glaring at Sanders . " How old do you think I am ? " Sanders looked at him , quickly matching dates in his mind . Coffin had to be at least seventy . " I 'd say . . . sixty . " " See that , Treece ? " Coffin laughed . " Sixty ! " He turned back to Sanders . " I 'm seventy-bloody-two , my boy ! Fit as a stallion ! " " Adam , " Treece said , touching Coffin 's arm , " no one said IO2  | you were n't fit . But I do n't want anyone to see you diving on the wreck . You 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a bloody celebrity ! If people knew you were diving on that wreck , they 'd right away spot something was up . " Coffin leaned back in his chair , mollified by the flattery . " There 's sense in what you 're saying . Would n't want to give anything away . " He eyed his empty glass . " I say let 's fl drink on it . " " No , " Treece said , standing up . " I 've got work to do . " Coffin followed Treece and the Sanderses down the path to the road . Treece opened the door of the Hillman and ? like an octopus insinuating itself tentacle by tentacle into a crevice in a reef  --  slowly fit one long limb after another into the driver 's compartment . Coffin said , " Do n't breathe too deep , or you 'll blow the horn with your chest . " Treece said to Sanders , " You want to follow , or can you find your way ? " " We 'll find it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , apparently consider-1 ing his words . " You 'll stay at the hotel tonight ? " " I guess so , " she said . " Why ? " Do . And keep your door locked . I do n't want to scare you , but Cloche is sure to know you 're there . " Gail remembered the sight of the motorbikes that morning . " I know . " Treece started the car , waited for a taxicab to pass , then made a U-turn on the narrow road and chugged off toward St. David 's . After the car had disappeared from view , Coffin stared 103  | down the empty road . The Sanderses mounted their motorbikes and put on their helmets . " Good-by , Mr. Coffin , " Gail said . Coffin did not respond . " I knew him when he was a boy , " he said . " A fine lad . " Gail and David looked at each other . " I 'm sure , " she said . " He seems to be a fine man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " " Better than what ? " " Loneliness . Sadness . It 's one thing for old croaks like me . We 're supposed to be lonely . But a young fella like him  --  it ai n't right . He should have sons to pass along what he knows . " Sanders said , " Maybe he likes living alone . " Coffin looked at Sanders . His eyes were cicatrices in his bony head . " Likes it , huh ? " he said sharply . " Likes it , does he ? A lot you know . " He turned away . David and Gail watched Coffin walk up the hill into his house . Sanders said , " What did I say ? " " I do n't know . But whatever it was was n't the right thing . " Sanders looked at his watch . " Let 's go . I 've got to get all the way back to St. David 's before dark . " 104  | The moon had risen well above the horizon , casting an avenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-three feet long , a wooden craft with the name Corsair painted on the stern . Standing next to Treece at the wheel , Sanders looked aft . The hull , he guessed , had once been a standard-design fishing boat , but by now Treece had so radically altered it to fit his peculiar needs that it looked eccentric . There were winches on both sides of the cabin , racks for scuba tanks along the gunwales , and , where a fighting chair would be bolted to the deck , an air compressor . An aluminum tube , perhaps I05  | twelve feet long and four inches in diameter , was lashed to the starboard gunwale . The lamp in the binnacle threw a faint yellow glow on Treece 's face . Sanders said , " There are so many stars up there , I ca n't pick out St. David 's light . " " Only one that winks regular , " said Treece . The sea was flat calm , and the lights on shore , a mile away , were passing with mechanical smoothness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can you tell where you are ? " " Habit . Once you know the shore line , you can tell by the way lights are clustered . Things like Orange Grove and Coral Beach stick out . You 'll see . " " How do you avoid the reefs in the dark ? You ca n't see the rocks . " " A night like this is a bit sticky . There 's not enough breeze to raise many breakers . You pick your way through . " Treece smiled . " After you make a couple of mistakes , you recess your prop in the hull and put a pair of steel skegs along the bottom so when you hit a rock you get a noisy bong that tells you to back off . " Sanders heard a whine from the bow . He looked through the windshield and saw Charlotte crouched on the pulpit that extended out from the bow . Her haunches were quivering , and her tail twitched excitedly . " What 's her problem ? " " Phosphorescence , " said Treece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders leaned over the starboard gunwale and looked forward . A mantle of tiny yellow-white lights covered the water displaced by the bow of the boat . io6  | " It 's called bioluminescence . The boat disturbs the micro-organisms in the water , and they react by giving off light . Some of them are worms , others are crustaceans . Same as fireflies , basically . The Japs used to rub them on I their hands during the war so they could read maps in the jungle at night . Charlotte wants to eat them . " Sanders said , " She 's got quite an appetite . " " One day she 'll be lunch herself . A while back , she got all hot over a shark that was cruising about ; jumped on the bastard 's back and tried to take a bite out of him . " " Why did n't it eat her ? " Treece laughed . " The shark was bloody terrified  --  not exactly accustomed to having some hairy thing jump on him from above . Took a big shit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' round by and by , but by then I had the dumb bitch out of the water . " " Why do you bring her along ? " " She gets lonely if I leave her . " Treece swung the wheel a quarter turn to the left . " Besides , she 's company . " They fell silent , watching the glassy night water and the twinkling lights on shore . Sanders took a deep breath , exulting in the salty freshness of the air . He could not remember feeling so good , so alive . He felt as if he were living out the dreams of his youth , and , like a child , he was pleased  --  almost proud  --  to be alone with Treece . He was mildly ashamed to recognize that he was glad Gail was not with them . This was something special , an experience that would be his alone . He reprimanded himself : Do n't be a middle-aged adolescent . The best reason for not bringing Gail along is that this might be dangerous . He contemplated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ambivalent toward them : nervous but excited , afraid of the unknown but impatient to meet it , eager to do things he had never done . As he looked at the dark water , a shiver of anticipation made the hair on his arms rise . They traveled southwest for another few minutes . " See up ahead , " Treece said , pointing . " That 's Orange Grove . You can tell by the lights : four in a row close together , that 's the dining room . Then a dark spot for the kitchen , then a long thin one  --  the picture window in the bar . " " What do you do on a foggy night ? " " Stay home . " Treece kept the boat at three-quarters throttle until they were directly off the Orange Grove lights . Then he turned toward shore and slowed to a speed just above idle . He peered through the cabin window at the water ahead . " Could use a bit of wind , " he said , " and a bit of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stick out like the cherry on a cream pie . " " How much do you draw ? " " Three feet . We should get through with nothing more than a scratch or two . " " Will I be in your way if I go up forward ? " " No . Sing out if you see anything that wants to dent us . Sanders walked to the bow . The dog was still blocking the way to the pulpit , and Sanders nudged her aside and went to the end of the pulpit . The bow cut through the water with a sshhhh noise that , from where Sanders stood , was as audible as the low chug of the engine . Sanders looked at the streak of moonlight ahead . Something broke water  --  a flash of silver crossed the moonlight and splashed into the dark . Sanders looked back at Treece , who said , " Barracuda. "  | They crossed the first line of rocks , and the second . Twenty or thirty yards in front of the boat , Sanders saw rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unseen hand had thrown a stone from above . " What 's that ? " he said . Treece raised up on tiptoes . " Bejesus ! " he said , and he swung the wheel hard left . " That bastard would 've stove us clean . " " Reef ? " " Aye . We 're in the third line now . " Treece aimed the bow toward shore and turned off the engine . The boat continued to drift , then finally settled , nearly motionless . Treece jumped up onto the gunwale and walked forward . " No wind , no tide , no nothing . One hook should keep us here . " He threw an anchor overboard and let the line run through his hands until it fell slack . He tugged it twice , securing the anchor in the coral , and tied it to a forward cleat . " Let 's get dressed . " Followed by the dog , they went aft into the cockpit . As Sanders attached his regulator to the neck of the scuba tank  --  holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't putting it on backward  --  Treece went below . He threw two black neoprene wet suits  --  boots , trousers , jackets , hoods  --  through the hatch onto the deck . " Is the water that cold ? " Sanders asked . " No , but the rocks 'll flay you at night . Brush up against something you ca n't see , it 'll give you the chills . " Treece  | ducked below again , and returned , carrying in one hand a metal strongbox , in the other a large battery-powered light in an underwater housing . He showed Sanders the on-off switch on the light and said , " We wo n't use it any more than we have to . It 's a bloody beacon down there . " " How will we see ? " " I 'll see , " Treece said , pointing to the strongbox . " You stick next to me . " He opened the box . Inside , cushioned with rubber , were a mask and a pistol-grip flashlight . " Infrared stuff . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dressed , they sat on the starboard gunwale . " Look at your watch , " Treece said . " After half an hour , you come up , no matter how much air you 've got left . Do n't want to run out of breeze at night . There may be a current down there , and it 's no fun to swim five hundred yards back sucking a dry tank . " Treece reached beneath the gunwale , found a Ping-Pong paddle , and tucked it in his weight belt . The dog wagged her tail and sniffed at Treece 's flippers . " Guard the boat , Charlotte , " he said . He looked at Sanders . " Set ? We 'll go down together . When we hit bottom , turn on the light and have a quick look-around . Make it as short as possible . Soon as you see something familiar , so you know where we are , turn off the light and head for it . If I 'm lucky with this " ? he held up the infrared light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . " " What makes you think anybody 'll come out after us ? " " Chances are , nobody will . But there 's no sense issuing engraved invitations . " Treece put in his mouthpiece and made a thumbs-up IIO  | sign . Sanders answered with the same sign , and they rolled backward into the water . Beneath the surface was utter darkness . More than an absence of light  --  it was a thick , enveloping black , a positive nothingness . Sanders ' eyes were open , but they did not see  --  not his bubbles as he breathed , nor the rim around the faceplate of his mask , nor a finger held an inch in front of his face . For a second , he believed he had suddenly been struck blind . Water washed around his nose . He tilted his head to clear his mask , feeling for the top of the faceplate , pressing hard with his fingers , exhaling through his nose , and he saw undulating pinpoints of light  --  starlight refracted by the water . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink toward the bottom . He took a breath , and his descent slowed . The water , chilly at first , was warming to body temperature inside his wet suit . He felt warm and helpless and peaceful , as if he were revisiting the womb . He spread his arms and let himself glide softly to the bottom . His flippers touched sand . There was a gentle current , enough to make standing difficult , so he dropped to his knees . The light hung around his wrist by a rubber thong . He felt for the on-off switch and pushed it with his thumb . A cylinder of yellow stabbed through the black . Sanders had no idea where he was or which way he was facing . He swung the light left and right over the sand and rocks and was startled by the brilliance of the colors brought out by the incandescent beam . By day , the sand had looked pale blue-gray , the rocks blue-brown , the fish blue-green . But the flashlight brought out the natural  | colors . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power-pink belly of a slumbering parrot fish . The light hit a line of brown , covered by green , and Sanders recognized it as one of the timbers from the wreck . The head of a small barracuda appeared at the edge of the beam of light . It lingered for only a moment . Sanders looked around . Outside the narrow shaft of yellow , all was black . He wondered if sharks were attracted by light . Something touched his shoulder . He jerked backward in spasmodic shock and felt fingers tapping him . Then he saw the black figure of Treece move into the beam of light . Treece gestured for Sanders to turn off the light and follow him ; he held out his hand . Sanders took the hand , turned off the light , and when he felt a slight tug , began to kick alongside Treece . Still he saw only black . Without Treece 's special mask , the infrared light was invisible . Sanders assumed that Treece was homing in on the cave , for there was no hesitation to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a relatively straight line . Treece slowed , then stopped . With his hand , he guided Sanders to a spot on the bottom . He tapped the light , and Sanders pressed the switch . They were at the mouth of the cave . The light reflected off the white sand and rock walls . Sanders saw the rock marker they had placed in the cave . Treece 's hand moved it and set it in the sand next to the infrared light . A finger pointed to the depression in the sand where the rock had been , telling Sanders to train the light II2  | there . The finger withdrew , and a hand appeared , holding the Ping-Pong paddle . Treece moved the paddle over the sand in short , swift motions . The sand rose in billows : in seconds , the cave was filled with a cloud . Sanders put his face down beside the light . The hole in the sand grew . It was several inches deep , more than a foot in diameter . Treece brought his face down beside Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the paddle waved the sand away . Treece stopped fanning . At first , Sanders thought he had given up . Then he saw two fingers reach into the sand hole and withdraw , clutching what looked to Sanders like a brown leaf . There was a faint impression on the leaf , traces of writing or printing . The fanning resumed , and Sanders saw a glint in the sand . The fingers probed again , as delicately as if they were extracting a splinter from a child 's foot . An ampule was pulled from the sand . Soon more leaf appeared  --  rotten wood , Sanders now assumed , from the cigar boxes that held the ampules ; and then another ampule . Then two ampules together . Then , as the hole deepened , the corner of a box , faded and flaking . Sanders backed off a few inches , for most of the box seemed to lie outside the cave . Treece fanned until he had uncovered the box . It lay upside down , a brown square about six inches by eight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , which came away in one mushy piece . Inside , protected by a honeycomb of cardboard partitions , lay forty-eight ampules , all intact . Treece did n't touch them . He picked up the paddle and began to fan again , moving away from the mouth of the 113  | cave . The sand that swirled around the cave was already sifting between the ampules , covering them . Treece fanned until he found the edge of another box , then stopped . He held his left wrist up to the light and rolled back his wetsuit cuff . Sanders saw the dial of his wrist watch : they had been down for thirty-two minutes . Treece 's thumb pointed up , and his hand reached to take the light from Sanders . Sanders rose slowly in the black water , watching the beam of light below him . It would move a few feet , then stop , then move again . Sanders swam without using his arms , kicking smoothly , making as little commotion as possible , for he suddenly felt lonely and vulnerable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to attract the attention of anything equipped to prey upon the weak or solitary . His head broke the surface . He looked around and saw that he had misjudged his ascent ; he had risen away from the boat , not toward it . It rested at anchor , a black sculpture in the moonlight , about fifty yards away . He did not want to swim on the surface , where he would make sounds and vibrations that an animal below might determine were being emitted by a wounded fish . So he ducked underwater and kicked in the general direction of the boat . Twice he poked his head out of water , twice discovered that he had strayed way wide of the boat . Since he could see nothing on the bottom against which to measure his progress , he could not maintain a steady course . He was breathing too fast , too deeply , his lungs gasping for more air than the regulator would give them . Stop it ! " 4  | he told himself . Stop it , or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay motionless in the water , forcing himself to breathe more slowly . Gradually , the ache in his lungs subsided . He raised his face from the water , saw the boat , and , with a smooth , deliberate breast stroke , swam toward it . Sanders reached the boat and held onto the diving platform at the stern that made it possible for divers to board the boat without assistance . He unsnapped his shoulder harness and heaved his tank onto the platform . Then he hauled himself up and sat , breathing heavily , letting his flippered feet dangle in the water . He heard a distant whining from the direction of the bow . Treece 's head popped up beside the platform . He spat out his mouthpiece and said , " Where 's Charlotte ? " " Forward . Sounds like she 's having a nightmare . " " Not bloody likely . " Treece pulled himself , tank and all , onto the platform . With one motion , he shed his tank and stepped over the transom onto the deck . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , so she can lick the salt off my face . " He started forward , and Sanders followed . As they neared the bow , the whining grew louder , more frantic . Sanders saw the outline of Treece ahead of him , a wide , towering figure that moved with certainty and grace even in the dark . He saw Treece stop , then heard him cry , " Bastards ! " " What is it ? " As he drew even with Treece , Sanders saw the dog . She had thrust herself against the port gunwale , where she thrashed in a contorted ball , wildly biting at her flanks . II5  | Something shiny protruded from her rear end , just above the tail , where the dog could n't reach with her teeth . She had tried to get at whatever it was , and in gnashing at her flanks had torn tufts of hair and flesh from her haunches . Exhausted , whining , she continued to snap at herself . Treece squatted down and put out a hand to soothe the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right , " Treece said softly . " It 's all right . " He grabbed the dog 's neck and forced her head to the deck . With his other hand , he reached around and yanked a piece of steel from the dog 's back . Freed from pain , the dog moaned and licked herself . " What happened ? " Treece strode aft , swung down into the cockpit , and snapped on an overhead light . In his hand was a two-inchlong dart shaped like a feather . " What the Christ do they think they 're doing ? " Sanders looked at the dart and said , " Cloche . " " What ? " " Cloche wears a feather exactly like that , only smaller . It must be his calling card . He 's already worked on Gail and me . Now he probably wants to force you to deal with him . " " Idiot , " Treece said . " Just because he hired some toady to row out here and shoot my dog ? That 's supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat on the deck . " All that does is piss me off . " He looked up and saw the dog hobbling along the gunwale . " Get me the first-aid kit , " he said , pointing to a locker on the starboard side . " Got to patch up the old lady . " 116  | He lifted the dog off the gunwale and set her on the deck . Gently , he forced her to lie on her good side . Treece clipped the matted hairs from around the ragged wound , cleaned it with an antiseptic , and poured sulfa powder onto it . As he worked , he cooed lovingly to the dog , soothing , reassuring , treating her , it seemed to Sanders , with paternal tenderness and affection . The dog responded : she made no sound and did not move . When he had finished , Treece scratched the dog 's ears and said , " I suppose I better bandage you . " He reached for a gauze pad and adhesive tape . " Knowing you , you 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself right up to the bloody neck . " He helped the dog to her feet , and , tail wagging feebly , she tottered to a corner and lay down . " What do you think they 'll do now ? " Sanders asked . " Cloche ? No telling . I covered up those ampules , so he 'll not be dead sure we found anything . But that just buys us a day or two . " Treece shook his head . " Lord , but there 's a Christ load of stuff down there . " " More than we saw ? " " Aye . That box was just the tip . It looks to me like the number three hold hit the rocks and spilled a little bit . Then maybe she slid backward and busted her guts . " Treece made an upside-down V with his hands . " What we saw was up at the top here . The farther down away from the cave I looked , the wider the pattern was , with some of those explosives mixed in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not with a Ping-Pong paddle . We 'll need the air lift . " 117  | He pointed to the aluminum tube lashed to the gunwale . " And we 'll have to dive with Desco gear , not air tanks . Ca n't be coming up every hour for new tanks . That means firing up the compressor , and that means noise . It 's going to be bad . " " Why ? " " The deep stuff must be all mixed in with the artillery shells . " " They 're not armed , are they ? " " Does n't matter . Brass corrodes . Primers may be weak . And the cordite in those shells is still good as new . Bang ' em together , or drop one on a rock  --  let alone use a torch ? and we 'll be playing harp duets for Saint Peter . " " Can we get the government to help ? " " The Bermuda Government ? " Treece laughed . " Aye . They 'll have the royal scroll-maker draw up a fancy scroll commissioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't for one thing , I 'd be tempted to put a charge down there and blow the whole mess to dust . " Treece fished inside his wet-suit jacket , found what he was looking for , and handed it to Sanders . It was a coin , irregular-shaped and green with tarnish . It looked as if the design on the coin had been impressed off-center , for only about three quarters of the surface of the metal carried any marks at all . Around the rim of the coin Sanders could make out the letters " EI , " then a period , then the letter " G , " another period and the numerals " 17o . " Closer to the center of the coin was an " M , " and in the center was an intricate crest that included two castles , a lion , and a number of bars . I18  | " So ? " Sanders said . " You said yourself that one coin does n't make a treasure . " " True . But that coin might . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went along the reef a way and fanned a few pockets around the rocks . I found that coin about six inches under the sand . It was lying up against a piece of iron , which is why it survived and was n't all oxidized like the one you found . " " Why is it green ? " " That 's nothing , it cleans right off . The iron it was lying up against looked to me like the hasp of a padlock . It did n't come loose right away , and I did n't want to spend the time wrestling with it . " " You mean there 's a chest down there ? " " Not the way you 'd imagine . The wood would have rotted away long since . The coins 'd be all clotted together , and a lot of them would be no damn good . There 's a clump of them down there , under a rock . I tried to pry one loose , but it would n't come . I figure it 's stuck to some others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold , I mean . " " It 's beginning to look like it . " Treece held the coin to the light . " Here . The M ' means it was minted in Mexico City . What does that tell you ? " " That the ship was going east , back to Spain . " " Aye . It was leaving the New World . About a third of the ships that wrecked were on their way to the New World , and they did n't carry treasure . They were burdened with wine and cheese and clothing and mining equipment . The numbers are the first three numbers of the II9  | date the coin was minted  --  sometime in the first ten years of the eighteenth century . That jibes with the crest . It 's Philip the Fifth 's . He took the throne in 1700 . " " What do the letters mean ? " " By the grace of God , ' " Treece said . " They 're the end of the legend on the obverse of all the coins : Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Treece turned the coin over . " That 's a Jerusalem cross . I ca n't read the letters , except for that M ' there , and the but it said Hispaniaruna et Indianan Rex  --  King of Spain and the Indies . " " So ? " " In 1715 a big fleet , one of Philip 's biggest , went down on the way home . " " I 've heard of that fleet . But somebody found it , did n't they ? " " Aye , a diver named Kip Wagner . Ten ships went down , carrying God knows how much in gold and silver , and in the early 196os Wagner found what he figured was eight of them . He pulled up something like eight million dollars ' worth of gold . " Sanders felt excitement surge through his stomach . " And this stuff is from one of the other two ships ? " Treece smiled and shook his head . " Not a chance . Something 's down there , for sure , but it ca n't be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every one of them . It 's been documented over and over again  --  survivors , eyewitness reports , logs , salvors ' records , everything  --  and no ship 's going to move a thousand miles on the bottom of the ocean . No , what we know 's no problem ; it 's what we do n't know that 's bothersome . " I20  | " Like ? " " It 's a healthy bet that if there is a ship beneath Goliath , it sank between 1710 and 1720 . If it was later than that , the coins we 've found would have later dates . New World coins did n't stay long in the New World . The Spaniards needed every one of them to keep their country afloat . But there 's no record of a Spanish ship sinking on this end of Bermuda between 1710 and 1720 . " " It does n't have to be a Spanish ship , does it , just because it carried Spanish coins ? " " No . Pieces of eight were international currency . Everybody used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking off this stretch of beach in the early 1700s . " Sanders said , " That could be good , could n't it ? It means the ship was never salvaged . " " Good and bad . It means we have to start from scratch . II ! Odds are , she went down at night . If there were survivors ? and I doubt there were  --  they 'd have no misty notion of where they pranged up . They 'd be too concerned with Ili saving their own pelts . So whatever cargo went down with her is probably still there . " " And that could be ? " " No telling . According to the records , between 1520 and 1800 the Spaniards hauled about twelve billion dollars ' worth of goodies out of the New World  --  that 's twelve billion dollars ' worth in those days . About five per cent of that was lost , and about half of what was lost was recovered , which leaves roughly three hundred million dollars on the bottom . Figure a couple of hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billion dollars . I2I  | That would be nice and neat  --  if it were true . The trouble is , everybody was corrupt , and for every dollar 's worth of registered treasure on a ship , there was probably another dollar smuggled aboard . " " To avoid taxes ? " " A special tax . By law , the King of Spain got twenty per cent of every treasure , no matter who collected it . A businessman who traded European goods for New World gold still had to pony up the so-called King 's Quinto . It was much cheaper to bribe some fellow to overlook a few things than it was to give twenty per cent to the crown . " " That explains the anchor caper , " Sanders said . " I ran across something at the Geographic about a captain who had his anchor cast in gold and painted black . " " Aye . He was hanged . The point is , there 's no way to tell what could be on a ship . There 've been a dozen cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was salvaged toting up to more than was listed for the whole ship . The lead ship of a fleet , the capitana , might have had three million dollars in registered treasure on her . But this is no capitana : there 's no fleet to go with her . It 's possible that this ship was taking home some of the survivors of the i 715 fleet . And maybe some of the salvaged treasure . But then there 'd be some record  --  if not here , then in Cadiz or Seville  --  of the survivors leaving Havana and ending up here . There 's nothing . " Treece reached inside his wet suit and pulled out an oval of gold . " Here 's another bit to the mystery . " " A coin ? " " No . " Treece passed it to Sanders . " A medallion . " 122  | There was a raised head of a woman on the medallion , and the letters " S.C.O.P.N. " " I think it 's Santa Clara , " Treece said . " The stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Look on the back . " Sanders flipped the medallion . The back was clear , except for the letters " E.F . " " Those same initials ! " " Aye . This morning I was n't able to find any officer or noble or captain with those initials , and I 've looked through mounds of papers . " Sanders returned the medallion to Treece . " Maybe it was a present for somebody . " " Not bloody likely . Nobody gave stuff like this away . " Treece dropped the medallion and the coin into his wet suit , turned off the overhead light , and started the engine . He sent Sanders forward to raise the anchor , and when he heard the clank of iron on the deck , he swung the wheel hard left and headed seaward . Sanders returned to the cockpit and said , " What do we do now ? " " We stay away from this place for a couple of days while I try to figure out what the hell 's underneath Goliath . " " Cloche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows I 'm interested , he 's bound to raise a ruckus before long . Best thing for you two might be to pack up and go home . Take the risk he 'll leave you be . " Sanders did n't reply ; Treece was probably right . Maybe he should try to take Gail home on the first plane out in the morning . But if he left , it would mean he had been 123  | lying to himself all his life . His dreams and ambitions  --  of working with Cousteau , of journeying around the world for the Geographic  --  would be stamped as the idle fancies of an armchair buccaneer . Here was a chance to do something he had never done before , a chance to live on the edge rather than slip through existence as an observer . The risks involved were genuine , not gratuitous or self-imposed , and that made them seem somehow more worthwhile . He looked at Treece , then at the deck , trying to phrase a question . Finally , he said , " What if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have a royal rumpus getting it up , around those explosives . " " No . . . I mean , what if we do get it up ? " " Why , then . . . " Treece stopped . He grinned at Sanders . " I see the wheels a-whirrin ' in the brain . Okay . I 'm tempted to lie to you , to convince you to leave , but that 's not my way . I figure , if a man wants to put his ass on the line , it 's not my place to stop him . So here it is : We go to the Receiver of Wrecks and apply for a license . " " You need a license ? " " Aye , to dive on any wreck . The license is good for a year . We could say we 're working Goliath , which is an open wreck , and not bother with a license . But I 'll apply , to keep things tidy . They 've never turned me down yet . The license 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat counts as a person . " " What 's that mean ? " " The boat counts as a shareholder , to take care of wear  | and tear and depreciation and expense . All that . But we wo n't worry about that this time . We 'll make some arrangement for expenses . So you and your wife will split half , or however you settle it with her . Whatever we find belongs to Bermuda , technically , but unless they think we 're brigands , they 'll be reasonable . The stuff the Bermuda Historical Wrecks Authority wants , it 'll make us an offer on . If there 's something they 're really hot to get , we 'll have to accept their offer , which is figured out by an arbitrator appointed by  --  who bloody else ? ? the government . Whatever they do n't want to pay for they 'll return to us , and we can do as we damn please with it . " " Sell it ? " " Perhaps . " Treece pause . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's where we may come to blows . " Sanders was startled . " About selling it ? " " Aye . We 've our differences . I do n't need money ; I imagine you do . I care about preserving finds intact . You do n't know enough about wrecks to care . " The remark stung . " I 'll learn . " " Maybe . " Treece smiled . " Anyway , the way the market is , we probably could n't sell it . Buggers . " " Who ? " " Back in the late fifties and early sixties , people found a lot of goodies . That 's when I found my first , and Wagner found the eight 17 15 ships . Everybody wanted Spanish gold , so a few sonsofbitches got cute and started dummying it . It 's easy to do and hard to detect . You ca n't carbondate  | gold , and with the technology what it is , a crook can make a right-perfect Spanish coin . " " Ca n't you spot a phony ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , I got a call from the Forrester Museum . A Professor Peabody wanted me to come look at some stuff . He did n't tell me why , but I figured he smelled a rat or he would n't be paying me to go all the way to Delaware . I looked at the coins , and I was goddamned if I could find anything wrong . But I knew there had to be something . I sat in a room staring at the bloody things for a week . They were perfect ! I started talking to myself , arguing with myself about every mark on every coin . I argued right into the answer . The coins all carried a P. ' It was the mint mark , meaning that they were minted at the Potosi mint in Peru . It 's Bolivia now . Then I looked at the date on one of the coins : 1627 . There it was . " " There what was ? " " The Potosi mint did n't put out any gold coins until the late 165os . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent thousands of dollars buying gold in Europe and having coins made . " " What for ? " " Some folks do it for the premium on authentic Spanish gold . You used to be able to get five thousand dollars for a good royal doubloon . I have a bar with only forty-eight ounces of gold on it  --  even at two hundred an ounce that 's less than ten thousand  --  and I 've been offered forty thousand for it . But this lad had a grander scheme . He dummied the coins to convince people he had found a wreck he 'd been looking for : the San Diego , went down in the 1580s. 126  | He did convince a few , too , and suckered them into investing money in his corporation . He called it Doubloons , Inc . I believe they got him on some fraud charge . " " Did his coins get into circulation ? " " That 's the bitch of it . Nobody can be sure . But even if his did n't , someone else will come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell a coin or a gold bar these days unless you 've got papers on it from the Smithsonian and every Christ agency in the world . I 've seen coins up for auction that could n't have cost more than fifteen dollars . Made in the Philippines . Squeeze ' em too hard , you 'll rub the date off . It 's gotten so bad that some blokes  --  upright , honest chaps who 've got the real thing  --  are being forced to sell Spanish coins to dentists , who melt them down for fillings . Coins three and four hundred years old , rich with the stink of history . And they 're goin ' into a hole in some old lady 's mouth . " " What can we do with what we find ? " Treece laughed . " If , " he said . " God knows . One good thing , though : It does look like there 's more than coins on this one . Jewelry , too , at least some . There has n't been too much faking of jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and held it in the dim light from the binnacle . " The Indians used to say , Gold is the god of the Spaniards . ' It buggered up the Indians , buggered up the Spaniards , and it looks like it 's going to keep buggering up people till the end of time . " It was after eleven when Treece throttled back and turned Corsair into the cove beneath St. David 's light . By the glow of the descending moon , Sanders could see that I27  | the rickety pier was deserted . Treece 's two other boats , a dory and a Boston Whaler , hung limply at their moorings . They made fast Corsair 's lines , put their diving gear away , and walked to the end of the pier . The first few yards of the dirt path leading up the hill were visible in the moonlight . Then the path turned left and vanished in the dark underbrush . " This 'd be a hell of a place to jump somebody , " Sanders said , walking with his arms before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone fool enough to try , " said Treece . Sanders felt a pang of irritation at Treece 's manifest faith in his invulnerability . " What are you , bulletproof ? " " I do n't imagine . But there 's bush about me . A lot of people believe that anyone who mucks with me will be a goner within the day . It 's a nice myth to foster . " They reached the top of the hill and walked to the picket fence surrounding Treece 's house . The dog , feeling spry again , had already vaulted the fence and was sniffing at something on the front doorstep . " Tomorrow ? " said Sanders . " I 'll be looking through papers all day . " " Should we call you at Kevin 's ? " " If you want . Or come out , if you 're curious to see how thrilling it is to root around in dusty papers looking for a set of initials . " Treece opened the gate and stepped into the yard . " Either way , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders removed the padlock from the front wheel of his motorbike . Like all mobilettes rented to tourists , his had I28  | no automatic starter , no gears , and a maximum level speed of 20 mph . He sat on the seat , opened the throttle halfway , and pushed on the pedals . The bike moved slowly ; the engine chugged twice and caught . He heard Treece call , " Hey ! " He throttled down and pedaled the bike in a tight circle back to the gate . " Have a look at this . " Treece held something in his hand . It was a Coke bottle , with a white feather inserted in the neck . " What is it ? " " Bush . To scare me , I guess  --  though I do n't know how they expect voodoo to work on a Mahican Indian brainwashed in Scotch Presbyterian schools . " Treece gazed out over the dense underbrush surrounding the yard . " But I 'll give ' em this : They 've got balls , just to come around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , angrily , he pegged it high in the air . The bottle spun , catching rays of light and breaking them into shimmering green and yellow fragments , and fell out of sight behind the cliff . The headlight on Sanders ' motorbike was weak , barely adequate to illuminate the potholes on St. David 's Road . He traveled slowly , sensing the road rather than seeing it . At the bottom of a short hill , the road bent sharply to the right . Sanders braked on the way down the hill , and by the time he reached the bottom the motorbike was moving so slowly that it wobbled . The road rose again immediately . He opened the throttle and pedaled with his legs , but he could not generate enough momentum . The bike tipped . I29  | Sanders dismounted and began to push the bike up the hill , helping himself with short bursts from the hand throttle . When at last the road leveled out , Sanders stopped to catch his breath . He sat on the seat and hung his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black shadow standing just beyond the reach of his light . A voice said , " Have you thought about our offer ? " Sanders did n't know what to say . He looked around , and heard only cicadas , saw only darkness . " We . . . we did n't find anything . " The voice repeated . " Have you thought about our offer ? " " Yes . " " And have you come to a decision ? " The accent was lilting , Jamaican . Not Cloche . " Well . . . " Sanders stalled . " Not ... " " Yes or no ? " " Not exactly . There has n't been much time . I . . . " " We 'll see , then . " The shadow moved back into the underbrush . There was a rustle of foliage , and the road was empty . We 'll see , my eye , Sanders thought . If they want to do something to me , why did n't they do it then ? Then a shock went through him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road . The first time , rounding a corner , unable to see more than ten yards ahead , he banked the motorbike too sharply . The rear wheel hit some gravel and skidded , and Sanders landed on the road on an elbow and knee , shredding the skin . He fell a second time right before the turnoff for Orange Grove . He had the throttle wide open and was moving fast , with too little light to give him notice of a sudden left turn in the road . He went straight , plowing into the bushes . Thorns and branches lashed his face and tore at his clothing . As he righted the motorbike and pushed it back onto the road , he felt frantic , iii  | almost hysterical . He gunned the engine , and the bike lurched off down the road . He tried to calm himself , arguing that if anything had happened to Gail , he was too late to stop it  --  nearly an hour had passed since his talk with the man on the road . But what if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone ? He turned into the Orange Grove driveway and , through the bushes , saw that there were lights on in his cottage . He dropped the bike , and as he raced for the door , he could see through a window someone in the bedroom . He stopped , feeling the thump of pulse in his temples . The curtains were half-drawn , but Sanders recognized Gail ? sitting on the end of the double bed , her hair a mess , her nightgown askew . She was staring , as if hypnotized , at something on the floor . He threw the door open and saw her recoil , terrified , her arms clutching her breasts . At her feet was a shoe box full of tissue paper . When she saw Sanders , she let out a gasp and began to sob . For a moment , he looked at her , stunned . Then he shut the door and went to her . He sat on the bed and put his arms around her . She trembled , and the sobs made her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed unhurt ; there were no marks on her . Nevertheless , he assumed she had been raped , and when he closed his eyes , he conjured a scene of three or four black men  --  he thought particularly of the young man with the scar on his chest , Slake  --  holding her down while , one at a time , they assaulted her . The thought nauseated him , he felt dizzy . He wondered what he would feel the 132  | next time they tried to make love . Then anger replaced nausea , and he tried to think how , where , he could get a gun . " Take it easy . It 's okay . Tell me what happened . " She nodded . " I 'm probably . . . " she said , trying to control the convulsive sobs , " . . . silly . It was n't . . . that bad . " " What did they do ? " She looked at him and realized what he was thinking . She smiled weakly . " They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously he sensed regret at losing the supreme cause for revenge . He still wanted to kill them . " What was it , then ? " " What time is it ? " she asked . " Twelve-fifteen . " " At eleven I went to bed . I locked the door and put the chain on it . I must have gone right to sleep . I do n't know how long I was asleep , but I heard a knock on the door . I thought it was you . I called your name , but a voice said : No , you 'd been hurt in a motorbike accident , said he was a policeman sent to take me to the hospital . I opened the door . There were three of them . " " Did you recognize anybody ? " " All of them . They were all at Cloche 's the other day . One used to be our waiter here , the one with the big scar . " " Slake , " Sanders said . " He was the one who pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cupped her hand over her mouth ? " and shoved me back on the bed . He said if I made a sound , he 'd cut my throat . I think he would have . " " I do , too . " 133  | " He kept his hand on my throat and asked if we were going to co-operate . I told him . . . I suppose I was a little blunt . . . " " What ? " " But I was so scared , and I was sure I was going to be raped no matter what . So I said , Go fuck yourself . ' All he did was laugh and say in that way they have , You be careful , missy , or it be you get fucked . ' Then he asked me again what we were going to do , and I said something like , you can tell Cloche we would n't do what he wants for ten million dollars . " " Maybe you should have lied . " " I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " One of them said , Let 's do her . ' Then I knew I was going to be raped . " She shuddered , and he held her shoulders tighter . " ' Do her . ' God , what a horrible word . It 's like what they used to say : Let 's waste him . ' Slake held my throat with one hand and yanked up my nightgown with the other . He held me so tight I could n't look down . All I could see was the ceiling . I felt a pair of hands pulling off my underpants . " She stopped and began to cry . In a corner , Sanders saw her pants . The fabric was wrapped around the elastic ; they had been peeled off her hips and thighs . " I thought you said they did n't . . . " She put a hand on his knee and shook her head , sniffling and swallowing . " They did n't . One of them held my legs and spread them apart . I 've never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open . It was awful . " 134  | " But they did n't hurt you ? " " No . The next thing I felt was like a finger running all over me . . . down there . . . from my belly button on down . But it was n't a finger . It was softer , kind of hairy . I still do n't know what it was . A brush , I guess . " " A brush ? " " Look . " Gail lifted her nightgown above her hips and lay back on the bed . Sanders felt panicked and had to force himself to look . He remembered a time , years before , when a doctor friend had invited him to watch an appendectomy . Sanders had worn a surgical mask , and the patient , a teen-age girl , had assumed he was the doctor . Lying there , with her privates exposed and shaven , she had begged him to make the scar as small as possible , so it would n't show above her bikini . Sanders found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , finally , when the first incision was made , repulsed . Gail noticed his discomfort , and she said , " It 's okay . Look . " There were six red smears on her groin , rough lines running crosshatched  --  from pubis to navel , hip to hip , pubis to each hip , and hip to navel . The design , such as it was , looked like a kite . " What is it ? " Sanders asked . " Paint ? " " No . I think it 's blood . " " Not yours . " " No . Animal blood of some kind . " " How do you know ? " 135  | " I tasted it . It tastes salty , like blood . " She sat up and lowered her nightgown . " Did they say anything ? " " Nothing . Neither did I. I was so scared . . . as long as they were n't hurting me , I did n't dare say anything . The whole thing took less than a minute . Then Slake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me go , but I did n't move . Then one of the others put that thing on my stomach . " She pointed to the shoe box . " He said it was a present from Cloche . " Sanders leaned over and unfolded the tissue paper in the shoe box . " Oh , Christ , " he said . " I do n't ever want to see it again . " Gail stood and walked to the bathroom . Sanders put the shoe box on his lap and removed the doll . It was crude  --  linen wrapped around straw  --  but its meaning was clear : the hair on the doll 's head was human , exactly the color of Gail 's . Her appendectomy scar was stitched to the right of the silver sequin that represented the navel . And there were six red streaks on the doll 's groin , in the same pattern the men had painted on Gail . But the streaks on the doll had been slashed with a knife , and from them tufts of red and blue cotton hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt cold ; his mouth was dry and cottony . He had never known a fear like this . Threats to himself he thought he could handle , but this was beyond his control  --  which , he was sure , was what Cloche had in mind . He heard water running in the bathroom . " It 's blood , " Gail called . " It comes off easily . " 136  | " Do you think they really would . . . " Sanders started to ask . " What ? " " Nothing . " Sanders pitched the doll across the room . He went to the telephone and , when the hotel operator answered , said , " Get me Pan American , please . " Gail came out of the bathroom . Her hair was combed , and she held a glass of whiskey in her hand . " This should help , " she said . " It 's . . . " She stopped when she saw Sanders on the phone . " Oh , for . . . " Sanders said into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " What were you doing ? " " Trying to get us the hell out of here . The airlines do n't open until nine in the morning . " " You mean home ? " " Damn right . " " But he 'll follow us . " " Let him . " " I 'm all right . " She saw that the hand holding the glass of scotch was shaking , and she smiled . " I 'll be all right . " Sanders paused . " I do n't think they 're kidding . Neither do you . " " No , I do n't . " " Then what 's the argument ? It 's not worth the risk , not even the smallest chance that somebody really would rip your guts out . Treece said it : We 're here on holiday , our honeymoon , for God 's sake . We 're not here to get murdered by a maniac . " " It 's not us you 're worried about , is it ? It 's me. " 137  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of yourself . " When he said nothing , she continued . " Do n't worry about me . We ca n't spend the rest of our lives terrified . Besides , we have to stop Cloche from getting those drugs . He 'll use them to ruin lives , to kill innocent people ; he does n't care . Well , I do . I 'm going to do what I should have done all along : go to the government . I have to . " " What do you mean ? Treece told you : It wo n't do any good . " " Maybe not , but I ca n't walk away from it . " Her hand still trembled , but there was a look of fierce intensity on her face . " It was n't you they threw on the bed ; it was n't your crotch they painted . I 'm staying , at least until I talk to the government . " Sanders looked away . She went to him and touched his face . He put his arms around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight ? " she asked , her head against his chest . " Ampules . Boxes of the damn things . They 're there , no question . " " Any Spanish stuff ? " " A silver coin and a gold medallion . " " What did Treece think about them ? " " He thinks there might be another ship . Underneath Goliath . " Sanders recounted his conversation with Treece , and as he spoke , the enthusiasm he had felt on the boat returned . Watching him , seeing his excitement at the prospect of a 138  | treasure , his delight in the newly learned minutiae of Spanish ships , she felt like smiling . But , out of the corner of her eye , she could see the doll . Treece looked tired ; his eyes were red , and the skin beneath them was lined and puffy . He seemed subdued . He led the Sanderses into the kitchen , where the dog lay curled by the stove , occasionally licking the bandage on her flank . On the kitchen table was a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photostats . Gail told Treece about the visit from Cloche 's men and showed him the doll . " He 's trying to spook you , " Treece said , " show you how powerful he is . Not that he 'd hesitate to kill you . But at the moment it would n't accomplish anything for him . All it 'd do is raise a storm and seal it good you would n't help him . But if he ever decides for himself that you really wo n't go along , beware . The bastard 'd cut your throat as soon as shake your hand . " " We almost left , " Sanders said . Treece nodded . " It 's not sure he 'd get at you in New York . " " Not sure ? " Sanders said . " You think he 's serious about following us to New York ? " " Would n't have to follow you . A phone call 'd suffice . He 's a vengeful bugger and well connected . But no question , you 'd be safer there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --  at least as long as he thinks we 'll help . " She turned to Sanders . " You were right . I should have lied . " 139  | " Sounds to me like you have n't made up your minds yet , " said Treece . " Before you do , you might want to hear what I found out last night , or I should say this morning . I think I know  --  now hear me ; I say I think  --  what ship is under Goliath . " " You found E.F. , " Sanders said . " No . " Treece pointed to the papers on the table . " These are just the beginning , but they 've got a couple of clues in ' cm . You remember we talked about that 1715 fleet ? " " Sure . " " This may have something to do with that fleet . Try to follow . " He picked up a piece of paper . " The 1715 fleet was commanded by a general named Don Juan Esteban de Ubilla . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were delays , as there always were . Ships were late coming from the Far East , the Manila galleons that carried K'ang Hsi porcelain , ivory , jade , silk , spices , all manner of stuff . He waited in Vera Cruz for over a year for the cargo to arrive , be lugged across the jungle , and loaded onto his ships . He set off for Havana , where all fleets gathered for last-minute preparations . There were more delays in Havana : ships had to be repaired , more cargo loaded , manifests made up . The early spring of 1715 slipped by , then late spring , then early summer . Pretty soon , it was the middle of July . Ubilla must have been going berserk . " " Why ? " Gail asked . " Hurricanes . There 's a West Indian jingle that goes , June , too soon ; July , stand by ; August , come they must ; September , remember ; October , all over . ' A hurricane was 140  | the worst thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships were pigs . They could n't point closer than about ninety degrees to the wind , so in a big breeze they were helpless . They were always overloaded , wormy , and rotten . They leaked all day every day . " Anyway , while Ubilla was waiting , he was approached by a fellow named Dare , master of a vessel that had once been French but now flew the Spanish flag and carried a Spanish name  --  El Gri f on . Dare wanted to join Ubilla 's fleet , and with bloody good reason : His manifest listed more than fifty thousand dollars in gold and silver , and if he sailed alone there was n't a chance he 'd get by the Straits of Florida . Jamaican pirates would get him . They had spies everywhere , and they 'd know exactly when he left Havana . But Ubilla said no . He was all hot about the delays and the weather , and he did n't want the headache of shepherding another vessel ; ten ships was plenty to keep tabs on . Dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cargo , something other than what the manifest said . Ubilla would n't budge . " " All that 's in there ? " Gail said , indicating the papers on the table . " Most of it . Everybody kept diaries in those days , and Spanish bureaucrats were fanatics about keeping detailed records , usually for self-protection . Anyway , under normal circumstances Ubilla 's word would have been law . He was responsible for the fleet , and it was up to him to say who sailed with him and who did n't . But evidently there was more to El Gri f on than Dare was willing to tell . He went over Ubilla 's head , to the highest royal representative 141  | in Havana , and in jig time Ubilla was ordered to take El Gri f on with him . So now there were eleven ships in the fleet . " Sanders broke in . " You said last night there were ten ships in the fleet , and they all sank off Florida . " " That 's what I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheet of paper . " This is Ubilla 's manifest . It lists ten ships and all their cargo . What must have happened is that Ubilla had made up his manifest , had done all his paper work , and he was impatient as hell to set sail . If he had gone by the book and presented his manifest for revision , to take into account the eleventh ship  --  one he did n't want to bother with anyway  --  the bloody bureaucrats would have kept him in Havana for another month . They insisted on listing every farthing that went with a fleet , or at least every farthing they were n't bribed to ignore  --  and that would have delayed the fleet 's departure until the middle of the hurricane season . " Gail said , " How did you find out about El Gri f on ? " Treece picked through the pile of documents and found a frayed , cracked , yellow piece of paper . He pushed it across the table to her . " Do n't bother to read it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell worth a damn . It 's a survivor 's account . About four lines from the bottom , there 's a word spelled o-n-c-e  --  the number eleven . I must have read that bastard a hundred times before , and I never picked it up . He says there were eleven ships in the fleet . " i He riffled the stack of paper . " It was easy enough to check , or double-check once I had that clue . The King 's flunky kept a meticulous diary , and he mentioned El Gri f on as I42  | leaving with Ubilla . Reading him kept me up half the night . He was a pompous bastard , and I had to wade through a pile of self-serving crap . When Ubilla got the order to take Dare with him , he apparently told Dare to join up with the fleet a few hours out , so as to avoid the bureaucrats knowing  --  they 'd have forced him to wait till he could revise his manifest . " Treece coughed , stood up , and , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fleet of ten , plus one , left Havana on Wednesday , July 24 , 1715 , " he said , sitting down . " It carried two thousand men and , officially , fourteen million dollars ' worth of treasure . The real value was likely something over thirty million . The weather stayed fine for five days . You 'd think they 'd be well out to sea by then , but those hogs only made seven knots , so they 'd barely got to Florida , somewhere between where Sebastian and Vero Beach are today . They had no way of knowing it , but ever since they 'd left Havana there had been a hurricane brewing down south , and it had been gaining on them every day . " It caught up with them on the sixth day out , a Monday night , and by two in the morning it was beating the bejesus out of them : forty- , fifty-foot seas , hundred-mile winds blowing out of the east and driving them west , toward the rocks . Ubilla gave one course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow him , but it was hopeless . Dare must have been the only one who consciously disobeyed . Maybe he did n't trust Ubilla ; maybe he was just a royal fine sailor . Either way , he kept El Grit ' on half a point farther to the northeast than the other ships , and , by Christ , he survived . " 143  | " He made it alone ? " Sanders said . " No . He went back to Havana . He was still worried about pirates . That , or his ship might have been so beat up that he did n't dare try the crossing without making repairs . And now , " Treece said with a mischievous smile , " the plot thickens . There is no record at all of what happened to Dare and El Gri f on once he got back to Havana . For all practical purposes , he disappeared . So did his ship . " " He could have tried to make it alone , " Sanders said . " Later on . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , changed his ship 's name , and joined another fleet . " " Why would he do that ? " Gail asked . " There are reasons . But a caution : What I 've been telling you is fact , close as I can get it . From here on , it 's pure speculation . " He took a drink . " We know that Dare was carrying goodies worth a hell of a lot more than his manifest said , else he never would have been foisted off on Ubilla . It 's a good bet that only a couple people knew what Dare had on board  --  Dare himself and the King 's man in Cuba . Suppose Dare went back to Havana and reported to the officials that the fleet was lost . Then suppose he went to the King 's man and made a deal . Say , in return for a portion of Dare 's goodies , whatever they were , the King 's man would report that Gri f on had gone down with the fleet . Dare would then disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could keep what was on board , because everyone thought it had all been lost . " Sanders said , " That 's an awful lot of supposes . ' " " Aye , " Treece conceded . " I told you , I do n't know anything yet . The only decent evidence we have is time . For 144  | instance , the date on the coin fits . Most of the other evidence is negative : no one ever heard of Dare or El Gri f on again ; no other ships were reported sunk around here in those years . And I ca n't find a likely candidate for ownership of the E.F . pieces , which means they were part of a secret cargo  --  or at least an unregistered one . " " But Bermuda 's only one island , " Sanders said . " Gri f on could have gone down anywhere . Florida , the Bahamas . . . " " Possible , but not probable . In the deep , maybe , but that was rare . We know Dare was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bad season again . And the Bahamas channel was abandoned long before then as too dangerous . If he went down  --  and I 'll grant you , it 's an if ' ? he went down here . " " Why would he even come here ? " " As you 'll learn if you take the trouble , " Treece said , " he had no choice . The route to the New World was southerly , down the coast of Spain , across to the Azores , then over the ocean on the easterly trades . The route home was northerly , up the coast of the States , then a turn to the east . It was mostly eyesight navigation . They did n't have proper instruments for determining longitude , so they used Bermuda as a signpost to tell them when to turn east . The weather did n't have to be too bad for them not to be able to see Bermuda until they were on it . Christ , man , there are more than three hundred wrecks on this island . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chances of getting it up ? " Gail asked . " I mean , if it is El G ri f 6n . " " Getting the ship up ? Not the faintest prayer . There 's 145  | nothing left of her . It 's getting what was on her that 's possible . " " But nobody knows what that was . " " True , but we 're a step beyond daydreams now . There is something down there . " Treece looked happy , excited . " By rights , you found her . Whatever she is , you were the first to find her . You did n't know it , and you still would n't if I had n't told you , but that does n't alter the facts . W7hat I 'm telling you is , I do n't want you to go away from here and then get all hot later on if I find something . What 's there  --  a lot or a little  --  is half yours . " Sanders was grateful , and he started to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know one thing , " she said . " I 'm going to the government about the drugs . " " Oh Christ ! " Treece smacked his hand on the table . " Do n't be stupid . The government wo n't do a goddamn thing . " Sanders was surprised at Treece 's sudden vehemence , confused as to whether Treece 's anger came from annoyance at the change of subject , the break of mood , or from genuine contempt for the government . Treece was glaring at Gail , and Sanders wished he knew how to help her . But she seemed to need no help . She looked back at Treece and said evenly , " Mr. Treece , I 'm sorry if I annoy you . But we 're not Bermudians ; we 're tourists , guests of your government . I do n't know what you have against them , but I do know that we  --  David and I , anyway  --  have got to tell them about the drugs . " 146  | " Girl , I can get those drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloche to get ' em any more than you do . I 've no love for that filth . I 've seen what it can do . " Gail 's expression did not change . Treece stood up . " Tell ' em , then ! Learn your own fool lesson . " Sanders felt that Treece was ordering them to leave . " What will you do ? " he said . " What I told you I 'd do , and not a damn thing more . I 'll register the Spanish ship . " " What 'll you call it ? " " Spanish ship . That 's all the bastards need to know . " They had lunch sent to their room . While they waited for the food to arrive , Gail studied the Bermuda telephone directory . The listings for the various departments and agencies of the government took up nearly a whole column . " I do n't even know what I 'm looking for , " she said . " There 's nothing like a bureau of narcotics control . " " Narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which is just where you do n't want to go . " He paused . " I ca n't figure it : What the hell do you think Treece has against the government ? " " I do n't know . But something . Maybe it 's what the bell captain said  --  St. David 's Islanders do n't think of themselves as Bermudians . " " It seems more than that . He was mad . " " What about customs ? " " What ? " " The customs department . " 147  | " Nobody 's trying to smuggle them in . " " No , but Cloche wants to smuggle them out . " She asked the hotel operator to connect her to the customs bureau . When a voice answered , she said , " I 'd like to make an appointment to speak to someone , please . " The voice said , " May I ask what this is in reference to ? " " It 's . . . " Gail chastised herself for not having a ready answer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see . Something is being smuggled ? " " Yes . Well , not exactly . Not yet . But it will be . " The voice became skeptical . " Exactly what ? And when ? " " I 'd rather not say over the telephone . Is there someone I can see ? " " May I ask who 's calling , please ? " " Yes . " Gail was about to say her name , when she remembered what Treece had said about Cloche : He has friends in many strange places . Quickly , she tried to determine whether the voice on the other end of the line belonged to a black woman . " I 'd . . . rather not say . " Now the voice was impatient . " Yes , madam . May I ask , are you a Bermuda resident ? " " No . " " Then I suggest you contact the Department of Tourism . " There was a click as the phone was hung up . " That was a big success , " Gail said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should have asked Treece who to go to . " " I do n't think he 'd have told you , " Sanders said . She called two other agencies , but because she declined ' 48  | to give specifics over the telephone , at the end of each call she was again referred to the Department of Tourism . Finally , she called the Department of Tourism and asked to speak to the director . " May I ask what this is in reference to ? " said the woman who answered the phone . " Yes . My husband and I are here on our honeymoon , and we have had an unfortunate experience . We 'd like to discuss it with the director . " " Does it have to do with money ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Money . Have you run short of funds ? " " Of course not . Why ? " " Oh . Good . I 'm sorry , but I 've been instructed to ask . We do get those calls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " One moment , please . " The woman put her on hold for a moment , then came back on the line and said , " Would four o'clock be all right ? " " Fine . " " May I have your name , please ? " " We 'll let you know when we get there . Thank you . " Gail hung up . They rode their motorbikes along South Road toward Hamilton . The rush hour had not yet begun , but , even so , the traffic leaving Hamilton was much heavier than the traffic going into town . Businessmen , dressed in knee socks , shorts , short-sleeved shirts , and neckties , sat sedately on their 125-CC. motorcycles , briefcases strapped behind them . Women , finishing the day 's shopping , carried their chil-149  | dren in wire baskets on the rear fenders of their motorbikes . Wicker baskets hung down both sides of the rear wheel , full of groceries . The Department of Tourism shared offices with the Bermuda News Bureau on the second floor of a pink building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner was moored at the Front Street dock , and the milling tourists choked the traffic to a standstill . The Sanderses parked their motorbikes between two cars on the left side of the street , locked the front wheels , and waited for a break in the traffic to let them cross the street . " I wonder . . . , " Gail said . " What ? " " I 'm ashamed to say it . But it 's true . What if this man turns out to be black ? " " I know . I thought of that , too . " " I feel like I 'm getting to be a racial paranoid . Every time I see a black face , I 'm convinced Cloche has sent someone to get me . " The receptionist was a pretty , young black woman . As they approached her desk , Gail said , " I 'm the one who called before . " She looked at a clock on the wall : it was 4:10 . " I 'm sorry we 're a little late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your name . . . now ? " said the receptionist . " Of course . Sanders . Mr. and Mrs. Sanders . " " The director is unavailable . There 's a convention of travel agents at the Princess , and he 's in meetings all day . I made an appointment for you with his assistant . " She rose 150  | and said , " Follow me , please . " She went to an office in the rear of the room and spoke through the open door . " Mr. and Mrs. Sanders . " She showed the Sanderses through the door and said , " Mr. Hall . " The man stood to shake hands . He was white , about forty , tan , and lean . " Mason Hall , " he said . " Please come in . " Sanders shut the door behind him , and he and Gail sat in chairs facing the desk . Hall smiled and said , " What 's the problem ? " His accent was East Coast American . Sanders said , " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Hall thought for a moment . " Goliath . Mid-forties , right ? British ship , I think . " They told Hall their story , eliminating both the clinical details of the assault on Gail and Treece 's suspicions about the existence of a Spanish ship . As they were finishing , Gail looked at David and said , " Treece was against our coming to the government . " " I 'm not surprised , " Hall said . " He 's had some run-ins with the government . " " What kind ? " Sanders asked . " Nothing serious . And it 's all pretty long ago . Anyway , I 'm glad you did come . Even if nothing else happens , you 've had more than your share of unpleasantness . I 'm sorry , and I know the director would want me to extend his apologies , too . " " Mr. Hall , " Sanders said , " that 's very nice . But we did n't come here for apologies . " 151  | " No , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll talk to the director this evening . I 'm sure he 'll want to confer with the Minister , when he returns . " " Where is he ? " " Jamaica . . . a regional conference . But he 'll be back in a few days . Meanwhile , we 'll check with the police and see if they know anything about this fellow Cloche . " " The police ? " Sanders said . " I told you , Cloche said he has friends in the police . I know he does . " " We 'll do it all very quietly . I 'll call you as soon as we know anything . " Hall stood up . " I do want to thank you for coming by . How long will you be here ? " " Why ? " " Because if it will make you more comfortable , I 'll be happy to have a policeman assigned to you . " " No , " Sanders said . " Thanks . We 'll be all right . " They shook hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along Front Street . The sidewalk was crowded with window shoppers from the Sea Venture , who peered at the Irish linen and Scottish cashmere and French perfume in the window of Trimingham 's , and calculated the savings on the duty-free liquor advertised in the spirit shops . " Do you think he believed us ? " Gail said . " I think so , but I think if we wait for him to do anything , we 'll die of old age . " A few doors ahead , Sanders saw the Pan American ticket office . When they were abreast of the door , he touched Gail 's arm and pointed . 152  | She stopped and looked at the foot-high blue letters " Pan Am " painted on the window . " We 're damned if we do and damned if we do n't , " she said . " I do n't know if I could live with the pressure at home ; the threat , the not knowing , always wondering : What if . . . ? " David gazed at the lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go see Treece . " " I 'll not say I told you so , ' " Treece said . " Bloody fools have to be scorched before they 'll admit there 's a fire . " Sanders said , " Did you register the Spanish ship ? " " Aye . You did n't tell the noble Mr. Hall about it , did you ? " " No . " " He was pretty . . . reserved . . . about you , " said Gail . " Reserved ? " Treece laughed . " That 's not the word for it . Paper-pushers ca n't figure me out . All they understand is bullshit and politics , which amount to the same thing . " " You think they 'll do anything ? " " Maybe , around the turn of the century . " Treece shook his head , as if to dismiss the government from his mind . " So , " he said , " now that you 've a half interest in what may turn out to be nothing , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gail said , " we do n't really have a choice . " " You 've figured your risks ? " Sanders said , " We have . " " All right . A few ground rules , then . From this moment on , you 're to do what I tell you . You can question all you want , when there 's time . But when there 's not , you jump first and ask questions later . " 153  | Gail looked at David . " Leader of the pack . " " What 's that ? " Treece said . " Nothing , really . When we were diving , David got annoyed at me for not obeying him . " " And rightly , too . We could get through without a bruise , but there 'll be times when getting through at all may depend on how quick you respond . Any time you 're tempted to buck me , know this : I 'll kick your ass out of here in a trice . I 'll not have you getting killed on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sanders said . " Fine . Now " ? Treece smiled ? " bad-ass decision number one : Go back to Orange Grove and turn in your mobilettes . Pack your gear , check out , and call a cab to bring you out here . " " What ? " " See ? You 're bucking me already . If we 're going to get into this mess , I want you where I can keep an eye on you , and where Cloche 's people ca n't . Back there , Christ knows who-all will have you in their sights . " " But . . . , " Gail protested . " This is your ? " " It may not have all the amenities of your hundreddollar-a-day bungalow , but it 'll do . And you wo n't have to worry about some tomcat planting voodoo dolls in your bed . " 154  | When the taxi had departed , leaving the Sanderses and their luggage outside Treece 's house , Gail said , " You think we 'll sleep in the kitchen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only room in the house we 've ever seen . He 's never even let us in the front door . " The screen door flew open , and the dog bounded down the path toward them . She stood inside the gate , wagging her tail and whining . Treece appeared in the doorway . " It 's okay , Charlotte . " The dog backed away a few feet and sat down . " Need any help ? " 155  | " We can manage . " Sanders opened the gate , hefted the two large suitcases , and , with Gail following him , walked along the path to the door . Gail had an air tank slung over each shoulder . " You have meat on you , " Treece told her . " Those are n't light . " He held the screen door for them and ushered them into the house . The doorway opened onto a narrow hall . The floor was bare  --  wide , polished cedar boards . An old Spanish map of Bermuda , the parchment cracked and yellow-brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map was a mahogany case with glass doors , full of antique bottles , musket balls , silver coins , and shoe buckles . " In there , " Treece said , pointing to a door at the end of the hall . " Here , give me those bottles . Are they empty or full ? " " Empty , " Gail said . " I 'll set ' em out by the compressor . " Sanders said , " You have your own compressor ? " " Sure . Ca n't dash into Hamilton every time I need a tank of breeze . " David and Gail went into the bedroom . It was small , nearly filled by a chest of drawers and an oversize double bed . The bed was at least seven feet square , and obviously handmade : cedar boards pegged together and rubbed with an oil that gave them a deep , rich shine . " This is his room , " Gail whispered . " Looks like it . What do you think that was ? " Sanders pointed to a spot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hung there until recently : a rectangle of 156  | clean white was clearly visible against the aged white of the wall . They heard Treece 's footsteps in the hall . Sanders dropped their suitcases on the bed . " We ca n't take your room , " Gail said to Treece , who stood in the doorway . " Where will you sleep ? " " In there , " Treece said , cocking his head toward the living room . " I made a couch big enough for monsters like me . " " But . . " " It 's better I sleep there . I 'm a fitful sleeper . Besides , I was told I snore like a grizzly bear . " He led them toward the kitchen . As they passed through the living room , Gail decided that a woman had lived in the house and had decorated it , though how recently she could n't tell . Most of the decor reflected Treece : gimbaled lanterns from a ship , brass shell casings , old weapons , maps , and stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a needlepoint rug and a gay , flower-pattern fabric on the couch and chairs . The paintings on the walls were mostly sea scenes . There were two empty spots , from which pictures had been removed . In the kitchen , Treece said , " I might 's well show you where things are . " He looked out the window . " It 's that time of day . " He opened a cabinet filled with liquor bottles . " Make yourself a charge if you like . I 'll have a spot of rum . " Sanders made drinks , while Treece guided Gail through the other cabinets . " Ca n't we contribute something ? " Gail said . 157  | " By and by . Food 's not much of a burden . " Treece smiled . " Feel you 've been asked to a house party ? " " Sort of . Show me what you want to have for dinner , and I 'll get to work . " " Supper 'll be along . I 'll take care of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll start tomorrow ; pick Adam up on the beach . " " Coffin ? " Sanders said . " He 's going to dive ? " " Aye . I tried to put him off , but he would n't have it . He still thinks it 's his ship , and he 's hot to stick it to Cloche . " " Is he good ? " " Good enough . He 's a pair of hands , and we 'll need all the hands we can get . We 'll have to work like bloody lightning , ' cause Cloche will get on to what we 're doing fast , and then it 'll be dicey as hell . Another thing about Adam : He has a zipper on his mouth . Once he shuts it , nobody 'll open it . He learned a lesson from that beating . " " Once we have the drugs , " Gail said , " what will you do with them ? Destroy them ? " " Aye , but not till we 've got every last ampule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we recover them , and Cloche were to find that 's what we 're doing , we 'd be finished . There 'd be no reason for him not to have us killed on the spot . Same if we started turning them over to the government lot by lot . Cloche 'd see his whole plan going up in smithereens , and he 'd kill us just to keep his options open . But if we accumulate them . . . The best way for us to stay healthy is to keep Cloche hoping , let him think we 're doing all his work for him , gathering them up and 158  | saving them  --  and when we 've got the lot he 'll try to pirate them from us . " Sanders noticed that Gail was eying him quizzically . At first he did n't know why ; then he realized that he had been smiling as Treece spoke  --  an unconscious grin that betrayed the strange excitement Sanders felt . He had felt it before : he had a particularly vivid recollection of the sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a potpourri of feelings  --  fear made his arms and fingers tingle and his neck and ears flush hot ; excitement made his breath come too fast , bringing on lightheadedness ; and anticipation ( probably at the thrill of being able to say he had actually jumped out of an airplane ) made him smile . The fact that he proceeded to sprain his ankle during the jump in no way diminished his glee , nor the fact that he had never jumped again . Gail frowned at him , and he forced himself to stop smiling . They heard a muffled thump outside the kitchen door . Treece stood and said , " That 'll be supper . " He opened the door and retrieved a newspaper-wrapped package from the stoop . " Supper ? " Gail said . " Aye . " Treece set the package on the counter and unwrapped it . Within , still wet and glistening , was a twofoot-long barracuda . " It 's a beauty , " he said . Gail looked at the fish , and remembering the barracuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace , her stomach churned . " You eat those things ? " " Why not ? " 159  | Sanders said , " I thought they were poisonous . " " You mean ciguatera ? " " I do n't know . What 's that ? " " A neurotoxin , a nasty bastard . Nobody knows much about it , except that it can make you sick as hell and , now and again , put you under . " " Barracudas have it ? " " Some , but so do about three hundred other kinds of fish . In the Bahamas they throw a silver coin in the pot when they boil a barracuda . They say if the coin turns black , the fish is poisonous . But here in civilization we have a much more scientific test . " Treece picked up the fish , held out his right arm , and measured the fish against it . " We say , If it 's longer than your arm , it 'll do you harm . ' I got a full hand on this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a comfort , " Gail said . " It 's not as stupid as it sounds . Ciguatoxin is more common in bigger fish , and the bigger the fish , the more of the stuff he 's bound to absorb . We figure that in a little brute like this one , even if he is ciguatoxic , chances are pretty good of getting away with nothing more than a bellyache . " Treece reached in a drawer and found a filleting knife and a sharpening stone . " Do n't be put off , " he said . He spat on the stone and rubbed the slim blade in tight circles in the pool of saliva . " I 've been eating beasts like that for the better part of forty years , and I 've never been stabbed yet . " With quick , sure sweeps , he began to scale the fish . The silvery scales flew from the knife blade and floated to the floor . " there did he come from ? " Sanders asked . 16o  | " The reef , I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get here ? I 've never heard of a fish that rolls itself in newspaper and deposits itself on your doorstep . " Sanders chuckled at his little joke . " Somebody brought him . They do that . A person catches a few fish , has more than he needs , he 'll drop one by " Gail said , " Is this what you mentioned before ? Looking after the keeper of the light ? " " Not really . " Treece flipped the barracuda over and scaled the other side . " We take care of our own . Kids ' mother gets sick , neighbors 'll feed ' em and look after ' em . Ever since . . . " He seemed to hesitate . " They know I do n't have time to go fishing and have to cook for myself , so they leave a little something . " With two sharp strokes , Treece severed the head and tail . He tossed the tail in the garbage . " You want the head ? " David and Gail shook their heads , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the eye by the point of Treece 's knife . " It 's not bad , if you do n't have anything else , " Treece said , flipping the head into the garbage . " But this fellow has a generous carcass . " He slit the barracuda 's belly from tail to throat and scooped out the innards . Then he turned the fish around and made a slit along its backbone . The whole side of meat came free . " You might heat me up some oil , " he said to Gail . " What kind ? " " Olive oil . It 's over there by the burner . Dump half a bottle in a pan and fire her up . " 161  | Treece sliced the two fillets in half and dropped them in the pan of hot oil , where they bubbled and spat and quickly turned from gray-white to golden . Gail made a simple salad  --  Bermuda onions and lettuce ? and asked Treece where the dressing was . " Here , " he said , handing her an unlabeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say . I do n't know what 's in it , but it goes in most everything  --  salads , cooking , your stomach . Do n't want to drink too much of it , though . Give you a fearsome head . " Gail poured an inch of the liquid in a glass and drank it . It tasted bitter , like vermouth . The sun had dropped below the horizon when they sat down to eat , and rays of pink , reflected off the clouds , streamed in the window and washed the kitchen with a warm , soft glow . Treece saw Gail toying with her fish , reluctant to eat it . " I 'll risk my mortal bones , " he said , smiling . " If he 's ciguatoxic , you 'll know it in a few seconds . One fellow was lugged off to hospital with the poisonous morsel still in his craw . " He did n't use a fork , but broke off a big piece of barracuda with his fingers and put it in his mouth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crippling cramps . " Nope , " he said . " Clean as a Sunday shirt . " The Sanderses ate the fish . It was delicious , moist and flaky with a crisp coating of fried oil . At 9:30 , Treece yawned and announced , " Time to put it away . We 'll want to be up early . Have to fuel the coin-162  | pressor on the boat and show you how the air lift works . Ever used a Desco ? " " No , " Sanders said . " Have to give you practice , then . There 's no trick to it , once you learn how to watch your air line . If it fouls on something , or kinks , you 'll think the beast from twenty thousand fathoms has grabbed you by the throat . " " We wo n't dive with tanks ? " Gail said . " We 'll take some , just in case . That 's another thing : We 'll have to fill them in the morning . That compressor out back makes a God-awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You never run out of air , unless the compressor on the boat runs out of gas . You use a tank for five hours and you 'll think you 've been kissing prickly pears . The mouthpiece begins to smart after a while . " " There 's no mouthpiece on a Desco ? " " No . It 's a full-face mask . You can talk to yourself all you like  --  sing , make a speech , give yourself a royal cussing . You can talk back and forth , too , if you read lips worth a damn . " They were in bed by ten . The wind whistled outside , swooping up from the sea and over the cliff . As Sanders leaned over to turn off the bedside light , he saw the dog standing , tentatively , in the doorway . " Hi , " Sanders said . The dog wagged her tail and leaped onto the bed . She curled up and lay between Gail and David . " Shoo her off , " said Gail . " Not me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , " Charlotte ! " and the dog 's ears 163  | stiffened . Treece appeared in the doorway . " Forgive her . That 's her rightful place . It 'll take her a day or two . " He said to the dog , " Come along , " and the dog raised her head , stretched , and went to Treece , who said , " Sleep well , " and shut the door . The first bark seemed to be part of Sanders ' dream . The second , loud and prolonged , woke him . He looked at the radium dial on his watch : It was 12 : io . A faint yellow light seeped around the edges of the closed window shade and flickered on the walls . The dog barked again . Gail stirred , and Sanders shook her awake . " What is it ? " she said . " I do n't know . " He heard Treece walking in the hall . " It might be a fire . " " What ? In here ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on his boxer shorts . " Stay here . " He walked toward the door . " If there 's trouble . . . " " If there 's trouble , what ? " Gail reached for her bathrobe . " Hide under the bed ? " Sanders opened the bedroom door and saw Treece standing at the front door , naked except for a brief bathing suit . The dog stood beside him . Though Treece filled the doorway , beyond him Sanders could see a glow of firelight and some dark forms . " What is it ? " he whispered . Treece turned at the sound . " Not sure . Nobody 's said anything . " Sanders approached Treece and stood beside him , 164.  | slightly to the side . By the gate there were two men , dressed in black and holding oil torches that sent streams of thick black smoke into the night air . " Well ? " Treece said aloud . He put his left hand on the doorjamb and shifted his weight . Sanders saw that the apparently casual change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sawed-off shotgun that stood in the corner behind the door . The two torchbearers stepped apart , and between them , walking slowly toward the gate , was Cloche . He was dressed entirely in white , against which his black skin shone like graphite . The firelight sparkled on the gold feather at his neck and on the round panes in his spectacles . Sanders heard Gail 's barefoot steps on the wooden floor and smelled her hair as she came next to him . " What do you want ? " Treece said , his tone a blend of anger and disdain . " If you 've business here , state it . Else , be on your way . I 'm in no mood for silly games in the middle of the night . " " Game ? " Cloche raised his right hand to his waist and dipped the index finger . Sanders heard a buzz . Instinctively , he ducked , and there was a thunk against the wooden door frame . A featherless arrow quivered in the wood , six inches from Treece 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow from the wood and tossed it on the ground . " A crossbow ? " he said . " Put feathers on it ; it 'll fly truer . " " Your . . . friends . . . are not very prudent , " Cloche said . " They paid a visit to the government . I told them not to . Now the police are asking about me. " 165  | " And ? " " You know what I want . I know they 're down there ? ten thousand boxes of them . " " That 's myth . " " Your friends do not think so . They seemed quite convinced when they spoke to Mason Hall . " Still looking at Cloche , Treece whispered to Sanders , " Go ' round back and make sure nobody 's there . " As Sanders padded down the hall , he heard Treece say , " You know tourists . They hear stories . . . . " The kitchen was dark , and the door and windows were closed . Sanders found the handle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers for a knife . He found a long heavy blade of carbon steel and slipped it into the waistband of his shorts . The cold metal against his thigh made him feel secure , though he knew it was a delusion : he did n't know how to fight with a knife . But he was quick and strong , and he knew the house . In the dark , against a man unfamiliar with the house , he thought he would be able to handle himself . He opened the kitchen door . There was no movement outside , no sound except the wind . He closed the door and locked it , then locked both windows . Now , he told himself , if somebody tries to get in , we 'll hear the sound of breaking glass . He went back to the front hall  --  pleased with himself  --  and stood beside Gail , his left hand resting on the hilt of the knife . " . . . a mystery to me , " Cloche was saying . " Why you should be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " 166  | " That 's not your affair ! " Treece snapped . " Yes , it is . You have as much reason as I to hate them . Look what you lost . " Sanders saw Treece glance quickly at him and Gail . Treece looked uncomfortable , eager to change the subject . " Leave it be , Cloche . All you need know is that I 'll not let you get those drugs . " " What a pity , " Cloche said . " The enemy is there and you will not fight him . Are you worried about your little kingdom on St. David 's ? I have no designs on that . " Treece said nothing . " Very well , " Cloche said at last . " With you or without you , the result will be the same . " Two men moved out of the darkness and stood behind Cloche . Each carried a crossbow , loaded and cocked and pointed at the door . Cloche took a small bag from one of the men behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents toward the door . Three linen dolls , each with a steel feather-dart in its chest , rolled in the dust . Treece did not look down . The crossbowmen fired . Sanders slammed Gail against the wall and shielded her with his body . Treece dropped onto one knee and , in the same motion , reached for the shotgun . Sanders heard the arrows buzz through the doorway and clatter against the stone fireplace . Treece fired three times , holding the trigger down and pumping the action . In the narrow hallway , the sound of the explosions was thunderous and painful . When the echo of the last explosion had died , and all 167  | that remained was a ringing in Sanders ' ears , he turned and looked at Treece . He was still on his knee , the gun cocked and ready to fire . Where Cloche and his men had stood , now there was nothing but the two torches  --  abandoned , burning scattered pools of spilled oil . " Hit anybody ? " Sanders asked . " I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Treece patted the gun . " I do n't think they expected it . " Sanders felt Gail trembling and heard her teeth chattering . " Cold ? " he said , putting an arm around her shoulders . " Cold ? Terrified ! Are n't you ? " " I do n't know , " Sanders said honestly . " I did n't have time to think about it . " Gail touched the knife in Sanders ' undershorts . " What 's that for ? " " I had it . . . just in case . " Gail said to Treece , " Will the police come ? " " The Bermuda police ? " Treece stood up . " Hardly . I told you , they do n't muck about with St. David 's . If they heard anything  --  and I do n't imagine they did  --  they 'll pay it no mind . Just the half-breeds shooting each other up . It 's the Islanders that concern me . " " Why ? " " They 'll have seen , and heard . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purpose of Cloche 's visit , to throw the fear into them . " " Fear of what ? " " Of him . They see a coal-black man , dressed all in white ? that 's what they dress ' em in when they die  --  coming up 168  | a hill in the dark of night with two torchbearers and two crossbowmen : that 's powerful bush . If he comes again , there 's nothing short of holocaust that 'll bring people out of their houses . " Sanders said , " Should we set watches ? " Treece looked at him . " Watches ? " " You know : four hours on , four hours off . . . in case he comes back . " " He wo n't be back tonight . " " How do you know ? Christ , you did n't think he 'd dare come up here in the first place ! " Sanders was surprised at the harsh sound of his own words . He was challenging Treece , which was not what he had intended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge was not what he had expected . Sanders knew he was right , but he did n't care . He wanted to expunge his words . " I did n't mean . . . " " If he comes back , " Treece said evenly , " I 'll hear him . Or Charlotte will . " " Fine . " " It 's late . There 's a lot to be done tomorrow . " Treece nodded to Gail , turned , and walked down the hall toward the living room . David and Gail went into the bedroom and closed the door . " Bite your tongue , " she said . " I know . " " Never mind . There 's no harm in letting him know we 're scared . " " It was n't that . It 's just better to be prepared . " Sanders pulled off his shorts and climbed into bed . 169  | Gail sat on the edge of the bed and hugged her bathrobe around her . " I ca n't go back to sleep . " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , wondering if the sudden , surprising flood of ardor had anything to do with the danger they had just been through . When they awoke in the morning , they heard voices in the kitchen . Sanders put on a pair of trousers and left the room . Treece was sitting at the kitchen table , cradling a cup of tea . Across from him , dressed in a stained sleeveless Tshirt , his mouth full of dark bread , was Kevin . They looked up when Sanders entered the kitchen . Kevin 's face conveyed no sign of recognition , even when Treece said , " You 've met . " " Sure , " Sanders said . " Hello . " Kevin said nothing , but Sanders thought he saw him blink in his direction . He poured himself a cup of coffee and took a seat at the table . Treece said to Kevin , " Does he have anybody who can use the equipment ? " Kevin shrugged . " Does he have an air lift ? " " Papers did n't say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You remember Basil Tupper , the jewelry-store fellow who paid you a visit ? Two crates of diving gear came in on the Eastern flight from Kennedy this morning , addressed to him . " " How do you know ? " 170  | " A friend in customs . There were bottles , regulators , suits  --  six of everything . " " Did n't the government ask questions ? " " Nothing illegal about it . He paid the duty  --  in cash . Besides , he imports so much crap for his jewelry business that most of the customs people are his chums . He could say he was starting a dive shop . " Treece cocked his head , listening , and for the first time Sanders noticed the low , muffled chugging sound of an engine , coming from somewhere outside the kitchen . " Compressor 's running out of juice . " Treece stood and said to Kevin , " Call Adam Coffin for me . Tell him to be on the beach at high noon . " Then he said to Sanders , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers , we 've just lost our practice time . You 'll have to settle for on-thejob training . " " She 's up , " Sanders said . They went outside . Kevin left , and Sanders followed Treece to a small shed behind the house . Inside the shed , a gasoline-powered air compressor was coughing and sputtering as it used up the last of its fuel . Two scuba tanks were connected by hoses to the compressor . Treece checked the gauges atop each tank . " Twenty-two hundred , " he said . " Want to top them off at twenty-five . " He stopped the compressor , filled it with gasoline from a jerry can , and restarted it . " Gon na get me an electric system one of these days . Gasoline 's a mean hazard . " " Fumes ? " " Aye . That 's why you see that hose there . " He pointed to a metal exhaust pipe that led from the compressor down I7I  | to the dirt floor and out through a hole in the wall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left it outside , just covered over by a lean-to affair . The wind swirled all around it , but I paid it no mind  --  till one day it swirled the exhaust fumes right back into the air intake . That was a memorable dive ; almost bought me a one-way ticket to the glooms . " " How did you find out ? " " Started to doze off at fifteen fathoms . I figured pretty quick that was what was happening , so I chucked the tank and let her rip for the surface . I made it , but barely . " Gail appeared at the door of the shed , a piece of toast in her hand . " Good morning , " she said . " That 's about all I 'd eat if I was you , " Treece said . " Got a hell of a lot of work to do , and you do n't want to be puking in your mask . " They left Treece 's dock a few minutes before eleven . In the cockpit of Corsair there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each hose was screwed into the compressor ; the other was attached to a full-face mask . Six scuba tanks were arranged in the racks along the gunwales . The aluminum tube lashed to the starboard gunwale had been rigged to a coil of pink rubber tubing , and it , too , was connected to the compressor . On a ledge in front of the steering wheel Treece had placed the sawed-off shotgun . The dog rode on the pulpit , swaying slightly with each swell but never stumbling . David and Gail flanked Treece at the steering console . " You really think they 'll come for us ? " Sanders said , gesturing at the shotgun . 172  | " Never know . " He looked at Gail . " Ever use a gun ? " " No . " " Adam 'll take the first shift aboard , then . It 's better , anyway . He knows how to turn off the compressor , and he wo n't have any second thoughts . " " Turn it off ? " " Aye . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking topside . We 'll get the message pretty quick when we start sucking nothing . Long as you do n't hold your breath on the way up , there 's no problem . Of course , " Treece smiled , " if things are really hopping up here , we might be better off staying down there breathing sand . " Treece throttled back and began to pick his way through the reefs . The offshore breeze was strong enough to cause foam to roil around the rocks , so he had no trouble finding the slim passages between the reefs . As they neared the Orange Grove beach , they could see Coffin standing in the wave wash , a rawhide figure in torn denim shorts . There were no swimmers in the water , so , once inside the reefs , Treece opened the throttle and sped toward shore . When the boat was within ten yards of the line of gentle surf , he shifted into neutral , and the boat glided to a stop . Coffin ducked under a wave and swam to the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one heave , brought Coffin into the cockpit . " I 'm glad you dressed formal for your trip to Orange Grove , " Treece said . Coffin spat sea water over the side and wiped his nose . " Buggers . Told me not to use their elevator ; told me it 173  | was private property . I told ' em to call my solicitor . " He laughed . " Rode down with the nicest piece of flesh I 've seen in years . I fell deeply in love ; almost got engaged . " Treece swung the boat seaward . On the way to the reef , he briefed Coffin about Cloche 's threat and about the diving gear that had cleared customs that morning . When he told Coffin that he wanted him to stay aboard , Coffin protested , but Treece convinced him , praising his supposed skills with firearms and his rapport with complex machinery . They anchored behind the second line of reef . " Once we get everything fired up , " Treece said to the Sanderses , " we 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stay on my left . You ever see an air lift work ? " " No . " " There 's a tube alongside it that forces compressed air up through it . Creates a kind of vacuum and sucks up the sand . It can buck like a bastard , so stay clear , and do n't get your hands too close to the mouth or it could drag your fingers up inside and cut the crap out of them . It 'll clean sand off the bottom faster'n you can believe . When we uncover ampules , you pick thern out as quick as you see them . I 'll have to be bloody careful not to let ' em get sucked up with the sand , or they 'll smash in the gun . And you , " he said to Gail , " stay on his left . You wo n't be able to see a damn thing down there beyond about two feet , so do n't wander . Here . " He gave her a canvas tote bag . " He 'll pass you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ern in there . When the bag 's full , you tap him , he 'll tap me , and you 'll lug it up . Do n't come up without telling me ;  | I need time to move the gun . If I get too far ahead of you , the sand 'll cover the ampules before you can gather ' em . If anything goes wrong , Adam 'll shut off the compressor . It 'll get hard to breathe right away , but you can probably get one more breath out of it . Come up as close to the bow as you can and hug the boat . You 're hard to see up there , and if there 's anybody aboard wants to do you dirt , you 'll have at least a couple breaths before you have to go down again . Okay ? " " Okay , " said Sanders . " I . . . " Gail hesitated . " Say it , " Treece told her . " Get it out now . I do n't want you springing surprises on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " She pointed at the Desco masks and coils of yellow tubing . " It scares me . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . Claustrophobia , I guess . I ca n't stand the thought of being . . . tethered . If someone turned off the compressor , I think I 'd have a stroke . " " C'm on , " Sanders said . " It 's the truth , " she said . " I ca n't help it . " Treece said , " No problem . Rather have you comfortable than all jeebly and upset . Use a tank . We 've got plenty . " " Thanks . " " Anybody got anything else to say , say it now . Once I fire up that beast , you wo n't be able to hear yourselves think . " " You want wet suits ? " Sanders asked . " Aye . We 'll be down a long time . The water 's warm , but not that warm . After an hour , you 'll be shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a screw driver from a tool box , primed the compressor , and touched the screw driver to two contact points on the starter motor . Sparks jumped from the contacts , and the compressor roared to life . Sanders went below . The cabin of Corsair looked like a divers ' flea market . Coils of rope and chain hung from the overhead . Two salt-spotted fishing rods rested on bulkhead brackets . In one corner there was a tangle of old regulator hoses , the rubber cracked and rotten . Tools  --  hammers , chisels , screw drivers , wrenches  --  littered the bunks . There was no door on the compartment that housed the head ; for toilet paper , a Sunday newspaper supplement had been shredded and tacked to the bulkhead . Sanders found a heap of wet suits , masks , and flippers . He sorted wet-suit tops and bottoms , trying to make matches for himself and Gail . Beneath the pile , he saw a rusty knife and a rubber sheath with straps designed to bind it to a diver 's calf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wet suits topside . Gail was threading two-pound weights onto her belt . He gave her a wet suit and said , " What do you normally use , six pounds ? " " Yes . " " The suit 'll double your buoyancy . You might dump those twos and load up with three or four fours . " Gail nodded . She saw the knife in his hand . " What 're you planning to do with that ? " " I do n't know . Dig in the sand . I found it below . " Treece threw the aluminum tube overboard . It lay on the water for a moment , churning the surface , then slowly 176  | sank , trailing the coil of pink tubing behind it . A stream of bubbles popped to the surface . Treece yelled to Sanders . " Throw that coil over to port . I 'll put mine over starboard . Keep ' em from snarling right off . " Sanders threw the yellow coil over . It floated , and air bubbled from the face mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the regulator , and helped Gail into the straps . Then he strapped the knife onto his right leg , added ten pounds to his own weight belt , and buckled it around his middle . He wiggled his feet into his flippers and said , " I guess I 'm ready . It feels strange : no tank , no mask . " Gail said , " Throw me the sack when I get myself together , okay ? " " Sure . " Gail rolled backward off the gunwale . She cleared her mask and held up a hand . Sanders leaned over the side , gave her the handles of the canvas bag ; she waved and dove toward the bottom . Treece went over next , then Sanders  --  jumping beside the coil of hose , retrieving the mask , and slipping it over his head . As Sanders kicked downward , he sorted out his feelings about diving with the Desco apparatus . His field of vision was much greater than with an ordinary mask ; he could see his nose . The air hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool . It was nice not to have a rubber mouthpiece in his mouth ; he found he could talk to himself . But he was also aware of a faint tug at his head . He looked up and saw the rubber coil snaking down behind him . He saw 177  | Treece 's air hose leading across the bottom toward the reef , and he followed it . Treece was waiting at the mouth of the cave , holding the aluminum air lift well above the bottom . Even underwater , it emitted a loud noise , like a strong wind rushing between buildings . When David and Gail joined him , Treece positioned them beside the cave . He made a circle of thumb and forefinger and looked at them . He said , " Okay ? " The word was thick and indistinct , but the meaning was clear . They responded with the " okay " sign . Treece touched the mouth of the air lift to the sand . Instantly , sand vanished from the bottom . It looked to Sanders like a speeded-up film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes . In seconds there was a hole a foot wide and half a foot deep . Sand and pebbles were blown out the back end of the tube , causing a dense , blossoming cloud . The tide was running to the right , tending to carry the cloud away from them , but the wave action on the reef fought the tide , and soon Sanders found he had to lie on the sand to see the hole . The tip of an ampule showed through the sand , quivering against the force of the suction . Sanders grabbed the ampule and passed it to Gail . She set it on the bottom of the bag . The hole was deeper now , and suddenly a side gave way . Sand rose in Sanders ' face . Through the fog he saw a shower of glimmers ; he reached into the hole and closed his hand around several ampules . Treece raised the air lift , letting the sand settle so Sanders could see to collect the am-178  | pules . Then Treece moved the tube a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was in a field of ampules , some clear , some yellow , and a few amber . Gail moved closer to Sanders , taking the ampules from his hand as carefully as possible , setting them , one by one , in the canvas bag . It felt good to move around . The water inside her wet suit was warming to body temperature , and when she moved her arms or legs , pockets of water were squeezed from one part of the suit to another . She tried to count the ampules in the bag , but there were too many . She worried that if she kept adding more and more ampules , they might be crushed when she took them out of the water . Here they weighed almost nothing ; out of water the liquid might be dense enough to cause the ampules on the bottom of the bag to crack . She tapped Sanders on the shoulder and pointed to Treece , a hazy gray figure only three or four feet away . Sanders tapped Treece , who raised the air lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him the bag . He nodded and pointed upward . As she surfaced , the bag acted as a sea anchor , holding her back . She had to struggle to make way , kicking as hard as she could and using her hand to force herself upward . She looked down and saw Treece tap Sanders and beckon him toward the reef . Coffin had seen her bubbles , and he was waiting on the diving platform . He took the bag from her , and as he looked into it , his eyes glazed in recollection . All he said was " Aye . " Gail hauled herself onto the platform and lay on her stomach , panting . 179  | " Next time , " Coffin said , " leave your weights on the bottom . Makes it easier . " Gail said , " Yes , " and chided herself for not having thought of it . " I 'll have this bag emptied for you in a jiff ; just want to stow the glass . " She pushed herself into a sitting position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gail could hear a tinkling sound as he removed the ampules from the bag . " No trouble ? " she called . " Not a peep . I do n't guess the bastard 'll try anything with all them folks on the beach . He 's a piece of work underwater , ai n't he ? " " Treece ? I suppose . Is the air lift hard to handle ? " " For most men . It can buck like a goat . But Treece 'll hold it steady as a tree for five and six hours at a go . I think he 'd stay down there all his life if he could . He 's been happiest down there , away from people , for a long time . " Coffin 's voice trailed off . " What do you mean , a long time ? " " You do n't know ? " " I guess not . " " Well , it ai n't my place to tell tales . " " Mr. Coffin , " Gail said , controlling her annoyance , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something about Treece that everybody but us seems to know , and nobody will say . We 're living in the man 's house , sleeping in his bed . I think we have a right to know something . " Coffin picked the last of the ampules from the bag . " Maybe you do . All I 'll tell you is this : He was married . " He walked aft . 18o  | " Where 's his wife ? " " Dead . " He handed her the bag . " Two hundred and forty-six . Got a long way to go . " Gail looked at Coffin , debating whether to press him for more information . She decided not to try : If he wanted to talk , he would  --  when he close to . Pressing might anger him . She lowered her mask over her face , bit down on her mouthpiece , and slipped off the diving platform into the water . Underwater , she rolled the bag into a ball to keep it from dragging . She looked down and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left of the cave . Through the cloud of sand that billowed above them she could not tell which man was which . She started down , and the water that seeped into her wet suit felt cold . She wondered how much air she had left , looking forward to the interlude that would come when she had to change tanks . The sun would feel good , and perhaps she could coax Coffin into sharing a few more facts about Treece 's wife . She swam through the floating sand and felt dusty motes cling to her hair . She heard a hammering sound , as though someone were working on an anvil . Blinded by the sand , she was suddenly rammed in the chest by a blast of air and pebbles ; she had swum to within inches of the discharge from the air lift . She recoiled and let herself fall to the bottom . Debris rained around her as she crawled forward . Treece was banging the end of the air lift against the coral , trying to break off a piece so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist-size chunk of coral broke loose and rattled up the tube . Treece felt with his fingers , then shook his 181  | head : his hand was too large . He pointed to Sanders , who worked his fingers into the hole and withdrew them , clutching a green crusty piece of metal , which he passed to Treece . Gail tapped Treece , to let him know she was there . He turned and gestured for her to open the bag . She unfolded it , and he dropped the relic inside . Then he led them back toward the cave . Sand had drifted into the hole Treece had made , and now there was a barely perceptible dent in the bottom . Treece positioned the Sanderses as they had been before and touched the air gun to the sand . For the first six inches , as Treece redug the hole , there was nothing but sand . But soon he found the carpet of ampules , and Sanders plucked them , in twos and threes , from the shifting bottom and passed them to Gail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , Gail felt a deep , unpleasant chill . The water in her suit was still and clammy . Her body , needing to generate heat , sent a shiver into her arms , then her shoulders , then her neck . She hoped she would run out of air soon . Sanders picked the last two ampules from the hole . Treece backed up a foot or two , touched the gun to fresh sand , and , in half a minute , exposed countless new ampules . A lump appeared in the bottom of the hole , a hard cone . Sand slipped away from it until Sanders could see a metallic green peak . Suddenly he knew what it was : an artillery shell . He reached for it , and quickly Treece hit his hand with the air lift , then raised the air lift over his head and looked at Sanders . He held up the index finger of his left 182  | kind : Pay attention , he was saying . He pointed to the green cone and shook his finger , then pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He pointed at Sanders , at the air lift , at the cone : Take this and train it on that thing . Sanders nodded and reached for the tube . There was a circular grip near the mouth . Treece kept his hand on the grip until Sanders seemed to have firm grasp , and then Treece let go . Watching Treece use the gun  --  his hand on the grip , the tube tucked snugly under his arm  --  Sanders had concluded that the air lift was a docile beast , so he held the grip loosely . The mouth of the tube drifted across the bottom , sucking up sand and stones . Suddenly the tube inhaled a stone it could n't pass , and , clogged , it jumped from Sanders ' hand and slammed into his armpit . Whipped by a hundred feet of hose full of compressed air , the tube bounced Sanders along the bottom like a Yo-Yo . Sanders wrapped his arms around the tube and tried to dig his heels into the sand , but the tube snapped him upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surface and streaks of gray and brown as he was swept past the reef . I-Ic relaxed his hold , trying to free himself from the tube , and it cracked him across the ribs . Then the tube fell still . Gasping , peering through a swirl of sand and bubbles , Sanders saw Treece holding the bottom of the jumping air lift against the reef , banging it on a rock . He slammed it down again and again until , finally , the stone was disgorged . The tube swayed slowly in the tide . Treece made the " okay " sign and raised his eyebrows , 183  | questioning . Sanders touched his ribs and nodded . Treece gestured at the grip : Hold it steady , and it 'll behave . He led Sanders back to the hole . Gail touched his shoulder and looked worriedly into his eyes . He made the " okay " sign and dropped to his knees . Treece handed him the grip and fit the tube under his arm . Sanders held the grip so tightly that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , he nodded at Treece and dipped the gun to the sand . It twitched and hummed against his body , but held firm . Treece swam to the other side of the hole , facing Sanders , guiding him around the green cone , directing that he dig the hole wide enough so that it would n't collapse on itself . The shell was standing on end , and it widened  --  as sand was stripped from it  --  to a diameter of about six inches . It was coated with marine growths , but , judging by the way Treece was handling it , it was still very much alive . When the shell was almost free of sand , Treece wrapped his hands around its middle and gingerly lifted it from the bottom . He inspected it , then set it on the sand at the base of the reef . He took the air lift from Sanders and scoured the ragged hole for more ampules . The bag filled quickly . Gail was marrow-cold , longing for the sun 's warmth but unwilling to admit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few minutes until the bag was full enough . Then , to her delight , she felt the tightness of breath that signaled a nearly empty tank . She tapped Treece , ran her finger across her throat , and pointed to the surface . Treece gestured at the bag and 184  | raised his left hand , with two , then three , fingers extended ? telling her to bring down more bags . She nodded . As she rose toward the surface , she saw that Treece and Sanders were staying at the hole instead of moving to the reef . They were going to dig as many ampules as they could , as fast as they could . Ten or fifteen feet above the bottom , the weight of the bag reminded her to drop her weight belt . She unsnapped the belt buckle and watched the twelve pounds of lead drop to the sand . Again Coffin was waiting for her at the surface . As she passed him the bag , she said , " There 's something in the bottom . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it on the reef . " Gail took off her tank and passed it to Coffin . " You want a fresh one ? " Coffin asked . " Yes . He wants more bags . " " Should n't wonder . If what 's supposed to be down there is down there , it 'll take a bleeding eon to get it up with one bag . " Gail pulled herself onto the diving platform and unzipped her wet-suit jacket . She leaned back against the stern of the boat , letting the sun warm her cold , wet skin . There were tender spots on her face , at the pressure points from the mask , and her mouth felt stretched and sore from the mouthpiece  --  as if a dentist had been working on a back tooth and hyperextended her lips . She wiped her nose and saw blood on her hand . " Tired ? " Coffin said as he unloaded the ampules. 185  | " Exhausted . " " I 'll take a trip , then . There 's nothing going on up here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , not sure why she was rejecting his offer . " I 'll take one more . If something does happen , better to have you here . " " At least we 'll rig up something to make it easier . " Gail rested for a few more minutes , then climbed into the boat and disconnected her regulator from the empty air tank . As she prepared a new tank , she tried to think of a subtle way to get Coffin talking about Treece 's wife . There was no subtle way , so finally she said , " What did Treece 's wife die of ? " Coffin glanced at her , then concentrated on the bag . " I 'm counting , " he said , dropping ampules into plastic sandwich bags . " There . Fifty . " He tied off the sandwich bag and started to fill another one . Gail was silent until she had finished working on her tank . Coffin dropped the last ampule in the plastic bag and tied it off . " Has she been dead long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That 's four fifty-six altogether . " He reached into the bottom of the canvas bag and removed the piece of green metal . " Hello . " " What is it ? " " An escutcheon plate . " He held it up . The plate was shaped like a fleur-de-lis . In each of the leaves there was a keyhole . Around the edges were six holes where nails had been . " Covered the lock on a box or chest . What 's he want with that ? " " He did n't say . " 186  | Coffin set the escutcheon plate on the shelf in front of the steering wheel . " It 's just brass . " Gail paused . " If you wo n't tell me , " she said , " I 'll ask him . " Coffin opened a locker and took out two canvas bags and a coil of three-eighths-inch hemp . " That would be a cruel thing to do . " Coffin fed an end of the rope through the handles of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirty yards of rope , cut it , and tied the cut end to a cleat on the stern . He repeated the procedure with the other bag , securing the rope to a cleat amidships . When he was finished , he stared at the knife for a moment , thinking . Then he stabbed it into the gunwale and turned to Gail . " All right . I do n't want you asking him . I do n't want you giving him pain . He 's had his fill of that . " Embarrassed , Gail started to say something , but Coffin cut her off . " When he was a lad , he raised his share of hell on Bermuda . No more than most boys , I guess , but his hell-raising seemed to have a direction , as if he was trying to say something . He never shoplifted or robbed anything from common folks . Everything he did was against authority  --  the police or the British . I remember , the British tried to confiscate some common land on St. David 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all hot about it , claiming the land was theirs by rights . ' Course , the British took it anyway , but they had the devil 's own time building anything . Treece and his cronies tore things down as fast as they were built , sugared the gas tanks of all the construction equipment , things like that . 187  | " Anyway , when he was about twenty-three , he met a British girl , Priscilla . I forget her last name . She was here on holiday , and she met Treece in St. David 's , pretty much by accident . Lordy , she was a gorgeous girl ! And nice . A kinder , sweeter lass never drew breath . Treece taught her how to dive , how to look for wrecks  --  Christ , how to do everything but talk to fish . She taught him how to handle people , how to handle himself . Calmed him down like an oil slick on a wave . She went home to England but came back the next summer and took a job in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treece and her got married ? that must have been about 1958 , thereabouts . The proper Brits on Bermuda did n't take kindly to the marriage . They never did know what to make of St. David 's people . Sometimes they called ' em red niggers ; most often they pretended St. David 's did n't exist . But once Priscilla moved in with Treece on St. David 's  --  rather than the other way around , bringing him out into civilization where he could embarrass someone  --  they forgot about it . She kept her job in Hamilton , and he stayed on the island . " It was like Treece was all of a sudden a new person . There was no more anger in him , no room for it . There was too much happiness . " For two , maybe three years , everything was fine . They raised wrecks together . To keep the larder full , Treece did salvage work . His father was still alive then , so he did n't have the job with the light . One spring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Trinidad . It did n't yield much as treasures go  --  a gold bar , an emerald ring , a few other things  --  but it was enough to give him a 188  | fair poke . Right away , Priscilla got pregnant . Nobody knew it at the time ; it did n't come out till after . But they should 've known : she had the glow of life about her . She wore that emerald ring so proud , and she was near bursting with love and . . . well , I guess goodness is about the only word . " Like I said , she worked with kids , troubled kids , the ones who had n't done enough to merit a stay in the brig but who could n't quite handle everything society said they should handle . She loved those kids like they was her own . " This was around the time the drug thing was just getting big in the States . Not here ; it 's never amounted to much here . But there was talk about Bermuda being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving in Florida or Norfolk with a European cargo raises eyebrows , especially if it 's stopped at , say , Haiti or the other islands on the way . But sailboats on a round trip from the States to Bermuda , or businessmen down here for long weekends ? nobody paid them no mind . " One day , one of Priscilla 's kids got loose-lipped and spilled something about a schooner due from down south with a load of drugs . She thought it was just talk , but she mentioned it to Treece . Treasure-divers are wired into everywhere , every bar and fish market . They have to be , to pick up clues : so-and-so saw a pile of egg-rock ballast here ; somebody else spotted a strange timber there ; Hey , look at the coin I found off Spanish Rock . ' That kind of thing . So it was n't hard for Treece to check the rumor , and it was true . A private yacht was due into St. George 's with ten kilos of heroin . Part of it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread ; the rest would be stowed here and taken up north little by little by businessmen . ' " In those days , Treece still had some trust in the government . Priscilla had taught him that all authority was n't necessarily out to get him . So they went to the government , right to the top , and told what they knew . Well , the government did n't believe them , and , to be fair , there was n't much evidence for them to believe  --  fair , that is , considering that they were pigheaded about Treece from the start . They did n't have any idea how much he knew . As far as they were concerned , this was all rumor started by a kid . " That got Treece pretty riled , partly out of pride . Here he had the bloody goods on some people smuggling heroin , and the government would n't take his word . He decided to stop them himself and present the drugs to the government on a platter . He did n't know what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , like tell one too many people what he was up to . He was threatened a few times , and that got him still hotter . Priscilla tried to calm him down , but it was hard ' cause she agreed with him . " Not to burden you with all the details , Treece and some chums met the yacht outside St. George 's harbor and tried to board her . There was a bloody great rumpus , and the yacht steamed away . " " With the drugs ? " Gail asked . " Aye , but their plan was a wreck . Four days later , Priscilla was found dead at her desk in her office . The medical examiner said she had died of an overdose of drugs , and the case was closed . What people figure happened , one of the  | smugglers ' contacts here  --  his operation ruined  --  waited for her in her office one morning and , before anybody else got there , stuck a needle in her . There were track marks on her arms , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she was a user . " Treece near went crazy , with grief and guilt and fury . He half-blamed himself , half-blamed the government . " " Did he ever find the man who killed her ? " " No one knows . . . for sure . But about a week after she died , a man was found in St. George 's , high in the top branches of a tree . Every bone in his body had been broken at the joints . His fingers were all bent upward , his arms bent backward , same with his knees and his toes . His head was turned full around , like someone had tried to unscrew it . He was a bartender , mostly unemployed but always with ready cash . Nobody was ever prosecuted , and the only reason anybody connects it with Treece is that it had to have been some powerful man who splintered that fellow and hauled him fifty feet off the ground . " For about a month , Treece stayed drunk , morning , noon , and night , guzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his house , and the only people who dared go near it were the folks delivering booze and food . Then one day he came out and started diving , did all manner of crazy-ass things : dove alone , in foul weather , went too deep and stayed too long . It was like he was trying to purge himself , or kill himself , and he damn near did that : got bent up like a pretzel and had to spend three days in a decompression chamber . A fisherman found him floating on the surface . " " What brought him down ? " 190 191  | " Down ? You mean back to normal ? Time , I guess . But what 's normal ? He 's never been the same as he was before she died . I doubt he ever will . " " Was Cloche involved ? " Coffin paused . " I 'd bet on it , but there 's no proof . Anyway , the important thing is , Treece sees the same thing happening again . " After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She felt a sadness , a vicarious pain for Treece . She tried to form a mental picture of his wife , but the only image that fit was herself . Coffin held the scuba tank for her while she put on the harness and straightened the straps . He handed her the canvas bag she had brought up and said , " When you 're in , 1 ' 11 give you the other two . Take ' em down and set a rock on ' em so they wo n't drift away . When they 're full , give three tugs on the line , and I 'll haul ' em up . Follow ' em , though , to make sure they do n't tip . " " Okay . " She stepped over the transom onto the diving platform , checked tank and mask , and jumped into the water . Pulling the ropes behind her , she swam for the bottom . Without weights , she tended to float , and she had to use both arms to aid her descent . She found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made her way toward the cloud of sand . She had been gone longer than she thought . A mound of ampules more than a foot high and two feet wide rose in the sand beside David . She kneeled on two bags and opened the third . She found she could scoop handfuls of  | ampules off the mound and drop them in the bag ; they floated safely to the bottom . She filled one bag , then another , then the third . She tapped Sanders to let him know she was going up , and tugged three times on the two ropes . As she unbuckled her weight belt , the two ropes tightened and the bags rose . She grabbed the ropes with one hand and , holding the untethered bag with the other , let herself be dragged to the surface . " You 're bleeding , " Coffin said . Gail crossed her eyes and saw bloody water washing around her nose . She tilted her head back and blew her mask clear . " I know . It 's nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip ? " " I 'll do one more . " Carefully , Coffin pushed the ampules out of the bags onto a tarpaulin he had spread on the deck . " I 'll count ' em while you 're down , " he said , passing the bags to Gail . She went down again , and this time she felt pain  --  a tight ache in the sinus cavities above her eyes . She stopped a few feet below the surface , struggling to maintain depth , and waited for the pain to subside . She descended farther , until the pain stopped her and forced her to wait . This is the last one , she thought : too many ups and downs . There was pressure now on her ears , too , and she made herself yawn . She felt two squeaky pops , and the pressure was gone . As she started down again , she saw something move  --  a grayish blur at the edge of the gloom beyond the reef . She looked harder , straining to see through the haze . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  | movement . She turned her head , trying to anticipate where it might appear next . Behind her , away from the cloud of sand , the water was clearer , and as she turned , she saw it : gliding out of the fog as if from behind a curtain was a shark . It moved with sure , unhurried grace , thrust through the water by smooth strokes of its crescent tail . A knot of panic struck Gail 's stomach . She was more than halfway to the bottom , and she remembered David 's warning about not fleeing for the surface . She could not tell how big the shark was , for , in open water , there was nothing against which to measure it . Nor could she tell how far away it was ; it cruised at the outer limit of her vision . But how far could she see ? Fifty feet ? Sixty ? The shark swam in a wide circle , and as streaks of sunlight caught its back , Gail could see faint stripes along its sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye seemed to be watching her , but it registered no interest , no curiosity . Still holding the ropes , she continued down toward the belching air lift . She found her weights , strapped them on , and tapped Treece . When he looked at her , with her right hand she made a sinuous swimming motion , then , with her fingers , a biting motion . She pointed off to the right , where she guessed the shark would be by now . Treece looked in the direction she was pointing , but , surrounded by drifting sand , he saw nothing . He looked back at her , shook his head , and , with a curt wave of his hand , dismissed the danger . Sanders was not sure he understood what Gail had told Treece . He recalled her nervousness in the company of a  | barracuda and assumed she had seen another one . But seeing the wide-eyed fear on her face , he wondered . He put the heels of his hands together , spread his fingers , then slammed them closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her , raised his eyebrows , and spread his arms , asking , How big ? She shrugged : Ca n't tell . But she spread her arms as wide as she could : At least this big . Sanders noticed that half an inch of bloody water was washing around in her mask . He pointed to it and shook his finger , telling her not to clear the mask , not to put blood in the water . She nodded , but misunderstood . Before he could stop her , she pressed the top of her faceplate and exhaled through her nose . A stream of green , mucous water flushed from her mask and drifted off in the tide . Sanders smacked himself on the forehead and shook his head . He pointed to the drifting threads of blood . Gail 's eyes looked stricken . She touched his arm and pointed to the surface , asking if she should go up . He held her wrist and shook his head firmly : No . He pointed to an empty canvas bag , picked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ditch Treece had excavated contained a major lode . There were ampules everywhere , poking up through the sand like raisins in a rice pudding . Picking carefully with the air lift among the artillery shells , Treece would touch a leaf of rotten wood and let the suction peel the leaf away , revealing forty-eight ampules , in eight neat rows of six . Sanders could not keep up with Treece . He plucked four , six , ten ampules from the sand at a time and passed  | them back to Gail , but always Treece would have uncovered more . He tried to lift a full box , but though it looked intact , it had no bottom , and the ampules fell away in the sand . He cupped his hands , scooped fifteen or twenty ampules , and turned to give them to Gail . Her hands were n't there . He turned , angrily , to face her , and saw her staring at the reef . The shark was no more than ten feet away , moving from right to left between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet long , a sleek torpedo of muscle . It watched them , but made no move toward them , and Sanders wondered if it was seeking the source of the blood in the water . He reached to his calf and unsheathed the knife . He saw that Treece had not noticed the shark . He tapped him and pointed , as the shark swam away to the left , keeping a steady ten or twelve feet from the divers and four or five feet from the reef . Treece watched the shark pass Gail and turn , perhaps twenty feet away , diasppearing behind the cloud of sand . He rapped his knuckles on the air lift and shook his head . He seemed to be saying , Stay calm . With the knife in his right hand , Sanders had only his left free to gather ampules , and that hand could n't accomplish much because Gail would n't take any more ampules from him ; she stayed rigid on her knees , clutching a halffull bag and waiting , panicked , for the shark to reappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right , still keeping its distance but , Sanders thought , slightly closer than on its previous pass . It approached the preoccupied Treece and moved toward Sanders , who crouched , holding  | the knife in front of him . Then Gail saw it , and , shocked , she flailed her arms . The shark saw the movement , and its head twitched , dipping toward Gail . Gail 's arm touched Sanders ' side , and the sensation was a trigger that snapped him forward . His right hand was extended , the knife blade pointing up . The shark saw him coming and dodged , its head jerking to the right , its tail thrashing twice . But instinct told it to avoid the reef , and , apparently confused , it slowed enough to let Sanders jab the knife into its underside , a foot ahead of the tail . Sanders ' only conscious thought was how soft the flesh was ; the knife went in up to the hilt . Then the body convulsed and tore the knife from his hand . Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shark darted away , swimming erratically , its body shuddering , tail twitching . The head turned and the jaws snapped at the bleeding belly . The shark was trying to eat itself . The knife had fallen a few feet away , and Sanders swam to retrieve it , worried that the shark would return and , in anger , attack . But it was not the shark that attacked . Sanders felt a hand grip his ankle and drag him backward . Lying on his back , he gazed into Treece 's furious eyes . He saw Treece 's lips moving , and he heard sounds , but no words . Treece grabbed Sanders ' arm and yanked him to his feet . His fingers completely circled Sanders ' upper arm and , on the inside of the arm where they met , pinched painfully . Scared and confused , Sanders did n't know what he had 197  | done to enrage Treece , and as he looked into the shouting face , he was genuinely afraid that Treece might kill him . Treece grabbed the knife from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It rattled up the tube . Then Treece pointed at the surface and started up . He stopped , returned , and gathered up one of the artillery shells . Gail still crouched on the bottom . Sanders took her arm and helped her to her feet , pulled three times on one of the ropes , and guided her hand to it when the rope was tightened by Coffin 's pull . As he swam with Gail to the surface , Sanders saw a gray shadow moving in the distance . Hazy as it was , Sanders could see that it was big , much bigger than a man . When he neared the boat , he looked down and saw the wounded shark , twisting and rolling on the reef . Then the air stopped flowing into his mask . He kicked to the surface , exhaling the last of his air . He grabbed the diving platform with one hand , removed his mask , and said , " Hey , what . . . " The sound of Treece 's voice silenced him . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do I ever saw in my life ! " Treece was already in the boat , railing , Sanders assumed , at Coffin , who had turned off the compressor . Sanders dipped his face in the water to clean his nose , so he did n't see the hand that reached for him . He heard the word " You ! " and felt himself grabbed under one arm and hoisted out of the water and over the transom . His feet slammed onto the deck .  | Gail , hanging off the platform , watched Sanders fly out of the water , and a picture struck her : a man , wedged high in a tree , with his limbs splayed backward . Treece held Sanders by the arm and shook him , snapping his head back and forth . " What in the name of the gentle Jesus do you think you 're doing ? You think you 're goddamned Tarzan ? You 're a goddamned hazard , that 's what ! " " What . . . " " Bugger up a day 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to take Gail 's tank off the platform . Sanders rubbed the welts on his arm . " She was bleed- 1 ing ! " " Cat shit ! " " She was ! In her mask . She cleared it into the water . " Treece looked at Coffin and said , " Christ , spare me from idiots . " He turned back to Sanders and opened his mouth to shout , but apparently changed his mind . " All right , " he said , struggling against his temper . " First off , that little fish was n't about to eat us . " " Little ! " Sanders said . " That thing was at least seven feet long . " Confident now that Treece was not going to hurt him , he felt embarrassed , aggressively resentful . He wanted to question Treece 's declarative cockiness . " If it was five feet , I 'm the King of Spain . Water magnifies everything . " Sanders felt himself blush . " Even so . . . " " Second , " Treece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to make him more than a little nosy . He was hav-199  | ing a look-see . If he 'd have got serious , you 'd have seen the excitement ripple along his body ; he 'd 've got real agitated . And soon as I spotted that , all we had to do is gather together in the air-lift cloud . Sharks wo n't go in it , or if they do , they 'll get the hell out in a hurry without waiting to bite anything . The sand clogs their gills , and they hate that : it can kill ' em . I had his grandfather try to eat me once  --  a big bastard of a tiger shark , all of fifteen feet long ? and I just waited him out in the cloud . But sticking him with a knife is the last bloody thing in the world you want to do . The last ! When you 've got no other choice , when it 's either stick him or be dinner , then you stick him . But not before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . They 're not supposed to have enough brains to get angry , but I tell you , I 've seen ' em do a right fancy imitation of being pissed off . You want to see another reason , get in the water . " " What ? Where ? " Treece tossed him a face mask . " Put this on and hang off the platform . " He said to Gail , " You , too . But for Christ 's sake , do n't go tooting off somewhere . " Tentatively , not knowing what to expect , David and Gail slipped off the platform and clung to the chains that attached it to the boat . They held their breaths and put their faces in the water . The scene thirty feet away , on the reef , looked like a gang fight . All that remained of the shark Sanders had stabbed were a few mutilated pieces , and those were being fought over , with savage frenzy , by countless other sharks . Half a dozen large tiger sharks flailed in a blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller shark chased a shred of flesh to the bottom , took it in his mouth , and sped away , pursued by two others . There were sharks everywhere , swimming in frantic bursts , responding to smells and sounds and commotion in the water , searching for prey . Some were gray , some brown , some striped . Large sharks took random swipes at smaller ones , who darted out of reach  --  or , when they were not quick enough , were wounded and set upon by the mob . As the Sanderses watched , more and more dark , sinuous shapes glided out of the twilight blue . One cruised directly beneath the boat , and , seeing something on the surface , rose toward them . They hoisted themselves onto the platform and climbed into the boat . Treece and Coffin were counting ampules on the deck . Treece did not look up . " See what you did ? " He was not gloating ; his tone of voice said simply : Now you understand . " I see . " Gail said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till the food runs out . But if they 're beating up on each other like they usually do , the food wo n't run out . They 'll be there a good long while . " " So today 's wiped , " Sanders said . " I 'm sorry . " " Aye . " Treece relented . " It 's no great tragedy . We got a fair load for today , and one thing about those beasts : They 'll keep anybody else from messing around down there . " Gail shivered . She removed her wet-suit top and dried herself . " How many have you got ? " " Four thousand " ? Treece looked at Coffin ? " eight hun-20I  | dred and seventy , " Coffin said , wrapping the last plastic bag of ampules . " Not enough . " Treece looked at the shore . " And not much bloody time . I imagine Cloche has had people on the bluffs all day . " Coffin said , " He ca n't make ' em into good divers in two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't send a bunch of bunnies out here to pick around in the sand with their fingers . " " Two days , no . But not much more than that , to make ' em middling competent . And when he 's ready , they 're going to come fast . I think maybe we 'll be working nights , too . " He saw a look of chagrin on Gail 's face , and he said , " Not tonight . We 'll give your bugle a rest . " " What will you do with this ? " Sanders rested his hand on the artillery shell . " Nothing , for now . I just wanted to get it out of there . Later on , I 'll clean it up and sell the brass . " " Is it really live , after thirty years ? " " Aye . " Treece said . He set the shell in a vise bolted to the starboard gunwale . From a locker he took a huge wrench which he fit to the bottom of the shell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't budge . " Corroded into a bloody weld . " He braced his foot against the bulkhead , wrapped both hands around the wrench , and leaned back . His biceps balled into tight knots ; the sinews in his neck strained against the skin , and a red hue suffused his face . There was a metallic squeak , then the sound of a crack , and the wrench handle moved . Treece heaved again and  | broke the seal . He unscrewed the bottom of the shell and dropped it on the deck . " Look here . " The interior of the shell was filled with stiff , gray , spaghettilike strands , bunched tightly together . Coffin handed Treece a pair of pliers and a box of matches . Treece fished one of the strands from the shell casing and , holding it with the pliers , gave Sanders the matches . " Light it . " " What is it ? " " Cordite . That 's what makes everything explode . " Sanders held a match to the end of the cordite strand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliance of magnesium . Gail said , " That 's all there is to a shell that big ? " " All ? Christ , girl , pack a hundred of ' em together and touch a primer charge to ' em , and you can blow Bermuda to pieces . " " How many are there ? " " No way to know , " Coffin said . " There was about ten ton when we started , but some of it 's been salvaged . " Treece tossed the cordite overboard . It hissed as it hit f ' . the water , and , sinking , emitted a stream of bubbles . They fetched the air hoses from the water and coiled them on the deck . Treece fastened the air-lift tube to the gunwale , then started the engine . Charlotte , who had been sleeping on the bow , lurched to her feet and  --  like a soldier reluctantly assuming a midnight watch  --  took her post on the pulpit . Coffin hoisted the anchor , and Treece eased the boat through the reefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Coffin said . " Early . Say eight o'clock . We 'll do four or five hours in the morning , dry off for the afternoon , and start again around six . " He teased Coffin . " I know you old folks need your afternoon nap . " " The hell you say ! " The boat was still seventy-five yards from shore . " I 'll outlast ' em all . " Coffin hopped onto the gunwale and dove overboard . Treece watched , grinning , until he saw Coffin surface and start to swim toward shore . Then he swung the boat seaward . As the boat rose and fell in the gentle swells , something slid off the steering console and clattered to the deck : the escutcheon plate . Gail picked it up and handed it to Treece . " Lordy , I almost forgot about that , " he said , adding , with a smile at Sanders , " what with all the excitement caused by the daredevil shark hunter . " " Adam said it was a plate that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just any lock . I 've heard of these , but I 've never seen one . I do n't know that any others still exist . It was called a three-lock box . See the three keyholes ; it took three keys to open the lock . " Sanders said , " What was the point of that ? " " To keep one or two people from making off with the goodies inside . Three partners , three keys . Say someone was sending something from the New World back to Spain . The King had a master set , all three keys . The man in wherever it was  --  Havana  --  probably had two , the captain of the ship one . They locked the box in Havana , and 204.  | the captain took it aboard ship . He could n't open it with only one key . When he got to Spain , he presented the box to the King . " " Would n't be hard to pry open . " " No , but they did n't usually . The Spaniards took locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special . The British and Dutch sent documents and what-all back and forth in regular boxes ; if a ship was pirated , that was that . No lock would do any good . The Spaniards locked everything , almost symbolically . But a three-lock box ! " Treece ran his fingers over the escutcheon plate . " Aye , that is interesting . " " Why ? " " It means there was something very damned important in that box . More'n likely , something very damned important to the King of Spain . " 205  | By the time they tied up to Treece 's dock , the sun was resting on the western horizon , a swollen ball of orange . Treece sniffed the evening air and said , " Going to get messy tomorrow . " Sanders ' impulse was to ask Treece how he knew the weather would change , but by now he could anticipate the answer , something like " Got a feeling " or " You can smell a breeze coming . " So he said instead , " How bad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll bounce us around a fair amount . " " Can we work ? " zo6  | " Got no choice . Cloche 'll be working , you can bet on that . It 'll be all right ; we 'll weight-up heavy . " Sanders began to peel off his wet-suit pants , but Treece stopped him . " We 're not done yet . " " We 're not ? " " Got to put away the ampules . Ca n't leave ' em lying around on the boat . " " I know , but I figured . . . " He stopped when he saw Treece pointing overboard at the dark water . " Oh . " " I want you to know where they are , in case something happens to me . " " What 's going to happen to you ? " " Who knows ? Maybe a terminal case of the ague , or a sudden onset of heebie-jeebies . Maybe nothing . It 's just insurance . There 's a cave underwater at the base of the cliff . Tide washes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bury ' em , they 'll stay . " He turned to Gail . " You do n't need to come . " " I can , " she said , " if you want me to . " " No . You 'll be more use up here , passing bags to us . " They rigged two scuba tanks and brought the bags of ampules up from below . Treece half-filled the canvas bags , then handed Sanders a flashlight . " Overweight yourself , " he said . " That bag 'll want to come to the surface . Adam squeezed all the air he could out of the plastic bags , but you ca n't get every last bit . If you 're way heavy , you can let your weights drag you and the bag to the bottom . When you get down , follow my light . " " Okay . " 207
