" The pace of stories in the energy field used to be almost leisurely , " recalls Correspondent Sam Iker , whose reporting on Federal Energy Office Chief William Simon forms the nucleus of this week 's cover story . As TIME 'S resident expert in Washington on environment and energy stories since 1971 , Iker has covered the gradual escalation of fuel-oil crunches , gasoline pinches , allocation battles and embargoes , and watched the subject of energy explode from a neglected issue into a vast and complex national crisis . " The intricacies of the oil business alone are mind-boggling , " he points out , " not to mention the nuclear power situation , natural gas questions , coal , strip-mining , offshore drilling and oil-shale controversies and electric power problems . " <P> When TIME 'S Energy section made its debut last November , Iker notes , " The pace became even more hectic . " One Saturday night six weeks ago , guests began arriving at Iker 's home in Chevy Chase , Md. , for an 8 o'clock dinner party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Love , Nixon 's chief energy adviser . As the first guest arrived , the phone rang , and I was notified that Love was to be replaced by Simon . As we passed by each other at the front door , I told my guests to help themselves to a drink . " Three hours later , Iker had filed for a late-starting TIME story on Simon and arrived at his own dinner party just in time for dessert . " Everyone was having so much fun by then , " Iker says , " that I figured I had discovered the key to a successful dinner party : dash off to work when the guests arrive . " <P> Collaborating with Iker on that last-minute effort was Associate Editor George J. Church , a TIME Business writer since 1969 who wrote this week 's cover story with the help of Reporter-Researchers Bonita Siverd and Gail Perlick . Like former Bond Trader William Simon , Church got his start on Wall Street , first as a correspondent and later as a front-page editor for the Wall Street Journal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the ten best newspapers in America ) . No skeptic about the reality of the energy crunch , Church had a lengthy debate with his conscience last week when wet snow started to fall on his Dix Hills , L.I. , home , 40 miles from the Time &; Life Building . " I 've been trying not to drive to work any more , " he says , " but the trains were unreliable , and after 15 phone calls I still could n't get a cab . Finally , I had to dig out the car . " The author of cover stories on , among other things , American inefficiency , Henry Ford , George P. Shultz and the devaluation of the dollar , Church has won two awards for business and financial writing . Fascinated by the impact Simon has had on the public , Church notes : " Last year Simon was hardly known at all - even on Wall Street . I ca n't think of any bureaucrat who has ever come on so strong in one month . Today he is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
