A white woman claims she 's disadvantaged too <P> To the discomfiture of many traditional civil rights advocates , Rita Greenwald Clancy was inspecting cadavers alongside 102 other freshman medical students at the University of California , Davis , last week . Admitted to the medical school through a federal court order , Clancy , 22 , had managed to exploit one of the main arguments used to justify affirmative-action programs for minority job and school applicants . <P> The same beleaguered U.C.-Davis medical school is already reeling from a suit filed by Allan Bakke , a white who claimed he was excluded because the university reserved 16 of 100 places in its entering class for blacks , Chicanos , American Indians , Puerto Ricans and Asians . <P> The California Supreme Court ruled 6 to 1 last year that Bakke was the victim of race discrimination , and the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the university 's appeal Oct. 12 in the most publicized civil rights case of recent years . <P> Like many institutions , Davis bases its special admissions program on grounds that extraordinary consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination problems . <P> In practice , that often means lower admission requirements for blacks , Spanish-surnamed Americans and , especially in California , Asians . Clancy , who married a Los Angeles public defender last year , believes her disadvantaged background fits the special-program criteria . A Russian-born Jew whose parents were imprisoned in concentration camps , she immigrated only seven years ago to the U.S. , where her impoverished family had to accept public assistance . Despite serious problems with English and the necessity of holding a part-time job , she managed an A+ average at U.C.L.A. and was placed at the top of one of the Davis medical school waiting lists . Her request to be considered for the special disadvantaged program was refused . <P> Why should a Clancy face stiffer entrance requirements than , say , the son of a more prosperous black family ? U.S. <P> Judge Thomas J. MacBride apparently could not fathom any overwhelming reason , and , citing potential " irreparable injury " to Clancy , ordered Davis to admit her , at least temporarily . A U.S. Ninth Circuit panel refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow Clancy to pursue her studies , pending the outcome of the Bakke challenge . In all likelihood , Bakke 's fate notwithstanding , Mrs. Clancy will thus become Dr. Clancy by 1981. -
