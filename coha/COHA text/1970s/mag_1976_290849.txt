Watching her patient come out of a coma , the nurse asked a traditional question : " Do you know where you are ? " Congressman Wayne Hays nodded . " Where ? " she persisted . Slowly , stretching out the word , he replied : " Barnes ... ville . " Hays had survived an excessive dose of sleeping pills , mind undamaged , and would keep his place at the center of a congressional scandal that grew still more lurid last week . <P> Whether Hays had purposefully tried to end his life-and his agony - was not immediately clear . Richard Phillips , Hays ' family physician and friend , had prescribed Dalmane , a standard " hypnotic agent " or soporific , because the besieged Congressman was understandably tense . Hays also had been eating little and was suffering from diverticulitis , an intestinal ailment . <P> His Ohio constituents had just renominated him for a 15th House term - the margin over a feeble opponent was much smaller than usual-but Hays ' Democratic colleagues gave him a resounding vote of no confidence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional Campaign Committee , and were ready to dislodge him from his other place of power , the House Administration Committee . <P> Suicide Talk . After swallowing that defeat , Hays returned to his lavishly furnished farmhouse in Belmont County , Ohio , late Wednesday night and took an undetermined amount of Dalmane . The next morning his wife Pat could not rouse him . He was rushed to an intensive care unit by ambulance . At first , Phillips insisted that the weakened Hays , who is 65 , had merely overreacted to a Dalmane pill . After the patient was out of danger , the doctor had another reading : " There is no question that he overdosed , but to say whether it was accidental or purposeful at this time would be pure speculation . " Associates both in Ohio and on Capitol Hill said that Hays had been despondent . His wife 's cold anger over his hanky-panky particularly shook him . He talked about committing suicide if his legal and political troubles worsened . <P> Worsen they did . The ripples of Elizabeth Ray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME discovered last week , had landed a current version of Watergate 's Deep Throat . This anonymous source , who might be tagged Jack the Tipper , has taken to calling the FBI three to four times a day . In tones of outrage , Jack has demonstrated pinpoint knowledge about some of Capitol Hill 's darker corners . Investigators believe that he may be a member of Congress or a legislative aide . " Whoever he is , " says one official involved in the inquiry , " he 's delivering the goods . " <P> For instance , Jack put the FBI on the trail of another young woman who worked for Hays a few years ago . Interviewed by FBI agents , she said that she got on the congressional payroll only after consenting to have sex with Hays several times a week . She quit when Hays suggested lunchtime copulation on his desk top . This source has also told investigators that Hays and other members of Congress cooperated in putting potentially embarrassing employees on each other 's staffs . The clear implication : a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll padding .
