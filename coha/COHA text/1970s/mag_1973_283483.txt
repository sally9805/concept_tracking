When the Portuguese landed on the south coast of the island in 1526 , they called it Papua , after a Malay word that described the fuzzy hair of the inhabitants . When the Spanish claimed the north coast 19 years later , they called it New Guinea , because they thought the natives resembled those on the Guinea Coast of Africa . Since the two territories became jointly administered by Australia in 1949 , they have gone by the hybrid mouthful of Papua New Guinea . The region is scheduled to become a single , self-governing nation in December , and the search is on for a new name . But there is one major problem : what heritage should it reflect ? <P> Because the territory is home to hundreds of tribes and has nearly 500 different dialects , it struck some members of the Papua New Guinea Executive Council that a new national name might plausibly come from pidgin-the colorful fractured English ( mirror , for example , is glas bilong lukluk ) that has become the lingua franca of the area . To test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed national airline Air Niugini . Papuans complained that this might be a happy solution for New Guineans but it was a slight to them . Not so , said the council . Besides being pidgin , niugini is made up of two words taken from the most widely used Papuan dialect , Motu . True , answered Papua critics , but surely the council knew what the Motu words mean : niu is coconut , and gini is stand . <P> As of last week , Michael Somare , the territory 's chief minister and a New Guinean from Wewak , seemed determined to stick by the new name . But Josephine Abaijah , a Papuan and sole woman member of the House of Assembly , was rallying the opposition . <P> Meanwhile , she has taken to calling the proposed airline " Air Coconuts .
