Begin , the Winner On the eve of his departure for the United States last week , Menahem Begin granted an interview to Flora Lewis of The New York Times , who noted repeatedly in her account that Begin seemed elated , chatty , grinning and buoyant . " Why should n't I be in a good mood ? " he asked , and one can not think of a single reason . Anwar Sadat may be everybody 's favorite to win the Nobel Peace Prize and be selected Time 's Man of the Year , but in the ongoing sweepstakes of international politics , where awards go to those who win lots and give little , the hands-down champion for 1977 is Menahem Begin of Israel . Unless he is smitten with hubris or otherwise overplays his hand and loses big , he stands on the verge of achieving all the main goals of Israeli diplomacy : a peace with Egypt , elimination of an Arab military threat against Israel , continued rich support from the United States , isolation of Syria , emasculation of the Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , restoration of Jordan as a negotiating partner on terms for a West Bank settlement and retention of secure borders . Begin will have to give up some captured territory to achieve his ends , but Israel probably will get peace on its terms and without returning to its 1967 borders or agreeing to a Palestinian state . Needless to say , Begin also is emerging a domestic hero . Begin could not have accomplished his triumphs without some help from President Carter , but it was unwitting ? the product of Carter 's freshman-year ineptitude that scared Sadat into dramatic independent action . The Carter administration 's insistence on reconvening the Geneva conference to reach a comprehensive Middle East settlement threatened to give veto power to the hardest-line parties on the Arab side , Syria and the Palestinians . The way the United States wanted negotiations to proceed , Egypt would have been blocked from making peace with Israel until Syria had the Golan Heights and the Palestinians had an independent state in the West Bank ? which is to say , never . The United States seemed bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the views of the PLO , if not PLO personalities , and by inviting the Soviet Union to take an active role as well as a ceremonial one . There was going to be a bustup at Geneva , perhaps followed by a war , and Sadat could see it coming , even if Zbigniew Brzezinski could not . Sadat 's flight to Jerusalem was an effort to leap-frog the trouble , but it also was an act of choice . Sadat picked Egypt 's national welfare and his own political well-being within Egypt ahead of his responsibilities as a leader of the broader Arab cause . In Jerusalem , he gave Israel ( and Begin ) two long-sought breakthroughs which other Arab countries had sought to withhold : recognition of Israel 's right to exist and the initiation of face-to-face negotiations . Syrian President Assad and PLO leader Arafat then did Israel the favor of joining the wildmen of the Arab rejection front in threats to punish Sadat , thereby liberating the Egyptian leader from their influence . Sadat owes no thanks for anything to Syria and the PLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Egypt in his talks with the Israelis , and forget them ? Israel will try to entice him with offers he can not refuse : the Sinai , peace , popularity , the chance for economic development . Egypt may be in line for Israeli technical assistance , and investment that Israel may be able to inspire from the United States and elsewhere . In return , Begin has achieved peace with Egypt , without whose forces the Arabs are incapable of fighting a real war . Israel , Egypt and the United States all maintain that they continue to be working for a comprehensive Middle East settlement , and they are . But they are proceeding far differently from the way the United States intended . After an embarrassing pause , the Carter administration was forced to reconsider over the Thanksgiving weekend how to remain active in Middle East diplomacy . Secretary of State Vance and Brzezinski reportedly wanted to continue looking toward a Geneva conference as before , while Vice President Mondale argued for a US role as supporter of the Begin-Sadat beginnings . Mondale won , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brzezinski , the conceptualizer , subsequently described the new US policy in terms of " concentric circles , " but it is really little different from Henry Kissinger 's old " step by step . " Will there be a next step ? This always was the problem with the Kissinger policy . Despair about establishing self-sustaining momentum after small initial steps is what inspired the Carter people to think comprehensively . However , an Egyptian-Israeli deal would be a big step , and would focus attention immediately on Jordan and the future of the West Bank . Secret talks between King Hussein and Moshe Dayan already have taken place , but it is not clear whether they have reached the stage of " negotiations . " The Israelis mention various possibilities for a West Bank settlement : the " partition " idea floated last week by Dayan and temporary " joint trusteeship " ( with Israeli security control ) are two possibilities . An Israeli-Jordanian accord for the West Bank fell apart in 1.969 ? each side blames the other for backing out ? but this time there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . At the moment , PLO prestige is at a low ebb . A failure to reach agreement might allow time for radical nationalist groups to stage a comeback . Begin 's purpose in requesting a meeting with Carter was to align the two nations ' step-by-circle policies and to show the world that Israel thinks the US still has a big role to play in the Middle East . The Israelis reportedly want the United States to impose a " Pax Americana " on the region , supporting and guaranteeing a " winners ' coalition " consisting of Israel , Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia . The left-out " losers " would be the Soviet Union , the rejection front , the PLO and Syria . The United States and Israel differ on the proper role Syria 's Assad should play . Carter was reportedly impressed by Assad when they met in Geneva this May . Brzezinski has said that Syria played a " restrained " role at the confab of anti-Sadat Arabs in Tripoli , Libya . Administration officials point out that Syria tacitly accepts Israel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate at Geneva . Israel , on the other hand , regards Syria 's regime as a Soviet puppet and an opponent of peace . In what seems an air of riding very high , the Israelis apparently are unwilling to negotiate with Syria unless it changes its government . With the Arabs splitting apart , the Israelis apparently see no need to contemplate giving back the Golan Heights in order to get a settlement on other fronts . Last January , the Ford administration went out of office and Carter came in predicting 1977 would be the year of peace in the Middle East . Lo and behold , it has turned out that way , but not as anyone foresaw . The Arabs wanted to use the United States to muscle Israel . The Carter administration thought a " crunch " would be necessary with Israel . Israel , in response , elected as prime minister its toughest , most uncompromising hawk , and he seems on the verge of producing a peace that no dove could have .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
