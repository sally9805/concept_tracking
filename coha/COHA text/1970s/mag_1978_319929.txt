For TIME correspondents covering the election across the country last week , the campaigns and the moments of victory or defeat produced some vivid impressions that will stay fresh years from now when they look back on Nov. 7 , 1978 . Midwest Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate , for example , followed Illinois Senator Charles Percy throughout his come-from-behind re-election battle , and witnessed an extraordinary victory speech . Reports Cate : " Wan and misty-eyed , Percy could not control the trembling of his hands as he read his statement . The tough race had humbled a normally proud man . " After Philadelphians defeated a proposal that would have allowed Mayor Frank Rizzo to seek a third term , New York Correspondent Robert Parker visited the headquarters of the victors and watched " snake dances with revelers flashing signs , DING DONG , THE WITCH IS DEAD . " At Governor Jerry Brown 's re-election party in Los Angeles , Correspondent Joe Kane observed while celebrants , dressed in costumes ranging from knickers to gold lam , absorbed mariachi music . " To top it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in full native costume , including six rings . He easily fit into this curious , Bruegelian scene . " <P> Perhaps the correspondents ' most pleasant memories of the 1978 election are held by two men with greatly dissimilar experience . Senior Correspondent Jim Bell , who rode the Wendell Willkie presidential train in 1940 , believes this year 's Senate race in Massachusetts between Edward Brooke and Paul Tsongas was the fairest and most honorable campaign he has ever seen . " The two candidates , " says Bell , " ended up the way they started : gentlemen . " <P> Jeff Melvoin , covering his first campaign for TIME , recalls the sight of G. Carlton Snowe helping his daughter-in-law Olympia Snowe win a seat in Congress from Maine . Reports Melvoin : " A big , broad man with an easy outdoor manner , ' Carlie ' greeted his neighbors as they came to vote . As I drove away in the bleak New England afternoon , his white hair made him easy to pick out : a large figure bundled up against the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going the last mile for his daughter-in-law .
