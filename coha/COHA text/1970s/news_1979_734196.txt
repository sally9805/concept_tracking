txt In announcing agreement on the essentials of a new SALT pact , the Carter administration is making only modest claims for what the agreement will do either for arms control or for US-Soviet relations . Administration officials seem determined to avoid raising the sort of unrealistic expectations that arose after the signing of the first SALT agreement in 1972 . Officials view this cautious approach as not only realistic but also as a way of : ? Guarding against dangerous disillusionment and swings of emotion in the US-Soviet relationship . ? Getting the American public and Congress used to the idea that the new SALT agreement is only one important part of an ongoing , complex relationship . The SALT pact is sometimes referred to as the " centerpiece , " " cornerstone , " or " central pillar " of the US-Soviet relationship , but officials say this in full knowledge that much of the rest of the structure consists of weak planks and thin scaffolding . Without the centerpiece , however , they argue that the whole // From page 1 SALT 's impact edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to build on . The argument is further made that without SALT , the US and USSR would turn to an accelerated arms race , even more defense spending , and a cold war-like relationship of such uncertainty that every confrontation would take on greatly added risk . " We are not announcing the millennium or any new era , " said a senior State Department official after the administration disclosed May 9 that agreement had been reached with the Soviets on the basic points of a new pact limiting nuclear weapons . " What we are saying is that without SALT we could get into a situation with the Soviets that would rapidly heat up , " he said . " SALT does n't hurt us , and it can help us . " The administration hopes the new agreement not only will maintain a stable " rough equivalence " in the nuclear weapons arsenals of the two sides but will also lay the foundation for an improved political relationship with the Soviets . But officials admit they have no guarantee that this will be the case . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to continue if not intensify . And they declare openly they do not trust the Soviets and that because of that lack of trust they will have to rely on satellites and other means to verify Soviet compliance with the SALT agreement . More public debate Secretary Cyrus Vance 's announcement of agreement on the essentials of the treaty is likely to intensify the public debate that is already under way over Senate ratification of the SALT treaty . With a two-thirds vote required from the Senate for ratification , the administration faces a tough fight . But congressional sources say as many as 60 out of a total of 100 senators still consider themselves insufficiently informed on the issues to commit themselves pro or con . State Department officials argue that once the entire treaty is made public ? and that could come three weeks from now when the technical experts finish their work on treaty language ? the prospects for ratification will improve . The treaty consists of 90 pages of highly detailed , finely tuned provisions limiting strategic missiles and bombers . The negotiations took nearly seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently by Sen. Robert Dole ( R ) of Kansas , long considered an anti-SALT hard-liner . Senator Dole told reporters at a breakfast meeting May 7 that Republican presidential candidates who have reservations about the treaty must be careful , because a big majority of the American people want an arms agreement . He said , " Anyone who tries to ride flat-out opposition to SALT into the White House will have the plank pulled out from under them . " No vote till fall Senate sources say hearings on SALT are likely to continue through the summer . No vote is expected until after Labor Day . Few senators are expected to vote either " yes " or ' no " to the treaty , but a number are considering proposals for amendments or reservations . One such proposal would be to require the President to go to Congress before extending any of the provisions limiting certain weapons that are included in the protocol to the treaty , which expires at the end of 1981 . Others might involve substantive changes in the treaty it- self . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Concern over the treaty in the Senate centers on the four or five issues , including ( 1 ) verification of Soviet compliance , ( 2 ) possible restrictions on US mobile , land-based missiles , ( 3 ) an alleged lack of sufficient restrictions on the Soviets ' " Backfire " bomber , and ( 4 ) opposition to SALT based on Soviet actions in other realms . Critics ' argument Critics contend the treaty will lock the United States into a position of strategic " inferiority " and possibly lull the American people into complacency concerning Soviet actions . Some argue that SALT will allow the Soviets to make almost automatic political gains because of a perception that they are gaining superiority . The essential elements of the new agreement have been known for some time . The treaty will extend through 1985 . Each side will be allowed a total of 2,250 nuclear delivery vehicles . Only 820 of those are to be launchers with land-based missiles carrying multiple warheads .
