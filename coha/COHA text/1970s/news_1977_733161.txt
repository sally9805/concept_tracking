txt Letters How Japan Views Our Role in Peking and Taiwan To the Editor . Secretary of State Vance is going to China in August to advance normalization of relations with Peking . Five years ago , the Japanese Government opened full diplomatic relations with Peking , severing formal ties with Taiwan while continuing to maintain economic and cultural relations . Some American politicians and scholars have urged the Carter Administration to take similar measures . There are , however , several fundamental aspects involved in American recognition which the Japanese recognition did not have . These are the causes of deep concern to the free Asian peoples . First , the American measures are tantamount to reducing the status of Taiwan , a de facto free independent land of 16 million people , to one of the provinces of a Communist country which totally disregards human rights . As the result , millions of Taiwanese will desperately flee their homeland to the United States and Japan to seek freedom . Secondly , the U.S. abrogation of the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and the pullout of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter 's pledge to strengthen NATO , will badly shatter the free Asian peoples ' confidence in the United States . The Japanese will be To the Editor : The New York State Consumer Protection Board disagrees wholeheartedly with the letter of Ally 6 from James A. Ackley , an officer of the New York Telephone Company , regarding the appropriateness of the State Assembly 's recent action to freeze the charge for a local coin phone call at 10 cents . The cosponsors of this legislation , which has substantial bipartisan support , believe the Legislature should act because the maintenance of the 10-cent charge is primarily a social issue regarding public access and , secondarily , an economic issue relevant only to rate proceedings . It is precisely because the Public Service Commission has consumed many months debating this matter , at taxpayers ' expense , that the sponsors of the bill wish to end this waste of public funds by putting the question to rest . Until the Legislature establishes the 10-cent ceiling , the phone company will continue to waste taxpayer funds by requesting , year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the first source of help to reach the scene of health emergencies at home or on the street . Many of these incidents are crisis situations where the need to restore breathing in the stricken person is the critical factor . As the proportion of the elderly in our population continues to grow , such occurrences , common as they already are , will become even more frequent . I recently witnessed one such case in a bank where mouth-to-mouth breathing efforts by the police were unavailing . I wondered then why a portable oxygen tank is not part of the standard equipment of every patrol car . Simple to use , this appliance would be incomparably more effective in sustaining life than desperate last-resort measures at resuscitation . Should not large public places be similarly equipped ? The survival dividend would repay the investment many times over . JULIUS RASKIN New York , June 30 , 1977 To the Editor : Drs . Rogers and Blendon may be " feeling fine " ( Op-Ed June 27 ) about the progress of health care in this country , but growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to physicians ' services . We are now spending more for health care than for all defense purposes , including even the B-1 bomber . The inner cities , rural America and U.S. armed services all have severe doctor shortages . Hospitals are engaged in a medical arms race while , just beyond the hospitals ' curbstones , a population which is growing older can not get the basic home-care services it needs to remain out of cruddy but expensive nursing homes . The average American works one hour each day just to meet the costs of private health insurance policies , which do not pay for physician office visits . The visit often must be scheduled well in advance , and the patient discovers why they call it a " waiting room . " The health care system stresses sickness not health . We need preventive services along with rehabilitation . However , people ca n't afford to pay for the services and insurance companies have not shown much interest in paying for them either , Expenses for administration of private health insurance increased 23 percent last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered by all forms of insurance . Only 13 percent of benefits were for ambulatory care ; all the rest were associated with hospitalization . There are no statistics so bad that some analysts wo n't use them . A good haunted by the idea that the next country adversely affected will be theirs . As a result , the pro-American Fukuda Government may face an even more uncertain future and opposition parties led by the anti-American Japan Socialist Party may take over . Then the following could happen ? Japan could make an accommodation with either the Soviets or the Chinese in order to lessen the Communist threat . Another option is to go nuclear . The Japanese are firmly committed to non-proliferation of atomic weapons . However , when their faith in the United States is crushed , they will be obliged to- have their own atomic weapons to defend themselves . - Nonproliferation can not be realized by signing a treaty , crying out for it , or trying to impose it upon other countries . What is important is to maintain an international situation which does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the majority of the people on Taiwan are reportedly for independence in some form , the United States should give the chance of selfdetermination to them . If the Administration took the measures of recognizing Peking under the present circumstances , the chance will forever be denied the Taiwanese . Lastly , from the point of view of respecting human rights , it should be year , that the P.S.C , double the cost of a pay call . Furthermore , we believe that the telephone company has not demonstrated a need for increased revenues ; it reported profits of $435 million last year and has received more than $1.2 billion in rate increases from the P.S.C. since 1970 . ROSEMARY S. POOLER Executive Director State Consumer Protection Board New York , July 6 , 1977 Punk Rock To the Editor : In his column of June 30 William Safire comments on the phenomenon of " punk rock . " When trying to determine the origin and significance of the word " punk " as applied to persons , Mr. Safire , after mentioning Professor Eric Partridge 's speculation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the American , rather than the earlier British , use of the word ) , says that " Punk ... began as a slang term for a catamite . " With all due respect to Mr. Safire , the Oxford English Dic tionary lists the slang term " punk " as applied to a person , as dating from the Elizabethan era ( it was used by Lodge , 1596 , and Shakespeare c. 1603 ) and as referring to a female prostitute of the lowest kind : a use which antedated its application to a male . It seems to this reader that the term has a kind of androgynous nastiness wholly proper to " punk rock . " ' Asst . Prof. ) VERONICA M. S. KENNEDY English , St. John 's University Jamaica , N.Y. , June 30 , 1977 example of this is the statistic that " in 1970 , black Americans saw physicians 12.5 percent less often than did white Americans .

FINE Washington , June 29 , 1977 The writer is executive director of the Committee for National Health Insurance . noted that a democratic country like the Republic of China on Taiwan and a Communist country are essentially different . The government of a democratic country often limits people 's freedom when it feels that peace and security are threatened . When the threats are removed , it usually restores full freedom . On the other hand , Communist governments offer'no hope of freedom and human rights . When the Carter Administration takes measures which affect the status of Taiwan , these important aspects should be carefully considered . KIYOSHI NASD New York , July 5 , 1977 The Answer to Grand Jury Abuse ' To the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Critics have ignored its fundamental strength to criticize it for failing to perform a task long since taken up by other bodies . Its historic role of protecting the innocent from oppression has been largely supplanted by procedural safeguards at the trial level created by several decades of Supreme Court decisions . The real significance of the modern Grand July is its investigative subpoena . The Grant ' Jury has one indispensable power generally denied to both police and prosecutors  --  the power to subpoena witnesses and compel testimony for investigations . This subpoena power is increasingly important for the successful prosecution of complex cases involving organized crime and massive frauds . The proposals by Representative Joshua Eilberg to separate the Grand Jury from the prosecutor are naive , especially coming from a former prosecutor . Displacing the prosecutor with a separate staff answerable to the Grand Jury will only create yet another source for potential abuse . It would also complicate Grand Jury investigations to the point of rendering them ineffective . The answer to Grand Jury abuse is not new institutions , but more accountability . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eilberg 's proposals include one simple and little-noticed reform that will encourage accountability ? a requirement that all Grand Jury proceedings be transcribed and available for judicial review . At present , Federal prosecutors are not required to make a written transcript of Grand Jury proceedings . Therefore , prosecutors are potentially free to engage in excesses behind closed doors without fear of effective judicial review . The written transcript procedure is presently the law in Arizona and several other states . In our experience the transcript requirement and the corresponding potential for judicial review constitute an effective deterrent to prosecutor misconduct . BRUCE E. BABBITT Attorney General , Arizona Phoenix , June 30 , 1977 To End Prison Cages To the Editor : After reading in The Times of the recent fires and deaths of more than 60 persons in prisons in Tennessee and Nova Scotia , and simultaneously of Lompoc Federal Prison , where there are no bars , armed guards or uniforms and where prisoners such as H. R. Haldeman paint , sketch and play tennis , I find the contrast overwhelming . Has n't the time come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1973 policy position of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency ? Ali article by Caroline K. Simon in the American Bar Associa- ' tion Journal and the New York State Bar Journal for June 1977 makes the point eloquently . She concludes : " The prison has played its part in the past . It was a great improvement over branding , maiming and hanging . . . It is high time we replace the cage as the appropriate penalty and utilize instead practices at least as effective , more economical , and far more in keeping with a humanistic society . " Human rights should begin here . RICHARD A. WEINMANN New York , June 30 , 1977 The Times welcomes letters from readers .
