ALLY , HOURLY , since first waking on my Elysian couch , I reviewed those murals , wondrous , as faithful to my story and its several characters as if no chiseling sculptor , but Medusa herself , had rendered into veined Parian , from her perch in the great sixth panel , our flesh and blood .

Despite two small departures on the heavenly sculptor 's part from classic realism ( though I grant it was a moment far from aphrodisiac , he had , I 'm certain , undersized my phallus ; and Medusa 's face , unaccountably , was but for the herpettne volt-fore a lovely WiMi 'd n ' s1. ) , it was a masterpiece among masterpieces , that panel : it it was my eye first fell on when I woke ; it it was I was still transfixed by murhwhile later when my radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at my bedside as if before an altar .

All my life I 've worshipped you , right along with Ammon and Sabazius . You ca n't imagine what it means to me to see and speak to you like this . " III I frowned , but touched her cropped dark hair and attempted to recall the circumstances of my death . Calyxa , eyes closed , made puss-eat noises .

" " It 's heaven , " she replied , brow to my hip . I 'd never heard , from Athene or the several accounts of fellowteroes which I 'd studied in the past decade , of erections in Ely sium , whereas the Olympians seemed as permanently tumesced as : he mount they dwelt on : I was elevated , then ! Still stroking as I tonsidered this rise my nice nymph 's nape , I noticed that while the mural began at may bedpost. the spiral it described did not , but curved on in and upward in a golden coil upon the ceiling to a point just above where my head would be if I moved one heads-width left ; when I raised me up to watch whither hot Calyxa now , 1 saw the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of miracles ! ? when the sprite sprang nimbly aspread that nether spiral and drew to her tanned taut tummy dazzled me , I perceived that her very navel , rather than biloholar or ipladrantie like the two others I best knew , was itself spiriferate , replicating the infinite inward wind both above and below the finite flesh on which my tongue now feasted . ? Godhood was okay . However , I was twice disturbed to find myself impotent : twice in that , one , I twice tried Calyxa then and there , that " afternoon " ( I 'd not supposed the sun set on us immortals ) , and despite or owing to her own uncommon expertise was twice unmanned ; two , it was the second time in as many weeks and women ( so it came back to true the serried time ) i had thus flopped , after never once failing done Andromeda in seven thousand nights  --  an alarming prospect for the nymphed eternity ahead . " It does n't matter , " insisted sweet-sweat Calyxa , several times in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being with you I love , Perseus ; it really is one of my dreams conic true . " There was another thing : used as I was , as king and mythic hero , to a fair measure of respect , admiration , love , I was unused to reverence : l could not make water without may votary 's adoring view ( I had not known gods pissed like mortals ) ; she literally licked clean Me plates she fed rue back to strength from ( not ambrosia after all , but dates , roast lamb , and retsina , as at home ) ( I insisted she wash them after ) ; licked me clean too , like a cozy cat , in lieu of bathing , and toweled me with her hair ( too shod for the job ) : sport enough when one was in the sportive mood , as Calyxa seemed more or less continously to be ; a mere embarrassment when one was not . Truly I believe she would have reliquaried my stools if I 'd allowed her ( I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , " she chided when I swore at that second slump . 1 supposed to her , not unbitterly , that nymphs like herself were accustomed to a rounder rogering from the deities they attended . and made clear , perhaps overprotested , that I myself was unused entirely to impotence , could not account for " Oh , you 'll be heavenly mire you 're aroused . I ran see that , " she soothed . Not her fault at all , I assured her ; indeed , never since my first nights with Andromeda , so long years past , had I couched so lively , lean , and tight a miss ; moreover , Andromeda and I , I fondly recollected , had begun as equal amateurs and learned love 's lore together , whereas Calyxa 's skill bespoke much prior experience .. . She laughed around the limb she gaily lipped and enjoined me from pout . " Believe it or not , I was a virgin till twenty-two . " Cheerfully she acknowledged then that all her girlhood she 'd so adored myself , Sabazius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so preoccupied with sports and studies , she 'd let no ordinary mortal know her ( I 'd not heard mortals could lay hands un nymphs ) ; then one evening , as she was sweeping out the sheep-god 's shrine , which she ministered along with mine and Beer-Boy 's , Amnion himself had appeared and to her great delight had rammed her . Thua initiate , she 'd gladly become not merely Lender of our three temples but priestess-prostitute as well , holily giving herself , in the honorable tradition of her earthly cite tort-parts , to the truest of our male admirers between toppings by two-thirds of the deities themselves . " Sabazius too ! " I protested . Ammon I could he purely jealous of , despite my old grievance concerning his advice to Cassiopeia , for the images I 'd seen of him in Joppa showed a fine-fettled fellow with handsome ramshorns coiling from his swarthy curls . But not only had Sabazius fermented no end of trouble for me back in Argos ; 1 winced to picture that old priapist a-puff on my neat nymph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But do n't make so much of it , Perseus ! " Along with swimming and foot-racing , she candidly admitted , she liked few pleasures more than the chains of orgasms Ammon and one or two of her mortal partners could set her catenating . She and Sabazius , on the other hand , made du with beery conversations , burps , and blow-jobs , which , the first being long and friendly , the last short and sweet , pleased her in their way quite as well as Ammon 's frisk fierce fucks . " You worry too much , " she told me on the second night , when , flaccid once again , I 'd advised her vexedly to forsake me and revert to Arnmonism . " In the first place , I 've never stopped being an Ammonite and never will  --  or a Sabazian , either , even though neither of them keeps in touch with me anymore .

Besides , was I really so naive as to equate lovemaking , like a callow lad , with mere prolonged penetration ? Yes , " I 'm a hero ! " I indicated with a sweep my relieved glories , whose first extension she had revealed to me that day . " Virtuoso performance is my line of work ! " She removed my dexter hand , it being an article of her creed , even with deities , to allow no sheepish , merely dutiful " The more you think of sex as a performance , " she advised me , " the more you 'll suffer stage fright on your opening nights . Just hug up close , now , and fill me in on what I showed you today . " IGH , I Din , curled up behind my wise cute tutor as the temple 's great second whorl , to which she 'd noonly introduced me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fancy . the Perseid reliefs and my altered view were not coterminous there where I sat regnant with Andromeda ; a second series  --  correspondent to the First in relative proportions , but of grander breadth to fit the scale of their enormous revolution  --  commenced just after , at the pillar on that farther wall aligned quite with my left-foot bedpost and Calyxa 's navel-point . " You saw how it was , " I said : " The kids were grown and restless ; Andromeda and I had become different people ; our marriage was on the rocks . The kingdom took care of itself ; my fame was sure enough  --  but I 'd lost my shine with my golden locks ; twenty years it was since I 'd headed Medusa : I was twenty kilos overweight and bored stiff . With half a life to go , I felt fettered and coffered as ever by Danai 's womb , the brass-bound chest . Polydectes 's tasks . In fact  --  please keep your face straight  --  I became convinced 1 was petrifying , and asked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radiation from Medusa .

But harebums ca n't hold a candle to nionstermachy : I stayed up too late , drank too many , traded shamelessly on my authority to bore each night a captive audience with the story of my life . ' Change of scene , then , ' my doctor ordered : ' bit of a sea-trip , do you oodles . ' He even winked : ' Take the Miss-us along : second honeymoon , et cetera . ' Well , I proposed it , and Andromeda said sure right off : park the kids in Argos , sail down to Joppa for a visit with her folks ; twenty years since she 'd seen Cepheus and Cassiopeia .

" Please do n't stop , " she pled , and taking her to mean , despite her policy , the idle handiwork that went with my recital , I resumed . " So , it was a battle from the outset , even though I 'd dropped Styxnymplisville , Hyperborea , and Hesperia from my itinerary to give us an extra week in Joppa and time for a quick look-see at Theasalian Larissa . ' Joppa period , ' Andromeda said . " .1 think she was being unreasonable , " said Calyxa . I cleared my throat . ? Well , now , perhaps it was a bit vain of me to want to retrace my good young days ; but it was n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that way I 'd lost something , look a wrong turn , forgot some knack , I do n't know ; it seemed to ore that if I kept going over it carefully enough I might see the pattern , find the key . " " A little up and to your left , " Calyxa whispered . But I was lost now in my story . " Ever since that run-in with your pal Sabazius , " I said , " things had n't been the same between Andromeda and me . " I told her how the bellied beer-god , using his Dionysian alias , had come bingeing from Naxos Mtn Argos with his new wife Ariadne- " He told me about her , last time I saw him , " Calyxa confessed . " At first I was mad with jealousy , but he was so happy , and she was sweet . . . " " Everybody was mad , " I said : " the older women especially , drink drink drink , and when I tried to close the bars lie talked them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've held out a while  --  you 've got to draw the line somewhere  --  but Andromeda claimed it was his fame I could n't abide .. . " Truth was . I declared , I did envy the upstart god his enthusiasts , the more as my own glory had not increased since Id given up heroism for the orderly administration of Argolis ; on the other hand , though not a prude . mind . I quite believed in order , measure , self-discipline , and was opposed on principle to indiscriminate housewife orgy , not to mention pedophage . I was no less than Sabazius a son of Zeus , and if no god , I had the vita of a gold-haired hard-tasked hero , whereas Sabazius did nothing but booze and ball all day .. . " Better say ' guzzle and go down , ' " Calyxa said comfortably . She too , she added , had no taste for orgies unless among especially valued friends  --  such as , say , Ammon , Sabazius. and me  --  her general policy being to offer herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her esteem for them . Nevertheless she ' i gone along with group-grope , gang-bang , daisy-chain , and oth perversions for her plump pal 's sake , deferring her preferences to his  --  just as . with Ammon , she smoked hemp and humped hind-to , although left to herself , so to speak , she 'd choose light palm-wine and Position One more often than not . in both instances , her pleasure in theirs not only gratified her beyond her own preferences but made distinctly pleasurable . just in those circumstances , the acts thernselve.s . In short , she was by no means blind to Sahazius 's shortcomings , but they were without effect on her worship of him . " We really used to talk , he and I. " ' 7 liked Sabazius okay too , " I admitted , " despite the trouble he 'd caused me ; once I 'd agreed to build him a temple to keep the housewives happy , we drained many a goblet together before he moved on . But there was no peace after that with Andromeda : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to curry favor on Olympus : was I pandering to public opinion , yielding to the pedo ? phagic protest groups , or kicking over my traces like a foolish forty-year-old ? Fame and kingship had changed me , changed me. she declared , and not for the better , et cetera . " It was all downward after that , " I concluded : " squalls and squabbles ; flirtations , accusations : relovings and relapses , let 's not relive it , you know the story , it 's all in that pillar between the last panel yonder , " where Andromeda and I shared our loyeseat throne ringed by Mile prineelets , " and the one today , " in which my scold-faced queen sat throned far right and sullen I far left , our grownlings wondering between and a ship making ready in the marble foreground .

" my priestess sighed . " You 're like some of the holiday tourists we get : bold as brass back home but all tinsel and tiptoe here . " When I had been Perseus proper , I told her then , I 'd flown the known world over , Hyperborea to Hesperia , yet never heard of tourists to the country of the gods .

" I apologized for my apology , attributing my too-tameness to ong years of Andromeda 's house-training , and that in turn to her ather 's domination by Cassiopeia , while at the same lime ad-milting that , as Andromeda herself had charged in the Sabazius affair , a better man would in the first place never " Stop that ! " Calyxa cried . T did , began lo apologize , stopped that , reflected a moment . and then declared her under no obligation to attend me if she found my manner , mind , or manliness disappointing ; but if she chose to stay she must accept me on my terms  --  which for better or worse included ( unlike Sabazius 's or Ammon 's , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No drachma but had its other side : Andromeda in Inv opinion had near henpecked me out of cockhood ; but I had learned from her what few men knew , fewer heroes , and no gods : that a a person in her independent right , to he respected therefor by the goldenest hero in heaven .

Dill everythilig Ihal saw Medusa turn to stone , or everything Medusa saw ? If the former , how explain the sightless seaweed ? If the latter , how came it to work when she 'd been beheaded ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear-view approaches to Medusa and Cetus , the far-darting Hermean sandals , even the trajectory of the discus that killed Acrisius , would it be fair to generalize that ; lodge and indirection were my conscious tactics , and , if so , were they charac ? terological or by Athenian directive ? 0 , Calyxa , this nameless girl , she had no end of insightful questions ! Which I pondered and reponderad as I 've done these murals , to find if I could their meaning , where they pointed , what it was I 'd lost . One question alone  --  whether I felt my post-Medusan years an example of or an exception to the archetypal pattern for heroic adventure  --  set me to years of comparative study , to learn what that pattern might be and where upon it 1 currently was . Thus this endless repetition of my story : as both protagonist and author , so to speak , I thought to overtake with understanding my present paragraph , as it were , by examining my paged past , and , thus pointed , proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this endeavor was those seven ; letters , at once so worshipful and wise ; l'd 've given much to spend an evening with their author ! Hence my fury when Andromeda , herself unhinged by wrath , tore open the chest lid just off Hydra and threw them to the fish . For the first time in our life , I struck her . " Y EYES FILLED at the double memory Calvxa curled me in her way until mi salt tears filled her navel . Post-swatly , went on , I took from the chest my onb correspondence with Andromeda , lovi letters written during my youthful trip u Larissa , and posted them with the other ; in the Gulf of Argolis . Then Andromeda in a perfect tempest of outrage , fish-fed the contents of the chest shore me of my valiant past as a steering drover hillocks a bull . " I could listen all night to the way you talk , " Calyxa said . " We were so busy storming at each other , " I went on , " and thi crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the natural tempest till it struck astern like the fist of a god , as if Fa ther Zeus were counterpunching for smote Andromeda . All guar rein went by the board with mast and tiller ; we were stove in t trice , sunk and drowned  --  ail save my wife and me , who , still wres tling with the relatched ruin of my chest , were washed with it the way of its contents . Empty , it floated ; our grapple became a grip the storm passed , the sharks were patient ; two days the current ! easter us , as in your picture , clutched and quarreling in the Sea o Candia ; on the third , as if caught in a repeating dream , we wen netted by a tine young fisherman , more the image of my golder youth than my own sons were . tie congratulated us on our sue vival , complimented Andromeda on her brined beauty , introducer himself as Danaus , Dictys ' son , and home-ported us with the res of his catch to Seriphos . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sculptor from your sister 's sketches , I was afraid you and Andromeda wert embracing over the sea chest . " Embarrassed , she acknowledged then under my amazed inter rogation that all the murals in the temple were rendered from het drawings , after careful instructions delivered her from time tr time over the years by couriers from Athene . She was not , then merely maid , minister . and mistress of her deities , their temples and devotees , but arlitil chronicler of their l-nreel-F , as well ! 1 re frained from asking whether Sabazius and Ammon were similarb shrined , but praised her artistry to the skies . " I 'm no artist , " she demurred . " Anyhow , I 'm not interested in me . " But I would not let her off so modestly ; with real appreciation kissed her from crown to sole , which flexily she enjoyed , am pressed her tell me how far the murals went  --  for while I mysel could predict , I thought , the next couple of panels , my memory o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my demise was stil obscure to me , as was the manner of my death itself . She shook her head . " Tomorrow , or the next night , maybe , tell you . if you have n't guessed . " Her tone grew graver . " What d you think the next panel will be ? " supposed it would portray the famous " sculpture-museum " a Seriphos , now the isle 's chief tourist attraction , which we foot somed  --  Andromeda , Danaus , Dictys , and 1 ? soon after , in whi because the cycled dream 's continuation . King Dictys himself wa in declining age and health , but overjoyed to review the sours awl cause of his ascendancy . Andromeda , unsalted arid refresher seemed to have lost five years and kilos in the sea ; she basked i the gallantries of her yet-younger life preserver . The famous sta ues , of course , were no sculptured likenesses at all , but the stone originals of Polydectes and his court . fixed forever in their po tures of insult and abuse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center sat the false king himself , still gloatin . t his declaration that my whole laborious adventure had been but its ruse for my riddance ; that he had never intended to bed any ait my gold-girt mother , whom presently he was starving from her anetuary with Dictys in Athene 's temple . Those had been his last airds : fascinated , 1 pointed out to my companions that his tongue ras still tipped to his teeth to make the theta of NaW ' Aiili179S , to rhose eta he would never come . " Remarkable , " young Danaus had agreed , and added with a race of tease in his own teeth-tipped tongue : " If Uncle P. was arty when you froze him , and has been lisping that same theta for wenty years , you and he must be about the same age now . " Andromeda laughed , her first . mirth in months ; then the two of sem went off at smart Danaus 's suggestion to find something less oring to look at than his petrified progenitors . Dictys and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort 's elbow , nd then went round the remaining figures , pensively summoning ames and patronymics from that glorious morning for half the ' ternoon . Returning at last to the now-cool shadow of Polydectes , e sipped from silver beakers of Hippocrene and traded troubles . " I ca n't manage the boy , " Dictys said ; " it 's because he never id a mother , and I was too busy running the government to be a toper father . " I sympathized , reflecting on my own sons ' growing rebellion , id asked who was Dictys 's queen ; at his hem and haw I dropped e subject , inferring with some satisfaction that young Danaus as illicit , He suggested we ought to interrupt their tete-a-tete ; but asked for more wine instead , and two beakers later was cooling to him my domestic problems and my conviction I was petfying . Dictys shook his head , " Just ossifying , like the rest of us. " so bad about Andromeda , he said ; he was just as pleased never have wed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sentiment withstood the years ' attrition . For the rest , as there is no help for it , he advised me to resign myself to lovelessness . d decline ; he 'd ship me off to Samos , Joppa , or wherever I shed  --  but all voyages , he reminded me , come soon or late to the inc dark port . " Better late , then , " said I , and announced to the thered company at dinner I was determined to teatime the tracement of my ancient route . If Andromeda would not retrace with me . . Her eyes flashed . " Joppa , period . " " At least consult Athene , " old Dictys implored me. " 3 will , " said I. " Where I did before , in her shrine in Samos . " " Where he learned about life from art , " Andromeda mocked " for represented in her temple murals there were all three Tgons  --  snahehaired , swinetoothed , blah blab blah . I know it by art , I 'm staving here . " Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it d , " he said , " that when you were done with Medusa last time . : terse put her back together again , with a difference : nowadays turns stone to flesh instead of vice versa : makes old folks spry dn . You and Dad should look her up . " At this impertinence there was a general pause , and general re . when I merely thanked him , level-voiced , for the report . If she : lined to go with me , I told Andromeda next day , she must de in Seriphos under Dictys 's chaperonage until my return : I aid not have her travel unescorted . She replied , she was her a woman , would as she would . Very well , I countered , remind-I her , however , that independence had its limits ; that , given our ticular tempers and past , the more she became her own nail , the less mine . ' Amen , " Andromeda said , a Joppan expression . " So I went it alone , " I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mural shows its there in the hall of statues : Danaus grinning , Andromeda and I glaring at each other , Dictys shaking his head , and Polydectes still lisping Nam 1 was mistaken , my artist informed me  --  not only about next day 's scene ( which pillared all I 'd just rehearsed ) but about the nature of parity between the sexes as well . " I know , " I sighed , mistaking her . " Andromeda was right . " " That 's not what I mean ! " Calyxa sprang to her nimble knees . " Look at me , for instance : would you call me dependent ? I go my own way , lonely or not ; that 's why I 've never married . But do n't you get the point ? " She flipped my flunked phallus . " I swear , I 'll have to draw you a picture . " Instead , she showed me one , next day : myself in conference already with the hooded woman in Athene 's temple , beneath the familiar frieze of Gorgons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " scrutinized my companion-in-relief . " The resemblance . . " " With the row it 's hard to tell , " Calyxa said ; " but if that 's Athene , then Athene 's the one who 's brought me the instructions for all these scenes over the years , and finally brought you here in person from the desert . She 's always been very polite to me , but she never explains the pictures . " " I 'll be glad to : at first I thought her a fellow suppliant ? " But Calyxa reminded me of our little rule , explication only after form We went to bed early , I did better , fairly entered her , though for less than heroical time and space ; I was chided for sighing ; she held me between her pretty legs and said : " Aphrodite 's a woman and so am 1 . Does that make me her equal ? " Andromeda 's fallacy , in her view , was an equivocation on the term equality : she , Calyxa , frankly regarded herself as superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are too . " " Do do n't flatter now ; I 'm serious . " Her dark eyes were , past doubt ; I 'd have moved off-top , to beside her , better to manifest our parity . but she had extraordinary grip . " I mean , they 're mortals , and you 're a nymph , " I said limply . " Never mind that . " The point was , she asserted , it went without saying , in her opinion , that to say men and women were equal was to say nothing . She herself admired excellence wherever she found it : she was far from servile by nature , knew herself to he uncommonly intelligent , witty , healthy , athletic , articulate , brave , and a few other adjectives " Pretty , " I suggested . " Sexually adroit . . . " She stopped my mouth . " But I happen to know men and women quite superior to me in all these things , and not only would n't I dream of calling myself their equal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You reminded me once that you 're a mythic hero , but you keep forgetting it yourself . Were you always psychosexually weak , or is that A ndrunieda 's doing ? " Truly I wished to withdraw , and being at least her muscular match , managed to . She grinned and bussed my forearm . " No man 's a mythic hero to his wife , " I said . But Calyxa took spirited issue : no woman remained a dream of nymphhood to her husband , either , she daresaid , but real excellence in any particular should be excellent even qualified by comparison , long familiarity , and nonexcellenee in other particulars . That permanent relationship was fatal to passion was perhaps inevitable , and as she pre . ferred to love passionately she would never marry ; het having been more than once abused by those she loved , she knew for a fad. that her admiration of their excellences was invulnerable . " Ammon 's a real bastard , often as not , " she said ; " but I 'd die for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's great . What does Andromeda think she is ? " I 'd hear no more such criticism . " My question to Athcne , " I said , " was who was I ? I made proper sacrifices , prayed she 'd appear and counsel me how not to turn to stone . if there was a new Medusa , let a new Perseus be resickled , - shielded , - sandaled , and the rest , to reglorify himself by rebeheading her . It was n't Mother Danae wanted rescuing now , but Danae 's son . " ALYXA SNUGGED against me with a kind of fond exasperation . I went on to recount how , as I 'd recounted to Athene my apprehensions , a hooded young woman had appeared beside me at the altar , whom I took to he a fellow suppliant until from the corner of mv- eyes 1 saw a radiance from hers  --  which , however , like all her features. , were cowled from view in the temple dusk . And when she said to me , " Your brother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice as no mortal 's : Athene had come to me , as was her wont , in suppliant 's guise . I reminded her I had no mortal kin , only scores of divine half-siblings like herself , got by Zeus upon his scores of bet:In-Imes . She touched my arm and softly undeceived me . " Dictys and Danae were closeted a long while in the Seriphos temple before you rescued them . But think again , Perseus , what Polydeetes was saying ; it was n't the theta of Na ( lie ABlives , but the sigma of Nat ) AltpoSCrijs . He really did lisp , and your mother 's shelter was Love , not Wisdom - . " ht short , she said , young Damns my rescuer and fait-rem rival was half my brother ! And fortunate it was  --  she went on at once , to check my flabbergasted ire  --  King Dictys and my mother had chosen Aphrodite 's shrine instead of Athene 's for their besieged amour , since Athene would have sorely punished them for sacrilege . Such exactly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been innocent Medusa 's original sin : was I aware of the circumstances of her Gorgon icing ? surrendered . " Me too , " Calyxa said . She 'd been a pretty young girl , went on the cowled apparition : a daughter of the sca.god Phorcys and thus kid sister to the grim Gray Ladies and cousin to the pretty Nereids . She 'd been well brought up by her mother Ceto , was in fact as proper a sea-nymph as ever swam : discreet of her person , pretty as the April moon , a regular churchgoer and comforter of the drowned . Her only fai ? ing , if it could he so called , was a maiden 's pride and interest in her budded beauty  --  in particular her naturally wavy hair , proof against sea salt and so comely withal that it fired the passions of the admiralty-god himself , her Uncle Poseidon " Uncles , I swear . " Calyxa said . " That 's three in this story . And two hair  --  things . I 'm glad I 'm a crew-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , to sacrifice to Athene , " Athene went on , oddly referring to herself in the third person , " and catching sight of her reflection in the goddess 's shield , left off her obsequies for a moment to pin up her hair . Next thing she knew , there was a smell of seaweed ; wet lips pressed to her neck-nape , and Poseidon put her under . Shocked Athene turned away , Medusa did too , but my , her eyes were fastened on the shield 's reflection : as the blue  --  eyed scallop resists the greedy star , but at length is pried and gobbled , so she saw herself shucked and forked by the mussled god . When he was done 511c redid through her tears her hair , to look more becomingly ravished . and called on Athene to avenge her . But that goddess , in her wisdom , punished the victim for the crime . Me  --  Medusa she banished to chilly Hyperborea with her sisters , whom she 'd cursed into snakehaired frights ; the very sight of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approached her . It was a perfectly dreadful time . " " Just a minute , " I interrupted . " I 'm glad you did , " Calyxa said ; " I was wondering too . " " I know , " said my sister 's surrogate . " But Medusa did n't , back then . There were no mirrors , you see , in their stony cave , and her swinetoothed sisters could only grunt . After a few years of seeing her would-be boyfriends freeze in their tracks when she made eyes at them , she decided that if she was ever to have a lover she 'd have to pretend in the rave what had been no pretense in the temple : not to know he was approaching . One day the seagulls on the statues of her bouldered beaux told her that Perseus himself was winging herward , a golden dream ; she lulled her sisters to sleep with a snake-charm song she 'd learned and then feigned sleep herself . Softly he crept up behind ; her whole body glowed ; his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nape . Her eyes still closed , she turned her neck to take his kiss - . . " " 0 wow , " Calyxa said . " Do you know what I think ? " " 1 know what I felt , " said I. " But how was Ito know ? " " I wish I 'd known , " 1 said shamefaced to the hooded one , who replied , it was no matter : if she 'd known herself to be as Gorgon as her sisters , Medusa would have begged to have her head cut off . In any case , when the Perseid tasks were done and the hero 's gear returned ( except the crescent scabbard , given Perseus as a souvenir , and the Graeae 's eye , which unfortunately he 'd dropped into Lake Triton on his Libyan overflight ) , Hermes had kept the adamantine sickle , restored their tooth to the aggrieved Graeae , and forwarded the helmet , sandals , and kibisis to the Stygian Nymphs : Athene retrieved her bright shield and affixed to its boss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no New Medusa ? You said there was . " " There is , " she said . " Athene reckoned she 'd punished the girl nearly enough , so she rejoined her head to her body . revived her ! and restored her original appearance . What 's more , as a kind at compensation , she allows her some freedom of motion and took away her sculpting glance for the most part , as long as she abider by certain strict conditions . . " " Never mind those , " I said . " Can she unstone me before Fit too far gone ? " The girl hesitated . " Perhaps . Under certain very strict condi tions . " But I would none of reservations and conditions ; begged only ti be outfitted as before and directed how to head off my recappei adversary . I paced about the temple , impatient to be off ; already felt younger , more Perseus than I 'd been in a dozen years . N. good her telling me things had changed ; I was a new man : onl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade 's petrifaction it myself I 'd cut off first , then Medusa 's head to melt away another hen upstart Danaua 's , and confront Andromeda with A better Per- ? CLI t ? than had first unscarped her . " That 's really what you want ? " the hooded lady asked then , ind simultaneously later Calyxa : " That 's really what you wanted ? " I yessed both ; let there be no talk of past past capture , I was ; rowing younger by the moment in both temples , hers with anticiiation , mine with recapitulation . Very well , then , said my coiffed counselor : she 'd advise me as iefore . But the case was truly altered , and so must be both my 1-uipage and my address . From beneath her mantle she produced golden dagger the length and straightness of my phallus fairly prawn . I was dismayed , for what might never lose in love would ever win in war . " No adamantine sickle ? " " Just this , " she said . " and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . I must proceed this time with neither armor nor disguise . iihy did I imagine Hades himself no longer used the helmet of his outh , if not that not it nor any other charm could work invisility once one passed a certain point of fame ? As for the poi:hed shield , it itself was changed , aegissed with the former Goron 's former power : hence its absence from the temple , lest self4lection petrify its beholders . " Magic wallet ? " I asked , heartsunk . " That may be useful , " she said . " Not to put the New Medusa 's sad in , since you 're not to cut it off ? " " Not cut if off ! " But then I remembered and remarked that her eGorgonization made the kibisis unneeded . " All she has to do is ' ok at me , then , and I 'm twenty again ? Or is it whoever looks at ar ? I was asked that question about the old Medusa , in a letter urn a girl in Chemmis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perseus , " my adviser warned , and my hestess : " You did n't answer the question . " Nor did she , I said , except to say that the New Medusa 's probamary stipulations allowed for one special circumstance in which itrifaction night occur as of old , and one in which not only its intrary but a kind of immortality might he accomplished . As a issible safeguard against the former , I was advised to borrow tee again the kibisis , to use not as a tote bag but as a veil : Meisa herself would explain it when she came to me , " and I , " I said Calyxa , " when I come to her , in panel Six-A of your second ries . " What I asked Alliene then was how to deal this time with e Gray Ladies , who though eyeless were not blind to my former ' ategy . Or might I skip them altogether and follow my own nose the Nymphs ' sour seat ? In any case , surely I must borrow Herss 's sandals again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd die of old e before I ever reached Medusa . The woman shook her head . " Athene said to remind you she s other relatives to look after too ; that 's why she could n't speak you here in person today . She 's taken a great shine to a cousin yours named Bellerophon ? " " Never heard of him , " I said , and Calyxa : " I have ; they say he 's tat . " " Never mind him , " I told her , and the hood-girl me : " You 1 , soon enough : your sister has big plans for him . Her exact gds were : ' I 'll always have a soft spot for dear old Perseus , but do nind him he 's not the only golden hero in Greece . ' I 'm sorry . " " So am I , " said Calyxa . " I see now why it upset you about mon and Sabazius . Let me ask you one question . . . " 1i Hold on , I 'm almost dune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pegasus from the court , stroked and purred to the tty beast as to a favorite child , and set forth candidly , at times apologetically ' , Athens 's new orders and instructions . I might borrow the winged horse , but strictly on a standby basis , since Bellerophon had first priority and could call for him at any moment . I should fly directly not to Mount Atlas but to the lakeshore of Libyan Triton . There I 'd find the Graeae , helpless and cross enough to bite my head off ; but I was to introduce myself plainly , endure with patience their threats and insults , and offer to skin-dive for their long-lost eye if they 'd redirect me to the Stygian Nymphs . In general , she concluded , my mode of operation in this second enterprise must be contrary to my first 's : on the one hand direct instead of indirect  --  no circuities , circumlocutions , reflections . or ruses  --  on the other rather passive than active : beyond a certain point I must permit things to come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being bumped by Bellerophon , I protested that direct passivity was not my style . It had grown by then as dark in that temple as now in this ; I could discern my companion no more clearly than Calyxa . But a resonance in her reply  --  she observed that before the point aforementioned , initiative was mine to take  --  aroused me oddly through my new dismay and old-husband habit ; I realized not merely that I was alone in the dark with a sympathetic and perhaps attractive young woman not after all Athene  --  but also that I had n't put myself in the way of such realization for many years . Abruptly I embraced her ; Pegasus skittered ; she too was and for some reason I when she neither protested nor pushed away . Simply she stiffened ; 1 as well ; thanked her for her counsel ; prepared to unarm her with some mumble . She disarmed me with a murmur instead , how it had been long since she 'd been embraced . Impetuously then 1 ran hand under habit ; she drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom took a light gold bridle . " This is for Pegasus , " she said , " to restrain him . " Smiling she led me therewith courtward , where she turned and straightway came to me , reminding me it was n't Nati ; AcspotV-r7is we 'd been in , but Nai sternAthjutas . She would n't ancowl , for modesty , she said , but let me ground her and lift dun shift to white shoulders . It was an ample soft young body , wide-hipped and small-breasted ; the night was warm , the empty court flags also ; but I , ay , 1 was cooled by the veiled allusion to Dan-aus " And by the novelty , " Calyxa said , " and by your fear you would n't get it up for her , which of course you did n't . No need to go on about ample young body wide-hipped et cetera ; 1 get the picture . " " Excuse me . " " Do n't apologize . " " Sorry . " No more that night , Calyxa insisted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scapulae , her back 's small small , pouting 1 declare with her lean little buttocks . " No need to go on about small smalls and lean little buttocks . " Sorry , love , and good evening . I was sorry at once , reached to caress those same et erteras and remarked , not ungently I hope , that just as Perseus was not the sole gold-skinned Greek hero , and the Calyxan religion not monotheistic , so she might allow that lean small what-had-she 's were not the only you-know 's deserving admiration . She spun to me merry-faced and tear-eyed and kissed me hard enough to fetch me at last full-length into her precinct proper  --  if only for a moment , as I 'd thresheld once again my offertory . But we were pleased . " You 're getting better , " she said . " Now tell me how you know you 'll meet Medusa in Series Two , Mural F , Panel One . " I replied , I thought I had the picture , but would withhold hypotheses until next day  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87 ( using her system of enumeration ) would show my ignominious Gray-Ladying at Lake Triton . Calyxa smiled . " We 'll see . " I was ma , we did ; l fetched her couchward from the scene swiftly as Pegasus had me Lake Triton Samos and , lacking that splendid stone-horse 's Bridle of Restraint , yet again fired surely but too soon . I was right , I told her eagerly : as the mural showed , I had been wrong to wrong the Cray Ladies in despite of the cowl-girl 's counsel . But old habit had died hard : even passing over Seriphos , en route to North Africa at an altitude of forty stadia , when it had occurred to me to drop in unexpectedly and check on Andromeda. it had been my impulse I checked instead , deciding to surprise her less directly by coming back rejuvenated from Medusa . And when Pegasus touched down at Triton , I could not bring myself to tell my old victims straight out who I was . There they railed , craned , and cooted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ; I altered my voice and asked crisply , " May I be of service , ladies ? " What flap , cackle , and plop ensued ! " Pah ! " said Pemphredo ; " Perseus ! " said Enyo ; " Puncture him ! " said Dino  --  vituperating serially as they took the tooth . " Not at all , " said I , sidestepping their pecks . " Self-centered Perseus is my enemy as much as yours . I understand he dropped your cyc somewhere hereabouts ? I 'll find it for you if you 'll tell me where the Styx-Nymphs are . " Prepayment was my hope , for the lake , though shallow , was wide , and I despaired of finding in it an eye lost twenty years before . But " Pfui ! " said Pemphredo , " Fool ! " Enyo , and Dino " Find it first ! " So we ( waded off in all directions , the Graeae blindly paddling , I pondering , and Pegasus grazing back on shore . " See it ? ' asked Pemphredo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dino , " Say something , silly ! " " I see it , " I said . " But I wo n't dive for it till you tell me where the nymphs are . " Alas , I was so banking on that desperate deceit I failed to cloak my voice . " Tooth-thief ! " Pemphredo cried at once ; " Eye-dropper ! " Enyo added : and Dino , " Ditch him ! " In a jiffy they had me jettisoned ; the airwaves were my medium , not the sea- ; I sank like a stone  --  and saw clearly , just before I drowned , not my mere folly . but three eyes peering eerily from the weedy bed , whereof one  --  useless miracle ' . ? was disembodied , the very Graeae 's . Dropped from the high point of my hubris , it winked now from the depths . I clutched it , closed my own , and gave up hope , not knowing my life was to he " Continued in the next installment , " Calyxa put in . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago , " I said , " I 'd 've said I was fetched here from my drowning in Two-D , if I 'd remembered even that . But One-E reminds me that I was n't . Now answer me a question : how far do these murals go ? " For I 'd seen , belatedly , how each in the second whorl echoed its counterpart in the first , behind which it stood  --  yet no amount of examining the final panels in Series One called anything to mind from my late mortality . Calyxa , however , declined reply : I 'd slept a night on my hypothesis ; she demanded equal time . And sleep she did , or feigned to , but I could n't : like a bard composing , who reviews each night his day 's invention in order to extend it on the morrow , I studied wide-eyed in the dark my recollection of I-E ( the acquisition of my gear from the odorous nymphs ) and imagined its correspondence in next morning 's scene . E STOOD BEFORE FT gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert and deserted shore it showed . Owing to the spiral 's grand proportion , the thirteen meters of I-E were stretched to near two hundred ; yet in all that stadium but two things caught one 's eye , even mine , who had caught the Graeae 's : Pegasus , winging off to the upper left comer with Pemphredo astride his neck , grin-toothed Enyo sidesaddle , and Dino leering backward over his crupper ; and , on the lakeshore far down right , myself looking mournfully up after , a drip-dry-hooded lady by my side . " Same one as in the temple ? " Calyxa asked , " Or a Styx-Nymph ? " I wondered how to tell her . " That 's what / wondered when she rescued me , " I said . " But do n't forget our rule . " We gazed awhile longer , until Calyxa let go my hand , said flat , " It was an easy picture to draw , " and went bark inside . I sneaked one preview over my shoulder of II  --  F-1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then followed after , and found her not naveled on-center as usual . but briefed still and cross-legged on the couch , in her lap a game board . " I 'm bored by all this fucking , " she announced . " Let 's play chess . " Are you jealous , Calyxa ? " " Whatever of ? " But she mated me in no time , four games straight , declaring frankly and frequently that I made stupid moves , rooking and queening me unmercifully until I put by board and pieces , holstered her firmly by the shoulders , and ditto 'd her . Dutifully she opened , but looked away the while , none of her usual frank inspection of our coupled parts . Therefore , perhaps , I did okay , if still briefly , even eliciting a minor moan of pleasure from her toward our pleasure 's end . When we rolled , still a-clip , to rest sweating on our sides , she twirled a finger in my chest-hair and said , " I thought you said Styx-Nymphs stank . " " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ douche with every stroke . You must remember how it was with Ammon , in the Nile ? " She apologized then for sulking and merely asked whether , as she supposed , it was Medusa herself who 'd salvaged me , and in whose embrace I would be stranded in the panel to come . " That 's putting it disagreeably . " Sorry  --  my words , not hers , but we know what she meant . No point in further false suspense ; I told her it was , or turned out to p be , the one I sought . " Ali I knew at first was that she was a sea-nymph , that pair of green eyes clown with the Graeae 's gray . She must have beached and insufflated me ; when 1 came to we were mouth to mouth tinder her cowl . I could n't see a thing ; when I opened my eyes she kept them covered with her hand till she 'd moved off and veiled herself . Not a half-veil , mind , like some Joppa girls wear , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I thanked her , the reminded me I 'd flouted Athene 's orders , hence my dunking , and advised me to return the eye at once , unconditionally , to the Gray Ladies , by this time shoaled some way downshore . I did , beginning to wonder whether my lifeguard was perhaps amphibian , the same a he 'd briefed me in Athene 's temple and bridled me in her court . " " Your horse-metaphor 's ass-backward , " Calyxa said dryly . " It 's you who were in the saddle. ? I was no poet , 1 reminded her merely a man with a tale to tell . If I might get on with it ? How , introducing myself to Pemphredo as Perseus , son of Zeus , I 'd plunked the eye in her palm and pled to all three for triangulation ; how , eyed , she 'd eyed me , clapped for tooth from Dino , snarled " Nothing ! " and taken off in a trice on Pegasus with her cronies , in the direction of Mount Atlas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the hood-girl , excused myself , and waded into the lake , asking her please not to interrupt this time my drowning . No map no Styx-Nymph. no nymph no wallet , no wallet no Medusa , no Medusa no relief from ealeifaeLion . She waded behind . " Why do you want rejuvenating , Perseus ? Do you really think you 'll win back Andromeda ? " I was in deep , could n't think of a right reply . " Or is it simply to he able to do hero-work again ? " " That Ion , mainly . " " Then wait ! " She clutched me by the tunic-top , now shoulder-deep . " I wondered too , " Calyxa said . " How can Being Perseus Again be your goal . when you have to be Perseus to reach it ? " I was twice fetched up , by the cowl-maid and Caly-xa 's question , which l 'd not considered . I uncouched and considered her . " When you were mortal , Calyxa , did you write those seven letters ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so many epistolary details came crowding on me . I repeated Athene 's counsel , which the veiled one repeated to me : ' Past a certain point sit tight , hang loose , stand fast , let things come . " Do n't fret about Pegasus , she advised me : Athene had recalled him for young Bellerophon , who was ready to commence now his own career . I should camp on the beach , at least for the night ; since the Styx-girls were off the map and 1 seemed not to know where / was either , perhaps they were not far distant , might even come looking for me . Sire , al least , would return before morning to see ; why not trust my nose for news and get some shut-eye ? was sure then she was Athene 's handmaid , the same I 'd courted in Samos . I cloaked out on the shore and watched the stars wheel , not so many then as now , making stories from their silent signs and correspondences . The night was chill ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calyxa said : ? she came. ? " Right . It was a camper 's wet dream : she stole from the lake by starlight and slipped under my cloak , her own still sopping . She was all a-shiver ; I helped her off with it , up to the cowl and veil , which she 'd not remove . But I was right ; I 'd 've known that body anywhere ? " 1 7Ample soft wide-hipped small-breasted blab . " " You 're being Andromeda , " I chided Calyxa . " Sorry . " " Do n't apologize . She confessed she was the Styx-Nymph , her veil the kibisis , which she 'd as leave keep on till morning if I did n't mind . We did n't get much done . " " You said she was Stvgian , I believe ? " " Stop that . She was innocent , had had only one man before , Poseidon , he left his traces , never an orgasm . " " I had orgasms long before I ever had a man . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was sweet , sweet , my lifesaver ; I was grateful , she was impetuous and shy at once , I was flattered  --  but she was stiff with rue , out of inexperience , and I limp with her . . . " " Out of practice . " " You di I write those letters ! Anyhow , she was Athene 's aide . I reminded myself . not Aphrodite's. 1 waseager to see her face , whirl ' she promised to unveil when the time was right ; if her neck , which especially pleased me , was any indication . . . " Calyxa sat up and requested a change of subject . She was past her pout , even teasy , but would not be touched by my returneeeence , inspired as it was not altogether by herself . " We all know it was the New Medusa , " she said . " ls that why she kept the bag over her head ' ? " " Do n't be crude . " She turned sober . " I 'm afraid of tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my- Stvx-Nymph , toward dawn , had said quite the same thing , which I 'd explain in the morning . I comforted both : assured the sea-girl that I had more to fear than she , since . without Pegasus to fly nie to Hyperborean Medusa , the kibisis was useless ; endesvored in Calyxa 's case to change the subject to her Perseid letters , which could be said to be responsible for the narrative in hand , its source and omphalos . Had she died in Egyptian Chemmis  --  drowned while skindiving with Ammon in the Nile . perhaps , or been erocodiled in the deeps of love  --  and elevated posthumously ? Or was her heavenhood a kind of prize for authorship , as Dclphinus had been starred by Poseidon for his winning speeches ? Speaking of Chemmis LT SHE 'D SPEAK no more , only clung to mr most close that night as Medusa , still mantled , was shown clinging to me on the beach in the morning 's mural . WE , like its counterpart , was septuple , but so grander in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadest in ? the inner series and could he viewed only individually . I asked Calyxa whether , in Zeus 's timetable , the whole of it might he seen that day , or were we obliged to give a week to its several panellets . " Are you in such a hurry ? " " No no no , " I assured her ; " well , yes . For one thing I ca n't remember a thing after the week I spent with Medusa on Lake Triton , and I want to know exactly when and how I died . But what really interests me is the way this temple of mine is unfolding . " What I meant , I explained when we returned to bed , was that given on the one hand my rate of exposition , as it were  --  one mural per day- and on the other the much rapider time-passage between the scenes themselves , we had in six days rehearsed my life from its gold-showered incept to the nearly last thing I remembered ; it followed that soon  --  any day now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of my death and overtake my present transfiguration . What was she drawing currently , I demanded of Calyxa , if not herself and me in spirate heaven , reviewing the very murals she was drawing ? She bid me consider two things : first , that , immortality being without end , one might infer that the temple was as well , from our couch unwinding infinitely through the heavens ; on the other hand , it was to be observed that as the reliefs themselves grew longer , the time between their scenes grew shorter . Might n't it be , then , that like the inward turns of the spiral , my history would forever approach a present point but never reach it ? Either way , it seemed to her , the story might be presumed to be endless . " But it 's all exposition ? Where 's the real-time drama ? Where 's the climax ? " Calyxa smiled seriously . " I think we 'll come to it very soon . Together . " She then announced , at first augustly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Leo , was the twenty-fifth anniversary of her birth and the twentieth of another red-letter day on the calendar of her life , which she 'd tell me about tomorrow- By way of celebration , it being presently by her estimate an hour ur so from midnight , she suggested we reverse our liana order and en ? joy narration before copulation , so that she might arrive at the quarter-century mark in my arms . I was much touched  --  and troubled by another implication of her news  --  but I observed to her that the gloss on II-F-1 would he malapropos and anaphrodisiae in those circumstances , since , as she knew , that morning 's scene had represented my tryst with Medusa . Should we not just skip it ? Game of backgammon ' ? Hour 's nap ? " No . " Calyxa said positively . " I 'm okay now . I want to hear ii . " " Okay , I guess she is okay . Fm still jealous , but I wo n't be erit ? teal anymore . " Good . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the tale . I hope she 's okay now . " It was in the morning , " I told her , " Me. dusa told me she was Medusa . We 'd tried again , not a whole lot better ; she 'd drawn up hind-to to me  --  please do n't turn over  --  still wearing the kibisis alone , and bade me not turn her over till she 'd told her tale . First came the story of her life , part of which she 'd exposed to me in Samos : her pretty girlhood , Poseidon 's rape , Athene 's punishment , her ignorance of her Gorgonhood and mistaking me for her lover instead of her destroyer . " Very difficult to tell this part , especially with you listening . " Her eyes had been opened , she told me , by my sword at her neck , and her last sight had been her reflection in my shield  --  the same she 'd set her hair by in Athens 's temple . It so mortified her she was pleased to die ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revived her  --  whereupon her first request was to redie at once if she was a Gorgon still , An odd thing was that , once brought back , she could recall all her dead head 's doings , and did so with mixed feelings . To be perfectly frank , despite my having killed her she still loved me. and had lived , during her death , for those moments when I raised her by the hair and she withered my enemies with a glance . This declaration moved me ; I begged her to unbag and let me kiss the pretty head  --  she had said it was pretty ? - 11 'd so ill-used to such good effect in its former state . " But she stayed my hand with a recital of the hard conditions of Athene 's amnesty : first , should she ever again look at her reflected image , she 'd see a Gorgon , not a girl ; second , should she show her face to anyone , she 'd instantly return to Gorgonhood . " " That 's not fair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Exactly . But there was one compensation and one escape clause . Athene granted her the power to juyenate or depetrify , just once , whomever she gazed uncowled at or whoever uncowled and gazed at her ; but the conferral of this boon on the beholder must be at her own cost , since by the earlier stipulation she 'd he reGorgoned . " " Ay , " Calyxa said . " Your sister does n't give anything away free . " " She 's not the goddess of justice . I asked Medusa what the escape clause was , but for a time she would n't say . I believe I mentioned she was shy ; what I 've told here in two pages took me days to coax from her . Between confessions  --  which 1 prompted by confiding my own in tultles , at an exchange-rate of seven to one  --  we 90 strolled the beach , swain and fished , talked about life in general . " " And made love , " Calyxa said . " And tried to make love . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , had been rough on her ; you know how ' gods are . " " Yup . " " Nohody 'd ever done the forepleasures with her properly , or showed her what to do with herself . . " " I promise not to say anything critical , " Calyxa said . " I kind of like Medusa now . But I thought most of those things were instinetive . " " Nope . " " Well ... had n't she read anything ' ? You know . " " Reading was what she did most , " I replied , - especially the old myths and legends ; it was what we mainly talked about . However , as you may have noticed , myth is n't reality : it was agreeable to teach her how love is made , but her inexperience was as off-putting in its way as your expertise . What 's more , I was naturally concerned over Athene 's stipulations , as I learned them . . . " " In short , you were impotent , like with me a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole time , I hope ? I 'm on Medusa 's side now . " " Did she really say that , Perseus ? " She really dill " Just the first few nines , " I answered . " We gut a hit better each night , just like us . It turned out she was afraid I would n't want her when I learned she 'd been a Gorgon , and been raped by Poseidon , and given birth to Pegasus . " " Hear ma not saying anything ? " " But I told her , honestly , that those things did n't bother me at all . The fact was , no other way to say it in a first-person narrative , Medusa really loved me , her first experience of that emotion , and I realized I had n't been loved since the old days with Andromeda . What 's more , she truly was a kindred spirit ; we had jolly conversation , . . " " Do n't heat about the hush , " Calyxa said . " Did you love her or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagued by doubts about us both . " How could I be sure what was behind her veil ? " I answered . " And was n't it likely my attraction was mainly relief after all my troubles , cir mere vanity at being loved ? ' " What you really wanted , " Calyxa said , " was to be twenty with Andromeda again . Can we get to the escape clause ? " I was astounded by her insight . " That 's what we got to , on the - fifth night . We 'd finally had a proper lovemaking ; she 'd learned to let herself go a little , even felt her first bit of orgasm ; it was clear we 'd be all right soon enough if we kept at it , just as we 'd be ; while we clung together in the denouement , I declared I loved her and asked what Athene 's last condition was , for I wanted very much to see the face that spoke in such a gentle voice and topped such a pretty neck , excuse me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : if the man who uncowled her , and on whom she laid her one-shot grace , were her true lover , the two of them would turn ageless as the stars and be together forever . But since she had n't known herself a Gorgon before , and could n't view herself now , for all she or I could know she might be Gorgon still , and Athene 's restoration a nasty trick . In short , whoever unveiled and kissed her must do so open-eyed , prepared to risk petrifaction forever in a Gorgon'a hug . Prn willing , Perseus , ' she told me at the last , ' but you 'd better think it over . ' " Calyxa shook her head . " I ca n't remember any analogues for that motif . " " I could n't either . Next day she was quieter than usual , and that evening she told me very gently just what you said a while ago : in effect , that I loved her less than she me and was still bound with hall my heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , to hide my shame ; I swore I did love her , if anyone , as much as I could , not really knowing her and all ? " " 0 boy , Perseus . " " Yes , well . She wept a bit , near as I could tell ; I was all cut up , vet at the same time stirred ; lots of sex in this story . I touched her ; she flowed at once , most womanly ; I managed almost as well as with Andromeda . Medusa was in rapture ; I do n't say this out of vanity . . . " " I know why you say it , " Calyxa said . " But how about you , Perseus ? Were you in rapture ? I think about us , last night , on the very edge .. . " I told her , what was true in the other case as well , I was still too preoccupied to feel rapture of the kind I 'd been accustomed to with Andromeda in better days . Pleasure , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite , of the free transporting sort , nor would I likely , until we rose unfettered to the same high altitudes . " If ever . " shrugged . " In any case , Medusa came at last ; there was the moment to discover her . " " Yes . " " Yes . " Yes . " But I did n't , merely held her fast till I fell asleep . Next morning she was gone ; I woke alone . " " Perseus ? " " Yes ? " " It 's after midnight . I 'm twenty-five and scared . Will you make love to me ? " I did ; she did ; there is a surfeit of sex in the story ; no help for it ; we verged on much and did n't cross the verge . No more my merry priestess , Calyxa solemnly sat up and by the light of the altar lamp watched me drip from her to the spiraled spread . " I like my life , " she said , as if addressing the little puddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a free , independent life . I would n't be tied down to any man . You and I do n't really relate . I ca n't turn you on . We 'd probably drive each other crazy if we stayed together . You 're nut in heaven , Perseus . Neither of us is . " One finger was permitted to touch her thigh . " Chemmis ? " She nodded . " And alive , then . " " Yes . " Pause . " I wondered how it was you could have a birthday . " Pause . We both watched her flex to stop my flow from her , in vain for all her able musculature . " When you stopped here on your way to Joppa the first time , it was my fifth birthday , " she said . " They let us out of summer-kindergarten to see the gold-skinned flying hero who 'd cut off the Gorgon 's head . You only took a drink of water from the public fountain and flew off , but all through school we studied you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our native ones . " She sat cross-legged on the spermv point , her tears running too . " I could stop this if I closed my eyes and legs , " she declared , and did n't . " At first the town council put a little bronze plaque on the water fountain ; Ammon and Sabazius were the local favorites . Later on , when I thought I might like to be a scholar , I wrote a thesis on the three of you : my heroes . " She smiled , sniffed , fingered the pudlet . " In fact , that was my thesis : that since of the local heroes only Perseus was technically a hero , and a first-rank one at that , whereas the others were technically gods , but secondary ones , you were as deserving of a temple as they were . It was a stupid essay . " " I do n't know . " She shook her head . " I ca n't do scholarship . Or write or draw or anything . I 've got this great IQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in Ammon 's and Sabazius 's temples to support my studies , and then Ammon screwed me , and I liked it , so I let Sabazius in too , and pretty soon I was in charge of all three temples . It 's not bad work ; I meet a lot of people ; I just wonder sometimesit I 'm gelling anywhere that matters . The three of 11111 are mar vied ; Ammon and Sabazius have loads of other girlfriends . In a way , I guess , vou were my last hope ; when Medusa brought you here , I clitilrin.1 help wishing ? Idly she flicked semen at the lamp flame . Missed . " So it turns out even you 've got a girl already . " " Not anymore , " I said . " Not even I. " But I did , if I was alive , have a wife ( I regarded her  --  Young , naked , and lovely , chained to the cliff in I-F-3 ) , to whom I 'd better he getting back . " I 'd wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mural ? " " Just the desert , as you 'll see on your way out . But Perseus . . . " Surprisingly , for 1 thought her vexed . or self-sorrowing , or both , she slid over and put my head in her lap . " I might as well be the bastard who breaks the news : Andromeda 's left you . For keeps . " I 'd been enjoying close-up her lamplit navel . At this announcement my heart skipped as in poor poetry , and my eyes closed without my closing them . " Medusa told me when she fetched you from the desert , " Calyxa said . " Your wife 's gone on to Joppa with Danaus. " unlapped and found my missing voice . " I 'll kill him . " But Calyxa observed , calmly , that killing Danaus would change nothing ; he meant no more to Andromeda than she Calvica me : a mere diversion , a refreshment . Andromeda wanted rid of me , and that was that ; if I examined my heart , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such things happened . Was n't that the case ? I spoke with difficulty , into her stomach . " I suppose . " Now my eyes were wet as well . " Do vou love Medusa ? " " I do n't know . " Calyxa rubbed two fingertips in closing circles where gold curls formerly grew . " If you wanted to stay on here ... I mean indefinitely . . . I 'd like that . " We spent a sweet half-hour ; then she slept imperiously as a child while I tossed the night through , Baled by emotions sundry as the II-B winds . The image of Danaus abed with Andromeda one moment made me retch and sweat with rage ; the next I was euphoric with relief to be at last unchained , free to be Perseus , starred or stoned as the issue might prove , but my own man . Followed grief at the lost past , my one young-manhood ; then sympa. thy sharp as pain for my Andromeda , mine no more  --  so line and dainty in the bed still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unbearable as myself every other where . Toward dawn I went round with the guttery lamp , reviewing for the last time the first revolution of my story ; lamp oil , night . and heroic youth ran out to- gether ; I came back to Calyxa , stroked her out of dreams into drowsy liquefaction , here it comes again , climbed with her to our first full Mtn-lent . She held my face close for examination while we finished pulsing . " I was sure you 'd gone . " When I did n't answer she held fast vet a moment , blinked once , then let go all and turned her face away . " I may be back . " I said . Further : " Thanks an awful lot , Calyxa . For everything . " I might even have gone on to say , " I really mean it , " had not a throat-lump spared her that final gaucherie . A tunic , prose-purple , hung in the passage behind 1-A ; I donned it , left my priestess leaking love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast blank spaces that in time would be II-F-3 through 7 and ll-G . Not having entered my story yet , they did n't recognize its hero ; and I ( I recognized an hour later , dhowing clown the pea-green Nile ) neglected in turn to notice whether any man among them looked deserving of its artful chronicler , and my gentle , cosmic jealousy . OPPA PERIOD , " I told the boatman , who proposed a Memphis rest stop and a tour of the river 's seven mouths . Two-thirds of my tale was told , its whence and where : as to its whither , I knew only that I would once more and finally confront Andromeda : whether to kiss or kill , hello goodhyr , her whomever , I 'd know when I was II-F-3 'd . Calyxa was behind ; I assumed , more heartfelt loss . I was bereft of New Medusa too , despite her having vet again saved my life , since love and gratitude , in the clutch , had been kibisised by doubt . My scruffy boatman , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where fair Andromeda had been snacked for Cetus till mighty Perseus et cetera . She was n't fair , I corrected him . One in every boatload , he rejoined , I having paid him in advance for the night 's sea journey : had I been there , as he had ? To preserve my anonymity I let the seedy salt run on ; even when he described , in lewdest terms , my bride-to-be 's nakedness. to ogle which he claimed had been my motive for going down , 1 did n't dagger him ? only vowed to post Calyxa this further hair-thing in my history , thitherto forgot : how I 'd thought Andromeda a marble statue till the sea breeze stirred her hair . The seaman mistook my smile for smirk and reported what he said was coastwise knowledge : that that same Andromeda was currently whoring it in Joppa with a new boyfriend ; that one Galanthis , said to he Cassiopeia 's gigolo , was out to hump her as well ; that the elder queen was so smote with jealousy she 'd hecatombed Ammon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resacrifice her roundheel daughter ; that  --  but that that was the last he thatted : passivity be damned , I dirked and sharked him , dhowed to port alone . That day 1 prowled the town in hopes of reconnoiter , hooded like my desert darling  --  till I recollected her advice , near on to evening . I doffed my mantle then , went straight to the palace gate , told the dusky guard I was King Perseus , out of my way , strode into the court , where I sat on the nearest bench to let come what would . Came , from behind the hedge behind me where old Cepheus grew his greens , his antique voice , I knew it . " Good evening , good evening , I believe . I presume there 's someone there ? Eves and ears are n't what they used to be . . . " I went through the hedge . " It 's I , old man . " Much shrunk with years , Cepheus sat on the vegetable ground . not addressing me after ail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on as if I were n't beside him . " Seems to me I 've been here forever . I make a kind of circuit of our fields , I guess ; rotate like my crops ; after a while one 's much like another . Pity , that . Caught me nap ? " I tapped his shoulder . " 1 was about to say , " he said , " you caught me napping , as one night Perseus will . . . " 92 " Sir , I am Perseus ! " " Perseus ? " My eyes welled up ; his blanked on through me . But I was n't really asleep , only drowsing . Old folks do n't need much sleep ; the night ahead keeps us awake . I , I 'm always first one up , never really go to bed , prowl house and grounds the night through , napping and nibbling . 0 , I fret about the wife and kids , national debt , garden ; talk to myself , go round in circles . . . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and deaf ? " " Excuse me , " he said . I gripped his arm . " Used to be , " he said , " I 'd have a lackey do the introductions when I held an audience . No need now , I ran start the story anywhere ; it goes right along , you 'll see , hangs together like a constellation if you know the stars , how to read them . My name 's Cepheus  --  the Ethiopian king ? My wife 'll be along presently , Cassiopeia ; she 's down washing her hair , Andromeda , too , Perseus , all the rest , they 'll come by , you 'll see them . " I moved my hand before his moveless eyes . " To be king of Ethiopia , you know , it is n't easy . But 1 never was a king , only consort to a queen . Cassiopeia , her majesty , that 's the whole story ; that 's why we 're all here , for better or worse . By heaven , she is beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time  --  I forget . Andromeda ? It was your mother ! I forget . " He frowned , seemed about to clear his head . " No , I remember , I remember ! Zeus Ammon , it comes together ! " I groaned . " Where are they , Cepheus ? " " We 've always got on . Andromeda and I , despite the Wife . I wish she 'd brought the kiddies too , they 'd like the beach this time of year . Do n't forget , she 's my only child : it left a hole in the house , I tell you . when Perseus fetched her off , happy as I was to sec her saved . Just me and Cassiopeia then , in this big place . I do n't know . " Hand on dagger I made to leave ; but Cepheus held my robe for the moment it took to reinstruct myself in patience . " It is n't the separation upsets me so , " he declared . " They are n't kids anymore ; their k ids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And often as Cassiopeia and 1 have wished we 'd never met .. . Though even at the worst we 've stuck together , marriage is n't what it used to be , youngsters nowadays . Faw !

" Again he frowned beside me . " You ... you ca n't have two women in the same palace . " " I believe it . " " So do I. " Love , please . we 're a way from the epilogue . Cepheus shook his head ambiguously . " Twenty years later I 'm still in a misery over it , weeding out my chick-peas and cursing myself for a coward , to let history repeat itself . . . " " You never were a coward , Cepheus ! I-F-5 , the Battle in the Banquet Hall , remember ? " " No , by Zeus , " he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coward , just deadly henpecked , and there you are ? " " Perseus ! This is Perseus ! " " Come to a man 's fight , I always held my own . " He let me help him to his feet ; my own knees were scarcely less stiff . " I do n't excuse myself , " he said . " You can imagine how I felt when the time came , rambling in the bean hills , tapped once again , and there stands Perseus , asking me what 's Cass cooking up this time , and where 's Andromeda , and what 's she up to , as if twenty minutes had gone by instead of twenty years ! " I squeezed . " That 's what I 'm asking , Cepheus ! look at me ! " His eves were moving now , more like a frightened man 's than a blind . I laughed and slapped my gut and pate . " See ?

" He pursed a small smile , " Is Perseus still , Night air 's bad for the arthritis . Let 's go in , son . " Eyes cleared entirely , he confirmed as we limped palareward that Andromeda and young Daunts were there shacked up ; that Cassiopeia , furious at her own Galanthis 's flirtations with her daughter , was nagging him , Cepheus , again with Ammon-oracles fishy as the first ; that ( what I had n't heard before ) it was she who 'd set Phineus to disrupt my wedding , out of general jealousy . I was stopped cold . " Why do you put up with her , Cepheus ? " He fingered an earlobe : glanced at me sidewise ; declared he 'd been of ' course long since distressed that he was n't loved by the woman whose beauty he still su honored , but that he 'd never reckoned himself especially lovable , and assumed it was not for no reason that women like his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ; concluded with a shrug : " You 'll learn . " " I think not . Where 's Andromeda ? " He chinned his beard at the house ahead . " In the banquet hall , waiting to say goodbye . " By means he 'd been unable to discover , he explained ( certainly not his own intelligence department , always last to know anything , or the Royal Ethiopian Post , which moved at sea-snail pace ) , reports of my arrival had preceded me to Joppa , caused general alarm in the palace , and brought cm , he could only assume , his fearful trance . " But the reports were wrong ; they said you 'd lost ten years . " Wrong I replied was right : I 'd lost twice ten , my wife as well , and felt ten older for the loss . We reached the banquet hall , Cepheus lagging some meters behind with vague complaints : damp ground , old bones . At the threshold I paused to let my eyes accommodate to the famous scene , I-F-5 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in pools of marble blood , lay those done in before I 'd fetched Medusa out to marble all ; skewered Rhoetus , the first to die ; Athis the mind-blown catamitc pinned under Lycabas , the sickled Assyrian bugger ; Phorbas and Amphimedon shish  --  kebabed on a single spear ; granite Erytus , bonged by me to Hades with ' a sculptured drinking bowl ; the sharp-tongued head of old Emathion , unaltered on the altar as if still hurling disembodied imprecations ; Lampetides the minstrel , weddings and funerals a specialty , fingering forever on a limestone lyre the chord of his dying fall . Standing among these were those I 'd rocked in vivo : Ampyx and Theseelus , cocked to spear me ; false-mouthed Nileus ; Aconteus my too-curious ally ; and one hundred ninety-six others  --  chief among them Phineus , Andromeda 's first-betrothed , whom I 'd memorialized last in a posture of tunic-wetting terror to remind my wife how luckier she was to have me . Relocating him took some moments , in part because he was but one among so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smoothed her hair  --  the white-gowned woman standing before him , back turned meward , was not Exhibit 201 but live Andromeda . " Nuisance to keep dusted , all this , " Cepheus murmured behind me . I shushed him , not to miss the odd soliloquy my wife addressed to her uncle 's statue : " Poor Phineus . I 'm as old as you are now , and Perseus is older . The man who stoned you 's gone to seed ; I 'll soon go too ; do n't scorn your last words to him anymore . " It was the cringer 's seniority-over-merit plea she meant : that while I 'd done more to deserve her , he 'd known her longer . I considered wrath , but was touched instead by curiosity and complex jealousy : the timbre of her voice was so familiar I could not distinguish it for comparison with Medusa 's , soft and throaty , or crisp Calyxa 's ; Cepheus perhaps was right about her harried face , hut , dizzy at thought of Danaus , I remarked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told on the rest of her  --  not much less trim than what i 'd salvaged off the cliff . " Trial enough , " she went on to her skinflint uncle , " being life-partner to a Dream of Glory ; but what a bad dream I woke up to ! Thin-haired , paunchy , old before his time , dwelling in and on his past , less and less concerned with me and the family . . . " Her voice was hard-edged , a tone I winced from ; now it softened . She touched the statue 's averted cheek ; had she ever touched mine so ? " Thoughtful Phineus , gentle Phineus , weak-willed With you I 'd hare been strong - .. and would have yearned , I guess , for somebody like  --  Perseus ! " ROUGH THIS LAST she 'd wept ; my eyes stinging too , I 'd drawn my dagger and called her name across the hall . At her cry it was as if the statues came to life , or-shed live men from their dead encasements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Danaus , armed and shielded , stepped from behind Phineus ; half-a-dozen others in Seriphean garb from Astyages , Eryx , and the rest  --  and from a nearer door , a somewhat larger number of the palace guard , led by a rodent-faced young man and followed by grim-visaged Cassiopeia. " 0 my , " said Cepheus , " they 've set a trap for you , Perseus . Sorry . " I moved to stick him as he to draw his antique sword , but was diverted by a fresher threat from Danaus , who roared upon me . Happy interruption ! For Cepheus , in fact contrite , ordered the pal . ace guard to kill my ambushers , except Cassiopeia and Andromeda . For a moment all were caught in the commands and countermands : Cassiopeia called on the guards to follow Galanthis in killing the lot of us , Andromeda and Cepheus included ; Galanthis amended her directive with an order that Andromeda be spared ; at the same time Danaus exhorted them to join the Seripheans in killing me . Galanthis , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern Ethiopia by junta ; Andromeda meanwhile screamed at everyone in general to kill no one , and at me in particular that she 'd had no part in the consoiraev.Danaus 's javelin whistled over my shoulder into the ' ouch first speared by Phineus twenty years past , ending the suspension . Cepheus himself pulled it out and feebly hurled it at Galanthis ; the gigolo sidestepped , a guard behind deflected it idly with his shield , and to all 's surprise it punched into the Queen 's de:colletage . Dismayed , she sat down hard and died , drumming her heels upon the floor ; Andromeda shrieked ; Cepheus with a groan went at Galanthis , Danaus with a grin at me , the guards and Seripheans randomly at each other . Even shield-and-sworded I 'd have had hard going , for I was out of practice , short of wind , and overweight ; with A throe 's mere dagger I had no chance . Danaus therefore took time to taunt : " Not a bad lay , old boy , your wife ; plenty life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for , " I 'd felt a moment of Phincan panic at my death to come , displaced next moment by red rage . But my helplessness itself gave me a third for self-collection . As Danaus jibed on  --  calling Dana ? the mother of whoredom for having been first to spread her legs for coin , myself therefore the original whoreson and a paper drachma  --  I knew what I assumed would be my final satisfaction : that despite the Inequity ; of our arms it was partly awe that hesitated him , inspired by the Perseus whose legend he 'd cut his teeth on . My last chance to write a fit finale , however different in style , to that golden book came to me clear as Calvxa 's art : declaring ( what in another sense was true ) that I preferred an even contest , tossed away dagger and stalked him bare-handed . " Empty bravado , " Danaus scoffed , and retreated one step . There was the only victory I could hope for , for as I told him calmly above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexperience of hero-murder delayed his band . His pallor I knew was momentary ; even as 1 spoke his color returned , his sword went up ? " Ah , Andromeda ca n't say whether 1 said aloud or to my swoony self ! He is a fine lad . your lover ; a young Perseus ! " At this instant two things flew together from the free-for-all : a massive silver goblet , knocked from the altar-of-Emathion , spun to my feet ; and Andromeda dashed between us to clutch her friend 's knees . Shield ? Stay ? Embrace ? Supplication ? Frantic , Danaus pushed and shouted at her , slipped his helmet , got himself tangled and turned round . In moments fewer than diese words I snatched up the great goblet , more welcome to my hand than its prototype beside long-smashed Erytus , and while my half-brother half-wept and swore at his handsome hobble , I fetched him such a clout aside his head that the goblet gonged . As if at that hell , the fighting ceased . Danaus dropped dead . Stunned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand : of newer manufacture than the Erytus-model , its reliefs depicted the earlier donnybrook in that same hall . Further , as though Calyxa herself had drawn the day , while distraught Andromeda lovingly cupped her late lad 's head. I remarked that the wound she wept on , intaglio 'd in his temple , was the image of his bowled fore-dropper . Now she stood , my wife , wild-eyed , to keen general grief : besides Cassiopeia and Danaus , all the Seripheans and sundry palace guards were slain  --  including Galanthis , whom Cepheus had had the satisfaction to dispatch and posthumously geld . Fresh flesh lay everywhere among the petrified . Slightly wounded , Cepheus wept by Cassiopeia 's corpse : a guard tapped my shoulder and deferentially pot himself and his surviving comrades at my orders : was it my pleasure that Cepheus and Andromeda be killed at once , or reserved for torture ? Before I could reply that they were on pain of flaying to obey henceforth no other than their ancient king , Cepheus entreated me to spare his daughter 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already flown to Hades with his black queen 's shade . Fetching up Athene 's dirk ( scuffled himward as his cup had me- ) he hilted it to heart , spat blood , rolled eyes , and died as he had lived , al Cassiopeia 's feet . Andromeda wailed from her perished paramour dead-dadward , even washed with tears her hard mother 's hair , root and follicle of our misfortunes . Then she rose above all , still regally herself , faced me from the fear-chased figure of chicken Phineus , and invited me to kill her as I had everything she prized . " Sorry about your folks , " I said . " Danaus too . " But she 'd none of my apology : as I well knew , she declared , sill had n't loved my young half-brother , only consoled herself wits him : it was I she 'd loved  --  Perseus the man , not gold-skin hero o : demigod  --  and wedded we , till I had by lack of heart-deep reci procity murdered marriage and love alike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " except as mythics might mere mortals . " My soul winced from her words ; the fact remained , however  --  my fact , felt first to the auricles in the heart of Calyxa 's shritiewas , ineluctably and fur worse as much as better , one of the Zeusidae , a bloody mythic hero . " You 're free , Andromeda , " I told her . No thanks , " I 've always been ! " she cried . " Despite you ! Ever on the cliff I was free ! " I could n't follow her , let it go . Spear he : or spare her , she declared , she wanted no more of me : would re main in Joppa if alive , fetch from Argos our younger children Unpleasant middle Perseus , who had dwelt stonily between the young Destroyer and the New-Medusa 'd man , interrupted her ti sneer , " And find another Phineus ? " ? his last words , as I put bin to death promptly and forever on hearing me speak them . There fore 1 did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perfect wrath . In the first place , she raged , her uncli had been a kind and tactful fellow , no doubt no hero , but a bette : man in other ways than myself ; in the second , be me reminded was n't the only g-s 'd hero in the book : she could if she chose mos surely find another , even goldener ; but ( in the third place  --  am how her mother 's regal eyes flashed in her face ! ) the last thing shi cared to do was subject herself to another man , heroic or humble no Cassiopeia she , all she wanted , in what years were left her , wa to build as best she could a life of her own . What I craved , on thi other hand , she dared say , was a votary , a mere adorer , not a fel low human ; let me find one , then : the sea was shoaled with younf girls on the make for established older men - " Like your girl friend with the hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do what you please ; I 've stopped caring ; just leave me alone . " ' fill that last imperative she was in possession of herself ; aloa , undid her : she threw her arms around Phincus 's neck and &tact; his shoulder with fresh tears . My own flowed too , no want of eye wash in this episode . I unCepheus 'd my dagger , considered whirl of us to kill . Motionless as her renditions on the walls of Chernmis but in my tear-flood swimming as at my submarine . first sight o her , gentle Medusa stood just beyond the threshold . Half the fou chambers of my heart surged ; one ventricle , perhaps , would sta forever vacant , like a dead child 's chair , in memory of my morta marriage and late young-manhood ; one auricle , as yet unpledged shilly-shallied on the verge of choice . If only she 'd beckon , sure mon , relieve me of doubt . reach forth her hand ! But of course sh would n't , ever . For a pulseless moment I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply baleful Old and not the parr doxic precious New Revised Medusa .

" And ditto the next and next and next , till even our stars burn out . Half of each I Il unwind my tale to where it 's ours , and half of every we 'll talk . There 's much to say .

Shall I say how bright your stars are ? Just Delta Persei , please . Its magnitude ? ? " That does n't count . " Do answer , then . I have n't forgotten Calyxa 's mistake in I-E-1 .

For your information  --  but I 'm counting this , so I get to ask two in a row  --  my right eye , unlike your precious Delta P. , has a variable magnitude . If I 'm winking at anyone , it 's the whole wretched world down there , which I 'm glad to be out of . Back to your storytelling now : much as l et cetera , is n't it just possible the style is too mannered ? " Excellent Medusa , sweet salvatrix : leave such questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , but I would n't spend eternity with one . That 's two . Three ? " You 're the monster in this menage ! Do reflect , darling , that if the Perscid were n't my favorite fable I 'd have starred us in a different one , with a more flattering role for me and a less for you . Now I will ask another literary question : that business just before the climax , where Andromeda flings herself between you and Danaus ... You 'll agree it 's a trifle melodramatic ? " Heavens yes . In fact , from this perspective , a clumping klitsch . As is the whole story nowadays , I daresay . But that 's how it was , and at the time we were archetypes , not stereotypes ; reality , not myth . Your own stonework , so realistic in its day ; bet it 's legendary now . So it goes . " I yield .

" And now ? " Now it 's my turn . Let 's sec . Why does Cassiopeia spend half the night with her head in the ocean ? " If you could ask her , she 'd say she 's washing her hair ; Athene made me put her where she 'd have to soak her head now and then , to mollify the Nereids . Your heart 's not in that question . " Well . What ever happened to Cousin Bellerophon ? " That 's another story . Look . I 'm counting two halfhearted questions as one whole . Do ask a real one ; you 've only four left . " Calyxa ? " Must you , Perseus ? No question . " Calvxa . " It was brutal of you , darling ! Brutal to jump from my ' arms into hers , when I 'd just rescued you ; brutal again to compare us in bed , as if my awkwardness were anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't reply . And brutal finally to dwell on her the way you did and do . Do n't you think I have feelings ? " No question . I 'm more or less contrite . But look here : in the first instance , do n't forget I thought I 'd lost you " Your own fault . " Quite . In the second , although my friend Calixa is n't at the heart of the story , it 's her fate  --  her immortal part s fate  --  to spend eternity at its navel , where it and I both came to light . Have you done something dreadful with her ? " Sweetheart , you are a perfect prick ! " RSVP . " Only if you promise you 'll never ask this question again for all eternity .

Now tell me. how comes it to pass , sweet  --  what all this lit-Grit 's been building up to  --  that in a drama whose climax and denouement consist ostensibly of your choice , however belated and three-quarter-hearted , of Yours Truly for eternity 's second half , the two female leads are Andromeda and What's-HerName , that bit of fluff in your Egyptian omphalos ?
