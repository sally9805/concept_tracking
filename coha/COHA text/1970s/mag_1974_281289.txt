The announcer for the Rucker summer basketball tournament in Harlem was groping for the best way to express his enthusiasm over the new court phenomenon . The youngster heard himself called " Houdini , " " The Claw , " " Black Moses " - and none of the nicknames pleased him . He took the announcer aside . Softly but deliberately he said , " Call me The Doctor . ' " Julius Winfield Erving Jr. , 21 , was already demonstrating that he would be his own man . <P> The Doctor , or Dr. J. as it has been ever since , has become the most exciting and innovative young practitioner of the muscular art of professional basketball . With his unusual mix of solo razzle-dazzle and imaginative team play , the rangy 6 ft. 6 in. , 200 Ib. forward has revived the previously paralyzed New York Nets and restored them to instant health . Ervingless , the Nets finished next to last in the East Division of the American Basketball Association last season with a 30-54 record . As the league paused for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their division with a 34-20 record , and The Doctor was operating for 27 points per game , the best average in the league . <P> Human Helicopter . Erving 's on-court style has made him the A.B.A. 's top draw . When he drives to the basket , floor-bound opponents are flabbergasted by a human helicopter who can soar from the foul line to the backboard with magnificent ease . With Erving handling the red , white and blue A.B.A. ball , a standard stuff shot turns into airborne acrobatics , often ending in a backward , over-the-head slam dunk . A lay-up is embellished with the kind of fakery that the Harlem Globetrotters made famous . <P> Nets players as well as opponents shower him with superlatives . Erving , who will be 24 this month , discusses himself with neither modesty nor bravado : " I feel that I can drive , float , and change direction easily in the air better than most of the other players . It 's that freedom of motion that separates me . " Another Erving trick : in mid-dribble he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left free to fend off opponents , and soars into shooting or passing position without losing a step . The ploy , Erving says , " is quicker and more deceptive . You eliminate one move . " <P> His flamboyance on offense is only part of his value to the Nets . He leads the team in two vital defensive categories , blocked shots and steals . The latter statistic is usually the pride of smaller , supposedly quicker guards . Yet Erving is the second leading pilferer in the A.B.A. The Nets are a very young team ( average age : 24 ) , and they lost their first nine games this season while trying to knit their new talent . Erving quickly provided the necessary needles , sacrificing his scoring ( five points per game fewer than last season ) in order to set up plays for teammates . <P> Erving is at home with his new status and his new team , which plays just a few miles away from Roosevelt , L.I. , where he grew up . " Basketball was a type of escape for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little argument at home , rather than staying to fight it out I 'd go out to the park . " If he could find no one to play with , he would spend hours playing " one on none . " By his senior year in high school , scores of colleges were bidding for his services .
