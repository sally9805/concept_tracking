Surrounded by lush orange groves and vegetable gardens that stretch from neighboring hills down to the shores of the Mediterranean , the town of Damur lies twelve miles south of Beirut along the coastal highway . Damur is in a mountainous region of Lebanon known as the Chouf . The area is home to two of Lebanon 's best-known political leaders , Maronite Christian Camille Chamoun and Druze Kamal Jumblatt . Last week , in retaliation for a rightist Christian attack on a Palestinian refugee camp at Dbayeh , leftist and Druze militiamen , led by fedayeen officers , laid siege to Damur , an important road junction and rightist stronghold . For five days it was shelled by mortars and rockets . TIME Beirut Bureau Chief Karsten Prager visited the town after the shelling and house-to-house fighting ended . His report : <P> The corpse of a man , already charred and shriveled , was lying face down on the pavement , flames still licking at his back . A few feet away , a flock of tiny songbirds chirped in small wooden cages . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Mourabitoun garrison of the leftist Independent Nasserite Movement . Like the corpse , much of the town was burning ; flames crackled inside the solidly built houses of what was once a well-to-do community of 28,000 , mostly Christians . Smoke wafted over the debris-cluttered streets and rose in a solid sheet that was visible for miles around . A gas tank exploded with a dull thump ; an automatic rifle opened fire in the distance . <P> Except for the militiamen , who were gleeful and voluble in victory , the town was almost empty . Its defenders had retreated southward to regroup . Almost all civilians had fled to nearby Saadiyat , Chamoun 's seaside estate , which was also surrounded by leftist troops . Later , a small fleet of yachts and coastal steamers picked up the thousands of refugees and carried them to Juniyah , a large Christian stronghold north of the capital . <P> The handful of people remaining in Damur stood in a bedraggled group near a church-quiet , anxious , clinging to their few belongings , which they had wrapped in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unshaven Fatah officer-charged that Lebanese army commandos had helped defend the town , even though the army is supposed to be neutral . He gave the civilians the choice of staying or leaving for Christian-held areas ; they chose to leave . Except for medicine and bare necessities , they were not allowed to take anything with them . Militiamen loaded furniture , household goods , washing machines and stereo sets into a truck to be " held for safekeeping , " as one of the Mourabitoun explained it . <P> Near another church , a hard-faced Palestinian officer pointed his leather swagger stick at a blood-spattered wall near an abandoned sandbagged bunker . " From now on , " he said , " there will be no more forgiving . The rightists used to say that Lebanon would be a graveyard for the Palestinians . Now it 's a graveyard for them .
