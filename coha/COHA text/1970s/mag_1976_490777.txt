THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN the last few weeks , a number of spokesmen for the executive branch have begun to talk about a new danger emanating from the Soviet Union . Helmut Sonnenfeldt , an aide to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , recently observed that the Soviet Union was acquiring " the habits of imperial conduct , " and then the Secretary of State himself said , in a speech in San Francisco , " What is new today is the culmination of thirty years of postwar growth of Soviet industrial , technological , and military power . " And he said , " For the first time in history , the Soviet Union can threaten distant places beyond the Eurasian landmass  --  including the United States . With no part of the world outside the range of its military forces , the U.S.S.R. has begun to define its interests and objectives in global terms . " If phrases such as " what is new today " and " for the first time in history " lent an air of breathless discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some remarks made not long ago by General Alexander Haig , the commander of NATO , introduced a note of near-panic . In an interview in Newsweek , General Haig spoke of the Soviet Union 's strategy of " worldwide imperialism , " and said , " What we have been witnessing , at a relentless pace , is the propulsion of Soviet geopolitical power to superpower status . " He added , " We are getting to the fine edge of disaster ? ' In other words , hostility between the United S ates and the Soviet Union , far from being over , or even reduced , is just st irting up in earnest , General Haig moved the Cold War from the past into the future . These suggestions that an unprecedented threat from the Soviet Union is taking shape seemed to us to imply a sweeping nullification of past government policy , and they prompted us to look at some of the statements that were made back in the years when so the American people are now told  --  the Soviet Union was only a local menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union was without global designs in the postwar years , no one in or around our government knew it . For example , in 1957 Kissinger , who was a professor at Harvard at the time , wrote , " ' We will bury you , ' Nikita Khrushchev has said , and the democracies would have been spared much misery had they not so often insisted that dictators do not mean what they say . " And President Eisenhower was only reflecting an official consensus that lasted for decades when he said in 1956 that the basic aim of Soviet Communist policy was " to conquer the world , through world revolution if possible , but in any way , " and went on to say , " Anyone that has read any of their books knows that their doctrine is lies , deceit , subversion , war if necessary , but in any way : conquer the world . " It may he that this recent discovery of Soviet imperialism carries with it a confession that in the past the United States government overestimated the danger posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new " if it has been in existence for some thirty years . One sentence in Kissinger 's San Francisco speech hints at the possibility of such historical revisionism . " This evolution , " he said , speaking of the growth of Soviet power , " is now rooted in real power , rather than a rhetorical manifestation of a universalist doctrine , which in fact has very little validity or appeal . " The suggestion is that in past years the danger of world conquest by the Communists was in large part " rhetorical " rather than " real " ? to which one can only add that whether it was real or not it has ruled this country 's political life for thirty years . Any admission of error , however , if there is one , is to be found strict ! ) between the lines . To a reader of the lines themselves , the oblivion into which the past three decades have sunk is complete , and the reader is left to marvel at the imperturbable self-confidence and the boundless forgetfulness of our public officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has been the executive chef of the Plaza Hotel for nineteen years , has just been awarded the Grand Prize of the Salon of Culinary Art , which is the Silver Medal of the French Government . Chef Trombetti , forty-five years old , of no noticeable girth and of remarkably good disposition , presides over an underground kingdom the size of Liechtenstein . He begins his day with no breakfast except coffee , lunches at two ( still underground ) , and has dinner at home , on the southern border of 11'estchester County . He usually cooks his own lunch . His wife cooks dinner . He follows this routine six days a week  --  seven when there is a special occasion at the Plaza on a Sunday . A small banquet in his honor was given one night recently . He cooked more than half of that . The Plaza kitchen is a vast array of white-tiled columns and walls set off here and there by the Bicycle Jaunt calm black and calm gray of ranges and other equipment . It 's so big that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the stairs and the elevators leading to the dining rooms and banqueting halls aloft . No Smoking No Se Fuma . The only exception to this rule is at the chef 's table  --  a real table covered with one of the Plaza 's classic big pink tablecloths , and a little quadrangle of peace amid the enormous controlled chaos of the kitchen . It is far enough away from the up-to-date dishwashing machines and the turnof-the-century silver-polishing machines , which make old silver plate look new by dousing it in a cascade of water and ball bearings , to be comparatively quiet  --  the proper atmosphere in which to eat subtle food . At one o'clock on the day on which Chef Trotnbetti received his award , the onl ) man at the chef 's table was an officer of the Soci6t6 Culinaire Philanthropique de New York . As he waited for Trombetti to join him , sous-chefs of the Plaza approached one by one , bowed , and presented themselves for a moment 's conversation . Some hours later that day , we heard about all this when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Plaza , an unmarked door that we had never before seen was opened and our friend the old curmudgeon appeared . " I 've just spent almost the whole day belowdecks making one of my annual tours of inspection , " he said , " and I 've come upstairs with a hot tip . Can you have dinner with me in the Oak Room ? " We could , and the hot tip was little saut  --  ed bay scallops on a bed of spinach sauteed in butter . " My inspection today , " the curmudge told us , " also included the Edwardian Room , which is now again the Edwardian Room , and not the Green Tulip  --  a redecoration of the old classic which had us steady old patrons fainting in coils for some years . The Oak Room , thank God , did n't need much restoration , and , as you can see , what it needed has been accomplished . I feel sad about what happens to old hotels . They come to be looked upon as rich old widows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grand Central Terminal , which fed us all for a few years before Prohibition ended , because it had the finest openand-aboveboard speakeasy in town , disappeared long since . The old McAlpin , where all of us who were classmates of young Benny McAlpin at Princeton could stay weekends at half rate  --  four dollars a night as guests of his father , who owned the hotel , was bought up a few weeks ago , for the second time , by the Sheraton chain . The families that built the great old hotels tire of them or die out , and so the hotels are sold to the chains . Many of the chain hotels are run by managing directors who have wives who think they are interior decorators and get on the payroll at twenty-five thousand per . Fine old moldings and panellings are replaced by plastics that would be of value only if they were edible . The New Haven Railroad was helped on its way to one of its bankruptcies by an interior-decorator wife who had the same sort of ideas . Conrad Hilton gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , the way you gather in those Atlantic City hotels in the game called Monopoly . Hilton and some other chain-hotel owners collected so many hotels that the Justice Department , which watches over such things as incipient monopolies , decided that these men were winning the game , and told them to start all over again , with fewer hotels . At any rate , Hilton had sold the Plaza shortly before to A. M. Sonnabend , of Boston , and now the Plaza has come into the hands of Western International Hotels , a chain that was a small Far Western outfit when I began patronizing it . Montana , Utah , Idaho -- places like that . That , as I remember , is also the way the Hilton chain 1-kgan . Small and far away . Enchanted by the name of a railway , the Quanalt Acme &; Pacific , I determined quite a few years ago to explore it during my annual inspection tour of Texas , and nightfall found me in Plainview , in that state , at the portals of a hotel that proclaimed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the original Hilton . It was fully booked by a convention , but 1 levelled my basilisk eye upon the receptionist and he , transfixed , said that I could occupy the grand ballroom after ten P.m . Armed with a key , I let myself into the ballroom at ten-ohone P.m. and discovered in a huge expanse of stacked tables and chairs a fully furnished cot and , beside it , what was apparently the ballroom 's piano stool . Just off limits there was a properly prepared bathroom . In less than fifteen minutes , I had found the switches that extinguished all the lights and spotlights and was abed . In peace  --  until seven-fifteen the next morning , when a rather startled housemaid , duster at the ready , came upon me . The bill I paid was moderate for the grandeur I had endured , and as I was paying it I noticed a banner above the cashier 's desk : " NOW AT LAST YOU CAN HAVE HILTON SERVICE IN NEW YORK TOO AT TITE PLAZA HOTEL . " Ah , me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? The Hilton in Plainview still stands , and under that name , though it is no longer part of the Hilton chain . " A moderately young man in a three-piece suit  --  Frank Finneran , the Plaza 's manager  --  approached our table . The o.c. eyed the waistcoat with evident approval . " It has been reported to me , " Mr. Finneran said to the curmudgeon , " that you have been helowstairs for some hours and have just come up . I thought I would find you in here . " " I 've been nosing about your premises today , " the curmudgeon said , " and I 'm hapm to say that the hotel is beginning to look more like its old , original self . As you know , I spent most of my younger years in hotels . " The old curmudgeon never says " my childhood , " because it is so unlikely that a man of his mien began life as a child . " In fact , I always wanted to be a hotel manager . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 'm one up on you . And I 've got ten and a half million dollars to spend on making this hotel look the way you remember it . Hove you seen the Persian Room : " " Yes . I was there at a party the other night to hear my old friend Eartha Kitt sing . A funny girl . I went backstage to see her and talk about the days when she and I were together at the old Blue Angel . And , by the way , if you have ten and a half million dollars to spend , why did n't I see any of those handsome Persian Room matchbooks with the green and blue triangles all over them ? " " Well , " said Finneran , " I do n't know about those matchbooks , but we arc getting the big white Plaza Hotel matchbooks as soon as a strike in Ohio is over . " Then he asked if the ( - Lc. had seen the restoration going on upstairs . The o.c. had n't , so after dinner  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his associates ; and Steve Pletcher , who is in charge of the hotel 's reformation  --  we got into an elevator . Finneran said that the elevators were the one impending change that might bother the old curmudgeon . The original Plaza elevators are mounted on steel shafts twenty stories high and arc operated b ) hydraulic pressure . When the elevators are at ground level , the tips of the shafts are twent ) stories underground . The customers , it seems , complain about the slowness of the ascent . " We 'll try to make the cages of the electric elevators that will replace those like the one we 're in look exactly the same , " Finneran said . " And anyway these cages will all be preserved , because we 've had bids for every one of them from our patrons . " The curmudgeon said , " I 'll take one of them right now . It would make a lovely gazebo on my place in the country . " The best of the upstairs suites opened to us by Finneran 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , with a little turret at the Fifth Avenue corner of the living room , It was a rainy evening , and Central Park was an Impressionist painting of the Bois de Boo14.igne . The o.c. sat in every chair he could , and smiled . " No plastic , " he said . In many of the suites , the moldings and the ceiling ornamentation and the wall panellings and the gray marble fireplaces were in their pristine state . " Mops , " said Finneran as he opened up one suite . He and the curmudgeon stared at a hare ceiling and at wall moldings painted an unpleasant robin's-egg blue . Then they stared at each other . " We 're not renting this suite until it 's fixed , " Fin-neran said . The curmudgeon ended his day at the Plaza in the Palm Court , eating Schwarz-welder cake and French ice cream . " Have to watch my waistline , " he said . " And , you know , I 'm puzzled by those three young men who have been showing us around . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . What next The two of us sat at a table near the platform on which in other days there had been a little night music . Suddenly , there was a little night music again . A Viennese violinist raised his how to his addle , then spotted the o.c . " I have n't seen you in all the years since Nino 's closed , " he said , and he asked the pianist , " Do you see who 's out front ? " " Watch this , " the o.c. said to us . " They 're going to ask us what we want them to play , and I 'm going to say the entire score of Leo Fall 's The Dollar Princess . ' It 's an old joke . I love to stump musicians with it . " " What do you want us to play ? " the violinist asked the curmudge . " How about the entire score of ' The Dollar Princess ' ? " he said . Headquarters T ? get to the campaign headquar- ters of Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States , you go to 507 Fifth Avenue , ride the elevator to the third floor , step tip to the reception counter , and ask for Sylvia . Chances are excellent Sylvia will be in . She will buzz Alan Abel , the freelance public-relations man who nuns Sam Silverstein 's campaign . Chances are pretty good Mr. Abel will be in , and if he is , he will step nut of his office , which used to be a broom closet , and tell you all about his man . Chances are slim you will get to meet Sam Silverstein , who , because he hates to travel , has decided to sit out most of the campaign at home in Pittsburgh . As Presidential candidates go , Sam Silverstein is diverting . For starters , be uses a nom de campaign to discourage crank callers , his real name being Allan Pinsker . Pinsker Silverstein promises nothing and says he can deliver on that promise . He wants to take all the members of Congress off salary and pay them on a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silverstein does n't deserve a place on anyone 's list of " serious candidates , " but he is genuinely , officially in the race . The room across the hall from Mr. Abel 's office is the Silverstein for President headquarters . It has a view of Fifth Avenue , two desks , and lots of crepe-paper streamers . In fact , inch for inch , the Silverstein digs have more crepe-paper streamers and cr &pepaper; hunting than any of the eleven other Presidential-campaign headquarters recently set up in Manhattan , and we know , because we have seen them all . A lot can be learned from a tour of a dozen Presidential headquarters . A well-equipped campaign office has three indispensables : a coffee machine , a printing press or photocopier , and good phones . For instance , when we visited Senator Henry Jackson 's office , on East Fifty-seventh Street , the other day , a man from the Telephone Cornpany was busy installing sufficient hardware to keep a prodigious number of voters on hold indefinitely . In this respect , the Jackson nerve center compares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine that will deliver a tape-recorded message from the candidate but has no copying or coffee facilities . The Jackson people believe in phones , and they believe in the photogenic powers of their candidate ; they have his picture posted all over the place . This follows the pattern of most of the other Democrats  --  Fred Harris , Jimmy Carter , Birch Bayh , Morris Udall , and Stanley Arnold  --  who currently have what could be called " working offices " in town . With the exception of Arnold ( about whom more in a moment ) , the Democrats have headquarters that are generically consistent . They are scattered about midtown in office buildings , and occupy uninspired work spaces that have been moved into hastily and often divided into jerrybuilt cubicles . The Democrats go in big for charts and lists and volunteer-sign-up sheets and envelopes . The charts break down the state into separate congressional districts and plot the strategy for the complicated New York primary election . The lists have headings like " Vol u nteers , " " Canvassing , " " Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Advance People , " and " Schedules . " Presidential politics has become a first-name business : the candidates are Fred , Jimmy , Birch , Mn , and so on , and the people worldng for them are Howard , Steve , Cindy , Peter , Dave , Michael . In most headquar ters , the I-Inwards and Steves and Cindys have their names listed on small white envelopes that have been taped to the wall . They receive messages in these envelopes . Good telephones may be indispensable , but handwritten messages offer excitement . At Birch Bayh 's headquarters , which has two printing presses and plastic bunting , the campaign workers get their messages not in little envelopes but in roomy cardboard boxes . Fred Harris appears to have attracted a sizable number of moonlighting college students , none of whom wear neckties around the office . We saw a few neckties at Jimmy Carter 's headquarters , but all the men wearing them had loosened them at the collar . The talk there was in low tones- - about " gearing up " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two Carter partisans discussed somebody 's nephew who lives in a certain congressional district in Westchester . " Is he more of an issue-type guy ? " one partisan asked . The other partisan replied , " Not only that . He 's a Republican . " The Bayh office , at Fortieth and Lexington , plans to expand to two floors soon , and its occupants might give some thought to annexing the space that Senator Lloyd Bentsen abandoned a few weeks ago on East Forty-sixth Street . Before he withdrew from the Presidential-primary races , the senator had a New York office with eight rooms , one of them large enough for square dancing , and only two people were working there when we dropped by . The four-to-one rooms-to-people ratio put the Bentsen camp in a tie with that of Gerald Ford , whose supporters have set up shop on East Fifty-sixth Street , behind a locked black door with gold lettering that says " THE PRESIDENT FORD COMMITTEE NEW YORK . " We rang the bell the other day , and a woman named Jean Ritze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue rooms , entirely empty of people and largely empty of furniture , though one room contained a large , smiling color photograph of the President . Miss RitzenthaIer explained that she was " holding the fort , " and then showed us the way out of the fort . By running an apparently locked-door campaign , Mr. Ford has one thing in common with Lyndon LaRouche , the candidate of the U.S. Labor Party , which is the political arm of the National Caucus of Labor Committees . The Labor Party is so de- outiv Marxist that many of its members feel sure enough of themselves to dress like young stockbrokers . They ? ? occupy five floors of a building in the garment district , which they share with several furriers , and they regard visitors with profound suspicion . Instead of good phones , the Labor Party has great telex facilities . The telex machines pull in vast amounts of what LaRouclie 's supporters call " intelligence . " They expect their man to run a good race . One of the other non-capitalist organizations in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Willie Mae Reid for Vice-President . The S.W.P. regulars , who have a strong antipathy to the Labor Party , work out of a clean , wellit five-room office overlooking Union Square . It contains the indispensables , and has a special sense of permanence , because it will revert to a workaday Socialist hangout when the afterglow of the election fades . The only two candidates whom we actually met when we made our rounds were Peggy Hoenig and Stanley Arnold . Any natural-born citizen thirty-five years old or older who has resided within the United States fourteen years can run for President . Most of those who do run register with the Federal Election Commission , but some do n't bother . Peggy Hoenig , like Sam Silverstein , has bothered . The Federal Election Commission lists her party affiliation as " unknown , " and her motivation for the Presidency . A half minute after Mrs. Hoenig orchestrates her campaign out of an eighty-dollar-a-month rent-controlled studio apartment on Greenwich Avenue , in the Village . She also lives there . It is the only campaign headquarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the central feature of her sprint for the Presidency . A half minute after we arrived , Mrs. Hoenig sat down at the piano to demonstrate her claim that she has inherited the legacy of Jimmie Davis , the singing governor of Louisiana , who collaborated in writing " You Are My Sunshine " in 1940 . Mrs. Hoenig sang that song and a hymn called " The Old Rugged Cross " and a few other numbers before we could get her to stop . She told us she had never heard of Sam Silverstein , and then she showed us the black lace gown that she plans to wear to her Inauguration . Stanley Arnold 's campaign headquarters , in the Seagram Building , ranks as the plushest of any candidate 's , because it also happens to be his office during off-election years , and Mi . Arnold , a Democrat , has made enough money to furnish it very nicely . The centerpiece is an attractive carved wooden tabletop desk , and this is augmented by several well-upholstered chairs , a mahogany-and-glass breakfront containing leather-hound books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the marketing consultant who ran for the Vice-Presidency in 1972 and did riot win . He 's running for President this time around because , he says , " no one else is talking sense . " When we spoke with him , he was just about to depart for Rochester , New Hampshire , " to make a major address to an amalgamation of four women 's clubs . " He showed us a laudatory article about his candidacy which had appeared in the Rochester Courier , and said he would he in the race " straight down to the wire  --  although it all depends on what happens in New Hampshire , does n't it ? " In the reception area , as we were getting ready to leave , we asked Mr.
