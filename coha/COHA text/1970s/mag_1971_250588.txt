The small and often clubby group of men who run the nation 's financial center are acquiring an unlikely new member this week . H. Ross Perot , the 40-year-old computer multimillionaire from Dallas , will formally take control of F.I . du Pont , Glore Forgan &; Co. , the nation 's third largest brokerage firm . No one on Wall Street seems quite certain how to welcome a Nice Guy from Texas . A banker sent Perot a cowboy suit , and an F.I . du Pont salesman ordered a pair of tasseled loafers for his new proprietor . Perot showed up in Manhattan wearing his usual Middle America business togs and shook hands with each of the 1,500 F.I . du Pont employees working in the head office . " I wanted to tell them that they are terribly important to the future of the firm , " he explained with his ever-present country charm . <P> So , for that matter , are Ross Perot and his Texas-size bank account . Last summer the Du Pont firm , hard up for capital as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merge with Glore Forgan Staats , thus picking up some $18 million in new money . Even that infusion was not enough , and to raise cash last November F.I . du Pont tried to sell 100,000 shares that it owned in Perot 's computer-servicing company , Electronic Data Systems Corp . It had acquired the shares in a contract with E.D.S. for computer services . The deal called for Perot 's company to buy Du Font 's computer hardware , then to lease it back to the brokerage firm for part of the time and to other customers for the rest . When Perot heard about the attempted stock sale , he knew that F.I . du Pont was in trouble . <P> Urged by Washington . Some high officials in the Nixon Administration also knew , and they feared that a collapse of F.I . du Pont might wreck other salvage operations then under way on Wall Street , notably the rescue of Goodbody &; Co. by Merrill Lynch . These Administration officials urged Perot to step in . Perot at first agreed to put up $10 million ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point , Perot feels that he acted in part from patriotism , as he is doing in his well-known campaign to free American war prisoners in Viet Nam . " It was something I could do and something I ought to do , " he told TIME 'S Houston Bureau Chief Leo Janos . " There was a situation ripe for investor panic . " <P> In all , Perot has put up $30 million and taken control of at least 80% of the shares in the brokerage company . The previous owners , including several members of the Du Pont chemical family , will retain a 10% to 20% interest , the exact amount to be determined by a complex formula based on how well the firm performs over the next two years . As the firm 's new president , Perot has installed one of the Texas-born vice presidents of his computer firm , 32-year-old Morton Meyerson.
