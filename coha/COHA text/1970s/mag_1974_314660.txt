The people of Beaver Falls , Pa. ( pop . 14,000 ) , a steel-fabricating town north of Pittsburgh , slowly retreated from their support of Richard Nixon with each Watergate shock ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) . Now they are glad that the long ordeal is over , but they bear him no ill will . <P> As he watched the resignation speech , Eugene Jannuzi , 58 , head of the Moltrup Steel Products Co. , took some comfort in the fact that Nixon 's hands were steady , his eyes clear and his voice strong . " As he spoke , " said Jannuzi , " I felt that I could forgive him much . " Edward Sahli , 70 , a General Motors dealer , also felt that Nixon " did the right thing " by resigning , but only because " the man could not have had a fair trial in the Senate . " Jannuzi still believes , as he has from the beginning , that Nixon was destroyed by his enemies . " What I would like to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . I have the feeling that somebody put some money behind it . " The Rev. George Carson , 52 , pastor of the Trinity United Presbyterian Church , said that some of his parishioners were " greatly sorrowed . " The minister himself is ambivalent : " In many ways the man has been misjudged , but he did make some errors . " <P> Karen Phillips , 24 , director of Christian education at Trinity United and originally a Nixon fan , had felt betrayed by the Administration when Spiro Agnew fell in disgrace last October . But the President 's farewell address shook her . " My heart went out to him , " she said . " I really felt he was in the same room talking to me , apologizing to me . " She was alone , and she wept before the TV set . Earlier , she had thought that Nixon should be subject to prosecution like any other citizen . After the speech she decided : " I think resigning is enough . I 'm willing to forgive and forget . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
