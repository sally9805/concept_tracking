Gerald Ford 's last week in office was in keeping with his first . Now as then , he was determined to provide continuity in Government and reassure the American people . " In sum , " said he in his final State of the Union address , " I can report that the state of the union is good . " <P> Ford promised not to infringe on Jimmy Carter 's responsibilities , " but rather to wish him the very best in all that is good for our country . I wanted the new President to get off to an easier start than I had . " Ford lived up to that pledge in drafting the budget message that he is delivering this week-his last important act of office . His $440 billion budget for fiscal 1978 ( beginning Oct. 1 , 1977 ) is more liberal than expected , with less severe spending cuts than in his previous budget . Ford 's projected deficit for fiscal 1978 is $47 billion , Carter 's about $50 billion . <P> When Ford arrived in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was greeted not only as a well-regarded former member but also as a President who had earned the gratitude of both sides of the aisle . Democrats clapped as vigorously as Republicans when Ford walked to the lectern , and his plain but quietly eloquent 45-minute speech was interrupted numerous times by applause . " This report will be my last , " said the President , playfully ad-libbing : " maybe . " <P> " I am proud today that America is at peace , " said Ford . " None of our sons are fighting and dying in battle anywhere in the world . " But he warned against cutbacks in defense spending . " The U.S. would risk the most serious political consequences if the world came to believe that our adversaries have a decisive margin of superiority . " <P> At home Ford pointed with pride to his success in trimming the inflation rate from 12.2% when he took office to a current 5% . Though he acknowledged that unemployment remained too high , he noted that 4 million more people were at work now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for personal and corporate tax cuts worth $7 billion this fiscal year and $15 billion in 1978-a futile gesture , since Congress is sure to pass Jimmy Carter 's own $10 billion to $14 billion tax program , which relies most heavily on temporary rebates . <P> Ford 's temperate approach put to rest the fears of Carter people that they might have to make drastic changes in a perilously brief time-by Feb. 15 , they must have their own fiscal 1978 budget prepared to submit to Congress . Without having to worry about the budget totals , they are free to concentrate on specific areas where they can take issue with Ford . He requests a sizable $12.9 billion jump in defense spending , to $123.1 billion . Carter can trim $5 billion or more from the total-as he pledged in the campaign - without upsetting many Pentagon plans .
