One Heart Breaking " There is a passion for declivity in this world , " Tennessee Williams has one of his characters say in Comino Real . The ultimate declivity is death . But the pain that accompanies this descent in Williams ' plays is a sense of what is lost during the journey-honor , gentleness , tenderness , brotherhood , the ability to love , or even communicate with , another human being . <P> In Williams ' view , life is an insensate jest in which a man is gradually divested of everything that makes life precious , except the gallantry to go on , the one rock-bottom value that Williams never relinquishes . The disenchantment presupposes an initial enchantment . Williams has always lived and preached the creed of the high romantic . The high romantic pushes his hopes , ideals , joys , pleasures and desires past practical limits , past sensible limits and , finally , perhaps past human limits . Like an eternal child , he wants it all and , when he can not have it all , his heart breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real , the sound of one heart breaking . Unfortunately , the play is too diffuse and episodic to record that sound resonantly . Williams oscillated between writing an ode to the romantic imagination and a bitter philippic against life 's raw deal . El Camino Real was once the royal highway from Santa Fe to Chihuahua , Mexico . In the play it becomes a literal dead end , a pothole of a tropical police state where the street cleaners lie in wait to cart away the appointed victims . These include some of the great romantics of history and literature , a sort of aristocracy of personal excesses : Casanova , Lord Byron , Proust 's Baron de Charlus , Marguerite Gautier , and Kilroy , an American with a heart " as big as the head of a baby . " <P> Clouds in a Gale . The play is Williams ' most ambitious departure from realism ; it also makes enormous imaginative demands on the director . In 1953 , when Camino Real was first presented , Williams indicated the scope of those demands in his preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of something wild and unrestricted that ran like water in the mountains , or clouds changing shape in a gale , or the continually dissolving and transforming images of a dream . " <P> This revival at Manhattan 's Lincoln Center comes nowhere near achieving this . Under Director Milton Katselas , the production always hints at emotions that it never arouses , and is never deeply moving in the way that one knows the play could be . Only Jessica Tandy ( the original Blanche Du Bois ) brings into her Marguerite the authentic Williams tone of defeated gentility , of the violated heart , abusive in self-judgment and terribly tarnished by the world , yet untarnished in spirit .
