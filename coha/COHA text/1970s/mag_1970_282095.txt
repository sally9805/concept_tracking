Several generations of Hollywood actors have made their living wearing U.S. military uniforms in war movies . Even when not entertaining in Viet Nam , Martha Raye likes to don the jaunty regalia of the Green Berets . But antiwar demonstrators have also used Army clothing-in protest plays . <P> Three years ago , Daniel Schacht , an electronics consultant , turned up outside the Houston military induction center wearing a khaki Army shirt and World War II officer 's cap . Outside the center , he performed in a piece of " guerrilla theater " meant to dramatize American brutality in Viet Nam . Schacht was convicted of violating federal law that forbids wearing a distinctive part of a military uniform in theatrical productions if the role " discredits " the military . Schacht was sentenced to six months in prison and a $250 fine . <P> Last week the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the conviction . The Constitution 's guarantee of free speech permits no double standard , wrote Justice Hugo Black ; a law can not survive that " leaves Americans free to praise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison for opposing it .
