txt As the third and final Skylab mission prepares to launch Friday ? after 6 days delay ? the U.S. aerospace community asks : Where is the nation 's space program headed ? Is Skylab III ? now perched on top of a patched Saturn V booster ? ushering in a new era ? Or is the space program headed for a period of decline , assailed by national shortages and tighter budgets ? Officially the next step is the space shuttle of the late 1970 's . Ferrying men and payloads to and from earth orbit , the shuttle is to cut operating costs by using the same basic craft over and over again . But the mandate of the Apollo days is no more . Already , because of budgetary pressures , the space agency has proposed a less expensive shuttle system with fuel tanks that may not be reusable . Although initial appropriations have been approved , the public Is not yet conscious that the shuttle , budgeted at an estimated $50 billion by 1990 , is the largest non-military program being planned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote just after the successful Skylab rescue by astronauts Pete Conrad , Joseph Kerwin , and Paul Weitz and passed easily . However , the shuttle has some adamant critics in Congress . Sen. William Proxmire ( D ) of Wisconsin feels that the shuttle is another supersonic transport , where millions will be spent before the issue becomes visible and its folly realized . Sens . Walter F. Mondale ( D ) , Jacob Javits ( R ) , and J. W. Fulbright ( D ) also are skeptics. // *After Skylab 3 , what next ? // To space agency officials , the fate of the shuttle is the fate of the S. manned space program What Little Apollo equipment left is getting old . This is evident in the problem that delayed the Skylab III launch Discovery of hairline cracks in the fouryear-old Saturn V booster forced Cape Kennedy engineers to replace all the rocket 's railfins and to inspect it from top to bottom with magnifying-glasses The last scheduled use of Apollo equipment will be the Joint U S.-Soviet space flight in 1973 . An American Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts and cosmonauts can perform joint experiments . To most U.S space scientists , however , the venture is more an exercise in international relations than a step forward in space science . Meanwhile , Skylab " marks the transition " from exploring space to using space to benefit mankind , according to NASA director James Fletcher Skylab III will exphasize monitoring earth resources from space Some results seen Already officials point to some tangible results from the first two Skylab missions . The most immediate come from earth resources experiments ? a series of snapshots of Earth taken in different wavelengths stretching beyond the sensitivity of the human eye . For instance , Dr. M. Leroy Jensen of the University of Utah feels he may have located two " elephant ore deposits " in Nevada . These are vast concentrations of ores from which millions of dollars of minerals are mined . With Skylab imagery he was able to pinpoint volcanic outcroppings that suggest the mineral-bearing layer is close to the surface . In drought and famine-stricken Africa , Skylab investigator Norman MacLeod of American University reports having located an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being farmed He reports that Skylab pictures will help African geologists locate spots to dig wells . The final Skylab mission may last for 85 days . Medical reports from the first two missions also are being cited as proof that man can live and work in space . Preliminary results from the second mission indicate that the astronauts ' condition stabilized by the 39th day . After that , the astronauts even gained back some of the weight they had lost . Skylab 2 commander , Alan L. Bean , reported that he felt they could have stayed in space indefinitely . ( He requested that their mission be extended , but was turned down . ) Although none have ever been in space before , the final Skylab crew anticipates no trouble . The mission commander , Marine Lt Gerald P Carr , feels that " the space program has matured to the point where previous flight experience is not . mandatory . " The two other members of the final crew are Air Force Lt. Col. William R. Pogue and physicist Edward G. Gibson . Complexity growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital to the shuttle program Not only is the shuttle planned as a launch vehicle to put bigger and more complex satellites into orbit , and repair them ; but also , to carry scientists and engineers into orbit on extended missions . The European Space Research Organization ( ESRO ) has agreed to build a space laboratory , very much like Skylab , that would fit into the shuttle 's cargo bay . Besides the congressional critics , many scientists fear that the amount NASA intends to spend on the shuttle will cut deeply into other space science , such as the unmanned exploration of the planets . Already some programs have felt the crunch of NASA 's declining budget . Instead of two probes to Venus and Mercury , only one was sent . If it experiences some catastrophic accident , then the entire mission will be a failure . The Grand Tour where a single space craft could have passed by all the other planets , was also cancelled .                   @ @
