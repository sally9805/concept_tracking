Most readers of the Ladies ' Home Journal could take a lesson in thrift from the magazine 's part-time correspondent Lynda Johnson Robb . Seven months pregnant , L.BJ. ' s older daughter rode a Trailways bus from Washington to New York to turn in an article on young marrieds . Aghast , the editors rented a limousine to drive her back to D.C. But when Lynda learned that the car would cost the magazine $150 , she politely declined and returned home on the bus . <P> English Novelist Lawrence Durrell , traveling in the U.S. to promote his latest opus , Nunquam , announced a discovery . " What I thought was a slight earthquake going through the whole place that made me thirsty all the time , " Durrell reported , " is actually your gin . It 's 90 proof . Ours in London is 60 . " <P> A leading customer suggested that those high-fashion models at the House of Christian Dior are considerably less comely than they used to be . Quite so , replied Dior 's chief designer , Marc Bohan-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choicest lovelies , only to lose them to rich husbands . Today 's Dior girl , explained Bohan , is " elegant , but not so marriageable . " <P> A costume race on skis is a yearly feature at the Storlien mountain resort near Stockholm , and an enthusiastic contestant for the fourth straight year was Crown Prince Carl Gustaf , 23 . Dressed as a field surgeon in gown and rubber gloves , Sweden 's future king made a sprint for the finish line and wound up on his back with two broken skis . Two days later the costumed " surgeon " needed the ministrations of a genuine medical man . After clipping a slalom gate , he wound up the season with a broken left arm . <P> The visitor was not impressed by America : " The desperate contests between the North and the South ; the iron curb and brazen muzzle fastened upon every man who speaks his mind . . . The stabbings and shootings , the coarse and brutal threatenings exchanged between Senators under the very Senate 's roof , the intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crawling , sneaking party spirit into all transactions of life ... I believe the heaviest blow ever dealt at Liberty 's head will be dealt by this nation in the ultimate failure of its example to the earth . " The date : 1842 . The commentator : Novelist Charles Dickens , in a newly discovered letter to a friend back home . <P> Not too inaccurately , one overenthusiastic official called Chicago 's Mayor Richard J. Daley " the greatest Democratic phenomenon in the country . " He was topped by a colleague , who went through Daley 's name , supplying a laudatory adjective for each letter -D for diligent , A for adorable , L for loyal , E for energetic , Y for youthful . It was n't a testimonial dinner-just a routine meeting of the Cook County Democratic Committee .
