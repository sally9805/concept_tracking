txt Penrhiwceiber Colliery , South Wales When miners come up from the ground and spill out of the lift cage , they almost run . If you want to stop one , you have to shout , and even then , while they talk , they pull away , they want their showers . They move fast behind each other . If caught by a camera , they would look like a frieze on a charred Gieek temple . Several of them carry logs in the crooks of their arms , wood picked up around the pithead for a fire back home . It is hard to focus on a miner 's eyes at first because of a feeling he is in costume and makeup . He has coal dust in his ears and-on his eyelashes . Black sifted on the silver hairs of one man 's chest down to the V of his shirt . But in spite of the dust , many of the younger miners wear their hair long . " They are supposed to wear hairnets or put it in a bun , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some carry shampoo " Some carry a bottle of shampoo , " he grinned , speaking in that South Wales lilt which resembles an Indian or Pakistani accent . " The showers , that 's another thing . The Coal Board says men can take a shower in seven minutes , " one miner said . " That 's just not true . ' Course you do have the occasional man who gets under and it flows off . But not most of them " There 's something unsayable in a miner 's eyes . Even when he talks about being underground he can not fully convey what it means . By looking down into the shaft that swallows up the lift cage you can get a hint The shaft is unrelieved black ; it is deep beyond immediate comprehension , it is from a monster tale it beckons to the elemental unknown . About 70,000 miners out of Britain 's total 270,000 stay in that black for about seven hours a day The walls are hot unless the fan is on , the space is cramped , the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep One Yorkshire schoolteacher who took her class down into a mine found it frightening . " It was this sense of being in a completely alien world I had to make a concentrated effort to visualize the colors blue and green " Color is not so important to a person until there is no color The colliery yard at Penrhiwceiber has only dull colors The winding tower , a faded olive green , sits on a gray ground with puddles of water which look as if they were squeezed from coal Iron carts climb out of the earth loaded with coal chunks Tidily , bite by bite , the carts eat out the inside of the mountain What the miners call " muck " ( wastage from the coal ) is dusted tverywhere It is muck which is piled into the tips which are so dangerous and sometimes slide down mountain sides Colors are dull but at least here at 1uenrhiwceiber the sky can be a breathless blue , and " we can see the grass , " said one miner If you ask the wife of almost any miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'll say , " Oh my no , " and will add , " It 's too dark . " In addition , the mine is traditionally a man 's world Years ago women and children worked underground , but no longer . The all-male world of the miner has a deeper , more serious element than the all-male world of , say , the construction worker ( Miners notice a woman in the colliery yard , but there are no catcalls , no whistles , no snide remarkii ) The miners here are not boisterous men , perhaps because their work was rough . Many of them had worked 18 to 30 years in the mine , since the age of 14 The only reason they would leave mining now , they said , was if they had to because of low pay They did n't want to leave . Thert are no friendships like those made under the dark , hard conditions underground , some said . The shower rooms and canteens of a colliery are the equivalent of the football locker room ? but more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hidden awareness of that , and an undercurrent of virility in being able to work on the coal face , connote a very male grappling with the hardness of the earth and the danger of the unexpected .
