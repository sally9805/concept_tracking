Halfheartedly considering an abortion , we were married in October , Lavinia was born in late April and that effectively wound matters up . Had our ambition sustained we might have continued even with the baby , but we were n't the troupers of old ; the early vaudevillians were a much hardier lot , possessed of more heart and stamina : kids are no longer born in wardrobe trunks in Pocatello , Idaho .

I tried to talk Abby into taking engagements . " With a four-month-old ( year-old , eighteenmonth , two-year-old ) baby ? " she asked as if I were demented . At four Lavinia ( named after Abby 's great-aunt ) was wearingglasses . A sweet , humorless , beautifully mannered kid . Unexcitable but bright as a May morning .

There are , however , drawbacks  --  if you care about music . With a mickey mouse outfit like Hi 's , the music is relentlessly banal ( though you may be playing with excellent musicians ) and frequently ethnic ( Jewish weddings , Hawaiian luaus , Irish clambakes , Chinatown fashion shows , country club " Mexican Night " ) , and funny hats and coats are generally requisite .

An Episcopalian pianist friend of mine from Boston , a junkie for thirteen years who later converted to Zen Buddhism , told me that in the latter stages of his addiction he could go for thirty-day stretches without moving his bowels . ( There 's your psychological preventative , good doctors of Lexington , no shit ; forget the nausea-inducers . ) The Room of the Dons in the Mark Hopkins Hotel had been transformed for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marina Junior Women 's Garden Athletic Club . The elegant walls had been covered from floor to ceiling with a papier-m$che replica of red bricks and hung with print reproductions of Teddy Roosevelt , William Howard Taft and famous reclining nudes . Stretching one entire wall a fake-mahogany bar with authentic brass footrail and fat jars of pickled pigs ' feet spaced along its length . Ranging the bloodred rug some two dozen marble-topped tables clustered about tarnished turnof-the-centurystreet lamps . It was quite a good re-creation as these things go , a pigs ' feet-red plush nickel beer atmospherereeking of an 1899 of the mind 's eye . The bartenders , decked out in perky straw boaters and string ties , were just setting up as I came in . Long John Warneke was waiting for me  --  dolefully astride the piano stool , holding our brocaded vests , sleeve garters and bowler derbies  --  as good a jazz bassist as you will find on the Coast. 28 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONThree years with Hampton Hawes , four as house player at Shelly 's Manne-Hole in L.A. , now reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuba to enhance the combine 's versatility ( salability ) . John is extraordinarilytall and thin with a small sad Slim Summerville face , and when he blows into that nightmare instrument , bony knees wide apart and face purpling with the effort  --  not really blowing it , just a few blatting um-pahs in the key of C is all he can manage  --  your heart truly goes out to him . My heart sank now , bowels congealing like my junkie friend 's , as I took in the piano , not the respectable MasonHamlingrand that usually graces this room but a decrepit upright painted a gaudy silver , the front off and brightly colored tacks laid into hammers to impart a ricky-tic or rinky-rink or whatever that pitiful inane anti-music sound is called . " Is it as bad as it looks , John ? " " I have n't had the guts to try it . " I ran off a few arpeggios and groaned aloud . Middle D was missing and the two A 's above it , like the center teeth out of a rake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abysmal sensation , emitting the hollow resounding clack of brass tacks , and it occurred to me that the hammer pads of this sorry violated instrument had been deliberately thinned out for the sake of volume . Gutted pianos have always unnervedme : the lack of tactile control can be harrowing , like riding the jump seat of a motorcycle on an ice-slick road . John and I balled up our coats , laying them beside the piano ( which is why Hi Hildebrand 's sidemen 's tuxedos look scruffier than anyone else 's ) , and as we donned the Gay Nineties accouterments , three stunning queens hired for the occasion stepped through the swinging kitchen-connecting doors . Tall , lissome , bosomy girls in black-mesh stockings and skintight sequin-studded corselets , their fronts amply exposed ( like my sorry piano ) . Circular decals pinned to their waists announced them as Maxine , Victoria and Inez  --  waitTHEELECTRIC COTILLION 29resses , not apparitions ; their bare shoulders smelled of jasmine , and gorgeously colored plumes rose from their heads . " Looking forward to working with you ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the one labeled Victoria ; she had a husky put-on tart 's voice , violet eyes and staggeringly beautiful legs . " Are n't you going to put a note in the pint ? " said Maxine with a Liverpudlian inflection . I had thought all British girls were small-breasted ; not this gum-snapping East End Galatea . " I do n't get you . " " The pint mug , " she said , lifting the empty beer schooner from the piano top and moving it in front of my eyes as for the benefit of a mongoloid . " Pop a note in . We 'll try to turn out their pockets and we share it out at closing time . Anyone tries to tip you a half or quarter spit in their bloomin ' eye . " " My how you do talk dearie , " said Inez in a singsong vapid tone . The shortest and seemingly youngest of the three , she had dark flashing eyes and continuously ground her hips in an absent slow-motion way as if performing in some burlesque house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , the ring-free fingers and brassy mien , I knew it was unlikely that either John or I could connect . These Klondike belles from some not-quite-first-rank model agency would have no more interestin us than in the yokel string-tied bartenders or the **31;12118;TOOLONG clerks on St. Patrick 's Day . Now the first guests began drifting in , Lillian Russells and Diamond Jim Bradys , feather boas and gold watch chains and mutton-chop whiskers . " Buffalo , " Victoria said crypticallyand the girls sashayed off , each , I noticed for the first time , with a candy-stripe bustle flouncing behind . John and I struck up our two-piece ensemble . The bird with feathers of blue Is waiting for you Back in your own back yard30 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONThe piano sounded brutal , clumps of notes rattling around the walls like loose marbles in a tin box .

" I got out as she shook her bustle saucily at me , strutting off with the proud regal carriage of the greatest burlesque queen of them all . The room was beginning to fill up , floridly costumed guests acting as a baffle , taking some of the edge off the sound , thank God , beer and champagne flowing , a few couples clumsily dancing in their gaudy nineties regalia . I was working like a teamster to control the piano , wrist and forearmmuscles knotting in a swimmer's-cramp vise . On " Doodle Doo Doo " John switched to tuba , his small mournful apoplecticface forlornly framed by the monstrous whorled tubing . He was doing his level best but I would have gladly exchanged all six and a half feet of him plus my tortured left hand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you play Hava Nagila ' ?

" It wo n't fit the theme , ma'am , " I told her out of the side of my mouth . I have an avid aversion to that tune , which I have played perhaps two thousand times during my professionalcareer , and sometimes fantasize that I will play it one last time , some ancient gravel-voiced member of the wedding calling the request to me , as I slip into the grave . " It wo n't fit the theme ! " I reiterated to this apparently deafTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 31woman , a variation on the classic rejoinder I once heard employed by a black intermission pianist at the Village Vanguard in the face of repeated harassment by a corn-fed matron insisting on " Shine On , Harvest Moon " : " I am sorry , madam , " he said , hands folded resignedly in his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but the management does not employ me to play that type of composition . " Classic ! I turned away from the velvet-and-lace woman and launched into " Five Foot Two , " up-tempo , my left hand , for some years now unaccustomed to stride style , working like a thresher to drive the beat , John following in my wake like an incapacitated tugboat , our roles reversed . " Put down that idiot instrument and play bass ! " I called to him . He had been appointed leader of the duo by virtue of seniority in Hi 's organization ( and my unwillingness to serve ) but I was boss instrument ; besides , we were old friends and he knew as well as I that he could n't play the bloody thing worth a damn . He complied , gingerly setting down the brass monster , mopping his face and picking up the bass , which took on the dimensions of a fat walking stick in his calloused plate-sized hands . A man in an Edwardian ice cream suit , trying to Charleston but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , almost impaling him on the neck of the fiddle , and ricocheted back to his partner . Straightening up , John turned dolefully to me . " Happy days are here again . " A half hour later we took a break . The nickel-beer atmosphere of this simulated saloon was deceptive . A schooner cost a dollar  --  no carte blanche for the band , needless to say ; the more prestigious the organizationthe chintzier the policy is a virtually inviolate rule of thumb  --  and as John and I took our first swallows of liquid gold , the spastic ice cream man bore down on us .

" Then I assume I 'll have to deal with you . " " Deal " was the word he used , advisedly , this Cerutti who was what ?  --  construction engineer , trucking-concern comptroller , manufacturerof aluminum siding , a buyer of scrap metals  --  my age or a year or two younger , full sleek black hair , sallow complexion and flat hooded eyes : a cobra 's eyes . I 've never seen a cobra 's eyes but they must look like Ralph Cerutti 's . John cleared his throat self-consciously and said , " I 'm handling the business end for Mr. Hildebrand . " Cerutti gawked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perched atop a gangling six-and-a-half-foot totem . Poor John , he was n't cut out for this , but the union decrees that someone must be delegated leader , no matter how small the combo . Cerutti 's gaze hastily descended , dull discflateyes level with mine . " I merely wanted to know if something could be done about pepping up the music . It 's not carrying . People at the other end of the room are having trouble dancing and distinguishingthe tunes . " " Really ? It sounds like an echo chamber to us .

Another fifty or sixty dollars would have got you a trio . Also the box  --  instrument I 've been supplied with is virtually unplay-able .

Dressed like sideshow freaks and having to put up with this for thirty-five lousy bean . " Possibly because we improvised the last chorus , " I said . A glint of something devious , wicked , anti-art , gleamed in the serpent eyes . " Then leave us hear the melody , Mr. Hildebrand . I 'll confess I 'm  --  " " Davey.

She had a face like a dish , slightly concave and virtually featureless : small blob of nose , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cupid's-bow lips . " We 're taking our intermission , " I explained slowly to this idiot couple . Mrs. Cerutti said pertly , " Well you just forget your presidentJimmy Hoffa or whoever it is and let 's hear those DiMaggios . We 're trying to have some fun . " This was above and beyond the call . I turned away , letting John mumble on about union regulations  --  forty-five on , fif-34 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONteen off  --  and sipped my beer , studying the sign over the bar , which declared in Old English lettering : Pink Garter SaloonOur Waitresses Are Young LadiesofImpeccable Moral CharacterHang on , Sloopy . Ten minutes later , eight bars into " Alabamy Bound " ( stool screwed up a few notches for more leverage , fingers hopscotching , trying to jump the dead notes ) , I noticed my dollar bill missing from the kitty-schooner and the next instantfelt Inez whipping the hip into me again .

" He was back on tuba again , sweating like a stevedore , faithfully followingHi 's orders to the letter ( " Spend at least half the night on horn , Dad , it 's very visual " ) and not even getting doubling pay to which he was legally entitled .

" Oh , you beautiful doll , you great big .. . Prophetically Victoria sauntered over and propped her empty tray atop the piano . " You 're going to knock the walls down , buster .

He dropped the pig 's foot in the kitty-schooner , and spreading his greased fingers wide , thumbs touching as if he were about to seize me by the throat , suddenly pounced mercilessly on the keyboard . Some two dozen notes jangled together like jammed automobilehorns , sustained . " Very pretty , " John murmured . Behind me I heard Victoria 's barrelhouse laugh tumble down the scale like a shower of lead coins . " Plenty of notes there , " said Mr. Cerutti . You poor dumb bastard , you have no soul , I thought sadly , watching Inez strut by bearing her shoulder-high tray of foam-topped schooners like an authentic gold-rush saloon Sally , hips flicking mechanically , singing in her thin wistful off-key voice : " Goodbye forever , old fellows and gals . . .

Goodbye forever , old sweethearts and pals .. . What do they think , the aura rises like a genie from a jar of pickled pigs ' feet ? Somehow we got through the evening  --  you always do  --  and at the close Cerutti was so bombed he draped a comradelyleaden arm around my shoulder and treated John and me to champagne cocktails .

" " When did you play for him ? Where ? " " One question at a time . Summer of sixty-three . I was playing dinner music in a restaurant outside Hyannis Port .

Say , could you turn that down ? " " What ? " " Your phonograph . A bit loud . " In fact , coming so soon after last night 's self-inflicted racket , it was giving me a booming headache .

" I had n't been in touch with Aura for almost three years , but the moment I 'd heard that rich , rolling , faintly wheezy voice over the phone , " How you feelin ' , baby ? "  --  her rhetorical all-purpose salutation  --  I knew who it was . " I 've heard of her , she 's been on the Coast for years . Dark , is n't she ?

" And it 's true , Hi does possess a humane streak  --  deeply imbedded and fat-impounded though it may be  --  which occasionally surfaces . Two months earlier he had been contractorfor a Barbara McNair packaged concert at Masonic Auditorium . The union classification for the hall required four standby musicians , that is they would not play but simply occupy chairs and be paid for an evening 's work ; so Hi hired Roy Starkey , an excellent jazz alto player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have foreseen that the show 's road manager , during the afternoon rehearsal , would observe Roy being guided to his chair by another musician . The manager waited until Roy was seated , then walked over and stared down at him for maybe a quarter minute . You could see Roy shifting in his seat , sensing the man 's presence . " Excuse me , but are you blind ? " Roy smiled up at the man silently , inquiringly . " Yes , I 'm talking to you . Are you blind ? " From ten feet away , helpless , I watched the uncertain flickering smile on Roy 's face . " Yes , I am . " " But you 're supposed to be playing this show . " " I understand I was employed on a standby basis . " " Standby , yes , but . . . how would you be able to read the goddam show if you had to ? " Spluttering , furious , the manager had shouted across the orchestra pit , " Who the hell is in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall Hi doing . " You had breakfast yet ? " he said now ; and before I could answer , " Come on , I 'll pop for coffee and Danish . Got some shopping to do . Here , take these with you . . . " He crossed to a billiard table heaped high with Xeroxed copies of sheetTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 49music and handed me the top sheets from four different piles . They were the latest tunes culled from Billboard 's Top ioo . As soon as a tune rose impressively in the charts Hi would buy it and Xerox lead-sheet copies . We might play it once and that would be the end of it , but he prided himself on a completely up-to-date book and rarely refusing a request . If a tune showed staying power , his arranger would write charts for from four to sixteen pieces . On a hotel job , during intermissions , Hi would make the round of the rooms where competitive bands were playing . " Listen to those assholes . That tune went out with Fanny Brice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair bridging his gleaming dome , he 'd cry exuberantly , " God willing , I 'll fuck ' em all ! " " Hi .

Yeah , sure thing . Bye-bye . " He handed the phone back to Flo . " My God , that prick still has the nerve to call me . " " Who ? " " Sid Jaeckel . You played the deb cotillion with me in February , did n't you ? " " No . " " After the gig , Marcy Forrester , the program director 's daughter , complimented him on the music and he said , calm as cotton candy , Let 's go back to my place and fuck .

" I took a wild stab and missed the mark by ten city blocks . Mouth jammed with pastry , Hi gazed at me askance . " You and John Warneke at the Mark . You did play the gig , 50 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONdid n't you ? " A fall-out of moist crumbs dropped onto my sleeve . " I remember now . " ( Leave us hear those DiMaggios ! ) " That was hard work .

I was reading in Esquire last month about Willie the Lion playing those Harlem rent parties keeping the melody and beat going in his left hand while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Hi does n't really mean these compliments but he thinks they 're good for morale . Not only does n't he mean them , he does n't possess the critical faculty to make them ; if you played recordings of Art Tatum and Liberace back to back he would be hard put to distinguish one from the other , much less offer an artistic appraisal . " John play much tuba ? " he asked casually . " He did , and you got plenty of yardage out of him that night . You at least ought to play him for doubling . " " I rent the horn for him , do n't I ? " Hi signaled the waitress , pointing to a plump butterhorn under the bell glass . " Hear he worked for Mort Hannah at the St. Francis last night . " " News to me . " This was slippery ground , for Hi will not abide disloyalty . He guarantees his first men like John and me and Les Nunes a minimum $7500 per annum in return for conspicuous allegiance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition even though you have an open night . Cross him and you 'll find yourself on his shit list for fair . He may or may not give you a second chance , will never confront you outright with the evidence , wo n't get in the least salty , but suddenly you find your work drops way off ( the $7500-minimum agreement is verbal ) , you can call him from now to next St. Tib 's Eve and he may , for old times ' sake , give you New Year 's and the second and third Saturdays in December , nights for which the most senile fiddle players , antediluvian drummers ( SunTHEELECTRIC COTILLION 51rise over Waikiki painted on the bass drum ) and inept threetunebanjo pickers are booked months in advance . He said mildly , crunching into the dripping butterhorn , " I trust old John knows which side his bread is buttered on . " I kept him company while he shopped for dinner .

Now where in the clang hell do they keep the truffles ? " CHAPTER 6I need only pass a hippie hitchhiker these days  --  and they are rampant in and around Frisco  --  to remind me that since 1962 every new day of my life has been a form of bonus , a gratis-day dispensed by chance or fate , for by all rights  --  by the space of an inch , the minutest pressure of hand on wheel  --  I should be in jail , literally ; at the very least , in the prison of my conscience . In the late fall of 1962 the quartet Val and I headed off and on was let go after the first week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infiltrating , the jazz market was declining ( " Bronx is up and the Battery 's down ! " ) and for six straight nights we had played to a virtually empty house . The proprietor , a humorless tin-eared accountant ( as I think on it , there are no senses of humor in the proprietaryend of this business ) , was not insensible to the trend . " Sorry , boys , but I was led to believe you played in a more modern vein . I need the big beat . " That term was just coming into currency  --  " the big beat "  --  and in those days we had a surging crazy-ass drummer who made Ringo Starr sound like a rheumatic baby tapping on his mother 's kitchen pans . Our contract ran for a month , we could have brought the union to bear , but the prospect of playing every night to that graveyard of empty tables with the tiny hurricane lamps flickering in the gloom ( Val juicing steadily , passing the hours working crossword puzzles , perversely cheerful : THE ELECTRIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing but green leas ahead of us , green leas ! That 's puzzle talk for meadows . . . " ) was too depressing , too demeaning . I drove back to Manhattan that night with a pint of scotch in my lap , cold and despondent , sick at heart . The rain , falling fairly heavily all evening , had slacked to a drizzle when I saw under a street lamp a skinny kid  --  no more than eighteen despite the thick tangled hair and straggly beard  --  sticking his thumb straight at me . Arrogant , demanding , coming a ways out into the road . I ca n't explain what happened then , I swerved toward him . . . something involuntary , vicious , some resonance of bitterness , a sour aftertaste from the evening 's humiliation prompting a canny voice in my mind , See how close you can cone . . . I missed , but I swear the car brushed the poncho he was wearing , and when I looked at the mirror I saw his rapidly receding eyes staring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And though I relate this now in reasonable calm ( passing another faceless bearded kid on Golden Gate Avenue ) there are times when I glance at my rear-view mirror and think I see his flapping dun-colored poncho , the coarse straggly beard and wide staring eyes . In the recreation room ( euphemism for two card tables , a half-dozen brass spittoons and an upright piano ) of the musicians ' union four cigar-smoking men were playing poker . One was the business agent , one the sergeant at arms , and the other two contractors  --  one I recognized , Jake Price  --  competitors of Hi 's . I have been a member of five different locals and a peculiar universal struck me again : No matter where you find them , Woonsocket or Manhattan , union officials around a card table ( musicians though they may be ) present the somber aspect of a gathering of unsuccessful , slightly disreputable businessmen . I stood watching the game for a few minutes ; no one paid me the slightest attention . Finally the business agent glanced up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for work . Piano . " " Apply for membership at the front desk . " " Wait , I know this guy , " Jake Price said . " Are n't you one of Hi Hildebrand 's stableboys ? " " I work for him , yes .

" Whatsamatter , ai n't Hi treating you good ? " " I 'm looking for extra work . " What I was looking for was deliverance from Hi 's fat clutches , a way out of harness , the brocaded vests and funny hats . No reaction . The atmosphere was murky , sullen ; decidedly uncongenial . Above the faded green table , gray smoke hung like a pall , curling languidly into a metal cone lamp . " I 'll call . " " Pair of treys . " " Jacks and fours . " The other contractor raked in the pot , rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth . " What style you play ? " " Any style . " " Butterfly ?

The Artistry of Niles Davey ( Fantasy L11264 ) . How fucking sad . Again silence . " Leave your name with the telephone tender , " Jake Price said , inspecting his cards . I walked out of the back room , away from the gray pall . JFK , were he alive and here , would n't have stood for it , would n't have let a pack of stogie-sucking no-talent back-room crackers treat his old Cape Cod sidekick so uncivilly ; would have sicced the Mafiosi on them , O'Donnell , THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 55Salinger , O'Brien , the whole glorious swinging take-charge crew . . .

Friend or foe ? I turned and found Val Catalona grinning at me , faint sour reek of booze through the after-shave lotion , the once taut lithe face gone to flesh , suffused with a semi-permanent " Florida tan , " pouches heavy under the deep-set eyes , still direct but milder now , watery and reflective , the fires banked . My mind spun back twelve , fifteen years to the motels of Syracuse , Albany , Hartford , at that stage the booze an energizer only , mere fuel , nothing more , Val at two , three in the morning , the night 's work done , stripped down to boxer shorts , brown body bristling with goose bumps , coil-crouched sprinter style , fingers splayed , test-rocking on the balls of his feet , then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fall River Flash taking the 22o-yard low hurdles in memory , legs lithely scissoring like a ballsy ballet dancer ; cheers crashing like surf in his ears on a clear day at Memorial Field . " What 's happening ? " I had n't seen him in over two weeks . " Almost nothing , man . As they say in the Apple , the newsfrom the big anthill is not good . " He glanced up at the56 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONdues notice . " These death assessments are killing me . Too many cats keeling . Can you spare a dime ? " I got out my wallet again and gave him a ten , which is what he meant . " Gracias . I 'll get this back to you one day , never fear . How 's work with Jelly Ass ? " " Pretty good . Four , five nights a week . The fault , as they say , lies in the quality . " " I 'm hip . " I waited for him to get through at the window . " I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see what I can do . But he still remembers you fallingon your face in Burlingame . " " That I did . A very bad scene . I got three nights this week at an after-hours joint on O'Farrell , but , Jesus , they pay so bad ... " " Careful . " I drew him away from the treasurer 's window ; scabbing is a two-bill fine . " And the only way I got the gig was telling them I sang . Things are really bad , man , I kid you not . " I could n't help smiling , remembering Val 's occasional vocals with the quartet . When a sophisticated reference in the lyric did n't make sense to him , he 'd change it to a loose phonetic parallel .

Her name was Mildred  --  or Marion , pianist-singer in a Geary Street bar lounge . With tips and hustling on the side I 'd heard she was good for five bills a week . Val 's eyes avidly trailed her as she walked over to the treasurer 's window . " Suck , baby , " he said under his breath . " I hear she 's a lousy ball . Listen , Aura wants to see you .

" " No , man . " " Hawaiian luau . " Val shook his head decisively . " Blowing taps in a cemetery on a cold windy afternoon in Colma . " The half hour at the union , as usual , had depressed me .

I glanced through the open window and saw , aTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 59scant yard away , vis-a-vis , a face out of the caves : wild , bony , vicious ; below the raw acne-ravaged neck a grease-slick black denim jacket with the sleeves torn out .

I gunned my eight cylinders , pulled effortlessly level , then past him , catching the raw furious profile and the inchoate scream Mother fu. . . fading via the benign Doppler effect , my heart sinking as the light changed red twenty yards ahead .

With instant coordination  --  the swiftness of which I was to marvel at moments later ( like catching a singer 's embellishment in midair with an appropriate altered chord , not missing a beat )  --  I rolled up the window , catching the spit glob flush on the glass , and made a quick right turn , which you can do on a red light in this state , thank God .

At the pad , again nothing from Abby . My last two letters had come back stamped Address Unknown ; I did n't even know if she and Vinnie were still in New York .

" How you feelin ' , baby ? " she 'd always say after a set . " You feel good about what we just did ?

" That year I turned eighteen and Aura also reached , if you will , the age of consent . I was out of high school and had to occasionally ascend from the cellars to make a living , working weekend wedding receptions for legitimate union scale at the Elks and the Fish and Gun and the Italian American Social Club . That was the year , beyond the communion of the red and the black , that the smell of chicken fricassee and veal scaloppine at high noon was permanently bred into my bones . Now , twenty-some years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ; the first two undeniably for the better . I was on my way across the Bay Bridge to play a dinner party in a Piedmont mansion . At evening 's end the catering manager would very likely invite the band and the waiters and bartenders and maids to a downstairs kitchen to partake of leftover beef Bourguignon and wild rice and Beaujolais and strawberries . Long ways from the Fish and THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 73Gun Club and Chittenango Street . Aloha , Central Falls , goodbye forever , Golden Girl . I pulled up behind John Warneke under the porte-cochere and with a sinking heart watched him gather coolie hats and vari-colored cotton garments from the trunk of his car . Four hours of " Chinatown " and Flower Drum Song medleys in the offing . The butler led us through a rosestuccomausoleum of a house , along marble-floored hallways , through a baronial dining room , a pantry and kitchen ; and we were still walking . " Where are we playing , on the back porch ? " " You gentlemen will be working outside . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blowing . " John , did you know about this ? " John sadly shook his head , his shoulders seeming to sag under the weight of the fiddle and the two green and white metal music stands ( for display only , we 'd be faking tonight ) . " The area is well sheltered , " the butler said . We came out onto a wide lawn , dotted with pink-clothed tables and enclosed by tall trees festooned with Japanese lanterns . An improvised bar sat under a pagoda-roofed shelter . On a buffet table stretching one entire side of the lawn , black-uniformed maids were setting silvered vessels of Chinesefood over warming burners . The other stable members were already there : drums , tenor and accordionist Marty Aranson , whom I had n't seen since the day after he drove Hi and four other musicians fifty miles to a job on Lake Berryessa . When they arrived Marty opened the trunk of his car and pulled out his accordioncase  --  suddenly , terrifyingly light , for the case was empty . Somehow Hi had located the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roused him from bed and rented a box for twenty-five bean which later came out of Marty 's hide . The job , scheduled for ten to two , had n't gotten under way until eleven-thirty , and for days74 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONafterward if you met Marty on the street and broached the subject , his hands would tremble , he 'd lick his lips and begin to stammer inarticulately like someone in the throes of a seizure . I did n't know the tenor man but I 'd played once or twice with the drummer  --  Rocky , or Rocco , a squat swarthy little guy , five two or three , a precise but nonswingingshow drummer with thick wavy black hair and an old man 's gray seamed face though I 'm sure he was still in his early forties . This Rocco ( or Rocky ) , unbeknownst to Hi , was a heavy junkie . Hi would never have been able to conceive of one of his boys being a junkie , much less known what symptoms to look for . ( The mere mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes go round with wonder that there could be such a creature functioning in the business . ) Rocco would never fall flat on his face grinning goofily as Val had done in Burlingame , but a couple of times a year I come across him outside the union building , leaning against the wall in his threadbare blue serge coat and ill-fitting midget slacks , expressionless , pupils pin points , looking gray and leathery in the sunlight . It is a sight that can send the chill of the grave through you on a warm June day . In our oriental garb now we were another sorry sight , a motley crew of coolies ranging from Rocco , whose garment fit him like a little girl 's dress ( falling below the range of small-to-large lots in which Hi ordered his outfits ) , to Long John , a night heron out of water . I played a trial run on the spinet and  --  never mind my ears  --  did n't believe my eyes . The keys went down and stayed down like a player piano plugged out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the grass . The hammers I had struck were all cocked back against the strings as if glued there , yet the tripping mechanisms and felts all appeared in good condition . " Are you Mr. Hildebrand ? " A tall perfumed woman was leaning over me . Hi was going to have to start putting in THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 75appearances on some of these jobs if he wanted to maintain his reputation as the Meyer Davis of the Bay Area . " No . Mr. Warneke is in charge . " I pointed out John . " I do n't think this piano is going to be playable . " " Well , I 'll send my son over . That 's his department . " Less than a minute later a skinny alert-looking kid of about thirteen approached . The guests were beginning to arrive , pouring through the rear portal of the mausoleum onto the illuminated emerald lawn . " I 'm Richard . Mom says you have a problem . " " Watch . " I struck a full chord : ten more hammers shot back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The kid put his head inside and poked around the innards . " What are these metal things ? " " No idea . " " But you 're the piano player . " " Right . Not a mechanic . " It was almost farcical . Four hours on this instrument and I 'd be a broken man , chuckling quietly to myself or sobbing like a child . " I wonder if it 's being out overnight has something to do with it . " " The piano was outside all night ? " I looked down at the grass ; already the evening dew was dampening my shoes . " The guys who set up the tables and decorations moved it out yesterday afternoon . But we had a plastic cover over it . " " That would n't have helped . The dampness came from underneath and swelled the wood . It 's hopeless . " Richard 's face suddenly brightened . " Tell you what . I 'll stand here and free ' em for you . " By way of illustration he grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings . " See , now you 're back in starting position . " " You 're going to do that after every chord ? " " Well , I 'll let you play for a few bars and accumulate a backlog . " We were looking brightly , kind of crazily at each other. 76 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONYou can never tell about the kids of the affluent ; I 've met ten-year-olds who were masterful con artists . " Tell you what you can do for me first . Bring me a stiff gin with ice . " " One Beefeater over comin ' up . " I called John over and demonstrated the molasses piano . " Jesus Christ . " " Yes . " " Marty will have to carry the brunt . " " I 'm drinking this night away , John . " " Ca n't blame you . " Normally I detest accordions . Hi often uses the **25;12249;TOOLONG behind horns to get what he considers a hotel sound , meaning a slick fluid businessman's-bounce timbre , but the wheezy , labored emanation always puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hicks prancing around a sawdust floor to " Too Fat Polka . " This night I was to bless Marty and his pearl-plated box .. . A fearful night , sitting in a goddam coolie hat and peasant 's shift in fifty-degree cold ( out of range of a scattering of electric heaters strung in the poplar trees ) , shoes soaking in the damp grass , playing a bar or two , then laying out while Richard grabbed fistfuls of hammers and pulled them back in my face , announcing cheerfully each time , driving me mad , " There you go , Mr. Davey , back to starting position . " Two or three times an hour he took off to fetch me a fresh gin from the bar , John observing this traffic with increasing unease , no doubt pondering his obligatory report to Hi tomorrowand someone finking if he glossed over any indecorousexhibition on my part . But John should know by now that if I 'm going to get drunk , it will be a quiet , unostentatious , professional job . At ten-thirty a crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet capes and granny dresses  --  and asked for a boogaloo . Five-minute hiatus while we conferred with their spokesman to determine what a boogaloo was . ( Do youTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 77jump or slide or what ? How about a fast jitterbug instead ? ) Richard helpfully took the sticks out of Rocco 's hands and demonstrated , " Two quick beats on this followed by one on that , " while the pint-sized junkie drummer , who for near a quarter century had played topflight shows from the Copacabana to Winterland , contemplated the skinny wiseass kid with his mournful gray gaze . We ended up playing " Limehouse Blues " in modified rock . On my sixth gin , watching the kids prance around the lawn in their camp costumes ( at least they dressed by choice , not executive decree ! ) I thought , Jesus , the unbelievable bullshit I 'm subjecting myself to for the sake of a livelihood . I 'd be better off as a meat-market handyman sewing up ducks ' asses or that waiter carrying a tray of fresh foo yung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just doing his own thing ( to cop an odious expression ) honestly , with purpose , invulnerable to changing fashions or sabotage by the tools of his trade . Another year of Hi and coolie hats , Billy the Kid vests and molasses-brass tack pianos and I 'd be reduced to a mewling catatonic , devoid of talent , invention and balls . Which reminded me I was n't exactly performing like a Roman candle with the Pope these nights . But God , the girl was insatiable , a perpetual motion machine .

A cold clear night on a verdant roof of the city under this blazing vault , world turning slowly , massively on its axis while we study the yellow pocked behemoth , the only visiblehuman life three hippies huddled in a blanket across the8o THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONmacadam parking lot , possibly the advance contingent for some impending sunrise service .

" John wheeled , petrified . From my Ashbury pad I hear the command two and three times a day emanating from a police car winding up through the park , rousting the faggots .

" Just trying to keep the chill out of our bones , " I said lightly , inadvisedly . " With cold beer ? " " Let 's see your identification . " We produced driver 's licenses . I could tell they were being cautious because of our tuxes . The wrinkles probably did n't show , but our immaculate white shirts positively glowed in the winking rose light .

As I descended the narrow winding macadam  --  82 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONnoting , bemused , the yellow flower the hippies had affixed to my aerial  --  I thought , Jesus , what 's this town coming to ? Purportedly the last bastion of civilization in America and you ca n't even dig the moon in peace , rousted like a couple of garden-variety faggots . . .

But then , I suppose , neither do I look like a Rhode Island Jew . " Not at all . The piece you were working on this morning we thought most interesting . " " This morning ?

But why do people try to put labels on something they know nothing about ? " It 's getting harder and harder to tell these84 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONdays , " I eased him off the hook , lifting a hefty package for Pope from Utah . " Is n't that strange , we thought it sounded  --  Of course , that sort of music is n't our ( For God 's sake do n't say bag ) ...

" " That she does and I 'm in the process of putting a stop to it . " I smiled reassuringly and waved off . A familiar dulcet sound emanating from the rear of my pad as I came back in . Pope had put Fantasy LI0763 on the phono . She knew I had recorded , but I would n't myselfhave suggested she play the albums . Modesty forbade , along with some unease concerning their reception . My apprehensionwas warranted . " God , what hokey titles . " She was reading the liner notes . " Which ones specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep Me Warm .

" I bellowed at the stalled line of cars , laying into the horn . The Pope was staring at me in consternation . I found a parking spot in front of Marguerite 's Eatery and we crossed Fillmore to the theater . Adults $2.00 , the box office sign said , Children ( under 16 ) $1.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pope said behind me . Last week we 'd successfully pulled it off at the planetarium and the de Young Museum . It was n't the money , you understand , just an innocuous dig at the establishment . " Adult and one child , " I said to the woman . " Is your daughter under sixteen ? " That hurt a bit . Brasshairedold bag craning her neck to get a glimpse of the Pope tucked in behind the van , reassuringly patting my ass . " She 'll be sixteen this summer . On Bastille Day , if you can believe that . " She did n't , not for a minute , but kids were pressing into line behind us , show time was imminent and I was standing ground , steadfastly holding her gaze . I could see the circuits blowing behind the pale lifeless eyes , frantically weighing a time-consuming call to the manager against the projectionist 's schedule . Cries of , " Let 's go , let 's go ! . . . " audible now from the restless rear echelons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue . " Way to go , " Pope whispered , falling in beside me . The flicks , I must admit , were n't too bad ; sound track aside . Hard Day 's Night had a lot of wild invention and pace but after forty-five minutes of Help ! the cumulative decibels began to fissure my skull like a jackhammer biting into macadam . I told Pope I was going to the lobby for a drink . The mingled aroma of orange crush and rancid popcorn propelled me straight out the door and across the way to Marguerite 's Eatery . Photographs of Huey Newton , Bobby Seale and other prominent Panthers in the window dom-90 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONinteed by a familiar sad bent-head portrait of the Reverend King . " Coffee , " I said to the aged mulatto woman behind the counter , thinking of Pope sitting alone , piqued at my dropping out on her precious Liverpool millionaires .

I turned and looked into a stark gleaming youthful face sculpted out of black stone . Black as the ace of spades , my dear old mom would have reiterated . Dark beret and immaculate cobalt-blue jump suit ; the deep unblinking eyes of a demonic Jesus Christ . " Do n't say a word to me , man . " " I did n't intend to . " You 're in the Fillmore , I reminded myself ; in a quiet reasonably clean luncheonette on a bright blue May afternoon , but you 're in the Fillmore . " You killed my fathuh and raped my mothuh . " " C'm on now , Clarence , " the old woman soothed . " You dead wrong , man . " ( Ease into the vernacular , laze the voice . ) " I 'm as sorry about King as you . And as a jazz player ( establish yourself , keep it light ) I 'm for Dizzy for President . " True enough but an inadvisable overture at the moment . A rigid pink palm came down hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer and over . " Do n't talk . Do not address me , pig . " A huge spectacled moon-faced black wandered over from one of the pinball machines . " Keep your cool , Clarence , the man 's just havin ' coffee . " " Faggot ass honkie condescending to me , talking to me like a fucking soul brother . " Clarence was on his feet , a wrathful Jesus Christ in a catatonic pose . " Oh , now , stop with that jive , " the big spade said mildly , but not moving to intervene . Time to trot my little red body out of here . I dropped a quarter on the counter and walked carefully , loosely , if youTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 91will , on out of the eatery , manic uncool black eyes blazing a hole in my back . Started to unlock the Falcon , came to my senses and strolled across Fillmore back into the theater , gratefully recognized by the ticket taker , a leisurely nod for the gentleman . The pinwheel jangle of guitars struck my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you ? " " Marguerite 's Eatery . Where the red meets the black . " " What ? " " Tell you after . " When we emerged twenty minutes later Clarence was settled on the hood of the Falcon , not reclining against it  --  sitting flush on it , bigger than life ( no geegaw flying-horse emblem which my galvanized brain flashed fleetingly along the synapses ) , knees drawn up under chin like a brooding holy man , sculpted black head raised to the setting sun . " Who 's that on the hood ? " " Pegasus . " I took Pope 's arm , walked her around the rear of the Falcon past a trio of bloods milling in front of the eatery and unlocked the door on her side . " Get in . " Sauntered around the hood and got in on my side , cool as blowing " Stella by Starlight " in five flats , starting the motor throbbing under Clarence 's motionless cobalt-blue rump . Pope immediately got out her side . " Hey , get off the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake . " I intended to drive Clarence slowly out of the area into the nearest friendly Texaco station and , if he were still with us , attempt to depose him there . Before I could reach across the seat for Pope the massive spade who had tried to help me in the eatery emerged ; he appeared to recognize her . " How you doin ' , little lady ? " " Big Brown  --  hey . Could you ask your friend to get off our car ? " Clarence was n't moving , not a sphincter , leisurely soaking up the sun on the hot tin hood . Could that rear-pocket bulge92 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONbe a switchblade ? I raced the motor for four beats , then eased off . " Get down off the man 's car , Clarence . " The three other spades were resting idly against the eatery facade like ominous blackbirds on a telephone wire ; a mute and darkling Greek chorus . " The faggot pig was patronizing me . I wo n't be mocked , " Clarence said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you . You makin ' a stone ass of yourself . " Big Brown wrapped a bearlike arm around Clarence 's waist and dragged his blue butt across the tan hood . " You fucker , Brownie ! . . . " Writhing and squalling in Big Brown 's grasp like a colic kid , Clarence backswung the heel of one shoe , crunching into the headlight . I leaned across the seat , grabbed Pope 's arm and pulled her into the car . Big Brown came to my window , literally carrying the squalling blue boy on his hip . " You better take yourself off . I 'll try to get some bread out of him for the light . " " It 's on the house . " I pulled away and turned the first corner , not looking back . " I thought you were just going to the lobby .

" " Boy , you 're really blowing your brains lately , do you know that ? " Pope tenderly mopping the aftersweat of fear from my pale face .

" Somewhere around three in the morning I thrashed myselfawake to avoid the thin gleaming edge of Clarence 's switchblade as it slid toward my throat like a fish through a slimy pool . Someone was crouched in the gloom at the foot of the bed and by God there was something hovering about my throat . " Clarence ? " I said hoarsely . I had heard of dreams within dreams .

I 'll tell you where we should all split to  --  L.A. Except who 's got the goddam strength to start from scratch again ? " " That town 's even worse than here , honey . Bud Shank an ' Shelly an ' that clique got the studios and most o ' the decent work tied up . There 's good players clawin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant chains . " " So where do we find work ? " Val said . " I ca n't even get a gig on the goddam boats . The merchant marine wo n't issue me a card . I 'm telling you , Aura , a couple more months like this and I 'll be singing the blues like I was born and raised in a Bouron Street crib . Black or no , I 'll carve your ass five different ways . " " I believe you , baby , " Aura said , sagely nodding her head , a faint mocking smile , warming Val with those deep moony heavy-lidded eyes . " I mean I do n't need to come out of any fucking Alabama cotton field to get the feel of the nuances , you dig what I 'm trying to tell you ? " " I dig it , " Aura said , lighting a cigarette , still nodding her head , giving a wheezy chest-heaving little laugh . " Niles ? " He was shaking his empty beer can at me . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always know when Val has a heat-on ; that funny rushing intense half-caustic half-put-on way of talking , blood suffusing his face like blight ravaging a leaf . The old Fall River Flash . I felt suddenly , profoundly depressed . This was so sad , so much talent in the room ; three old friends scuffling in this white airy city of dreams , leaning into middle age . Taps in Colma ? Fleetingly I pictured myself stooped from the weight of a bulging suitcase , a wasted Willy Loman , lugging my electric piano up the marble steps of a Pacific Heights town house ; or strapped into an accordion , the leather laying into my back like a horse 's crupper while blue-gowned dowagers danced " Rain Rain Polka " on a luxuriant greensward under deep glittering skies ( would this be the ultimate reaction to rock , pendulum swinging too far back ? )  --  the loony vision98 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONabruptly blown to pieces by a whistle blast from the other side of the wall . Aura 's bulk quivered like a badly plucked E string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gettin ' raided , Niles ? " I explained about Pope and the Fish . " Guess where my one gig is this week , " Val said , returning , deftly punching holes in two fresh cans held in the crook of his arm . " Daly City crematorium , " I ventured . " Candlestick Park . In the aisles between innings , that is . Four-piece Rampart Street marching band in full parade regalia . I 'm renting a cornet for this memorable occasion . Of course you all know the difference between a cornet and a trumpet . " Muggsy Spanier had told that story thirty years ago , but I let Val get it off : " You can carry more dirty laundry in a trumpet case . Here 's to the wops , the hebes and the spades , " he said , raising a beer can to us , " without which  --  whom there 'd be no show biz . " Ten minutes later we piled into the front seat of the Falcon . " How you feelin ' , baby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' OK . How you feelin ' ? " " I do believe Aura got the openin' ' - night shakes . " " You and Helen Hayes . I wish we were doing Snow . " " I just ai n't got the range for that tune any more , Niles . " She heaved a wheezing sigh . " One more wrinkle in old Beck'sback . " Val drank off the last of the cans  --  " Good to the last blub , " he said , " that 's crossword for drop "  --  and flung it out the window ; it went clattering down Ashbury toward Haight to join the proliferating refuse in that luxuriant wasteland . He wrapped both arms tight around Aura . " Next week the Copa for you , baby . " " Or East St. Louis Toodle-oo , " Aura said , and with a shiver of foreboding I remembered the gloom-filled bar onTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 99East Fifty-fourth Street thirteen years back , Abby stricken , desolate , What do we do now ? Back to East Toledo ? What ? ... Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enrico Banducci , said after the third tune . No encore ; an ominous sign . The audition had n't gone badly , no glaring inadequacies , but Aura had sounded tired . Her voice , never pure , always slightly off the center of the note , had slipped too far a few times like a fine resonant old piano no longer able to hold a tuning . Too many cigarettes over the years , too much distancebetween engagements . Intelligence and heart sound , instrument failing . " Be sure and leave your address and phone at the bar , " Banducci was saying ; and to me , " Could you stick around for a few minutes ? " " I do n't believe I made it , " Aura said as we went into the bar . " I thought you were a gas . Lilac Wine ' got me right here , " Val said , clutching his groin . " Operation a success , patient bombed , " Aura said . On the chocolate-covered wall over the bar mirror , pastelchalklettering announced : NOW  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showroom and motioned me to his office . " Are you engaged for tonight ? My pianist will work if he has to but two hours ago he sounded like he belonged in an oxygen tent .

Flo had dropped word several days ago that she was trying to rent head mirrors and surgical masks for the band . " I 'm working but I may be able to get a sub .

" Banducci , a volatile 22o-pound bon vivant and legend about town  --  he has been known to bellow like a maddened bull at employees and minutes later kiss little children unbidden in the street  --  was attired in his perennial dark beret , turtleneck and fire-red sweater . " What did you think of Aura Philips ? " " I loved her . That marvelous face , the style , the material . Three years ago I would have hired her , given her the run of the place , let her work out for however long it took to sharpen an indisputable talent . But the business has changed and keeps changing . I 'm not even sure myself what 's hap-pening . " In the bar I told Val and Aura I 'd be staying and gave them my car keys . " Stop by my place .

" Mmm-hmm , East St. Louis Toodle-oo , " she said softly , stubbing out her cigarette , and I thought , Damn , she auditions and I get the gig  --  and do n't need it . SHOW TIME " You sweetheart ! I adore you ! " Santos the bass playerTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION IOIwhispered fiercely to Angela Marcello , a mantillaed youthful Anna Magnani waiting just offstage beside us for her introduction . The house was pitch dark . " Ladies and gentlemen , the hungry i takes pleasure  --  " the control booth announcement began and broke off . Somethingstrange was going on in the booth . Through the lighted observation window I saw a small wild-eyed man seize the microphone from the announcer .

I saw Banducci poke his head through the rear door , glance briefly toward the control booth and withdraw , chuckling to himself . " I 'm tightening up , " Angela Marcello said in an agonized voice , massaging her stretched throat with tensed fingers . " Do Chiove ' second . " " You little darling !

Juan counted off and I swung into the four-bar intro ; Miss Marcello , smiling blindly into the bright smoky glare , clasped her hands behind her and drew a calming breath .. . " Non dimenticarthe t'ho voluto tanto bene ... " The folk-singing duo Colin &; Heather followed in the middle slot and after playing them on , Juan , Santos and I adjourned to the bar . Already a line was beginning to form for the second show . I asked Juan and Santos if they wanted a drink . " No , gracias . " " No , nombre . No tomo . " I ordered a gin and tonic ) listening to the steady thumpingof a ragtime pianist 's foot in the Hotsy Totsy Club overhead . " Que tal , muchachos ? " Banducci said , approaching . " Bien . " " La misma cosa . " " You gentlemen might be interested to know that Mr. Sinatra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paisano . " Angela Marcello in a spangled house dress came down the bar scowling . " Enrico , you 've got to keep that maniac out of the control booth and the dressing room . He 's driving me bananas . " Banducci affably wrapped her in a huge paisano hug . " Jesus , come on now . . . " annoyed , struggling out of his grasp . . . " I get pushed around in this joint like a thirdratetank-town act . " She strode away , mad . " Come back here , you dumb dago broad ! " Banducci bellowed , stalking her down the length of the bar , the lineof patrons ' heads turning as if in the wake of a fire truck . " May I have a taste , please ? " Juan said , intercepting myI04 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONgin and tonic . He sipped tentatively , reflected , eyes roaming , then in a twinkling downed it whole , banging the empty glass down solidly on the bar , with authority . " Delicious . " He picked up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carefully and began to pick his teeth . A portly white-haired gentleman stopped beside us . " Excuse me , where is the rest room ? " Santos pointed to the far corner of the bar . " Bet you this he does , Raymond , " Juan said to the bartender , waving my truncated dollar bill . Raymond nodded and I followed their collective gaze as the old gent advanced on the sign MEN painted high on the far corner wall  --  this sign , I noticed , referring to a door directly to the left on the adjoining wall . Arriving at the marked wall he walked virtually into it , one hand scrabbling waist-high , feeling for a nonexistent doorknob . Juan began chuckling as the old boy kicked gingerly at the base of the wall . Now a waiter approached , tapped him on the shoulder and directed him a short ninety-degree turn to the left . Juan tucked the mutilated bill in my coat pocket . Pope had to see this  --  not just my south-of-the-border compafieros and their Jacques Tad routines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge pay phone , slapping the saliva-damp corner of the bill into my hand  --  " Be my guest , amigo "  --  and I phoned the Electron Zone , leaving word for her to come down when she finished work . When I returned , two waitresses from a neighborhood Gay Nineties emporium were sitting beside Juan and Santos , open coats draped over their shoulders , partially covering the blacknetstocking and satin corselets ; each had a wad of bills wound tightly around a forefinger . " Como estan , mufiequitas ? " Santos said . They paid him no mind , ordering bourbon and sodas from Raymond . " Quierefl cojer ? " THE ELECTRIC COTILLION I05 " He 's asking them if they want to screw , do the thing , " Juan whispered in my ear . " Another time , sweetie , " one of the girls said , looking straight ahead , giving no indication whether or not she had comprehended the proposition . They swallowed down their drinks in the same time it had taken Juan to polish off mine , paid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fungula , " Santos called softly after them . I order another gin and tonic , warding off Juan 's predatory brown hand , and a few minutes later the control-booth announcer , a stooped dour-looking man past sixty I saw now , informed us that Colin &; Heather were finishing up . " Como leva , Morris ? " Santos said pleasantly . " When are you jokers going to play some decent interlude music ? All I hear is the same old crap , " he said and continued past us through the front entrance to the Showroom . " He ca n't stand jazz , " Juan told me . " Keeps asking for tunes from Finian 's Rainbow and Garrick Gaieties . He had a bit part in the Gaieties around 1926 . " We trooped into the Showroom after Morris , the Three Muchachos . The lights dimmed , we faded out the blues and brought on Milo Meltzer with an up-tempo , " Lot of Livin ' to Do . " Fat and familiar-looking in checkered suit and straw boater , Milo bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of overhead lights came up bright . " Uh , buenos noches , uh , Cantinflas , Carmen Caballero , " he greeted Juan and Santos , " arrivederci Tijuana . . . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , great to be back in the metropolis . I have forty-five minutes to do , these lights are very good for my asthma . . . " My confederates had abandoned their axes and were movingoffstage . " What 's happening ? " Io6 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " It 's all yours , " Juan whispered . " Start Mother Machree ' and keep going no matter what . " " If he sits too hard on you , " Santos said in the other ear , " kick him in the shins and run like hell . " " ... I 'd like you to meet my very good friend and accompanist  --  What 's your name , sonny ?

The tune he 's playing is Mother Machree , ' and she certainly was . . . Smile , sonny boy , or you wo n't get any S-P-E-E-D after the show . . . " I was beginning to see what Santos meant . It was going to be a slow forty-five minutes under the arcs . " Either you 've got two bald-headed men concealed down there , madam "  --  to a naked-shouldered matron in the front row  --  " or the basketball season is early this year . " This guy not only looked like Jack E. Leonard , he was copping his stuff left and right . The audience was n't going for it , they were n't even warm yet . He wheeled back on me . " You would n't guess it looking at him , but my fine- feathered friend with the flat fingers here , Jose Iturbi , Jr. , studied at the conservatory in Paris for four years and another two at , uh , first-rate institutions in Copenhagen and Bremen which explains why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn thing about American music . What key are you in , sonny ? " " E fla  --  " " Next time I talk to you , SHUT UP ! " A scattering of yocks from the psychopaths in the rear rows . Now I began to sweat in earnest , fully comprehending that for three quarters of an hour I was meant to function as a sounding board , subtly resonant and preferably inani- mate ; a mute Laurel to Meltzer 's Hardy . To twenty-five choruses of " Mother Machree " ( and she certainly was ) . " ... Seriously , this boy is one of the best accompanists in the country , but when he 's in the city something seems to go wrong . " My kingdom for a stiff gin on ice . I prayed Pope would n't show up . This was infinitely worse than the surgical maskheadmirror masquerade at St. Joseph 's . Talk about vulner-ability- " Pardon me , junior , but would you mind standing ? I think your piano stool is out of tune ... " Hang on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed house  --  trying to escape the heavy hand and horn-rims  --  I noticed Sinatra in the third row , center . For the briefest moment our glances met and I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in those hard show-wise eyes. " ... the misfortune of spending last Sunday in Oakland . Oakland on Sunday . Dubuque is St. Tropez compared to Oakland on Sunday . . . " He was bucking a barely tepid audience , garnering minimum yocks . " . . Either grease up your piano stool , sonny , or I 'm going to step all over those fat little fingers . . . " Kick him in the shins and run like hell . " You 're in trouble , Milo , " Sinatra called out amiably  --  as amiably as one trouper can so apprize another . " I 'm not in trouble  --  you 're in trouble ! Put your teeth back in , and get the hell out of here ! . . . Tea for Two , ' two choruses , stop-time second , " Milo said sotto voce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing transformation took place . The porky man suddenly feather-light on his feet , moving trimly in a classic soft-shoe , straw boater pinwheeling on one finger , soles softly swishing the planks . The audience , attuned to the razor satire of Sahl , Corey , Bruce , et al , would n't accept the burleyhouse patter but this they took to , fat-man vaudevillianabruptly , astonishingly graceful , a nonpansy ballet dancer , in two brief choruses evoking a half century 's nostalgia , Eddie Foy and Bojangles , Pocatello to the Palace . Io8 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " We will raise a family , " he sang , belting it with moxie and tuneful pipes , not even puffing , " a boy for you and a girl for me  --  Going home ! " he roared and we took it out , pulling all stops , as they say , bagging redeeming boffolas and applause on the bowoff . I left by the side exit , soaked to the skin , and Milo met me in the bar . " You do n't mind those bits I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To tell you the honest truth , yes , " I said , trying to smile away the overt antagonism as I moved to accept his handshake . He recoiled as if I were proffering a dead snake . " Do n't touch me , I 'm big time  --  " and the next instant half my cheek was between a pudgy thumb and forefinger and he was tweaking hard , like a Jewish mother kitzelling a five-year-old . " Could n't you smile a little more up there , meshuggener ? Let 's have a drink . " We joined Juan and Santos at the bar . " You play damn fine banjo , kid , " Milo said to Juan . " Como , hombre , that 's like telling Dizzy he blows good bugle . " Our drinks came and I reached for my wallet . " Put your goddam money away , I make a quarter of a million dollars a year , " Milo said . " Be realistic , for Christ 's sake .

" We trooped back into the Showroom , leaving Milo signingTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION I09an autograph , advising the recipient , " Hang onto this , Clem . By 1972 it 'll be worth a cool million . " Angela , in a nervous funk , made a last-second switch , replacing her second-show opener " Ciao Ciao Bambino " ( designated " Eat Eat Babe Ruth " by Santos ) with " Nancy with the Laughing Face , " a 19405 ballad composed for Sinatra 's daughter .

" I saw Banducci , grim-faced this time , stridingdown the far aisle ; he barreled into the booth , momentarilydisappeared from sight and emerged holding the loony little guy by the coat collar and pants belt , bum's-rushing him bodily back down the aisle through the rear exit . Morris ' voice blared in triumph over the speakers , " At last we get rid of the creep from outer space ! " In the resultant bedlam  --  hungry i regulars convulsing , helpless in their seats , tourists wondering what manner of madhouse they had wandered into  --  Angela Marcello backed unheeled out of the single blue spot and leaned heavily against the piano , her face a chalk mask . " Gesu , Giuseppe e Maria , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Pope arrived with Big Brown . I introduced them around  --  " Meet Cantinflas and his brother Carmen , " the schizoid atmosphere infectious  --  andasked Juan the procedure for getting friends into the show .

" Iw THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " No , but it 's how we work it with more than one freebie . Like Santos ' old lady and four kids last night . Bandooch is usually good about freebies but too many at one swoop , specially with a high-price act like Milo , tends to screw up his digestion . " I sat through the folk-song duo with Pope and Brownie , then left to play Milo on , warning them of my involvement in what was to follow . " Take it all in a humorous vein , " I said .

" " Did you notice I had any alternative ? " I mopped my face with an already sodden handkerchief . " I was captive , it was a locked-in Laurel and Hardy situa  --  " " It was so  --  demeaning . I mean I was embarrassed . " " Well what was I supposed to do , sleepwalk offstage ? Kick him in the shins and run ? " My questions were rhetorical .

" I went over to the bar where Juan , Santos and Raymond were making book on the outcome of heavy end-of-show traffic headed for MEN  --  on the way passing Angela talking with a cadaverous-looking gent in a houndstooth sport coat . THE ELECTRIC COTILLION III " ... you sure you 'll remember me when my agent submits my name ? " she was saying and my ears picked up the houndstooth 's retort , " That 's right , dear , that 's the best way . Submit to me and you get a booking . " " Juan , do I get paid tonight ? " " Write your address down and I 'll have Dambucci send you a check . " I scribbled it on a napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hasta luego ! " Santos bellowed , a wild bull loose in Pamplona . Pope had parked the Falcon on Pacific , rear end solidly implanted in a red zone marked Bus Stop . " Nice going , " I said , extracting the ticket from the windshield . " Just under half the night 's pay . " " Well , we spent twenty minutes trying to find a place . " I waited for her to suggest she pay the ticket , or at least split it ; no offer was forthcoming . " Where can I drop you ? " I asked Big Brown . " Fulton and Steiner if you 're headin ' that way . " I pulled out of the red zone . " How 's our mutual friend Clarence these days ? " " That nigger 's gettin ' awful sassy lately , but he 's had some bad times . " " Does he still think I raped his mother ? " Pope , sitting between us , jammed an elbow into my ribs . " Well as I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some general justification for that attitude . " We drove in silence for a few blocks . I asked Big Brown , " Do you really feel it was that demeaninga situation for me back there ? " " Well you know , it 's a gig , but it 's too bad a musician of your caliber has to be exploited in that way . " " Thanks to the rock-pop-Beatle-boogaloo revolution , all the free-form acid-dropping teenyboppers doing their thing , " I said , the sarcasm thick as sorghum . II2 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " Boy , are you salty , " Pope said . " I really ca n't agree with that view , man , " Big Brown said mildly . The light ahead turned green . In front of me a William Bendix type in a battered DeSoto stayed put . I blasted my horn at him and he stuck his arm out the window in a fuckyougesture . I lightly tapped his bumper and blasted again , really laying into it , OOGA , OOGA  --  " Stop that ! " Pope cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close on my tail , leaning sustained into his horn . I stopped fairly short and he came into my bumper with a good whack . " What the hell is  --  " " Careful , man , " Big Brown said , " he 's a mean-looking mother . " A glance at the rear-view mirror confirmed Big Brown 's appraisal . He started on the horn again . " Drive away slow and take the next corner , " Big Brown advised . I did and the idiot followed me on the turn . At the next corner he rapped into my bumper again , sporadically going at the horn . " Way to go , " Pope said . " Turn the corner , slow , " Big Brown said . Round the block we went , incensed imbecile tight on my tail , engaging bumpers solidly at every corner , red ape eyes gleaming murderously in my rear-view mirror . " You asked for it , " Pope said . " Shut up , will you . " Another two turns and Big Brown said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brace yourselves "  --  and the DeSoto rocked us forward a good six feet . Big Brown got out his side and I opened my door . " No , stay in the car . " In the mirror I watched him lean into the caveman 's window . A minute , maybe two , passed before he came back . " Let 's go . " " What did you say ? " THE ELECTRIC COTILLION I13 " That you 're a bit up tight tonight and offer your apolo-gies . " At Fulton and Steiner I let Big Brown out . Pope slid across the seat and followed him . " Where the hell are you going ? " I said . " With him . " " Now little lady , you better go on home .

" " Can you picture me carrying a fifty-pound electric pianoto a gig in a suitcase ? Stooped over like Willy Loman ? " " Who 's he ? " " You were n't really going to make it with Brownie , were you ? " I opened my eyes and looked up into the oval childfacethrough a pale tangled shower of hair , supple sculpted groove between baby nose and pouting upper lip , the tabby 's yellow eyes widening , intent on my noggin . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER I I " Uh-oh . " Pope perusing the front section of the morning Chronicle . " What . " " One of the Stones got busted again . Drugs . " " Good . " " Suck .

Hey , the primary  --  we have to vote today . " " I 'm not registered . " " Naturally . " " Why naturally . " " You 're so totally out of touch . " " Not with the things that matter , man . You show me Dizzy or Miles on the ballot and I 'll fight to get into the booth . " I put the theater page aside and got up . " I think it 's time to pay a visit on Mr. and Mrs. Auk . " Closing the door behind me , I heard Pope ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall  --  " Wonder what ever happened to Eric Starvo Galt ? " Dick Dodo answered the door . I said straight off , handing him the note , " I received this communique from our mutual landlord and wondered whether there might have been a mistake  --  that it might haveI16 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONbeen meant for you , as I 've had no visitors that fall into the foreign extraction category . " " Well , we have n't had any guests that fit that description either . " He smiled his barefoot-boy smile , but the eyes , I saw now , were flat and empty , nothing in them or behind them ; the pale cerulean shade of Aqua Velva Blue Ice . " Two friends visited me yesterday afternoon , a thirdgenerationItalian and a black . If they 're foreign then so are the Seminole Indians . " Dick 's smile faded a jot , then bloomed again , painfully bright in response to my labored analogy . Marjorie now materialized solidly behind him , a really impressive bulwark , wiping her hands on a print apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving evidence in court , " I saw a racially mixed couple enter the building yesterday and when they did n't emerge after a reasonable period , not knowing at the time they were friends of yours , I phoned Mr. Armbruster . With the hippies and other unpredictables below beginning to enter the neighborhood I thought it the sensible thing to do . " Not yet showing her pregnancy , Marjorie was actually more mannish-looking than her husband . The face , framed by a nimbus of dry wheat-colored hair , was squareset , going to flesh , from the bridge of the nose down reminding me graphically of someone I 'd very recently seen . " There 's a law on the state books , " I pointed out , " that prohibits discrimination in apartment buildings of four units or more , " trying to remember whether the damn thing had been vetoed by Reagan or declared unconstitutional or what . " I said , I did n't know they were friends of yours , " Marjoriesaid quietly but with considerable virulence , and it struck me that Dick need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis-a-vis with Marge and the hippies would go streaming gladly back down the hill . " Then how did the note get pinned to my door ? " Dick intervened , " Sorry if we caused you any discomfort . In any event it will all likely be settled at the polls today , " THE ELECTRIC COTILLION II7he added cryptically but pleasantly enough , the pale ice eyes not unfriendly , smiling steadily into the warm midmorning sun . . . Over our heads now came the hallucinatory sound of Pope barking briskly out a side window at the constipatedpup next door , " Arf , arfarfarf ... " " I would like to think my friends are free to come and go in the building without an underground call to the FBI , " I said . " To my knowledge the FBI has n't been alerted , " Dick said , smiling through . " Mr. Davey , my husband and I have lived here contentedly for eight years . Considering the barrage of noise we 've lately been subjected to , your foot stomping the floor when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record machine at all hours  --  we wo n't even discuss what 's going on between the two of you up there  --  I think we 've shown a great deal of forbearance . " From bigotry to fornication in sixty seconds flat . One more wrinkle in old Beck 's back as Aura would say . " My personal life and that of Miss Jarman 's are none of your bloody business , Mrs. Auk . " " What ? " " Arf , arfarf , " overhead . " Griffin , " Dick said pleasantly . " I suggest we all be a little more considerate of one another . No calls to the FBI , no recriminations . . . " he murmured affably , soothingly , now stepping back , smiling all the while , and as it suddenly came to me where I had seen the lower half of Marjorie 's face  --  a blowup of Hubert Humphrey in the Chronicle ten minutes ago  --  the door closed ever so gently in my face . Pope said when I got upstairs , " Your phone rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " June 8 Peninsula Golf and Country Club 9-I bathing suit under tuxI18 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " What 's this bathing suit under tux ? " " I do n't know . He said for you to wear a bathing suit under your tux . " " You 're putting me on . " " That 's what I said to him . I said is this some kind of puton , Mr. Hildebrand ? He said , Of course not . ' I said is the band playing in a fishpond or something ? He said , Just give him the message . " I dialed Hi 's number . " How did you make out with the Dodos ? " Pope said . " No contest . Dick and Hubert ganged up on me . " " Hubert who ? " .. Flo , it 's Niles . Let me speak to Hi a minute . " Strains of " Begin the Beguine " drifting gently down from Colvin and Ridgeway 's aerie . I wondered if Dick and Hube had any inkling of what the boys were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the stairs . Not likely . They could spot a spade at a hundred paces in a summer night 's fog but the gossamer emanations from the closet queens would elude them . Too far beyond their pale of experience . No prancing pansies in Midland , S.D ... . " What 's cooking , Dad ? " " What 's this about a bathing suit at the Peninsula Golf and Country ? " " The party has a Greco-Roman theme . After the first set you guys will change into crepe togas in the locker room . It 's all arranged . " " Nothing doing . " " What ? " " Have n't you anything else that night ? " " Strolling job in Belvedere . Requires accordion . " " Hi , I 'm not changing into a toga in a locker room . " " Well , Dad , it 's as simple as this .

" " There was nothing in the guarantee that said I have to come on like a freak in a sideshow . " " I do n't see it that way at all , Dad . You 're attacking my whole philosophy of business . " The fetid aroma of Pope 's second helping of tuna and noodles wafted across to me . " By the way , the sub you sent to St. Joseph 's Hospital last night did n't work out . " " Why not ? Dave Breslin 's an excellent player . " " Maybe in your book . Brooks Toler said he sounded like a hopped-up Erroll Garner . " " Is that bad ?

" You 're not going to cop out on this job too , are you ? " " No , fags do n't bother me . I do n't mind any job , Hi , solong as I can keep my clothes on and do n't have to comeon like a trained seal . " " You better keep your clothes on tonight , sweetie , oryou 'll find someone 's woo-woo stick up your giggy . " I pictured Hi 's fat hand kneading Flo 's shoulder . " Anything else ?

" What was that about togas and fags ? " Pope said . " Couple more wrinkles in old Beck 's back . " The display of finery at Centurion Hall was positively glittering . They came as French Empire courtiers , burnoosed Valentinos , rouge-cheeked toy soldiers in white cord piping , Gainsborough 's Blue Boy , a threesome in blackface depicting Pearl Bailey ( brocaded satin ) and entourage ( top hat , white tie and tails ) ; those in distaff-side queen drag sported Valkyrianheadgear , floppy Garbo hats , ostrich plumes and peacock feathers , decollete chiffon , silk and velvet gowns , cleavage simulated by cruelly overlapping folds of chest skin  --  this so soon after dinner , before the first gin . A florid banner flutteringfrom a rear balcony said Rudy for Empress ' 68 . " Jesus , what is this ? " John Warneke said , setting down his bass . " Did n't Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " " They 're all guys ? " " Every last bugger . " " Hard to believe . " " Half these bitches look like they shit butter brickle ice cream , " Val said happily . Brooks Toler , who would be subleading , arrived with appropriatemusic culled from Hi 's library : " The Man That Got Away , " " Miss Otis Regrets , " " Have You Met Miss Jones , " " You 're My Guy , " " Dearly Beloved , " " Mad About the Boy , " " Experiment " ( from the London-produced Cole Porter musicalNymph Errant ) . . . and the Adelphi Society anthem , " My Lady Loves to Dance , " which we were to open each set with ( Life is a gay thing , plaything , hip hooray thing ) . THE ELECTRIC COTILLION I2IMost of the music bore the arranger 's tempo notation Brite 2 Boom Chick . By the end of the first set a tangy effluvium was drifting up to the bandstand : like a gallon of French perfume spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the mike and we threaded our way through the teeming menagerie toward the bar . " Let 's tank up fast , " Val said . " I 'm your keeper tonight , man , go easy . " Except for a pretty head turning here and there scarcely any attention was paid us . " I have to go to the john , " John said plaintively . " Good luck . " " Try not to take it out of your pants , man . " In the close-picked bar the perfume-sweat effluent was decidedly rank . We ordered drinks and the bartender , a massive balding stud in sea-dog striped turtleneck and white bell-bottoms , deftly flicked our money back to us . " On the house , dearies . " Well it takes a minority group to treat you as an equal . " Dig the conversation , " Val said to me . Indeed my ears were starting to prick up at snatches of dialogue all around us . " . . . Well dear , if you want my opinion Rafferty is an utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch showing box " . . . " Honey bunch , when you see her , as Larry Hart said , you wo n't believe your eyes " . . . " Then he asked me if I were fruit and I said , no , cocksucker . Like he could reel out twelve screaming inches and it would n't mean feathers to me , but you know , if he has eyes to turn over " . . . " Now what do you think of a silly cunt who would write Eric Starvo Galt was here on the hood of my Jag . In paint ! ... " John came back from the john looking shaken . " It was rough in there . " I22 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " Another scotch here , " Val called to the bartender , " and a double for the bass player . " I was watching a small plump moon-faced man in eighteenth-centurysatin breeches , Regency jacket and frilled silk shirt making unsuccessful overtures to every youngish queen he spotted . " May I purchase you a drink ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? " Some simply grimaced and shook their heads , others ignored him completely . Now his eye caught mine . " How about you , sir ? " " Still coasting on this . " " You 're the boys in the band , are n't you ? I 've been listening to you very carefully , to your style specifically , which is a combination of my two favorites , Frankie Carle and Roger Williams . " His glance caressingly rose the length of John . " My , are n't you a big sturdy one . " " Who 're you supposed to be , man ? " John asked politely . " Well , you might say Louis Quatorze if you were so in-clined . " Brooks came in from the main room . " We 're due back , guys . " " Party poop , " Louis scolded . Midway through the second set , two dancing queens waved up at me . It took me a few seconds to recognize Colvin and Ridgeway , one spanking bright in Marine dress blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads  --  and simultaneously I remembered why Adelphi Society had rung one of those bells : a return address on their incomingmail . I nodded ever so slightly as they careened by the bandstand in a 19305 two-step . The crowning humiliation : hiring out my services for the pleasures of the third-floor campfire girls . Thank God the Down Beat editors were n't witness to this ; in the words of Larry Hart , they would n't believe their eyes . Val was playing " Bill , " hoking it up with an outrageous hand-shake vibrato over the drummer 's rick-atickLombardo two-beat , the queens loving it . THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 123His form and face , his manly grace .. . Amid this gaudy cabaret revelry , the total absence of balls in the hall , I slipped into a blue funk , focusing my mind 's eye on the Mormon Pope and the Bobbsey twins awaiting me several hours hence . This night I was really going to need her . Our next break Val started belting down scotch in earnest , doubles over ice sans mixer , intermittently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and washing the bloody things down with straight booze . " Val , Jesus , take it easy . " " I just need a slight heat-on to get me through midnight , then I 'll coast . Goddam Sam , it smells like a girls ' field hockey team in here . A punkah is what we need . Listen Niles , John and I were talking yesterday  --  what we ought to do is get a group together . You  --  " " And how are the boys in the band doing ? " Louis Quatorzesidled up , moon face glistening with perspiration , paint beginning to run from his small round eyes . " Get lost , man , we 're talking business . You , me , John and a drummer . Aura on vocals . We rehearse steady for a week , work up a dozen or so head arrangements . Christ , we 're in the discographies , we 've got the credentials , I 'm sure Gleason and the Examiner columnist would come through with publicity . Then we go for a booking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I thought of Providence and Mr. Boston gin , of a wake of half-empty clubs along the Hartford , New Haven , Albanyand Lackawanna lines , Val at two in the morning chargingdown the motel walkways on pure grain fuel , 1957 Down Beat poll and eight choruses of " In a Mellotone " at Newport ; I thought  --  the memories tangled , fusing in a space of seconds  --  of Noelle Easter ( Mr. Niles Davey at the piano ) and then of Hi 's pink face and fat ass and coolie hats and Gay Nineties124 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONvests and donning crepe-paper togas in country club locker rooms . " I think it might be worth a try . " " Let 's do it , man  --  I 'm sick of this bullshit ! " Blood pumpinghigh in his face , Val effusively signaled the bartender . " Aura and I could do some novelty vocals  --  you know , take the curse off with a few commercial turns . It 'll be like old times , Niles ! " And I thought , That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to freshen that for you ? " " I 'm all set . " " Stop sucking around , man , or you 'll get this right in the phiz , " Val said . " Love it , " Louis smirked , taking a dainty mincing ballet step forward with his satin-sheathed right foot . " If you boys are unengaged later , why not drop over to my place for nightcaps and a moonlight skinny dip . " Val held his fresh drink flush over Louis ' balding poll . " One more word , you pint-sized pansy . " Louis turned suddenly petulant , mouth crimping , curling down at the corners . " You 're so brave , you with the big basket . I 'll bet you twenty-five dollars you would n't dare walk into the water at Ocean Beach after the ball . " " Let 's go , guys . " Brooks a meticulous timekeeper , faithfullyfollowing Hi 's instructions  --  one ten-minute break per hour , no more , no less . Val carried his drink back to the stand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " " Taking an uncultivated guess , I 'd say scrotum . " " Really ? That 's wild . " Val grinned loosely . " Aura 's hung up on that particular area too , only she puts it  --  couches it so t'speak  --  in more ana-tomical terms . " He slammed me exuberantly on the back . " You dig what I 'm tryin ' to tell you ? " " I dig . " Val 's heat-on began to make itself palpably felt now as heTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION I25left four bars out of the bridge of " Dancing on the Ceiling , " wandered into another key on the last eight of " Tip Toe thru the Tulips . " I glanced over at Brooks to see how he was reacting to the lapses  --  certainly the clientele was oblivious , Colvin and Ridgeway two-stepping by again , flapping their wrists at me , Mother Machree and Private Marion Hargrove Hi there you silly-ass prancing faggots pulling out all stops and opening the closet door wide now that they were parading on their own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Brooks is a good head and normally would let it ride if it were n't for Hi 's previously mentioned habit of cunningly buzzing sidemen a day or two later ( " How 'd the Centurion Hall job go Tuesday ? Val play OK ? " ) . And if Brooks ' report did n't jibe with whatever intelligence Hi picked up on , he 'd find himself on the proverbial shit list for fair . Next break , our last , I gave up watchdogging Val  --  Carrie Nation leading a contingent from the Alcoholic Beverage Control would n't have helped  --  and proceeded to get stoned with him . This evening was by the boards , it did n't matter any more , we were swimming in a murky sea of painted eyes and bitchy-coquet voices , a choking miasma of Chaneltingedqueen sweat emanating from hot satin and velvet ( God willing , I 'll fuck ' em all ! ) ; if Brooks was going to fink he was going to fink .

Playing music , man ! . . . The final set was given over to a grand parade of the contestants to choose the prize-winning costume ( Empress for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks of the evening winging tunes , trying to match a few bars ( snatches , if you will ) to each contestant 's appearance or style of promenade . The winner was a prodigious brute in glittering Barbary Coast drag : thigh-high cream suede boots over rose velour pants , trim puce jerkin and rhinestone-studded eye patch . Called on  --  beseeched  --  to perform , he sang an incongruous ditty in arch , Rex Harrison recitativeAny ice today , lady ? It 's a nice day , ladyHow about a little piece today ?

" " It 's not worth it , " I said . " Twenty-five tax-free bean ?

" The pigeon-plump little chap extracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese fan in front of Val 's nose . " Two conditions . You bring a towel and a fifth of scotch . " " Done and done , " Louis said , moon face quivering in anticipation . " Meet you opposite Playland in fifteen , " he cried and broke into a little boy 's skipping run for the exit , a porky balding Little Lord Fauntleroy . " You better be there , you screaming faggot ! " Val shouted after him , causing a queenly stir and flutter in the slowly emptying bar . John came in , patrons skittishly parting before his big bass fiddle . " Icarus is supposed to be visible tonight . Anyone want to go to the park ? " " We got an after-hours gig , " Val said . " Playland-at-the-Beach . " I explained the particulars . " I 'd rather blow tuba on a five-mile parade in a pouringI28 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONrain , " John said . " Either of you guys at the Peninsula Golf and Country Saturday ? " " I 'm nowhere Saturday , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You know about the bathing suit under the tux ? " John nodded soberly , dolefully ; I thought of that long spindly body encased in a crepe toga reaching , optimistically , to hairy mid-shin and swallowed down half my gin . The beach was cold and deserted . A hard current pulled southward , whitecaps flicking murderously , flashing like shaved ice in moonlight ; a quarter mile out a thin row of glittering silvered shards may have been back-up whitecaps or shark fins . This tiered airy alabaster city virtually surrounded by water , but no one in their right mind swims here . Day or night . We rolled our tux pants to the knees and began gathering driftwood for a fire , a stiff sobering breeze whipping spray in our faces . " You 're insane to go through with this . At least we ought to have a rope on you to hold against the undertow . " " I need the bread bad . Aura 's working mornings as a fry cook on Divisadero . " " Since when ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well if you were her , man , would you want it broadcaston network TV ? " Louis arrived five minutes later , advancing soundlessly , eerily across the sand in his high-court finery , moonbathed , an elfin satin-breeched fop out of another century intruding like a visitation on this barren wind-swept tableau . We built a ragged fire from scraps of driftwood and trashcanwrappings while Louis spread a small maroon blanket and ceremoniously arranged on it a fifth of Cutty Sark and a fringed pink and blue towel . Val wrenched the cap offTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION I29the bottle and took two strong pulls , bottom straight up like a Hollywood buccaneer , then began to undress . " Put the bread on the blanket . " " Bread ? You did n't tell me to bring  --  " " The twenty-five bean , for Christ 's sake . " " It 'll blow away . " " Put it on the goddam blanket , Louis .

" Val had stopped and was gazingout at the black ice-tipped combers , his hair blowing around his head . " You 're supposed to go in naked , " Louis called petulantly , " I thought it was understood . " Val slowly turned . " Listen , you satin-assed freak , the shorts stay on or we pack the whole thing up . " " That was the arrangement , " Louis whined . " Let 's pack up . " Val came back , reached for his pants . " Oh , go ahead and keep the fucking things on if you want . Bitch . " Val started seaward again , stopped and dropped to sprinter position , knuckles down , rocking on his toes . " You have to walk in slow until submerged ! " Louis piped . " Shut the hell up , you flaming fairy , " Val called back , twisting his head around  --  then slowly , drunkenly , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side . Cursing , he rolled back onto his knees , resumed sprinter position , test-rocked for maybe a ten count , butt high , then charged with a whoop across the sand  --  " That 's no fair ! " Louis squealed after him  --  puffing up abruptly at water 's edge . Now he waded in slowly , from that distance it appeared a leisurely stroll , and I thought I could make out the goose-tippled skin of his back . When the water reached his130 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONknees , he began wildly flapping his arms like a gull , moonspeckedfoam spraying around his shoulders . At waist level , Louis began making soft wet undefinable noises beside me and I looked away , north , to Seal Rock , silvered by a millennium'saccumulation of sea-lion dung . Val re-emerged , slogging laboriously through the surf , knees pumping in half time , now sprinting across the moondrenchedbeach for dear life , kicking up geysers of sand . Teeth chattering like marbles , he wrapped himself in the towel , tearing the scotch out of Louis ' hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Val hefted the bottle , his teeth clackingagainst the neck , and took a prodigious slug . " One goddarnthing , I 'm sober again . " A cutting wind sprang up , whistling down from Seal Rock ; our pitiful driftwood fire sputtered fitfully . I tugged the bottle out of Val 's hands . " Better get dressed . " " You get your kicks , Louis ? Come in your little satin breeches ? . . . hey ? " " Shut up , Val . " " My name is Robert , " Louis said sullenly , testily . He looked bedraggled and unhappy , the silk lace shirt stained and soddenwith damp ; a lost little boy at the close of an uninspiredbirthday party . He began fretfully digging his fingers into the sand . " It was n't fair , it was supposed to be skinny dipping .

I may  --  Would you mind terribly if I had to wear bands ? " 134 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " Of course not . " " I mean like for two years . " She 'd never extrapolated that far before . What came momentarilyto mind was a lopsided football score : Davey 42 Jarman 20 . " No problem . " " You 'd get a mouthful of cold steel when you wanted to kiss me . " " Probably turn me on . " My gaze lighting on her new inspirationalplacard , a worthy mate to Rance atop the icebox chest : Parsley , Sage , Rosemary &; Thyme . " Got to go . " She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Brown 's coming over for lunch . D' you mind ? " " Not a bit of it . Have him convey my regards to Clarence 's mother and father . " In the Tonga Room of the Hotel Fairmont six gleamingluncheon tables were graced by identical floral centerpiecesfrom each of which sprouted , like a hardy perennial , a New England state flag . Hi 's arranger ( in consultation with me , sole New England-bred member of the stable and bangtailproud of it ) had written lead sheets for six songs representativeof the states . MAINE : " The Stein Song " NEW HAMPSHIRE : " New Hampshire , Our New Hampshire " ( a bland and lugubrious anthem in % time ) VERMONT : " Moonlight in Vermont " MASSACHUSETTS : " Old Cape Cod " CONNECTICUT : " Connecticut Is the Place For Me " RHODE ISLAND : " Little Rhody " The program notes read : ( I ) Star-Spangled Banner(2) Invocation(3) Address : The Honorable Mrs. John A.

As each delegationwas serenaded , its members stood , waved their little flag and received a round of applause from their sister states . Then an inexplicable thing happened . Hi gave the downbeat , we struck up " Old Cape Cod " and no one stood . The ladies at the southern-state tables were glancing in confusion at one another as if trying to ascertain which delegation was being serenaded . Massachusetts customarily follows Vermont but  --  A youngish matron from Rhode Island rose hesitantly and was yanked down by a tablemate . Hi pointed his baton at the Massachusetts contingent , indicating by a gentle upliftingmotion of the stick that mass paralysis was not a scheduled part of the program , you ladies should be standing . Baffled and flustered , the Bay Staters came slowly to their feet , frowning at the band . One began desultorily wavingthe flag . Smiling fixedly at the ladies , Hi turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the side of his mouth . " What the hell 's going on , Dad ? " " No idea . It was a big hit in the fifties . " Is Pope right , am I wigging out ? Is n't Cape Cod still in Massachusetts ? Kennedywould n't have given away three hundred miles of choice white-sand beach .. . The presentation was garnering sparse and perfunctory mitting from the assemblage . Most of the Mass. ladies were now glaring angrily at the band . " Double time  --  Let 's get through the goddam tune ! " Hi called to the horns. 136 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONThe Massachusetts ladies resumed their seats , dazed and demoralized . Hastily onward to Connecticut and Little Rhody . The odds now reduced and riding with us , these final serenades went off without mishap . Hi announced over the mike , " Luncheon is now served , " and turned to the band . " Waltz medley , Around the World , " pointing to the lead trumpet . Within seconds a covey of Bay Staters were fluttering behind him , chattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , ladies ... " " What was that awful song you played for us ? " " Old Cape Cod . ' My pianist Mr. Davey , who is from New England , assured me  --  " " We never heard of it . " " You do n't say . . . " Hi was positively beaming at the ladies , his fat face rosy with the effort . " I 'll tell you what , ladies , we 'll make it up to you by playing an entire med  --  " " We were expecting the Harvard Fight Song . " " My deepest apologies . " Disconsolate , the delegation trooped back to its table . Hi blew out his breath and turned back to the band , baton waving erratically as if with a spastic life of its own to the 3/4 strains of " True Love . " Ever so slowly his head came round to me , jowls roseate , raisin eyes glowering hotly out of creased pouches . " Nice going , Dad . I knew I could count on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our daily rehearsal . Only the drummer had n't shown . " You seen the Examiner ? " Val said . " No . " " Elwood came through for us .

TrumpeterVal Catalona and pianist Niles Davey who ran a quartetin the eastern bistros during the mid-fifties are rehearsingTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 137a new group for West Coast consumption . Both Catalona and Davey have recorded extensively and we 'll look forward to this renaissance of mainstream jazz . ' " " Makes us sound ancient , does n't it . How was the Roman toga job , John ? " " Pretty embarrassing , man . " " Who went down on his knees and whinnied like a horse ? " " Les Nunes . How did you know ? " " It made the society page . " " Jesus Christ . " Val was pouring vodka gurgling into a water glass . " Taste ? " He held the bottle up ; I shook my head . " You look awful cute in your white coat , Niles , " Aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humor man . . . If I were to play Old Cape Cod , ' " I said to John , who was from Indianapolis , " what state would you associate it with ? " " Massachusetts . " " What other tune would you play to represent the state ? " " There was Boston Beguine ' from New Faces , " Aura said . " Something more popular . " Everyone thought . " How would you react to the Harvard Fight Song ' ? " I said . John and Val gazed blankly at me , Aura 's dark heavy face turning contemplative as a faint wheezing sound escaped her . The doorbell rang , the drummer lugged in his cases and we set up . A half hour and two tunes later I brought my elbow smashing down on an octave 's worth of keys , glaring furiouslyat my old mainstream friend , unable to keep the disgust out of my voice . " Jesus Christ , Val , it 's the middle of the afternoon and you 're pouring the goddam stuff down your throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a fire ready to light in my fireplace , table set with Pope 's best china , blueI38 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONlinen napkins and candles , a bowl of yellow flowers picked in Buena Vista Park ; two thick club steaks on the kitchen counter . " I do n't need bands ! " she greeted me jubilantly . " Least not for a while . Exercises instead . Watch . " She popped a wooden tongue depressor , the kind doctors use for throat examinations , in her mouth and using the biting edge of her lower teeth as a fulcrum , prodded the uppers at a half-dozen pressure points . " Ingenious . " " Are you mad or something ? " " Just done in , beat . Run over by a tableful of old bags from Cape Cod . Sick of seeing the rebirth of mainstream jazz pickled in whisky . " " I do n't know what any of that means . " " Does n't matter . " " Shall I light the fire ? " " As an ex-junkie Zen friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you light the fire , Pope , or not light the fire . " " Well listen  --  " hands on hips , blowing out her breath in exasperation  --  " do you want to forget the whole eve-ning ? " " No . Light the fire . " I poured a gin and browsed through my LPs , coming across one I 'd forgotten I owned : Fats Waller 's Handful of Keys . I put it on , amazed at how corny the band sounded but how fresh and joyful the fat guy 's vocals came through : Gon na change my address where I 'm livin ' at Change my long tall one for a little short fatPope called in from the kitchen , " That sounds like my Uncle Larry at a Christmas party . " There 's callowness for you : the greatest Harlem rent party stomper-shouter of them all skewered in one uninformed sentence . THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 139 Nobody wants you when you 're old and gray .. . Disheartened , I let the side play out , arm retract . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in the salad and a bottle of rose . " I doubt it . " " What ? " " What do you want me to do ? " " First , stop being so salty . . . I was thinking about it last night . Would you write a letter of  --  you know , condolence , to the Kennedys ? " " Do n't be silly . " " Why 's it silly ? " " By the way , you ca n't leave the eternal flame burning while we 're both out . When I got in last night it was down to the holder , there was hot wax bubbling over the  --  " " Why 's it silly ? " " Because as a conservative guess ten to fifteen million compassionate citizens have done the same thing . " " But how many actually knew them ? You could write to Ethel and say  --  I 've already started plotting it out .. . Dear Mrs. Kennedy , I had the rare and distinct pleasure of striking up a summer friendship with your late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hyannis Port . I was greatly  --  deeply saddened . . . and so forth . And I 'll sign it too , you know , as a participating admirer . " " As another conservative guess I 'd say she has at least half a dozen secretaries handling the mail . It will never get within ten feet of her . " " Let 's do it anyway . One day she might read it . Please . " Jesus , the futility . I glanced at the fresh white candle burning between the murdered brothers , the vase of flowers changed every day now . " There 's only one trouble , however , with your opening sentence to Mrs. K. " I40 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " What ? " " I never knew either her late lamented husband or his brother . " " What d' you mean ? " " Just what I said . I played the tune for Jack and he did send over a drink , but that was the end of it . " " You said Ethel and Pierre Salinger came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack all that summer and he 'd stop and pass the time of day and he asked you to give him piano lessons !

There are secret ser  --  " " That 's what I asked you ! I said how could you just stop and speak to him like that when there were secret service men around ! " She stamped her foot , furious , the wide yelloweyes agleam with firelight , brimming with tears . " All right , so I made it up . . . " " Why ? " " I do n't know why , it was just a put-on . Jesus , ca n't you  --  " " You said he even commuted the dope sentence of a friend of yours ! " " That part happens to be true . And I can ver  --  " " You old fart ! " She grabbed a handful of tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whirled in a tangle of hair and fled down the hallway , slamming the communal door behind her . I went after her , pushed the door open and stuck my head in . She was lying face down on the bed , fists clenched in the pillow . " What about the steaks ? " " Shove ' em up your ass ! Go suck yourself ! " Neither Jack nor Bobby would have stood for that . Another downbeat close to a dismal day . No nightingales in Berkeley Square tonight . No pinch-hitting chores for tired old Joe D.CHAPTER 1 3I agreed to spend the evening at the Electron Zone . A form of expiation ; making it up to her and Jack and Bobby . " All I 'm asking is you listen with an open mind , " she said . " Maybe you 'll even like it , and then where 'll you be ? " I put on an old pair of corduroys , a newly acquired turtleneck shirt ( another concession ) and a blue visored Dutch boy cap which I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over the intervening quarter century . " How do I look ? Mod enough ? " " Like a weekend plastic freak . The cap 's ridiculous . " I left it behind , we extinguished the not-so-eternal-flame ( her concession to me ) and took off for the Tenderloin , land of the androgynous hustlers and two-buck hotel rooms . Hippies squatted like peons against the stone facade , huggingtheir shins , bare feet flat on the cold grimy pavement ; gray on gray . " He 's with me , Warren , " Pope said to the Eckstein-handsomeblack wielding a roll of tickets at the door . " Mr. Jarman ? " he said politely , offering his hand . " Davey . No relation . " We shook . " My mistake . " " No matter . " " Ah dad , poor dad , " Pope said , grinning , hugging my arm as we entered the gloomy cavernous hall . " I 'll get back to you whenever I can . Circulate around , " she said and departed142 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONfor the sandwich-soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear wall . The house group including Big Brown was already at work , blasting out into the hall . Except for Brownie and one other spade in the band most everyone was white ; no one looked over twenty-two . Leather pants , flag shirts , hair , medallions , baby faces daubed with phosphorescentteardrops and petals , microskirts , gypsy hats , wide-wale cords , bell-bottoms , hair , hair . . . A mobile but eerily silent menagerie , drummer 's back-beat clattering through their slippery ranks like artillery shot . The only conditions under which Ronald Reagan could possibly comprehendthis tableau would be if the entire assemblage were hired as extras for a carnival scene , kids in freaked-out Lotusland motley for an updated sideshow montage with Emmett Kelly , departing at day 's end with their $29.50 ( destined next morning for the school savings account ) , a good scrub and supper with Morn , Pop and Sis before hitting the algebra books . Not a chance ; these denizens were for real , as real in their way as the luminous petals and dolorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustling pop and hero sandwiches and crullers to the lookers-on ordering from flat-armed lecture chairs which ringed the dark vibrating half-full hall . Now flickering waves of colored light began pulsing out , splashing globular moonscape patterns over the walls . There a boiling Ocean of Storms , a blanched Sea of Tranquillity . . . John would go out of his mind . . . the churning Mare Spumans , a Bay of Rainbows like melting brick ice cream ... I glanced up at the second-floor balcony and saw a kid with carrot hair sticking out from his head like spokes from a wheel hub , naked to the waist , methodically passing filters across a projector lens . With the first lull in the pop-and-cullers orders , Pope sought me out , stopped a yard away and began a series of body-snapping gyrations like a spastic on a treadmill . " Come on , move . " THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 143 " What do you mean , move ? " " Like this . Just go with the beat . You 're a musician , are n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in the evening 's plans that said I had to make an ass of myself . " Grimacing , she wandered over to a doleful-looking kid with a drooping sandy mustache who was shuffling away by himself in a kind of sleepwalker 's jig , and began working out opposite him , bucking and prancing to an altered beat in little lithe coltish movements ; the somnambulant seemed totally oblivious of her . On the stand the music was crankingup ; nearing frenzy , Brownie playing with his guitar inverted , flat against the shanks and the neck standing straight up phallus-style , the other guitarist ranting unintelligibly into one of three mikes in a raw tortured voice , " Baaayeeee-yowl .. . " Something .. . Hall filling up fast now . The crush of bodies and the dankish odor  --  an old medicinal plastic smell  --  reminded me fleetingly of the Adelphi Society Costume Ball . In the weird zooming flashes of light these kids all looked putty-loose , glaze-eyed . I began to understand how they could take the decibels ; either they were chemically stoned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into oblivion  --  or another dimension . I would have gladly joined them ; escape . But whatever they were hearing  --  some soothing narcotizing voltaic roar  --  was hammering and jangling in my ears like a nightmare battery of dollar alarm clocks you can reach but ca n't shut off . I was feeling hot flashes like a fever , sweat running freely under my arms and down my chest . A silence , sudden and sepulchral  --  a seashell sound in a vast and empty cathedral as the alarm clocks shut off by remote control and Brownie 's boys lay down their hardware . Now he was announcing the visiting group , already lugging their mammoth speakers onto the stand  --  Burn , I thought he said , " Five soul brothers called Bum , " the impression con-144 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONfirmed as one of the members , stalk-thin with hair like a tangle of rusted tin foil , grabbed the mike from Brownie and said in a sly basso voice , grinning amiably , " Yeah , like fire next time , babies . " It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the teeming throng to find Brownie , spotted him at ten paces talking to Clarence and another spade I recognized from Marguerite 's Eatery , and changed tack . . . directly into the path of a trio of swaggering hoods entering by a side portal , the greasy cut-off denim jackets proclaiming them Gypsy Jokers even before I saw the backsideemblems . Altering course again , I eased behind an artist painting decals on three outstretched nymphal arms and studied the Jokers ' faces  --  one had looked ominously like the caveman expectorator from Ellis Street  --  but in the stabbing strobe lights the brutish features were indistinguishable . Where were the cops in this place ? So far I 'd seen only an undernourished Chinese kid in a baggy gray meter-maid uniform . Burn got under way , another dimension entirely , steelwiresheets of sound , turning and waving their guitars into the speakers for feedback , toy-size electric organ screeching unlovely brain-cracking chords out of the treble . The volume was fearful , crackling with static and fuzztone , it was like beng inside a monster malfunctioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your eyes . Had n't these circuit-crossed madmen ever heard of dynamics ( fortepianissimo , diminuendo-accrescendo ) ? They were mangling the music , torturing their instruments , no wonder the poor things were screaming . My mind 's eye , squeezed to a pin point in the pressure-cooker maelstrom , played an effortless trick , hallucinating a mammoth short circuit , Burn going up in crackling wires and sulphurous smoke , drums pounding on with an eerie life of their own , a big dumb disembodied beat driving rivets into my skull . . . And there was a beat , no question of it , lead-heavy , slambang , churning g-chung chugga ung , g-chung chugga ung a thousand fledgling pumpTHEELECTRIC COTILLION 145ing limbs paying voltaic obeisance , but for all the **26;12276;TOOLONG synchronized pelvic rhythms on the stand , those spades got no swing or dip at all in their playing , just surface effect , cliche modes , running over and over the same timeworn blue notes . No Charlie Christians up there among the frets and fuses , no flowering Wes Montgomerys ... Shit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hall seeking relief but there was none to be found ; the physical plant , the ricochetinghall , was the power line , it was attached to the membrane of my guts and feeding directly in . A girl who could n't have weighed more than eighty-five pounds , man 's shirt knotted tight under nonexistent breasts , jiggling up and down opposite the somnambulant whom Pope had quasimatedwith an hour earlier , seemed to be eyeing me , her glance periodically flickering my way as if in sync with the strobes . I looked away , trying to catch a glimpse of Pope or Brownie ( some kindred point of reference ) , then back again ; now the shadowed rapid-shutter eyes were fixed steadilyon me , no bones about it , even as the fleshless marionette'storso kept jiggling away as if a feeble alternating current were coursing through it . Circuit suddenly open , she stopped on a dime ( her catatonic partner still shuffling around his cell-sized square yard of floor ) , strode over  --  if you can picture eighty-five pounds striding  --  and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard wizened little purse-snatching face . " Are you a . . . " " What ? " I could n't hear over the din. " . . . you a nark ? ... " What ? . . . " " Skip it . " She strode away . I found Pope at the pop counter wiping a sticky orange mess from her tray . " I 'm splitting . " " What ? It 's only ten o'clock ! " 146 THE ELECTRIC COTILLION " I 've had it . Too piercing . " " I arranged to get off at eleven . I was going to teach you to dance . " " Could n't possibly last . " I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes . The hot flashes were coming in waves and sections of brain seemed to have torn loose , drifting and bouncing around my skull like ice crystals in a paperweight globe . " Oh boy . OK , go ahead home , you old fart . You did n't even want to try , did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . Drifting , lurching toward the exit , a victim of marsh gas making for higher ground , the swirling lunar side wall  --  congealing , shifting , melting  --  seemed all at once to run togetherand dissolve , pouring from its moorings and burying me in a roiling Sea of Tranquillity . Strawberry Fields Forever . At the pad I came down easy , filling a tumbler of cracked ice with gin and stacking all my Tatum LPs on the turntable ( deus ex machina , my patent analgesic ) , turning the volume low , letting the clear cascading notes leach the acid rock from my throat , wash the fuzztones from my ears . When she had n't come home by quarter to one , I drank off another gin and went to bed . It was some three hours later that I came stark awake for no reason , the house dark and still ; empty-feeling . Naked , shivering , I padded down the hallway to our communal door . Open . No cozy embryo shape under the blankets ; they were drawn neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull gleam of light from the law students ' window caught on the wire mesh of a fencing mask and I thought suddenly , simultaneously , of the night of the Keystone chase with the goondrivenDeSoto when she 'd wanted to leave with Big Brown Now little lady you better go on home , and a few hours ago , the neck of his guitar poking straight up  --  a sturdy mahogany phallus . CHAPTER 14Eleven the next morning was when she coolly blew in , setting down the madras tote bag , lighting the eternal flame , extracting one of the dental popsicle sticks from the cardboardcontainer and diligently setting to work on the upper choppers , all the while gazing wordlessly , dispassionately , disinterestedly at me with those wide innocent tawny eyes . I began reasonably enough , " I assume you spent the night with the two-hundred-fifty-pound spade guitar symbolic phallus . " The eyes wavered not a jot , popsicle stick moving methodicallyalong the oral arch : prod , slide , prod , slide .. . " Put the stick down , man . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afro-American , not spade . A blood , if you will . " Prod , slide . " How was it ? " Still outwardly carrot-calm . Worldly elder ( if you will ) sounding wayward bopper . She flipped the stick onto the round oak table , rummaged in her bag , came up with a pack of Pall Malls and lit one . " Since when did you start smoking ? " Only Fay Bainter and Lionel Barrymore were missing . " Now . You 're making me nervous . " She puffed and exhaledfour times in quick succession , stuck her tongue out , tasting brass , and mashed out the butt in a dish . " Where are you going ? " " To take a leak , Charlie . " 148 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONHighly seasoned Afro-American elixir Big Brown must be injecting these nights . She returned a minute later with fencing mask and foil and proceeded to work out against the poster-covered wall . At which point I suppose I should have cracked up , the elements of farce being abundantly present . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust , parry , lunge . " Listen , I ca n't make it with you any more . " Addressing me quietly , solemnly through the wire mask . " It was really that good ? " " You do n't understand , do you . " Again , I would have broken up but for a slowly calcifying knot high in the midriff . Twenty-two years on this mewling maid in the iron mask and she was patronizing me . The insufferable gall . " Try explaining , my mind 's open . " Her breath , expelled through the wire , sighed ; like the keening sound wind makes through bridge cables . " What do you expect ? You walked out on me last night . " " I was driven out . I could have adjusted to the banality of the music but the membrane lining the skull is fairly thin , you see , and  --  " " It 's not banal ! You did n't even try ! " " Try ? I was subjected to a two-hour artillery barrage . I staggered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant and on top of it got mistaken for a narcotics agent for Christ 's sake by a twelve-year-old purse-snatching lit-tle  --  " " You 're just an auk  --  a dodo !

" You and your fag clown white coat ! Broken-down saloon piano player ! " Unbelievably she took a swipe at me with the foil , I meanTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 149a good wild healthy cut ( Flynn alive and operative in Frisco ) ; I jumped back , feeling the eternal flame singe the hair on my neck just as Dick or Hubert began a genteel rapping on the ceiling underfoot , losing balance and knocking into  --  it would have to be the brother enclosed in glass : Jack toppled to the bare-wood floor and shattered to pieces . " Way to go ! Rance ! " " I 'm splitting , man . You 're a menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made it past the still quivering foil to the communal door , in my wake a screaming epithet with not a kernel of truth to it , " All jazz musicians suck !

Entering the bridge to " Small Hotel , " the phone rang . I went for it , heart hammering , a quick unbidden prickling of tears in anticipation of Pope 's voice , blue , sorry , remorseful . Tears , for heaven 's sake . At forty . Getting tangled up in this kind of anguish again after having been through it so many . . . " I 'm at the jazz Workshop . We open for a week tomorrow night .

" " You guys seem to be very intent on cutting the cord . " " Chord ? " " Umbilical . " I heard Pope 's front door slam . " That 's a pretty drastic interpretation on the basis of one fiftieth of a year . " " Tell him to call back next month . " " What ? " " I was talking to Flo . Another call . " It seemed an opportune time to test the lifeline ; nothing really to lose at this stage . See how many times you can go down and still surface .

CHAPTER 15JAll WORKSHOPTonite Thru SunCATALONA-DAVEY QUARTETAura PhilipsGood to his word , Val stayed stone sober ( and out of Bird 's grave ) for two nights . He began juicing early Thursdaybut by then it did n't matter . We played to fifty people in three nightsSLIM PICKENS AT WORKSHOPand were let go at the close of the third set on Thursday .

" Guess I 'll go on up to the park , " John said . No one was looking at anyone else . We parted without another word . East St. Lotus Toodle-oo . Three blocks distant on Kearny I found the DIZZY FOR PRESIDENT sticker half torn from my bumper : the ultimate degradation .

In mid-reverie a dual sequence of events occurred : I drove through a red light , coming to my senses some twenty feet past the intersection , and saw in the rear-view mirror , as sure as the night follows the day , the winking rose light advancing soundlessly on me . Quite mindless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisurely 15 mph , turned the next corner , shut off my lights , entered the first driveway , saw with mild disbelief  --  my first God-given break in months  --  the open yawning garage , drove in and sat in the dark in that cold cement vault with my heart pounding in my throat as I154 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONconsidered two aggravating items of evidence : DIZZY FOR PRES on my rear end ( as potentially incriminating as H. Rap Brown for D.A. ) and an open pint of gin in the glove compartment . In the mirror I watched the incarnadine light wink by ... return .. back again .. . A quarter of an hour later I backed cautiously out of the garage , tossed the gin bottle in some shrubbery ( stopping to tear at the remains of the sticker , succeeding in mutilating it past recognition ) and drove home at an abject 18 mph , circuitously , via back streets . No little Vespa outside Armbruster Towers , three days running now . No papal encyclical under my door . I phoned the Electron Zone : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy Jokers . The communal door was latched fast as it had been since Monday night . My inner eye flashed through to the cold stub of memorial wax between the beautiful brothers . Pres in his shattered glass frame . Where are they now that I need them ? I opened a fresh bottle of gin and stuck Tatum atop LII264 on the turntable ( deus cum Davey ex machina ) . That 's my Parsley , Sage , Rosemary &; Thyme . CHAPTER 16 " Flo , it 's Niles . Is Hi there ? " " Hold on . " Overhead a Colvin and Ridgeway gold-record special , a dusty diamond , stuck in one groove : Jerry Lewis braying over and over , tootsie , tootsie , tootsie .. . " He 's busy , Niles . Can I help ? " " I thought I was going to be engaged tonight and tomorrow night but my plans have changed . Hi had originally booked me for both nights . " Tin is what it tastes like ( regurgitated pride ) if anyone asks you . " Hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tootsie do n't cry .. . " We 've already hired replacements , sorry . Hi says try the hungry i . I have no idea what he means . " It took but a second to sort it out : the night I worked the i and sent a sub on Hi 's job . Were you sick or what ? Sick . Nigger in the woodpile as my dear mammy would say ; Hi 's grapevine functioning flawlessly . " I know what he means . Take care , Flo . " Which would seem to fix the latch firmly on the stable door . On the way out I heard Pope 's phone ringing again , insistently , forlornly , the third time this morning . ( Was it the156 THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONFish ?  --  desolate , deprived of his security whistle ? ) Wherever she was shacked up , I hoped she 'd remembered to take a supply of the popsicle sticks , one or two clean Cannon Cavalier towels . At the corner of Fulton and Steiner where I 'd let Big Brown off the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vespa , a minor blessing easing the stomach knot a hitch or two . But I parked and sat in a mild stupor for a good hour , watching the intersecting streets in four directions . Just rest the old noggin on the Bobbsey twins here . A peaceful corner bordering on a park , narrow two-story houses with front stoops and stone stairs , old people in the upstairs windows and the spade kids chasing each other , runningaround like wind-up dolls ; an exquisite older girl , grave and beautiful as Miriam Makeba ( sweet golden as a crown ) stoically , methodically bouncing a ball off the stone stairs . We 'll have to get a safety catch for that blunderbuss . . . I spotted Big Brown in rectangular purple shades coming out of a faded blue Victorian house , got out of the car and intercepted him . " I 'm looking for Pope . Have you by any chance seen her ? " Calm and cool as sight-reading Slaughter on Tenth Avenue , one eye on the conductor . " Not since yesterday . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just headin ' out to look for her . " " Where would you look ? " " Haight Street , possibly . " " Why there ? It 's a battlefield . " " Well , you know , it 's the place , and she 's very brought down over something . What happened with you ? " " I 'm really not sure . It started with a disagreement in taste at your hall Sunday night . You know , I 've been wanting to  --  How do you stand the volume level night after night ? You 're so close to the speakers ... No , I 'm serious . " " Well it 's here and it 's happening , man , and you just better make up your mind that 's the way it 's going . " THE ELECTRIC COTILLION 157 " She 's been staying with you until yesterday , then . " " That 's right . " How was it ? Gazing tacitly at this gentle purple-glassed spade and brother , I realized that despite Aura. , despite Diz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forebears that it hurt , hurt bad , more than it should have , and that I could hate this kindly spook easily , avidly , with all my heart . " Leave her alone , will you , Brownie ? I want her back . " " Well as I just told you , man , she 's gone . " " If you come across her , give her a message , will you ? Tell her Jack and Bobby and I need her back . " On this insane note I turned away , got back in the car and drove to the Haight-Ashbury , cruising slowly that thronged hirsute carnival route while trailing an impeccably lettered message on the rear panel of a beat-up hearse bearing Ohio plates : But for the absence of rubble and an eerie nonchalance about the habitants it looked like a bombed-out area , every other store front boarded up or guarded by padlocked steel fencing . No tabby-eyed Pope strolling in this erstwhile flowerland of thieves and heads and panhandlers . Was she behind one of the boarded-up store fronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking for a strand of sunblondhair in a rain forest . Praying Big Brown had sources of information , some access to the pads in this jungleland , I turned onto Oak and the freeway to North Beach . I looked twice at the Jazz Workshop marquee ; both times it read SCREEMIN MEEMS . Inside I asked the Chinese bartender for the money . HeIS$ THE ELECTRIC COTILLIONpeered at me inscrutably in the gloom , no gleam of recognitionin the ancient papery eyes . " Catalona-Davey Quartet , " I reminded him . " Ahhh . . . " While he poked around in the till I watched two kids whose ages could n't have totaled more than thirty-five years heft a speaker the size of a master-bedroom chest of drawers onto the stand . One of them picked up an alto sax and came back toward the bar tootling absently with a sound like an anemic frog . He asked the Chinaman for a glass of orange juice . " Bird lives again , " I said . " What ? " " Bird , Charlie Parker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at me blankly ; Bird lives and sarcasm succumbs . " You 're playing his instrument , " I explained . " I do n't follow you , man , this horn 's bought and paid for . " I accepted an unmarked envelope from the Chinaman , went to the pay phone at the end of the bar and called Mort Hannah . " It 's Niles Davey , Mort . " " Yes . How are you ? " " A bit strapped . Thought I 'd let you know I 'm a free agent as of this weekend . " " John Warneke called an hour ago . In fact you 're the third Hildebrand alumnus who 's phoned in two days . What 's going on ? " " Major umbilical cord surgery . " " Did n't I read that you and Val Catalona were going into a jazz club ? " " You did , and we did . It 's over . " " Summer 's a bad time , Niles . I 'll keep you in mind but I have all I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nonrock musicians running in and out of this office like mice . " " Mice ... " Excuse the metaphor but the market 's turned completelyTHE ELECTRIC COTILLION 159around . I may have a solo thing for you toward the end of neat week . No contract yet . You do n't play accordion , do you ? " " No . " " Too bad . Why do n't you try the cocktail lounges ? " " I 've thought about it , but I 'm not very adept at conductingcommunity singalongs . " " I know what you mean . Wait a minute ... Do you know Maple Leaf Forever ' ? " " The Canadian national anthem ? " " Yes . " " Not offhand . I probably have it in a book somewhere ... " " There 's a Canadian-American Liquor Association Conventionopening at the Jack Tar Sunday morning , nine o'clock . They want both anthems and I 'm supplying a singer from the Civic Light Opera so all you 'll have to do is accompany her . It pays twenty for about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Too fast ; a house cat pouncing on a string . " I have n't even tried my own boys yet , but I doubt if I could rouse anyone at that hour . It 's the International Room , second floor , Jack Tar . Dark suit , dark four-in-hand . Pick up the check from a Mr. Victor Delattre , mail it to me and I 'll mail a check back to you . " " Much obliged , Mort . " " You 'll be there , now ? Do n't let me down . " " You can depend on me . " " As the old song goes . " " Right . That dates both of us . " " Good luck , kid . " I drove back through the Haight , a hopeless reconnaissance  --  the odd plastic medicinal smell I 'd noticed at the Electron Zone wafting through my open window ( was it exuded through the pores of the meth freaks ? )  --  then on to Tenth and Harrison to file a claim at the state unemployment office.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
