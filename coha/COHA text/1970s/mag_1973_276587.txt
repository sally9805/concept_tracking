Peace negotiators have been meeting secretly for the past year at law offices in Manhattan and Minneapolis-St . Paul to settle a long and chafing conflict between two industrial powers . On one side was International Business Machines Corp . of Armonk , N.Y. , the world 's largest maker of computers ; on the other was Control Data Corp . of Minneapolis , which ranks fifth in the U.S. computer industry . Last week the companies announced an agreement : Control Data lawyers consented to drop the company 's four-year-old antitrust suit against IBM . <P> Both sides could claim a victory . <P> IBM , which controls at least two-thirds of the entire computer market and has a reputation as a tough and unrelenting competitor , had been accused in the suit of all sorts of monopolistic mischief . With the settlement , IBM executives disposed of the antitrust complaint without having to admit to the charges . <P> <P> IBM may also have weakened another serious challenge . The Justice Department has its own antitrust suit pending against IBM , and Government lawyers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinthine complexities of the computer business . As part of the settlement . Control Data agreed to end that assistance . <P> In return for dropping its suit , Control Data won a good deal . For about $16 million , it will acquire IBM 's Service Bureau Corp. , a subsidiary that processes customers ' data and sells time on its own computers . Wall Street analysts reckon that the Service Bureau 's real market value is closer to $60 million . In addition , IBM will buy services from the bureau for five years , stay out of the services business itself in the U.S. for six years and reimburse Control Data for $15 million in legal fees spent on the case . Total cost of the package to IBM : at least $80 million . William C. Norris , Control Data 's one-man-gang chairman , said that the daring suit had turned out to be " one of the best management decisions in our history . " <P> Norris has long held a grudge against IBM . Control Data , founded in 1957 by Norris and seven other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence by concentrating on a part of the market that IBM did not dominate : the large computer used mainly in scientific research . In 1963 , Norris ' engineers came up with the biggest " number cruncher " of all , the 6600 . But before Control Data could put it on the market , IBM announced that it would introduce a giant computer of its own , the System 360 Model 90 . Such is the magic of IBM 's name that a word from Armonk was more persuasive than a machine from <P> Minneapolis . Control Data was technologically far ahead in the contest , but IBM 's announcement dried up orders for Norris ' 6600 . In a rage , he filed the antitrust suit . <P> Norris ' reprisal will speed Control Data 's financial recovery . The firm lost a total of $46 million on computer operations in 1970 and 1971 , but will probably report a small profit on them for 1972 . Acquiring the Service Bureau , which last year earned $1.5 million on revenues of $63 million , will swell Control Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the services business . Control Data now has 27 service centers of its own and will pick up 44 more from the Service Bureau .
