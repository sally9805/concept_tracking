txt Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's expulsion from the Soviet Union is bad news to Nikita Struve . The literary director of the small company which publishes the dissident writer 's works in Russian here in Paris expects more new manuscripts can be published . But he says it with a sigh . What concerns him is the future of the dissident movement in the Soviet Union The combat will be continued , " he said soon after learning that Mr Solzhenitsyn had been deported . But it will be necessary to do more . " And it will be more difficult to make ourselves heard . We will have to speak more loudly . " He was ' untouchable ' " Solzhenitsyn was the untouchable , " he explained . " He was the one free man Now that he has been expelled , he no longer has the status . " Certainly the expulsion will make waves There will be reactions . But it is like the invasion of Czechoslovakia . The Soviets are counting on the ability of people in the West to forget . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought . " Yes , " he said , " I suppose that now there will be no more problem with the manuscripts . " For Mr Struve that is quite a change Once his publishing house , the Paris-based , Russian language YMCA Press , could get Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's work only from underground sources . " We would get a mysterious telephone call , " Mr. Struve remembers , " or receive the manuscript through a friend " Exclusive rights held Beginning with the publication of Mr , Solzhenitsyn 's historical novel " August 1914 " in 1970 , the YMCA Press has had exclusive Russian-language rights and has received its material from Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's lawyer in Zurich . According to Mr , Struve , a good deal of finished but unpublished work now could theoretically be released by Mr Solzhenitsyn , // *Exile ' setback to dissent ' // He says that at least some of Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's finished manuscripts have already found their way out of the Soviet Union ? carried by travelers , tourists and others , and through other secret means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains , " at least the ones which have gotten out . But some , he was still working on there . " Mr. Struve says he has an idea which ones have been brought out , but he does not know where they are being kept . Two parts published He believes that " The Gulag Archipelago , " Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's long study of Soviet secret police and labor camps from 1917 to 1956 , and the book whose publication here in Paris led to Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's expulsion , is a finished work . But only the first two of its seven parts have been published . Mr. Struve believes the remaining five are safely in the West . Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's historical novel , on the other hand , is not finished . " August 1914 " was only the first book . Mr. Struve says two more books , " October 1916 " and " February 1917 , " are nearly complete , but he does not know whether the manuscripts are in or out of the Soviet Union Mr. Solzhenitsyn plans still more books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One major question is whether Nata1ya , Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's wife , will bring anything out with her when she comes . Another is whether Solzhenitsyn manuscripts still in the Soviet Union can be smuggled out the way others were earlier . " It is Russia who is the loser , " Mr. Struve insists now . " Solzhenitsyn did not lose anything . He is a strong man , he will still be able to work well , he still has much work to do . " Some commentators here in Paris have taken a more pessimistic view . One quoted Danton , the French revolutionist , who is said to have explained when he refused to flee France and the guillotine , " You can not carry your homeland on the soles of your shoes .
