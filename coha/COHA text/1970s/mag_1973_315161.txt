Nothing escapes the surge of inflation-certainly not money . Who could have predicted that the lowly copper penny would one day be priced out of the market ? Alas , that day is at hand , and the Senate last week passed a bill , proposed by the Department of the Treasury , that would allow production of a new penny made of 96% aluminum alloy . The Treasury 's problem : the copper used in minting billions of pennies annually is growing prohibitively expensive . Last January , the world price of copper was 50 per Ib . Now the price is more than $1 per Ib. and , the Treasury Department notes , if that figure reaches $ 1.20 , the cost of making a cent will exceed the face value of the coin . Metal profiteers call that the " melting point , " and it would usher in a vast hoarding of pennies in order eventually to melt them down for sale on the open market . <P> The new lightweight , aluminum-colored coins will go into production if that melting point is reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side and the Lincoln Memorial on the other . The metal needed to produce them will cost the Government 90% less than it now spends on copper . Thus , not only will pennies cost less to produce , but the likelihood of their again reaching the melting point within the next several years will be sharply reduced . To critics who like the reassuring heft of copper , the Bureau of the Mint points out a shade defensively that aluminum is an acceptable coinage metal in 36 countries of the world . What the Mint fails to add is that many of these are among the world 's poorest nations .
