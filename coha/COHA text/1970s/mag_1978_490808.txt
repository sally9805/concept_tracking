Notes and Comment WE have received the following letter from a young woman we know : Not long ago , I had an abortion , under what must certainly be called the best of circumstances . It was performed in an excellent hospital , by my own gynecologist . The father was loving  --  I remember being grateful and relieved that he was as saddened as I by the necessity for the abortion but understood that it was n't happening to him . There was enough money . I have close friends . And so on . I went into the hospital early in the morning , and was home in bed early that evening . At seven the next morning , the telephone rang . A woman asked for me . " Yes ? " I said . " How are you ? " she asked . I said I was O.K. " Well , we know that yesterday morning you murdered a six-week-old baby girl , and we 'd like to offer you some guidance . " " Who is this ? " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty , and I want to help you . " I asked for her phone number and said I would call her right back . I dialled the number , and reached a recorded message from a movie theatre . Then I called my doctor , and he told me that anti-abortion groups pay nurses for lists of women who have had abortions , the same way diaper companies used to pay nurses for lists of women who had given birth . There are women all over the city  --  probably all over the country  --  who are getting phone calls like that one . Many of them are alone and scared and ashamed . I was none of these , and my doctor took time to call back to reassure me that there was no possible way to determine the sex of a six-week-old embryo . I try to figure out what would drive a person to make such a phone call . Hatred ? Deep principle short-circuited by desperation ? Fanaticism ? Frenzy ? I do n't know . But I do know how I felt then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind : as if I 'd suddenly lost my ability to think . Zeke SOME of the best things that happen go by so fast they seem not to have happened at all . One was the performance on Broadway for eight days in April of Morgan Freeman as Zeke the wino in Richard Wesley 's " The Mighty Gents . " Wesley 's play , which deals with the relationship between Zeke and four aging members of a black Newark street gang known as the Mighty Gents , appeared previously , as " The Last Street Play , " at the Manhattan Theatre Club , where it ran for two weeks in May , 1977 . It reappeared with its present title at the Kennedy Center in Washington in March , and then came to the Ambassador , opening on April 16th to favorable but quiet reviews . Freeman 's performance won a Drama Desk award , a Tony nomination , and the Clarence Derwent Award . It was an electrifying piece of work . Zeke starts out as a harmless bum but slowly becomes a satanic presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the play . Freeman wore a battered suit , a historic fedora , and a long , sinister overcoat , and everything he did was hyp notic . He moved in the queer , jerky , hurry-up-and-wait way of street hums , his hack curved like a boulder , his left arm constantly flailing , his legs bent and rubbery . His voice was guttural and his diction both ruined and precise ( not a word was lost ) , and he alternately cajoled and roared and mumbled . At one point , he took a classic pratfall , his head hitting the floor and his legs flying toward the ceiling . It was marvellously funny , in the old vaudeville way , and it was horrifying . In outline , Freeman was every stage and movie drunk of the last century , but in intensity , detail , rhythm , and sheer cumulative presence he was unique and indelible . Freeman lives in a big old West End Avenue apartment with his fiancee , Myrna Lee , who is doing graduate work in costume and scenery design at Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also has two daughters , who live in Chicago with their mother ) ; and a dog and a cat , named Nema and Zipper . He is tall , and is the diameter of a barber 's pole . His small face is dominated by his eyes , which laugh and gleam . He has a good baritone , but he often speaks so low his words blur . Seated on one of two sofas in his living room , which also has a fireplace and lots of books , he is a bony , akimbo jumble of arms and legs . " I wish they 'd stop giving me awards -- except , of course , when they come with checks , " Freeman said the other day . " I won my first acting prize in Greenwood , Mississippi , when I was thirteen . Every year , they had a kind of dramatic meet  --  a tournament in which local schools put on plays , which were judged like pies . The winners competed at the state level , and the first year I entered , our school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still have that little medal . We won again in 1952 and 1954 , and I was real well known in Greenwood . Then if I did n't top that by up and nearly dying . I was in everything in school  --  the glee club , dramatics , the debating team , the band . So I travelled all the time , but I did n't bother to eat , because I never had any money and was never much of an eater anyway . ' We went on a hiology field trip in the woods , and a friend and I were swimming across a pond we came to , but when I got halfway I could n't go any farther . I remember thinking , just go down to the bottom for a minute and rest . I went down and down , but there did n't seem to he any bottom , and the next thing I knew I was at the surface and three people were pulling me out . The day after , I could n't move , and they discovered I had malnutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the hospital two weeks , and my mother nursed me hack , and , as she always did in had times , only collapsed when it was over . I was n't born in Greenwood but in Memphis When I was two , I was sent  --  or abandoned  --  to Charleston , Mississippi , to live with Evelyn Freeman , who was my father 's mother . She had been married to Morgan Herbert Freeman , and my father was Morgan Porterfield Freeman , but they forgot to give me a middle name . When I was six , my grandmother died , and I was shunted off to Chicago with my sister Iris Virginia , who was a year and a half younger . My mother and father were living there with my mother 's cousins , who had three or four children of their own . We arrived in the dead of winter , and I could n't believe how unfriendly the weather was  --  the bitterness of it , the unyielding quality of the cold , as if it was after you . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Greenwood with Lenora  --  Lenora Greenlee Revere , who was my mother 's mother . My sister and my mother and I moved down there into my grandmother 's three-room shotgun . My father stayed in Chicago  --  which was just as well , because he and my mother just did n't get along , no matter how often they tried . I never did see that much of him  --  I thought of my stepfather as my father  --  and he finally drank himself to death in 1961 . My mother got a job as a teacher in Money , Mississippi , which was a nearby hamlet . It was exactly what you see in Eudora Welty 's book of photographs , ' One Time , One Place . ' The school was a small building , and there were several grades to a room . Then , when I was nine and in the third grade , we went hack to Chicago , where I had a real tough teacher who had a voice like Lauren Bacall . My mother and sister and I generally lived in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked nights as a nurse 's aide . All we did in Chicago was move . The windowsills were our freezer , and once we lived in a building that stood by itself on an empty lot . In 1948 , we settled in Gary , Indiana , and my mother became deathly ill . Her mother came to get her , and my sister and I went with them , and there we were again at 431 Pelican , in Greenwood . I 'd been in the seventh grade in Chicago and I was an excellent student . English : superior . ' . Math : superior . Deportment : superior . But they gave me a test in Greenwood that had a lot of Mississippi history and things I had n't studied in Chicago , and I flunked , and they put me hack a year . I was crushed . But then I started acting , and when I graduated from high school in Green-wood I was offered a partial scholarship in dramatics at Jackson State College . I was sick of school , however , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force , and ended up as a radar mechanic . I was a good radar me-chanic and a bad soldier . I was discharged in 1959 in San Bernar-dino , and I went straight to Los Angeles , where I bought a trenchcontand a porkpie hat and presented my-self at the Paramount Studios . That was in February , and between then and April I did n't eat much . Finally , I landed a job at Los Angeles City College as a transcript clerk , and I enrolled in courses in acting , voice develop-ment , and diction . A Year later , a friend and I spent five months in New York , and all that happened was I joined the Negro Actors Guild , for ten dollars . I went hack to the Coast , but to San Francisco , where I joined a company called the Opera Ring . I did the street singer in ' Threepenny Opera , ' and got my first mention in a review . I came across it the other day . It was in the Chronicle , and I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the celebrated crook with an appropriate blend of awe , respect , wry humor , and barely perceptible sad ness . ' I started dancing lessons . I washed cars . I sold ads for a black magazine . I worked at the post office . I hummed a lot and lived on quarter-pound Baby Ruths for dinner . In the early sixties , I moved to New York for good . I worked in the garment center . Then I landed a job as a dancer with Michael Kidd in an extravaganza out at the World 's Fair . In one routine , we dressed up in fur and played Eskimos . After the Fair , I could n't find nothin ' , and I ended up as a counterman at Nedick 's in Penn Station . One night , a dancer from the show came in and I was so embarrassed I nearly got under the counter . But I got through 1965 , and the next year I went on the road with ' Royal Hunt of the Sun , ' and I joined Equity and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tahori 's ' The Niggerlovers , ' with Viveca Lindfors and Stacy Keach , but it did n't run very long . That was when I met Douglas Turner Ward , of the Negro Ensemble Company . They were auditioning across the street , and he asked me if I wanted to try . I said , ' Man , you can come and see me any night in " The Niggerlovers . " ' Well , he did n't come and I did n't go over , and that was that . I ran into him again a couple of years later on Martha 's Vineyard , and it was ' How you been , man ? ' and all that . I had auditioned for Gower Champion for the original ' Hello , Dolly ! ' but I could n't make a triple pirouette , and when they put together the black one , with Cab Calloway and Pearl Bailey , I auditioned again and got the part of Rudolph the headwaiter . I stayed eleven months , then did some political cabaret at the Village Vanguard and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . I was a standby for Purlie at the time ' The Electric Company ' came along . ' The Electric Company ' paid me more than I 'd ever been paid before , and suddenly I was making something unbelievable like seventeen thousand dollars a year . ' The Electric Company ' was great the first two years . The vibes were good , we were a family , and watching Bill Cosby all the time was something else . But I 'm restless and I 'm afraid of the Captain Kangaroo syndrome . I quit once , but I ended up staying five years , and I 'd probably still be there if the show had n't gone off the air . " While I was doing ' The Electric Company , ' I did Richard Wesley 's ' Gettin ' It Together ' at the Public Theatre , and I could n't believe that this young guy in his twenties had written it . I wanted to know when he wrote something else , and when ' The Last Street Play ' came along a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Braxton the crook , and Zeke the wino . I was given my choice of Braxton or Zeke and took Zeke , and that was a challenge . It was something that was totally not me  --  an old man , a failure , a wino . I had always watched Gig Young play drunks in the movies , and I understood that when a drunk slurs his words it is not because of sloppiness but because he is trying so hard to enunciate properly . His intensity flattens his words . I watched a wino Richard Pryor does , and I watched the winos on Broadway near here . I recalled two long conversations I 'd had with winos , in Greenwich Village and out in San Francisco . " Freeman jumped to his feet and stood in the middle of the room . He went into a boxer 's crouch and squinted his eyes and brought them slowly down from the middle distance to regular eye level . He swayed and grabbed the mantel to steady himself , and started talking in a thick , unintelligible dialect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and he shuffled and pointed a long finger at the wall . In ten seconds , he was the bum in his memory , He laughed , and stood erect and opened his eyes and sat down again . " I remembered an old guy with a fluttery hand I 'd seen , and I worked that in . I worked on the look that comes into a man 's eyes when he asks for a dime and is refused . The right voice and speech came more slowly . I tried to get across the feeling of where the voice had been by the time it was burnt out . There 's some talk of reviving ' The Mighty Gents , ' but I do n't think I want to do Zeke again . I want to move on . I 'm totally interested in the movies , and have been since I was a kid . I went to the movies every day when I was growing up , and my mother told me over and over , ' One of these days , I 'm taking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's likely no one will ever do  --  the black tank battalion in the Second World War that was Patton 's spearhead , and the black regiment in the Civil War that fought so much better than the whites on their side they were bitterly resented , and Dodge City when it was full of blacks . I wanted to be a cowboy when I was little , and I still do , and someday somebody 's going to come along and say , Here 's your Western , Morgan . Do it 3 ) Up , Up , and Away p EN NSYLVANIA STATION in Newark is only fifteen minutes away from Pennsylvania Station in New York , but it belongs to another world , a world full of very visible trains . You see , it 's a real train station : there are trains whizzing in from all directions , in an astonishing variety of cdors  --  not just the red-white-and-blue of Amtrak but the silver , blue-andwhite , brown , green , red , and even dark-hIueand-yellow of the commuter trains that begin and end their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead run , and a nonstop series of announcements , some of them almost comprehensible , on the public-address system . We had fitful opportunities to observe all this when we alighted there at five-twenty on a fine recent Tuesday evening and started to run , too  --  in the wake of the railway buff E. M. Frimbo , as that elderly man catapulted himself down a staircase , raced through a vast waiting room with a forty-foot ceiling and giant chrome lanterns encircled by the signs of the zodiac , and bounced up another staircase , to Platform 5 . " Makes you think of Tokyo Central , does n't it ? " Mr. Frimbo said as we galloped alongside him to the far end of this platform . " But we 're only in New Jersey . We 're also in one of the finest architectural monuments to the concept of Art Deco  --  you must have noticed that as we went through the waiting room . If anything finally does happen to Radio City Music Hall , we can move the Rockettes and those Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the difference . Years from now , of course , when the New Jersey Department of Transportation , that great and benevolent institution , gets the money , we wo n't have to do all this sprinting , because the line we 're about to travel on will be electrified , and then our next train will run right out of New York . " " E. M. Frimbo ! " shouted six rather staidly attired businessmen at the end of the platform as we at last came to a stop beside them . " Glad you could join us . She 'll be pulling in in a minute . " We had always wondered what sort of people E. M. Frimbo hangs out with when he 's on the road , but we had n't been sure that we were ready for one of his six-week grand tours . And then , a couple of days earlier , he had suggested that we come along on a special overnight lark with a set of his travelling companions , and we 'd signed up at once . This evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher of a trade publication , Railway Age ; Tom Streeter , a railway special-ist in a large Wall Street brokerage house ; Arthur Yorke Allen , chairman of the firm that pub-iislKs the Official Rail-way Guide , a collection of passenger timetables which still comes out ten times a year ; Por-ter Collins , of the Na-porano Iron $E Metal Company , who sal-vages beat-up old lo-comotives and nurses them back to health ; and a couple of pure amateurs , who , like Frimbo himself , simply enjoy riding on trains . " I like to think of this particular group as the Friends of the NJ . Dot Museum , " Frimbo said , " which is what we call the New Jersey Department of Transportation , which has taken over the commuter trains of the now ignominiously bankrupt Penn Central , Erie-Lackawanna , Jersey Central , and Reading railways and pays for what would otherwise no longer exist . " " N.J. Dot sure is a museum , " Bob Lewis said cheerfully . " It has bought cars of all vintages , from age one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so many colors . That train on Track 3 has cars from the Santa Fe Railroad . The one arriving on Track 4 has cars from the Burlington , the Northern Pacific , and the Great Northern . And over there 's a train with cars mostly from the Rock Island . And that streamlined car with the observation dome at one end used to go to Florida on a train called the Silver Meteor . Right now , on any other day , I 'd he getting in that car , which belongs to my commuter club , and be off on my way home to Red Bank , on the north-Jersey coast . And this darkblue-and-yellow train coming in on our track is all Kansas City Southern , with one exception . " As though on command , the train halted so that the one exception was only inches away from our group . " This car , gentlemen , " Lewis said , " is the museum 's prize antique . " Streeter stepped forward and opened not a door but an elaborate brass gate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform of a car that looked exactly like the one in which Harry S Truman conducted his campaign for the Presidency in 1948 . " No ? " we said . " There ca n't be anything like this in existence today ! " " Well , you 're almost right , " said Lewis . " This is the last open-platform observation car left on any scheduled passenger train in this country . And it pulls out of here at five-thirty five nights a week  --  Monday through Friday  --  on the end of a train for Phillipsburg , sixty-six miles away . I hope you 've brought along a sandwich , because we wo n't be dining until after eight o'clock , and that will he in Easton , Pennsylvania , across the Delaware River from Phillipsburg . I organize holidays like this for Friends of the N.J. Dot now and again during the long summer evenings . " Having already been warned by Frimbo , we had fetched along a brace of roast-beef sandwiches from the Fountain deli , across the street from our office , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Put your bags on the rear seats in the car to hold places for yourselves , and then come on out again , " Streeter told us . The five-thirty for Phillipsburg was pulling out as we went back outdoors . We noticed that our solemnly accoutred companions were now armed with cameras and were waving farewells to the crowds on other platforms . " Vote for me , and I 'll clean up this town ! " someone right behind us shouted , and we were on our way . The conductor came out on the platform to collect our tickets . " Eight tickets for P-burg ! " he said . " What 's going on out there ? A convention , in that boondock ? " " We 're railroad men , " Porter Collins said firmly . " And we 're staying outside here the whole way . " " Welcome aboard my train , " the conductor said . " I 'm on home ground now , " said Frimho as the conductor went on his way . " In better times , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with cars like this . I was present at the birth of this car we 're in  --  when it made its first run , from Jersey City to Atlantic City , as part of one of my favorite trains , the Jersey Central 's Blue Comet . That must have been fifty years ago . There were six canvas chairs on this platform then , and inside there was green carpeting and two rows of wicker armchairs . As I remember it , every car in the train was named after a comet or an astronomer . Just ahead of this car was a restaurant car , from which , unfortunately , the porter in our car could not fetch us drinks , because the Devil had invented Prohibition . This cheerful conveyance was unwonted and unwanted competition to the Pennsylvania Railroad , which had had the Atlantic City business practically to itself , with a parlor-car express named the Nellie Bly  --  after the newspaper reporter who refused to take Jules Verne for granted and made it around the world in seventy-two days instead of eighty . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in full fig in those days  --  in fact , the parlor-bar car on that train was named after Jenny Lind . Prohibition was eventually put to death , and something called Progress eventually put the Blue Cornet to death , but once or twice a year thereafter , on a summery day like this , I would charter this car and some of the Blue Comet day coaches from the Jersey Central Railroad and take off with friends of mine to such cheerily named New Jersey country seats as Egg Harbor , Woodbine Junction , and Bivalve . The Second World War turned me to more serious endeavors , and when peace came I could no longer find this car . Then , one night , Bob Lewis said to me , ' Why do n't you ride down to the north-Jersey coast with me and my friends in our club car ? You can have dinner with us at home and then we 'll put you on the mid-evening train back to New York . ' That club car turned out to he this very vehicle , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to their reward  --  such luxuries as commuter club cars , which are subscription affairs and guarantee every member a seat , tended to fade out during the war  --  but it was still , to me , my old Blue Comet star . The club car lost a lot of Wall Street patronage in 1967 , when the ferryboats from downtown Manhattan to Jersey City , which was then its terminal station , stopped running , and soon after that 1178 stopped running , too Then , a couple of years ago , Bob Lewis phoned me with the gladsome news that 1 78 had had its third resurrection  --  this one thanks to Dot . " It was a commuter run unlike any other we 'd ever been on . Even in the suburbs of Newark , some of the stations had a neat , nineteenth-century air . A few of them were actually landscaped . And before long we broke into rolling , hill-climbing open country . Tom Streeter said , " This is old . American country . The battles of the Revolutionary War were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tailings of the iron mines that supplied some of our munitions for that war . " There were , we observed , no Levittowns . There were only villages , vast stretches of woodland , dairy farms , meadows full of blooming wild mustard and of cows , who never seem to learn , running away from the sound of our train . And there were small clusters of commuters getting off at every stop . For the last forty miles of the run , we had the observation car to ourselves . " Not many passengers , " we said to Frimbo . " That 's why I call N.J. Dot benevolent , " he said . " It looks after its clientele not just in the big towns  --  Jersey is the must thickly populated state in the Union  --  hut in the thinly peopled northern countryside as well . " We shared our roast-beef sandwiches with Frimbo , and all too soon Bob Lewis said , " Folks , I have an apology to make about this wonderful trip . " " What 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lewis said . The train ended its run a good half mile short of the old station in Phillipsburg , but Bob Lewis had laid on a couple of cabs to pick us up there and take us to a steak dinner at the Sheraton-Easton Inn in Easton . " The Jersey Central once had three cars like this , " Porter Collins said as we alighted . " One is now a restaurant called Union Gap , near the town of Clinton , on Route 78 , on the way home . Forty years ago , we might have gone there from here on a Lehigh Valley train  --  but not anymore .
