txt The House of Commons will be dissolved Friday , May 29 . Thereafter the British embark on a short , sharp , and possibly explosive election campaign . On Monday , June 8 , nominations for would-be candidates close . Ten days later , on June 18 , the voters ? now 39 million strong ? choose a new government . It is a different sort of election from any other called in Britain in modern times . Rarely can quite so much have been at stake . For the three main political parties . For their leaders personally . For the electorate . It is a different sort of election in many ways . There 's the dramatic swing in public opinion back toward a government that only a year ago seemed certain to be crushed . There 's the rough political interruption for the first time anyone can remember of the pleasant softness of a sporting English summer . There are votes for the first time in history for teen-agers . There 's the absence for the first election time for 20 years of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake What is at stake for Prime Minister Harold Wilson is his office . If he wins he will be the first British political leader to be elected three times running for more than a century . And he still is a relatively young man . What is at stake for his Labour Party is its final emergence as unquestionably the preponderant party , the natural major force , in British politics . What is at stake for the Conservatives is the chance to turn the country again away from centralized state socialism before it is altogether too late and while the nation has the advantage of a stable payments surplus . Leadership issue For Edward Heath , the Tory leader , there is the issue of his leadership . For Jeremy Thorpe , leader of the Liberal Party , there is at one extreme the possibility of holding the balance of power between two equal giants , and at the other the final obliteration of a party that has played so fine a part in British politics for so long . The Liberals command from 3 to 4 million votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present house , with 630 seats , Labour and Conservatives , each with only about three times as many votes , hold 346 and 262 seats respectively . // Associated Press Harold . . . confident of victory *Wilson goes to voters ; Labour has the edge // Of lesser apparent importance but possibly equal actual significance is going to be the position of the two Nationalist members , one Scottish and one Welsh , and of Miss Bernadette Devlin , Independent Socialist member for Mid-Ulster . Britain is a unit comprising three nations  --  England , Scotland , and Wales . To this is joined , as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , a province with a fourth nationality . The strong tide of nationalist fervor has ceased to flood now . But the demand for domestic independence remains about as strong as ever . Both Liberals and Tories offer means for Scots and Welsh to regain much of that domestic independence . Labour does not : for its particular brand of planning depends on the centralization of effective power in London . This could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all is whether full provincial autonomy can be maintained . But without doubt the major issues as between the pasties will be economic and social . Meanwhile , for the electorate the certain consequence of its decision will be the establishment of one of the two big parties as unquestionably the major force , the " natural governing party " of the country . This century the Tories have won nine elections , the Liberals three , Labour five . But since World War II the Tories have wone three , the Liberals none . and Labour four . Strange glow Some observers judge that a fifth win for Labour will establish it unequivocally as the major party in Britain for the next 20 or 30 years , perhaps for all time . This , however , could be counting unhatched chickens . For one of the many odd factors that give so strange a glow to this election 's dawning is the almost universal anxiety that the next government , whatever its party , will be battered by heavy , perhaps almost unmanageable , economic seas before another two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftereffects of America 's recession , stung by the winds of a howling price inflation , awash with wage settlements , stranded by lack of investment , holed by unemployment . Nobody can tell in such a situation just what direction British politics would take . However , short of that happening there is no doubt that a fifth win for Labour would have historic implications . This anxiety about the future contrasts in a quite remarkable way with the composure of the present . The summer has come ? which in Britain always seems some how to be in doubt until it happens . The pay freeze has broken . Payments are in surplus . Debts have been repaid . Taxes , at last , have not had to be increased . Basis for case It is on these things that Mr. Wilson will build his case . These and the very equivocation in his attitude to the European Common Market that before had seemed such a liability . Now nobody believes that Mr. Wilson will take Britain in unless he is certain the deal is beneficial . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and since Mr. Heath , the British negotiator in 1962 , has left his reservations on the matters far too late to be effective ? this could be a very telling point . The Labour manifesto will probably look forward to a time of consolidation for Labour 's gains , watched over again by the same " winning team . " Labour strengths stressed After a tremendous struggle , it is likely to claim , the ' record payments deficit left by the Tories in 1964 has been turned into a record surplus . Industry has been restructured . Social welfare has been greatly improved . Pensions are about to be revolutionized . Roy Jenkins has been the most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer of modern times . James Callaghan has been a tower of strength at the Home Office . Labour , it will be said , offers now not only the successful but also the compassionate society . Mr. Heath has already declared he will fight the election on Labour 's record too . But from his angle this record looks very different . Every Labour promise made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house mortgages at 3 percent to record economic growth ; interest rates stay at an historic high ; there has been virtually no growth at all . Britain , indeed , has the slowest. rate of economic growth in Europe and one of the slowest in the world . Unemployment is higher than it has been at any time since the great slump . Wildcat strikes have tripled . Investment in industry is chronically low . Taxes are a crippling burden . And now Labour threatens the future even of that part of the economy that has given it its payments surplus ? the private enterprise exporters of know-how , of finance , of insurance , of shipping , of tourism , of stocks and shares , and oil , and the traders in wheat and cocoa and other commodities . Protection questioned The present payments surplus , Mr. Heath avers , produced by devaluation of the British currency , will prove poor protection against the great storms now brewing in the distance . The true protection , he says , will be economic growth , enthusiastic investment , cuts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasonable law and order both in society in general and in industry in particular . The Liberals will offer more radical solutions : Profit sharing in industry : devolution of power from Westminster ; but most of all a brake upon extremism in both major parties .
