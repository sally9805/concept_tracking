" Time is Fleeting , but Art endures " A Joseph Christian Leyendecker cult is now in the making . Museums and art galleries are conducting a courting dance of peacocks , competing to show his work . Publishers are consulting their computers for oracular projections as to his probable pull in the book stores and art shops . Art critics hail him  --  the painter who dipped his brush in the bright hues of the spectrum , and then endowed his drawing line with the clarity and musculature of a sculptured form rather than the two dimensions of canvas . Leyendecker ? ? ? ( Double take ) . Who he ? He is the man whose innumerable magazine covers  --  including more than three hundred for the Post , but also touching such other early 20th-century publications as Collier 's , McClure 's , Century , and Vanity Fair  --  made him the most successful commercial artist of his day , and his name a household word . He is the man pictured with this article , whose haunted and tragic face belied the steely strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lifetime of monumental creativity . His was the golden touch indeed , from his first illustrations for the Post , in 1898 ; and his first cover on May 20 , 1899 . Said a Post editorial in 1938 : " One request which has been repeated perhaps more than all others has been for some information on J.C . Leyendecker . Our delay in giving you this information has been due solely to the artist 's reticence . Joseph Christian Leyendecker 's dislike of personal appearances has become a legend . When we tell you that he has n't visited the Post since 1912 , you 'll understand why we consider this autobiographical sketch a triumph . " Did you know it was Leyendecker who was responsible for that Arrow Collar profile which has haunted several generations of less-fortunate mankind ? And for that ubiquitous Hart Schaffner &; Marx silhouette , in which the blade-straight shoulders , the slender waist and the cleft chin lured all men toward the glory of being the nobbiest dresser of them all ? " At Collier 's offices in New York at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leyendecker painting was unpacked . Here was the richest , the most sumptuous series of covers that had been created up to that time , for a magazine anywhere , here or abroad . Here began a new chapter in the story of American publications . JCL also did ads for Kuppenheimer men 's clothes , automobiles such as the spiffy Overland selling for $950 in 1914 , and its regally elegant passengers ( the price was low , but the style was high  --  never a bad formula to sell a product ) . His angelic boys and girls in Kellogg 's Corn Flakes ads drove many a mother into ramming the product down her own moppets in the possibly vain hope that a similarly miraculous glow of heavenly beauty and health might thereby descend upon them . At the height of Leyendecker 's fame , such a giant as Norman Rockwell thought of him as more than a master : " 1 began working for The Saturday Evening Post in 1916 and Leyendecker was my God . 1 actually used to , unbeknownst to him , follow him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him . I did n't meet him until perhaps around 1914 , but he was a wonderful man personally , as well as a great artist . He was a superb draftsman , and a fine colorist , and had an amazingly creative mind . In any history of American illustration , he will certainly hold a most important place . " JCL brought to commercial art a new thoroughness , particularly in the matter of the advance preparation and approach to the final painting . There was literally no limit to the pains he took to have every passage and element studied out before he began the painting itself . And I mean every smallest hrushstroke . In time other artists learned of his methods and observed the strength that resulted from them ; they began to follow a somewhat circuitous route before touching brush to canvas ; the result was a decided lift for the whole of magazine illustration in America ; but not one of the imitators reached his level of skill . Even in Europe the work of JCL was studied avidly , particularly in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent in European publications . Keen advertising men were quick to realize that an artist who could put such masculine power into his work could create sales-compelling pictures to present their clients ' wares . They sensed that this artist belonged to their age , a virile , commercial , industrial age , kept alive and alert by competition . They filled JCL 's mail with orders for paintings . He is said to have remarked once that it took him twenty years to learn to paint the creases in a man 's trousers so they would sell clothing . But sell clothing his work did , through the many superb fashion studies he did for Kuppenheimer clothes , Cooper underwear , Interwoven stockings , Arrow collars and others . As early as 1915 he painted a series of fifteen heads of children in full color for Kellogg 's Corn Flakes , some of which place among the finest of his career . Certainly they raised the level of American advertising art to heights it had not previously attained . For the Boy Scouts of America he painted two fine posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some for the United States Navy . Chesterfield cigarettes drew from him some of his strongest work . The drawing power of his advertising pictures enabled him to command the highest prices ever paid , up to that time , for advertising art . His work infused into American advertising a power and a beauty that reached the hearts , and the pocketbooks , of our people . Many consider it by far the most sales-compelling advertising artwork ever created , Photo copyright 01973 David Rowland ; reproduction by permission of Pioneer Museum &; liaggin Galleries . More than once he won the annual prize for the best poster art of the year , and in this he was far out ahead of the nearest contender . A leading art critic , Louis Chapin , frequent contributor on art subjects to The Christian Science Monitor , evaluates Leyendecker in these words : " When Earl Rowland decided , in the late 1950 's , that a formidably successful and suddenly forgotten illustrator might deserve to be written about as though he were an artist , the avant-garde intelligentsia could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinths of abstract expressionism , hunting for a way out . The two worlds of the thunderously subjective and the pointedly explicit never seemed further apart . " But later encounters with pop art , minimal art , and the anti-art of accident and process have gradually deprived the avant-garde of anything very clear-cut to be " avant " about . Many of its scattered members and hangers-on are looking around them and behind them to see what they may have overlooked on the long and supposedly endless forward march . " This means that they  --  and millions more  --  may at last notice the particular accomplishment of Joseph Christian Leyendecker . " Such delayed recognition would of course be nothing new . Toulouse-Lautrec 's posters and Daumier 's newspaper lithographs took years to gain a standing as art comparable to the same men 's paintings . But today we are less discriminatory against art that happens to advertise or be journalistic . If it works well , we have decided , it works even better by the thousands . " While Leyendecker is neither Toulouse-Lautrec nor Daumier , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his favor . The mass dissemination and the commercial status of his art no longer lock him away from critical interest , but perhaps open doors to it  --  as with John Rogers , that similarly appealing 19th-century proliferator of genre statuettes for the parlor table . " It happens , too , that Leyendecker was a man for mixing his media in special ways . Sculpturejoined with painting both in his modeling of background props and in the waxed , carefully shaped , anatomically alive look of his final renderings . And theater was very much present , in his sense of staging and in his own procedure as he went from his ' dress rehearsal ' into his flawless and unhesitant ' performance . ' " So the critic and the student are invited as never before to take this total artist seriously , as an artist . The doors are open . And what , at last , do we see ? " In one way , a craftsman of high precision in the German tradition ( where from the Bachs to the Feiningers such skillfulness seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be producing for the millions but whose toughest job was satisfying himself . " In another way , a painter with a smooth , totally readable elegance that was kin to the between-the-wars structuring and streamlining of industrial materials known as " Art Deco " ( you can see some of it decorating the buildings of Rockefeller Center ) , but was strong with his own grasp of form . " Above all an observer , who was looking and in his genial way reporting on the same times and almost the same people as did the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald . Try over , for its razor-sharp , crystal-clear affinities , this characteristic description of Daisy in the rain from The Great Gatsby : A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek , and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car . " We wo n't forget those times , partly because we wo n't forget Fitzgerald . And I would say it 's time to recall the gifted , humane and careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Leyendecker . " One who visited the JCL studio after the artist had died remarked that while thumbing through a few of JCL 's large pile of sketchbooks , he felt as though some great force had dealt him a blow in the solar plexus , so poignant was the evidence of colossal toil of this quiet painter . The visitor felt he had gained a wholly new and breathtaking comprehension of how vast a labor is possible to the human spirit , ignited by the fires of high talent bordering upon genius . " Bully ! " exclaimed Theodore Roosevelt in Washington when he saw one of JCL 's Post covers . " Get that artist down here . He is painting the American people ; I must talk with him . " Thus Joseph Chris-tian Leyendecker re-flected the likeness of America for half a century . And ably chronicled the home-ly , stirring things about her way of life ; the wonderment in a youngster 's eyes , when , for the first time , he sees his grandmother basting a turkey or trimming a piecrust ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how mom at home greeted her returned soldier son ; the pain of tak-ing castor oil when young ; the ill-concealed snicker of a caddy on the golf links ; the throaty harangue of the ward politician ; the blessed relief of the postman as he soaks his feet after a day of Christmas season deliveries ; a boy trying on his first long pants ; the delight of a young father when for the first time he holds his newborn son in his arms ; the rugged action of a football scrim-mage ; the slide of a runner to a base ; and many // matter , the development of matchless technique , can best be known by laying out before one , tear sheets that comprised his covers for The Saturday Evening Post . They range over a period of more than fifty years . If an evaluative graph of these paintings were prepared , it would be the period from 1926 or thereabouts , to about 1938 that would show no deep valleys  --  the ones for that period were JCL at his best , and the designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the statement by a prominent art editor that JCL was the " father of the cover design . " And , let us repeat , each cover in those days was conceived in the spirit of a poster , brief , succinct and professional . The covers rise in the crescendo of their quality to that period , and slowly fall after it had passed . The decline was a short one  --  scarcely perceptible to the layman . After 1943 , when he was sixty-nine , the Post abruptly ceased using his work . He was shocked ! He knew his magazine covers were still far ahead of the field , and felt his work still met with popular favor . Also , he remembered the conscientious toil he had put into every cover , felt his work of past years entitled him to a security for the few years that could remain to one of his age ; but he never reasoned that there should be for him an emeritus status ; he asked no special indulgences . He still felt that the posters and covers he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at last he had been able to reach The apogee of male sex appeal was , of course , a lifeguard , custodian of the safety of lesser mortals . Leyendecker painted him as part sea-god , part man-brute , with just a trace of the little boy he so recently was.pure design , shorn of all nonessentials . It must have been difficult for him to realize that certain banalities and mannerisms had crept in with the passage of the years ; there was oversimplification and he was working in a pattern that seemed repetitive . An art editor told the writer it was felt that JCL 's work had become " wooden , " and artists know that is a difficult stigma to overcome . Charles Beach , his principal model , who many thought handsomer than John Barry-more , Fredric March , Brian Donlevy and other gods of United States male beauty , seeing a photograph used for the cover to the then sensational new Life magazine had said to him , " Joe , you 're through . They do n't want your work any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by competition to keep abreast of the times . There had been cyclonic disturbances in the publishing world , and magazines were passing through a period of bitter soul-searching . Many were the changes in editorial policies ; a phase was passing with the speed and power of an earthquake . Complacency exploded into frantic dependence upon change . The public 's literary taste was on a toboggan . Months passed swiftly into years , and the American people saw no more of the interlaced initials of Joseph Christian Leyendecker on the covers of the Post . The twilight of a brilliant career was approaching . He had fallen into the Continued on page II8 Mark Spitz , at twenty-three . These two young men , if anyone would care to see it that way , indicate that times have indeed changed , but certainly not for the worse . The proof , to bend the old saying slightly , is not in the pudding , but in the painting . LIEMENDECKEIE continued from page 62 decline of his powers . In 1944 he made his will . He had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this tragedy of time , this ultimate triumph of art . It happens that my father Earl Rowland was one of those who recognized Leyendecker in his heyday as more than just a commerical artist , but as a painter for all time . Many of Earl Rowland 's words and ideas have been bequeathed to me , and have found their way into this article . He recognized JCL as greater than his popular reputation suggested . Father was at one time a well-known California artist , art lecturer , teacher and museum director . In I937 he took over the directorship of the Haggin Gallery-Museum in Stockton , California . During the twenty-six years following , he turned it into a museum of major significance , more than tripling its galleries and adding many thousands of objects to its collections . The full name of the institution is the San Joaquin Pioneer Museum and Louis Terch Haggin Memorial Art Galleries . It is located in a small city which claims more races and cultures than any other of its size in the world . In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish synagogues , it includes a Sikh temple , a new Buddhist temple and a Greek Orthodox church . Besides Caucasians it has large numbers of black , brown , red and yellow races . At one point it had the largest Filipino population of any city other than Manila . It was in this community that Earl Rowland took over the reins of directing its museum and providing a window on the world for its people . The museum had been built by a unique combination of descendants of California pioneers and a local boy who made good  --  one Robert Tittle McKee who went east to New York , established himself as an interior designer and married Eila Haggin , granddaughter of James B. Haggin , a wealthy ' 49er mining magnate who had extensive holdings in California and New York City ( including a mansion on Fifth Avenue ) . The McKees endowed the Haggin Gallery-Museum with many objects of cultural value , the crowning one being a wing containing a collection of original French antique furnishings , together with many paintings including the work of Renoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bierstadt , inherited from Louis Terch Haggin , Mrs. McKee 's father . During his time as director , Earl Rowland designed that new wing and a later large addition , and wrote and produced local radio programs ? " Halls of Romance " ? about the museum . He gave many cultures an outlet . There was an annual Japanese Flower Arrangement Show , Filipino dancers displayed their grace and Black religionists sang spirituals . He attracted an exhibition of rare Chinese Jades which drew nearly half the town 's then population of 50,000 in a little over a week . He brought art and taught art . Many a Stockton school child 's artistic expression was fired by his encouragement in Saturday morning art classes . Annually he put on a children 's art contest and exhibition which filled a large gallery with their work from floor to ceiling . If a museum is to he a window on the world , it must present a wide spectrum . The famous Thorne Min iature Rooms were displayed . A Stained Glass Exhibition of his design brought much appreciation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought Buckminster Fuller to lecture , sponsored a concert of the Thomas Wilfred Lumia Color Organ ( which years later was installed in New York 's Museum of Modern Art ) , showed original El Grecos , attracted the gift of a Ghirlandaio painting from Kress Foundation in New York and ? showed the cut burlap compositions of Alberto Burri . It was with the intent of providing a world window ' way out west in Stockton that Earl Rowland started collecting works by the famous Saturday Evening Post cover artist , J. ( ' Leyendecker . Through the years his museum had almost no funds for collecting but nevertheless , he collected . People were convinced by his integrity . To him art was defined as " the search for truth . " He knew that J.C . Leyendecker was not regarded by sophisticated critics as a fine artist . But Leyendecker 's work told the truth to the American public , truths about their daily selves , and as painting it was composed of fearless , truthful brushstrokes painted directly from the objects rather than from photographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his art from 1897 to 1950 Leyendecker recorded history as well . And so it was most fitting for Earl Rowland to collect him , since the museum was devoted to art and history . " Years later , " Rowland felt , " even the critics would come around . " So he began soliciting the gifts of original Leyendeckers until he had found seventy , the largest single collection in the world . He felt that Leyendecker had done such a phenomenal job of painting the people for over a half century , that it would he a tragedy for him to slip into the past unnoticed . So now the editors of the Post have asked me to write the definitive article on Leyendecker , and thanks to my father , I am able to shed some light on his carefully guarded personal life . Here is what Leyendecker himself tells of his early days : " The Leyendeckers are of Dutch ancestry , though followed two memorable years at the Academie Julian with Jean Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant , two famous artists of the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrating and designing covers and advertising pages for the leading magazines . About this time the Curtis Publishing Company acquired The Saturday Evening Post and I was among the first to contribute , with a series of illustrations for a Famous Poems page . My first Post cover appeared May 20 , 1899 . There was not hing distinctive in the appearance of the first few numbers ; it was not until George Horace Lorimer became editor that color was introduced and the cover became a design complete in itself . " we came to America in 1882 from Montabaur , Germany . I was eight at the time and was already covering schoolbooks with rudely colored examples of my work . At home I kept myself busy with more pretentious paintings which , for want of canvas , were done on oilcloth of the common kitchen variety . Whatever their faults , these pictures lacked nothing in size . They were all dutifully presented to long-suffering friends and relatives . " When I was sixteen I felt I 'd reached the saturation point in the oilcloth field , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the profession of being an artist . I still remember boarding an open cable car one windy day ( we were living in Chicago ) with three large canvases wrapped in newspaper and fighting my way through the crowded streets to an engraving house , where I showed my samples . The boss inspected a stag at bay , a chariot race and a Biblical subject , with amusement , but he did tell me to report for work . " I now had a job  --  that is , 1 was an apprentice without pay  --  with a chance to learn the art business in the intervals between running errands . Most of the work at that time was still drawn on wood and engraved by hand , or done in pen and ink and etched on zinc . The new halftone process was not used in our shop until a year later . In the meantime I 'd become a salaried man , starting at two dollars a week . I could now attend Vanderpool 's class at the Art Institute three nights a week . My great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights and , with ten cents to squander as I pleased , I invariably succumbed , after much deliberation , to a tall stack of wheats with syrup . As I advanced in my job , frequent increases in salary permitted additional courses at the Institute during my vacations and enabled me , five years later , to leave for further study in Paris . Then Through those long hours of study in Paris , JCL had come to a clear comprehension of the human figure  --  every bone , muscle , sinew , surface area of it ; how it is put together and how it works ; above all , how light and shade reveal its planes and contours , how it can be used symbolically in design , how the masters had used it ; in short , how to paint the figure . We find no record of his having studied from cadavers , as did the old masters , but he comprehended the human body as clearly as if he had . Those were the days of glory , of wine and roses . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commissions for more work failed to appear , except a brief series of covers for Hearst 's American Weekly , a newspaper supplement , a few poster designs for the American Oil Company and a series of portraits of American generals and admirals for the Timken Bearing Company . His brother had died in 1924 . Joseph had never married and now with his sister Augusta at his side , pouring words of hope and cheer into his ears , and a portfolio of samples under his arm , he called upon a few New York editors seeking work , but to no avail . The world-famous JCL , going from office to office , looking for work ! There was work that he could have gotten , but in his discouragement and panic and with considerable feeling of hurt pride , he allowed himself to give . up , at a time when a bit of his old persistence would have solved his financial problem . His discouragement deepened . lie became even more silent as the years drifted by . Wistfulness came into his dimming eyes , intensify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . Here was a gentle , capable , enlightened soul , growing remote in his old age from the concerns of this life . Death had lost most of its terror ; he saw it as a dark incident from which he might awaken into continuing life , perhaps then to paint still finer things . In July of 1951 he dragged out a half-forgotten , half-completed portrait of a young girl and began work on it again . He pasted a piece of brown paper over the arms andhands to work out a change in the positioning of those parts , even now , at seventy-seven , humbly trying to improve his work ! But the old fire had gone , this final effort was heartless , dispirited . He went to bed to toss through another hot , midsummer night . In the morning , after complaining of some pain in his side , one of the world 's greatest draftsmen , whose renderings of the human figure have been compared with h those of Michelangelo , quietly sat down on the davenport in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . It was July 25 , 1951 . A brief funeral service was held in the studio where the great posters had been brought into being . Not a dozen persons were present . His body was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery and Norman Rockwell served as one of the pallbearers . The others were men who had served him as models . The grave went unmarked until the father of the present writer sparked a move to have a simple stone placed upon it in 1956 . Discouragement  --  is it not the most potent of poisons ? Our best present information is that the last piece of his work published was the Christmas cover design of the December 24 , 1950 issue of Hearst 's American Weekly . The cover that was to be on the Christmas issue of 1951 was in process when he died , and he had remarked that it would be the finest of all he had done . He had spent days at the Bronx Zoo making studies of camels for this cover , which was to have been an Adoration  --  the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except the Madonna and Child . Between some of the small sketches on a page of one of the sketchbooks he left on his studio table , JCL had written a statement to the effect that there must be a continuing life after death , because so much honest effort as takes place upon this earth could not possibly be pointless and futile . Newspapers flashed half a stickful of details about his life and work to the people he had so often pleased : a few art magazines , preoccupied with heady discussions on abstract and nonobjective painting , found space for a small biographical bit about him . A hurriedly gotten together retrospective ? exhibition and sale of his paintings was shown . There is no adult American but can find in JCL 's vast and multifarious work some reminder of events that took place in his own life as he was growing up and finding his niche in the affairs of his times . JCL 's work appealed to every kind of American in every walk of life ; this fact alone establishes it as of enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave America its vision of Santa Claus . A mong Leyendecker 's greatest successes were his Christmas paintings  --  very often of St. Nicholas . But instead of the thin aesthete European children had watched and waited for , Leyendecker borrowed the round belly from the well - fed , prosperous Dutch , the rosy cheeks and coachman 's nose from his New Rochelle neighbors , the endearing mannerisms from Clement Moore 's " The Night Before Christmas , " and put them together with a generous portion of his own heart . Leyendecker worked with live models , most of them from among his own friends and acquaintances , and there has long been a search in New Rochelle attics for a grandfather 's photograph that might resemble Leyendecker 's jolly red gent . After all , what Mayflower descendent could hold a candle to a grandchild of Santa Claus himself . JCL had unwavering patience , profound and perceptive comprehension , and deep humility . He was meticulously honest in word and deed . He guarded every moment of his time ; his one great indulgence was  --  more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his maturity , man 's natural desire for play into a personal and overwhelming demand for more hours at his easel . He developed , and in large part invented , a style marked for its virile robustness , and he found the field in which it could reach ma ximum usefulness to America 's millions . His style was the logical outcome of French academicism , shorn of pedantry and dilettantism and pushed to its utmost in an industrial nation , slanted to meet the minds of a progressive people , summarized to render it something a runner could read , an art for the many . In it , his recognition of academic precepts ? " keep it simple " ? " think in masses " ? " watch your values " ? is apparent , but in his best work academicism is largely submerged in his individual approach . There is a breathtaking finality to his rendering ; he painted no vapory moods nor emotions , and his work is not susceptible to interpretation in the language of the professional art critic of today . If his limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in the field of poster design and in utterly magnificent draftsmanship . The portrait of his brother , painted when JCL was in Paris , aged 22 , and some later portraits , particularly some of children done for the Kellogg 's Company , and several heads for B. Kuppenheimer and Company , reveal a clear predilection for portraiture , which , combined with his philosophical insight into human character , might have led to undreamed-of heights , even to the company of the very great . One thinks of Rembrandt , Van Dyck , Velasquez . But , perhaps unfortunately , he shunned the museum approach to art and chose what seemed to him a wider field , a more numerous audience , remarking to Orson Lowell that he 'd rather have his work seen in fine reproductions by the millions who read the magazines , than in the originals by the comparatively few to whom the galleries are available . He was as proud of the enormous circulation of The Saturday Evening Post as was George Horace Lorimer , long its editor . His name will grow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our report , directed to the people he loved well and painted with perceptive and penetrating competence . We present it in the hope that he will never be forgotten and that even Americans too young to have known Leyendecker may understand the place his work occupies in American art , and gain an enhanced respect for integrity as an ingredient of design . For the rest we turn to'this portfolio of paintings that America once loved , for in them she saw her own way of life reflected with great skill . rs
