ASSISTANT Attorney General Will Wilson boasts a distinguished 25-year career fighting crime and corruption . He first made his mark as a district attorney in Dallas , then rode his rackets-smashing reputation to two terms as Texas attorney general . There he burnished his image as a tough prosecutor and in 1960 was chosen the nation 's outstanding state attorney general by his peers . When President Nixon appointed Wilson to head the Justice Department 's Criminal Division , the choice of the Texas **26;16525;TOOLONG was considered a natural one . In 21 years at the Justice Department , Wilson has lived up to his reputation , launching unparalleled attacks on organized crime and political corruption .

Wilson issued a statement last week explaining his relationship with Sharp and denying any wrongdoing . But new information has come to light that could have more serious repercussions . TIME has learned that Wilson paid for the installation of eavesdropping devices used against federal and state bank examiners investigating irregularities in the Sharp-controlled Sharpstown State Bank . <P> The incident occurred in late 1967 when bank examiners were beginning to delve into Sharp 's twisted financial affairs .

Wilson was then called by Joe Novotny , president of the bank , and told to pay the fee through his law firm . A memorandum Wilson wrote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed the transaction : " I received a telephone call from Joe Novotny and he said they had a bill for some construction work that they did not want to run through the books and that he preferred not to tell me why but that it was all right . They wanted me to send them a statement and they would send me $2,500 as a fee and for me to pay the bill . I told him I would . " <P> Paid for Bugs . Wilson received a bill for $2,500 on the letterhead of Construction Consultants , Inc. ; the charge was described as a " consulting fee .

" In an interview with TIME Correspondent Dean Fischer , Wilson said that he had no idea that the fee was for the bugging devices .
