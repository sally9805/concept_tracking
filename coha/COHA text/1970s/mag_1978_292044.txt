Computer World <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Bravo for " The Computer Society " Feb. 20 . The rapid advance of technology might be a more frightening phenomenon if man 's ability to change and adapt were not what put us in this position in the first place ! <P> <P> Harden H. Wiedemann Geneva <P> I fail to see how a computer society will enrich the lives of its people . Increased leisure time is already a problem in the U.S. Who would actively , physically participate in a sport or hobby when a computer could do it all for you ? Might not life become unbearably boring ? <P> <P> Yvonne Brandon Davis Carbondale , Ill . <P> <P> When we humans finally abandon the egotistical notion that skin and bones define sentient existence and that evolution is exclusively biological , we will recognize computers for what they are-the highest form of life on earth . <P> <P> John Swinton University Park , Pa . <P> <P> Robert Jastrow 's Essay , " Toward an Intelligence Beyond Man 's , " is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of computers ... will begin to match that of the human brain . " At no research laboratory that I know is there evidence for such a projection . Twenty years ago , computer conversion of spoken words to typed text was " around the corner . " Today we are still unable to duplicate this simple human function , let alone reasoning . We can not say that such things will never happen . We can say , however , that we have no scientific basis for forecasting the merger of human and machine intelligences at any time , let alone in ten or 1,000 years . <P> Equating the giant strides of computers to the simulation of human intelligence is at best scientifically naive and at worst sensationalistic fuel to the public 's suspicions about computers . <P> Michael L. Dertouzos , Director <P> Laboratory for Computer Science <P> Massachusetts Institute of Technology <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> More chilling than the vision of a pushbutton life was your litany of the " benign " influence of new-generation computers . Mindless worship of faster-and-easier is the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Jeff Iseminger Decorah , Iowa <P> Wrapped in sweaters and quilts against the cold because of a coal strike , I am reading about the computer society under one light bulb . Does n't it seem ludicrous that scientists are developing machines to take over more of our lives while we in Ohio are regretting how much we are already dependent on electricity and machines for our wellbeing ? <P> Cheryl Hildebrand Ashland , Ohio <P> Your vision of the Utopian future created by computers is enraging . Amid all the fancy gadgets , you still have the husband carrying out the important business while the wife does the shopping in an otherwise empty day . Some households of the present are doing better than that . <P> Marsha Zuckerman Pittsburgh <P> I found a **33;7798;TOOLONG baby in a 101-and 1010-cent store is the translation into binary of I Found a Million Dollar Baby in a Five and Ten Cent Store . <P> Edmund West Tacoma <P> Planet earth is signaling its presence to outer space with I Love Lucy and Tonight ? You 've got ta be kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better be ready to duck .
