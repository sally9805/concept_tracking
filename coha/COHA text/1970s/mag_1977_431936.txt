 | Most parents want to be the ones to tell their children the facts of life , but embarrassment and personal hangups often get in the way . Children , yearning for information , then take their questions outside the home where the answers are seldom right . Now , . a noted educator has come up with some down-to-earth guidelines to make the telling easier for parents , the learning safer for youngsters . And on page 76 , there is a special quiz to let you determine just how " askable " a parent you really are . Most parents want to educate their children about sex . Most parents want sex education to begin at home . Most parents want to be " askable parents , " the kind children turn to with their questions . Most parents realize that schools , churches , community organizations and the mass media can offer only supplementary sex education at best . And these agencies can not be expected to mirror personal and family values . Unfortunately , however , many parents fall down on the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex with their children . ( These are usually parents who did not receive sex education in their own homes . ) Many parents fear that too much information about sex too soon will have the negative consequence of overstimulating their children . Some parents worry that they do n't know enough about the subject to enable them to be effective teachers . Others are concerned about the possibility of traumatizing their children by making honest mistakes or by giving them some wrong answers . Still others worry about the neighbors . What if their child tells the truth about sex to some little friends whose parents hear about it and express , in no uncertain terms , their horror and indignation ? Survey after survey reveals that fewer than 20 percent of young people feel that their parents gave them a satisfactory sex education . Some parents , who report that they did educate their children about sex , might be surprised to learn that their sons and daughters scarcely agree . " My parents ? " one youngster observes with a laugh . " You must be kidding ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another teenager explains , " only to discover in college that most of what I learned was not true . " If sex education really belongs in the home ? and most of us agree that it does ? let 's figure out what we can do to get it back there . First there are two myths to overcome . Myth one holds that today 's young people already  | know everything there is to know about sex . Some do , of course , but research indicates shocking ignorance . In an important 1976 Johns Hopkins study of adolescent girls , only 41 percent knew when in the menstrual cycle the risk of conception was greatest . In a study of 300 pregnant teenagers ( in a single high school ) , the girls were asked why they had n't practiced birth control . " Oh , but we did , " was the general response . Their specific answers , however , revealed that quite the opposite was true . " I used one of my mother 's Pills . " " I did n't think I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd pull out in time . " " I did n't think I could get pregnant the first time . " " I used foam . " ( Careful questioning subsequently confirmed that many used contraceptive foam , but as a douche after intercourse . ) The one million adolescent pregnancies in 1976 , the three million new cases of venereal disease in the same year ( two-thirds among young people under 25 ) , and the plainly destructive consequences of misinformation about masturbation , homosexuality , and the nature of normal and abnormal sexual behavior emphatically contradict the myth that young people know everything there is to know about sex . Myth two holds that knowledge is harmful . Virtually all opposition to sex education is based on the assumption that children who know about sex will do it . In fact , newspaper editors often blame sex education for the rise of illegitimacy and venereal disease . Critics of the Scandinavian countries have held sex education in the schools partly responsible for high rates of sex crime , suicide and outof-wedlock pregnancies . But the truth is that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denmark , Sweden and Norway , teenage birth rates and seriious sex crimes have dropped . Ignorance , not knowledge , leads to irresponsible behavior . I 've never been able to discover a documented case of a child 's having been overstimulated by facts alone . Indeed , when was the last time you tried to tell your child too much about anything ? Should parents err in the direction of too much information , children simply get bored , turn them off or cut them short . This is not to say that overstimulation is not a problem . It is , but it derives not from knowledge , but from fears , unresolved curiosity and ignorance . Now let 's get to the specifics of how parents can overcome their hang-ups about sex education . First there are the parents who feel uncomfortable . I do n't have any instant remedy for such feelings , but it may be helpful to point out that no one is really comfortable about anything these days . Contrary to much modern theory , it simply is not necessary to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sexuality in order to be an effective sex educator for your children . If you convey to a young child , or even a teenager , the impression that you feel a bit awkward discussing love and sex , the chances are good that you 'll score . Your child might well respond to your honesty with genuine affection and appreciation , with a hug and a kiss and with verbal assurances that your discomfort is perfectly understood . Parents who fear they do n't know enough about the subject ought to pause and consider a question . How much is it really necessary to know ? To a particularly technical or baffling question , a parent can always respond with : " I do n't know , but I 'll look it up for you . " Or , better still : " Let 's look it up together . " If you think about it , what do you really have to know that you do n't know already in order to answer a small child 's question ? Older children are more likely to ask questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books no more distant than your local library , what excuse do you really have ? If your concern is that you might damage your child by giving wrong explanations , remember that the resilience of children is legendary . Parents should realize that they can make mistakes without harming their children . For example a child wanders into the bedroom while his parents are having sexual intercourse . What to do ? Tell the child to leave . In the morning you can apologize for not having said please . And then you  | can explain what you were doing . If your child asks to watch the next time , tell him he can not . Kindly and firmly explain that sex is private . A child may not understand the prohibition , but later in life he will grow to appreciate the concept of privacy , not only for his parents but for himself as well . Most important , learn to laugh at the outrageous proposition that a child who has witnessed the " primal scene " will need five years of analysis to get over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as a child , never saw his parents being naturally and openly affectionate . If you 're held back by your concern over the neighbors ' reactions , let 's take this one from the opposite point of view . What about parents who tell children that babies grow in cabbage patches and their children pass that information along to your children ? Do you suppose these parents care about your feelings when your children come home with such news ? Your responsibility is to tell your own children the truth , and without instructions to keep it confidential . If your neighbors do n't like it , that 's their problem . It 's about time that the well-educated children ? your children ? become an important neighborhood resource with respect to sex education . No matter what parents do , children will share whatever information they might have about sex . Is n't it better to share truth and fact ? No parents can have exclusive control over the sex education of their chil- dren unless they are prepared to rear them in virtual isolation ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Once you 've decided to tackle your child 's sex education in a calm and direct way , the question is when to start . I 'd say that the time to tell is whenever the child asks . That can be as early as two . With young children , the questions are sometimes nonverbal . For example , a child may constantly follow you into the bathroom . If your child has n't raised sexual questions by the age of five , then you should start the conversation . Read a book with him . Tell him about a neighbor or a relative who is going to have a baby . While it 's fine , on occasion , to refer to animals , do not concentrate on them in your explanations . People and animals have very different habits . Of the thousands of questions about sex education that I get from parents at the Institute for Family Research and Education which I direct at Syracuse University , the following are the most common . Some of the responses reflect my personal values . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must decide where you stand on specific issues . 1 make a special point of this because the subject of sex education often attracts extremists who try , often in the guise of " morality , " to impose their personal views on everyone else . Askable parents generally respond positively to the suggested answers in the questions which follow . Parents who are not askable may find themselves feeling somewhat provoked and perhaps indignant . 1 . How much should I tell ? I believe you should tell your child a bit more than you feel he can understand . 2 . How explicit should I be ? Always make it a point to use the correct terminology . Avoid such infantile euphemisms as " pee pee " or " wee wee . " Say directly that when a man and a woman love each other and want to have a baby , the man 's penis is placed into the woman 's vagina . If the sperm from the man 's body joins with the egg inside the woman 's body at the right time , a baby gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicit without overstating the case or feeling compelled to describe sexual techniques to a child who has n't yet grasped more basic ideas . It is also wiser to say at the start that a baby has its beginnings in the mother 's uterus , not the stomach . 3 . What about nudity in the home ? Many parents are relaxed about undressing in front of young children or bathing with them . These are good opportunities for children to ask important questions . " How come you have one and I do n't ? " " How come yours is bigger than mine ? " " How come you have two and I do n't have any ? " Parents should respond directly to these and similar questions . A question also arises when a child wants to touch a parent 's genitals or breasts . There are several perfectly acceptable responses . 0ne is simply that you do n't want him to .  | Even if a child protests using that familiar double standard ? " But you touch me " ? you can explain that is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not object to their children 's requests to touch , it is important to remain casual . Generally speaking , a child 's own growing sense of modesty ? his wish to go to the bathroom alone or to undress without an audience ? will tell you when to start undressing in private . 4 . Is too much masturbation harm-ful ? Masturbation is a normal expression of sexuality at any age . The only thing wrong with it is the guilt that people are made to feel , and it is this guilt that creates the energy for impulsive and involuntary masturbation . 5 . What about the use of obsceni ties ? Children invariably use vulgar language to get a rise out of their parents and to test a powerful new weapon . If a child uses an obscenities the parent should quickly and calmly explain its meaning , perhaps using the word itself in the explanation . Even the most common four-letter word can be handled in this way , provided the parent explains its gross intent as well as the fact that its a crude synonym for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The best approach , no matter how embarrassed you are , is to tell the child he has asked a good question and , if you still have your wits about you , answer it then and there . If you feel you ca n't answer right away , it is very important to praise the child for asking and to tell her specifically when you will discuss it . Generally speaking , it is better to risk shocking a few grown-ups than to embarrass your own child . 7 . What should I do if my husband thinks it 's my job to tell ? Sex education is properly the responsibility of both parents . If your husband stubbornly refuses to have any part of it , you must take it upon yourself to explain love and sex to all the children in your family . Incidentally , it has never been established that girls are best educated by their mothers or boys by their fathers . Single parents , relax ! 8 , What if my children think I 'm old-fashioned ? They will be right ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acknowledge it and continue expressing your views . 9 . How can I talk to my teenage daughter about birth control without giving her the message that it 's all right for her to have sex ? Some parents erroneously believe that teenagers equate information with consent . Your teenage children know very well what your values are . It 's one thing to tell a daughter that you will disown her if she becomes pregnant . It 's quite another to explain your feelings something like this : " We really think you 're much too young to have sex , but if you 're not going to listen to us we urge you to practice birth control . In any case , you should know something about birth control and , more important , we do n't ever want you to feel that there 's anything you ca n't talk to us about . " 10 . I worry about my children being molested . How can I talk about this without frightening them ? A little-known fact is that as many as 70 percent of all child-molestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step-parent or babySitter . As part of a family 's general liscussions about sexuality , children should be taught never to go off ? ith strangers and never to allow anyone to touch their genitals . Should you suspect that your child has been abused , it is essential to make him or her understand that promises he or she has been forced to make not to tell should never be kept . Never let a child who has been molested feel any guilt or blame whatsoever . ( Some parents unthinkingly ask , " Why did you let him do this ? " ) Such crimes are always and entirely the responsibility of the adult . 11 . We 've never talked about sex . Now I want to , but my teenage son absolutely refuses . What should I do ? It is appropriate for a parent to begin the conversation something like this , " I really made a mistake by waiting this long and wish we had talked when you were younger . " Plan ahead for such discussions ; have a book ready . Tell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Explain that some of the material might embarrass him , but that you 're going to leave the book around just the same . The main thing is for him to understand that you are available to talk anytime  | he is ready . Another technique is to " hide " a book like the one I 've written entitled , YOU ( a consciousnessraising guide for teenagers ) . Most teenagers are very adept at finding such " hidden " material . 12 . What is your opinion on premarital sex ? I 'm opposed to teenagers having sexual intercourse . They are too young , too inexperienced , too impulsive and do not have ready access to contraception . The double standard is still , alas , very much with us . Boys still use such lines as , " If you really love me , you 'll have sex with me . " Girls rarely reply with , " If you really love me , you would n't put this pressure on me . " In addition , teenage pregnancy is definitely unsound from the medical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am opposed to sex for teenagers , I also must say that in my 25 years as a clinical psychologist , no teenager has ever asked my consent . It is unrealistic for parents to assume their teenagers will not have sexual relationships in the absence of parental permission . Thus , parents must face the possibility that , however clear they have made their own values , their teenagers may just as clearly reject them . Should this occur , parents can still exert a positive influence . Without anger , they can say , " We do not want you to have sex . But if your mind is already made up , at least be sure to use birth control . " Young adults who are working or in college should receive similar parental messages . If they do choose to have sexual relations , it is their duty to act responsibly . 13 . What should be the role of the public schools in sex education ? Sex education should be part of the regular curriculum . It is currently excluded in many places because of censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having lustful thoughts . Are these harmful ? One of the key concepts in the whole area of sexuality is that all thoughts , desires and dreams are normal . Anyone with the slightest imagination or creativity has occasional thoughts of lust , sadomasochism , incest and rape . Behavior can be abnormal , but never thoughts by themselves . Guilt is the energy for the repetition of unacceptable thoughts . If a boy has homosexual fantasies and feels guilty about them , he 'll have these thoughts over and over until they become part of the selffulfilling prophecy . If , however , he recognizes that all thoughts are normal , nothing will happen and most of his thoughts will be voluntary ; the remainder involuntary but of negligible duration . A Final Comment : Sex education is a family affair . It is related to how you feel about yourself and your ability to communicate with your husband or wife . Askable parents talk to each other . They also have a sense of humor . Not everything is a trauma . Children with askable parents tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense . If you feel you 've made mistakes , you can smile and say , " My child will understand when 1 explain that I do n't know everything . " And then you 'll feel more askable than ever .
