St. Joseph 's Oratory in Montreal looks like Cecil B. DeMille 's idea of a cathedral . Enthroned on Mount Royal , the city 's highest hill , the oratory is bigger than Notre Dame , its dome only slightly smaller than St. Peter 's . It took six master architects 52 years-from 1915 to 1967-to erect , and among its accouterments are the carillon built for the Eiffel Tower , one of the world 's largest organs , two wax museums , three banks of escalators , acres of free parking and a restaurant supervised by a full-time French chef . <P> Star of the oratory , and the subject of much of its religious chrome plating , is the man for whom it was built -a semiliterate French-Canadian orphan named Alfred Bessette , better known as " Brother Andr , the miracle man of Mount Royal . " As a religious brother , Bessette served for 40 years as doorkeeper and handyman of Notre Dame College , a boys ' school at the foot of the hill . He was humble , devout and frail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is claimed , miraculous healing powers . <P> By invoking the favors of St. Joseph , his patron saint , and handing out bottles of burned sacramental olive oil , Brother Andr reportedly cured as many as 15,000 crippled , blind and dying pilgrims a year . When he died in 1937 , at the age of 91 , half a million people filed past his bier , and Brother Andr was put up for sainthood . <P> His case is still pending in the Vatican . At the oratory , in the meantime , he is being accorded the full trappings of a saint . The oratory publishes a comic book about his life , sells bottles of his " St. Joseph 's oil , " and maintains a tiny wooden chapel that he built as a holy place . Inside the cathedral , 3,000,000 pilgrims a year file past his marble tomb . Also in the gallery , until recently , was Brother Andre 's heart , preserved in an urn filled with a formalin solution . Then on the night of March 15 , in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . <P> The theft appeared professional . To get at the heart , the thieves picked three locks to open a steel door and an iron grille , then chiseled the urn off its marble pedestal-all without attracting the security guards . It was a sort of grisly Rififi ; yet no motive has been discerned . A local newspaper received demands for $50,000 in ransom , but they apparently came from cranks . By last week , although Montreal police still had two detectives on the case , the oratory 's priests had given up hope . Whatever the motive , the thief may have been doing Brother Andr a favor . Enshrined in the templed glories of package-tour religion , the humble lay brother 's heart was painfully out of place .
