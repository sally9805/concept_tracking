txt Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr . said today that he would not make the Federal Bureau of Investigation a target of his inquiry into Government surveillance unless he saw some evidence of illegality first : He said he had not found such evidence in nearly three years of search . Senator Ervin is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights , which brought the Army 's domestic intelligence operation to public attention last month . He said he would order a staff review of reports that the F.B.I . monitored Earth Day activities around the country last year and had used an electronically equipped informant to question Representative John Dowdy in his office . But in both of these instances , he said , he has not yet seen evidence that the F.B.I . exceeded its authority . " I abhor their conduct in the Dowdy case , " said Senator Ervin of North Carolina , a Democrat and former judge , who is a conservative on many issues , including race , but an outspoken defender a the individual liberties in the Constitution 's Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to send in an informant with an electronic device on him , " he continued , " but that 's just my personal feeling . It 's reprehensible , but I 'm not sure it 's illegal . " With respect to the surveillance of Earth Day , brought to light last week by Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine , Senator Ervin appeared to accept the Nixon Administration 's explanation that there had been potentially dangerous individuals among the wide spectrum of speakers . " Surveillance of people of the character of Rennie Davis , " he said , referring to one of the antiwar leaders convicted of Icrossing state lines with intent to incite riot during the Democratic Convention at Chicago in 1968 , " is probably the duty , of the F.B.I . " Boggs Evidence Awaited Responding to a charge by Representative Hale Boggs , the Democratic leader in the House , that the F.B.I . had tapped Congressional telephones , Mr. Ervin said , " I 'd be glad to hear from Representative Boggs on that . " But he insisted that he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations and charges regarding the F.B.I . has prompted the first high-level discussion of a general Congressional review in the bureau 's history . Senators John V. Tunney of California and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , both Democrats and members of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights , have proposed an inquiry into F.B.I . procedures . And , after the in Vestigation of Representative Dowdy was confirmed , Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana , the Democratic leader , urged that Senator Ervin and his subcommittee " look into it . " But Senator Ervin insisted today that , while he would not be intimidated by the bureau , he would not be rushed into an investigation . And Senator Mansfield said he had never meant to ask for an inquiry at all . Political Obstacles Cited Senator Ervin observed that there would be political obstacles to an investigation of the F.B.I . The subcommittee , he said , would be " very much divided , on ideological lines , " about such a project . He added : " I would n't ask the subcommittee to go any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its authority . And after two and a half years , I have n't heard any of that evidence . " Although he was particularly disturbed by the case of Mr. Dowdy , a Texas Democrat , who has been indicted by a Federal grand jury on charges of perjury and accepting a $25,000 bribe , Senator Erwin held Congress responsible for authorizing eavesdropping . The fact that the subject of this investigation was a Congressman is immaterial , he said . " Personally , I do n't think there 's any difference between tapping the phone of a Congressman and any other citizen , " he said . " Congressmen are not entitled to any exemption from laws that apply to other citizens . " Senator Mansfield , who first dismissed the complaints against the F.B.I . as " a tempest in a teapot , " but then seemed to change his mind yesterday , said today that he had meant to put the burden on the F.Brs critics to take their evidence before the appropriate committee of Congress , in this case Senator Ervin 's subcommittee . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . Kind Words for Hoover " This is a cause for grave concern , " Senator Mansfield said yesterday of the Dowdy matter . " I think the appropriate committees of Congress ought to look into it . Senator Ervin has been doing a good job . His stthcommittee is the one that ought to do this . " Senator Ervin , who will be 75 years old in September , had only kind words for J. Edgar Hoover , the F.B.I . ' s 76-year-old director , whom Senator Muskie and other Democratic contenders for the Presidential nomination have said they would retire . " I 'm under the impression that Mr. Hoover 's done a very good job , " Senator Ervin said . " Just because of age and length of service  --  and I 've had a good deal of both ? I do n't believe you ought to be putting a man out of office just because he 's lived a long time . But maybe I 'm not objective about that . " Muskie Criticized Meanwhile , Senator Robert J. Dole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged Senator Muskie with a purposeful effort " to hurt the F.B.I . and the job it has done . " In a speech released today for delivery tomorrow at a meeting of Republican Governors at Williamsburg , Va. , Senator Dole said Mr. Muskie , himself a participant in Earth Day activities here , had spoken of 40 to 60 F.B.I . checks on Earth Day when , according to Senator Dole 's investigation , there had been only four . " Now why was the F.B.I watching even four of these events ? " he asked . " It was not to maintain surveillance of the event or of the Senator , but because certain radical revolutionary individuals were expected to attend . " Representative Roger H. Zion an Indiana Republican , wrote in his weekly newspaper column today that Communists and their front organizations had initiated the recent criticism of the F.B.I . " A major . Communist-front originated attack is taking place on America 's top law ' officials , " he wrote . " Director J , Edgar Hoover of the F.B.I . is ' now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wife of the Attorney General Mrs. Martha Mitchell is the subject of ridicule in an effort to discredit the capability and effeectiveness of her husband . The pattern is beginning to emerge clearly for those who care to observe . "
