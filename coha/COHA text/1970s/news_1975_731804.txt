txt Gulf Oil Corporation illegally contributed $125,000 to the Nixon reelection campaign of 1972 . As penalty , the nation 's 12th richest corporation , with annual revenues exceeding $18.2 billion , was fined $5,000 ? or about as much money as Gulf collected last year every 10 seconds . Leniency ? No , judicial toughness . The $5,000 fine is the maximum which the law allows . Under Its provisions , virtually unchanged since Theodore Roosevelt 's presidency In 1907 , at least 18 corporations have pleaded guilty to unlawful campaign contributions totaling $1.3 million . Their combined fines : $49,000 , or less than 4 percent of the contributions . Rep. George E. Danielson ( DI of California , a member of the House of Representatives ' .1 tall clary Committee , thinks it 's time to upgrade the penalties and deterrence . " Corporations which make unlawful campaign contributions actually stand to gain by being caught , " he says . The money which they gave away is refunded , he explains , minus the fine . All but one of the 18 corporate contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no justification for a penal sanction which leaves the wrongdoer in a better position than where the law found him , " argues the Los Angeles lawyer . Representative Danielson has introduced legislation hiking the fine on illegal campaign gifts to the level of the contribution itself , plus any other penalties . It would apply to corporations , labor organizations , and government contractors . The bill ? a product of Mr. Danielson 's post-Watergate " mulling over how It all happened , " in an aide 's // * Firms may get stiffer fines // words ? Is expected to rally wide support in the new reform-minded Congress . First hurdle could be Rep. Wayne L. Hays ( D ) of Ohio , chairman of the House Administration Committee which will process the bill . Representative Hays has been an opponent of much campaign  --  reform legislation . " This may be an idea whose time has come ? after 68 years , " says an aide . Ironically , the original 1907 law was inspired by campaign activities remarkably similar to the recent ones : contributions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential campaigns of William McKinley in 1900 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.
