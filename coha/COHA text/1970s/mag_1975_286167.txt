AUGUSTUS JOHN <P> by MICHAEL HOLROYD <P> 676 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . <P> $17.95 . <P> <P> " Augustus Caesar , " so the poet said . <P> " Shall be regarded as a present god <P> By Britain , made to kiss the Roman 's rod . " <P> Augustus Caesar long ago is dead , <P> But still the good work 's being carried on : <P> We lick the brushes of Augustus John . <P> With this unusual mordancy , Punch in 1929 summed up the reputation of the most famous artist in England . John was then 51 , and he had been a public figure since the turn of the century ; he would continue to be one , through progressive embalmings as a Grand Old Man , for another 30 years . Nearly 6 ft. tall , bearded like the pard , and booming like a bittern , much given to fancy dress-cloaks , Carlyle-size black hats , gold earrings-he boozed and philandered his way through every level of English society . He was a licensed vertical invader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stretched from the Cafe Royal to Bloomsbury . There had of course been English bohemians before , but none had seemed so obstreperously life-enhancing as Augustus John . As Michael Holroyd observes in this superb biography , " In the public imagination he was to represent the Great Artist , the Great Lover , the Great Bohemian Enjoyer of Life . It was a cruelly ironic comment on his actual career , one which he did not accept himself but never effectively contradicted . " <P> Sense of Balance . Eight years ago , with an imposing biography of Lytton Strachey , Holroyd ( now 41 ) became one of our best guides to the cultural life of England in the early 20th century . No one of his generation has done more to clarify the achievements and emotional imbrications of the Bloomsbury group , or to deflate its more self-enchanted pieties . A great deal of the truth about a society lies in the lives of its minor artists . To write about them without falling into postures of condescension , gossip or overpraise is one of the toughest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , a close eye for social nuance and a sense of balance which not many biographers possess . Holroyd has it all , and Augustus John is his ideal quarry .
