txt Letters to the Editor pg . 38 Letters to the Editor On Selling City Notes Directly to the Public To the Editor : In a Feb. 3 news article you reported that Controller Goldin was seriously considering an iuea to sell municipal mites directly to the public , that Mayor Beame was receptive to such a program and that the offices of the OffTrack Betting Corporation were considered as possible outlets for the sale of such notes , which would be issued in denominations of $1,000 . During the twelve years of the last Wagner and the two Lindsay administrations the funded debt of . the city rose from about S5 billion to $10-billion . This funded debt teas the first lien on all revenues of the city . It is financed by bonds , over 70 per cent of which are turned over every ten years . In addition to this funded debt , New York City also maintains a so-called temporary debt , which , since Wagner 's third term , increased from petty cash proportions to over $5 billion . When the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it possible that any community would not only exhaust its long-term borrowing power ( funded debt ) but also contract a temporary debt of a size equal to 35 per cent of its total annual budget . Here is not the place to discuss the tremendous pressures on reform mayors to spend , spend and spend , nor to question the methods by which these policies were financed . Suffice it to say that questions are being raised as to the conflicting guarantee which backs up city bonds and notes . There will be no end to the budgetary The Violent Ones To the Editor : Now that he has shot a policeman and killed another citizen ( news story Jan. 30 ) , Raymond Tubar will presumably be kept out of circulation for a long time . I 'm glad to hear that , but it seems a little late , like closing the barn door after the horse is gone . Far down in your story was the information that this young man , though only nineteen years old , had been arrested fourteen times before going berserk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these arrests were for robbery with a weapon , three more for assault . I suggest that anyone so clearly disposed to violence has a dangerously high potential for further and more deadly violence , and should somehow and somewhere be isolated from the rest of us . What was-this man doing on Eighth Street ? PETER VAN METRE New York , Jan. 30 , 1975 A Case Against Guns To the Editor : I would like to . answer John M. Snyder 's letter of January 31 , in which he terms " ridiculous " The Times ' advocacy of effective gun-control legislation . Take an extreme case : Assume that an atomic bomb could be purchased by any citizen . They too are " inanimate objects , " and , if used maliciously , there could perhaps be " public action against killers " as the " proper response . " Where does Mr. Snyder wish to draw the line , and by what rationale should handguns be sanctioned and machine-guns be prohibited ? The difference is one of degree , and the victim of either is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands  --  facilitates killing , that should be sufficient cause for its abolition by a civilized society . EDWARD EARLY Stamford , Conn. , Jan. 31 , 1975 In Defense of the Regents To the Editor : Your Jan. 28 editorial on " State and Campus " raises specters of unseemly bureaucratic control of our universities which I for nne have not perceived . The Regents ' current effort ; to determine the quality of doctoral programs were preceded by careful planning and maximum opportunities for the university community to participate in molding both the purpose and the process . A distinguished commission headed by President Robin Fleming of Michigan sensibly and sensitively laid the groundwork for the Regents ' evaluation . The procedures to be followed were drafted ' openly and with the full participation of the academic community . It is difficult to fault the manner in which this project was developed or the openness of the Commissioner and his associates in implementing it . A historic function of the Regents has been to insure the quality of the state 's educational effort at all levels . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through registration or through master plan approvals . Certainly , we can not argue and financial crisis for this and any succeeding city administration until the powers that are in control here and in Albany confront unflinchingly the problem of the temporary debt . The current crisis results from the fact that the wealthy , who are supposed to be hungry fur tax-exempt income and who walk through life surrounded by lawyers and investment counselors , are no longer willing to roll over their city bonds and notes ; they fear for the safety of their principal . The giant institutions , insurance companies , pension funds and such find themselves in the same boat ; their managers arc afraid that they will be charged with neglect of their fiduciary duties if they continue to lend money to a city overburdened with debt and with rapidly shrinking revenues . Granted that investment advisers and lawyers occasionally have given their clients bum advice . However , easy solutions , easily arrived at , will not solve the most profound and perplexing financial and political problems . When the sophisticates run for shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw his hard-earned savings from savings banks in order to put them into city notes ? Is this the time to contemplate expensive TV advertising programs to lure him into O.T.B. parlors , where he shall be welcomed by Mayor Beame and Controller Goldin as the " city financier of last resort " ? GERALD S. JEREMIAS New York , Feb. 4 , 1975 The writer , an investment adviser , is vice president of the City Club of New . York . Victor : 11ildSZ Amtrak 's Husband Plan To the Editor : On Jan. 14 The Times carried an announcement of the extension of Amtrak 's family-rate plan to medium-distance runs . While this extension is welcomed , the wording of the plan indicates that at best there is ambiguity , at worst discrimination . The plan stipulates that the husband pay full fare and the wife and children reduced amounts . In a call to the Amtrak Passenger Service , I requested the rates for a husband and wife and two children where the wife would pay full fare , this being a work-related trip for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied on the grounds that it deviated from the prescribed plan . Is it not time for Amtrak to afford equal advantages to either spouse ? And should not female heads of households without husbands also have similar rights ? If the wording of the plan is ambiguous , so that families with other than the traditional wage-earning arrangements can be penalized , the wording should be clarified . If the plan is discriminatory , it should be amended . J. B. WILLIAMSON New York , Jan. 28 , 1975 that the Regents ' authority to approve or disapprove programs on their judgment of institutional potential ' does not extend to approving or disapproving programs on the basis of institutional performance . Although procedural problems and confusion about criteria have arisen in me early program evaluations , Commissioner Nyquist has responded with the same willingness to correct and clarify that has always characterized his relations with the state 's higher education community . I am convinced that the doctoral evaluations to date have been con : ducted thoughtfully and honestly and that program quality has been the controlling criterion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars in relevant disciplines and not the judgments of the State Department of Education . This is the manner in which the academy traditionally monitors its performance . Even if it hurts at times , the universities and the public arc well served by the Regents ' concern for academic quality . ROBERT J. KIBBEE Chancellor , The City University New York , Jan. 31 , 1975 Of Saigon Aid and Dulles ' ' Evangelism Syndrome* . To the Editor : President Ford , in asking Congress on Jan. 2S to appropriate $522 rai in additional aid to South Vietnam and Cambodia , said that " we can not turn our back on these embattled countries . " Unwillingness to provide adequate assistance to " allies fighting for their lives , " he said , " would seriously affect our credibility . . . " This is the John Foster Dulles ' evangelism syndrome . In January of . 1953 , upon becoming Secretary of State , Dulles broadcast : " To all those suffering under Communist slavery , tothe intimidated and weak peoples of . the world , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so we foughtthe Korean war to an end in 1953 and now , nearly 22 years later , the repressive South Korean regime is found still counting on us ( and particularly .. on the U.S. forces still garrisoned in that country ) . We committed ourselves to the cause of Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese Communists in 1945 and aided his. , side during the civil war that ended with the overthrow of the Nationalist regime , and in 1954 Dulles signed -a treaty of alliance with the National , Government in its refuge on Taiwan . Now , two decades later , Washing% ton feels that it can not abrogate the treaty to enable us to establish normal diplomatic relations with the People 's Republic of China , for fear of damag- . ing our " credibility . " Generalissimo Chiang can count on us . We fought our Vietnam war 1961 to 1973 for the benefit of the autocratic Saigon regime , at the cost of $150-. billion and many American and Indochinese lives  --  with shattering effects for the American economy and to the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thieu'soppressive government unswervingly . ( and lavishly ) since the Nixon Administration achieved that " peace with honor " in January 1973 and retired our troops from the battlefield . Yet now , with the American econ-. omy depressed , with a looming budget : deficit of tens of billions of dollars , and with vital international tasks fac- , ing us , the American nation is again being called upon to save the South Vietnamese regime from the natural ? consequences of its misrule . Are there no limits to how much . counterrevolutionary Asian regimes can count on us ? " How long , 0 Lord , how long ? " 0 . EDMUND CLUBB New York , Jan. 30 , 1975 The writer is former director of the ' State Department 's Office of Chinese . Affairs . ? Dacca : A Tit of Hope ' To the Editor : I am writing with reference.to your Jan. 30 editorial on Sheik Mujib 's as- sumption of total power in Bangladesh ( " One Man 's Basket Case " ) . While normally sympathize with and support The Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go too far , in suggesting that Mujib 's move would " close . . . off . . . the orderly emergence of new leaders and ideas . " Bangladesh today is not only totally bankrupt economically , it has in three years so totally drawn down on a17 ready meager reserves of will , constructive thought and self-confidence that it is most unlikely any Western ' , style models for a democratic marketplace of free ideas could provide last , minute relief . You are , however , eminently correct that Mujib and the Awami League , his ruling party , bear much of the responsibility for the last three years ' anguished decline from poverty arid hope to poverty and despair . His act of desperation in itself does not presage a turn-around in this decline , for it may only be desperation , the last step apparent to a fearful leader of limited vision . But if Mujib 's assumption of new powers implies a muchbelated willingness to use constructively and courageously the powers he already was effectively ceded three years ago by virtue of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiniest bit of hope . For only if the new President decides to by-pass the corruption and inefficiency of his middle-class party leaders , and deal honestly and directly with the masses who once worshipped him , is there any chance of re-instilling confidence , optimism , and determination in those  --  leaders and led  --  who must fight the worst odds in modern history to save a nation , Even so ' it may be too late ; without the exercise of real leadership , whatever the political model for its manifestation , it surely is . C. STEPHEN BALDwni New York , Jan. 30 , 1975 The writer lived in Dacca in 1971 .. Superfluous Agency To the Editor : Your editorial of Jan. 26 on the Office of Telecommunications Policy gave three alternatives on what the Ford Administration might do with this agency . Why , when the Federal Government should be cutting expenses to de= crease the Federal debt , should $9.3-million be spent on this unnecessary duplication ? Therefore , your third al. - ternative seems very appropriate : Abolish it . EDWARD W. TAYLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
