NIA HUANCA <P> by FAUSTINO GONZALEZ-ALLER Translated by MARGARET SAVERS PEDEN 243 pages . Viking . $10 . <P> <P> There is a standing joke among journalists that the world will do anything for Latin America except read about it . The general curiosity seems to end with fourth-grade geography and the fact that Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable body of water on earth . Yet this vast land mass , drooping from North America like some ripe , unplucked fruit , has produced some of this century 's major poets and novelists : Peru 's Cesar Vallejo , Chile 's Pablo Neruda , Argentina 's Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel Garca Mrquez of Colombia . <P> Faustino Gonzalez-Aller is a Spaniard , a journalist and screenwriter who has returned to his native 4and after years of living and working in Central America and New York City . Like so many of today 's serious novels , his Nia Huanca seems to have been shaped by the experiences of migration and cultural isolation . Modern Hispanic novelists have had the good fortune to share many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social and political injustice , gaping class divisions and a religious sense of the land and peasantry . Nia Huanca is yet another powerful example of what happens when a talented writer handles such ageless material with the spontaneous techniques of 20th century fiction . <P> Much of the novel is set in a fictitious Central American republic , a territory of the mind that has lately received many tourists . Joan Didion exercised her talents there in A Book of Common Prayer . Garca 3 's The Autumn of the Patriarch also took place in such a Central American dreamscape . Nia Huanca strikes similar social and political chords , but Gonzalez-Aller also seeks the high notes of myth and the mysteries of human motives . <P> Colonel Felix Arruza is a grotesque banana republic Zeus who is fond of procreating with comely peasant girls while his wife takes on the palace guard . Among Arruza 's numerous offspring is Miguel Angel Matalax Yanama , a 28-year-old wanderer who has studied law at Harvard and social science in Germany . He has lost an eye as a U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher and a Red Cross worker in Biafra . But Matalax has eaten the bitter bread of illegitimacy and plans to over throw his dictator-father . <P> As in the Greek myth of the castration of Uranus , the rebellious son has the help of his mother . Nia Huanca , raped by Colonel Arruza when she was 17 , is a figure of legendary proportions . <P> As the captain of her own freighter , she lives outside history - obeying only the tides , stars , wind , and her own biological urges . She is also rich , and her mon ey supports Matalax 's revolutionary plot , a wild , complex scheme that includes recruiting look-alikes to replace Colonel Arruza &; Co . <P> Author Gonzalez-Aller uses flash backs , lyricism , internal monologues and bitter wit to project his vision of cor ruption , revolution and revenge . Lusts , loyalties and betrayals are as entwined as jungle vines . Ideals and dreams are trampled , only to emerge again . History has no beginning , middle and end , only a cycle of birth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
