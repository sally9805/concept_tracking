 | For an unusual vaction -- go exploring When you feel like the world 's filling up with concrete , cars , cats and noise , go exploring ! Spend your vacation in a place that 's so remote maybe nobody has ever set foot there before . Certainly , nobody 's going to trample on your feet while you stand gazing over wilderness only an adventuresome few have ever seen . You do n't have to grab a slow freighter to the Amazon to find places that are still unexplored . Start in your U.S.A. I asked two past presidents of the famed Explorers Club , Russ Gurnee and Serge Korff , to see if maybe there was a spot or two within our borders that they considered virtually unexplored . They recommended plenty of places , coast to coast . Some are woodland areas that can be explored on foot or with the help of a car ( preferably fourwheel drive ) . Others are rocky desert-like wildernesses ; for these , a vehicle is a must . Still other areas can be explored by boat : perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outboard . There are also a number of caves , and some remote hot springs and natural bridges that offer the exploring vacationer a sense of real solitude . These areas are all located on our map and many are described in detail toward the end of this article . I was tickled when Gurnee told me that the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York state are about the largest unexplored region in this country . I 've had a love affair with the Adirondacks for years . When I hike there , I often start out on marked trails , and even then , I 've been able to walk for a full day without meeting another human being , or even kicking an old beer can . Once I leave the trails , there 's no telling what I 'll discover . One day I was headed up Pharaoh Mountain , a mere 30 miles north of the gaudy , noisy resort town of Lake George . About halfway up , I paused for a breather . There 's a strong wind blowing across Pharaoh all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with the rustling wind . I struck out into the thickets of birch , cedar , and balsam tress , following that water sound . Eureka ! I came across one of the finest small waterfalls I 've ever seen . My waterfall is n't on any published maps . Even the forest rang-@# @#  | er who walks up and down Pharaoh every week did n't know it was hidden in the woods until I sketched it onto his own topo map . Exploration gear If you decide to go exploring , you 're going to need some basic equipment . Most important are a good compass and good topographic maps . Learn how to use them long before you head into the wilderness PS , July ' 75 . Forget your notions about Tarzan-type explorers . You do n't have to carry your supplies on your back or pack them on the heads of native bearers . In fact , backpacking is n't always suited to exploration . First , there wo n't be any stores near most wilderness areas . Backpacking explorers would have to carry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a load , unless you like to survive on really basic dried foods . Like many explorers , I tote a lot of hobby-type equipment . I 'm never without at least two Nikons , often three . And I usually carry a heavy tripod . Sometimes I pack a movie camera , too . With extra lenses and film , that 's a full backpack already , without living supplies . Many explorers like to carry a good set of wildlife-identification books , plenty of specimen jars , rock-sampling hammers , sketch pads , butterfly nets . But if you 're an experienced backpacker who wants to tackle the challenge of exploring from your back , standard backpack gear is what you need ? the bigger the better . In some areas you have n't any choice but to set up base camp in your own or a rented tent : There simply are n't any commercial commodations around . General ' . you 're permitted to build a can : : fire , but check state or federal reg .. lations . When in doubt , carry your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally okay , don count on it . Take along drinking water in jerry cans or collapsible plastic jugs , unless you really e joy boiling water or tasting chemically purified " natural " water . If you plan to use a Styrofoa ice chest for your fresh food . fi it with plenty of dry ice , keep well shaded in camp , and don plan on the ice to last more th three or four days ? five at the most . High-topped hiking boots are a must in woods and rocks . You may not encounter any snakes , but if you do , you might not know if the serpents are poisonous or no ' until it 's a few seconds too late For the same reason , wear lone pants . Long-sleeved shirts keep off bugs in the woods and sun in the desert . I wear the same floppy hat both places , and in the woods I smoke a corn-cob pipe full of the worst-smelling tobacco around . That keeps the bugs off without my having to soak in those oily , stinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical insect repellent since you ca n't know what bugs you 'll find ? or how many . Make sure you have a snake-bite kit along , and learn how to use it in advance . A good first-aid kit is a must , too . Beyond that , it 's pretty much a matter of packing standard camping supplies . Strategy for exploring Do n't go alone . You 'll be shoving into areas where other people do n't often go . If you get into trouble or get hurt , you and your friends have to take care of the Continued on page 148 @#  | problem , without any outside help . Let somebody know where you 're going and when you plan to come back . It might be a motel manager , a local ranger , the sheriff in a nearby town , or anybody who 's responsible enough to send help if you do n't return at the prearranged time . It helps if you leave a duplicate map with your itinerary clearly marked . Pick ? and use ? your transportation carefully . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes , or rugged inflatable rafts with or without motor . I personally prefer to work a little harder on the water than to put up with the incessant noise of an outboard . In desert regions , a four-wheeldrive vehicle is the only way to move very far off the highways PS , March . Four-wheel drives are also ideal for navigating the fire lanes and timber trails in woodland areas . These " roads " are too tough for campers and trailers , but your family car can handle many of them if you learn how to drive all over again . Be sure to check with local authorities before driving on such trails ; sometimes they are off-limits to motor vehicles . And stow an axe , shovel , and some rope in your vehicle 's trunk , along with a good spare tire and jack . A couple of miles an hour is plenty fast on timber trails . You ca n't let the springs bounce up and down or you 'll probably bottom out . Check mud puddles with a stick before you drive over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking Pikeville , Ky. , and ended up with an oil pan on solid ground but four wheels sunk in what had looked like a shallow puddle . A truckload of men from a nearby ranger station finally helped me , much wiser , out of the mud . Navigation tactics When I 'm looking around some new part of the country , sometimes I head for a landmark that catches my eye on a topo map . That 's simple . Find out where you are at the start , then follow a compass course to the place . Getting back to your base camp can be a lot harder , however . It 's not as prominent as that lake or mountain . That 's a mighty good @# @# reason to set up your tent or your vehicle along a trail or b That way you can head you back to a spot slightly up the or upstream from base camp . you reach the brook or road , y know which way to go . If you pinpoint navigation you 're apt learn what a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to tramp through a 100-y square of woods looking for my tent . Another tactic I like to use is follow a river or creek . I wan quite a distance away from the ter at times , but I usually keep within sight or earshot . When I 'm about halfway to my limit of energy or time , I cross and head bad on the other side , reminding myself on the way back to watch as for a fork in the river . If you 're in a wilderness where everything looks alike , you mid have to work out a grid on your map . Draw a line from your star ing point , let 's say due north . there are landmarks somewhere along the way , even low hills that show as contours on a topo man .. you can end the line there . Other wise , plan on turning after an hour or two . Turn due west for another hour or two , then head straight south until you hit the road , trail , or creek bed that you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body should be in pretty good condition if you plan to travel really deep into unexplored regions . Take the time to get ycut mind ready , too . I 've seen a lot of physically fit people leave their offices on Friday afternoon , head to the woods for a vacation , only t find themselves so pooped mentally they ca n't concentrate . They fall over rocks , slip into creeks , forget how to sight a compass , and wish they 'd never started out . For them . I 'd advise a couple days ' rest by a motel pool before tackling the wilds . Do n't assume your young children are great little troopers until you 've seen them perform in the field . Kids who are tough in a patch of weeds down the block often fall apart in a dark woods . If you want to take your kids exploring , why not " go caving , " suggests former Explorers Club president Russ Gurnee ' ? " Lots of beautiful caves are found in state parks all over the country . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good proving ground : You can find out whether remote places are really your thing . "  | Here are some tales and details But a number of the areas Gur-e and Korff have singled out as rime candidates for exploration . Rocky wildernesses Northeast Nevada ( Elko county ) c ' d Southeast Utah ( San Juan , Jane , Garfield , Wayne counties ) . Serge Korff flew over these largely desert regions recently and is itching to get back there on the ground . I 'd recommend that people set p a base camp in some nearby motel , " he says . " It gets pretty uncomfortable out in those regions . " ( In the Friendship Inns directory , you can find motels in Moab , Monticello , and Mexican Hat , Utah . They 're all along U.S. Highway 163 . Same directory shows motels in Wells and Elko , Nev. , on U.S. 40 . ) " And the topographic maps are of limited use , " Korff cautions ; " I 've seen some mining roads marked on the topo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing left but sand . " Data on many topo maps are 10 to 20 years old . Woodlands Smoky Mountains ( Tennessee and North Carolina ) . This is one of the most-used camping and hiking areas in the East . Trouble is , everybody seems to stay on the marked trails . Serge Korff says that he 's just beginning to find out what attractions lie off the paths in the Smokies . With a smile he warns , " Be careful : Some of the natives off the trail might think you 're after their moonshine . " A few otherwise daring outdoors types have told me they would n't venture out of the well-peopled parts of the Smokies because of the bears there . I 'd say that was a darned good reason in favor of getting off the tourist trails . So-called wildlife is n't very wild once you get away from tourist areas . I swear a porcupine once laughed at me when I almost stepped on her in the midst of her daily sunbath . She would n't move , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135mm lens , I 've managed to get fantastic close-up photos of all kinds of wildlife . Idaho 's Sawtooth Mountains . Here 's an area that 's full of wildlife all summer ? and wild skiers all winter . But that means there are motels within easy reach along U.S. 93 . Public campsites are nearby too . Maine-Quebec border . If you want to tramp in woods that seem like the very end of the world , head for this area . You wo n't find @# @# a Holiday Inn within a day 's drive . No soft public campsites either . Quebec Highway 24 , about the only access road , runs within 10 miles of the border , and it 's not paved all the way . So bring plenty of food in your car , pitch your tent , then day-trip into regions that have n't even been well mapped . Names here are as picturesque as the scenery . Oregon-Washington border . The eastern end of the border is almost as remote as the Maine wilderness . You will find a few prepared campsites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering an outboard turns you on , you can explore from the water . Let me offer you some advice you 've probably heard a hundred times already . Wear life vests no matter how easy the going may seem . Shed your boots and tie them inside the raft ; barefoot , you 're an instant swimmer in an emergency . I even calculate how many supplies will get me back to civilization , pack them into a waterproof bag , and tie that to a separate life vest . That way , even if all other supplies land at the bottom of some lake , I 've a floating emergency pack to get me home . Lake Chelan , northern Washington . This is one of Serge Korff 's favorite places . " You can drive to the southern part of the lake on state Highway 97 . But you ca n't reach the northern end of the lake except by boat , airplane , or on foot . " Renting a boat on Lake Chelan is quite easy these days . One enterprising guide even runs a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Angle ( Minnesota , Ontario , Manitoba ) . Right at the border is the Northwest Angle . " You can get to Warroad , Minn. , on state Highway 11 , " Korff says . " Then you have to rent a boat or take the ferry , which leaves irregularly during the summer . But it 's worth any wait . Appropriately , the Indians named that whole part of the world Lake of the Woods . " Adirondack Mountains ( New York ) . Although they 're close to densely populated areas , the Adirondacks offer vast expanses of pristine woods and streams . And if you ever hike up Pharaoh Mountain , perhaps you 'll come across my waterfall . Or better still , discover one of your own . @#
