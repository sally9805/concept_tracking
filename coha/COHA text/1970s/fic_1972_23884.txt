a story by Margaret Atwood UNDER GLASS ' M FEELING BETTER . For once the sky is out , I there 's a breeze , I 'm walking through the ellipses and arranged vistas of the park , the trees come solidly up through the earth as though they belong there , nothing wavers . I have confidence in the grass and the distant buildings , they can take care of themselves , they do n't need my attention on them to keep them together , my eyes holding them down . The steam-covered mothers and shrill , hyperthyroid children of yesterday 's trip to the zoo are far away , the traces they have left in me are faint as grease smudges and scratchings of twigs on windowpanes . That was a risk I should n't have taken , it would have been cleverer to have waited , but I managed it . I even made it through the Moonlight Pavilion , darkened tunnels lull of screaming , the goggling rodents and shrunken fetal-headed primates deluded by the gray light into going about their lives , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do it without anyone to help . I pass the 7-B greenhouse : it glitters , it beckons . Inside are the plants that look like stones , their fleshy lobed leaves knuckle-sized and mottled so that they blend perfectly with the pebbles . I was pleased at first to have discovered them . I think with a kind of horror at myself of the hours I 've spent watching them , all of us keeping quite still . Today , however , the greenhouse has no attraction : I walk on two legs , I wear clothes . In the street outside the station I go shopping . It feels new , my legs ripple as though I 've just gotten out of a wheelchair . I buy little brown paper parcels and stow them away inside my serviceable black bag with handles on it like a doctor 's . Bread and butter , grapes , greengages that he has probably never had before but we must all try different experiences . Before I zip the bag I rearrange the packages to safeguard the rose , encased in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redundant . It 's a gift though and I 'm proud of myself for being able , we do n't do much of that . I cut it in the garden , which is n't mine . I admire roses but I 've never wanted ' to be one , maybe that 's why I 'm not worrying much about whether the stem hurts . What part of a rose bush is the body ? Last night I dreamed 1 had a baby that was the right size and color . It 's a healthy sign , maybe be able to after all , the way other women are supposed to . Usually when I dream of babies they are scrawny as kittens , pale-greenish and highly intelligent ; they talk in polysyllables and I know they are n't mine but are creatures from another planet , sent to take over the earth , ort that they are dead . Sometimes they 're covered with fur . But last night 's was pink and reassuringly illiterate , it cried . He ought to find this promising , he wants to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even gone so far as to read a couple of books on exercises and what they call natural childbirth . though having a gourd or a tomato would surely be more pleasant and useful these days than having a baby , the world has nc need of my genes . That 's an excuse though . I put the bag on my knees and keep hold of the handles . It 's playing house , we both know I ca n't cook him anything till he gets his stove re paired , which somehow he postpones ; still it ' : the first domestic thing I 've ever done for him He ought to approve , he 's obliged to approve he 'll see it 's getting better . I 'm feeling so good even look at other people in the train , their face : and clothes , noticing them , wondering abou their lives . See how kind I am , what a cornu copia . T HE CEMENT STAIRWAY going down to hi door smells of piss and antiseptic ; I hold m-breath as usual . I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I let myself in with my key . Hi two-room flat is more untidy than last time Int it 's been worse . Today the dust and litter lean my skin alone . I set my black hag on the tabl and go through to the bedroom . He 's on the bed , asleep in a tangled net blankets , on his back with his knees up . I 'm a ways afraid to wake him : I remember the stories about men who kill in their sleep with their eyes open , thinking the woman is a burglar or an enemy soldier . You ca n't be convicted for it . I touch him on the leg and stand hack , ready to run , but he wakes immediately and turns his head toward me . " Hi , " he says . " Jesus / 'm hung over . " It 's rude of him to be hung over when I 've : : ome all this way to see him . brought you a lower , " I say , determined to be calm and cheer- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ose from its toilet paper and look for something . o put it in . There 's a stack of never-used plates n his cupboard , the rest of the space is books tnd papers . I find a lone glass and fill it with vater at the sink . Forks and knives , also unised , are rusting in the drainer . I list to myself he things he needs : a vase , more glasses , a dish owel . I carry the rose in to him and he sniffs at it hitifully and I set the glass beside the alarm lock on the improvised table , two chairs and a . oard . He would really like to go back to sleep , . ut he compromises by pulling me down beside im and involving me in the blankets . His head eeks the hollow between my shoulder and coltrbone and he closes his eyes . " I 've missed you , " he says . Why should he ave missed me , I 've only been gone five days . The last good , I wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cupboard , not his , prior to him . He kisses me : he does have a hangover , his mouth tastes of used wine , tobacco resin , and urban decay . He does n't want to make love , I can tell , I stroke his head understandingly ; he nuzzles . I think again of the Moonlight Pavilion , the slow loris creeping cautiously through its artificial world , water dishes and withering branches , its eyes large with apprehension , its baby clutched to its fur . " Want to have lunch ? " This is his way of telling me he 's in no shape . " I brought it . Or most of it anyway . go round the corner and get the rest . It 's healthier than those greasy hamburgers and chips . " " Great , " he says , but he makes no move to get up . " Have you been taking your vitamin pills ? " They were my idea , I was afraid he 'd get scurvy , eating the way he does . I always take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see whether he 's telling the truth , I turn over so I 'm looking down at him . " Who were you drinking with ? Did you go out after you moved the furniture ? " " The furniture was already moved when I got there . She could n't call to tell me . " That 's true , he has no phone ; our conversations take place in booths . " She wanted to go out and drink instead . I spilled chop suey all over myself , " he says with self-pity . I am supposed to commiserate . " Was it digested or undigested ? " I ask . " I had n't touched a bite of it . " I 'm surprised at her for being so obvious , but then she 's always seemed unsubtle , blunt , and straightforward , captain of a women 's basketball team , no , high-school gym teacher with whistle in mouth . An old friend . No nonsense . Mine had bloomers and skinny legs and made jokes about what she called The Cramps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Trampolines , the body contorted , made to perform , the mind barking orders . " She 's been trying to seduce you for mouths , " I say , smiling ; the thought amuses me , she looks like a marmot . At this he tries to shrug , but I have him pinned , one arm across the neck . " Did she succeed ? " " By the time we got out of the bar the subway was closed . " I had n't been serious , but this is suddenly a confession . I want to ignore it but I go on . " You mean she spent the night here ? " " As opposed to trying to get all the way back to her place . " he says , " yes . " It would be a reason like that . Logical as hell . What do you think you are , the YWCA , I want to say , but instead I ask the obvious . " I suppose you slept with her. - My voice is steady , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was her idea . I was drunk . " He thinks both these things are good excuses . " Why did you tell nier If he had n't told me and I 'd found out I 'd say Why did n't you tell me ? I know this while I 'm asking it . " You could have figured it out for yourself , the alarm 's set for eight . " " What clots that mean ? " I say ; I do n't connect . I 'm cold , I get up off the bed and move backward toward the doorway . I AM SITTING in a brand-new hamburger palace ; across the table from me is a man eating a cheeseburger . Feeding places are the only chances I have to watch him : the rest of the time I 'm looking at the blurs through taxi windows or tracing the unfamiliar wallpaper designs . The color of his face matches the formica tabletops : off-white . At other tables are other men , also eating cheeseburgers and being watched by other women . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock music and the smell of exhausted french fries . Though it is winter the room reminds me of a beach , even to the crumpled paper napkins and pop bottles discarded here and there and the slightly gritty texture of the cheeseburgers . He pushes away his cole slaw . " You should eat it , " I say . " No no ; ca n't eat vegies , " he says . The suppressed dietician in me notes that he is probably suffering from a vitamin A deficiency . I should have been a health inspector , or maybe an organic farmer . trade you then , " I say . " DI eat your cole slaw if you 'll finish my cheeseburger . " He thinks there 's a catch somewhere but decides to risk it . The switch is made and we both examine our halves of the deal . Beyond the plate-glass window slush drifts from the night sky ; inside , though , we are lighted , safe and warm . filtering music through our gills as though it 's oxygen . He finishes my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for some reason . though I ca n't recall which . I thumb my card file of nasty remarks , choose one : You make love like a cowboy raping a sheep . I 've been waiting for the right time to say that , but maybe peace is more important . Nut for him ; hunger satisfied , he turns back to an earlier argument . " You 're trying to see hov much shit Ill take , are n't you ? " he says . " Stoi treating me like a nine-year-old . " " There 's one good way to keep me from treat ing you like one , " I say . What I mean is that Is should stop acting like one , but he does ! u't bite In fact , he may not even have heard : the must is louder . " Let 's split , " he says , and we get up . I ehecl the cashier as we go out : cashiers fill me wit dismay , I want them to be happy but they neve are . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sound and too many Irene fries . She is apathetic rather than surly . Figl hack , I tell her silently . We hit the air and walk , not touching . I can remember what he did but he wo n't get awa with it . He 's wearing a long khaki army surph coat with brass buttons ; Ws handsome , but rigl now it only reminds me of my fear of doormei bus drivers , and postal officials , those who their uniforms as excuses . I steer my course so I will have to go through all the puddles . If ca n't win , I tell him , neither can you . I wz saner then , I had defenses . " I never get up at eight . She had to go work . " He 's conscious now that I 'm not goir to laugh with him over this one as I have over tl others . " If you 'd been here it would n't have ha pened , " he says , trying to put it off on me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he did , how he moved , what 1 said even , one warm body attracts another , i how people behave and I want to be sick . More want to take my carefully selected brown pap parcels and shove them down his never-clean toilet , which I even  --  crown of idiocy  --  h thoughts of cleaning for him , poor thing , one ever showed him how to do it . Where they belong . So this is what it would be like , me picking up his dirty socks and cigarette butts in my experienced way , woman 's greatest joy , safely eight months pregnant so you ca n't get out of it now , grunting away at the natural childbirth exercises while he 's off screwing whatever was propped against him when he hit the mystic number of drinks . A spiritual relationship with you , he said , and merely physical ones with the others . Shove that . What does he think I saw in him in the first place , his remarkable soul ? " I 'm going out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too visible here , desert mice with their burrows running down the side of the glass , what an intrusion I thought at the time . " Do you want me to come back ? " This is the call to repentance , he nods without speaking , he really is unhappy but I do n't Nave time to think about that , I have to get out where there are a lot more around me , camouiage . I 'm careful not to slam the door , I cross to he market street and dig in among the shoppers . T 'S A ROOM , WITH sea , dressing table surI mounted by mirror , night table plus lamp and elephone , linoleum patterned drapes covering vindows which in their turn cover the night and drop of ten stories to molten lights and metal ! arts , hall opening on bathroom which includes sink and two taps , hot and cold , closed door . ) utside the door is another hall and a line of similar closed doors . It is all correct , all in place hough silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep in the bed , with no success . ' ni going back and forth across the floor , raisig from the carpet an airport smell of upholstery leaner . Earlier there was a tray with steak rinds nd shreds of old salad on it , but I set it out in le hall a long time ago From time to time I open the windows and re room is inundated with traffic noise as though is part of a city-sized motor ; then I close the indows and the room heats again , internal cornustion engine . Sometimes I go into the bath-am and turn the taps on and off , taking drinks water and sleeping pills ; it gives me the ilia-on of action . I also look at my watch . It 's early wing , there are no leaves and no snow ; the days we too much sun , it shows the dust on everying , it hurts your eyes . Three hours ago he ioned to say lie would be home in half an hour . e speaks of this room where we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , I ppose because I 'm in it . I 'm in it and I ca n't t out , he has the key , where would I go , it 's a reign city . I work out plans : I 'll pack now , ive , he 'll come back after being  --  where is he ? could have been in an accident , he 's in the spital , he 's dying , no , he would never do it so atly . The room will be empty . The room isempty now , I 'm a place not a person . I 'll go into the bathroom , lock the door , lie down in the tub with my arms crossed in the lily position , eyes weighted with invisible pennies . I 'll wash down the rest of the sleeping pills and be found draped over something , the bureau , the telephone , in a coma . Their breathing is always described in murder mysteries as " stertorous , " I 've never known what that meant . He 'll come in just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid hurricane below , my nightgown spread out like a huge nylon kite . Hold on to the string , it 's tied to my head . The mechanisms of the room continue their clicking and gurgling , indifferent . I 've turned all the knobs on the heating unit but nothing happens , maybe I 'm not really here . He ought to be here , he has no right not to be here , this machine is his creation . I get back into the bed for the fifth or sixth time and try to concentrate on the shapes moving across my closed eyelids . Sun , dust , bright colors , headlights , a Persian carpet . There are pictures now , ducks oddly enough , a woman sitting in a chair , a lawn with a country house , Grecian portico and all , clocks made of flowers , a line of dancing cartoon mice , who put them there ? Whoever you are , get me out and I promise never never again . Next time it will be just from the neck down , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , you should have kept it that way , it 's the only thing you can handle . Cool it said the doctor , trying to communicate but coming through like Fred MacMurray in a Walt Disney family picture , take pills . Maybe he 's just asserting his freedom , you 're too possessive . He 's escaping . You 've driven him to it , into the phone booth and out comes Superstud . A self-propelling prick with a tiny brain attached to it like a termite 's , couple of drinks and he 'd stick it into anything . Like night-hunting snakes it has infrared sensors on the front end , in the dark it strikes at anything warm . When the lights went on he was fucking the hot air register . That 's unfair . What really annoys you is that she got it last night and there was n't any left for you . Why could n't he have chosen some other time ? He knew I 'd be there this morning . He did n't choose it , it just happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being with problems ? Do I ever do anything else ? Already I could n't tell you whether he 's my lover or my outpatient . You think you 're so magic , you can cure anything . Ca n't you admit you 've failed ? Maybe Pm not a confused human being with problems , maybe I 'm something altogether different , an artichoke . . . None of that . Actually she 's his type , they must have made it fine together , they 're both athletic , she keeps time with the whistle , peep ! they 're off .. In a way I admire her , she gets through the days . 7W HEN I COME BACK he 's dressed and miser- able . I move about the room in a parody of domesticity , savaging the bread into sandwiches with his one inadequate knife , sloshing bought over the fruit . I open the Pepsi I 've bougt him . " llo you have more than one glass ? " He shakes his head . " There 's only the one . " I bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the clothes hamper he uses for trash , rinse out the glass and pour half of the warm Pepsi into it for myself . That 's the nearest I can bring myself to physical anger . He starts to eat ; I ca n't . I 'm shivering ; I get his coat down from the hook and wrap myself up in it . " Do n't look at me like that , " he says . " Like what ? " I say . I 'm not allowed to he angry , he thinks it 's unfair . In fact Pm not angry , I 'm Hipping through my images , trying to find one that will save me from speaking the unforgivable , the words that ca n't be recalled . Tortoises in cement cubicles , the otters in their green-scummed pool , they were eating , hones and the head of something , no , what about the foxes ; they were barking , you could n't hear them but you could see the insides of their mouths . The echidnas , waddling through the sawdust like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plants , the water-lily house , and in greenhouse 12 , Victoria Amazonica with her huge plate-shaped leaves six feet across and her spiky blossom , floating in her pond , her harbor , doing nothing at all . " Look , " he says , " I ca n't stand these silences . " ' ' Then say something . " " Whatever I say you 'll think I 'm sinister . " " I do n't think you 're sinister , " I say , " I just think you 're thoughtless and stupid . Anyone clever would wait until after he 'd got the woman moved in with him before starting on that . " Part of him , I know , does n't want me to move in at all , the stove stays broken . Hang on to your defenses , I think ; you 'll be sunk without them . " I thought it was better to tell the truth right off . " I look at him : he 's hurting all right , but I need my mouthful of flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unhappy though and it is n't his fault , it 's just the way he is , accept me , accept my nervous tics , and he thinks that 's all it is , a kind of involuntary muscle spasm . I want to tell him now what no one 's ever taught him , how two people who love each other behave , how they avoid damaging each other , but I 'm not sure I know . The love of a good woman . But I do n't feel like a good woman right now . My skin is numb , bloodless as a mushroom . It was wrong of me to think I could ever accommodate ; he 's too human . " I 'll walk you to the subway . " He ca n't cope with it , he does n't believe in talking it through , FEBRUARY 1972 he wants me out of the way . He wo n't come near me , touch me , does n't he know that 's all he needs to do ? He 'll wait for me to cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away like this I wo n't be back . o uTstnE 1 PUT ON my sunglasses , though the sun has gone in . I walk severely , not looking at him , I ca n't bear to . The outlines are slipping again , it 's an effort to press the sidewalk down , it billows under my feet like a mattress . He really is going to take me to the subway and let me disappear without making any effort to stop me . I put my hand on his arm . " Do you want to talk about it ? " " You just want out , " he says , " and you 're using this as an excuse . " " That 's not true , " I say . " If I 'd wanted that excuse I could have used it before this . " We turn off toward the small park where there is a statue on horseback with a lot of pigeons . " You 're making too much of it , " he says . " You always exaggerate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . You had a few drinks and felt horny , that 's all . " " Very perceptive of you , " he says . He is n't being ironic , he thinks I 've had a genuine though rare insight . He leans forward and takes off my sunglasses so he can see me . " You ca n't hide behind those , " he says . The sun gets in and I squint ; his face swells , darkens , a paper flower dropped in water . He spreads tendrils ; I watch them creeping over my shoulder . " I wish I did n't love you , " I say . He smiles , his hair scintillating in the part light , his tie blossoming and receding , his fact oriental , inscrutable as an eggplant . I grip tht handles on my black bag , force him back tt snapshot dimensions . lie kisses my fingers ; he thinks we have al been cured . He believes in amnesia , he will neve mention it again . It should hurt less each time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stair to the ticket window . My hands function , ea changing round silver disks for oblong paper That this can he done , that everyone knows wha it means , there may be a chance . if we could d that : I would give him a pebble , a flower , h would understand , he would translate exact ) He would reply , he would give me .. . I ponder again his need for more glasses an consider buying him a large bath towel . Once o the train , though , I find myself being moved gra ( ually , station by station , back toward the 7 - greenhouse . Soon I will be there ; inside are ti-plants that have taught themselves to look lit stones . I think of them ; they grow silently , hidir in dry soil , minor events , little zeros , containir nothing but themselves ; no food value , to ti eye soothing and round , then suddenly nowher I wonder how long it takes , how they do it .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
