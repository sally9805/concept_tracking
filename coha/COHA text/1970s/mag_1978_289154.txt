SAME TIME , NEXT YEAR Directed by Robert Mulligan Screenplay by Bernard Slade <P> One of the mysteries of the movie business is Hollywood 's predilection for filming hopelessly stagebound Broadway hits . Some plays transfer easily to the screen , but those built around theatrical gimmicks invariably drop dead . Same Time , Next Year , like last year 's Equus , never stood a chance as a movie : it is a one-joke , one-set , two-character sitcom that should be allowed to retire in peace to the nation 's dinner theaters . <P> The two characters are Doris ( Ellen Burstyn ) and George ( Alan Alda ) , strangers who meet at a motel and end up in bed . Though married to others , the hero and heroine continue their affair on a one-weekend-per-year basis . Luckily , Writer Bernard Slade monitors the couple at five-year rather than annual intervals . <P> <P> To alter the play 's design is to destroy it , so Director Robert Mulligan ( Bloodbrothers ) has changed virtually nothing . On Broadway , the curtain came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same Time , Next Year is pockmarked by photomontages that allegedly set up the story 's different periods . Yet Mulligan 's faithfulness to the text only reveals the flaws in Same Time , Next Year . <P> Almost every moment in the script rings false . Why do the lovers scrupulously avoid each other 363 days a year ? For no reason other than to preserve the writer 's one-set gimmick . Why do the adulterers profess so much affection for each other 's spouse and kids ? So that old-fashioned audiences wo n't be too threatened by the couple 's yearly transgressions . Slade is a classic practitioner of the **29;6648;TOOLONG school of Broadway dramaturgy . He seems to be saying that a carefully circumscribed adultery will actually improve a marriage , but who in real life can control their passions as well as Doris and George ? Same Time , Next Year is full of such hypocrisy ; Slade 's only real aim is to pander to his audience 's most bankrupt fantasies . <P> What pushes Same Time , Next Year from silliness into bad taste is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and sex for cheap one-liners , but he also manages to plunder the social history of three decades . In Slade 's hands , even the Viet Nam War is a cue for hokey costume gags and mechanical changes of dramatic pace . The man has no shame . <P> The only dignity in the film comes from Ellen Burstyn , who skillfully recreates her stage role . Playing the part originated by Charles Grodin , Alda gives a surprisingly weak performance : his usual warmth is vitiated by too many shrill farcical tantrums . Still , it 's hard to blame an actor for this debacle . The only way to win playing Same Time , Next Year is to refuse to play it at all . <P> - Frank Rich
