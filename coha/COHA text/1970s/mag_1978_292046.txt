When the President signs a bill , the White House traditionally invites interested Congressmen to the Oval Office for ceremonial photographs . So it was last week with the black-lung bill to increase benefits for disabled coal miners , and among the invited legislators was Democratic Congressman Dan Flood of Pennsylvania . For Flood , who is under investigation for numerous influence-peddling schemes , the chance for some flackery instead of flak was a godsend . Flood showed up early at the Oval Office and anchored himself behind the presidential chair . Party leaders began jostling to get the Congressman off center stage . No words were spoken . Flood , grabbing the chair tightly , would not budge . <P> When Carter appeared , he sized up the problem and mumbled to Flood that he had been reading about him in the papers . Then he signed the bill . And Flood got his picture taken .
