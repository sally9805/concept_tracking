txt Secretary of State William P. Rogers today indicated that American air support can not be ruled out for South Vietnamese forces should they drive into North Viet Nam . Such support , he told a television interviewer , would require the approval of President Nixon and none is now under consideration . Asked if he could rule it out , Rogers replied , " We do n't rule it in " and added : " There 's no reason for our side to always tell the enemy exactly what 's going to happen for the foreseeable future . " South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky have repeatedly suggested to newsmen the possibility of such an invasion by their forces . President Nixon in a televised press conference last Thursday went , out of his way to express understanding for the strategic position that would justify it . Today Rogers admitted that the possibility of such an invasion may have been linked to the visit last Friday to Hanoi by Chinese Premier Chou En-lai who apparently , he said , sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The presence of supply experts in the Chinese party also suggested that Peking may be making up some of the losses the North Vietnamese have suffered during the disruption of their supply lines thru Laos , Rogers said . The secretary said the United States does not see an increased threat of Chinese participation in the war , but admitted that " you can never be sure about the Communist Chinese . " Calls Threat Propaganda Rogers termed propaganda Chou 's remarks that China had made " adequate preparations " in view of what he called a serious threat inherent in the Laotian operation . Chou went to Hanoi , Rogers said on educational TV , because the Laotian operation is successful and is causing concern . But Peking must know that the United States is withdrawing from Indochina and therefore does not represent a threat . Rogers appeared to tie total withdrawal of American forces from Viet Nam to a negotiated settlement of the war which he said the Communists would be willing to conclude " somewhere along the line . " He confirmed , however , that prisoners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that when the prisoners were released , all U. S. troops would leave . Re refused to be drawn out on how long that may take or how many Americans would be left in Viet Nam by next year . He also refused to be pinned down on bow the prisoners question would be solved , barring a negotiated settlement . Weighs U. N. Question That , he said , " presents a very difficult problem , and we 're going to do what we can . " The United States , Rogers said , is considering  --  but has not yet decided  --  what to do if Communist China this year or next were given a seat in the United Nations . President Nixon has said the U : S. would not approve a seat for Red China if it meant expulsion of Nationalist China . Neither government wants to participate alongside the other . Referring to criticism by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that the President 's policy makers  --  meaning Special Adviser Henry Kissinger , not Rogers ? were exempt from questioning , Rogers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy over a war policy it can not change . He was not directly confronted with the remark by Sen. Stuart Symington D. , Mo. that Rogers is a laughing stock because of Kissinger , not Rogers , is dominant in the formulation of foreign policy . Would Accept Top Job Commenting that be did not feel as unpopular as he had expected to feel in office , the secretary of state jokingly said be was willing to be considered for the Presidency . He had noted that secretaries of state had often succeeded to the Presidency , and his questioner asked if he were making an announcement . " No , but I  --  you know  --  I 'm willing to be considered , " he said . " Well , that 's an announcement , " the questioner replied . " No , " Rogers said , " I 'm joking . " He went on to say his job was a difficult one and that he believed he was " fortunate in not being under too severe criticism . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
