Lang , a ten-year-old Vietnamese , supported himself and his grandmother by begging in the streets of a small village south of Danang . One day he found something to play with-a white phosphorous grenade . It exploded , killing his two brothers and blinding his grandmother . Nor was Lang spared . The phosphorus seared his face , creating a mask of horror that no Hollywood makeup man could fashion . It also burned away his eye sockets and eyelids , leaving him with large frightened eyes that he can not close . <P> Lang 's plight is anything but unique . There are anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 children like him in South Viet Nam . Some are the direct casualties of deadly ordnance fired by both sides . Others are indirect victims , burned while trying to use jet fuel for cooking , scarred by a wasting sickness called noma which is brought on by malnutrition , or crippled by other diseases that might be brought under control during peacetime . But Lang is a little luckier than most . He is being treated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only place in Viet Nam that can help large numbers of seriously disfigured or disabled child-casualties of the war . Said one of Lang 's doctors , <P> " He wo n't be beautiful , but at least he 'll be able to close his eyes . " <P> The unusual center was built by Children 's Medical Relief International , a private , New York-based organization , and is partially funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development . It was conceived in 1967 by Thomas Miller , now 34 , a lawyer and Peace Corps veteran who had read about young casualties and decided to do something to help them . Miller enlisted Dr. Arthur Barsky , 73 , the Manhattan plastic surgeon who had operated on women disfigured at Hiroshima , and the two visited Viet Nam later that year . The result of their trip was the creation of CMRI and an agreement from AID to help finance what is now called the Barsky Unit on the grounds of the Cho Ray Hospital . Its dual purpose : to treat and rehabilitate Vietnamese children while training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barsky Unit has built up a staff of eleven physicians and treated some 4,000 children . The task has not been easy . Many Vietnamese at first were suspicious of both the hospital and the foreigners-Americans , Canadians and British-who staffed it . The country 's chaotic transportation system also prevented many prospective patients from coming to the center ; to reach them , CMR1 set up ten screening clinics in the provinces . The procedure of picking patients is a delicate one . Says Dr. John Champlin , 32 , CMRl 's former screening officer : " It 's quite difficult to explain why you can help someone who 's missing half his face from noma , but ca n't help someone who 's paralyzed by polio . The medical distinction just is n't that clear to the people . " <P> Children selected for surgery are first admitted to a 120-bed reception center operated by the International Rescue Committee , where they spend weeks building up their strength for surgery . From there , they are moved to the 54-bed Barsky Unit for their operations . Doctors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar tissue that has immobilized joints , reconstructing faces ruined by shrapnel or napalm , and fitting maimed children with artificial limbs .
