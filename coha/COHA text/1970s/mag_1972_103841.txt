Key to the Mint is a mahogany bay half brother to the 1970 Horse of the Year , Fort Marcy , which of itself might make one think he could have Kentucky Derby prospects . But there were other , and better , indications late in his 2-year-old season . He won three of his final four races , finishing with a victory in the Remsen Stakes , a race that has been won by such fine horses as Jim French , Damascus and Northern Dancer . It also has been won by some duds , but let 's be optimistic . // Because he was larger than many colts his age . Key to the Mint was raced sparingly last year at two , just 10 starts . The hope was that as a 3-year-old he would develop his best form , in fact , just in time for the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May . // After the Remsen in late November , KTTM was unwound gradually . If a racehorse is stopped abruptly in his training , he loses condition , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So KTTM received shorter and shorter gallops . Through December he was given long daily walks . During this period he was vaccinated for VEE , as most states require this nowadays . For a while horsemen were alarmed by reports of the vaccine 's effects  --  it was said to cause brain damage  --  but actually the consequences appear mild . KTTM 's temperature rose slightly , to 101 ? from the normal 100 ? . The stable veterinarian prescribed rest  --  he said to do nothing but walk the colt for at least two weeks . // My horses  --  18 of them , all belonging to Paul Mellon  --  were flown to Miami on Dec. 17 and vanned to Hialeah . Racehorses travel first class . They had the plane to themselves , and the shipping bill ran close to $7,500 . Since I did not plan to run KTTM until the opening day of the Hialeah meeting , March 3 , he did little in the remaining weeks of December . It takes approximately two months to get a horse back into racing shape . // KTTM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other colts in the barn that could make it to the big race , too . They will appear in this diary from time to time as workmates of KTTM . So to introduce the cast of characters . Head of the River is a chestnut half brother to Run the Gantlet , the 1971 Turf Horse of the Year . He started only four times last season and like KTTM ended the year well . In his final race he was third to the 2-year-old champion , Riva Ridge . Straight To Paris is another lightly raced colt ; he started just twice in 1971 , winning his first race and placing third the next time . Finally , the last and least ( he is the smallest ) of the lot is Idle Answer , a son of Tom Rolfe and grandson of Bold Ruler . There is nothing puny about that breeding . // During January the colts worked slowly twice a week . On other days they were galloped leisurely a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half . Training thoroughbreds is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trial and error . But a trainer who has had classic horses in his barn before can base the training of his current crop on experience . I 've been lucky , winning three Belmont Stakes with Sword Dancer , Quadrangle and Arts and Letters . I 've been shut out so far in the Kentucky Derby  --  two seconds . This is the year to change that ! // Feb. 2  --  The campaign begins in earnest . KTTM had his first workout of the season in company ( with Head of the River ) . My exercise riders , Norman Kerr and Mike Kay , are both superb judges of pace . They know how fast their horses are going , which many famed jockeys do not , and can give reliable opinions about a colt 's performance . This morning KTTM , with Kerr up , seemed keen to compete . The time was satisfactory , three-eighths of a mile in 38 seconds . As a gauge for those unfamiliar with racing times , a horse running one furlong in 12 seconds is going at a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .24 , three in .36 , and so on . Both horses were sound after the work and ate their feed . KTTM loves his groceries . His daily diet is rather prosaic . He gets as much clover hay as he wants , which is usually half a bale , about 10 quarts of oats in three feedings ( 3:30 a.m. , 11 a.m. , 4 p.m. ) and a vitamin supplement . // Feb. 3  --  No excitement today , but KTTM was more eager galloping because of his breeze yesterday . He was very playful walking off the track , and I told John Veitch , my assistant , to have the colt 's groom , Sylvester Cook , walk out to the track and lead him home from now on . // Feb. 4  --  My first stop mornings is at KTTM 's stall . He seemed bright and his legs are cold and clean . Before he goes to the track each morning , at least three of us check him over . His groom has cared for nearly every one of my classic horses beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best prospects for Sylvester at the beginning of a season because he is so meticulous and , all right , I 'm superstitious . I figure he and I have something going for us . This morning Kristie Duckett , my exercise girl , galloped KTTM as Norman was busy elsewhere . The horse responds well to Kristie  --  she was his first rider as a 2-year-old  --  but I was a little leery lest he be too much of a handful for her . // Feb. 5  --  Routine . Ran into Lucien Laurin , the trainer of Riva Ridge . He seemed concerned that his horse was n't carrying enough flesh . Personally , I do n't believe Riva Ridge will ever carry much flesh , which would not bother me if he were in my barn . Skinny horses seem to last much longer than gross ones . What am I saying ! KTTM probably is 150 pounds heavier than Riva Ridge . // Feb. 6  --  Decided to send KTTM a slow mile . Had planned to work a mile on Feb. 2 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the River broke behind KTTM and almost caught him , going the mile in 1:473/5 . KTTM was clocked a second slower . The work was disappointing . I had wanted them to go in 1:46 . Norman says KTTM was too playful and did n't have his mind on his business . // Feb. 7  --  Went to our training farm 25 miles north of here in Davie as I had no horses breezing . KTTM 's 2-year-old half brother , who is called Key to the Kingdom ( no need to think small ) , is developing nicely . // Feb. 10  --  Decided KTTM was ready to step along with Head of the River . Told Mike and Norman to let them go half a mile in 50 or 51 seconds . Norman could n't hold KTTM so they went too fast  --  in .483/5 . I was upset but neither horse was in distress , so it obviously did n't harm them . I 'm going to have to alternate KTTM 's workmates or I 'll ruin Head of the River . It does neither horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11  --  KTTM has bumps on his body . I told John to put glauber salts in his water and get the vet to give him an antihistamine shot . Think he probably picked up chiggers from the straw . I remember bedding down a bunch of stalls myself once and getting bitten by them . It was agony . I hope this is not the start of skin disease , which horses are subject to in warm weather . It does n't bother them all that much , but they look Godawful for a while . Several years ago I ran a horse who had just gotten over it  --  call him my spotted wonder . He equaled the track record that day . Saw Riva Ridge gallop this morning . Laurin has added front bandages to his equipment . // Feb. 12  --  The skin condition appears to be getting better ; wonder if KTTM could have an allergy . Fort Marcy did  --  to straw  --  and we had to bed him on wood shavings. // Feb. 13  --  For the first time after a long rainy spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning we divide the horses into three sets to do their training . KTTM was put in the second set so that we could test the condition of the track with some of the other horses before getting him out . Norman breezed Straight To Paris a handy mile . He may yet give KTTM a tussle . Another of my 3-year-olds , Age of Gold , worked a slow six furlongs . I 've always liked this colt ; he is by far the best-looking horse in the barn , but he has n't looked that good on the track . Told Norman on KTTM to give Mike on Idle Answer the best of it when they broke the horses at the five-eighths pole . I meant Mike to have a two-or three-length head start , but he got away six or seven in front . KTTM caught up by the quarter pole ; they finished the work head and head though Norman was muzzling his colt at the end . Now both horses are ready for hard training . KTTM 's time was 1:002/5 . He 's looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season debut remains the Bahamas Stakes on March 3. // Feb. 16  --  KTTM is getting mighty perky and mean . He reared up in the walking ring and got his front leg over the shank , nearly pulling loose from Norman . It 's going to be difficult maintaining his schedule without a good race soon . Read in The Telegraph today that KTTM 's jockey , Braulio Baeza , is riding a Derby prospect for Ogden Phipps at Santa Anita today . Hope Baeza do n't decide to dump us for this colt . Jockey changes have cost me two and possibly three Kentucky Derbies . I lost the services of Bill Shoemaker twice , once because of injury and the other time when he rode another starter . In 1964 Bill Hartack opted for Northern Dancer instead of my colt , Quadrangle. // Feb. 17  --  Phipps ' horse ran out of the money ! Today I decided to find out if KTTM really was measuring up . I hooked him up with our swiftest colt , Straight To Paris . The latter had 10 pounds the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris got off six in front . KTTM just surged by with Norman standing up in the saddle for the last quarter of a mile . // Feb. 18  --  The wind came up during the night , making the horses frisky this morning ; the temperature has dropped 20 degrees . We made it through the day with no mishaps , but the boys had all they could do to keep their horses on the ground . Wind always has this peculiar effect on horses , really all animals . I 'm glad KTTM is working tomorrow ; maybe that will settle him down . // Feb. 20  --  The coldest morning of the winter , 40 ? , when I arrived at 6:25 a.m . Head of the River was KTTM 's victim . He managed to hold his own for seven-eighths of a mile . Head of the River made a bit of a noise while working . Hope he is n't developing wind problems . He 's done this before . A vet gave us some powder to put in his feed . This , plus taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to have solved the problem . Many overly large horses develop wind troubles but no one has ever explained why to my satisfaction . // Feb. 21  --  It 's still cold  --  45 ? to 50 ? . Straight To Paris coughed two or three times and KTTM once . I told Herbert Jackson , the stable foreman , to put a menthol salve in their noses and rub their throats with iodine salve . The stable vet tested Head of the River with a laryngoscope this afternoon . He tells me that the colt is not " touched " in the wind but does have a red spot on his soft palate . The vet recommends iodides in the colt 's feed plus an ounce of glycerine before he goes out in the morning . // Feb. 23  --  A busy but satisfactory morning , more than satisfactory . KTTM worked behind my star maiden , Age of Gold . The latter went five-eighths of a mile in 59 seconds while KTTM just breezed in 582/5 seconds . Norman did n't like the way KTTM was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . The colt had never taken a bad step in his racing career . I told Norman not to work the horse unless he was completely satisfied with the way KTTM moved around the track in his warmup gallop . After one turn Norman was reassured , and certainly the workout looked like all was in order . Head of the River had a workout that was the talk of the track  --  a mile by himself in 1:38 . Maybe he 'll be ready for the Flamingo Stakes . Straight To Paris got loose in the stable area . A sheet he was wearing while cooling out got tangled over an ear . He was caught unhurt . Plan to put new shoes on KTTM soon . I usually do this every three weeks , though some horses in the barn do n't grow enough foot in that time and are permitted to go four or five weeks between shoeings . KTTM wears three-ounce aluminum plates on each foot : a new set costs around $22 . The blacksmith 's art is unique . Trainers like myself make suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef . Most smiths feel it 's none of your business . // I am taking two days off to drive my family to Disney World in Orlando . I want to see the place , but a trainer should be with his horses . // Feb. 24  --  My wife and children enjoyed the whole scene , but I must admit that while I was voyaging to the bottom of a Disney sea my mind was on the horses . Talked to John at noon . KTTM has come out of his workout in good shape . Some of the horses were taken to the starting gate for schooling . We do this as part of the training regimen , especially early in the year so that the horses will remain calm on racing afternoons . As they stand in the gate you pet them and talk to them , maybe give them some sugar cubes until they quiet down . Straight To Paris was the only one to get upset today . The water dripped off him . Some colts become so disenchanted with the mechanical barrier that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse is useless for racing , which is the one reason we take so much care tutoring these young animals . // Feb. 25  --  Everything went smoothly in my absence . Maybe they do n't need me around as much as I think . All the 3-year-olds are eating well and their coats are glossy . One of the surest ways to check on a horse 's physical condition is to look in his feed tub after a meal . If it 's empty , he 's feeling fine . Another indication is the time it takes him to eat . There are slow eaters and fast eaters among horses just like there are among people , but if a horse pushes around his mash as if it were a cold , dried-up pork chop and has little enthusiasm for it , look for trouble . // Feb. 26  --  Planned to work KTTM with Farewell Party , my stakes-winning 4-year-old . But decided not to when he did n't walk properly . He was favoring his right front foot . I had him walk three or four rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding to pass up the work . He was not putting the hoof down plumb every time . He seemed rocky , instead of being sure of himself . Lameness can be a subtle thing . Is he sore or is n't he ? I told Tommy McNabo , our blacksmith , to shoe him with new plates and pay particular attention to the ailing foot . I also asked the foreman to put Azium powder , a muscle relaxant , in his feed for the next few days . And feeling that perhaps even that was n't enough , I told John Veitch to use our ultrasonic machine on the colt 's shoulders . McNabo may have found the trouble , a small bruise that he cut from the sole of the right front foot . It was probably caused by stepping on a stone . If all is well I will work him three-quarters of a mile tomorrow . // Feb. 27  --  The horse walked all right and his feet were cold to the touch . Every trainer in his daily examination of his horses runs his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or puffiness in the knees , ankles , tendons and feet . Worked KTTM behind Age of Gold . And again the big horse romped . Now I will work KTTM from the gate on Wednesday , and he 'll be ready to run on Friday in the Bahamas . // Feb. 28  --  The horse still walks wobbly when he comes out of the stall in the morning . I 've decided to paint the soles of his feet with an old-time remedy , pure pine tar and iodine . // Feb. 29  --  Each morning I am on edge when the horse takes his first few steps . He still does n't walk to suit me . Must decide tonight whether to work him from the barrier tomorrow . I remember once having a nice maiden filly here at Hialeah and having her fracture her pelvis working from the gate . Thinking of things like that tortures trainers . // March 1  --  Slept poorly . Awake on and off from 3:30 a.m . Finally got up at 5:15 . Dreaded going to the barn , feeling I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not perfect I would forget the workout and pass up the Bahamas . But KTTM passed his stem-to-stern check . I had put him in the final set of the morning . Went down to the clubhouse to watch him break along with Head of the River . Felt very jittery as I watched them walk in . They broke together , but it was no contest . KTTM was brilliant ; his fractions from the three-quarter pole were .103/5 , .213/5 , .332/5 Jumped the rail onto the track to walk home with the colts . Both were puffing but neither seemed distressed . Watched them cool out every step of the way , while answering questions of a couple of sportswriters . I did n't mention to them my concern earlier in the week . Now it is just 48 hours before the race . Have entered both KTTM and Head of the River . Straight To Paris runs in an allowance race . My wife and I played a bad but quick 18 holes of golf in time to return to the barn by 4:30 p.m . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // March 2  --  KTTM walking perfectly . He 's on edge , tried to nip me when I was showing him to a Louisville writer . This afternoon he will be schooled in the Hialeah paddock , a precaution to reacquaint him with racing surroundings so that he will not become excited while being saddled tomorrow . // March 3  --  Upper Case beat Spanish Riddle in the Florida Derby yesterday . Did not see the race but the time was not impressive ; they went the last eighth of a mile in just better than 14 seconds . Good 3-year-olds run quite a bit faster . // This page of my journal should be edged in black . Awoke at 4:15 a.m. and after tossing and turning finally got up . At the barn well before six . I was apprehensive about the afternoon as 1 ) KTTM has n't raced in three months ; 2 ) he has received the VEE shot since his last start , and several trainers claim their horses have lost form after receiving the injection ; 3 ) Baeza was so sick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never feel confident before a season debut . For that matter , I never feel confident before any race . // Met the boss at the airport and took him to the barn as the Bahamas was not until the ninth race . Run the Gantlet was fractious , shook up by the noise from the P.A. system that reverberates through the stable area . // The weather was not the best for racehorses  --  extremely hot and humid . Rain threatened . It never actually did rain , but I was sure it was going to pour at least three or four times . I did n't want to run KTTM on anything but a fast racing strip . // The afternoon was a disaster . Straight To Paris was a well-beaten fifth . I felt this was a very bad omen . Naturally , the colt had an excuse ( it 's rare when a horseman ca n't find one ) : another entry ridden by an inexperienced jockey crowded him into the rail . The evidence  --  white paint on his left flank  --  was right there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking ring before the Bahamas , KTTM and Head of the River captured most of the attention . Both behaved well and I was a bit proud of them . Received numerous compliments on their condition before the race but would rather have had the congratulations afterward . The stake was over almost before it began . New Prospect left the gate flying , and the others could n't get close . KTTM wound up a soundly beaten fourth , Head of the River sixth . Both horses came back hot and tired , but neither took a misstep as they cooled out . Thus they lived to fight again . // Today was my birthday . I should have expected disaster . // March 4  --  Arose earlier than usual , about 4:30 to check the horses at Hialeah before taking Mr. Mellon to Davie . KTTM had a swollen eye ( a clod must have hit him during the race ) . Left orders to bathe it with warm water and a weak boric acid solution and have the vet give him a Butazolidin injection . Bute has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Image scandal , but I think its controlled use a good , even necessary , thing . It took the inflammation out of KTTM 's eye in 24 hours . I 've been given Bute myself for ailments but it bothers my stomach . I ca n't tolerate it . I think the same thing may happen with horses , so I often give them an equine version of Pepto-Bismol along with the shot . // I raced two horses today , but most of my thoughts were on yesterday 's debacle . My conclusions are 1 ) I will have to put the blinkers back on KTTM to keep his mind on his business ; 2 ) will pass up the Flamingo  --  too soon after a hard , disappointing race ; 3 ) wo n't put much stock in the Bahamas as one of the horses that finished in front of KTTM was unable to get anywhere near him last year ; 4 ) the track condition was not the same as it has been for all the rest of the winter at Hialeah . Times were extremely fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had stood for several years . Why do n't track superintendents stop monkeying with the racing surface trying to set records and get big headlines ? They just break down our best horses ; 5 ) will probably run KTTM in the Hibiscus on March 22 . But I could start him before that if the racing secretary puts on an allowance race for which he is eligible . // March 5  --  I 'm worn out  --  nothing in the barn pleased me this morning . Nothing to complain about really , but on the other hand nothing to enthuse about either . When horses run well , even the worst animal in the barn has some appeal , but now the reverse is true . The weather remains hot and humid . More thunderstorms this afternoon , another off track for Monday . Trainers are like farmers  --  weather is a prime concern . I do n't like to run horses on a sloppy or muddy surface ; if something is going to happen to a horse it usually happens on an off track . // March 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the custom in my stable to give a horse who races two days walking after a start . At one time I gave them a day off , but they do even better with a couple of days rest . Also I usually have the vet give them a large dose of B-12 and iron two days after their races . This acts as a pick-me-up. // I put blinkers on Straight To Paris for the first time this morning as I think he held out on me in his race Friday . Blinkers keep a horse 's mind on his business , and while 2-year-old colts will give you all they can , horses when they become older often learn that they can get by with half or three-quarter efforts  --  the blinkers overcome this attitude . // March 7  --  The horse is beginning to look himself again . I thought he was peaked on Saturday and Sunday but in today 's gallop he wanted to run . Am not particularly keen on running him in the Hibiscus against Riva Ridge , but , if there is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1 , will have to run him . I do n't feel quite as bad about his fourth-place finish in the Bahamas now that I remember Arts and Letters finished third or fourth in his winter debut as a 3-year-old. // March 8  --  Am running my supermaiden , Age of Gold , tomorrow . He has trained superbly , and I 'll be disappointed if he does n't dazzle . Of course he may be just a morning glory , i.e. , a horse that breaks speed records in workouts but has no heart for races . Thankfully this sort of horse is n't too common . // March 9  --  KTTM will breeze in the morning as the racing secretary has scheduled an allowance race on Monday for which he is eligible . It is for non-winners of four races other than maiden or claiming , seven-eighths of a mile . // Age of Gold did n't win after all that advance billing . Finished second and refused to run up against the hail of dirt . I try all my horses one behind the other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up in the afternoon , perhaps because in a race there are more horses and more dirt . Most good animals  --  Arts and Letters and Fort Marcy , for example  --  just grittily forge ahead . // March 10  --  KTTM was brilliant . He and Head of the River were on the track by 6:30 a.m. , and , while I waited for them to breeze , I timed Riva Ridge three-quarters . Laurin had his jockey , Ron Turcotte , on the horse and we all caught him in 1:11 with Turcotte riding hard . Head of the River went five-eighths in .58 while KTTM , wearing blinkers , merely aired in .574/5 . Norman was annoyed that I held them up as they approached the finish as he wanted KTTM to run by Head of the River . This was just what I did n't want as I am still high on Head of the River and do n't want him discouraged . If we go to Kentucky we 'll take Head of the River and Straight To Paris along as workmates , with the off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Derby . // March 12  --  KTTM 's allowance race did n't draw enough entries ( only five ) so was canceled . But the racing secretary has put the same race back on Wednesday 's card , and there is also a six-furlong race that day which is wide open  --  by that I mean the conditions are so loose that even Riva Ridge is eligible ! // Went to Davie . KTTM 's half brother breezed behind two other colts . His action is becoming more fluid , which is encouraging . He seemed an ungainly oaf at the beginning . // Received disastrous news from Kentucky . Our foal by Arts and Letters out of Green Glade , a major stakes winner , died a few hours after arriving from Virginia . Indications are that the young colt had an abscess in his navel that went undetected , causing death . When he was foaled just three weeks before , I was told he was as fine a colt as had ever been born on the farm . Mr. Mellon took the news remarkably well . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KTTM on Wednesday will go with 12 entries . Will let the colt blow out tomorrow . Before a race  --  usually the day before  --  many horses are given sprints to clear their heads . Spent most of the day trying to locate Baeza 's agent , finally finding him in Maryland in the late afternoon . The jockey will fly in from California Tuesday night . // March 14  --  Sunny and beautiful , mainly because all the horses breezed according to plan . KTTM went three-eighths in .362/5 Was concerned lest he go too fast and leave tomorrow 's race on the track . I do n't like to work a horse the day before a race because it excites them too much , though it 's sometimes necessary . // March 15  --  It excites me , too . Arose half an hour early . Could n't sleep . Think the race could be tough as there are some sprinters entered that can really scat. // The race was a fiasco . KTTM appeared to be left at the post and trailed the whole field by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But he pulled up O.K. Another trainer yelled down the clubhouse at me that it was his right hind leg . I thought perhaps he had thrown his stifle out of joint leaving the gate . Ran to the track and followed him back to the barn . Noticed that he hesitated to put weight on his right hind leg and foot , indicating a stifle or foot injury . Sent one of the men after the vet , Dr. Joseph Burch ( no relation ) , and let John Veitch saddle Farewell Party for the Royal Palm Handicap while I watched KTTM cool out . He would take two or three normal steps , then try to rest the right hind leg . The stake was due to start and I had to leave . On my way back to the stand I met Baeza . He said KTTM had been uneasy in the gate and he had asked for an assistant starter to stand by the horse 's head , but the starter felt the horse was behaving all right . When the colt broke , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hit hard into another colt and nearly went down . // Farewell Party won ( at 18 to 1 ) . I accepted the trophy and hastened back to the barn . When I arrived , I found the men rubbing the colt dry with handfuls of straw as he was by now too sore to walk on the leg . One of Dr. Burch 's assistants showed up . He said he did n't think it was a bone injury , but the colt probably had received a deep bruise in the area around the patella . He gave KTTM a massive dose of Butazolidin and a tranquilizer . At 8:30 p.m. the horse was still in distress , so he received a stronger tranquilizer . None for the trainer . // March 16  --  Arrived at the barn about 5:45 a.m. expecting the worst . But the foreman reported KTTM much improved . His stifle and hock were swollen . Dr. Burch examined him  --  he called the injury a massive bruise , no broken bones and apparently no tendon involvement . The clot would gradually move down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse be kept in his stall for the next couple of days . // Time should take care of the injury , but now there is not enough time to do that and make it to Louisville , too . // March 24  --  The colt went to the track for the first time since his injury . We trotted him about a mile in a chute . He is bright and sassy and the filling has localized just above his foot . The healing is continuing at a rapid rate . I may even be able to run him by the first week in May . But not in the Kentucky Derby . // Now let 's say that Key to the Mint is my Belmont Stakes prospect . // April 1  --  Stop the presses ! Head of the River , substituting for KTTM , won the Everglades , beating Riva Ridge . The track was a bog , which is how HOTR likes it best . // Do you suppose it could rain good fortune , after all , at Churchill Downs on May 6 ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
