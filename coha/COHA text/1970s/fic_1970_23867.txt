thing infinitely more valuable : a great man . It hardly recognizes him , knowing as it does the ground from which he came , but lie is its finest issue . Behind Memorial Hall sits a cupola , white wooden dome over a brick foundation . For years it housed a replica of the Liberty Bell given to Independence by the town of Annecy le Vieux , France . Walking back from Wallace house , I discover that the cupola is empty , the bell gone , the bronze plaque rudely torn out of its brick moorings . I wonder where the hell has gone , ' as I wonder where the Watson Memorial Methodist Church has gone that no mark of its presence is left . On the square the courthouse is dilapidated , the windows dirty and spattered with paint , the sidewalk broken and faulted and bristling with aging parking meters .

Amen . 3 a story by Ivan Prashker SHIRT TALK w hen he heard his wife leave the apartment to go shopping in the afternoon , Moe Sohn , a retired shirt manufacturer in his late seventies , called his ex-partner , Sam Lipshitz , who 'd bought him out and was running the business alone . Moe had n't spoken to Lipshitz for more than a year ; they had n't gotten along when they were partners , and they 'd fought bitterly over price when the partnership broke up . Lipshitz , seventy years young but in good health save for slight prostate trouble , was surprised to hear from his ex- . " It 's been so long we spoke I almost do n't recognize you , " Lipshitz could n't resist . " Big deal , " Moe countered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm calling about business . " " What ' business ' a rich , retired stud like you has to worry about ? " Lipshitz needled . " Did you ship the goods to Kuflik ? " " Goods ? Kuflik ? " " I know he does n't pay so fast , but he 's proved to be a solid account over the years , su maybe you got to be a little lenient . " . Lipshitz looked like a boss , sitting in his Thirty-fourth Street office opposite the Empire State Building . An oily black cigar rested amiably between his fat lips and his feet were propped comfortably on his desk . Now whether or not he shipped goods to a customer was simply no longer Moe 's concern . Besides , six months ago , it became company policy to stop selling small-timers . All of which meant that Lipshitz did n't owe Kuflik beans , let alone shirts . " I 'm not following you , Moe , " Lipshitz said . " Maybe it 's because today I 'm thinking a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day . " Lipshitz gritted his teeth . Moe always could get under his skin . " Look , " he said impatiently , " l 'm a busy man , and I do n't quite get your train of thought , You 're out of business , what 's Kuflik got to do with you these days ? " " What do you mean I 'm out of business ? " Moe said indignantly . " I sold him six weeks ago for fall delivery . I want you to ship him even he does pay a little slow . " Lipshitz swung his feet off his desk . He put his cigar in the fancy copper ashtray on his desk , closed his eyes , and bit his lower lip . " Where 's your wife , Moishe ? " he asked . " Where 's Ida ? " " I know Kuflik from the old country yet , seventy years I know him , " Moe was saying . " How 's it look , he buys and we do n't ship cause he does n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to Ida , " Lipshitz said . " Ida 's downstairs shopping . What 's she got to do with shipping Kuflik ? This is shirts I 'm discussing . " " I 'll tell you , Moe , let me think about it . get back to you tomorrow about the Kuflik shipment . " But Lipshitz did n't wait until the following day to call back . He dialed Moe 's number when he was reasonably sure he would catch Ida in the apart-ment later that same afternoon . She was preparing dinner . " Ida , how 's Moe feeling ? " Lipshitz asked . " I 'll be right back , " she said , wiping her hands on her apron . She went into the living room . Moe was taking a nap , sprawled in his favorite chair . His mouth was wide open . Closing the kitchen door , Ida picked up the phone . " Why are you calling ? " she asked Lipshitz . " Did something happen today ? " " Is Moe acting ' funny ' lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good idea what Lipshitz meant . Not two days ago , looking Ida in the eye , Moe had asked , " Where 's my wife ? " " Please , " she said to Lipshitz , " why the questions ? " The ex-partner sighed . He hated to be the bearer of had news but felt obliged to tell Ida she had to keep her husband from calling the office . Between the time Lipshitz had spoken to Moe and dialed Ida , he 'd learned that for the last two weeks Moe had been discussing nonexistent business with office personnel  --  the bookkeeper , two salesmen , an inside man , even the mailroom boy . And they 'd all been afraid to tell him about Moe 's calls , but once Lipshitz had broken the ice that afternoon , every other gossip with a contribution to make eagerly chimed in . And Lipshitz , who half enjoyed working himself up over shaky office morale , had decided to put a stop to the older man 's foolishness before it got out of hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ida , " was how he began . She listened patiently , as Lipshitz spelled out the telephone calls Moe had made to the office the past two weeks . Ida was not surprised . Moe had lived for his work . After his second heart attack a year and a half ago , she 'd forced him to retire . It was a wifely duty she had had to perform for his own good . But sitting home with time on his hands after a lifetime of hard work , Moe suffered misery Ida became aware only even existed this last year ; and now she hated herself for having laid down the retirement law to her husband . You know , " she told Lipshitz , " I 'm sorry I did n't send him hack to the office with my blessing after the second heart attack . It would have been better for him to die on Thirty-fourth Street than be unhappy for a year counting the money other shirt people were raking in . " " But that 's crazy talk , " Lipshitz cut her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office gave his ex-partner goose pimples . " About why I dialed you , Ida . dear , " he said , bringing the conversation hack to essentials . " Moe 's calls got to stop . " Ida had an inspiration . " Is it really so terrible he telephones , talks business to you or someone else in the office once in a while ? " she asked . Somehow the question struck like a blade to the belly . Lipshitz squirmed . " Ida . I 'm a manufacturer , not a psychiatrist . " " I know it 's a big favor to ask , but could n't you kid him along ? Talk business to him as if he were still a partner ? " Lipshitz had always liked Ida and wished he could grant her request . Screw office morale ! You pay your people good money , that 's office morale . But Lipshitz could n't forget that after selling to him . Moe had spread the word in the industry he 'd been taken for a one-way ride by his former partner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go along with what you 're asking . I really do , " Lipshitz said . " But in the first place , I 'm a busy man . Since Moe is n't here , I do two jobs . And in the second place , it 's hard to forget Moe told everyone I took advantage he was sick and only offered a lousy price . I mean , my heart just is n't in the right place for him these days . " " What he said about you is nothing to what he says about me because I made him retire , " Ida answered . " He ca n't work , and it 's killing him , so he leaves it out . But if he could talk shirts to you , it might make it easier for him at home . He 's got no friends . All his brothers and sisters are dead . Talk business to him . Do it . And if you ca n't do it for him , then do it for me . " Once , when everyone was younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed money quickly . He was ashamed to ask Moe , a Sabbath observer , and in desperation turned to Ida . She gave him cold cash the following day , telling him explanations between friends were unnecessary . And now . twenty years later , she was asking this favor of him , and though Lipshitz hated getting involved he found he could n't say no . " All right , Ida . " he told her . " But remember , this is only for your sake . " M oe was still dozing when his wife went hack into the living room . He looked shrunken . She knew he could n't have weighed more than one hundred and ten pounds . Sometimes at night she would watch him put on his pajamas , and seeing he was all bone it was difficult for her to keep herself from gasping . He was almost seventy-nine years old . and she knew she was lucky he 'd lived this long . and in relative good health . But still , he was her hus ? band , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want him to die . Because he 'd been having trouble sleeping during the nights the last two weeks , Ida gave him a sleeping pill that evening . The pill did n't do much good , however , for sometime after one o'clock she heard him getting out of bed . She thought he was going to the bathroom and said nothing . The next thing she knew she heard him opening the front door . She jumped out of bed . " Moe , what 's the matter ? " she exclaimed , But he did n't answer her . Snapping on the hall light , she said , " Moe. where are you going ? " He was standing near the front door , wearing only his pajamas , which no longer fit him . " I was looking for the paper , " he said . A delivery boy dropped the New York Times opposite their apartment door each morning between seven and seven-thirty.
