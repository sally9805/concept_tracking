Go ! That 's what his followers say , and Teddy seems to agree <P> He has not said so yet , but he is about the only one who has not . And his supporters are fairly screaming it . As far as they are concerned , Senator Edward M. Kennedy has entered the race for the presidency , and they are working for him with that special kind of zeal that has not been seen since the days of his two older brothers . Ideology does not seem to count , as Democrats of all persuasions - and many independents too-are urging on the man who they think could restore leadership to an ineffectual White House . Draft-Kennedy movements are springing up everywhere , some of them led by former Carter supporters , and Kennedy 's own elated staff members are beginning to jockey for positions in the would-be , might-be , soon-to-be campaign . Says an enthusiastic aide to California Senator Alan Cran- ston , the Senate whip and a top member of the Democratic establishment : " Everybody in California is just sitting and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Auto Workers and the Beverly Hills crowd . What else is there ? " <P> Even President Carter had to admit last week that Kennedy 's strategy at the moment is " brilliant . " While building support with broad hints that he is available to run , the Senator has so far refrained from openly challenging the President and thus risking a bloody party brawl . He would prefer to see Carter pushed out of the race by pressure from the party and the dismal evidence of the polls . Late last week the President was hit with the most staggering poll news to date : an Associated Press-NBC News survey indicated that only 19% of the Americans polled thought Carter was doing an excellent or good job . That was the lowest approval rating for any President since such polls began in the 1930s - including Richard Nixon 's 24% just before his resignation . <P> The Kennedy momentum has been soaring for the past fortnight as the Senator has sent out a series of unmistakable signals . First he dropped the remark that his mother Rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race , not a startling revelation since the Senator is the head of his clan . But family considerations have been a major hindrance to his running for President . Next came a lunch with Carter and Rosalynn at the White House . " I am seriously considering entering the race , " Kennedy told the President . Replied Carter : " I am definitely planning to run . " Later Carter said to his advisers : " Kennedy understands that if he comes in , he will have a fight on his hands . " <P> <P> The Senator moved still closer to an announcement when he found himself holding an impromptu press conference at a Kennedy Center benefit . He indicated that he would be willing to run even if it meant a primary fight , and he pledged to decide before the primary deadlines ( the first is Jan. 11 ) . Said Kennedy : " I 've always believed in the primary system . I think it would be a hard-fought battle , both the nomination and the election . I think this will be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
