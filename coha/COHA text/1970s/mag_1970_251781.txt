This winter , commuting to Manhattan and Philadelphia has turned from a burden into a nightmare . Almost every working day , thousands of passengers shiver in the unheated and unlighted cars of stalled trains , while others wait on windy platforms for trains that never arrive or are from 30 minutes to three hours late . The crisis has produced protest meetings and a threat by the New York Public Service Commission to file suit against the Penn Central Railroad for inept performance . It has also cost businesses millions of dollars in lost man-hours and added to the general malaise of city life . <P> Stuart T. Saunders , chairman of Penn Central , which runs most of the commuter lines into Manhattan and Philadelphia and more than one-third of all the passenger trains in the U.S. , offers no hope of improvement without Government help . " To reverse the deterioration of passenger service , " he says , " we must have substantial assistance . " <P> Real Estate Riches . Last week the Department of Transportation proposed a Comsat-type public corporation called Railpax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is considerable doubt whether the Administration will endorse the Government subsidies that Railpax needs . <P> Penn Central executives contend that their line lost $73 million on passengers in the first nine months of 1969 . The company will show an estimated $30 million in consolidated profit for the year , largely from its rich real estate operations ; earnings will be down from $90 million in 1968 . The Penn Central 's $6.5 billion assets include four Manhattan hotels and a 24% interest in Madison Square Garden , real estate in Florida , Texas , California and Georgia , and a 7,600-mile oil pipeline system . Such holdings make many angry travelers skeptical about Saunders ' protestation of poverty . Many are convinced that this winter 's scandalous service is a deliberate attempt to drive them away and have the Government take over the business . Penn Central executives deny any plan to downgrade service , but in 1968 the company spent $14.2 million less on passenger service maintenance than four years earlier . <P> Merger Confusion . The railway men have no shortage of excuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset by profits from freight . But the freight business was hit hard by the merger two years ago between the Pennsylvania and the New York Central . The two railroads had separate freight yards in many cities , and in the post-merger confusion thousands of cars went to the wrong yards , causing costly tangles . The merger was also accompanied by the abrasive sound of personalities grating on each other ; the scramble for a declining number of management jobs is not yet over . Since the tie-up , about 700 surplus executives have retired . <P> The costs of the merger were wildly miscalculated , and Penn Central is still trying to devise a computer-based information system to keep managers up-to-date on all of its activities . It also suffers from an archaic labor contract , under which an engineer is paid for a day 's work for every 100 miles that he travels ; if he rides the high-speed Metroliner , for example , he gets 41 days ' pay ( $111 ) for each round trip from Washington to New York . The railroad chiefs complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger cars .
