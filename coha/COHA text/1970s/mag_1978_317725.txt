To make a statement about waste in U.S. society , Economist David Osterberg , 35 , of Cornell College in Mount Vernon , Iowa , moved into a chicken coop nearly two years ago . The quarters are small ( 9 ft. by 12 ft. ) but cheap : $40 a month for rent and electricity . Osterberg installed a glass skylight , insulation and not-so-spartan furnishings , including a stereo , color television , refrigerator , telephone , toaster oven and several Persian rugs . Says he : " Living this way makes me feel that at least I 'm not part of the problem . " <P> Now the county health board is trying to evict Osterberg from his home , maintaining that the coop is too small and too primitive for human habitation because it has no toilet or running water . Says County Health Director Alfred Ahern : " You ca n't live like Pappy did on the frontier . " But Osterberg argues that the absence of running water is no health threat because he uses the bathroom of a college building five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coop , and is appealing the eviction order in court .
