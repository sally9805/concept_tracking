txt The Supreme Court ruled today , on a 5-to-3 . vote , that young men who do not register with their draft boards at age 18 can not be prosecuted after five years have lapsed . The Justices held that the crime of failing to register occurs when , a youth reaches the age of 18 ' and does not report to his draft board within the five-day period specified by a Federal regulation . At that point the general five-year statute of limitations for noncapital Federal crimes begins to run , the Court . said . Therefore , if charges are not brought within the next five years , the unregistered youth will become immune from prosecution at the age of 23 years plus six days . This brought protests- from the three dissenting Justices that the- decision ' frees law violators from their obligation to register and from liability for not doing so at the age of 23 , while those who register . can be drafted until they reach age 26 . Age 31 Limit Argued The dissenters asserted that young men who fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft obligation ends at age leaving them subject to indictment until the fiveyear period of limitations expires at age 31 . Government lawyers said today that the ruling would probably not have a. sharp impact on the operation of the Selective Service System because the vast majority of young men register when they turn 18 . But lawyers speculated that it might encourage nonregistration by 18-year-olds . If the nonregistrants last five years without detection and indictment , they now become immune from prosecution and perhaps from induction as well . If they are caught , the Government will most likely drop criminal . prosecutions if they agree to go into the service . However , Government attorneys pointed out several potential developments that could blunt the impact of today 's ruling . Congress could react by amending the law to make it clear that the statute of limitations does not start to run until a person reaches ' the age of 26 and is no longer liable to induction . Also , the President could issue an order requiring annual registration by young men , so that each failure would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year prosecution period. ? Moreover , spokesmen for the Selective Service System pointed out today that a Federal statute stops the running of the statute of limitations with respect to any young man who goes to Canada or any other foreign country for the purpose of " fleeing from justice . " While it is not clear that this would apply to young men who might choose to skip draft registratron and spend the next five years in Canada , it would probably discourage large numbers of them from doing so . Today 's decision grew out of the , Government 's prosecution of Robert I. Toussie , a 28-yearold entrepreneur from Brooklyn who amassed about $1-million in the children 's clothing industry by - the age of 24 . Mr. Toussie , a descendant of Syrian Jews who was reared as a pacifist , did not register for the draft when he turned 18 June , 1959 . , The matter did not come to thee ; Government 's attention - until an informer alerted them in 1967 . ? Mr. Toussie was indicted and convicted for failing to register . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register is a continuing offense that is repeated each day of non-registration , The maximum . penalty is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine , but Mr. Toussie 's sentencing was delayed , pending his appeal . Today the Supreme Court , in an opinion . by Justice Hugo L. Black , threw out the conviction and accepted Mr. Toussie's- contention that his indictment was void because it came more than five years after he committed the offense . Justice Black explained that the statute of limitations existed to discourage laggard prosecutions by the Government and to spare defendants the hazards of defending themselves after the evidence had grown cold . Chief Justice Dissents Because the Court agreed that Mr. Toussie 's offense occurred on the fifth day after his- 18th birthday and his obligation to register then ended , it did not have to face a more troublesome question raised by him- that a continuing obligation to register later would constitute compulsory self-incrimination , since to register later - would --  be an admission that he had not:registered when he turned 18 . The Majority opinion was joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thurgood Marshall and Potter Stewart . Justice Byron R. White wrote the dissent . He was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice John M. Harlan . They pointed out that Mr. Toussie admitted he had intentionally omitted registering . However , the dissent said , as a result of today 's decision , " while all around him , young men were being inducted , 26-year-olds first , petitioner at 18 years and 6 days is forever free of any duty  --  and at 23 is forever free from prosecution for his initial failure  --  to place himself , like them , ? into the pool from which inductees are selected . " Young men who fail to ap- ? pear for induction are not affected by the decision . Nobody has questioned that the fiveyear period of limitations begins to run when they fail , to appear . Murray I. Gurfein of . New York argued for Mr. Toussie . Francis X. Beytagh of the Solicitor General 's office argued for the Government .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
