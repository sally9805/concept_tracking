One index of how financially pressed Americans feel is the popularity of grocery coupons , those little pieces of paper snipped from product labels or newspaper ads that housewives have long used to save nickels and dimes at the check-out counter . By the Agriculture Department 's reckoning , coupons are used at least occasionally in 80% of American households , up from 58% in 1971 . Nonetheless , only one coupon in ten is ever redeemed at a store , and there is at least one determined bargain hunter who believes that consumers do not realize the full potential of these freebies . She is Susan Samtur , 34 , a mother of two and former school teacher in Yonkers , N.Y. , who has published her ideas on how to be a supershopper in a new book called Cashing In at the Checkout . <P> Samtur says that by making the most of coupons she is able to snip 40% to 60% off her food bill every time she shops , for an average savings of $40 or more a week . Moreover , she claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers promise cash rebates to consumers for trying their products , she reaps an additional $1,500 annually . <P> Stores like coupons , which can be offered for any item but are most commonly used to promote cleaning aids , health and beauty products , and processed foods . After a coupon is redeemed by a customer , the manufacturer of the product pays the store not only the coupon 's face value , usually 5 or 10 , but also a handling fee that may be as high as 5 and is mostly profit for the store . Most shoppers would probably find the supershopping routine very exhausting . Samtur spends five hours a week clipping coupons , filing cents-off labels and mailing out refund requests , which average 100 a month . She tears labels while watching TV ; when she takes her children to the doctor , she cuts coupons from the magazines in the waiting room . <P> Samtur buys only nationally advertised brands , since they are the only ones that offer coupons and rebates , buys in bulk and seeks out bargains . Example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an introductory price of 89 , she laid in 20 tubes . She paid only 79 for ten of the tubes , because she was able to use ten 10 Crest coupons that she had filed away . When the price rose to the regular $1.49 a tube a week later , she had saved $13 . <P> Samtur insists that she never buys something she will not use just to get a coupon or a rebate . Says she : " That would defeat the whole purpose of the system , which is to save money . " She takes pride in the fact that when her son goes to the beach , he is outfitted with slippers , beach bag , towel and hat , all free from the makers of Glad bags , a T shirt from Campbell Soup , a Raggedy Andy toy from Crest and a wagon from Viva paper towels . Only his bathing suit was paid for , and it , of course , was on sale .                 @ @ @ @
