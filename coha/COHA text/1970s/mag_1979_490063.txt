THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A YOUNG woman we know writes : This morning , I was listen  --  ing to the radio  --  I mean , I was iron  --  ing my shirt and the radio was on  --  and the disc jockey said that the Beatles were getting hack together , that they were going to give a benefit concert for some important cause or other , and how great that would be . He said , " Can you imagine the Beatles back and play  --  ing together ? " I imagined that , and while I was at it I imagined a number of other things . I imagined that I was in love with the man who discovered the principle of hydrogen bonding and that he was in love with me , too , and that it was all almost wonderful ; I imagined that my favorite color was red and that my favorite words were " vivid , " " astonishing , " " enigmatic , " " ennui , " and " ululating ; " I imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I imagined that all the people I did n't like were gathered up in one big barrel and rolled down from a high mountain into a deep , deep part of the sea ; I imagined that all the hooks on my shelf had long legs and wore flesh-colored panty hose and that their long legs in the flesh-colored panty hose dangled from the book  --  shelf ; I imagined that the trains in the subway had all the comforts of a private DC-9 ; I imagined that I had the most beautiful face in the whole world and that some men would faint after they got a good , close look at it ; I imagined that I had different-colored underwear for every day of the year ; I imagined that it was a real pleasure to be with me , because I was so much fun and always knew the right thing to say when the right thing needed to be said ; I imagined that I knew by heart all the poems of William Words  --  worth ; I imagined that it rained only at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the rain would lull me to sleep , and that it stopped raining just before I woke up every morning ; I imagined that I could run my tongue across the win  --  dowpane and not pick up , perhaps , some deadly germ ; I imagined that all the people in the world were colored and that they all liked it a whole lot , because they could wear outlandishly styled clothes in outlandish colors and not feel ridiculous ; and then I again imagined the Beatles back and play  --  ing together . None of it did a thing for rne , ? ? Upside Relief EEKDAY mornings , a Iot of people who own radio-alarm clocks awaken at the sound of Larry Wachtel 's voice . It is a good-humored voice but not a lullaby voice . It sounds more like several taxis stuck in tunnel traffic . It sounds the way Larry Wachtel looks  --  late forties , dark hair , medium height , stocky build , plenty of smiles . Larry Wachtel broadcasts stock market commentary on WINS , the all-news-all-the-time radio station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened and their elocution polished so you can doze right through their accounts of apart ment-house blazes and after-hours-club stickups and hockey results , until 7:27 A.M. At that moment , Wachtel , speak ing very quickly in a native Brook lynese  --  a Brooklynese so resilient it has withstood three years ' exposure to life in Yonkers and , before that , six  --  teen years ' exposure to life in the Bronx , not to mention nineteen work ing years on Wall Street offers one minute and forty-five seconds of fact and opinion about the day ahead in the business world in general and the stock market in particular . Wachtel , who is a first vice-president in the research department of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields , Inc. , a brokerage firm , writes all his own material . To accomplish this , he has to wake up awfully early . The least that someone still lying there in bed can do is pay attention . This re  --  quires no real effort , because Wachtel is addicted to ear-opening phraseology . He does not hesitate to sound esoteric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he says that " the broad list is severely oversold and is in the frame  --  work that normally would allow some upside relief . " He waxes inspirational : " We now have the possibility of an orthodox one-third to one-half retrace  --  ment of the prior one-hundred-point decline , so today let 's think follow-through , let 's think volume . " He stands fearless in the face of the cliche and the mixed metaphor : " When a lot of finance ministers sit around and send ideas up the flagpole , you never know what can develop , " and " I be  --  lieve the market has been put to the test and while the jury is still out I feel the prognosis is favorable . " Tie anthropomorphizes : " I am hopeful that the market will begin to look beyond the short-term pain of higher interest rates to the long-term pleasure of combatting inflation . " He loves the stock market . Occasionally , Wachtel is cryptic . The other day , for instance , he came up with the following : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area of primary support . We expect the blue-chip index to build its tedious picket fence within that range over the next several NOVEMDER . I 99 19 7 9 weeks . " What he meant by this , ap  --  parently , was that he hoped the Dow-Jones Industrials average would not fall below 790 . " Every now and then , you 've got to reach for them , " he told us , in an apologetic tone , when we asked about the picket fence . " My ap  --  proach has always been that I 'm talk  --  ing to a professional audience  --  real market watchers . I assume that they know what I mean . Maybe I overdo it . " On this particular day  --  which hap  --  pened to be the fiftieth anniversary of Black Tuesday , the climax of the 1929 stock-market collapse  --  we ob  --  served Wachtel doing his early chores . At a quarter to six , a black limousine , driven by a man known as Al , arrived at Wachtel 's home in Yonkers for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , he read fresh copies of the Times and the Wall Street Journal that had been waiting for him in the back seat . Because it was a Monday , he had brought along sec  --  tions of the weekend newspapers and the latest issue of Barron 's , and he read them as well . A few years ago , before the limousine became a fixture in Wachtel 's life , he rode the subway to the financial district , often encounter  --  ing delays that forced him to phone the radio station and do his broadcast from the I.R.T. , winging it without a type ? written script . Now , however , there was no bothersome traffic , and the limousine ride took only a half hour . It was such a swift trip that when Wachtel arrived at his office , near City Hall , he had not finished honing his metaphors . Nevertheless , he had a good idea of what he planned to say . " I 'm going with the Great Crash this morning , " he said as he rode the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign-currency markets in the institutional-trading department . " You ca n't avoid talking about the Crash . Last week , I was on the road a few days in Virginia  --  Norfolk , Hamp  --  ton . Everybody asked me , ' Is there go  --  ing to be another Crash ? ' Today , I think I 'll start off with ' Yes , Virginia , your little friends are correct . Fifty years ago today , Wall Street laid a great big egg . ' Then I 'll tell them that it ca n't happen again . " When Wachtel had the foreign-currency quotations in hand  --  the dol  --  lar was holding up well against the British pound , the Swiss franc , the Deutsche mark , and the yen  --  he led us to his office , on the third Poor . In  --  side , electronic ticker screens from the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange occupied one wall . They were illuminated but quiet , each bearing a stationary print out , " EZEZEZ EZEZ EZEZEZEZEZEZ , " as if the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , looked as if it had al  --  ready survived a full working day . Wachtel glanced around the room  --  at yellowed stacks of Wall Street Journals on the floor , cabinets stuffed and overflowing with fi  --  nancial periodicals , wire copy spilling off desks  --  and said , " I know . I 've got to clean this place up . We 're having some visiting firemen coming in any minute . But I 'm a big paper-saver . Now work . " orhka2 , ve to get to He removed the jacket of his suit -- a three-piece blue houndstooth check  --  and hung it over the back of his chair , spread out newspapers on his desk , sat down at his typewriter , and got to work . Twenty minutes later , he yanked a sheet of paper out of the machine and announced , " I 'm all done . " He invited us to inspect the re  --  sults . The script led off , as he had promised , with the Great Crash , and averred , " There ai n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beleaguered bond mar  --  ket , " something called " the Blue Mon  --  day syndrome , " " international uncer  --  tainty in the wake of the violence in South Korea , " " the key Saudi bench  --  mark grade , " " factory orders , con  --  struction spending , and the leading eco  --  nomic indicators , " and the blue-chip index 's " tedious picket fence , " and , at the end , stated , " It 's a time for regain  --  ing composure and deflecting disaster . Selectivity will continue to hold sway . " When we handed the script back , he stepped into another office , phoned an engineer at WINS , cleared his throat twice , said , " Testing one two three four four three two one , " read the en  --  tire script in one take , hung up , and returned to his office with ten minutes to spare before turning on his transistor radio to hear a playback . " It always kills me to listen to my  --  self on the radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think. , That ca n't be me ? . / sound like Ronald Colman . I get calls saying ' You need speech lessons . ' I get other calls saying ' I love your voice ; you 're a New York guy . ' I get THE NEW YORKER calls saying ' What stocks do you like ? ' and ' What stocks do you really like ? ' " He hunched his shoulders and then arched his hack , like someone who has just risen from a nap . " I 'm glad to be back in the office today . Because I was on the road part of last week , I kind of lost my feel for the market . I need to  --  day to get it back . But I have to travel a lot . I give speeches and pep talks at our branch offices . I ca n't help it . I 'm in demand This afternoon , I 'm giving a little presentation up at the Lord &; Taylor store in White Plains . You know , they do Chinese cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the stock market . " Film AWOMAN had the eminent in- ternational journalist Lowell Thomas on the ropes at a low-proof ( white wine , Coke , Fresca ) cocktail party in the Schermerhorn Room of the Union Club while people waited for the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , to arrive and receive a film , made in Tibet in 1942 and 1943 by two members of the Office of Strate  --  gic Services , that the Veterans of the O.S.S. wanted to give the holy man as a gesture of friendship on his first visit to America . " As a newscaster , you vis  --  ited Tibet , did n't you ? " the woman was saying . " Well , when they show the film , you 'll be one of the few people in the room who will know what Tibet actually looks like . You visited China , too , did n't you ? Which did you like better  --  China or Tibet ? Did you find there was freedom of speech in China ? Were you able to say what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self ? I bet China was fascinating ? " Then , suddenly , a round photographer standing near the door hopped to , and the TV cameramen turned on their lights , and Lowell Thomas head  --  ed toward the door , and the people in the room came to attention in a rank , and in walked Tenzin Gyatso , His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama , who has been recognized as the reincarnation of his predecessor , the Thirteenth Dalai Lama , since he was two years old in the small village of Taktser , in northeastern Tibet , who is called yeshe norbu ( " the wish-ful  --  filling gem " ) and kundun ( " the pres  --  ence " ) by the Tibetan people , and who has been living in exile since the Chinese crushed a rebellion in Ti  --  bet in 1959 . As he carne through the door , he was giving someone an auto  --  graph . Lowell Thomas brought along a man in a brown suit from the crowd . " Your Holiness , I would like to pre  --  sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dalai Lama sat down and watched the film , which was made for strategic purposes by Captain Brooke Dolan , of the O.S.S. Colonel Ilia Tolstoy , grandson of the writer , was the other O.S.S. officer on the Tibetan trek . " Tibet is a land of mystery and mysticism . " Shot of mountains , clouds . " Religion is the dominant influence that controls the people of this vast /and .... The very existence of the Ti  --  betan depends upon the yak . " Shot of yaks . " Tibetans are inherently socia  --  ble . " Shot of smiling Tibetans . " They have a happy disposition and make friends quickly .... Nature presented Tibet with the ideal focal point for Buddhism . " Shot of face of Dalai Lama , aged eight . End . The lights came on , and the Dalai Lama stood up . His head was shaved so that it looked as if his hair had been drawn on his head . He was wearing rectangular metal-rimmed glasses . His red robes reached below his knees . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in Tibetan . " Thank you very much . It was an ex  --  cellent film , " his interpreter said . The Dalai Lama then threw back his robe , looked at a gold watch on his left wrist , and said something else in Tibetan .

He was framed , the table was framed , the hors d'oeuvres were framed by roses . The young man said to a man be  --  hind the table , " Listen , nobody can take the flowers . " The man behind the table , a short man with curly gray hair , said , " I ca n't stop them . " The young man with dark hair said , " No . No . When they do it , you say ' No . ' They ca n't pull them out . They ca n't pull out the flowers . " The young man with dark hair left . The shorter man looked up at the flowers : masses of small rosebuds . He served some food . He wore white gloves that were just slightly soiled . " They pull them out . How can I stop them P " he asked us . This is the future .

She was in tour sales , she said . We asked if she knew who had de  --  signed the pillars . " I 'm sorry , I do n't , " she said . " I asked you if there was anything you wanted to know , and now I probably wo n't be able to tell you anything you want to know . " This young woman then turned to someone else . A gray-haired woman carrying sev  --  eral roses came up and looked straight at us and then went away , saying a few words to herself . A young man standing next to a pile of crab hors d'oeuvres ate one crab hors d'oeuvre after another . Then he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not taking roses , " he said . " Some of those ladies have ten , twenty roses . " The young man had a voice that was soft but highly inflected . Another young man had cameras hanging from his shoulders . He was talking to a man and a woman . The woman was interested in what he was saying . The man was n't . It seemed that the young man with the cameras had thought up the name of a Broad  --  way show . " Then it was an idea . Now it 's a play , " he said . The man turned away from him to talk to someone else . " They never gave me credit . They never gave me a credit line , " the young man said to the woman . The woman tapped the man who had turned away , and brought him around . " They never gave him credit , dear , " she said . The young man said , " Yeah , the end of the story is they never gave me credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a polo motif at the New York Hilton , representatives of the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club  --  a new Polo and Country Club , a Polo and Country Club of this mo  --  ment ( situated on sixteen hundred and fifty acres ; offering a splendid array of sports facilities , including the world 's most complete polo center and an equestrian complex ; complemented by a choice of villas , cottages , and lux  --  urious manors , distinctive residences that offer exceptional value in a setting of aristocratic excellence ) ? met with others interested in the motif of polo and in elaborations of the motif of polo . At Hurlingham 's , the polo motif was carried out in a restrained breakfront filled with books ( Hervey Allen , the novels of Frank Stockton , Reader 's Digest Condensed Books ) , in re  --  strained brass light fixtures , in red carpet squares with green leaves and little yellow polo players on them , and in reproductions of paintings by Gains-borough and Reynolds representing the ties of sport to the vanished world of eighteenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectern , a large painting of a polo player  --  a painting done in the style of paintings done on television through the agency of a computer . Some people in the room were in formal clothes , because it was the eve  --  ning of the opening of the Horse Show and some people were going to the Horse Show , where there was to he an exhibition of polo ( sponsored by the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club ) , which , according to representatives of the Polo and Country Club , would he the first polo played in Manhattan in fifteen years . It was the opinion of many people in the room that polo was " go  --  ing to happen . " It was n't just repre  --  sentatives of the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club who said this . Other people said it . They said that polo was going to happen . Jerzy Kosinski , who has written a book with a polo motif , was there ( in formal dress ) , and he was of the opinion that polo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the fact that polo had n't happened before . " It 's an ultimately American event , " he said . " Horses and men . Cowboys . The collision of two teams . Why would n't it make it ? I have a theory . It is the film lens . The film lens ca n't cover the field . The saying in polo is that the action is always on the other side of the field . The field is ten times the size of a football field . The lens ca n't cover the field . " Mr. William Ylvisaker , chairman of the board of Gould , Inc. , which is the parent organization of the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club , spoke . He stood in back of the lectern , in front of the large painting of the polo play  --  er . He mentioned the sponsored polo events that are scheduled to occur at the Polo and Country Club , Rolex , the world 's leader in fine timepieces , will sponsor the Rolex Gold Cup ; Cartier , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor the Cartier International Open ; and Michelob will sponsor the Michelob World Cup . Gucci and Paine Webber will sponsor tournament days , he said . " It is indicative that if we get these sponsors we will get publicity , " he said . THE PAST : The St. Regis-Sheraton has put up a display in the east end of its lobby . There are pictures of events and people associated with the St. Regis , assembled on big Si ! ? vet-colored cardboard panels standing something over seven feet tall . These panels zigzag through the east end of the lobby in the way associated with school exhibits . The Story of Milk . The Oregon Trail . These Indian Artifacts Collected by a Local Resi  --  dent . The photographs are good , how  --  ever . There are good pictures of Fifth Avenue , showing the Gotham and the St. Regis as the tallest buildings on the avenue ; good pictures of the interior as it was furnished when the hotel opened , in 1904 . There is considerable space given to ramifications of the Astor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to be helpful and are helpful . Ingenuous , too , in a way . Pleasing adjectives are sought for ev  --  eryone . Fernand Petiot , whom Vin  --  cent Astor imported from Harry 's New York Bar in Paris , is described as a " popular bartender . " Ava Astor 's second husband is called a " well-known English lord , " and then his title is misspelled . A section on the nine  --  teen-fifties is angled in toward the wall , nearly intersecting an ormolu standing clock . in this part of the dis  --  play , the silver cardboard panels are linked one to another by small silver-colored plastic hinges . From top to bot  --  tom on the edge near the ormolu clock are pictures of Ernest and Mary Hem  --  ingway ( he was the popular novelist ) , Mr. Pctiot , the popular bartender , and then a more purely social group , includ  --  ing Elsa Maxwell , Winston Guest , Jean Howard , Fulton Cutting III , and Mrs. Winston Guest . The picture is unbecoming to Miss Maxwell -- espe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is be  --  coming , in a way , to Mrs. Guest , who looks bored in a manner that would be interesting to someone glancing in her direction . Mayor ONE day recently , at about half past twelve , some people with disparate professional interests gathered at the site of the first City Hall in New York City , on Pearl Street  --  now a vacant lot  --  and waited for Mayor Koch , the city 's Landmarks Preser  --  vation Commissioner , and an archeol  --  ogist to say a few words about archeol  --  ogy , Old New York , immigrants , the Dutch , the city today , archeologists , the original shoreline of Manhattan , ar  --  cheological digs in Jerusalem , arche  --  ological roots in old Greece , and other things along those lines . The people were there at the request of the Land  --  marks Preservation Commissioner , a large man with large , very white teeth , which anyone could see when he smiled , and he smiled a lot . The Mayor was late , and these people whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archeologist , and the Mayor speak wandered around almost aim  --  lessly when they were n't signing a piece of paper that said if they fell down and hurt themselves they would n't sue anybody . Then the May  --  or arrived , and suddenly all these people , with their disparate profes ? sional interests , and maybe even dis  --  parate personal interests , found a common ground : all attention was now focussed on the Mayor . He walked over to the Landmarks Preservation Commissioner and the archeologist and greeted them . Then , while the Land  --  marks Preservation Commissioner and the archeologist made their speeches , the Mayor stuck his hands deep in his trouser pockets , glanced up and down , knit his eyebrows , made creases in his forehead , unmade the creases in his forehead , turned to look at what the people behind him were doing , looked up at the blue sky , looked down at his shiny black shoes , rubbed the area above his left cheek and just under  --  neath his lower eyelid with the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his left trouser pocket , pursed his lips , unpursed his lips , rocked his head from side to side , turned again to look at what the men behind him were doing , squinted his eyes , unsquint  --  ed his eyes , pressed his Lips tightly to  --  gether , then stretched them out in a Cheshire-cat smile , looked up at some pigeons flying by , took his left hand out of his left trouser pocket again , and rocked his head from side to side again . Later , we asked the Mayor what was going through his mind during the time the Landmarks Preservation Commissioner and the archeologist were making their speeches . Without missing a beat , the Mayor said , " I was thinking how proud I am to be the one-hundred-and-fifth Mayor of the City of New York . "
