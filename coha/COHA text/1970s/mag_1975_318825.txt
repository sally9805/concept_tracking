Jackie and Aristotle Onassis reportedly drew up a 170-point marriage contract covering every possible detail of their married life . In 1969 , Kleenex Heir James Kimberly , then 63 , and his third wife , Jacqueline Trezise , then 19 , signed a prenuptial contract limiting any possible alimony payments to $18,000 for every year of marriage .

In fact , some of Sussman 's contracts , which he calls " therapeutic , " were written in mid-marriage with the help of a therapist or counselor , mainly to " get the most obvious kinds of annoying behavior out on the table . " Two representative provisions : " Wife will not say she does not believe her husband loves her " and " husband will lift the toilet seat before urinating . "
