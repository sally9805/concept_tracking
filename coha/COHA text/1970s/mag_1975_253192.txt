Seven months after early signs of recovery from recession became visible in the U.S. , they are appearing in Europe , too . They are confined to a few key indicators ( auto sales , appliance and consumer buying ) and are most evident in two key countries : West Germany and France . Nonetheless , says Italian Economist Luigi Spaventa , voicing a general European view , " I expect we 've hit bottom . Now it depends on how long we keep crawling along down there . " <P> The outlook in the four most important countries : <P> <P> WEST GERMANY is regaining some of its old economic vigor . Exports have spurted to near-record levels , and domestic auto sales may equal the 2.1 million record set in 1972 . But unemployment has climbed above 1 million and seems certain to get worse before improvement begins next spring . <P> FRANCE is getting the benefit of a $7 billion pump-priming program begun in September . Consumers are buying again , and manufacturers are stepping up production to replenish inventories . For 1976 the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present 12% inflation rate to 7.5% . <P> ITALY notes improvements in several key industries , notably autos , leading Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli to say : " We could perhaps conclude that we are coming out of the most acute phase of the recession . " But overall industrial output is down 12% from 1974 , and 1.2 million workers are jobless ; another 800,000 are on short time . Industrialists fear , too , that an improving climate may encourage wage demands and strikes that could abort the recovery . <P> BRITAIN is experiencing a slowing of the rate of decline in gross domestic product , an indication that the economy is bottoming out . Still , the country faces huge obstacles . Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's pact with the unions , which holds wage increases to $12 a week , could reduce the inflation rate from this year 's staggering 25% . But unemployment , now 1,250,000 , is expected to remain at that painfully high level next year , and economic growth is forecast to be a paltry 1.8% . <P> Among Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Netherlands are still preoccupied with combatting their high rates of inflation . Switzerland has shipped home 100,000 foreign workers to stave off unemployment among citizens , but its recovery is dependent on the renewed health of its big trading partners . Sweden , which long seemed immune to recession , has started on a slide that is expected to result in zero growth this year . By contrast , Denmark achieved modest expansion during 1975 , and Norway is being buoyed by prospects of soon becoming a sizable oil producer . The Norwegian economy grew a respectable 5.1% this year , and unemployment amounts to only an insignificant 1.4% of the labor force .
