txt Gwen Welker , a secretary for Atlantic Richfield for the last 21 Mars , has found a new way to spend her lunch hour : sipping Pepsi and munching sandwiches around a conference table with 1 dozen other Arco employes . Mrs. Welker is learning the political ropes . " You want to register the newly eligible voters in your community for your party . - low do you find them ? " asks the leader of he discussion . " Get the graduation list from he high school . " answers Mrs. Welker . Her fellow students nod in agreement . Mrs. Welker has never been involved in Aectoral politics before , but this fall she is 31anning to get out and " nng some doorDells " fur her Congressman But first she plans to tell him that " Uncle Sam ought to stay out of the oil business I 'm going to tell him that if the U.S. government regulates the oil business too much . it 's going to regulate a lot of people in his district who work for Arco nght out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of what business likes to call the " grass-roots political movement . " Arco and hundreds of other companies , together with the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , are pounng a lot of corporate dollars and energy into organizing employes and shareholders into a concerted voice powerful enough to make the congressional ear listen to business views . " Clearly a Trend " What ' % more , some of these employes and shareholders are putting their money where their mouths are by contributing to company-organized political funds that are enriching the election coffers of friendly politicians . " Up to this point the labor unions have dominated the ability to organize people . Now business is getting active . It 's clearly a trend , " says New Jersey Democratic Congressman James J. Florio. whose district includes many Arco employes , Mrs. Welker among them . The corporate political movement has blossomed since 1975 when the Federal Election Commission gave its blessing to the spending of corporate funds to solicit political contributions from employes . Before then , most companies were unclear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of 1974 there were a mere 139 company-sponsored fund-raising committees . But by March of this year there were 595 corporate committees , according to the commission . Certainly , this corporate clout still does n't equal that of labor , whose committees have been in operation for a long time The Election Commission says that in the 14 months ended February 28 , corporate groups raised a total of S5.9 million compared with the $9.5 million raised by labor in the same period . $138,000 in a Year Justin Dart , the chairman of Los Angeles-based Dart Industries , believes that political funds are vital to the corporate grassroots movement . Dialogue with politicians " is a fine thing . but with a little money , they hear you better . " he says . Mr. Dart raises money for his company 's political fund by writing personal letters to his executives . " If they do n't give , they get a sell , " he says . Other companies are soliciting among all levels of employes . International Paper , which started its political fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from payroll deductions alone . And in one year , General Electric raised more than $138,000 . Of course , relatively few employes and shareholders are actually contributing money . But many more are deeply involved in the political information efforts being mounted by companies such as General Motors . General Telephone &; Electronics , Owens-Illinois , PepsiCo . Continental Group , Armco and many others . The programs vary widely . Dart 's , for example , offers heavy doses of " economic education . " But there is a common thread : A company organizes political education or discussion groups for its employes ; manage . ment gives its views on issues that concern the company and urges employes to study the matter further . The corporate hope is that the employes will then " begin to reflect their opinions to Congressmen and Senators " as well as to state and local officials , says John J. Meehan , public-affairs vice president of the Chamber of Commerce . Evidence of Power The chamber is closely involved with the growing political movement . Three years ago it was sending periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides the reports to 350 companies . This spring the chamber helped sponsor eight sessions around the country on how to set up corporate political programs . More than 1. - 000 companies sent representatives . There is no way of measuring the impact of all this organization . But Mr. Meehan sees evidence that it contributed to the defeat of bills that would have broadened Picketing rights of construction workers and that would have created a consumer-protection agency . He believes the grass-roots business lobby also helped to stall a bill that would have made union organizing easier . But not everyone is impressed . " We 've had an onslaught of telegrams and mail that obviously had been orchestrated from a particular economic viewpoint . . . that may have been corporate shareholders , " says Ben . Dale Bumpers , the Arkansas Democrat . As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee . the Senator is on a number of corporate committee lists . Sen. Bumpers believes that " orchestrated mail is n't a terribly effective way to ) obby . " He says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the other hand , he concedes that the corporate ? ommittees ' lobbying " seems to be effective with Congress in general . " The model that is often pointed to for hard-working and well-informed employes is Arco 's three-year-old Civic Action Program . The program was the idea of Thornton F. Bradshaw , Arco 's president , who was and still is concerned about bills in Congress that would force the oil companies to divest themselves of other energy properties , such as coal and uranium , and would prevent them from owning refining , transportation and marketing companies . ? The company assigned Robert P. , a 48-year-old marketing executive , to devise an effective way of getting the company 's dismay across to Congress . Mr. and Arco 's Washington lobbyists worked out " purely and simply , a political program . " The members of the program , Arco employes , retirees and stockholders , get mailings of political information and the company 's position on certain legislative issues . Arco also sponsors political action courses and it encourages contributions to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates and committees . Mr. commands a staff of six at Arco 's Los Angeles headquarters . He has a budget of about 5750,000 a year , most of which is n't a tax-deductible business expense , and a membership list of 60.000 steered by 45 committees around the U.S. The members were recruited simply by mailing a brochure to each of Arco 's 112,000 individual shareholders . 22,000 employes and 13.000 retirees . Listening to the Opposition The company got back requests for more information from 53,000 shareholders , 6,000 employes and 2,000 retirees . These were so many more than Arco had expected that the company found it had " created a monster , " says Mr. . " It 's costing us a lot of money , but we think it 's getting results . " Mr. began organizing the committees by spending a week at each of Arco 's six major locations around the U.S. After his visit to Philadelphia in 1976 , for example , some employes were asked if they would like to serve on the Philadelphia area committee . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't at the highest level so it would n't look like people were being propagandized , " says Stephen Cohen , a 35-yearold Arco engineer and project manager . Mr. Cohen 's first job on the Philadelphia committee was education director ; last year he became committee chairman . But , he says , he only volunteered after being satisfied that the committee would be able to bear all sides of a political Issue without deferring to management views . He is so insistent on this that a recent forum on natural-gas regulation included a speaker against the oil industry , as well as a speaker for the industry and a non-partisan Federal Energy Administration official . As another example , Rep. Florio , who was cited in an Arco newsletter as voting five times against oil-industry interests last year , was invited to speak to the Philadelphia branch last spring . Rep. Flono says he remains unmoved by the company 's arguments , but says that some " hard " employe questions " raised my attention and educated , Mr. Cohen has made eight trips to Los Angeles , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arco committees and quarterly meetings of the national coordinating committee . Last January . he and about 80 other Arco employes in Philadelphia attended a seminar on how to organize and become involved in a political campaign . Arco has held a total of 12 such seminars around the country with the aid of Cerrell Associates , a Los Angeles firm of political consultants and campaign managers . Organizing District Committees The Philadelphia committee is getting organized for the congressional elections in the fall . Arco recently bought a $20.000 computer program that breaks down all of its committee members into congressional districts . In June , Mr. Cohen received a list of his Philadelphia members broken down by their districts . " Between now and Labor Day we 'll form little committees of about five people per district so they can work with the members in each district , " says Mr. Cohen . The committees " will be out there monitoring " Congressman and their challengers to help members decide how to vote , he says . The computer program has another use : lobbying . When a proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska began moving through the Senate , Arco prepared a report explaining what the bill would do . The computer selected all Arco employes , shareholders and retirees living in the states represented by the Senators on the Senate energy committee . Each person then was sent a copy of the report . All of this is heady political involvement for Mr. Cohen . " This is my political reawakening , " he says . Recently he sent a check to Arco 's Concerned Citizens ' Fund . It was the first political contribution of his life . Arco 's political fund is small by comparison with those of International Paper and GE : It totaled about 429,000 last year , up from 324,000 in 1976 . But Arco does n't try too hard to persuade employes to contribute , says Mr. . Indeed , the list of Arco employes contributing to the fund through payroll deductions is kept secret from top management , he says . The contributors can earmark their donations for a certain political candidate if they wish , but most let the company fund committee decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
