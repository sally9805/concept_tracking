There would be no state funeral , announced the ruling military junta , which confined itself to a restrained statement of condolence . Nonetheless , Pablo Neruda , the protean Chilean poet and Nobel laureate who died at the age of 69 last week , was given an emotional and stirring farewell . <P> Hundreds of mourners appeared at the Communist poet 's home in Santiago for the funeral procession to the capital 's General Cemetery . In bold defiance of the junta 's anti-Marxist campaign and in obvious disregard for their own liberty , they chanted leftist slogans as the cortege marched slowly to the mausoleum . Softly at first , then louder and louder , they sang the Internationale . <P> Some shouted " Neruda y Allende , un solo combatiente Neruda and Allende , one fighter ! " As the coffin was carried into the crypt , one old woman sobbed : " We are burying Salvador Allende now . " <P> The son of a railroad worker , Neruda ( real name : Ricardo Eliezer Neftali Reyes y Basoalto ) was born in Parral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started writing poetry at the age of eight , and persisted even though his book-hating father once destroyed his notebooks . <P> Neruda 's early work was rhapsodic and lushly romantic , at once Whitmanesque and surrealistic . During the 1930s , the style and tone of his verse abruptly changed . The catalyst was the Spanish Civil War , which Neruda witnessed as a Chilean consul in Spain . <P> Shocked by the brutality of the war , and traumatized by the death of his friend and fellow poet Federico Garcia Lorca , Neruda pruned from his own writing much of its detached symbolism . Instead , he began to turn out blunt , vertiginous , often satirical verse-poetry that Neruda once described as " written with blood . " <P> Convinced Marxist . The Spanish war also turned Neruda into a convinced Communist , though political engagement did not always inspire him to great writing : during the 1940s and 1950s , for instance , he produced a series of slavish , gushing poems in praise of Stalin . <P> The Nobel committee eventually forgot them ; after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literature in 1971 . <P> Even Latin Americans who challenged his political views found it hard to quarrel with the honor . In such works as the surrealistic poem cycle Residence on Earth , and the massive Canto General , an epic on the origin of the Amer was , he proved himself to be the continent 's most creative and authentic literary voice . In one of its best-known sections , The United Fruit Co. , he mockingly writes of " Jehovah " parceling out the universe to " Coca-Cola , Inc. , Anaconda , Ford Motors , and other entities , " while the United Fruit Co. " reserved for itself : the heartland/ And coasts of my country . " <P> An eminent politician who was a Communist Party candidate for President of Chile in 1970 , Neruda served as Chile 's Ambassador to France from March 1971 until last February . With royalties from the millions of copies of his books sold round the world , he was able to buy homes in Santiago , Valparaiso and the beach resort area of Isla Negra . Yet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always convincing Marxist . He was a friend of Allende 's and perhaps his leading propagandist. *
