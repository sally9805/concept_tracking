IN its 21 years of existence , NATO has always had the rich kid 's problem : it carries plenty of big bills but is forever short of small change . U.S. nuclear warheads have protected the alliance 's 14 other members against the doomsday stockpile of any potential aggressor , but the problem has been with less powerful armaments . <P> In the 1960s , NATO planners began to broaden their defenses with a strategy of " flexible response , " employing larger numbers of conventional forces , backed by tactical nuclear weapons . But the shift in emphasis came slowly , and so did the money to finance it . Last week , however , the alliance 's foreign and defense ministers decided at a meeting in Brussels to concentrate still harder on the vital small change elements of their defenses . In what Melvin Laird called " the most important NATO meeting in my tenure as Secretary of Defense , " they adopted a $1 billion program for the 1970s that will dramatically upgrade Europe 's conventional , non-nuclear forces . <P> A.D. 70 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent disturbing developments . The most important is the growth of the Soviet Union 's nuclear inventory to near parity with that of the U.S. <P> At Laird 's suggestion , military research experts from 13 nations began work last February on an answer to the Soviet challenge . The result is a thick document called A.D. 70 ( for Alliance Defense , 1970 ) . It concluded that NATO possesses " adequate nuclear forces , " but that its conventional military strength " is less satisfactory " - quite an understatement in view of the Warsaw Pact 's 2-to-l edge in troop strength . The report recommended and the members unanimously approved : &gt; Concrete hangars for NATO aircraft . Having watched the destruction of Egypt 's air force by Israel during the Six-Day War , both NATO and the Warsaw Pact forces are anxious to cover their own fighter-bombers . <P> &gt; A buildup of tanks and antitank guns . Soviet tank tactics are far ahead of the West 's . <P> &gt; More antisubmarine devices . NATO tracking equipment has not kept pace with the enormous Soviet buildup in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , a more rapid call-up system for European reserves and standardization of communications equipment . <P> A.D. 70 is the first major NATO pro gram that will be paid for entirely by European members , who pledged to ante up some $920 million above their normal contributions over the next five years . The West Germans alone are paying for 40% of the " infrastructure " items , and will also provide low-cost credit to Turkey for its share . Even Luxembourg , with its army of 560 men , responded to the call and doubled its normal pledge ( to $1,900,000 ) .
