By most conventional signs , the prices of food to the U.S. consumer should now be coming down after two years of dizzying and painful rises . Prices received by farmers for some key items - wheat , corn , cattle , hogs-dropped sharply last spring , record harvests are anticipated and the surge in agricultural exports that did much to boost U.S. food prices last year is now waning ( TIME , July 1 ) . Yet only a few grocery prices - for poultry , eggs , dairy goods and some cuts of beef and pork-have come down significantly . On average , retail food prices rose .9% in May , a month during which wholesale food prices dropped .6% . During the first quarter of 1974 , the prices that farmers got for all the ingredients going into white bread fell 32%-but the store price for the finished loaves scooted up 5.5% . <P> Why ? Part of the answer is a lag in prices from farm to supermarket . For example , Arnold Bakers , a New York breadmaker , until recently was paying $13.50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spring - though the immediate-delivery price for flour fell as low as $9.60 , reflecting declines in wheat . Also , some agricultural prices have kept on rising : sugar recently hit a record 26 per lb. , boosting prices of goods ranging from Life Savers to Kool-Aid soft drinks . But the biggest reason is that " middlemen " ( a term covering bakeries , canners , meat packers , supermarket chains and trucking firms ) are not passing along to housewives much of the decline in farm prices . <P> Instead , they are keeping their own prices high , or even raising them further , to cover inflated operating costs that they must pay , and to refatten profits that were squeezed thin during the period of price controls and freezes ( farm prices were never under any sort of control ) . Supermarkets are also trying to recover losses suffered early last year as a result of a recently ended price war launched by A. &; P. that kept retail prices from soaring even higher . <P> Share Dips . As a result , the spread between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same goods has widened markedly ( see chart ) . Last August farmers were getting an unusually high 52 of every dollar that the housewife spent for food ; in May their share was down to 40 . The remaining 60 went to the middlemen . <P> Middlemen are quick to argue that they are merely regaining their traditional share of the retail food dollar - but in doing so at a time when farm costs are still high by historic standards , they are adding substantially to food prices . Food processors and retailers assert that they need the money to pay steadily rising bills of their own . Atlanta-based Colonial Stores , for example , reports that its wage costs have risen 10% to 12% in the past year . Gasoline and electric costs have shot up as much as 50% in the past eight months ; and for some food processors , the price of tin-plated steel used to make cans has leaped 30% . Los Angeles Wholesaler Randolph Price asserts : " There is not much chance for retail prices to diminish . There are too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product by the time it gets to the store .
