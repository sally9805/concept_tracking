House Republican Leader John Rhodes Ariz. says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Former New York Gov . Nelson Rockefeller tells " deep sense of sorrow and dismay . " Page 14 . " I have read all the transcripts and the overwhelming weight of evidence and truth from many other sources convince me he is not guilty of any impeachable offense . There should be no resignation . " Asked to comment on the Chicago Tribune editorial yesterday calling for Nixon 's resignation or impeachment , Ford said , " I 'll let others speak for themselves . " HE SAID also that he would not pass judgment on the language used by the President as disclosed by the edited transcripts of White House tape recordings . Ford said he was sure that frank language had been used before in the Oval Room of the White House but had not been made public . The Vice President praised Nixon for having what he called the finest record in history for achieving peace . But he said the President , along with other people , has legal rights " and should not be forced to turn over everything everyone asks him for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate should not be made available to the House Judiciary Committee // Confidence gap nears crisis level , Ford says // Vice President Ford speaking into tape recorders at the University of Chicago . // " under any circumstances , " he said . But the White House should consider releasing more if the Judiciary Committee wishes more after studying the evidence already before it , he said . IN HIS CHARLESTON address , the Vice President made reference to pending criminal cases and House Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment and said : " The legal , judicial and constitutional processes are already in operation which will settle the guilt or innocence of those involved in the charges of corruption , dishonesty , or violations of the law . " There will be some pluses from the very operation of this cleansing process , a recognition that the law applies to holders of high offices as well as to the citizen who elects the officeholder . " " WE MUST insure that this stain of corruption which has spread so widely does not have a chance to spread again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glue that holds government together . " I firmly believe it is time to put more truth in politics ? that the time has come for persons in political life to face the . truth and to speak the truth . " The crowd in Charleston was generally friendly to the Vice President and interrupted his address 24 times with loud applause . Small bands of student demonstrators also interrupted his half-hour speech occasionally with shouts of " Impeach Nixon " and " give up the tapes . " OUTSIDE LANTZ gymnasium at Eastern Illinois University , small groups also chanted during the speech and carried signs , including one w h I c h read : " If it 's good enough for The Tribune , it 's good enough for me . " This apparently was ' a reference to the Tribune 's editorial calling for Nixon 's impeac:iment or resignation .
