" I 've been singing and dancing since I was a kid , and I never had a chance to use it in any of my movies , " complains Actress Raquel Welch , 35 . That , she says , is why she has begun a ten-week nightclub tour through Mexico , the U.S. and Europe . In Mexico City , she notes happily , a sellout crowd of 1,200 paid $80 apiece to catch her song-and-dance act on New Year 's Eve . At the Concord Hotel in upstate New York , 3,400 customers came for her show , setting a record for the hotel . Says Raquel : <P> " I think people sit down at 80 bucks a whack to have a look at somebody who is a movie star , who is a bigger-than-life image . " Do they get their money 's worth ? " They want to see me out of curiosity . When I deliver a performance , I think that 's the coup . " <P> There is a set of chopsticks used by Richard Nixon in China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust of the former President and a full display of cufflinks , matchboxes , pens and playing cards from his years in the White House . All are part of a one-room minimuseum opened on Nixon 's 63rd birthday last week at the San Clemente Inn , near his California home . " Not everyone approves , but every day people thank me for doing it , " said the inn 's owner , Paul Presley , adding that the former President had given his blessing to the project . Despite its decidedly small scale , the exhibit just might be the last , as well as the first , to be dedicated to Nixonalia . In Washington , a three-judge federal panel denied the ex-President possession of the 42 million documents and 880 White House tapes accumulated during his Administration . Nixon 's claim that the material belonged solely to him was dismissed as " without merit " by the court . <P> Suffering from dry skin ? Maybe a wrinkle or two ? Consider the remedy used by Actress Doris Day , 51 . " One night a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forehead to toes , with Vaseline , " she reveals in a new biography , Doris Day , Her Own Story , by A.E . Hotchner . " I then put on a flannel nightgown and lightweight socks to cover my feet and go to sleep like that . " The gooey cure poses some problems . She cautions : " If you 're sleeping with a man , husband or otherwise , you are not a very appetizing number in this condition , and it 's best to be in a separate bed on this occasion . " <P> At 58 , she is no longer the same young girl who shared a sleeping bag with Gary Cooper in For Whom the Bell Tolls back in 1943 . " I 've reached an age where I am starting a new career as a character actress , " says Ingrid Bergman , now at work on her 43rd film . The movie , which will be titled A Matter of Time in English-speaking countries and Nina elsewhere , stars Bergman as an aged contessa and Liza Minnelli as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergman , who still needs nearly an hour-long makeup job to affect the wrinkled look , says the contessa " is just the opposite of my own character because she is destroying herself by dreams of her youth . " She adds , " I do n't dream about my past . I accept my age and make the best of it . " <P> The playbills called it a " musical romantic comedy , " but the critics decided that Home Sweet Homer was tragic .
