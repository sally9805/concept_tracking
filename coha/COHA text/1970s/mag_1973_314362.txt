Although the Iron Curtain is less rigid than it used to be , Western newsmen are still welcomed cautiously in East Germany . After arriving in Leipzig , 90 miles southwest of the Berlin Wall , Chief European Correspondent William Rademaekers and Bonn Bureau Chief Bruce Nelan discovered that their time was not to be entirely their own . " The authorities , " Rademaekers says , " had organized a togetherness program stretching over two weeks . " Reluctantly , G.D.R . officials gave in to the correspondents ' request to split up : Rademaekers traveled east to the Polish border , while Nelan went as far south as " Saxon Switzerland " near the Czech border . <P> Both correspondents found that the many East Germans they interviewed outside Berlin were friendlier-and far more talkative-than the uptight " press officers " in the capital . " Sometimes it was difficult to break away from their exemplary hospitality , " says Nelan , who endured a four-hour tour of an alloy steel mill . Rademaekers met with more warmth than he had bargained for . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complains , " and every window seemed locked up for the winter . " <P> Nelan , a TIME correspondent since 1965 , first visited East Germany last year , when he became Bonn bureau chief . Rademaekers , who has served in most of the European bureaus of TIME since joining in 1959 , got his first taste of East Germany more than twelve years ago , and has been back as recently as last summer for a retrospective on the Berlin Wall . <P> <P> The land boom , the personalities associated with it , the way land is used , and abused , in this country : these issues are the subject of a special section in this week 's issue . Senior Editor Marshall Loeb supervised the project . Senior Editor Leon Jaroff and Associate Editor George Church split the task of editing the copy . Business Writer Donald Morrison dealt with the boom itself , Environment Writer Philip Herrera discussed the problems of land use , while Nation Writer Edwin G. Warner and Science Writer Frederic Golden contributed other features . This editorial team received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all of TIME 's U.S. news bureaus . <P> The " interdisciplinary " approach , which we have used before on major projects , seemed especially necessary in this case . Says Loeb : " From the way traffic moves through a city to the price of oil and food , the problem of land use has something to do with everyone in America . "
