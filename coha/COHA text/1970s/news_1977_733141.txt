txt The Soviet Union appears to be going out of its way to tell President Carter that his criticisms on human rights have no effect on the current hard line against dissidents here . Nor does Moscow seem inhibited by the 35-nation gathering in Belgrade starting June 15 to prepare for a general review of human rights and other issues later in the year . In fact , quite the reverse ? Western analysts here see Moscovii trying to draw a clear line between human rights ( which the Soviets say they respect scrupulously ) , and criminality ( which they impute to dissidents here and to those Western diplomats and newsmen in contact with them ) . The ' latest Soviet signal comes from behind the yellow stucco walls that surround the KGB prison of Lefortovo in Moscow . For four hours June 14 , an American correspondent , Robert C. Toth of the Los Angeles Times : . was questioned about allegations he had received secret information from a Soviet scientist June 11 . . The questioning followed a statement by the Soviet Foreign Ministry earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in collecting " secret information of a political and military chiracter . " Mr. Toth is the fifth American , correspondent resident in Moscow to be linked by the Soviets to underhanded activities in a year . He was told to report back for more questioning June 15 ( the opening day of the Belgrade meeting ) and was effectively prevented from leavthe country . ( He was due to end his threeyear assignment June 17 . But the U.S. Embassy has been told his departure is " not desired " until investigations are completed . ) The timing of the actions against him appeared to challenge Mr. Carter directly in these ways : - The accusation of gathering secret infor- From page 1 Soviets issue . tough ' rights signal mation was made after the U.S. Embassy here had delivered a protest against the way Mr. Toth was detained for questioning three days before ( June 11 ) . The U.S. State Department had deplored the detention June 13 in public . ( Mr. Toth had met a Soviet scientist June 11 , at the scientist 's urgent request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including extrasensory perception . This is officially frowned on here . Five agents then appeared and held Mr. Toth for three hours . ) ? At his latest press conference Mr. Carter had personally denied a Soviet charge against dissident Anatoly Shcharansky , who has been in the same Lefortovo Prison since March 15 . The Soviets say they are accusing Mr. Shcharansky of treason because he allegedly helped spy for the Central Intellige-nce Agency . Mr. Carter said he had found no links between Mr. Shcharansky and the CIA . ? A recent report by Mr. Carter repeated previous U.S. charges that the Soviet Union has violated human-rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 . This earned Mr. Carer the harshest personal criticism he has yet received from the Soviets . Now Moscow has acted against a newsman who has often written about dissidents , and has covered science and defense . Other warnings seen Western analysts see these other warnings in the latest Soviet actions : ? To other Western countries attending the Belgrade meeting : No amount of Western pressure will divert the Kremlin from acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lefortovo Prison late June 14 , Mr. Toth said he gained the impression from chief of the KGB investigation unit , Maj. 0 . A. Dobrovolsky , that any scientific informa- tion gained through nonofficial sources could be considered secret . Mr. Toth was told to appear for questioning as a " witness . " But he is still not sure if this means against someone else or against himself . Questions June 14 were confined to his June 11 meeting with the Soviet scientist . Thus the Soviets have left the door open for a serious formal charge against Mr. Toth ? or a quick expulsion when he was preparing to leave anyway ( after giving him , his wife , and three children some anxious moments ) . ? To dissidents themselves . The Warning : Do not associate with Western newsmen . Even as Mr. Toth emerged from questioning , those . dissidents who are still out of jail are telling Western newsmen of new arrests in Leningrad and elsewhere on the eve of Belgrade . ? To U.S. and Western newsmen here : Keep away from dissidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
