Pan American World Airways seemed , until a few days ago , to have found a most ironic way out of a financial nosedive caused largely by doubled fuel bills . The government of Iran , one of the nations most instrumental in forcing up petroleum prices , had been negotiating to provide the airline with $300 million so that it could pay off restless American creditors and rebuild working capital . Last week irony was followed by intense disappointment ; the deal appeared to have fallen through , leaving Pan Am facing another money squeeze . <P> Though the Iranians refused to say whether the loan was on or off , the signs were not encouraging . Pan Am Chairman William Seawell went to Tehran last month with high hopes for progress , but returned without ever seeing the Shah . He was told by other Iranian officials that all proposed foreign loans are " under review . " Despite high oil prices , slackened world demand cut Iran 's petroleum revenue by $4 billion last year , to $16 billion , and Iranian Ministries are jostling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Privately , Iranians also express worry about Pan Am 's first-quarter loss of $59 million . " There was never any commitment on the part of Iran , " says Hushang Ansary , Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance , who had helped draw up the loan plan with Pan Am . <P> Skimpy Profit . Pan Am will not be grounded-at least not immediately . A small tax credit and changes in accounting methods enabled the airline to show a skimpy profit of $4 million for the second quarter . Through rigid cost-cutting measures that included reducing employment by 3,100 , Pan Am has lowered its break-even point from a too-high 58% of seats filled to an acceptable under 50% . Still , the airline slipped back into the red by $4.7 million during June , and a huge loss for all 1975 appears inevitable . A new crunch will come in the fall , when Pan Am 's $125 million line of short-term credit expires and a consortium of U.S. banks will have to decide whether to make more loan money available . <P> Before long , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , if any , it is prepared to extend to Pan Am and the other major U.S. international airline , TWA ( which lost $86.8 million in the first half of 1975 ) . One senior Pan Am executive has constructed what he calls a " prayer mat " : a graph that contrasts the lavish government benefits received by foreign airlines with the absence of any special assistance to Pan Am and TWA . <P> Pan Am will soon be laying the prayer mat before Administration and congressional investigators . Secretary of Transportation William Coleman has ordered a study of Pan Am and TWA to consider all possible solutions . Among them : federal subsidy ( which the two lines were denied last year ) , a forced TWA-Pan Am merger , or dismemberment of Pan Am and allocation of its foreign routes among domestic U.S. carriers .
