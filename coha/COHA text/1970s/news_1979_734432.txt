txt President Carter is responding in a major way to help relieve the famine in Cambodia , but American religious , civic , and congressional leaders are urging him to do even more . The President coupled a pledge of $30 million in relief aid for Cambodia Oct. 24 with an appeal for major contributions from private citizens . He called on Americans to devote every Saturday and Sunday between now and Thanksgiving to gathering such contributions in churches and synagogues . In addition to the pledge of cash and food to be donated to international relief efforts , the President is allocating $9 million in immediate aid for desperate Cambodians now entering Thailand in large numbers . These contributions , with another $30 million authorized by a congressional committee , will make the United States by far the largest contributor to the relief efforts now under way . There were these additional developments Oct. 24 which served either to support President Carter or to prod him to further action on behalf of starving Cambodians : ?

" The group , which was called together by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh , president of the University of Notre Dame and chairman of the board of the Overseas Development Council , also proposed that American government agencies give the relief efforts highest priority and seek the . cooperation of Pope John Paul II , the Soviet Union , and China in the efforts . ? Three US senators were reported by United Press International to have scored a " partial breakthrough " on a mission to Cambodia . One of the three , James Sasser ( D ) of Tennessee , told reporters in Bangkok , Thailand , upon return from Phnom Penh that Cambodian Foreign Minister Hun Sen had accepted their proposal of a " land bridge " for relief supplies entering Cambodia . He told the senators he would pass it on to his government 's Central Committee for approval . // From page 1 Politicians vie over Cambodia relief Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposed truck convoy to carry 1,000 tons of food and medical supplies a day from Thailand . The three senators . are to report to President , Carter at the end of this week . ? Edward M. Kennedy , chairman of the Senate subcommittee on refugees and President Carter 's most likely challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1980 , called for a massive airlift of food and medicine to Cambodia as well as for an international conference and immediate diplomatic steps aimed at ending the continuing fighting in Cambodia . In a speech delivered at Georgetown University here , the Massachusetts Senator welcomed President Carter 's promise of American assistance for Cambodia but described it as " only a first installment , compared with the need which now exists . " As part of a six-point program for Cambodia , Senator Kennedy urged that the US work to bring strong pressure to bear on Vietnam and the Vietnamese-supported government in Phnom Penh to resolve the Cambodian crisis . The Senator declared that while Secretary of State Cyrus Vance had acknowlddged in a Senate hearing as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter administration had been slow to act . Asked by a Georgetown student if the administration 's alleged slow response on this issue was typical of its performance as a whole , Senator Kennedy laughed and said only that " history will judge . " Administration officials argue that delays in getting American relief efforts going could be attributed more in the initial stages to an inability to work out arrangements with the warring parties in Cambodia than to anything else . Officials also note that UNICEF and the International Red Cross did not issue their joint appeal for international assistance until last week . But one official also admitted : " We ca n't boast that our budgetary process has been a high-speed one on this issue . " In their initial reaction , administration officials appeared skeptical of Senator Kennedy 's appeal for new diplomatic initiatives , including an international conference on Cambodia . These officials argue that American leverage over the main parties to the Cambodian conflict is limited and that the parties , including China and the Soviet Union , have shown littl ? inclination to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thailand have , in the meantime , risen sharply .
