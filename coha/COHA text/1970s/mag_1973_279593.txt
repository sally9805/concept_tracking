WAR 'S END/COVER STORlES <P> AT last , a truce . At last , after a season of false moves and false dawns , the papers were signed . At last , after years of death and destruction , the war that four U.S. Presidents had considered a necessary act of resistance against international Communism was ending in an ambiguous stalemate . For the U.S. , at least , it was over . In Viet Nam , fighting may well resume-or never entirely stop . Yet for the moment , those on all sides who had once sought victory now felt an exhausted sense of relief . <P> When President Thieu announced the settlement last week , Saigon burst out in a blaze of color . South Viet Nam 's red-striped flag suddenly appeared everywhere . Banners strung from lampposts proclaimed a great victory . But the mood of the people did not match the display . There was no dancing in the streets , or anywhere else . There were no cheers , not even any more smiles than usual . At the Givral cafe , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio carried Thieu 's message , and half the customers did not pay any attention . " It is only a piece of paper , " remarked a government minister . " Its value depends entirely on the future . " <P> <P> The reaction in the U.S. was similarly subdued . In Wayne , Mich. , Mayor Patrick Norton interrupted a debate of the city council to ask if the councilmen would like to hear President Nixon 's speech on the settlement . They preferred to continue discussing a proposed apartment building for senior citizens . " I thought it all very strange , " said the mayor . " We waited all these years for the war to be over , and then we were too busy to hear the announcement . " <P> Bingo . Members of the NCO club at Fort Jackson , S.C. , were also too busy . Only a dozen watched Nixon on television , while more than 300 continued to play bingo . When WLS-TV in Chicago interrupted the all-star basketball game to carry the President 's speech , the station was flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Houston Mayor Louis Welch issued no formal statement . He explained : " People view the end of this war with more thanksgiving than celebration . " The Boston Globe commented that the war concludes " not with a cheer but a sigh . " <P> At the time the cease-fire was actually to go into effect , Richard Nixon led the nation in prayer . It was an extraordinary hour for him personally . <P> <P> Regardless of the questions that would haunt the U.S. for years-whether this kind of peace could have been achieved earlier , whether all the violence , the death , the deviousness of the last four years were ultimately worth it-he had accomplished the American exit from Viet Nam . He had not achieved the terms he had originally proclaimed , but the U.S. was out and Thieu was still in office in Saigon .
