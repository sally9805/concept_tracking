txt PROGRESSES AND ENTRIES Trumpets and Citie Musique were placed in severall parts , sounding and playing , which together with the severall , continuall , and joyfull acclamations of the people , gave great content to both their Majes-ties ; the little Conduit in Cheapside , and the Conduit in Fleetstreet running with wine , as the other two Conduits had done in the Morning ' ( p. 21 ) . The choir from St. Paul 's greeted the sovereign with an anthem of praise to God and prayers for their Majesties ' long lives . The writer also refers to the festivities at the Guildhall . John Taylor adds that at eight o'clock in the morning the Alder-men and members of the City Council went to the Lord Mayor 's house until all were ready to go to Moorfield where the king was initially greeted . The author adds with some hyperbole : The banks , hedges , highwayes streets , stalls , and windowes were all embroy-dered with millions of people , of all sorts and fashions. ' 27 All along London Wall as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within places conveniently railed with timber , their standings being adorned with Flags , Banners , Pendants , and Escouchions . . . ' ( p. 4 ) . For the journey at night from the Guild-hall to the palace of Whitehall the full forces again accompanied the king and his retinue with fourteen trumpeters and all instruments of musick usuall , with Bells ringing at 121. parish Churches , where there was no failings in expressions of love and loyalty by the people as appear 'd by their shouts and acclamations . . . ' ( p. 5 ) . The verses presented to Charles are commensurate with the euphoric atmo-sphere ; for example : When He , ( our SUNNE of joy ) from us set forth His Raies illustrious , lighted all the North : Whilst sighes like Clouds , and showers of Teares and Cares , Was Londons and faire Englands Southerne shares . But this returne our sadnesse doth destroy , Our Teares of griefe are turn 'd to Teares of joy Hee 's come to salve this Kingdomes discontents , To cure all wrenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 7 ) But not all the expense ( the entertainment at the Guildhall alone cost over ? 1,786 ) , 28 nor all the noise , nor the hopeful and senti-mental verses can eradicate what subsequently followed in Charles 's increasingly bitter fight with Parliament . Captain Robert Slingesby in writing to Sir John Penington states it succinctly : Since the King 's // coming all things have not happened so much to his contentment as by his magnificent entertainment was expected . ' 29 No doubt the king was pleased with the entertainment , and the city was probably relieved at last to have the honour of the sovereign 's presence after several previously futile efforts . But there is still one significant difference between this 1641 entry of Charles and the earlier ones of Elizabeth and James : here in the Caroline entry there are no dramatic presentations , no pageants . Perhaps the city simply did not have time to construct such things , or perhaps they had grown wary , considering the experiences of 1626 and 1633 in London . In a few months the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pageant stage with other theatres will close its doors . Though , as was suggested at the beginning of this chapter and confirmed in subsequent pages , the progress pageant as a viable form was already for all practical purposes dead and the royal entry scarcely alive . The decline in the number and quality of pageants associated with the sovereign is commensurate with the demise apparent in the regular theatre , the much-discussed decadence ' of Caroline drama . The seeds of this decline in pageantry sown in the Jacobean era bear their fateful fruit here in the reign of Charles I. A reluctant king and changing political and economic conditions had much to do with this negative evolution ; certainly political insta-bility plays havoc with any serious attempt at pageantry or else the entertainments become overblown with complimentary hypocrisy . When the light of life does flicker in the pageant theatre , as in 1633 , then the basic dramatic ingredients are again in evidence . We continue to be in the presence of non-realistic drama , a drama populated by historical , mythological , and allegorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on visual attention . Unfortunately , the Caroline royal entry makes no signi-ficant new contribution to the pageant stage ; we would not be cynical to conclude that we have seen or heard it all before . The spontaneity which surrounded so much Elizabethan pageantry is long since gone ; the well-structured pageant drama of the Jacobean age remains largely a memory . Before we wrongly conclude that all was bleak in the reign of Charles , we must give a hearing to what became the dominant pageant form in the Stuart period : the Lord Mayor 's Show . Part Two is concerned with this other side of the pageant coin minted in Renaissance England . 121 Part two The Lord Mayors ' Shows For quite some time there had been processionals at the annual installation of the new Lord Mayor of London , but it is not until the mid-sixteenth century that a show or civic pageant emerges as a permanent part of the festivities . These new pageants supplant the Midsummer Shows ' which the trade guilds presented in the early part of the Tudor reign ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing from the scene . When the attention shifted to the inauguration of the mayor each 29th of October and the guilds began to compete with one another to see which company could produce the most elaborate pageant , then the end of the Midsummer Shows was at hand.l Like the royal entry , the Lord Mayor 's Show was basically a pro-cession through London as the new mayor made his way to West-minster to take his oath of office . On his return to the city and to the Guildhall the company of which he was member would present its dramatic show consisting generally of various dramatic tableaux stationed along the route . In the simplest form there would be only one device ? generally true of the Elizabethan mayoralty pageant ? but elaboration set in , and thus the number of devices increased , and entertainment on the Thames was added . // The chapters which follow will demonstrate some of the ways in which the several forms of civic pageantry are related , with the Lord Mayor 's Show bearing the closest kinship to the royal entry pageants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , and content . Something of the pattern of development sketched in the preceding three chapters will be evident here as well . Well-known dramatists become involved with the mayoralty shows as they had with the progress and royal entry entertainments . Moral allegory , mythology , and history will provide the basic content for these shows as they did for the other forms of pageantry . Like the royal entry , the Lord Mayor 's Show also reaches its highest dramatic achievement in the Jacobean period ; the skilfull dramatists involved with the pageants assure this accomplishment . The Elizabethan show retains a basically simple , somewhat static form corresponding to the nature of royal entries in the comparable period , though Peele 's 1591 pageant illustrates the beginning of the shift to dramatic action . By the time of Munday 's 1611 and 1616 entertainments , Dekker 's 1612 show , and Middleton 's 1613 pageant , dramatic action is paramount and coherently sustained . And when Error in the 1613 show tempts the mayor with verbal arguments , we get a measure of how the form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display in expressing dramatic conflict . By this second decade of the 1600s , the period of the best Lord Mayors ' Shows , speech has become the handmaid of the visual , not just a step-child . 124 4 The Elizabethan Lord Mayor 's Show As the accession of Elizabeth seemed to spur various dramatic forms , civic pageantry thrived in this new atmosphere , the subject of Chapter One . This present chapter seeks to complete that picture of Elizabethan pageantry by offering a discussion of the Lord Mayors ' Shows occurring concurrently with the other forms . What emerges in the mayoral pageants of the period is a pattern paralleling in many respects the development of royal entry and progress pageants of the same era ? the religious milieu eventually fades , well-known dramatists become associated with the shows , a sophistication occurs in the dramatic action and speech . Especially conducive to the rise of the mayoralty entertainments to new heights of splendour and achievement was the increasing wealth of the merchant class , the guildsmen who were directly and exclusively responsible for the presentation of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive rivalry among the companies , each determined to do justice to its member who has been elevated to the office of Lord Mayor ; such rivalry bears good fruit in this case . Thus the Lord Mayors ' Shows join the other pageant forms to offer a kaleidoscopic view of civic drama , rich in spectacle and sense of occasion . Providing much information about the early Lord Mayors ' Shows is Henry Machyn 's Diary , covering the period 1550 ? 63 in the city of London ; in fact , he comments on some eight different mayoralty entertainments . One of the fullest accounts and one which sums up the typical show of the pre-Elizabethan era is Machyn 's description of the 1553 pageant in which his visual and aural senses were much stimulated by the colour and display of the occasion . He notes , for example , the decoration on the boat which carried the mayor down the Thames to Westminster , and all the craftes bargers // with stremars and banars. . . . ' 1 As the mayor , Sir Thomas White , Merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved on to the churchyard of St. Paul 's , every craft was set in full array furst wher ij tallmen bayreng ij gret stremars of the Mer-chand-tayllers armes . . . ' ( p. 47 ) . Other figures included one man with a drum and playing a flute and another with a great fife and two giant savage men with great clubs dressed all in green , and then cam xvj trumpeters blohyng ' and seventy men dressed in blue gowns . After a devil cam the pagant of sant John Baptyst gorgyusly , with goodly speches ; and then cam all the kynges trumpeters blowhyng , and evere trumpeter havyng skarlet capes . . . ' ( p. 48 ) . The large retinue made its way to dinner and after the feast back to St. Paul 's with all the trumpets and wettes blowhyng through Powlles , through rondabowt the qwer and the body of the chyrche blowhyng , and so home to my lord mere('s) howsse ' ( p. 48 ) . This description by Machyn indicates several typical features of the Lord Mayor 's Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly established and its general pattern suggested . Colourful cos-tume and plentiful music abound as they will throughout the history of the mayoral pageants . Allusions within the pageant to the spon-soring trade guild whether visual or verbal or both become the sine qua non of such entertainments . Machyn also refers to the pageant ' of St. John the Baptist , though he does not describe exactly what it is , but the reference to historical personages becomes a permanent part of the pageant-dramatist 's craft ; this particular saint is also associated with the guild , and we find ourselves in the medieval dramatic tradition of linking guilds with certain presentations or pageants ' . The diarist mentions goodly speeches ' , though , unfor-tunately , they are not recorded nor do we know by whom they were spoken . Speeches are thus found in some of the earliest shows , but not until they clearly become dramatic speeches do we move further in the direction of dramatic form . But the potential ingredients for drama are here as they are in other civic pageants : live actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can witness through the Eliza-bethan era is a refinement and sophistication of these native com-ponents of the incipient dramatic form . The first Lord Mayor 's Show for which the speeches are recorded comes early in Elizabeth 's reign in 1561 , when Sir William Harper , Merchant Taylor , was inaugurated into office . The speeches are contained in the guild records which also reveal other valuable in- // formation regarding the planning of the pageant . For example , one John Shutte was chosen to construct a device accordyng to suche a patterne as shalbe Devised to answer the speches. . . : 2 An artistic consciousness begins to manifest itself here . Payments made by the company include expenditures for a crown for a figure of David in the pageant , remuneration for the children who played and sang in the entertainment , expenses for several painters who assisted with the necessary construction , and the total cost for the entertainment was ? 151 14s. 9d . ( MSC , p. 44 ) . Mythological characters and one Biblical character comprise the figures presented on the pageant device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried through the city . Each personage , David , Orpheus , Amphion , Arion , and Topas , has his story ' painted about him . In addition Arion is shown sitting on a dolphin in a sea playing a harp , his traditional presentation , and Topas is shown before a table of princes . Painted on the device also are the verses of Psalm 150 , a psalm of praise that bids us praise the Lord with the sound of the trumpet : praise him with the psaltery and harp ' ( verse 3 ) . And , of course , each of the characters repre-sented here is associated with music and especially the harp . As the figure David says in the opening speech : The heavie hand of god , to m'cie wilt thou turne , And mollifie mans harte , when it with rage doth burne ; Then fall to psalme and harpe , for so I David wanne , The favor bothe of god , and Saule that furious man/ ( MSC , p. 42 ) Orpheus speaks and notes the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of music . Arion and Topas echo these sentiments in their brief speeches ; Arion notes , for instance , The harpe then pearceth heaven , the harpe the earth can move and that it Ruleth the sea , Arion can well prove . ' David , Orpheus , Amphion , speak again elaborating further the soothing power of the harp , and Amphion points out that ancient rulers used the harp to open them ther highe affaires/ when they did sitt at meate ' ( p. 43 ) . The closing speech is given by David : fl ' or why yor gentle harper may with myldenes bringe aboute // asmoche touchinge good gou'nement as they that be right stoute . Wherefore rejoyce ye londoners and hope well of yor mayre ffor neu ' did a mylder man sitt in yor chiefest chaire/ ( p. 43 ) The virtue of gentleness is thus sounded through all the speeches , thus achieving a thematic unity , always the concern of the pageantdramatist . There is an inherent didacticism here also , as we should expect ? a characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters impersonated here in the 1561 Lord Mayor 's Show appear several times in future pageants , especially Arion and Orpheus . The Biblical influence , apparent here , loses its force later ; its strength in these early shows probably reflects the continuing influence of the medieval dramatic form , especially the cycle plays , all of which conforms to a pattern observed in the royal entries of the Elizabethan period . Of passing interest is the pageant of 1566 devised by James Peele , father of the playwright and pageant-dramatist George Peele . The entertainment honoured Sir Christopher Draper , Ironmonger . An entry in the company records illustrates the remuneration given Peele : Also it is agreed that Mr Pele shall have xxxs paid him for the devising of the pagent besides the mony which he hath disburside ' ( MSC , p. 46 ) . The schoolmaster of Westminster agreed for six of his children to serve in the pageant for speeches and songs . Additional expenditures included money paid to Peele for seven pairs of gloves for the children in the pageant , 13s. 8d. for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apparelled , and several sums for painting . Of special interest was the 5s. paid to the printer for ' printing of posies , speeches , and songs that were spoken and sung by the children in the pageant ' ( p. 46 ) . Unfortunately , no printed texts survive , but the interest in having a text printed becomes a constant concern in these entertainments . It is obvious , too , that the production problems were numerous , witness the matter of breakfast for the children , and the expenses significant a total cost of L210 8s. 10d. for this show . The preparations and expenditures remind us again of such procedures in the royal entries , as in the ones in London , Bristol , and Norwich in the Elizabethan era . When in 1568 the Merchant Taylors sought to honour Sir Thomas Roe , the company called upon Richard Mulcaster , already familiar to us for his involvement with the 1559 coronation royal entry of // Elizabeth , to write the speeches and a man named Keble to oversee the construction of the pageant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ? 317 , a considerable increase over the show of just two years previous . Men were hired to carry the pageant device ; children were again involved in the presentation ( and also received breakfast ) . A certain Richard Tysdale was paid for four dozen birds and four rabbits for the pageant ( MSC , p. 47 ) . In addition Tysdale , John Holt , and Robert Pavy were appointed to give their attendance for the oversight of the pageant whilst it is a-painting and a-making ' ( p. 50 ) . The famous historian John Stow was one of thirty whifflers appointed for the procession . Fortunately , the guild records preserve Mulcaster 's speeches , though again we can not determine when the speeches might have been presented during the entertainment . The only character identified by name is the person representing St. John the Baptist , giving the show a decided religious overtone ( cf. the 1553 pageant ) . St. John begins by identifying himself as the voice in the wilderness and suggests that he has been sent by god To preache unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streighte Let workes your will bewraye The tyme of your Accompte , is come Amende your Lyves I saye . The Axe alreadie is in hande , To hew downe ev'y Tree , Which dothe not beare so pleasant frute , As god woulde it shoulde be . ( p. 48 ) The didactic intent of this speech is clear . So is the purpose of the three boys who respond by talking about the swiftness and attentiveness of the roe ( pun on the mayor 's name ) that hearkens to the voice of the prophet . The third boy notes , for example : Our Roe by sighte in governement/ Wee truste shall Rule so well/ That by his doinges suche may Learne as covet to excell ' ( p. 49 ) . A fourth boy concludes the speeches by noting that the queen has provided a place for John to preach that Roe maye heare/ The gyftes of heavenly grace ' : The Courte nowe biddes John Baptist preache , under our mayden Quene . God sende her lyf and honor longe , Her Royall crowne to weare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And suche as Roe to heare. ( p. 49 ) The deviser of the pageant has succeeded in not only compliment-ing the mayor , as was his duty , but also in flattering and honouring the sovereign , a technique repeated years later in Anthony Munday 's 1605 show in which James I received great praise . Interestingly , certain precepts , such as ffeare god , be wyse , be true , accepte no bribes ' , were to be written aboute the Pageant if it shalbe thoughte good ' ; but apparently they were deemed unnecessary , along with some moral verses , for a later statement reveals : These verses above recited were not written aboute the pageant . . . ' ( p. 50 ) . Appar-ently St. John 's admonition of repentance was adequate for con-veying the religious instruction of the show . This patent preaching is uncommon in the Lord Mayors ' Shows even in the Elizabethan era , but moral suasion remains throughout the history of these civic pageants a common , and indeed , necessary ingredient . The shows of 1575 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fairholt reprints the lengthy account of the 1575 entertainment preserved in the manuscript of a Wyllyam Smythe , citizen and harberdasher of London.3 It refers to no specifically dramatic presentation ; instead , it provides a full description of the procession through the city . In many respects it is similar to the report found in Machyn . A certain von Wedel toured England and Scotland and prepared a journal of his travels ; included is his presence at the Lord Mayor 's Show of 1584.4 He describes in detail the ceremonies when the new mayor took the oath of office , and he portrays vividly the colour and total scene of the processional , being particular about the dress of the participants and the decorations on the barges . Apparently attending the mayor 's feast , von Wedel also paid a visit to the kitchen . One curious part of the street pageant which he describes is contained in the following statement : After the trumpets some men were carrying a representation in the shape of a house with a pointed roof painted in blue and golden colours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fine apparel , one holding a book , another a pair of scales , the third a sceptre . What the others had I forget ' ( p. 255 ) . Unfortunately , there is no more . One can guess on the basis of the emblematic detail that these are allegorical figures representing perhaps Learning , Justice , and Majesty . Using such allegorical characters in symbolic garb // becomes of course in later shows a well-established practice , familiar to us already in the progress pageants and royal entries of the same period as the various pageant-dramatists reveal their indebtedness to an iconographical tradition . In 1585 the Lord Mayor 's Show made a significant step in the process of development : for the first time a well-known dramatist , George Peele , is responsible for the entertainment , and for the first time the printed pamphlet has survived and come down to us . This prepares the way for the full-scale involvement of major dramatists , such as Munday , Dekker , Middleton , Webster , and Heywood , in the Jacobean and Caroline Lord Mayors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well established procedure con-sistently adhered to in the early decades of the seventeenth century . The availability of these texts grants the mayoralty shows , as it does for other civic pageants , a permanence otherwise denied to them by scanty records of the trade guilds . Peele 's entertainment is called simply , The Device of the Pageant Borne before Wolstan Dixi , and the pamphlet contains only the speeches , no type of description as became common in the Stuart era . The pageant includes characters impersonating London , fre-quently portrayed in later pageants as in Middleton 's Triumphs of Truth ( 1613 ) , the Country , and the Thames , to be seen in Munday 's Triumphs of Re-United Britannia ( 1605 ) . The allegorical qualities of Magnanimity and Loyalty are present also , continuing traditions of medieval morality drama . Four nymphs , a Soldier , Sailor , and a figure representing Science comprise the other characters with the exception of the initial speaker . The opening speech , given by the figure riding on the back of a lynx , sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , the speaker says , to offer to the mayor This Emblem thus in showe significant ' , 5 a reflection on the tableau nature and didactic intent of the entertainment . The speaker praises London , riche and fortunate , / Famed through the Worlde for peace and happinesse ' , the figure of which Is heer advaunc't and set in Highest seat , / Beawtified throughly as her state requires ' ( p. 209 ) . The tableau is apparently arranged on a scaffold , for over London are presented in beaten golde ' the Royal Arms . The City is made happy by her friends ? Country , Thames , Soldier , Sailor , Science , and she thankes her God the Author of her peace ' and yields herself , her wealth Unto the // person of her gracious Queene , / Elizabeth renowned through the world ' ( p. 210 ) . The new mayor is bid to help preserve both kingdom and the sovereign , who Rath put your honor lovingly in trust : / That you may adde to Londons dignity . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonished to join with all of London 's friends ' in maintaining the healthy condition of the body politic . So the mayor has been duly instructed and the queen complimented , but this is quite different from John the Baptist 's sermon ' in the 1568 entertainment . When London speaks , she too praises the queen , my peerles mistresse soveraigne of my peace ' , that she may ever live and never dye : / Her sacred shrine set in the house of fame , / consecrate to eternall memorie ' ( p. 211 ) . Each of the other characters in turn offers his service to the city and the sovereign . Magnanimity observes that All English harts are glad , and well appaide , / in readines their London to defend ' , and Loyalty offers herself as The greatest treasure that a Prince can have ' . Country grants a rich encrease ' , and the Thames offers a pleasant stream where leaping fishes play betwixt the shores ' . The Soldier , Sailor , and Science are also well prepar 'd and put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . . . ' ( p. 212 ) . Having tendered their services and praise to Elizabeth , these figures are joined by four nymphs who descant further on the glories of the country . As the second nymph says : So long as Sunne dooth lend the world his light , or any grasse dooth growe upon the ground : With holy flame , our Torches shall burne bright , and fame shall brute with golden trumpets sound The honor of her sacred regiment : That claimes this honorable monument . ( p. 213 ) The fourth nymph assures us that virtue shall witness the worthiness of the queen and fame shall register Elizabeth 's princely deeds . The static tableau is thus punctuated with gracious speeches designed to offer a worthy emblem to the queen and implicit instruction to all who hear , no matter how scarce the dramatic action may be . The various voices of the pageant sing in unison a song of praise . To honour John Allot , Fishmonger , his company selected to devise the entertainment Thomas Nelson , about whom little is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer . The show survives in a printed text known simply as The Device of the Pageants Again the // text provides only the speeches , but from them we see that Nelson has placed his emphasis on allegorical figures and personages from actual English history . The opening speeches of the pageant celebrate the glory of the city and commonwealth , and the speaker who rides on a unicorn bids the new mayor : Rule now my Lord and keepe this Citie well , / reforme abuses crept into the same , / So shall your fame eternizde be for aie , / and London still preserved from decaie ' ( p. 4 ) . The principle of fame having been alluded to , we are not surprised to encounter the embodiment of Fame who sounds her trumpet and speaks . She is probably emblematically costumed , though Nelson does not indicate ; but one can expect such figures as Fame to be represented as they typically were in the iconographical tradition and in other civic pageants . Such is the case when Fame reappears in the mayoralty pageants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1590 show she refers to the peace which England knows , and she is charged to spread the news of peace everywhere That all may wish with hearts which do not faine , / our roiall peace in England still may raine ' ( p. 4 ) . Having sounded the theme of peace , Nelson pursues it through the speeches of Peace of England , Wisdom , Policy , God 's Truth , Plenty , Loyalty , and Concord , virtues reminiscent of those civic virtues presented in Elizabeth 's 1559 entry into London , the qualities which help sustain a worthy government . Policy notes , for example , that it works to prevent traitorous fact , and Both Pollicie and Wisedome will not cease , / Each night and daie for to preserve this peace ' ( p. 5 ) . God 's Truth brings comfort for your soules content , / which Englands peace doth willingly imbrace ' , and God 's Truth ' doth blesse this little land ' ( p. 5 ) . The material blessings of the country are cited by Plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony which binds all hearts in devotion to the queen . But these pleasant notes of peace are countered by the harsh voice of Ambition , who both dailie seeke to worke sweete Englands fall , / He never rests , but seekes each time and tide , / How Englands peace might soone be brought in thrall ' ( p. 6 ) . But the figure representing Commonwealth reacts to Ambition by observing that the government will seek to banish ambition and to guarantee that this peace may never cease ' and thus rid the country of vice . Nelson next gives this tension between peace and discord , stated in abstract terms , concrete reality by relating it to an actual historical event . The pageant-dramatist chooses the Jack Straw-Wat Tyler rebellion , part of the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 , a subject treated also // in the play The Life and Death of jack Straw ( printed in 1593 ) and later referred to in Munday 's 1616 show , Chrysanaleia.7 The three principal figures , Richard II , Jack Straw , and William Walworth , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two lines asking for Walworth 's help in quelling the uprising . And the rebel , Jack Straw , notes that the attempt to harm the king was thwarted by Walworth , He being Maior of London then , soone danted all our pride , / He slew me first , the rest soone fled , and then like traitors dide ' ( p. 6 ) . The figure representing Walworth , also speaks noting his achievement : I slew Jacke Straw , who sought my kings disgrace , and for my act reapt honors of great price , First Knight was I of London you may reade , and since each Maior gaines knighthood by my deede. ( p. 7 ) Richard II granted many honours to the brave Lord Mayor , and , as Walworth says , Fame her selfe still laudeth me therefore ' ( p. 7 ) . The voice of Fame sounds forth the achievement of peace ; and we have come full circle , for at the beginning of the show voices were raised in praise of peace and the allegorical manifestation of Fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity and created dramatic interest by suggesting on both the abstract and concrete levels the forces that operate against peace . His use of a former Lord Mayor and other historical figures is an important first , for almost all mayoralty pageants of the early seventeenth century will include such personages both as compliments to the trade guilds and as worthy examples to be imitated . It is also interesting to note the statement in the printed text that follows Walworth 's speech : It is to be understood that sir William Walworth pointeth to the honors wherewith the king did endue him , which were placed neere about him in the Pageant ' ( p. 7 ) . This amounts to a stage direction ' , and as such we get a further impression of the pageant as a dramatic form . The year of the great progress entertainment for Elizabeth at Elvetham , 1591 , is also the occasion of the final Lord Mayor 's Show of the Elizabethan period for which there is an extant printed text : George Peele 's Descensus Astraeae ( 1591 ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the Stationer 's Register we know that Peele had devised the pageant of 1588 , and from company 7 For a discussion of the use of the legend see my ' Jack Straw in Drama and Pageant ' , The Guildhall Miscellany . II , no. 10 ( 1968 ) , 459-63. // records we also know that he probably wrote the one for 1595 , but neither survives in pamphlet form . This 1591 entertainment , honouring the new mayor William Webbe , is a rather elaborate one including , for the first time , a speech delivered on the Thames as the mayor made his way to Westminster . The speaker congratulates the mayor on his office , bids him beautify the city with good deeds and keep his oath inviolate for thy soveraignes hope , / Vertues pure mirror , Londons great mistresse . . . ' ( p. 219 ) . He is asked to go in peace happie by sea and land , / Guided by grace , and heavens immortall hand ' ( p. 219 ) . The mayor has to be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly designed to honour Elizabeth . Indeed , she is meant to be prefigured in the person of Astraea , as the Presenter ' makes clear in the opening speech of the main land pageant device . As Peele had done in the 1585 show , this speech interprets and describes the action of the tableau . Astraea stands on the top of the device , carrying her sheephook and watching her flock , as she notes in her speech . She also keeps watchful eyes on a fountain , Garded with Graces , and with gratious traines , / Vertues divine , and giftes incomparable ' ( p. 214 ) . But two clergymen , one representing Superstition and the other Ignorance , would corrupt this fountain . As Superstition says , Stirre Priest , and with thy beades poyson this spring ' ; but Ignorance realizes the futility of their efforts : It is vaine hir eye keepes me in awe , Whose heart is purely fixed on the law : The holy law , and bootlesse we contend , While this chast nimph , this fountain doth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus thwarted by Astraea ( Elizabeth ) , and the fountain retains its peace and purity against religious corruption . Peele makes effective use of an emblematic stage property around which to suggest the contention between good and evil . Perhaps it was Peele 's technique that Thomas Dekker had in mind in part of his contribution to the royal entry entertainment presented on the occasion of King James 's official passage through London on 15 March 1604 , discussed in Chapter Two . At any rate , at the triumphal arch called Nova Felix Arabia Dekker included a Fount of Virtue which is in danger of being contaminated by Detraction and Oblivion whose efforts were also subdued by the presence of the sovereign , this time James . Helping Astraea preserve the sanctity of the fountain in Peele 's entertainment are the three Graces , Euphrosyne , Aglaia , and Thalia ( who , incidentally , are also included on Dekker 's arch mentioned above and who had been at Elvetham earlier in 1591 gracing that // pageant with their poetical presence ) . Euphrosyne suggests that Jove has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he sends her descended through the sweete transparent afire : / And heere she sits in beautie fresh and sheene , / Shadowing the person of a peerlesse Queene ' ( p. 216 ) . Aglaia says that this princely dame is Enrold in register of eternall fame ' , and Thalia observes that they lend their balm to the sacred head ' of the one who brings happiness throughout the realm . The Graces , popular in the literature and the pictorial arts of the Renaissance , also appear later in Munday 's 1609 Lord Mayor 's Show . They are joined here in the 1591 pageant by the Theological Graces , Faith , Hope , and Charity . Charity hopes that happiness may continue in the land and prays to Great Israels God , spring of all heavenly peace ' that angels will watch over the queen , and O let hir princely daies never have fine , / Whose vertues are immortall and devine ' ( p. 217 ) . Faith and Hope echo the recognition of Elizabeth 's virtue . As the Presenter 's speech notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in hir bright eies/ Sits Majestic : Vertue , and Steadfastnesse/ Possesse hir hart , sweet mercy swaies hir sword ' ( p. 215 ) . Of these qualities only Honour is personified in the pageant , and she claims that Astraea 's honour is As bright as is the burning lampe of heaven ' ( p. 217 ) and that her fame is spread throughout the world . Sitting at the feet of Astraea is Champion , armed with resolution ' , who helps chastise two Malcontents , that threat hir honors wracke ' ( p. 215 ) . Champion himself speaks of his function briefly , noting that he advances his colours in defence of the queen and will not let the misproud Malecontent ' threaten the state of one whose sacred person angels have in keep ' ( p. 217 ) . The two Malcontents recognize , as had Superstition and Ignorance , that their efforts are bootless ; as the second one observes : No marvell then although we faint and quaile , / For mightie is the truth and will prevaile ' ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entertainment . On the back part of the pageant device sits a child representing Nature , holding in her hand a distaffe , and spinning a Web ' ( pun on the mayor 's name ) , which passed through the hand of Fortune and was wheeled up by Time ' ( p. 218 ) . Time , familiar in civic drama from the first civic pageant of Elizabeth 's reign , speaks here in Peele 's show : Thus while my wheele with ever turning gyres , At heavens his heast serves earthly mens desires , // I wind the Web that kinde so well beginner : While Fortune doth enrich what Nature spinnes. ( p. 218 ) Thus each part of the show underscores the beneficial effect of Astraea 's descent , one who , though confronted with evil , can with the help of other forces quell the rebellion and cast the seeds of peace across the land . Peele achieves thematic unity , if not in the same way as Nelson . Missing here , of course , is any historical person ; instead , Peele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic possibilities of the fountain are not explored , he has given the Lord Mayor 's Show a new technique , one which will be duplicated in many other pageants , not to mention the Fountain of Self-Love in Ben Jonson 's Cynthia 's Revels . But Peele 's main concern in this civic drama is to sing a hymn in praise of Astraea , our faire Eliza ' . The Presenter sums up the pervasive sentiment : Goddesse live long , whose honors we advance , Strengthen thy neighbours , propagate thine owne : Guide well thy helme , lay thine annointed hand To build the temple of triumphant Trueth. . . . ( p. 215 ) Company records indicate that the final Lord Mayor 's Show of the Elizabethan era , the one of 1602 , was written by Anthony Munday to honour Sir Robert Lee , Merchant Taylor ; thus Munday 's long association with these civic pageants , the subject of the next chapter , an involvement which lasted until 1623 , has its beginning . A certain William Haynes also contributed a speech for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that a ship , lion , and camel were called for ; and Mr Haynes was paid for apparelling 10 scholars who represented the 9 muses and the god Apollo before my Lord Mayor in Cheapside ' ( MSC , p. 60 ) . Despite the fact that Munday was paid 30s. for printing the books of speeches ' , there is no extant pamphlet for the pageant . He was given an additional xC30 for providing the apparel for all the children in the pageant . Painters and carpenters were paid as was the person who provided breakfast for the children . The total cost for this mayoralty pageant was x ' 747 2s. 10d. -a striking increase over the ? 317 the Merchant Taylors ' spent in their previous pageant of 1568 . And with the expense of the 1602 show we may see how far the Elizabethan Lord Mayor 's Show has come , at least materially ; such cost clearly becomes the pattern for the opulent Jacobean and Caroline pageants . By the time James I ascended the throne , the Lord Mayor 's Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of a dramatic entertainment , elaborate in spectacle . The days of the simple processional through London are over , and each company begins to pride itself on its pageant ? a healthy rivalry which of course generates expensive productions . A simple measure of the development of the Elizabethan show is the material growth from a meager ? 151 spent in 1561 to an excess of ? 747 in 1602 , a handsome sum that compares favourably with what was spent on the typical Stuart pageant . Important too are the printed pamphlets which begin with the 1585 show , a practice followed rather consistently in the seventeenth century . The Elizabethan show thus sets an extremely valuable precedent that allows this form of civic pageant to be considered along with other kinds of civic drama . Without doubt one of the most significant achievements was the beginning of the association of the regular dramatists with the pageant theatre of the streets in the Elizabethan period , and their involvement continues to the closing of the theatres . Though the Elizabethan mayoralty pageant is patently didactic in intent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move into what become the three basic subject areas of the later pageants : mythology , history , and moral allegory . Its greatest debt to medieval drama is of course the morality play , and these pageants frequently suggest the basic morality tension : the conflict between virtue and vice , especially seen in Peele 's 1591 show . In keeping with allegory , the pageant-dramatist uses an emblematic method that becomes the basic tool for all writers of pageant entertainments . Nelson in his 1590 show helps point the way for the ever-increasing use of historical persons and historical legends in the pageants ? a significant new direction . The mythological characters are of course in keeping with the new Renaissance spirit and its interest in the classical tradition . Pervasive in these shows is the thematic concern for the preservation of the unity of the state against those forces that would destroy it ; hence , the great concern for the commonwealth , both national and local . Elizabeth herself receives much praise , though , understandably , not the complete apotheosis that was apparent in the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Mayor 's Show demonstrates that there was a vast common ground that existed among all forms of civic pageantry , the mayoralty pageant sharing with the progress entertainment its predilection for mythology and with the royal entry its historical and allegorical bias as well as its processional form . The developments in the Tudor Lord Mayor 's Show are // essentially those discussed in Chapter One concerning the Elizabethan entries and progresses : well-known dramatists becoming involved , fading of the religious emphasis , preparing of texts . Thematically the different kinds of pageants frequently develop along parallel and sometimes coincidental lines . We witness in the Elizabethan period a homogeneous dramatic development no matter the precise form which the civic drama might take . Civic pageantry occurring in different places , at different times , under different auspices nevertheless evolves a generic form . It is a form that the Stuart and Caroline dramatists build upon as has been seen in earlier chapters and that will be demonstrated anew in the chapters that follow as we study the dramatists to whom was entrusted the task of shaping a civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 139 5 Anthony Munday Out of an enormously varied and prolific career it was all but inevitable that Anthony Munday try his hand at Lord Mayors ' Shows , and it is his spirit which broods over almost the entire Jacobean period . For his dramatic productions Munday had earned recognition from Francis Meres in Palladis Tamia where he is cited as being among the best for comedy ' with the additional compliment that he is our best plotter ' . But Munday 's interests eventually turn from the public to the pageant theatre and such things as his additions to Stow 's Survey of London . Already we have noted his involvement with the final mayoralty pageant of the Elizabethan era and his authorship of an entertainment presented in 1610 in honour of Prince Henry 's being made Prince of Wales . In the period 1602 ? 23 Munday had a hand in the production of at least fifteen Lord Mayors ' Shows , his participation ranging from merely submitting a proposal to being fully responsible for the pageant ; and if we had more information about the Shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign , we might be able to assign even more to Munday 's credit . Quantitatively , the indefatigable Munday is second to none in involvement in the Jacobean Lord Mayors ' Shows ; as such he gives us a good measure of its development and achievement . For whatever the reason , Munday 's pageant efforts seemed to provide a natural target for some of his fellow dramatists . The rivalry between Munday and Thomas Middleton got a bit heated ; for example , Middleton sneered at Munday , the impudent common writer ' , in the prologue to the scenario of his 1613 Lord Mayor 's Show , though Munday actually assisted him with the production as Middleton clearly indicates at the end of the text . Again in 1619 , Middleton scoffs at those previous shows wherein Art bath been but weakly imitated and most beggarly worded ' . At best the collaboration between the two must have been uneasy . Munday was satirized // in the character of Post-haste ' in the play Histriomastix , but perhaps the earliest satirical allusion came in Ben Jonson 's The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure of Antonio Balladino ' , Pageant Poet to the city of Milan . In Jonson 's play Antonio ( alias Munday ) appears in the second scene of Act I. In response to Onion 's question ? ' you are not Pageant Poet to the City of Millaine sir , are you ? ' ? Antonio says : I supply the place sir : when a worse can not be had sir . ' 1 Antonio further incriminates himself by coming out vigorously in favour of using stale , threadbare material . He tells Onion : I do use as much stale stuffe , though I say it my selfe , as any man does in that kind I am sure . ' Jonson mocks Munday succinctly but skillfully . Though Munday received ? 2 for his paines ' for the 1604 Lord Mayor 's Show for which guild records indicate that Ben Jonson was the apparent author of the entertainment , 2 it is the pageant of 1605 that is the first to survive in a printed text . This show , called The Triumphs of Re-United Britannia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new mayor , and it is unique in at least two respects . It contains the only full-scale treatment of the popular Brutus-in-Albion myth of English history to be found in civic pageantry down to the closing of the theatres . This pageant has the further distinction of having been readied twice for performance , but the scheduled day , 29 October , was the occasion of a storm which did much damage to the preparations ; thus upon request of the company , p. 69 ) ? which partially accounts for the total expense of ? 710 2s. 5d . Two payments to Munday indicate much about the diverse duties usually assumed by the dramatist : he was given ? 38 for providing apparel for all the children in the pageant , ship , lion , and camel , and for the chariot ' , and ? 6 more for printing the books of the speeches in the pageant and the other shows . . . ' ( MSC , pp. 68-9 ) . A Mr Hearne ' , a painter , received L75 for making , painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel , and new painting and furnishing the ship , and for the furniture for both giants ' ( p. 68 ) . Here we get a glimpse of the increasingly important role of the artificer in the total production of such pageants , a subject discussed more fully in a later chapter . Also of considerable // interest is the ? 10 paid to 88 porters for carrying the pageant , ship , and beasts ' . This suggests that the devices in a typical Lord Mayor 's Show were carried through the city rather than remaining stationary as was the common practice in the royal entry pageants . The pageant itself opens with what amounts to a prologue to the several scenes or dramatic vignettes that follow ; it is a conversation between the Master , Mate , and Boy of the ship called the Royall Exchange ' .3 Ostensibly they have just returned from a voyage where they have gathered rich spices and silks and are now struck by the tumult in London ; and the Boy says with an implicit pun on the name of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , / On such a generall mirthfull Holyday ? ' ( sig . A4v ) . Thus the Master orders that they disburse the goods aboard the ship so that they might adde the very uttermost . . . / To make this up a cheerefull Holi-day ' . This opening prologue with its embedded allusion to the guild is succeeded by a mute scene involving the appearance of Neptune and his Queen Amphitrita seated upon a lion and camel . They are present , Munday says , because they first seated their sonne Albion in this land ' ( sig . B1 ) . The dramatist explains further : . . . in them we figure Poetically , that as they then triumphed in their sonnes happy fortune , so now they can not chuse but do the like , seeing what happy successe hath thereon ensued , to renowne this Countrey from time to time ' ( B 1 ) . This dumb show ' prepares the way for the full dramatic treatment of Munday 's theme of the renewal of unity under the present king , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goemagot ( also present at the Temple Bar in the 1559 royal entry ) , appearing in the shape and proportion of huge Giants , for the more grace and beauty of the show ' ; they serve as guides to the main pageant device . The chief stage is a mount triangular ' which contains in the supreme place under the shape of a fayre and beautifull Nymph , Britania hir selfe ' ( sig . Bl ? Blom ) . Seated beneath her is Brutus , and thus this scene becomes the thematic and dramatic centre for the entertainment with Munday 's exploration of the Brutus myth . As we know , the pseudo-history of Brutus 's settling of England was an // important aspect of the Tudor myth ' or Tudor interpretation of history , and the Elizabethans took the story quite seriously with just cause since such historians and chroniclers as Matthew Paris , Richard Grafton , John Stow , William Camden , and Holinshed had perpetuated the legend . Many literary works alluded to the story ? one recalls the catalogue of British kings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book bight Briton Monuments ' at the House of Alma in canto x of Book II of Spenser 's Faerie Queene . The most obvious example from the drama of the time is the play , of disputed authorship , called The Lamentable Tragedie of Locrine ( c. 1595 ) . Locrine , of course , was Brutus 's eldest son , and the play rehearses the traditional story . Brutus 's decision to divide his kingdom among his three sons and the consequences of that act are the heart of the story ; similar situations are found in some of Brutus 's descendants , such as Lear and Gorboduc , also the subjects of dramatic works . The beginning of Munday 's 1605 text contains his effort to trace the history of Brutus back to Noah and the Flood ; in addition he sketches Brutus 's conquest of the island and the subsequent division of the kingdom among his sons . The speeches for this scene are delivered by the severall children , according to their degrees of seating in the Pageant ' ( sig . B2v ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albion but for the conquest of Brutus , who then responds by outlining the advantages that his conquest have brought : taming the wilderness , overcoming the giants in the land , and establishing Troynovant on the Thames . But Loegria , Cambria , and Albania , representing the three divisions of the kingdom , chide Brutus for his decision to sever the kingdom and they recount some of the consequences . To which Brutus responds with new hope that the separation of the land and the Weeping so many hundred yeeres of woes ' shall be no more ; his answer is tied to the present sovereign , James I : Albania , Scotland , where my sonne was Blaine And where my follies wretchednes began , Hath bred another Brute , that gives againe to Britaine her first name , he is the man On whose faire birth our elder wits did scan , Which Prophet-like seventh Henry did forsec , Of whose faire childe comes Britaines unitie . And what fierce war by no meanes could effect , To re-unite those sundred lands in one , The hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seat on Britiaines throne This second Brute , then whom there else was none . Wales , England , Scotland , severd first by me : To knit againe in blessed unity . ( sig . B3v ) This exposition of James 's claim to the throne and his reconciliation of the parts of the kingdom serve the dramatic theme of unity ; thus while the Tudors may take credit for uniting the warring houses , James and the Stuart line reunify the severed kingdoms . There had been a suggestion of this role of James in the speech by Zeal at Fleet street in the royal entry pageant of 15 March 1604 ( see Chapter Two ) . After Brutus sketches this new union , his three sons , Locrine , Camber , Albanact , represented in the pageant , speak in turn and submit their kingdoms to the unification of the whole . The new day is hailed and applauded , and the one personating Troynovant incites fair Thamesis , and the rivers that bounded the severed kingdoms , ( personated in faire and beautifull Nymphs ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our second Brute , Royall King James ' ( sig . B2 ) . So Thamesis , Severn , and Humber join in a universal song of praise of the sovereign . This scene ' thus closes , having sounded the essential theme of the entertainment , that the kingdom must remain physically and spiritually one ? a theme adumbrated throughout Shakespeare 's history plays . The next part of the entertainment celebrates the trade guild by presenting seven former kings ? Edward III , Richard II , Henry IV , Henry V , Henry VI , Edward IV , and Henry VII ? all connected in some way with the history of the company . They pass forth in a chariot which is preceded by Fame that attends on Britaines Monarchy , / Thus reunited to one state againe . . . ' ( sig . Cl ) . Each figure speaks in turn revealing his contribution to the company 's welfare . A vacant place is left in the chariot with the hope that James will eventually accept the freedom of the Merchant Taylors . Other pageant writers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor . The festivities close with the re-appearance of Neptune and Amphitrita , this time with speaking roles . Neptune praises the king who has set this wreath of Union ' on Britain 's head , Whose verie name did heavenlie comfort bring , / When in despaire our hopes lay drooping dead . . . ' ( sig . C2 ) . And Amphitrita suggests a graceful bridge between the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras : Our latest Phaenix whose dead cinders shine , In Angels spheres , she , like a mother milde , // yeelding to Nature , did her right resigne To times true heyre , her God-son , and lov'de childe , When giddy expectation was beguilde : And Scotland yeelded out of Teudors race , a true borne bud , to sit in Teudors place . ( sig . C3 ) These two characters thus echo the earlier theme and praise of James . In the final speech Neptune directs his attention to the mayor offering a challenge and moral instruction , suggesting that there will be a true holiday ' when Justice is dominant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poore is made , / Sloth set to labour , vice curbd every where . . . ' ( sig . C4 ) . Most of the elements of the pageant serve to re-inforce one another with the historical legend of Brutus and its application to James pro-viding the focus . Its significance is underscored by the stage properties ' ; the prominence of Britiain 's Mount with the attendant figures in appropriate costume . No other Lord Mayor 's Show is centred quite so thoroughly on a single historical legend , and it helps provide a unifying structure for the show even if it is flagrantly propagandistic . Historical and mythological figures alike posit the importance of the new unity of the island , assuming , as surely Shake-speare did , that without such cohesiveness discord and civil strife would erupt . Clearly here is an example of the pageant theatre of the streets exploring themes common to the public stage just as the opening tableau in the coronation pageant of 1559 had established a precedent through the tangible genealogical tree of the Tudors and the spoken verses celebrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability can Neptune 's instruction to the new mayor be of much value . To honour the mayor , Sir Thomas Campbell , Munday was en-gaged by the Ironmongers in 1609 to devise a pageant which he called Camp-bell or the Ironmongers Faire Field . Because unfortunately sheet A of the only extant text is missing , our knowledge of the entertainment is incomplete . Company records , however , provide considerable in-formation and supplement Munday 's pamphlet . We learn , for ex-ample , what was to have taken place on the river by the following entry : A Whale with a Blackamore in his Mouth with Musick and casting water out of his ffynnes , and fyer out of his mouth and rowed private A Mer Mayd coming his tresses in a looking glass with lady Thamesis couched on his ffynes and each of them their speeches . ' 4 THE LORD MAYORS ' SHOWS The Ironmongers ' set up supervisors to guide the necessary prepara-tions , all reminiscent of plans for other kinds of civic pageants , especially the royal entries . Munday , according to the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing apparel for the children and giving the company 500 bookes printed of the speeches . . . ' ( MSC , p. 73 ) . In early November shortly after the performance of the pageant Munday was called before the Ironmongers ' Court , and the following charges were made against him : that the children weare not instruc-ted their speeches which was a spetiall judgment of the consideration , then that the Musick and singinge weare wanting , the apparrell most of it old and borrowed , with other defects . . . ' ( MSC , p. 76 ) . There is no clearer example in civic pageantry of the discrepancy between the planning and the execution of a dramatic show , and one can only wonder how many times performances might have been faulty . Small surprise that Munday 's plea for an additional ? 5 was denied later in November by the company . Perhaps anticipating such trouble , Munday writes in his text : . . . our time for prepara-tion hath bene so short , as never was the like undertaken by any before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 5 He registers a further complaint about the weake voyces ' of the children which in a crowde of such noyse and uncivill turmoyle , are not any way able to be understood , neither their capacities to reach the full height of every intention , in so short a limitation for study , practise , and instruction ' . Such excuses fell on deaf ears within the sponsoring company , however ; it is interesting to learn that the guilds so zealously watched over the performances . Unifying the pageant itself is Munday 's allegorical presentation of the kingdom with the virtues that support it , a thematic motif present in a number of previous civic entertainments . Personifying the virtues necessary for a good government is at least as old as 1559 , when Elizabeth was greeted by the seat of worthy government ' situated at Cornhill and containing such virtues as Pure Religion , Love of Subjects , Wisdom , and Justice . Occupying Jonson 's tableau on the arch at Fenchurch in the 1604 royal entry were similar virtues supporting Monarchia Britannica . Munday 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Majesty holdeth her government . . . ' ( sig . B1 ) . It is richly garnished with all sorts of jewels , and in its midst is a golden field wherein is erected Majesty 's watchtower . Here an idealistic , golden world is created , and Munday // presumes upon the metaphorical relationship between this created microcosmic world and the real state . All of the allegorical figures in this device are emblematically costumed , following the general practice of the pageant writers . Majesty , for example , hath a costly vaile of golde Tinsell on her head , and thereupon her Crowne imperiall , a Mownd in her left hand , and a golden Scepter in her right ' ( sig . B1 ) . The figure of Religion is seated nearby ; she is dressed in pure white and holdes a rich Booke in one hand , and a silver rod in the other , as her Ensignes of good reward and encouragement ... ' ( B1 ) . Nobility and Policy also accompany Majesty , and Munday comments : These are not unapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( sig . Blom ) . On the lowest level of this arrangement are Memory , holding a Table Booke with a silver pen still ready to write ' , and Vigilancy , carrying a Bell and an houre Glasse . . . ' ( Bl ' ' ) . Seated behind Majesty is Tranquility , that ever blessed Companyon of all Royall Kingdomes . . . ' ( Blom ) , dressed in red and carrying a palm branch in one hand and a wreath of flowers in the other . The three Graces , already used by Peele in his 1591 Lord Mayor 's Show and by other dramatists , are also present with the allegorical virtues . Munday assigns to the Graces , Aglaia , Thalia , and Euphrosyne , the qualities of Cheerfulness , Peacefulness and Happiness . They were dressed , respectively , in crimson , willowe collour ' , and purple . Munday adds another dimension to their meaning : Euphrosyne sitteth in a golden Cave , holding a faire shield wherein Fame triumpheth over Death . The second Thalia holdes another Shield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Aglaia hath her Shield , wherein Tyme sits sleeping , his houre glasse layd along and not running , and his Scithe broken in two peeces ' ( sig . B2 ) . Having the Graces carry emblematic shields is a technique that Munday may have borrowed from Thomas Dekker , who in King James 's passage through London in 1604 , had placed the Graces , appropriately costumed , at the pageant at Soper-lane End holding in their handes pensild Shieldes ; upon the first was drawne a Rose : on the second , three Dyce : on the third a branch of Mirtle . Figuring Pleasantnesse . Accord . Florishing ' . For the pageant writer to borrow a basic device from someone else was not at all uncommon . Accompanying the mayor and offering interpretation are the figures of St. George , mounted on a dragon , and St. Andrew , seated on a unicorn ? ' united now in everlasting amitie ' . Should there be any doubt of the allegorical import of this pageant , St. Andrew 's // words make the meaning quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those seaven royall and unparalled Vertues , that are this lifes best glory , and the futures Crowne , do make it seeme a Feild of heavenly happiness ' ( sig . B3 ) . And he suggests that the seven virtues may foretell seaven gladsome and fayre nourishing yeares of comfort . . . . ' St. George offers an interpretation of the pageant also and concludes on this instructive note : But loyall hearts , spirits of courage , and hands inured to warre or peace , are the best walles about it the island , as defensive against invading Envie , or homebred trecherie , as offensive to any hot spleene of Malignitie ' ( sig . B3v ) . Thus the speakers make a moral application of what has been visually displayed , a technique as old as civic pageantry itself . Having in his 1605 show illustrated the need for union of the kingdom , Munday in 1609 presents a visual and verbal statement of the virtues that ought to surround any government with the allegory clearly pointing to the commonwealth of Stuart England . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records of the Merchant Taylors ' indicate that Munday was the author who along with the artificer Grinkin received over JJ200 for part of their services ( MSC , p. 79 ) . A boy was paid eight shillings for his representation of Merlin in the Rock ' , and that is about all we know of the nature of the pageant . Clearly it must have been an elaborate spectacle because the total cost exceeded ? 805 . Fortunately there is a text for the 1611 Lord Mayor 's Show which Munday wrote to honour Sir James Pemberton , Goldsmith ; he calls the show Chruso-thriambos . The Triumphes of Golde . The records of the company reveal that John Lowen , actor of the King 's Men , played the role of Leofstane in the pageant ; thus he joins Burbage , who in the previous year had performed in Munday 's show honouring Prince Henry , as a participant in civic pageantry . At such moments the line separating the regular stage from the street theatre is more diminished than usual . Lowen , himself a Goldsmith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should provide a horse and furniture for himselfe and the horse . . . ' ( MSC , p. 81 ) . Placing the emphasis again on history , Munday presents former Lord Mayors who were vital to the history of the company-one recalls Nelson 's use of William Walworth in the 1590 Lord Mayor 's Show . Though the familiar tableau device is used again , it is of secondary importance with the principal significance of the entertainment residing in the dramatic action ' . The new mayor is rather directly involved with this action , and Munday provides a semblance of plot , at least more than had been in his previous shows . // The river entertainment and the land pageant both allude to the Goldsmiths . In fact , boats ostensibly filled with ingots of gold and silver accompany the mayor on his journey on the Thames . An Indian king and queen , Chiorison and Tumanama , are also present , having brought into England . . . no meane quantity of Indian Gold . . . . ' 6 On land they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphal Chariot ' . Munday describes the nature of the main device : On a Quadrangle frame , of apt constructure , and answerable strength , we erect a Rocke or Mount of Golde , in such true proportion , as Art can best present it . . . ' ( sig . A4 ) . This mount contains various persons performing the tasks of mining and refining the metal , and near the top is Chthoon or Vesta , the breeding and teeming Mother of al Golde , Silver , Mineral , and other Mettals . . . ' ( sig . A4v ) . On her right hand sits her daughter Chursos ( Gold ) and on the left Argurion ( Silver ) linked to her Chaire of State with a Chaine of Gold . . . ' ( sig . Bl ) . Attending them are two beautifull Ladies ' , Antiquity and Memory . While this pageant clearly refers to the guild and its mythological heritage , no particular instructional purpose is served . But our interest is with the other figures and other activities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Baynard 's Castle by Leofstane , a Goldsmith , by whose person Munday means to portray Sir Henry Fitz-Alwin , the first Lord Mayor of London . After a speech of welcome , Leofstane leads the mayor to a tomb , and they see there also a chariot which contains figures representing Richard I and King John , both of whom were largely responsible for instituting and establishing the office of Lord Mayor . History has come , as it were , to lend its sanction to the activities of the day . The chief dramatic action occurs at the tomb where Leofstane encounters Time , a familiar figure in civic pageantry or in Shake-speare 's The Winter 's Tale , who develops a history of the Lord Mayors , especially those Goldsmiths who have served as mayor . Time asserts that he is the one who has brought Leofstane to this moment and asks : As thus I turne my Glasse to Times of old , So tune thine eares to what must now be told ' ( sig . B3 ) . He further reviews the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and John . Finally , Time reveals that in the tomb // lies one Nicholas Faringdon , four times Lord Mayor , and he calls him forth : Arise , arise I say , good Faringdon , / For in this triumph thou must needs make one ' ( sig . B3v ) . The resurrection ' is completed in this stage direction ' : Time striketh on the Tombe with his Silver wand , and then Faringdon ariseth ' ( B3v ) . Munday breaks down the notion of a still-life tableau with such action and thereby brings us further in the direction of a meaningful dramatic action . When Faringdon responds to the beckoning call of Time , he is clearly puzzled : Can not graves containe their dead , / Where long they have lien buried , / But to Triumphs , sports , and showes/ They must be raisd ? ' ( sig . B4 ) ; but Time explains what the occasion is and Faringdon is delighted : To heare the tale that Time hath told , / Since those reverend daies of old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the three figures move throughout the city , they address the new mayor , Leofstane giving a long explanation of the device of the Mount of Gold . Finally the entertainment closes with speeches that night at the mayor 's gate where Leofstane dwells on the meaning of Pemberton 's name , and Time asserts that such a goodly name , / Requires bright actions , from pollution free , / In word and deede to be alike . . . ' ( sig . C3v ) . But it is the newly arisen Faringdon speaking with the authority of one who has visited the land of the dead who closes the event with challenging and instructive words : You are a Gold-Smith , Golden be Your daily deedes of Charitie . Golden your hearing poore mens cases , Free from partiall bribes embraces . And let no rich or mighty man Injure the poore , if helpe you can . The World well wots , your former care Forbids ye now to pinch or spare , But to be liberal , francke , and free , And keepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from prodigality. ( sig . C4 ) In effect Faringdon urges the new mayor to follow Aristotle 's golden mean ( all the more appropriate since he is a Goldsmith ) . In a sense the pageant thus moves from the abstract to the concrete : from the misty regions of the Mount of Gold to representations of actual historical figures called forth by Time to the closing pointedly moral advice which applies concretely to the new mayor , James Pemberton . // In short , the allegorical method of giving the intangible idea con-crete form is at work . In 1612 Thomas Dekker was chosen as the one to prepare the Lord Mayor 's Show , and in 1613 , Thomas Middleton ( both dis-cussed in following chapters ) . But in 1614 Munday 's fellow Drapers called upon him to direct the pageant for the installation of Sir Thomas Hayes . The show , which Munday called Himatia-Poleos . The Triumphes of Olde Draperie , 7 does not differ markedly from his earlier pageants . Company records are scant and provide little supple-mentary material . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Rowland Bucket and offers praise to this exact and skilfull Painter . . . ' ( pp. 18-19 ) . This is the first time in one of his texts that Munday grants the artificer such recognition . A consider-able portion of the first part of the pamphlet is spent in apologizing for having been led astray by Stow to call Henry Fitz-Alwin ( Leofstane ) a Goldsmith in the 1611 show when he was in reality a Draper . Appropriately , then , Fitz-Alwin is again represented in the 1614 pageant honouring the Drapers . In addition to Fitz-Alwin Munday includes another former mayor , Sir John Norman , a mayor in the mid-fifteenth century and allegedly the first to go to Westminster by barge . Munday places him on the water in a boat with the seaven liberall Sciences ( all attired like graceful Ladies ) sitting about him . . . ' ( p. 8 ) . Norman greets the mayor with a speech and later assists in explaining the devices of the show . There is also a group of sweet singing youths , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' who sing a most sweet dittie of Rowe thy Boate Norman , and so seeme to rowe up along to Westminster , in honour of our Lord Maiors attendance ' ( p. 10 ) . These former mayors lend their blessing to the festivities and also remind the new mayor of some of his noble predecessors . Fitz-Alwin is situated with several other figures in a chariot , drawen by two golden pelletted Lyons , and two golden Woolves ' ( p. 6 ) . The person of Richard I is also represented ; he is surrounded by personified figures of several English cities . Those Citties are dis-ciphered by their Eschuchions of Armes , and that their best advantage ever ensued by making of woolen Cloathes , for the continuall main-tenance of Englands Draperie ' ( pp. 6-7 ) . Munday does not enumerate which cities are so represented except London , sitting neerest unto himselfe Richard , as chiefe Mother and matrone of them all ' ( p. 7 ) . London wears a triple crown of gold , under battelled or // branched with Cloudes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drapers Societie . . . ' ( p. 7 ) . It was not uncommon for the pageant writer to personify a city ? Peele in one of his shows presents London as does Middleton in his 1613 pageant . In his speech to the mayor Fitz-Alwin sets forth the illustrious past of the company . Munday also uses a mount which represents the whole estate of Londons olde Draperie ' . In the most eminent place sits Himatia , or Cloathing , as Mother , Lady and commaundresse of all the rest , who by their distinct emblemes and properties . . . doe expresse their dutie and attendance on so gratious a person . . . ' ( p. 7 ) . Several figures are shown industriously performing the various functions of preparing woollen clothes . Also Peace , Plentie , Liberalitie , Councell and Discreet Zeale , doe supporte the florishing condition of Himatiaes Commonwealth , and strive to prevent all occasions which may seeme sinister or hurtfull thereto ' ( pp. 7-8 ) . Unfortunately , Munday does not describe these allegorical personages , but we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final event a goodly Ramme or Golden Fleece ' appears with a Shepherd sitting by it , and the Shepherd addresses the mayor . The Golden Fleece was commonly associated with the Drapers ' Company , and Munday will develop the Jason-Golden Fleece story in suc-ceeding pageants . The closing speech of the entertainment gives the usual charge to the mayor to prepare for envies stormes ' and to practice vertue , zeale , and upright heed . . . ' ( p. 17 ) . On the whole the pageant is a rather feeble echo of Munday 's preceding show of 1611 , displaying little of its inherent dramatic interest . The Drapers succeeded again in 1615 in selecting the mayor , this time Sir John Jolles , and Munday was asked to devise the entertain-ment which he called Metropolis Coronata , The Triumphes of Ancient Drapery . History , moral allegory , and mythology all help shape the pageant . Again , company records yield little useful information . The presentation on the Thames is the most elaborate of any of Munday 's water shows to date . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason and his companions , Hercules , Telamon , Orpheus , Castor , Pollux , Calais , and Zethes . They are seated around him attired in faire guilt Armours , bearing triumphall Launces , wreathed about with Lawrell , Shields honoured with the Impresse of the Golden fleece , and their heads circled with Lawrell , according to the manner of all famous Conquerors ' .8 Much of the attention is directed to Medea , whose love to Jason , was his best meaner for obtaining the // Golden fleece ' ( sig . A3v-A4 ) . To illustrate the fiery zeale of her affection towards him , she sitteth playing with his love-lockes , and wantoning with him in all pleasing daliance . . . ' ( sig . A4 ) . The boat is rowed by divers comely Eunuches , which continually attended on Medea , and she favouring them but to passe under the fleece of Golde , had all their garments immediatly sprinkled over with golde . . . The second device on the river is another barge , this one in the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabethan progress pageants ) and containing the figures of Neptune and Thamesis . Not surprisingly , the redoubtable and seemingly ubiquitous Henry Fitz-Alwin is also represented in the boat . In fact , seated around him are eight royall Vertues ' bearing the ensignes ' of former Drapers who served as mayor . Crowded in also are the allegorical figures of Fame triumphing in the top , and Time guiding the way before ' ( sig . A4v ) . In a lengthy speech Fitz-Alwin salutes the mayor , offers interpretation of the water pageant and suggests a ' morall application ' of what is displayed : Tour Honour may make some relation Unto your selfe out of this stone , You are our Jason , Londons glorie , Now going to fetch that fleece of Fame , That ever must renowne your name . . . . No Monsters dare confront your way . ( sig . B1v ) The new mayor is to consider that all this faire and goodly Fleete ' do attend upon him and offer their services to him . By moral analogy he becomes linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association . The first device which greets the mayor on land after his return from Westminster is another ship , stiled by the Lord Maiors name , and called the Joell , appearing to bee lately returned , from trafficking Wool and Cloth with other remote Countryes . . . ' ( sig . B2 ? ) . Guiding the Chariot of Mans Life ' is Time , who , though not having a dramatic function as in 1611 , describes this chariot which contains a globe supported by the four Elements , emblematically costumed , and which runs on seven wheels describing the seven ages of man . . . ' ( sig . B4 ) . The chief pageant , which provided the name of the entertainment , is the Monument of London , which includes the figure of London , The ancient Mother of the whole Land ' , and her Twelve Daughters ? i.e. , the Twelve Companies of London . Raised about London as supports to Londons flourishing happinesse , // and continuance of the same in true tranquillitie ' are four goodly Mounts ' bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth truly happy ' ( B4 ) Learned Religion , Military Discipline , Navigation , and Homebred Husbandry . This may call to mind the figure of Majesty in the 1609 show and the virtues that surrounded her . It is also reminiscent of Middleton 's London 's Triumphant Mount from his 1613 mayoral pageant . Munday is again preoccupied with the well-being of the common-wealth and the virtues that are conducive to it . The festivities of the day concluded with the appearance of a figure from English pseudo-history , Robin Hood . He was accom-panied by a number of his men all clad in greene , with their Bowes , Arrowes and Bugles , and a new slaine Deere carried among them ' ( sig . B3 ) . At the close of the sixteenth century Munday had written two plays dealing with the subject of Robin Hood : The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon ( the latter written in collaboration with Henry Chettle ) . Munday suggests a reason , though historically inaccurate , for Robin Hood 's appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Fitz-Alwin.9 Robin Hood and his men talk and sing , and finally Robin Hood speaks to the new mayor : Since Graves may not their Dead containe , Nor in their peacefull sleeper remain , But Triumphes and great Showes must use them , And we unable to refuse them ; It joyes me that Earle Robert Hood , Fetcht from the Forrest of merrie Shirwood , With these my Yeomen tight and tall , Brave Huntsmen and good Archers all : Must in this joviall day partake , Prepared for your Honours sake . ( sig . Cl " ) The mayor has been duly welcomed by these figures out of the mythical past : Jason and Robin Hood , and Fitz-Alwin adds his voice as one representing former days ; it is thus appropriate that Time should also be present . But Munday fails to achieve much thematic unity here , there being little connection between the various // aspects of the pageant ; those pageants that make the greatest claim on our interest in them as drama convey a sense of integrity and wholeness ? missing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilful pageant-dramatists let instruction and compliment serve their artistic and dramatic purposes , thus rising above the simplest demands of civic drama , as Munday himself demonstrates in the following pageant . Munday continues his monopoly on the Lord Mayor 's Show again in 1616 when he prepared Chrysanaleia : The Golden Fishing to honour John Leman , Fishmonger . It is clearly one of his best productions with considerable thematic unity and a significant dramatic action . In December 1616 , Munday appeared before the court of the com-pany asking for an additional ? 10 in gratification ' for the two hun-dred extra books which he had and for some spoiling of the costumes , and the court decided that he shall have vii xvs gyven unto him which he is content thankfully to accept in full satisfaction of all his demaundes ' ( MSC , p. 91 ) . Considerable interest is added to this civic pageant by the magnificent contemporary drawings preserved by the Fishmongers ' company ? the most extensive set of such drawings for any Lord Mayor 's Show down to the closing of the theatres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal entry . These pictures confirm the rich visual spectacle described by Munday10 ( see plates 9 ? 12 ) . Honouring the company is the first device which is used both on water and on land ; it is appropriately a fishing boat called the ' Fish-mongers Esperanza , or Hope of London .... ' 11 ( See plate 10 . ) It may pass , Munday says , for the fishing Busse , wherein Saint Peter sate mending his Nets , when his best Master called him from that humble and lowly condition , and made him a Fisher of men ' ( sig . Blv ) . But if this be a bit far fetched , we may take the boat for one of the ordinary vessels that daily enricheth our kingdome with all variety of fish the Sea can yeelde . . . ' ( Blv ) . In the boat are a number of fishermen seriously at labour ' drawing in their nets filled with fish and bestowing them bountifully among the people ' . Continuing the allusion to the guild is the device of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( by nature ) to Musique ' , Arion rides on its back , himself having been saved so from death , when // Robbers and Pirates on the Seas , would maliciously have drowned him ' ( Blv ) . Arion and the dolphin had earlier appeared in an Elizabethan Lord Mayor 's Show and at the famous pageant at Kenilworth in 1575 . The next pageant contains an especiall Morality ' and has considerable symbolic interest . It presents a lemon tree ( pun on the mayor 's name ) in full and ample forme , richly laden with the fruite and flowers it beareth ' , and at its root a goodly Pellicane bath built her nest , with all her tender brood about her ' ( B2 ) ( see plate 11 ) . Fully aware of the traditional symbolic meanings of the pelican , Munday draws an analogy between it and the new mayor : An excellent type of government in a Magistrate , who , at his meere entrance into his yeares Office , becommeth a nursing father of the Family : which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hee must labour to bring up ' ( B2 ) . The mayor truly answers the emblematic meaning if his brest and bowels of true zeale and affection , are alwaies open , to feed and cherish them . . . . ' In short , the mayor is urged to exercise love and compassion in discharging his duties , the mute testament of this device . In addition , the Five Senses in their best and liveliest representations ' are present because the lemon tree is conducive to restoring and comforting man 's senses . The dramatic and thematic centre of the entertainment is contained in the device of a goodly Bower , shaped in forme of a flowrie Arbour ' which stands in St. Paul 's churchyard . Within this Bower is a Tomb whereon rests the figure of Sir William Walworth , twice Lord Mayor in the fourteenth century and also a participant in Nelson 's 1590 Lord Mayor 's Show ( see plate 9 ) . The whole conceit , Munday says , aimeth at that tempestuous and troublesome time of King Richard the Second ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion . The body of Walworth is attended by five knights who assisted him in protecting the king and defeating the rebels . London 's Genius , a comely Youth , attired in the shape of an Angell , with a golden Crowne on his head , golden Wings at his backe , bearing a golden Wand in his hand , sits mounted on Horsebacke by the Bower . . . ' ( sig . B3 ) . The arrival of the new mayor translates this tableau into action . The Genius speaks to Walworth : Thou Image of that worthy man . . . . Though yet thou sleep'st in shade of death ; / By me take power of life and breath ' ( sig . B4v ) . A note in the margin of the text describes the action : Here the Genius strikes on him with his wand , whereat he begins to stir , and comming off the Tombe , looks strangely about him . ' With this and the several blasts of trumpets Walworth is resur- // rected ' , all in the pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walworth takes note of his company 's history and the occasion that brings the present festivity . The legend of Walworth who manfully defended and preserved ' the crown epitomizes the celebration of the guild as in a dramatic revival he comes forth to lend his presence as a tangible reminder of the glorious heritage of the company . Munday continues his allusion to the Walworth story in the last device of the entertainment , a chariot drawne by two Mare-men , and two Mare-mayds . . . ' ( sig . B3 ? ) ( see plate 12 ) . In the highest place of eminence sits the triumphing Angell , who that day smote the enemy by Walworths hand , and laid all his proud presuming in the dust ' . With one hand the angel holds on the crown of King Richard , who is seated beneath her , that neither forraine Hostilitie , nor home-bred Trecherie should ever more shake it ' ; in the other hand she holds a striking rod , signifying : By mee Kings reigne , and their enemies are scattered ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is populated with Royall Virtues , as Truth , Vertue , Honor , Temperance , Fortitude , Zeale , Equity , Conscience , beating down Treason and Mutinie ' ( sigs . B3v-B4 ) . The moral ( and political ) conflict between virtue and vice is suggested by these allegorical characters , and the arrangement reminds us of similar tableaux in both the 1559 and 1604 royal entries in London . On the rear and sides of the chariot sit other personified virtues : Justice , Authority , Law , Vigilancy , Peace , Plenty , and Discipline , as best props and pillers to any Kingly estate ' ( sig . B4 ) . Munday adds that these figures are best observed by their severall Emblems and properties , borne by each one , and their adornments answerable to them in like manner ' . Here , as in other shows , Munday represents allegorically the virtues vital to a government 's welfare . By implication Walworth champions the cause of virtue in its struggle against political and moral vice . In the afternoon when the mayor returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Little Conduit in Cheapside , and there they are described and interpreted by Walworth who helps make explicit what has been symbolically implied . For example , he notes that the pelican speakes ingeniously/ The Character of your authoritie : / . . . fostring her brood : / Though with the deare expence of her owne blood ' ( sig . C3 ) . Referring to his own valorous deeds , Walworth says : I made them the rebels stand , / And , in my Soveraigns sight , there I strooke dead/ Their chiefest Captaine and commanding head ' ( sig . C3 ) . In similar fashion all the elements of the pageant are explicated . The festivities close with a graciously // poetic speech again by Walworth spoken at night which begins : Phoebus hath hid his golden head/ In Thetis lappe . And now are spred/ The sable Curtaines of the night , / Our Evenings purpose to delight ' ( sig . C4 ) . The metaphor of marriage is developed also , suggesting that this day marks the wedding of the mayor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May your Fame , / Crowne still their ancient worthie name/ To all posteritie ' ( C4 ) . Munday has adopted the structural movement from the abstract to the concrete again ? generally characteristic of his best efforts . He gains additional unity by having every element of the entertainment refer to the Fishmongers in some way . The examples of the fishing boat and Arion on a dolphin allude to the company and imply some-thing of the industry and dignity of the guild . Symbolizing the charity and compassion that ought to prevail is the lemon tree-pelican device . Through the dramatic resurrection of Walworth and the concluding chariot we gain a realistic , actual example of strength and courage that should be imitated . This glorious incident from the history of the company also carries ramifications regarding the pre-servation of the state , a constant thematic concern of Munday 's . Middleton won out in the competition for the 1617 show , but Dekker and Munday both received consolation prizes ' ; Munday got ? 5 for his paines in drawing a project for this busynes which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This illustrates the com-petitive nature of the Lord Mayor 's pageants . Nevertheless , in 1618 Munday devised the show for the Ironmongers ' honouring Sir Sebas-tian Harvey , and he named it Sidero-Thriambos or Steel and Iron Triumphing . The company records are rather generous with informa-tion concerning the preparations for the pageant and the dealings with Munday and his associates . Apparently all were pleased with the performance , for on 2 November we find this entry : In Con-sideracion of Anthony Mundyes good performance of his business undertaken and of spoyling of his Pageant apparaile by the foule weather it was agreed to give him three powndes as a free guift of the Companie besides and above the Contract ' ( MSC , p. 96 ) . John Grinkin , familiar for his participation in the production of earlier pageants , is included among those who assisted with the show . So is Munday 's son , Richard , 12 and the distinguished career of Gerard Christmas as artificer has its beginning here ( discussed in a later chapter ) . The total cost of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of 1617 cost over ? 882 . There is an interesting historical // footnote to this pageant : Sir Walter Raleigh 's execution was placed on the same day as the Lord Mayor 's Show Aubrey says , so that the pageants and fine shewes might drawe away the people from behold-ing the tragoedie of the gallants worthies that ever England bred ' ( MSC , p. xlii ) a certain testimony to the popularity of these street entertainments . In keeping with the company that is being honoured , Munday constructs for the first device an island which has on it a mine . Therein Mulciber , the God of 114-ynes and Mettals . . . sheweth his personall attendance , with divers of his one-eyed Cyclops about him . ' 13 These figures are actively engaged in the various mining processes . At the four corners of the isle are four beautifull Nymphes or Graces ' named Chrusos , Argurion , Calcos and Sideros , figuring the foure ages of the world , and habited according to their true Carrac-ters and natures ' ( sig . Blv ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronze Age each formerly held sway , they have now given way to the Iron Age , which Munday says parenthetically is the age wherein wee live ' . It is interesting to speculate that perhaps Munday was influenced by Thomas Heywood 's series of plays on the four ages of the world which were written between 1611 and 1613 . Jupiter is also present on the island , mounted upon his Royall Eagle , with his three-forked Thunderbolt in his hand . . . ' ( sig . B2 ) ? a description that corresponds with Jupiter 's appearance in Shakespeare 's Cymbe-line . In the pageant he wears a suit of armour that had originally been intended for Mars but is given to him by Mulciber because hee so graciously vouchsafed , to bee personally present in this Triumph , as Patron of all their pains , and protector from foule-mouthed slander and detraction ' ( sig . B2 ) . The presence of Jupiter , the highest of the gods , is a personal compliment to the mayor . Furthermore , he em-bodies the allegorical concept of Protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Cannon located near the mine celebrates the achievements of the Ironmongers ' . An ancient British Bard guides the way to the Mount of Fame , the second principal device of the show . Obviously in the most eminent place on this mount is the allegorical figure of Fame , seeming as if shee sounded her Golden Trumpet , the Banner whereof , is plenti-fully powdred with Tongues , Eyes and Eares : implying , that all tongues should be silent , all eyes and cares wide open , when Fame filleth the world with her sacred memories ' ( B4 ) . Fame shows the mayor the other personages which accompany her for more honour-able solemnity of this generall Triumph ; presaging a happy and // successefull course to his yeare of government ' ( sig . B4 ) . Munday is drawing on a long and extensive use of Fame in the civic pageantry before this show . Here Fame stands as a reminder that the leaders of state must perpetuate the noble heritage from which they have come , for Fame with her eyes and tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of the magistrate . The figure of Expectation sits below Fame on the right and suggests that there will be more then ordinary matter expecte from him . . . ' ( B4v ) . Hope sits on the other side , and reminds the mayor that his father had also once been mayor and left such sensible instructions to his Sonne , as can not but edge his temper the more keenely , and quicken his spirits the more industriously ' ( sig . B4v ) . Justice and Fortitude are also present , treading down the figures of Ambition , Treason , and Hostility , which seeke the subversion of all estates . . . ' ( sig . Cl ) . And to assist the mayor in his struggles against these vices , they sit gyved , and manacled together in Iron shackles , purposely made and sent from the Ironmongers Myne , to binde such base villaines to their better behaviour ' ( sig . C 1 ) . Munday thereby connects the two main devices of the show . There is a final group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sober Sisters ' , Fear and Modesty , are present , both vailed , but so sharpe-sighted , that they can discerne through the darkest obscurities , when any disorder threatneth danger to Majesty , or to his carefull Deputie ' ( sig . C1-C1v ) . Should the two become aware of any danger , they inform Vigilancy and Providence , who sit close by . These in turn awake Care to ring the Bell in the Watch-Tower ' , which in turn calls forth Courage and Counsel , that every one may have imploiment , for safe preserving the Mount of Fame ' ( sig . C1v ) . These Virtues will readily aid the mayor as he faces the sundry trials of his office . The allegorical message to the magistrate is unmistakable : he must summon forth these different virtues to bear him up in the unstinting conflict with vice . In deliberately archaic style the Bard addresses the new mayor in the afternoon as he goes to St. Paul 's , and he holds out this hope : Honor , Heale and Happinesse , / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C3 ) . Similarly at night the Bard gives his parting ' to the mayor : That Justice , Zeale and Payetie , / Mayne shine in yee with Mejesty , / That he wha puts yee in thilke trust , / Mey finde yer rule sa true and just . . . ' ( C3v ) . Missing in this pageant is the sense of action contained in the previous show of 1616 ; instead the allegorical tableau is the chief means of expressing the themes with the Bard 's speeches being set pieces rather than action punctuating the still-life scene . // One of Munday 's comments in this pamphlet is worth attention , for in it he sets forth a veritable ars poetica for the pageant-dramatist . He writes : For better understanding the true morality of this devise , the personages have all Emblemes and Properties in their hands , and so neere them , that the weakest capacity may take knowledge of them ; which course in such solemne Triumphes hath alwaies beene allowed of best observation . . . ' ( sig . Clv ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art creating a tableau vivant , and the visual element is essential . There is little time for dramatic develop-ment , and yet the allegory must be understood readily : hence the emblematic method . At times it is as if some of these figures in civic pageants have merely stepped from the pages of the popular emblem books , a subject discussed fully in a later chapter . Munday 's last contribution to civic pageantry came in 1623 in the form of the water show performed on the Thames in honour of the mayor , but Middleton was responsible for the rest of the enter-tainment . Munday called his part The Triumphs of the Golden Fleece . What he essentially does is to reach back into the file and pull out the same device which he had used in the 1615 show . Again we find a boat with Jason , Medea , and others in it , most of them carrying shields bearing the impress of the Golden Fleece , and for this boat Munday received L35 , according to company records . Munday adds : Wee suppose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Triumphall day , by the rare Arte of Medea the Enchan-tresse. . . . ' 14 In this performance Medea is attended by six tribu-tary Indian kings , holding their severall dominions of Medea , and living in vassalage to her ' ( sig . A4v ) . They row the boat , wearing their Tributarie Crownes , and Antickely attired in rich habili-ments ' . Munday continues to be fascinated by the Jason-Golden Fleece story ; and on a more practical level , it has a direct relationship to the Drapers ' Company , of which he himself was a member . Through Munday 's involvement with the Jacobean Lord Mayor 's Show we learn more about the details of their planning and prepara-tions ; especially do we learn of the pageant-dramatist 's duties , ranging from being responsible for the children 's breakfasts to pro-viding apparel to having the books printed to planning the speeches and action of the entertainment . We also begin to learn something of the role and responsibilities of the artificers , a crucial development that is discussed in Part Three of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor 's Show . // One of Munday 's important contributions to the mayoral pageantry is his concentrated use of history . He alone explored the Brutus myth of English history and gave it dramatic life in London 's streets . Building upon the precedent of Nelson 's 1590 show , Munday constantly relies on the presence of former Lord Mayors in his pageants ; indeed he brings to these pageants a historical sense of continuity . His resurrection ' scenes in the 1611 and 1616 shows are unique in pageantry and suggest a kinship to the regular theatre in which a number of plays contained such events The Winter 's Tale to name a famous example . By including such action Munday helps move the Lord Mayor 's Show even further in the direction of drama , and we shall see other dramatists taking their inspiration from Munday 's efforts at producing dramatic as well as thematic interest . At times his civic drama achieves a sophisticated level in the use of allegory and symbolism , an art that he obviously understands well . Skilful also is his use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be forgiven his propagandistic excesses especially in the 1605 show and somewhat in the 1616 one , for such is very much a part of civic drama which seeks to venerate the noble past while celebrating the present . Thematically he insists on the necessity of the unity of the kingdom , a motif implicit in most of his productions . There is a strong corollary to this theme : a representation of the virtues necessary to preserve the sanctity of the commonwealth , a theme sounded in other civic pageants of other times as well . Allegory is his chief method for presenting that particular theme as the abstract concept takes on flesh . A brief reflection on history plays of Renaissance drama will suggest another kinship that Munday 's pageants share with the regular stage . What is alive and viable in the streets may have similar vitality in the Globe . 162 6 Thomas Dekker Writing near the beginning of the text of his first Lord Mayor 's Show , Thomas Dekker offers a statement which captures some of the traditional feelings about civic pageants : Tryumphes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Peace and Abundance ; Love begets them ; and Much Cost brings them forth . Expectation feeds upon them , but seldome to a surfeite , for when she is most full , her longing wants something to be satisfied . So inticing a shape they carry , that Princes themselves take pleasure to behold them ; they with delight ; common people with admiration . ' Dekker underscores the civic ' nature of these pageants , their ex-pense , and the political atmosphere that gives them impetus peace and abundance . The relative stability and increasing wealth of the late Tudor and early Stuart period certainly played a major role in the blossoming of the civic drama of the streets . Dekker also testifies to the intensity of man 's desire for such entertainment , and by 1612 when he penned the statement , he could not lack for evidence . By the time Dekker wrote his first Lord Mayor 's Show , he had already made a major contribution to English civic pageantry with his portion of the 1604 royal entry entertainment for King James ( discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the challenges , demands , and limitations placed on a pageant-dramatist . It is not surprising , therefore , to find him in-volved with mayoral pageantry . Also , his play The Shoemakers ' Holiday illustrates his knowledge of and interest in former mayors of London . The 1612 entertainment comes in the period of highest achievement of the Jacobean Lord Mayor 's Show ? the second decade of the seventeenth century , and Dekker 's pageant is an excellent example // of the level of achievement in that period . His remaining mayoral entertainments 1627 , 1628 , 1629 ( there are texts only for the last two ) , of course come at the beginning of the reign of Charles I and afford us an opportunity for comparison ; we shall notice that there are no real innovations or major changes in the form or content of Dekker 's Caroline shows . Dekker 's most significant contribution to mayoral pageantry is doubtless his effort to impose on the somewhat nebulous form of the show a morality play structure : not just the usual concern with moral theme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict between virtue and vice a significant , dramatized tension , not a merely visual statement . Whether it is a conscious effort to imitate the medieval morality play is of course indeterminate . But much of Dekker 's drama reflects at least an indebtedness to morality drama in terms of his interest in and use of allegorical figures . Old Fortunatus ( 1599 ) is a good example , for here Dekker freely mixes allegorical and realistic characters . Indeed , Fortune , complete with her wheel , enters in the first scene of the play , and she remains throughout as one of the principal characters in the drama . By Act I , scene iii , Vice and Virtue , appropriately costumed , begin their struggle to win the allegiance of those involved in the action of the play . In true morality drama fashion they vie for the soul of Andelocia in IV.i. ; Virtue reminds him : The path that leades to Vertues court is narrow , Thornie and Up a hill , a bitter jorney , / But being gon through , you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. 200-10 ) . Ultimately , as we might expect , Virtue is triumphant , and the action of the play closes with a hymn to Virtue 's honour . In his The Whore of Babylon ( 1607 ) , Dekker presents the figures Time , Truth , and Plain-Dealing , among others . In fact , much of the play may be regarded as a historical allegory , for Dekker says in the Lectori ' to the play : The Generall scope of this Dramaticall Poem , is set forth ( in Tropicall and shadowed collours ) the Greatnes , Magnanimity , Constancy , Clemency , and other the incomparable Heroical vertues of our late Queene ' ( II , p. 497 ) . As noted in an earlier discussion , the opening dumb show of this play parallels the confrontation between Time , Truth , and Elizabeth during the 1559 royal entry pageant . With such a background it is no wonder , then , that Dekker turned to this allegorical technique in his mayoral pageants . To honour Sir John Swinnerton , Merchant Taylor , Dekker wrote his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite elaborate affair with a total expenditure of L978. 12s. 11d. , one of the more expensive mayoral pageants of the seventeenth century . Part of the ela- // borateness of the show is doubtless because of the anticipated pre-sence of both Prince Henry and Frederick , Count Palatine , future husband of Elizabeth , the daughter of James I and Anne . According to the company records Dekker and a Mr Hemynges were paid ? 197 for the devise of the Land shewes , being a Sea-Chariott , drawne by two sea-horses , one Pageant called Neptunes Throne , with the seven liberall sciences , One Castle called Envies castle , One other Pageant called vertues Throne , and for the printing of the bookes of the Speeches , and for the persons , and apparell , of those that went in them . . . : 2 In his text Dekker complains about the tradition of porters who typically carried the devices through the city ; referring to the fish ' on which the tritons ride in front of Neptune 's chariot , Dekker says : they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloath , and browne paper , but are living beasts , so queintly disguised like the natural fishes , of purpose to avoyd the trouble and pestering of Porters , who with much noyse and little comlinesse are every yeare most unnecessarily imployed ' ( II , p. 233 ) . Thus certain changes in production techniques are taking place . In the pageant Dekker exercises excellent dramatic control of his material , given the inherent limitations of the civic drama form ; there is a distinguishable dramatic movement as well as the usual thematic concern . We witness a dramatic confrontation between the forces of good and evil , and it is given theatrical tension , not just tableau representation . The show is carefully orchestrated as the dramatist builds to a dramatic climax when the power of virtue is triumphant . Allegorically we have something which resembles the movement of medieval morality drama from sin to salvation . Like Munday , Dekker offers us a coherent dramatic action , not merely theatrical spectacle . On the south side of St. Paul 's the first land pageant awaits the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea chariot in which the principal figure is Neptune , his head circled with a Coronet of silver Scollup-shels ' , and in his hand he holds a silver Trident , or Three-forked-Mace . . . ' ( III , p. 232 ) . Sitting at Neptune 's foot is Luna ( the Moon ) , governesse of the sea ' ; she holds the reins of the horses in her hands . Other sea figures are in the chariot or go before it . When the mayor arrives , Neptune greets him with a speech of welcome in which he initially professes to be puzzled about the occasion of such noise and acclamation , but he soon realizes that it is in the mayor 's honour that all these Rites are done ' ( p. 233 ) . But the welcoming speech does not conclude with these rather // traditional words ; instead , Neptune offers a moral interpretation , obviously setting the stage for the morality action that follows . Neptune bids the mayor : Goe therefore on , goe boldly : thou must saile In rough Seas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps befriend thee : But ( how blacke So ere the Skyes looke ) dread not Thou a Wracke , For when Integrity and Innocence sit Steering the Helme , no Rocke the Ship can split . ( pp. 233 ? 4 ) In this metaphorical journey the mayor is of course the pilot , who , Neptune adds , if he is sound/ To himselfe ( in Conscience ) nere can run-a-ground ' ( p. 234 ) . Even a mythological character fulfils a moral ' function for Dekker as Neptune prepares the way for the rough seas ' . The morality drama ' is advanced another step with the second device which is the Throne of Virtue where in the most eminent place sits Virtue , her temples shining with a Diadem of starres , to shew that her Descent is onely from heaven : her roabes are rich , her mantle white ( figuring Innocency ) and powdred with starres of gold , as an Embleme that she puts upon Men , the garments of eternity ' ( p. 235 ) . Even as Moses lifted up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exalted , ready to draw all men unto her . Accompanying Virtue are the Seven Liberal Sciences because they are ready guides to Virtue ; they wear loose robes for Knowledge should be free ' , and Every one carrying in her hand , a Symbole , or Badge of that Learning which she professeth ' ( p. 235 ) . This Throne , which is a chariot , is pulled by four horses on which are mounted Time , Mercury , Desire , and Industry , all costumed according to their usual iconographical representation . With this presentation of Virtue and her retinue Dekker is preparing for the actual confrontation between this force of good and the force of evil , Envy . And thus it is instructive to look back to Dekker 's contribution to the royal entry of 1604 and see inherent there this conflict between Virtue and Envy . In the most prominent place on the arch at Fleet street Dekker had placed Justice , who incidentally appears as the final speaker in the 1612 Lord Mayor 's Show . Directly under Justice was Virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ' ( II , p. 295 ) . Also included in the tableau arrangement was Envy , unhandsomely attirde all in blacke , her haire of the same colour , filletted about with snakes ' ; she stood in a darke and obscure place by her selfe , neere unto Vertue , but making shew of // a fearefulnesse to approach her and the light . . . ' ( p. 295 ) . This static grouping implies the ancient conflict between Virtue and Envy ; and in the Lord Mayor 's pageant Dekker has , as it were , taken that earlier idea , breathed life into it and transformed it into a dynamic and dramatic presentation , a presentation that is both verbal and visual . This example emphasizes the interconnections between various forms of civic pageantry , especially the royal entry and the mayoral pageants , and the idea of a homogeneous dramatic development in the street is given new evidence . When the mayor approaches her throne , Virtue salutes him as one of her own and gives him much moral and political advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute ' , and should Set Plenty at thy Table , at thy Gate/ Bounty , and Hospitality . . . ' ( p. 237 ) . When storms come , the mayor must Shelter with spred armes , the poor'st Citizen ' . In his ministrations he need not feare the Stings of Envy , nor the Threates/ Of her invenomd Arrowes , which at the Seates/ Of those Who Best Rule , evermore are shot . . . . ' This image of Envy is explicitly developed in the next scene ' ; thus Dekker skilfully offers links between the various segments of the pageant . Under the sheltering wing of Virtue , the mayor is taken to face the struggle of vice and virtue for his allegiance . The abstract conflict between Virtue and Envy is given concrete reality in the next device , the action at which represents a type of dramatic climax ' for the whole pageant . Near the Little Conduit in Cheapside was placed the Forlorne Castle where on the battlements appeared Envy as chiefe Commandresse of that infernall Place . . ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boon companions ? Ignorance , Sloth , Disdain , Oppression . Enlarging somewhat on the 1604 portrait of Envy , Dekker describes the present figure : her selfe being attired like a Fury , her haire full of Snakes , her countenance pallid , meagre and leane , her body naked , in her hand a knot of Snakes , crawling and writhen about her arme ' ( p. 238 ) . She thus counters in a striking way the appealing presentation of Virtue . Envy 's troops are armed with arrows to shoot at Virtue ( making literal the metaphor used by Virtue in her previous speech to the mayor ) , and Riot and Calumny , the giants , stand at the gates of the castle to block Virtue 's passage . But overcoming the obstacles Virtue onely holding up her bright shield , dazzles them , and confounds them , they all on a sudden shrinking in their heads , untill the Chariot be past . . . ' ( p. 238 ) . This dazzling brightness of Virtue recalls a statement made by Virtue to Vice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foole , / To fight with me , I suffred you awhile , / // T'ecclips my brightnes , but I now will shine , / And make you sweare your beautie 's base to mine ' ( V. ii . 298-301 ) . The bright shield of Virtue might also remind us of Arthur 's brilliant shield in Spenser 's Faerie Queene , especially effective in his battle with Orgoglio in Book I. In Dekker 's pageant the evil forces shoot their arrows into the air where they burst into fireworks as having no power to do wrong to so sacred a Deity as Vertue ' . Envy 's speech is frenzied as she tries to rally her forces : Stop , stay her , fright her , with your shreekes , / And put fresh bloud in Envies cheekes ' ( p. 239 ) . But such panic is countered by Virtue 's words of assurance : On , on , the beames of Vertue , are so bright , / They dazle Envy : On , the Hag 's put to flight . ' Hanging close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , through the jawes of Envy and all her Monsters ' ( p. 240 ) . Dekker says : And this concludes this Triumphant assault of Envy : her conquest is to come ' ( p. 239 ) . The climax of the drama has been reached , but not the complete resolution . Having survived the encounter with vice , the mayor is brought to the Cross in Cheapside where the fourth device is stationed ; it is the House of Fame , functioning as a sort of house of Holiness ' in terms of the thematic development of the pageant . In the upper seat of this House sits Fame crowned in rich attire , a Trumpet in her hand , &c.'; ( p. 240 ) . Dekker seems to assume that we know the common properties of Fame ; indeed , she has been represented in a number of civic pageants including the portrayal of Fame on the Soper-lane arch in the 1604 entertainment where Dekker gives a full description : A Woman in a Watchet Roabe , thickly set with open Eyes , and Tongues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trumpet in her hand , a Mantle of sundry cullours traversing her body : all these Ensignes desplaying but the propertie of her swiftnesse , and aptnesse to disperse Rumors . ( II , p. 276 ) Accompanying Fame in her house are several kings , princes , and noblemen who have been free of the Merchant Taylors ; they are alluded to in Fame 's speech . Also , A perticular roome being reserved for one that represents the person of Henry the now Prince of Wales . ' A room is set aside for Henry because some five years earlier he had accepted the freedom of the guild , but also the gesture is essentially one of praise for the eighteen year old prince who was already carving out his niche in the House of Fame . Unfortunately Henry could not be present to accept the adulations ? he was deathly ill . In fact , on 6 November , a few short days after the pageant , he was // dead , and Dekker 's placing him in the household of Fame seems almost prophetic . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the House of Fame.3 When the mayor arrives , he is welcomed to Fames high Temple ' and is bid : here fix fast/ Thy footing ; for the wayes which thou hast past/ Will be forgot and worne out . . . ' ( p. 240 ) . If he would be successful in his duties , he should gird himself in Virtue 's influence which is like strong armour ; Fame asserts : She Virtue guides thee , Follow her . In this Court of Fame/ None else but Vertue can enrole thy Name . ' The mayor is also asked to gain instruction from the examples of the worthy people who fill Fame 's Voluminous booke ' . Fame closes her speech by echoing the moral theme of the pageant : . . . win then that prise/ Which Vertue holds up for thee , And ( that done ) / Fame shall the end crowne , as she hath begun ' ( p. 242 ) . The mayor has now been shown the path to salvation . A song that concludes this scene underscores the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall Swinerton nere dye , But his vertues upward flye And still spring Whilst we sing In a Chorus ceasing never , He is living , living ever . ( p. 244 ) This fourth scene , which offers the dramatic resolution ' , is com-pleted when the entourage returns to St. Paul 's after the ceremonies at the Guildhall . Virtue and Envy are locked in battle again , Envy still desperately trying to rally her troops . But Virtue knows that the Hag'sput to flight ' ( p. 245 ) . The forces of Envy are completely routed when the virtuous characters discharge their pistols at the evil ones . The conquest has now come . As the day closes and the civic drama ends , the figure of Justice stands before the mayor 's gate to bid him farewell . It is altogether appropriate that Justice should speak after Virtue has sealed her victory over Envy justice having been done . Justice promises to sit beside the mayor 's gate for the duration of his term To guid thee In and Out : thou shalt commit/ ( If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ' ( p. 245 ) . She knows the mayor is secure , Yet men ( like great ships ) being in storms , most neere/ To danger , when up their sailes they // beare . ' He is urged to be impartial in his dealings with the citizens , rich and poor alike , and he is reminded : Thy Conscience must be like that Scarlet Dye ; One fowle spot staines it All : and the quicke Eye Of this prying world , will make that spot thy scorn . ( p. 246 ) He should use the golden collar of his office to knit/ Mens hearts in Love . . . . " Knowing the Mathes of Others that are gone ' should offer him knowledge , teaching him what to do . Finally Justice hopes that the mayor May be as old in Goodnesse as in Yeares ' ( p. 246 ) . The mayor is thus ready to take his place in the real world , having been nurtured through the moral conflict of the day and having been strengthened by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be evident now , the structure of this pageant closely resembles the dramatic development of a typical medieval morality play , following the comic pattern from encounter with evil to victory . No mayoral pageant up to 1612 is so structured , though Munday clearly moves in that direction . Nor does any other one so closely involve the participation of the mayor ; he is no mere spectator here there is an active struggle for his allegiance . It all adds up to good theatre with dramatic unity being achieved despite the obstacles . Its thematic unity is impressive too , and some of the links between the scenes ' have been noted . From the outset , as if preparing for the subsequent action , Neptune warned the mayor that he will sail in rough seas of rule , and the conflict between Virtue and Envy demonstrates just how rough that voyage can be . Fortunately , and not surprisingly , Virtue is triumphant in the climactic battle with Envy and thus may bring the mayor into the sanctity of Fame 's house where we catch something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the mayor must descend from the rarefied atmosphere of the House of Fame back into the mundane world , and here Justice stands by his gate ever-ready to aid and strengthen him . She will guide him , thus assuring his salvation , as he is buffeted about in the storm-tossed seas of government . Like Everyman , the mayor may be secure in the knowledge that he has gained and his Good Deeds may follow him to the grave , validating the words of the song in Fame 's temple ? He is living , living ever ' . Unfortunately , this high point of achievement of 1612 was not duplicated in Dekker 's other mayoral pageants , those written in the early years of Charles 's reign . For one thing , the dramatist abandons the morality structure that offered such unity in favour of the more traditional pattern of mayoral shows ? the staging of rather loosely // connected tableaux . No other pageant-dramatist affords us a glimpse at the possible development in two different historical periods : Munday is exclusively Jacobean ( in terms of extant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception the 1626 pageant ? also wholly Jacobean ; while Heywood , the last major pageant-dramatist , is exclusively Caroline . Whether one wants to classify the Dekker of the late 1620s as decadent ' or not , there is less satisfaction with his pageant efforts of that period . Perhaps he was merely afflicted with the all but inevitable sameness ' that was bound to occur in any such dramatic form . According to Dekker 's own testimony in his Wars , Wars , Wars ( 1628 ) , he was the author of the 1627 mayoral entertainment , but there is no surviving text . In 1628 , however , the Skinners ' used Dekker 's pageant , Britannia 's Honor , to celebrate the inauguration of Sir Richard Deane . For his services Dekker received x ' 23 , and Gerard Christmas , the artificer , got ? 150 , with total expenses exceeding ? 700 . Though the morality drama structure is missing in the show , it is not deficient in performing its didactic function . The first device , located appropriately on the Thames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas and Neptune 's wife . The use of Amphitrite is , in a way , a logical sequence to the 1612 show , which opened with the appearance of Neptune . In the 1628 show she sits on an artificial rock habited to her State ; a Mantle frindg 'd with silver crossing her Body : Her hayre long , and dishevelled ; on her head , a phantasticke dressing made out of a Fishes writhen shell , interwoven with Pearle . . . ' ( IV , p. 83 ) . Surrounding her are mermaids swimming in the water and figures representing the Trent , Humber , and Severn rivers . The presence of Amphitrite may be in partial debt to Munday 's The Triumphes of Re-United Britannia , the 1605 Lord Mayor 's Show , in which both Neptune and Amphitrite have significant roles , especially at the end of the pageant . For Dekker Amphitrite 's function is to offer a speech of welcome and praise , though she promises to make Smooth way Before you the mayor , on This Glassy Floore , / Ushering your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A speech in French was prepared to deliver to the queen should she be in attendance . Recapturing something of the title of the first mayoral pageant , Dekker calls the first device on land New Troyes Tree of Honor ; and the chief figure is London with an ornament of Steeples , Towers , and Turrets on her head . . . ' ( p. 86 ) . Further , in her left hand she holds a golden Truncheon . . . to chew that shees a Leader and Conductresse of a Mighty People : Her Right Hand ( thrusting through the // Arbor ) takes hold of a Tree , out of which spread Twelve Maine and Goodly Branches ' , symbolizing the twelve major guilds of London ( p. 86 ) . In many respects this representation of London parallels her appearance in other civic pageants , especially Middleton 's 1613 show . Accompanying London in Dekker 's pageant are Minerva and Bellona , Heereby intimating , that both Artes and Armes , are ( in a high degree and fulnesse of honor , ) nurc 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ' ( p. 86 ) . Placed around the Tree of Honour are certain allegorical figures , emblematically presented , who help bring glory and strength to the city . Peace has a dove on her fist and a palm branch in her hand , not unlike the depiction of her in Dekker 's contribution to the 1604 royal entry . Present also is Religion in a white glittering roabe , with a Coronet of Starres on her head , holding in one hand , a Booke open , in the other , a golden ladder , ( embleme of prayer , by whose steppes wee climbe to Heaven ) ' ( p. 87 ) . Other figures include Civil Government in a robe full of eyes , Justice with her sword , Learning with a book , Industry with a golden hammer and a compass , and Honour dressed in scarlet . In her speech to the mayor , London refers to herself as the mayor 's second Mother ' . She bids him take note of her Tree of Honour and guard its boughs . While his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember at the same Gate stands/ The Poore , with crying Papers in their hands . . . ' ( p. 88 ) . He is to Kisse Peace ' and let Order ever steere the Helme . . . . ' The speech closes with London 's metaphorical instruction : Tou are your Soveraignes Gardner for one yeare , The Plot of Ground , y'are trusted with , lies here , ( A Citty , ) and your care must all bee spent , To prune and dresse the Tree of Government . Lop off Disorders , Factions , Mutiny . . . . ( p. 88 ) The sea metaphor of Neptune in the 1612 show has been transformed into a correspondence between the body politic and the garden , certainly familiar to us from Shakespeare 's Richard II which this passage closely echoes . Whether the mayor be viewed as pilot or gardener , the message is the same : to him is entrusted the care and nurture of government , and positive action must be taken to insure the integrity of the state against disruptive forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fame who compliments the guild and addresses the mayor , but her meager role here contrasts sharply with her dramatically significant function in the // 1612 pageant . Such a contrast is a telling measure of the qualitative difference between these two civic dramas . Complementing the earlier appearance of London is Britannia in another device , ' Majestically attirde , fitting to her Greatnesse ' ( p. 91 ) . She occupies the most eminent seat in her Watch-Tower with eight silver columns , pendents , and two angels standing on pillars . In addition , the Capitals and Bases of the Pillars are Gold , and are Emblemes of the two Houses of Yorke and Lancaster : once divided , but now Joyned into One Glorious Building , to Support this Royal Kingdom , and Consequently This Citty . ' This historical allusion recurs several times in civic pageantry from the 1559 royal entry to Dekker 's incidental reference . Just a few years earlier , in 1624 , John Webster had also dealt with this theme in his Lord Mayor 's Show , Monuments of Honor . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tudors is a viable theme in civic drama . Britannia herself had been a significant part of Munday 's 1605 entertainment noted above , in which she engaged in dialogue with Brutus , mythical settler of England . This may be further evidence that Dekker was familiar with Munday 's pageant . Britannia is for Dekker surrounded by Magnanimity , with a drawne Sword ' , a Shipwright , Victory with a Palme Tree ' , and Providence , with a Trumpet , ready to Foresee Dangers , and awaken Men to meete them ' ( p. 91 ) . These figures are included because they are , Dekker says , Watch-Towers , and Lanthornes , in the Nights of Feare and Trouble , to Guard the Kingdome , and in the Kingdome , This Citty ' ( p. 92 ) . The Watch-Tower also contains representations of several former English kings who had in some way been associated with the office of mayor of London . Because Amphitrite , London , and Fame had already spoken , Britannia feels that she can not remain silent . Like London before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mothers Counsell . . . ' ( p. 93 ) . She invokes the sea metaphor : You are Come/ Aboard a Goodly Ship . . . / . . . High Admirall/ You are to All That Fleete , which Thus you Call/ To sayle in This vast Ocean ' ( p. 93 ) ; and , Your Owne Hands steere the Helme , But Strongly Steere , / And spite of stormes , be stoute when you stand There . ' The mayor is bid to use his sword to Kill , and Keepe/ Vices ( like Slaves ) in Awe . . . . ' The call to be admiral of the ship of state involves the recognition that he must be stern and resolute in the never ceasing war against vice . Finally , Britannia implores him to read a Lesson of my love ' and so be led by love through the perilous journey . London 's plea that the mayor be a faithful Gardener of the realm is now joined by Britannia 's hope that he will be a wise Pilot . // The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbour in which the Sunne sits , with golden Beames about his Face ; an Attire glittering like gold ; and a mantle bright as his garment , fringed with gold , his haire curled and yellow ' ( p. 93 ) . Around him are placed persons representing the four seasons , in proper Habiliments ' ( p. 94 ) . Beneath them is a wilderness in which are many sorts of such Beasts , whose rich Skinnes serve for Furres . . . . ' Perhaps the idea of using the Sun and the Seasons was suggested to Dekker by his earlier masque-like play , The Sun 's Darling ( 1624 ) . Raybright , the sun 's darling , has rejected the opportunities offered by each season and instead has fallen prey to Folly and Humour . In the closing moment of the drama Sun appears and points out the play 's allegorical mean-ing , especially how man should disdain vice and follow the virtuous pattern of nature that will give him health and youth . In the pageant Sun addresses the mayor and reports on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disorders of all sorts , that Hellish brood of Warres . . . ' ( p. 94 ) . Peace is found only in England , the blessed land That seest fires kindling round , and yet canst stand/ Unburnt for all their flames . . . . ' Implicit is the message to the mayor : preserve the peace that graces the land ? the instruction of London and Britannia should help on that score . Though dramatic action in this pageant is slight , there is a certain logical development in what takes place . One might call it cosmic ' development ; that is , the movement from sea ( Amphitrite ) to land ( London and Britannia ) to sky ( Sun ) , from microcosm to macro-cosm , for the Sun views the whole universe and from his unique vantage point perceives the peace and order that reign in England . There is a strong emphasis here , unlike the 1612 show , on the prob-lems of the commonwealth and the necessity for preserving its unity ? a theme shared with many other pageant writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest is minimal . When the Ironmongers sought to honour the mayor , Sir James Campbell , in 1629 , Dekker was again chosen to prepare the enter-tainment which he called London 's Tempe . Of special interest for the 1629 show are the eye-witness account and drawings by Abram Booth , secretary to the delegation of the Netherlands East India Company who had come to London to try to settle the differences between his company and the English East India Company of which the new mayor was a member.4 Booth 's small sketches of six devices are reproduced in the Malone Society , Collections V , plates I ? VI , and THOMAS DEKKER with the drawings for Munday 's 1616 pageant they constitute the only visual records we have of Lord Mayor 's Shows from 1558 to the closing of the theatres . As with his previous pageants , this one also opens with a seafigure , this time Oceanus , who provides the initial welcome on the river . He sits Triumphantly in the Vast ( but Queint ) shell of a silver Scollup , Reyning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 103 ) . He wears a diadem on his head and bears a golden trident in his right hand . Could he summon all the rivers of the world , Oceanus tells the mayor , they would weepe out there eyes , / Madde that new Troys high towers on tiptoe rize/ To hit Heavens Roofe . . . ' ( p. 104 ) . Further , That minion of the world/ Venice to Neptune , ? A Poore Lantscip is , / To these full Braveries of Thamesis ' ( p. 105 ) . This praise of London over the festivity-filled city of Venice had also been sounded a few years earlier in John Webster 's 1624 Lord Mayor 's Show . A Proud-swelling Sea ' constitutes the second device , and riding upon its waves is a sea lion on whose back is Tethys , wife to Oceanus , for why should the King of waves be in such a glorious progresse without his Queene , or she without him ? ' ( p. 105 ) . The two devices on the river are also brought to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostrich cut out of timber to the life , biting a horse-shoe ' . But Dekker fails to exploit these situations for any dramatic or thematic possibilities . Because the show honours the Ironmongers ' , the fourth scene presents a Lemnian Forge with Vulcan and his servants , the Cyclops . A fire is seene in the Forge , Bellowes blowing , some filing , some at other workes . . . . As the Smiths are at worke , they sing in praise of Iron . . . ' ( p. 106 ) . Cupid and Jove are also present near the forge . Cupid has on his head a curld yellow haire ' , wings at his back , and he bears a bow and quiver ? ' Golden and silver arrowes , are ever and anon reached up to him , which bee shootes upward into the aire , and is still supplied with more from the Forge ' ( p. 107 ) . In an appropriate exalted position sits Jove in a rich Antique habite , a long white reverend hayre on his head , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand burning ' ( pp. 107-8 ) . The tableau is given additional vitality by the conversation between Vulcan and Jove . In fact , Jove interrupts the work of the ironsmiths to speak of the contribution that iron makes to the lives of all . He also asks the workers to fashion thunderbolts for his use , For Vices ( mountain-like ) in black heapes rize , / My sinewes crack to fell them . . . ' ( p. 108 ) . Idiot pride , Ambition , Avarice , War ? ' Shall not Jove , beate downe such Impieties ? ' And Jove asks further : // Ist not high time , Ist not true justice then ( Vulcan ) for thee , and thy tough Hammer-men To beate thy Anvile , ? and blow fires to flames To burne these Broodes , who kill even with their Names ? ( p. 108 ) To which Vulcan affirmatively replies : Yes , Jove , t is more then Time . ' Jove closes the exchange with a lengthy speech that notes the value of iron both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fares : / But that Iron Plough shares , all the labour beares/ In Earth 's strange Midwry ? ' ? and morally : ' By irons strong Charms/ Ryots lye bound : ? Warre stops her rough Allarmes ' ( p. 109 ) . Clearly iron is vital in the pursuit of both peace and plenty ; and in addition to celebrating the company , this scene recalls the constant struggle against vice . It is possible that Dekker took some of his inspiration for the presentation of Vulcan and Jove from Munday 's Sidero-thriambos , the 1618 mayoral show , also designed to honour the Ironmongers ' . As we recall , the first device was an island called Lemnos that contained a mine where Mulciber and his Cyclops worked . They fashion products out of iron to the continual fall of their hammers in sweet Musicall voyces ' . Present also is Jupiter with his three-forked thunderbolt ' made for him by Mulciber . Such close parallels suggest indebtedness rather than coincidence . The fifth device gives the pageant its name , London 's Tempe , or The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campebell the new mayor , or Le Beu Champe , A faire and glorious field ' ( p. 109 ) . It is designed as an arbour , round about furnished with trees and flowers : the upper part with severall fruites : Intimating that as London is the best-stored Garden in the Kingdome for Plants , Herbes , Flowers , Rootes , and such like ; So , on this day it is the most glorious Citty in the Christian world ' ( p. 110 ) . Again it seems possible that Dekker glanced back to Munday 's pageant , particularly his 1609 show , Camp-bell or The Ironmongers Faire Field , written to honour Thomas Campbell , father of the 1629 mayor , James Campbell . Munday 's garden , containing Majesty 's Watch-Tower , was quite opulent with trees and fruit of pure gold . And St. Andrew at the close of the show suggested that the virtues that populate the garden do make it seeme a Feild of heavenly happines ' . Dekker 's tableau thus seems to strain continuity to the point of duplication . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker , but he is accompanied by Flora , Ceres , Pomona , Spring , and Summer .

And since Honors Zodiac is your sphaere , / A shrub to you must be the tallest Pine , / On Poore and rich you Equally must shine . ' Titan also indicates that the mythological figures that accompany him bring appropriate gifts to the mayor , recalling similar incidents in some of the progress pageants . The final presentation is Apollo 's Palace because seven persons representing the seven liberall Sciences are richly Inthroned in this Citty ' ( p. 111 ) . The persons are dressed in loose robes and hold in their hands Escutcheons , with Emblemes in them proper to every one quality ' . This representation parallels Dekker 's treatment of the Liberal Sciences in the 1612 Lord Mayor 's Show . The structure is supported by twelve silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported by four gold columns . Of course , Apollo is the chiefe person ; on his head a garland of bayes ; In his hand a Lute ' . This is the traditional emblematic representation of Apollo such as is seen in John Squire 's The Tryumphs of Peace , the 1620 mayoral pageant , where Apollo is shown at the top of Mount Parnassus sitting under a laurel tree playing his harp . In his address to the mayor in Dekker 's show Apollo takes notice of the festive scene and the happiness of the citizens and bids the mayor to Go on in your full glories ; whilst Apollo , and these Mistresses of the Learned Sciences , waft you to that Honourable shore , whither Time bids you hasten to arrive ' ( p. 112 ) . With the full blessing of Apollo and the Liberal Sciences , the mayor finally at night arrives at his own gate where he is bade farewell by Oceanus who wishes : Peace therefore Guard your bedds : / In your yeares Zodiacke may you fairely move , / Shin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 112 ) . It is a type of benediction . Between the speeches of Oceanus that open and close the entertainment , the mayor has repeatedly been made conscious of his guild , has been welcomed to his new post , and has received instruction . And Jove reminds us that the struggle between the forces of good and evil continues , and the active support of the company is sought in behalf of virtue . But on the whole the show suffers from its lack of unity , either thematic or dramatic ; scenes tend to be vaguely strung together with little pursuit of the dramatic possibilities . Even thematically , there is no coherent , cohesive theme that binds together the disparate parts . And the obvious reliance on some of Munday 's pageants suggests less than full creative imagination brought to the task . Perhaps the pageants of 1628 and 1629 should be viewed as Dekker 's dotages ' . Rich in spectacle they may be , but the dramatic soul ' is almost non-existent . Weighed in the balances with the 1612 entertainment , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // bode well for the mayoral pageants of the Caroline period . Dekker in his late shows completely ignores the genuine contribution he had made ; namely , the morality play structure of the 1612 show . If we had but that Jacobean pageant , we would have to regard Dekker as a successful pageant-dramatist , for he solved the problem of achieving dramatic unity while maintaining a consistent thematic purpose . Doubtless the 1612 show inspired the efforts of Thomas Middleton in his pageant of 1613 . We should not stretch Dekker out any longer on this tough rack of comparison , except to say that by the late 1620s his dramatic control was gone , or perhaps his creative interest and energy were no longer stirred by such civic occasions . Regardless , his career in mayoralty pageantry leaves us with a sad spectacle . 178 7 Thomas Middleton By the second decade of the seventeenth century Thomas Middleton was already well-established as a comic dramatist with such achievements as A Trick to Catch the Old One , Michaelmas Term , and A Chaste Maid in Cheapside behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urban life of London for their inspiration . We have noted earlier , in Chapter Two , his brief excursions into the civic pageant form : the speech of Zeal at the Fleet street arch in James 's 1604 royal entry entertainment and Civitatis Amor ( 1616 ) written to celebrate the creation of Charles as Prince of Wales . But from 1613 to his death Middleton becomes intimately involved with the production of mayoral pageants , writing a total of seven , a number equalled by Thomas Heywood in the 1630s , and surpassed only by Anthony Munday. l By 1620 he becomes the official Chronologer for the City of London , thus insuring his close connection with the affairs of the city . Toward the end of his dramatic career ( and his life ) Middleton produced his two best-known tragedies : Women Beware Women and with Rowley The Changeling . All the while he was also writing civic pageants , reminding us again of the inherently close relationship between the street theatre and the regular stage when the same dramatists are writing for both . Like Dekker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was his finest and his most elaborate with a total cost of some x ' 1,300-the most expensive mayoral pageant of the Renaissance . The planning and preparations for the entertainment which Middleton called The Triumphs of Truth are revealed in the records of the Grocers ' company whose member also named Thomas Middleton was elected mayor . Interestingly , Anthony Munday whom Middleton disparages in his text received L149 for the devyse of the Pageant and other shewes , and for the appareling and fynding of all the // ( 1933 ) , 65-78 . Bald finds little to praise in Middleton 's pageants. 179
