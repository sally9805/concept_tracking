They have been dubbed " the invisible Government " or " the hidden power elite " or " the shadow lawmakers . " <P> Yet , although they are nameless and faceless figures to the public , the more than 13,000 people who staff the committees and offices of members of Congress are neither malign nor inconspicuous . Many of them can be seen standing behind the rail at the rear of the House , and slipping in formation to Senators on the floor of the other chamber . <P> They often seem to dominate congressional hearings as they lean forward to supply legislators with shrewd questions that befuddle a committee opponent , or dazzling answers that sew up an argument . Their rising influence and expertise are among the reasons for the resurgent role of the U.S. Congress . <P> When the first streamlining of the confused and outdated federal criminal code reaches the Senate for action this week , public credit will go to its major supporters : the late Senator John McClellan , Senator Edward Kennedy and Attorney General Griffin Bell . Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in New York who spent ten months working full time on the highly complex bill as chief counsel of a judiciary subcommittee headed by Kennedy . Feinberg , 31 , labored with equally dutiful McClellan aides to bridge the gulf between liberals and conservatives on ways , for example , to get federal judges to sentence criminals convicted of comparable offenses to roughly equal prison terms . Similarly John Kramer , 40 , special counsel of the House Agriculture Committee and a law professor at Georgetown University , can claim credit for passage of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 . Unlike most aides , he speaks openly of his influence , saying : " It came through 99% the way I wanted it to . " <P> Other staff members are more reticent because their bosses properly insist on the public applause . Yet it was largely because of the prodding of Richard Perle , 36 , an aide for eight years to Senator Henry ( Scoop ) Jackson , that the Senate has adopted a key " qualification " to the 1972 U.S.-So-viet SALT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any future pact . Jackson has staked out defense matters as a main interest , and Perle 's hawkish skepticism about arms control and his mastery of intricate weaponry arguments have given him as much influence as many Administration officials in the arms infighting . <P> Most staff members are under 40 , well educated , well paid ( many are at the $40,000 level ) , and reflect the political leanings of their employers . Their power has grown out of the desire of Congress to compete with the previously overwhelming expertise of the vast bureaucracy of the Executive Branch . Also , legislative issues have grown more complex , and Congress has taken its watchdog function over the Administration more seriously . No Congressman can hope to absorb by himself most of the increasingly technical information demanded by both the expanded work of Congress and a more insistent and sophisticated public .
