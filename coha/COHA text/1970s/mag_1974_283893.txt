Jukeboxes have filled American honky-tonks , malt shops and ears for decades , inspiring songs ( " Put an-other nickel in , in the nick-el-o-de-on " ) , and even a modest treasury of jokes ( Sample : Two Martians sidle up to a glittering jukebox in a saloon and purr , " What 's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ? " ) . The pop-music beat goes on , but the coin-operated phonograph business is winding down . Last week Chicago 's Wurlitzer Co. , which has sold 650,000 jukeboxes in the U.S. since 1933 , announced that it will stop manufacturing them next month . <P> Young people apparently prefer carrying portable radios and cassette recorders to dropping 25 into the slot for two plays on a Wurlitzer . " There 's a changing life-style in America , " laments Wurlitzer Vice President Ago Koerv . " Instead of the soda fountain and local hamburger joint , we have McDonald 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken- organizations that do n't want to encourage people to hang around .
