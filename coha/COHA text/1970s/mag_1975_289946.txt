YOU 'RE NOT WELCOME , COMRADE , read the headline in the London Daily Mail . Just in case the visitor failed to get the message , the paper repeated it in Russian : Mbl BAC HE XOTHM , TOBAPHIU.The comrade was Politburo Member Alexander Shelepin , whose 48-hour visit to Britain last week mortified the Labor government , embarrassed the trade unions , and stirred unexpectedly deep reserves of anti-Communist feeling among the British public . <P> The outcry actually began last February when news leaked out that Shelepin would head a Soviet delegation invited by Britain 's Trades Union Congress . The Kremlin could scarcely have chosen a less suitable delegate . Shelepin is not only head of the impotent trade union organization in the Soviet Union-where strikes are illegal and workers are notoriously without genuine representation-but is also a former chief of the KGB , the dreaded Soviet secret police , which he ran from 1958 to 1961 . Declared Frank Chapple , head of Britain 's electrical and plumbing union : " The only experience Shelepin has of workers is putting them in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T.U.C. General Secretary Len Murray refused to rescind the invitation . To keep potential demonstrators off balance , the T.U.C. would not disclose when Shelepin 's Aeroflot jet would arrive or where he would go . Worried that the Soviet labor leader might be attacked or even assassinated , security agents later dispatched a stand-in resembling the short , heavy-set Russian in a decoy Daimler limousine . He took the brunt of a barrage of umbrellas , milk cartons , bricks and Passover cookies , as the real Shelepin slipped into T.U.C. headquarters through the tradesmen 's entrance . <P> Fearful of possible rioting , T.U.C. officials whisked their controversial guest to Scotland . During a tour of Kilmarnock , Shelepin fleetingly made contact with a real , live British auto worker , producing a less-than-historic exchange . " Is your lunch hour long enough ? " inquired the Russian through an interpreter . " It 's all right , " the worker replied . <P> Shelepin hastily summoned reporters to Prestwick Airport as he prepared to leave . He claimed that the demonstrations against him " did not reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He blamed the protests on the Jews . Contending that the U.S.S.R. had fought World War II for the sake of Jews , he charged that they are now " ungrateful enemies of dtente . " In fact , most demonstrators were Protestant Britons or Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian refugees . <P> Although actively in pursuit of dtente , Britain was discomfited by Shelepin 's presence , even though he is widely regarded as a contender for Leonid Brezhnev 's job when the Soviet party chief retires . As for the T.U.C. , it defended the bungled visit in a statement claiming that the trip had led to " constructive conversations held in a friendly atmosphere . "
