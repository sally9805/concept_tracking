The fondest hope of many a Warren Court critic has been that the Burger Court would overturn the 1966 Miranda decision . That momentous piece of " strict construction " requires police to inform suspects of their rights to silence , to a lawyer-and to free counsel if they are indigent ; it also bars the use in court of any statement obtained without a reminder of those rights . But instead of reversing Miranda outright , the new majority has opted for trimming , undercutting or blunting its reach . <P> In recent years the court has held that an improperly obtained confession can be used to attack the credibility of a defendant who takes the stand to deny his guilt . It has also upheld a defendant 's guilty plea , even though he did not know that the confession he had given was inadmissible at a full trial . Last week the court nibbled at Miranda again . <P> Accused Rapist Thomas W. Tucker had been told of his rights to silence and counsel-but not that he could have a court-appointed lawyer if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miranda decision . His trial came afterward , and none of his statements at the time of arrest were introduced . But damaging evidence came from a witness who , Tucker had told his police questioners , was a friend who would corroborate his alibi . Tucker 's attorneys argued that the name of the witness had been obtained as the " fruit " of the improper interrogation and so should be barred . <P> Speaking for the majority , Justice William Rehnquist declared that the law " can not realistically require that policemen investigating serious crimes make no errors whatsoever . " Barring Tucker 's statements at the trial was a sufficient response to the police failure to tell him he could have a free lawyer . The testimony of Tucker 's friend , Rehnquist concluded , could properly be used because it served the trial purpose of discovering the pertinent facts . Moreover , banning the testimony was not likely to deter similar police misconduct in the future , since the police misconduct in this case preceded Miranda . <P> In dissent , William Douglas protested that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a weighing of competing interests . He pointed out that each of the Miranda warnings had been held " fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege " against selfincrimination . The present court may not be willing to declare itself openly hostile to Miranda , but it clearly no longer considers the prescribed warnings as rock-hard fundamentals of American justice .
