WASHINGTON Correspondent Bonnie Angela has covered politicians and other public people on six continents for 16 years , but the last place she expected to be the other day was in a Bayonne , N.J. , brassiere factory . When Eleanor McGovern chose that unlikely spot to hustle votes for Husband George , Angelo and other reporters were on hand . Politics has obviously changed since the genteel kaffeeklatsch campaigning that most political wives used to practice , and the jet-paced public styles of Pat Nixon and Eleanor McGovern are at the heart of this week 's cover story . <P> Angelo , who did the principal reporting on both women , has also written about the activities of most of Washington 's prominent politicians , including the men behind Pat and Eleanor . She began following Mrs. McGovern down the political trail during the Democratic primaries last spring . Last week , amidst a hectic schedule of campaign visits to youth groups , senior citizens , day-care centers and factories , the two sat down again for a private chat in the McGovern hotel suite in White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite subject of Angelo stories since the 1968 campaign . <P> Angelo has accompanied the often inaccessible First Lady on a variety of jaunts , from Idaho Falls , Idaho , to Africa 's Ivory Coast . <P> Last week Angelo was back in the press section of the presidential jet for a stretch of hard campaigning that within two days encountered gale winds in Montana , a sleet storm in Wyoming , and heat of 102 F. in Southern California . " First Ladies , " says Angelo , " are no longer treated as perishable commodities . " <P> If following one campaign is demanding , keeping track of two can border on masochism . Missed meals , misplaced luggage and late nights become part of a political reporter 's life-style in an election year . Solitary confinement , however , was not part of <P> the course until one day recently when Angelo , accompanying Mrs. Nixon 's party , found herself locked in a hotel room in Yellowstone Park . With no phone , no response to her shouts and the press bus about to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Feeling like the prisoner of Zenda , I opened the window , forced the screen and jumped out . The room , happily , was on the first floor . " <P> Angelo 's reporting from the road went to Associate Editor Jonathan Larsen , who wrote the story . For Larsen , who recently served as our Saigon bureau chief , writing about the feminine side of presidential politics offered an interesting contrast . " In Viet Nam , " he says , " the wives of some politicians are their husbands ' silent business partners , and often you hear about them only when a scandal breaks . Here they have become vocal members of the team and must go on display for public approval . The American wives have it tougher . "
