Notes and Comment N American politics in recent years , there has been an important change in the way things happen . Until the last few decades , government action was ordinarily taken in accordance with visible , established procedures : first an action would be proposed in public , then a decision to take action would be made , and then the action would he taken . Today , in broad areas of the nation 's political life the sequence has been drastically altered . In the new sequence , first an action is taken , then it is revealed ( perhaps by an enterprising newspaper reporter ) , and , finally , the public is asked whether it wants the action to continue or to be stopped . This method of deciding things gives a great advantage , of course , to the executive branch of the government , since it shifts the weight of inertia , which is usually associated with inaction , to the side of continued action . In a modern bureaucratic state , it turns out to he much harder to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from starting in the first place , and there are many activities that few people would dare initiate but many people will accept once they are happening . Among these , it seems , are the abuses that have lately been uncovered in the intelligence agencies . And now , with the publication of the report on those abuses by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities , the nation 's belated moment of decision about what these agencies should be doing has arrived . Senator Walter Mondale summed up the situation the other day by saying , " In the past , Congress has been able to excuse its lack of vigilance on the grounds that it did n't know what has been going onl . Now it does . And if we know it and do n't do anything about it , then we 're really saying ' O.K. , let ' er rip . ' " If the recent vote of the Senate Rules Committee against setting up a permanent committee to oversee the agencies is any indication , it seems that the decision will he to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.I.A . man , speaking of the C.I.A . ' s power and Congress 's weakness , said to a reporter from the Washington Post , " We 've won too much . " In these circumstances , there is every reason to believe that the abuses of the last forty years will continue for the next forty years . We ca n't help feeling , however , that some changes would occur if the nation were making its decisions the way it is supposed to under the Constitution  --  that is , if someone in politics were to propose the actions that are likely to take place , rather than wait for something to happen and then see whether or not it can he stopped . Accordingly , drawing entirely on the public record of what the intelligence agencies have already done , and including as quotations only things that intelligence agents have actually said , we have set down a few words representing what such a proposal , if it were to be made by one of the Presidential candidates , might look like : Ladies and gentlemen : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the surveillance of ordinary Americans . At this very moment , there are , in my opinion , some million and a half Americans who should be watched . Therefore , if I become your President , I shall recommend , first of all , that the prohibition against spying by the C.I.A . within the United States he lifted . In addition , I shall recommend that the F.B.I . establish a General Name Index , which will contain the names of , say , one-half million of the most dangerous Americans , and that the Internal Revenue Service establish a second list of one-half million . This second list will be especially important , since the Internal Revenue Service will he empowered not only to investigate citizens but to punish them through use of their tax returns . At the moment , the F.B.I . is supposed to investigate only those incidents which may involve the breaking of a law . I shall recommend that this requirement he dropped . But , most important of all , I shall recommend that the F.B.I . establish a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rounded up in the event that I declare a national emergency , and that this include any journalists , writers , or political activists whose views are , in the opinion of the Director of the F.B.I. , questionable . Norman Mailer is an example of the sort of person I have in mind . In order that all this activity may go forward smoothly , no means of communication can be privileged . Letters must he subject to opening by the authorities ; all phone conversations must be subject- to wiretapping ; and all telegrams must be subject to government inspection . When these methods fail to bring results , I shall recommend break-ins into homes and offices . What can not be learned from letter-opening , wiretapping , the government interception of telegrams , and break-ins I will attempt to discover through informants . I propose a budget of seven and a half million dollars for the hiring of political informants , which is twice what we will he spending to hire informants on organized crime . It would he unfair , of course , if any American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lists of those to be investigated will not stop with radicals  --  or " dissidents , " as they say in the agencies  --  but will include church groups , news organizations , publishing houses , businesses , universities , and voluntary associations of every kind , such as women 's groups . The government will be keeping a close eye on the activities of all these . Among individuals , the late Eleanor Roosevelt , Supreme Court justice William 0 . Douglas , and Senator Adlai Stevenson III typify the sort of people we must spy on vigilantly . Nor will those in government have any special dispensation . The agencies will keep me as closely informed about what is going on in our own government as about what is going on in foreign governments . Every bureau and department in the government will be penetrated by informants . Ours is a tripartite system of government , and the two other branches will also he carefully watched over . I will gather information on Justices of the Supreme Court through electronic surveillance ; I will keep a watch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only will I investigate the staff of my rival in the next election but I will place taps on the phones of the opposition in my own party at its next Convention . The White House itself will he under the eye of the police , and no conversation that goes on there will be unavailable to my ear . In fact , in the whole of America there will he no conversation , whether it is on the phone or in person , no letter , and no telegram that is not available to your government . 1 . Ve may not intercept every communication , yet there will he no communication that is outside our power to intercept . Even I myself may be watched over , in the event that I decide to place myself under surveillance with a tape recorder . But universal access to information is not enough . Intervention will he required . The agencies must not be merely passive ; they must take an active , dynamic role . To be sure , simple wiretapping and other such procedures will serve an aggressive pm-pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are under surveillance , more careful of what they say . When the phone of one member of Congress is known to have been tapped , all members of Congress will fear that their phones are tapped . When one Supreme Court Justice is known to be under surveillance , all the Supreme Court Justices , as well as all the other judges in the country , will be on notice that they can be placed under surveillance , too . When a few informers have penetrated each of the nation 's most important institutions , then everyone in those institutions will he shadowed with the suspicion that be may he an informer . These procedures alone will , in the words of an F.B.I . man who has been advising me on the New Left , " enhance the paranoia endemic in these circles " and " get the point across that there is an F.B.I . agent behind every mailbox . " Under my Administration , paranoia will he cured by making the delusions true : I guarantee that I personally will stand behind every mailbox . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures a big program of positive action is required . Domestic clandestine propaganda will be one important tool . One of the great problems of our day is the public 's mistrust of government The government can evade this mistrust by publishing hooks and articles surreptitiously  --  get its points across by borrowing the good name of sources that are still trusted . ? Vhen my men have written or sponsored a book , they will review it , too  --  in the tradition of President Nixon , who wrote himself letters of congratulation after giving his televised speeches . Still more important , I propose a program of disruption . It will he the policy of my Administration to break up the marriages of political dissidents , by writing anonymous obscene letters to their spouses . In the case of groups that may he inclined to violence , I propose that the government incite them to attack one another , by sending inflammatory letters to one group in the name of another . " Shootings , beatings , and a high degree of unrest " are what my advisers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them all the assistance I can . It will be standard procedure , of course , to disrupt the plans of anyone planning to demonstrate against my policies . In confronting a threat on the order of the civil-rights movement , all these methods will he combined : the press will he fed embarrassing details of people 's lives or misinformation concerning them , and the full arsenal of wiretaps , break-ins , informers , and so on will be brought to bear . In such cases , moreover , I shall recommend that the government try to get individuals to commit suicide by threatening to release information about their persona Eves which was gained through electronic surveillance . Agents will not themselves commit crimes of violence in my Administration . That would be going too far . Only paid informers will be permitted to carry out beatings , plan bombings , and the like . In this way , the proper balance will he struck between law enforcement and lawbreaking . One final word . As President , I expect to make full use of the whole range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not plan strict oversight of the intelligence agencies . The chain of command must be loose . The agencies must he given lati rude to act on their own whenever and wherever they see a need . Things will therefore occur that I have not proposed here . In intelligence circles , the phrase " the need to know " is often used . But I shall he sensitive also to the well-known need not to know . For in those circles some matters arise which are so secret that even he who takes the action will never find out what the action was . ? ? New Hall WONDERS will never cease , but they sometimes take a while to come into being . The American Museum of Natural History 's new **28;5256;TOOLONG Hall of Minerals and Gems , which will open next week , with a display of over six thousand specimens , stems from the part-time sorting out a hundred years ago by Louis P. Gratacap of a modest assortment of mineralogical items stored hig gledy-piggledy in the Central Park Arsenal . Mr. Gratacap then a twenty-five-year-old chemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for minerals , and volunteered his services after hours ; the museum , whose building was not to open for another year , had borrowed working and exhibit space in the two upper stories of the Arsenal . Gratacap eventually became the full-time head of the museum 's mineralogy department , and for nearly forty years he built up the department 's collection . He liked labels and diagrams , but he detested oral public instruction . " To teach ... a sort of wandering caravan of stragglers and the odds and ends of the streets , hustling through the halls , is to me a dreary and repulsive business , " he once wrote the president of the museum ; and we realized the other morning , as we made a pre-opening tour of the hall , that there has been an improvement in educational conditions on Central Park West . The hall contained such public-instruction features as two sunken mini-amphitheatres , with adequate seating in each for a hundred schoolchildren , and special rooms for the audiovisual presentation of subjects hike the interaction of energy and matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present and future uses , and conservation ) . " We 'll have docents in the teaching pits , who will describe the properties of minerals , " Dr. D. Vincent Manson , consultant to the department of minerals , who accompanied us , said . " Eight years of planning have gone into the hall . We 've put the meteorites in front , as a good starting point for the minerals . They and the rocks and precious stones were selected from a collection of eighty-five thousand items . " We learned that the hall , whose floors and walls are carpeted in dark brown , evocative of the earth , occupies a third of an acre , and has humped the old Indians of the Southwest , who are now temporarily retired . ( They will in time , it is hoped , he installed in a brand-new hall . ) Some of the cases were still empty , we noticed , and we were informed that they were awaiting such distinguished occupants as the Star of India sapphire ( 563.35 carats ) , the deLong Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 632 carats ) . A two-and-a-half-ton slab of jade from Poland and a five-hundreda nd-ninety-six-pound pale-y ellow uncut topaz from Brazil were in place , however , and there were scores of attractively mounted , well-lit cases of opals , garnets , tourmalines , aquamarines , and so on . Many of the larger nonprecious exhibits , like smoky quartz from Switzerland , were freestanding , and we were told that the public will be invited to touch them . The hall is curvilinear , and has been laid out on multiple levels , with ramps and stairs leading to many of its displays . We recommend visiting it in sneakers . We called up the museum after our tour to find out when the docents would be in the teaching pits , and were put in touch with an Office of Public Affairs spokesman , who said , " We do n't really like the term teaching pits . ' IVe prefer teaching the amphitheatres mornings during the school year , but we expect visitors to sit down there and contemplate beauty at any time . " Fanfares A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven , we found ourself with a dozen CBS-TV staff members wedged into the miniature control room of a big white mobile broadcast trailer parked outside Avery Fisher Hall . The control-room wall facing us was covered with TV monitors , all of them showing members of the New York Philharmonic warming up for the entrance of Michael ' Filson Thomas , the director of the Buffalo Philharmonic . The occasion was the last of this season 's Young People 's Concerts  --  events that Ernest Schel/ing initiated in 1924 and that Thomas inherited from Leonard Bernstein four years ago . For this particular program , to be broadcast sometime in October , Thomas had chosen " Fanfares and Fugues "  - -  specifically , a collection of old trumpet calls , the fanfare that opens Monteverdi 's " Orfeo , " the March from " Tannhiiuser " ( which is based on a fanfare ) , the first movement of Bach 's third Orchestral Suite ( in which a fanfare is used to announce a fugue ) , and the fourth movement of Aaron Copland 's Symphony No. 3 ( which begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man in charge of taping the performance for television was Robert Myhrum , who usually directs soap operas , and who is noted around the industry for an ability to crack jokes and cue cameras at almost the same moment . As eleven-thirty neared and the dress rehearsal was due to begin , however , Myhrum , hunched over the control console in front of the wall of monitors , seemed rather tense . So did everyone else in the trailer , and the atmosphere reminded us of Mission Control just before blast-off . Unlike most television programs taped these days , a live symphony concert can not he reshot . Taping the dress rehearsal , which lacks an audience , provides a little backup in case something goes wrong during the performance , but essentially the procedure is as risky as the live presentation used in the old days of TV . " O.K. , let 's quiet the orchestra , " said Myhrum at 11 ; 28:34 by the digital clock . " Michael can come on , please . Ease hack , Two , follow him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack was the cameraman in charge of Camera No. 2 , a new handheld German Ferneseh camera , who was standing right among the orchestra members . Camera No. 5 ? there was a total of six cameras connected to the mobile unit by a total of over a mile of cable  --  was also hand-held , and for a number of shots the cameraman operating No. 5 stood on a stepladder placed between two double basses . Thomas , a slight man of thirty-one with a neat dark heard , smiled , walked to the podium , and pointed his baton . " Five ! " said Myhrum . A trumpet blasted . On the color monitor above eight smaller black-and-white monitors , there appeared a dapper Philharmonic trumpeter blowing the call to the post . As the dress rehearsal proceeded , we noted that TV directing and orchestra conducting are very similar procedures , almost the exact inverse of each other : Thomas was using visible physical gestures to coordinate the flow of sound , and Myhrum was using the invisible sound of his voice through sets of headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas had his baton , and Myhrum 's equivalent was the TV-directorial convention of snapping the fingers at the moment a certain shot is to appear on the screen : " Ready , Five , baby . Ease it back a little , frame the piccolo , and ... Five ! Snap ! " Both men worked from the orchestra scores . Jerome D. Cohen , the conductor of the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra , whom Thomas had suggested as a musical assistant for the production , sat next to Myhrum and counted bars of music aloud , tapping the scores with a pencil . As the orchestra approached the end of a piece , Cohen and Myhrum counted down the remaining bars together , except that Myhrum 's count ended with the number of the camera : " Four three ... two ... and Siv ! Snap ? " Everyone seemed happy with the way the dress rehearsal went , and toward the end of the Copland symphony Myhrum and Cohen were up out of their chairs waving their arms and shouting . Myhrum is exultant when he feels he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to pull off his headphones and toss them in the air when a scene works really well . During the break before the performance , at two o'clock , we had lunch with Jerry Golod , CBS v.-p. in charge of children 's programming a job he took over last June after three years of heading a TV production company affiliated with Dancer Fitzgerald Sample , Inc. , a big New York ad agency . " The Y.P.C.s are really a nice thing for us , " he said . " There are very few chances in the industry to do specials for kids other than the prime-time ' Charlie Brown ' sort of program . These concerts are now part of ' The CBS Festival of Lively Arts for Young People ' ? Sundays from 5 to 6 P.M. The other shows in the series have been things like Alvin Ailey and the Peking Opera . " We asked him how this Y.P.C. was going . " Very well , I should say , " said Golod . " This is the first one Bob has produced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . Michael is a very , very busy young guy , and Bob 's gone to see him in Buffalo , and we thought at one point he 'd have to meet him in San Francisco . What we 're working toward are some new ideas . Michael is very , very creative and has lots of new ideas , and we want to try some of them out . " Back in the trailer for the afternoon performance , we watched Myhrum direct a tricky piece of business during the Bach : he popped four pictures onto the screen at once , one in each quadrant , timed to the entrance of each voice in the Orchestral Suite 's four-part fugue . The entire program went off very well . Myhrum said after it was over that he had made two mistakes in timing , but everyone congratulated him and said that the mistakes could be mended during editing . He walked out of the trailer and into the greenroom , where Thomas was signing programs held out by young admirers . " Michael , " said Myhrum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas said , grinning . " It was such a nice show . " The Custodians THE New York City Bicentennial Corporation entertained the British Bicentennial Heritage Mission at Fraunces Tavern not long ago : champagne and crayfish tails in the room in which Washington said farewell to his officers ; hands across the sea ; peace with honor . It was a ceremony in which the British lion 's tail was only gently twisted . The British lion was represented by Ian Campbell , twelfth ( and a very young ) Duke of Argyll ; John A. Murray , ninth ( and an even younger ) Earl of Dunmore ; Edward J. B. Douglas-Scott-Montagu , third Baron Montagu of Beaulieu , a hobbyist who owns a live steam locomotive named Stowe , is the author of " The Motoring Montagus , " and is president of the British Historic Houses Association ; Sir Hugo R. B. Boothby , fifteenth Baronet and premier Baronet of Wales ; David Lindesay-Bethune , who is Viscount Garnock and heir to the fourteenth Earl of Lindsay , and is also vice-chairman of the Dean Clough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and owner of two steam locomotives , one named The Great Marquess and the other nameless ; Vivian D. Lipman , Director of Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings , and the man in charge of the Beefeaters ; and Lawrence E. M. Rich , environmentalist extraordinary  --  that is , Assistant Secretary of the National Trust , which controls one acre out of every hundred in the United Kingdom , the controlled acres comprising a hundred and fifty stately homes , a hundred gardens , two thousand farms , seventeen entire villages , and a good third of the country 's best coastline . All the lions except Mr. Lipman sported handsome Bicentennial ties  --  crossed Union Jacks and Stars and Stripes on a blue ground , with a silk lining emblazoned " Palm Beach " ? and they embodied a splendid representation of What the Perfectly Dressed Man will wear . Missing from the assemblage were two members  --  the Duke of Marlborough , whose seat is Blenheim , and the Marquess of Tavistock , whose father 's , the Duke of Bedford 's , seat is Woburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivities by Ambassador Angier Biddle Duke , the city 's Commissioner of Civic Affairs and Public Events , and we were represented by our own Envoy Plenipotentiary , an old acquaintance of Lord Garnock . Our man 's suit was a six-year-old black serge with a double chalk stripe and a peak-lapelled , scooped-out , double-breasted waistcoat  --  regalia that he saves for what he likes to call meeting the adversary on his own ground . Lord Montagu identified himself as the head of the Bicentennial Mission , and explained to our E.P . that his group had come to wish the States many happy returns , and to remind us that until 1783 , as the British saw it , we were subjects of King George III and to inform us that if we wished to know more about our past we could do worse than visit the historic homes of the British Isles . Our man said he was glad to he set right , because he had always assumed that Robert Morley was head of this mission  --  if not , indeed , Prime Minister . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have greatly increased Americans ' interest in the stately homes of England , " said the E.P . " ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' has greatly increased interest in seeing the kitchens , nurseries , and servants ' halls of the stately homes as well as the grand saloons , " replied Lord Montagu . " Nobody would have thought thirty years ago , what with death duties and all , that we would today still be in our houses , or that the houses would even exist . But we opened up our doors , and by sacrificing our privacy we got fifty million paying visitors a year ; the French only get ten million . No one thought of this as infra dig  --  we took to it like ducks to water . Actually , we are unpaid custodians of our own houses . And we live over the shop . The Historic Houses Association is sort of an aristocratic trade union , And I must say that the Socialist Government has been much friendlier to our effort than the Tory Government " " I see , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I would n't make that assumption , " said the Duke of Argyll . " Actually , there 's nothing new in all this , " said Montagu . " Many of the great houses were open to the public in the eighteenth century  --  only , the servants , not the masters , got the money then . In the seventeen-seventies , Lord Lyttclton , of Hagley Hall , wrote a letter saying , ' Coaches full of travellers of all denominations , and troops of holiday neighbors , are hourly chasing me from my apartments or , by strolling about the environs keeping me prisoner in it . The Lord of the place can never call it his for a day during the finer part of the year . ' " " Blenheim is so close to Oxford it was overrun with visitors before it was even completed , " said Lord Dunmore . " Yes , " said Montagu . " And there was a sign about visitors outside Chatsworth in the eighteenth century that said , ' Every day of the week except Sunday by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . ' In the last few years , visiting historic houses has become an English week- ? end pastime . This is all a terrifically big business now  --  a hundred million dollars a year  --  and the survival of the great houses is insured . " " It all gives one a good feeling , " said Sir Hugo Boothhy , Bart. , of Fonmon Castle , near Barry , on the south coast of Wales . " One feels that one will he damned if one has to be the generation to pack it up . I 'm jolly well going to keep the place open for my son , and he 's keen on getting it . " Sir Hugo , as premier Baronet of Wales , was privileged to carry a banner with the Welsh dragon on it at the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969 . " A friend of mine  --  chap whose baronetcy is two or three years younger , dates back to 1663 was quite put out about my being asked to carry the banner , " he told our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace at home , actually . After the ceremony , I asked the Duke of Norfolk what I should do with it , and he said , ' Pop it in the back of the bus . ' So I asked the Garter King of Arms , and he said , ' Possession is nine points , you know . ' I 've been wondering if some chap from the Department of the Environment would come and take it away and tell me it was his . " The Envoy Plenipotentiary said he had noted that some of the stately homes he 'd been through recently had considerably expanded their amenities . Montagu brightened . " At Beaulieu , my place , we take away half a ton of litter a day , " he said . " We have the National Motor Museum at my place , ? and I sometimes almost think if you have a good free car park , a restaurant , plenty of lavatories ? " " Stately loos , " said Dunmore . " Right , " said Montagu . " And have something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've got in your stately home . We 're going to find out how Disney World and Williamsburg and a lot of other places handle this while we 're over here , and teach the French when we get hack . It 's a matter of changing their mental attitude . The French were the great absentee landlords of all time , you know . They were off at Versailles while we were home working our estates . " Mr. Rich , of the National Trust , said that the peers who had given their homes to his group deserved praise for giving money for upkeep as well . " I ca n't see some Italian nobleman socking away great chunks of actual monetary fortune to look after his palazzo or whatever it is , " he said . Our man asked about J. Paul Getty , who removed himself from the United States to England and bought the countryseat called Sutton Place . " Ah , " said the Duke of Argyll . " He 's so much richer than any of us he does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Montagu . " We 're all sometimes a little bit jealous of Paul Getty . He has the only stately home in England that has been withdrawn from public viewing since the Second World War . "
