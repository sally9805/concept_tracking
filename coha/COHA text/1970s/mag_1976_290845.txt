For all the scorn heaped on the second office in the republic , the modern-day fact is that vice-presidential virus is only slightly less contagious than presidential fever . One reason is that four of our last eight Vice Presidents have become President . Nelson Rockefeller used to be openly contemptuous of the post , noting that he did not consider himself to be stand-by equipment ; when the job was offered he quickly accepted it . Robert Kennedy in 1964 convinced his friends how really awful he thought it would be to serve as Lyndon Johnson 's running mate . Not long afterward he tried , and failed , to muscle his way onto the ticket . <P> Henry Jackson , at 64 one of the most powerful members of the Senate , startled his closest advisers last week when he told them privately he wanted to be Jimmy Carter 's running mate , but he does not think the Georgian will pick him . For his own part . Carter has a comfortable period of several weeks to consider Jackson and the growing list of names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , too much . He is sure to keep the guessing game alive as a way to hold the spotlight until the convention . The Republicans know no such comfort : Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan are headed for a delegate battle that makes it difficult for either one to consider picking a running mate without the approval of the other . <P> There is a new and deep concern this year about the historically haphazard way in which the vice-presidential nominees are chosen-after George McGovern 's 1972 fiasco with Senator Tom Eagleton , after the resignation of Spiro Agnew , after the ascension of unelected Gerald Ford . A study on the subject , released this week by Harvard 's Kennedy Institute , maintained that " the present selection practices contain an inherent and unacceptable degree of risk . " The odds are now 1 to 2 , the study judges , that the Vice President will one day become President . <P> Although the prestige of the office seems to be returning to the level that its founders saw in it , choosing the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too often left to the " personal judgment of the nominee , a judgment often exercised rapidly and in confusion in the small hours of the morning . " The report urges that the process be more public and that there be sufficient time for background checks on the candidates . <P> Carter has the time for all of that . He has stated he wants the man most qualified to take over the office . He also is searching for someone who can fill gaps in his own experience and run strong in areas of the country where Carter has not-for example , the Far West and Northeast . The two candidates who best fit that strategy , in the minds of professional politicians , are both Senators : Minnesota 's Walter Mondale , 48 , and Idaho 's Frank Church , 51 . Mondale , a cool , skillful legislator and campaigner , would provide Carter wide bridges to labor and liberals , where the Georgian is still uneasily feeling his way . Mondale is also strong with Jewish leaders .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
