txt SERIN , Thailand  --  Once upon a time , Ban Loa : Bah was a prosperous farming tow n of 5,000 in northwestern Cambodia . Times were good . The town was relatively untouched by the five-year-old Camhldian civil war . Times were especiallgood for Ko Vim son of the village chief . ' That was before April 17 , 1975 , the day Communist troops of the Khmer Rouge victoriously marched into Phnom Penh , Cambodia 's capital , and seized control of the nation . SOON AFTER , Khmer Rouge soldiers entered Ban Loot 130h . In the last 2 ' , h years , the town has been turned into a virtual slave-labor camp , and the people have suffered horribly . As of two weeks ago Friday , 2,700 persons had died from disease and malnutrition , and 700 persons had been murdered by the " liberating " Khmer Rouge troops . Two weeks ago Friday , three Khmer Rouge soldiers carrying automatic rifles and wearing black pajama uniforms stopped in front of Ko Vin 's farmhouse and called out his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was struck dumb with terror as he glanced wide-eyed at his son . They had discussed this before , and they knew this day would come , but it made the reality no less frightening . Wordlessly , the father went outside to meet his executioners . They bound the elderly man 's hands and fest with rape before putting bins in an ox cart . lie has n't been seen or heard of since . Ko , a tall , handsome bachelor , slipped into the jungle that same day and ran away from Cambodia to the Thai city of Surin , 20 miles from the border , but he said he knows what happened to his father . " THEY DID WITH bins what they did to everyone else , " Ko said last week . " They took hits to the cemetery and clubbed the back of his head until he died . Then they left him to rot in a shallow grave . " Nobody knows how many have died in Cambodia since the bloody , almost myst i c a I Communist guerrilla army emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you extrapolate the numbers of dead reported by the refugees , it would be 3 million dead by now , " a Western diplomat in Bangkok said . " I 'm not willing to believe the number is that high , but clearly an appalling number have died there . " IF WREST IS happening there Is not unique in recent human history , it is very close to it . ' It is a terrible , terrifying thing . " Most estimates of the number killed since the Communist takeover are 800,000 to 1.5 million in a country of 7 million . They have died in the most excruciating manner . They are being starved , denied medicine , and just plain slaughtered . " I HAD HOPED when I came to Thalland that these excessive numbers of dead would turn out just to be inflated figures sensationalized by the press , " the diplomat said . " But I 've talked to thousands of refugees myself now , and I hear the same stories , the same figures . " The Communists evicted Phnom Penh 's 3 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now almost all Cambodians have been shifted into the countryside to do manual labor . Only 50,000 trusted persons remain in the city . KffE3l 0711031MALL : a. was a ria .. tional police inspector in Phnom Penh and saw the rapacity of the guerrillas // Slaughter and starvation mark Khmer Rouge rule // from the day they won the war . When the Communists entered the city , Khem stripped off his police uniform , dressed in simple clothing , and hid with his wife and 11-month-old son in their home . " About II a.m . ( April 17 , 19751 , the Khmer Rouge said over the radio that all people in the city must move away . They said the Americans were angry about losing the war and were going to bomb Phnom Penh , " nem recalled . KIIEM MINED the sad exodus , watching soldiers roust even the sick and badly wounded from hospitals , forcing them to march until they died . On the third day , a sound truck came down the road announcing that all former policemen from Phnom Penh should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a ruse to mark him for death , Klima said he was a student and was permitted to take his family to his wife 's village . HE STAYED FOR a month , until relatives said the Khmer Rouge had identified him and were planning to kill him . " My wife took me to the village gate with some rice and eggs and told me that I should only worry about saving my own life , " Khem said . His wife and infant son were publicly executed as a warning to others in the village not to try to escape . THEN BEGAN a two-year odyssey , a flight to stay ahead of those who wanted to kill him . He finally settled in the village of Srey Snam , work ) ing as a field laborer 15 hours a day . The Communist Tribune Me village chief was a cruel , illiterate peasant , he said , who called all COO villagers together one day to lay down the law . " We have no prison in this village , " the chief told them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we have no place to keep you . " We will cut your bodies up and put you in the fields as fertilizer . " KIIEM STAYED in the village for several months , until August , when he saw the identity of a farmer school teacher exposed . The teacher , his wife , and children were bound up and taken away . The next morning Khem found their shallow graves in a field next to the one where Ire was working , Ile slipped into the jungle and walked for five days into Thailand , 40 pounds underweight and nearly starved . It is not only the former officials of the old government who are being killed . The same harsh life has been imposed on the peasants . MAO TIIANG is a 35-year-old illiterate peasant who walked into Thailand a week ago Saturday from Banloath Bah , his ancestral village in Cambodia where 3,500 have died . , " I do n't know what is wrong in Cambodia , " he said . ' " Before the Khmer Rouge came , we had a lot of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventeen Khmer Rouge soldiers and 25 civilian adminstrators appeared at his village after the Communist victory , he said . THEM LEADER was Math Oeung , a 26-year-old soldier who immediately sent every able-bodied man , woman , and child into the fields . " 1 had orders to work from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m . I lived and worked like a machine , " Mao said . Food is rationed to two meals a day , he said . Each meal consists of half a can of rice and salt for adults , less for the children . A small piece of meat or fish appears in the rice perhaps once every two weeks . THE LONG . arduous working hours and the scant diet soon took its loll , Mao said . Women and children became ill first from malnutrition and disase . They were sent to hospital huts where there was no medication , and most died . Women had difficulty conceiving , and when they did become pregnant , two-thirds of the children were dead at childbirth . If the children survived the birth , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STARVATION AND disease killed 2,509 persons in the village , Mao said , including his 50-year-old father , who warned his son before lie died : " I will ( lie soon , and you will live . But I do n't think you will live long . The work is too hard , and they do n't give us enough to eat . " As horrible as the starvation was , Mao said , the Tribune reporter William Mullen is on special assignment in Thailand to interview newly arrived Cambodian refugees about reported atrocities in Cam bodia . Through those refugees Mullen has learned what has been happening in Cam bodia since the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975 and imposed a complete news blackout over the country . Mullen has written on special assignments in Southeast Asia since 1972 , when he covered a part of the Viet Nam War . He won the 1975 gradual murder of 1,000 other villagers was even more terrifying . " WHEN TIIEY started killing us , we did n't know what we had done wrong , " Mao said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former teachers , students , government men , and especially village defensemen . " People are rarely shot , he said , but simply taken out of sight and clubbed to death . " Sometimes we found people in rice bags In the river . The soldiers had tied them up and put them in bags and threw them into the water to drown . " " SOMETIMES AT night we were 811 called for village meetings , and you would hear people start to scream as they looked around . Where Is my father ? Where is my brother ? " They went to work in the morning , but were taken from the fields by the soldiers during the day and never seen again , " Mao said . Why so many people are being killed and who is ordering their deaths is a mystery to Mao . He said he never knew the names of Cambodia 's leaders before the war and is even less aware of who the Communist leaders are . FOR THAT MATTER , nobody has a clear Idea who is running Cambodia , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cambodian borders as soon as they took control and have operated in strict secrecy since . During the first two years of Communist rule , the only regularly used name for the leaders was " Angka , " roughly translated to mean " the organization . " When the Communists did anything , they said it was on orders from Angka . Angka is believed to be a small , tightly knit group of Communist leaders trained as younger men in the Soviet Union . REFUGEE DESCRIPTIONS make it clear that Angka is attempting to rub out every vestige of traditional Cambodian life . Families are split Into work gangs organized according to age to perform assigned tasks . Young children collect and spread fertilizer . Older children dig irrigation ditches . Adults clear , prepare , plant , and harvest the rice fields , while the elderly are left in the villages to tend the very young . AN " INTELLECTUAL " is defined as anybody with more than a 7th grade education , so schooling is rudimentary and highly political . The women are expected to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare and serve food at central kitchens . " We tried to catch frogs and rodents because they only gave us rice and salt to eat , but we were even punished for that , " said Bou Savouen , 22 , a woman who used to live in Tean Kam , a village where 3,000 have died . " We caught them while we worked in the field and cooked them secretly , because the Khmer Rouge said we were wasting time that had to be made up . " TIIEY KILLED those who they thought were bad workers , " she said . " Sometimes when a soldier wanted to test his gun , he would use it to kill those who were condemned . " Most of the time they clubbed Chem to death , and when they were going to kill people , the rest of us were not allowed to watch , but we heard them , anyway .

TILE KIISIER ROUGE makes a distinction between " new people " anti " old people , " the old people being 3 million Cambodians who lived under Communist rule during the war . This distinction makes some analysts fear that 4 million " new people " may be marked for death . " It 's just inexplicable , " one Western diplomat said . " Angka , whatever it is and whoever they are , seem to have developed a mystical intellectual vision of what they wanted Cambodia to be after the war . Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his series on starvation in Africa and India . This is the first of two reports on Cambodia . Mao Thang ( left ) , an illiterate Cambodian peasant from Bantoath Bah , and Bou Savouen , a refugee from Tean Kam , talk about the reign of terror in their homeland . " When they started PhIte , killing us , we did n't know what we had done wrong . " Mao says . " They never explained , but most of those killed were former teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIIEY WON , they apparently thought they had to move rapidly and ruthlessly . " The destruction of the old Cambodian society seems complete . It was once a happy , sensual land where sexuality was open and free . Now people are killed for holding hands in public , and marriage has been approved only recently after a two-year ban . In a once devoutly Buddhist land , religion is no longer condoned , and 70,000 monks have been forced into hard labor . " FROM 1975 ON , they destroyed all of 916 temples and all of our statues of Buddha , " said Kkeo Chan , army officer from the old regime and now Cambodian chief of the Surin refugees . " They used the stones from the temples to build new roads . We hear they took away the Buddha statue and pictures and precious stones from Angkor Wat , leaving only the temple with nothing inside . " They have left our people with nothing but hunger and death . We have nothing left to live for except the dream to escape . " Monday : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
