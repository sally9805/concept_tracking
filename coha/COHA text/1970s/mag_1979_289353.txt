CORIOLANUS by William Shakespeare <P> Coriolanus is Shakespeare 's prickliest hero . We first see him berating the Roman plebeians as scum simply because they want some bread for their empty bellies . Next we marvel at the man 's un matched valor as he bests the Volscians , sometimes in singlehanded combat . The man of flinty aristocratic pride storms into view when he is honored with the rank of Roman consul , only to be banished when he reviles the tribunes of the commoners instead of currying their favor with mock humility and an ostentatious public display of his battle scars . When he turns against Rome and joins its enemies in a temper tantrum of crazed revenge , he is a scalded boy bent on killing the dearest thing he loves . <P> It takes an actor of liquid fire and the keenest intelligence to carry all of that off , and Morgan Freeman accomplishes it in this rousing production of the play at Joseph Papp 's off-Broadway Public Theater . It also requires one other thing , a figure of equal mettle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloria Foster not only takes the stage , she rules it . With impassioned grandeur , she drives her lethal lance of love through her son 's vulnerable heart . She glories in his martial wounds , she would rather see him dead than have his honor stained . <P> With her pleas , she saves Rome and delivers Coriolanus to his doom . The look of ashen grief frozen on Foster 's face at that moment is desolating . Running in repertory with Julius Caesar , Coriolanus makes an auspicious seasonal debut for this new Black-Hispanic troupe. - T.E . Kalem
