MURIDA E A S PAUL , COMING HOME from work , entered his large apartment in the East Eighties , he once again felt the vague hostility in the air . That meant everyone was home . It was deathly quiet . That meant everyone was meditating . Gone was the happy cocktail hour when Marian and the girls would gather around him to hear how his day had gone . Now he was expected to go into his study and meditate too . But he was damned if he would today . He went into the living room and poured himself a drink . If he wished , he , too , could sit down and close his eyes  --  and get into that state where gray phosphorescence boiled up behind his eyelids  --  but he did n't feel like it . Besides , despite having paid $150 for it , he disliked his mantra . He had never dared tell anyone this  --  certainly not Marian and the girls , who claimed to have acquired great relaxation and spiritual insight from meditating . They would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just some meaningless syllables . But his did mean something ... the name of a Japanese beer he had drunk quarts of during the Occupation . In any case , although meditating seemed to do Marian and the girls good they said it made them more efficient ? it seemed to put him in a state of dull acquiescence . Drink in hand , he went over to the window and gazed down below at the park . Dull acquiescence . The tips of the trees were just turning green . It brought back to him a vision of several years ago when the girls were little and they would all go bicycling as a family Sunday mornings in Central Park ... the girls in their matching red plaid trousers , white pullovers , long chestnut hair flying in the spring wind , and Marian , a handsome woman , with her good legs , athletic , always younger than her years , and Paul himself , serenely smiling  --  he was certain he would have been smiling  --  a big man astride his English bike , in his sweat shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut hair just the right length between swinger and family man . They must A story by M. Cameron Grey have been just what the mayor had in mind when he declared New York Fun City . The trouble was , Paul thought , they were such an easy target for ail the bright ideas that came along . They seemed to have gone from togetherness to nuclear family with no element of choice . The setting seemed to have changed around them . Now , when the five of them tried to do anything together , it felt like moving a lot of lumber about in a very small room . Well , growing up was hard for the girls , and growing older was hard on Marian . She was conscientious , educated , energetic , outgoing  --  had brought all these qualities to motherhood , and then suddenly the girls , though beautiful , were big , sullen , private . Until recently . Now women 's liberation had brought them together , and he was the patsy . It was difficult to learn exactly what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always let Marian do precisely what she wanted to do . But often now it seemed as if the mere sight of him enraged them . His success as a lawyer was suspect , the money , food , clothes , education he gave them were suspect , and , most baffling of all , the love he felt for them was suspect . As a liberal lawyer he had willingly helped Marian with her various crusades , had commiserated with the girls over the injustices they experienced as women  --  they could be crane op- erators if they wanted to  --  but still , evidently , he stood accused by the mere fact of being a man , husband and father . Marti m Avillez Marian believed in lots of sex . So did he , really , although recently the prospect tired him more than it delighted him . Marian had read several new books on the importance of the clitoris , and this had changed their lovemaking . She had come to the conclusion that many of her thitherto orgasms had been " accidental " ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one to interfere with another 's pleasure . Marian could have what she wanted . Still , he felt at the mercy of yet another idea . Pursued to its logical conclusion , it seemed to imply that the penis was on its way out . He caught a glance of their embrace in the mirror . They looked so romantic . He supposed he could find a lot of women left who did n't believe in women 's liberation . But he did n't want them . Did n't want the deception in his marriage , did n't want some woman pretending he was great , did n't want a woman limited enough to believe he was great . He wanted Marian  --  the way she used to be . Dinner was a casserole Marian had put together after coming home from her work for the ERA . The girls served , with the understanding that it was his turn to do the dishes afterwards . Well , he did n't mind that . Scraping them and putting them in the machine was a change after a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covertly surveyed his lumber . At times his tennis friends would ask him , " How do you take it , surrounded by women all the time ? " They would try to commiserate with him for having no sons . But Paul would laugh . He had been raised in a houseful of boys his mother worn out at forty by his father and all their wild male demands . He had had enough of that . Looking at Marian and Hilary and Barbara and Robin , he realized all over again that he was crazy about them . Apparently he loved women  --  everything about them delighted him . He even loved the bathrooms cluttered with flowery lotions , shampoos , perfumes , and now New Freedom Mini-pads . And he was a fool for Marian 's perfect breasts and thighs  --  and all the lovely hollows and roundnesses of the female body . He had adored watching his little girls develop into young women , filling out the jeans , ballooning the Indian shirts .... They seemed impatient to get back to whatever they were doing before dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real conversation with them . Lovely , big , beautiful girls , they sat there , like herd animals sniffing the wind , waiting for him to say something oppressive to them . He had learned not to say , " How was school ? " That was putting them down for still being in school while he wasout in the real world . He could not ask them about boyfriends  --  that was treating them like sex objects . He could ask them how they felt ? but that often released such a torrent of self-analysis on how it felt to be a woman , dependent on men for everything from money to behavior , that he had to be feeling particularly strong . More and more he was finding it easier to be silent . " What 's the matter , Paul ? " Marian said . " Nothing . " " Hard day at the orifice ? " Hilary asked . She could achieve quite an ironic tone for a fifteen-year-old . No doubt his fleeting impulse to belt her one  --  into niceness  --  was a recalcitrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him . Test case . But he was tired . " No ... not really ... " T HE CASSEROLE sal . in his stomach like lead . When he had put the dishes in the machine he went to his study and worked on a brief until Marian came in and nuzzled his earlobe . After their lovemaking , he lay beside her , sleepless . She had immediately dropped off with a happy little sigh . He tried to think about his life , to pull-it together somehow , to define it  --  it seemed to be slipping away from him  --  but all he could think of was , " The salt has lost its savor . " He tried rhyming savor . : . save her ... shave her .... He had another big day tomorrow , a tricky case , and here he was , tense and thoroughly depressed . He 'd used up the last of the sleeping pills . Although it was against instructions , he thought of meditating to get to sleep . Well . Why not ? He settled himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .. Japanese beer ... Japanese beer ... Although the gray phosphorescence promised to foam up soon , the thought of Japanese beer immediately called forth his drearier memories of the Army . He opened his eyes . Dammit , why could n't he have been given a decent mantra like everyone else ? Something Indian and mystical . He thought of various Indian names . Bhagavadgita ... too long ... Kali ... no ... Shiva ? . . . Shiva had a nice sound . . . . He closed his eyes again . Shiva ... Shiva ... It seemed to work very well . Better , in fact . The gray foam was developing a slight golden tinge around the edges , and he could feel him-self drifting away , his body becoming weight . less , his mind nicely blank until suddenly , with no effort at all , he was a baby mouse on the pillow . He was hairless , a bit chilled , with his eyes only half open , curled on the pillow beside Marian 's . He stretched and could dimly see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strangely , he was filled with a tremendous health , and a high note of excitement vibrated in the air around him . Although lie felt totally a baby mouse  --  he could even taste the mother 's milk left in his mouth  --  he could still think , and be thought , profoundly , " So I 've finally got it together . " He yawned  --  a delicious drowsiness came over him  --  and he plunged into a deep infant sleep . At the breakfast table , he was abstracted . " What 's the matter , Paul ? " " Nothing . " But he was saying " Nothing " too much these days , so he made the effort . " I dreamt I was a baby mouse last night . " This produced unwonted hilarity . " Oh , daddy , " Barbara said . Marian smiled at him . " Did you enjoy it ? " " As a matter of fact , I did . " " Classic , " Hilary said . " Just classic . " " What is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming of genitals . " a UT IN THE TAXI going to his office he was certain he had not dreamt of genitals . He knew a sex dream when he had one . This was something else . The experience of being a baby mouse kept piercing him with its vividness  --  the flood of well-being , the perfection of his little body functioning away at a deliriously high metabolic rate ... but , above all , the clarity and atone-ness of his mind  --  it was a spiritual dream . He wished he knew what it meant . The peace of it brimmed over into his day ... a heady combination of peace and excitement .... He could hardly wait to meditate again with his new mantra . He went through the day with his usual efficiency , even through two trial cases in the morning  --  although , in the middle of cross-examining one witness , he was suddenly struck by how unimportant the case was , how unimportant it all was , and he paused between questions , gazing for a long time beyond the witness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold disbelief , he realized , returning to his office , and may have contributed to his winning the case . That evening he went with Marian to an all-woman concert at Lincoln Center , and although part of him registered the heavy tonesof Bartok , the sight of womanly thighs encasing cellos , he was restless and impatient . The girls were in bed when they returned , and fortunately Marian was tired and went to sleep . immediately . Free , he settled himself and closed his eyes . Shiva ... Shiva ... Sheeevah ... the familiar phosphorescence began to play beneath his eyelids , although this time it filled his whole head and was shot with streaks of golden light .... Almost immediately he was a mouse again . This time with hair and whiskers . He was crouching on the pillow in an attitude of intense alertness . Marian loomed huge and white beside him . He was no longer an infant  --  the peace of infancy had been replaced by a tremendous exhilaration . His heart was thudding in his young chest he realized he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt very new , the hair on his body silky , his pink feet translucent . He brought up his hack leg and stroked a large velvet ear , passing his back foot down over his face ro trace the ends of his vibrating whiskers . Hesitantly he stepped out on the pillowcase , feeling the harsh weave of the muslin under his feet . He would have laughed , but now found that he could not laugh , that he did not need to laugh -- his whole body was laughter . The Paul in him said , " I suppose I should pull myself together , " which made no sense : he had never been so together . He felt a violent desire to run and scampered in circles around the pillowcase . It was fun , but not completely satisfying . He had an urge to do much more , and realized he was now three-dimensional . Magically , he descended the bed leg and crossed the parquet floor . Everything , the chair legs , his giant shoes and socks , was bathed in a luminosity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could feel large and dark in his head . He set off down the hall , with the intention of going to see the girls sleeping in their beds , but was detoured by the powerful smell of peanuts in the silver dish in the living room . Crouching between the silver cigarette lighter and silver framed photographs of the girls , he gorged himself on one . It was marvelous being able to eat and laugh at the same time . With his belly suddenly round , ho crawled down the coffee-table leg and pushed his way through the nap of the living-room rug  --  then found he could jump , which he did , in long bounds down the hall to Hilary 's room . He realized he was looking for someone to play with . But she was too huge and white and had faintly the smell of Marian . Barbara , in the next bed , was not much better . He scuttered into Robin 's room , and with Robin , who was only twelve , he felt a certain kinship . Crouching on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her pillow , he gazed into her large expanse of face . There was no joy there , but about the corners of the enormous mouth there was still the softness and vulnerability of youth . The sight sobered him . Through his joy he felt a fatherly pang of worry for her . Immediately a frightening sense of dissolution ran through his bones . Some terrible threat hung over him . Heart pounding , whiskers rigid , he dragged himself back to his bed , defecating the peanut on the way . With his last strength he climbed the bed leg . No sooner had he attained the pillowcase than he was Paul again . He was breathing heavily , bewildered ... yet left with a shimmering memory of delight .... " Another terrific dream , " he thought , and fell into a deep sleep . T WAS HARD TO WAKE UP in the morning . He heard the alarm from a great distance , and then Marian was joggling him , shaking his shoulder . " Paul ? Come on , Paul , you 'll be late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged himself up to a sitting position , holding his head in his hands . " Wow , " he said . " You look like you 'd been out on the town last night . What 's the matter , Paul ? Did n't you sleep well ? " " I ... " his rapturous cavortings of the night filled him with wonder . " I ... " He even drew a hand across his lips to feel the long whiskers , tentatively touched his fingers to his ear . Then the human hairs on the back of his neck rose . He stared at the parquet floor , where , beside his bare feet , rested , undeniably , several little mouse droppings . Paul did not go to his club for lunch . Instead , he walked over to Bryant Park and sat there under the trees , a reasonable man in a turmoil of confusion . The only thing he could remotely equate his feelings to was being in love . Not as it was with Marian . This was some wild , absolutely forbidden love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he in love with ? Being a mouse ? The incredibility of it came at him in waves . Still , last night was no dream . He had become a young mouse , and the intense reality of it still shook him to his cordovan shoes . Not for a moment did he feel he was sick or going crazy . It was very simple . Through his unorthodox meditation , he had stumbled on something absolutely marvelous . Although he was not a religious man , he even wondered if he might not have stumbled on his own reincarnation , or someone else 's . Whatever it was , with all the powerful , perverse willfulness of love , it was all he wanted . He sat on the stone bench and stared with growing disbelief at the gravel at his feet . Disbelief in the gravel . He stood up abruptly . But what if he could n't get back from being a mouse ? That would n't be so funny . What of Marian and the girls , his career , his life ? Obviously he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it was had all the terror and irresistible appeal of a secret , suddenly realized vice . This sensible line of thought made him abruptly desolate . The gray consciousness of his manhood came over him like a shroud . He was nuts . Or he was tired  --  perhaps having male menopause ... it was a bad time for all of them . It was n't easy to be a middle-aged woman these days , or a teen-ager , with everything falling apart , roles confused , values questioned ... He walked on down Fifth Avenue . Waiting for the green light at Thirty-ninth Street , he thought of Robin 's sleeping face , and of his fatherly pang of protectiveness  --  even as he had sat watching her in his happy young mousedom .... The light changed , he stepped off  --  and suddenly he stood stock-still while traffic blared at him . That was it ! Worry turned him back into a man ! How simple ! Meditation turned him into a mouse ; worry into a man . He could have control . With an incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dictated twenty-seven letters while waiting for nighttime . M ARIAN WANTED TO READ in bed , and she took an unconscionable amount of time falling asleep over her book . He held a book in his hands too . When he was sure she was really under , he took her book and placed it on her bedside table , removed her glasses , and turned out the light . He kissed the back of her neck . " Goodnight , " he whispered . Then , Shiva . . . Shiva . . . Shee . . . vah . . ? the phosphorescence before his eyes was all golden now , it billowed up and poured around him until , with breathtaking abruptness , he found himself sitting up on his hind legs on the pillow . He was immediately aware of the tremendous depth and breadth of his chest , the power of his legs ; the hair on his body had become thicker and was sticking straight out , electrified by the huge , close , repellent presence of Marian . He scampered down the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hallway , compelled to lick his fur all over , which he could do with lightning rapidity ; it became sleek and shining in the light from the bathroom . Then he could take stock . If infancy was peace , and adolescence ecstasy , this was compounded of the two  --  as well as something else , august and thrilling . He was perfect . Everything about him was elegant , thrusting , sinuous , sure . All of his senses were at an extraordinary pitch . He took a step forward il and found he had huge balls between his hind Il legs . They were heavy , magical , like furnaces 11 that propelled him forward . He had so many thick , possible desires he did n't know which 1 to fulfill first , but he loped down the hall to 1 the bathroom and took a long , excruciatingly 1 sweet drink of water from a puddle in the shower . Then he scudded along to the kitchen , where he paused on one of the black squares of the checkered linoleum floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was attacking - it with powerful rodent teeth when suddenly on the white square next to him a shape materialized  --  a shape surrounded by a pungent , infuriating odor . He instantly recognized it as one of his own kind  --  and went into his fighting stance  --  legs spread , feet splayed out , tail in the air . Stiff-legged , he hurled his body at his opponent , a battle shriek was torn from his throat , he heard the snap of teeth in his ears and the breath of his opponent come out with a startled thud . He hurled himself again . He could feel he was fighting a bigger , heavier body , but it made no difference  --  he had the advantage of total conviction : he was suddenly in a thrilling paroxysm of rage . The glands under his tail spurted an even more pungent odor . Then the body abruptly gave , and retreated . He chased it , nipping at its haunches , to behind the stove , where it became snakelike and oozed down a small hole . Breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table . He was beside himself with victory and righteous anger . The son of a bitch ! Encroaching on his territory ! He never knew there were mice in the apartment . After all he paid for maintenance every month ! He 'd have to tell the super to call the pest-control people ... . Too late ! Too late he realized he had slipped into worrying like a man . He sat up on his hind legs  --  but gray foam swirled around him . his bones dissolved , and he received a terrific crack on the head from the underside of the kitchen table . Marian , roused by the noise , found him sprawled , dazed , on the kitchen floor . " What on earth , Paul ! " Somewhere he found the words . " I was just getting myself a snack. ; " he said . " A midnight snack . " " Under the kitchen table ? " She stood there in her nightgown , for once truly baffled . " I must have slipped , " he said . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , come back to bed , " Marian said . He got into bed beside her and feigned sleep . Actually , he lay there in a haze of happiness , with totally justified , purifying adrenaline coursing through his veins . He had never known the bliss of rage without guilt before . When he did drop off , it was into the fine , mellow sleep of the just . T FIE NEXT DAY Paul felt certain that with one more mouseti  --  ie he could have complete control of the situation . Last night 's debacle he put down to inexperience . He had gotten carried away . Certainly now that he knew the results , he could control when he would worry or not . He foresaw a marvelous life ahead of him ... his days as a man , a gaud man , carrying out his duties to his career , and as a husband and father  --  and his nights , ah , his nights ! The joy of them dominated his day . Instead of feeling trapped , he felt he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the lunch table at the club , he looked at the other men with pity , and thought of Marian and the girls with tenderness . Poor darlings , casting about in confusion .... It was his tennis night at the Armory , and he served powerful line serves , one after the other , following up with smashing net attacks . But , compared to his fight of the night before , his flesh felt sluggish and heavy on his bones , ridiculous sweat poured down over his eyes , and his attention , even at tennis , seemed splintered , thready , pierced by a hundred other useless concerns . In the locker room , as they were showering , his partner said , " Boy , you were hot tonight . What are you taking these days , Paul ? Geritol ? " He laughed , but the subject of age brought a worry to the edge of his mind . In the taxi , alone , he gazed out of the window as the park unrolled past him . There was something disturbing about his recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped Robin with her algebra  --  a delicate task , since there was always the undercurrent that he was condescending to her female mind . Actually , he could barely keep up with her . Under the lamplight of the dining-room table , beside Robin , he tried to figure out what x was . It was a problem in pro- 50 25 8 portions : ? : ? : a . ... He stared at the x 1 a ' figures , then looked up beyond Robin .... He was forty-five ; if , say , thirty years was the potential time left to him  --  he rapidly multiplied 75 by 365 , calculating his number of days  --  then , three nights were to x = the fife span of a mouse . . He felt a chill along his spine . Something was badly wrong with the proportions ! His time as a mouse was being crazily speeded up . He had no idea what the life span of a mouse was . but ... " Daddy , " Robin was saying . " If it bores you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? No. " he said , " It does n't bore me . It does n't bore me at all . " A T NIGHT , IN BED beside Marian , as he listened to her falling asleep , he found he was trembling . He feared what he was going to find when he meditated , and he did not want to face it . He lay there , summoning his courage . Marian had forgotten to draw the curtains , and moonlight was coming through the window and spilling on the floor . He took a deep breath and closed his eyes . " Shiva , " he whispered . The phosphorescence was all golden now , cumulus clouds of it , and he heard a high quivering note , as if his trembling had been transformed into music . It broke off , and he found himself on the pillow , in the act of scuttering away from Marian , darting lightly across her sleeping legs , down off the bed , into the pool of moonlight He sat there , front paws raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more mature . His dark eyes were huge in his head , his whiskers extended like searchlights around him . He ran a long foot over his silvered fur . Yes , the night before he had been a young male  --  now he was in his prime . The muscular joy of the previous night had changed into a richness of  --  he could only call it spirit . He felt kingly . The great testicles he was resting on were filled with generations . His memory stretched back into the dark burrows of antiquity , smoothly , endlessly ... he was part of a great host , his time sense was forever , unbroken both forward and backward and in other new directions , as if time cradled him in its arms . He climbed up onto the windowsill and pressed his nose against the cold pane . He even felt part of the moon ; he was all things . How young the moon was ! lie glided down the hall , passing the bedrooms of the sleeping girls , to the kitchen . In a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither thirst nor hunger interested him now .. ? . A glow came from the hole  --  an extraordinary radiance . He knew it descended to an inconceivable depth which , at the very pit , would change into something transcendent . He could feel his great phallus stirring in its scabbard of fur . There lay his life . He approached the opening , and odors rich and splendid with promise wrapped around him . To his helpless delight he heard strange , far-off singing . But he paused . It was not for him yet . He could not go yet . He had unfinished business . He kept the thought of unfinished business carefully without content so that he would not suddenly become a man , crushed behind the stove . Marveling at his control , he turned away and made his way back to the bedroom . There he crawled up on the pillow beside Marian . It took all the rest of his control to remain beside her , repellent and alien as she was . But he curled up , pressing his long nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds of things to worry about ... the large concerns ... death and taxes , power and greed .... But he chose a small worry . The bill from Hilary 's orthodontist . Not even itemized . It was outrageous .... His long body , in rumpled pajamas twisted around him , informed him he was back again . As he lay there quietly in the cool sheets he found that the glow from the hole seemed to have lodged in his heart . Truly . So that if he opened his pajama top he would find his chest incandescent . He wanted to weep with longing .... He sat up . This was insanity ! He had never bargained for this . What if he had gone down the hole ? God knows what would really happen to him down there . It was obviously so much more than just playing around with some other mice . What , even , if he had lost the fight of the night before , and Marian and the girls hac found his little carcass under the table at breakfast time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... He looked at Marian . He gently placed hand on the soft curve of her hip . She mut tered something in her sleep . He could n't get the words , but they sounded forlorn . Quietly slipping out of bed , he went to Hilary and Barbara 's room . It was so crammed with clothes , books and records , beauty aids and sports equipment , there was no place to sit down , so he stood there looking down at their faces . They were sleeping as if their lives depended on it . And in Robin 's room , she too had her fist clenched into her pillow , her young face sternly baffled . He smiled wanly and , bending down , kissed the spot where her dark hair grew from her temple . Then he returned to bed , taking his place beside Marian . He was suddenly desperately tired . But filled with the warm , dull comfort of renunciation . IS SENSE OF RENUNCIATION remained with him until Len o'clock the next morning . Then , on his way to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a glimpse of a gray squirrel whisking up a tree and was suddenly shattered by an intolerable sense of loss . He sat down heavily on a bench . This was hopeless ! He realized he had not truly renounced his life as a mouse  --  he had only put it off . But he could not put it off . His mouse existence would not wait for him . What he had vaguely formulated while helping Robin with her algebra now presented itself to him with the clarity of a judicial sentence : he was losing his time as a mouse ! Even as he sat here on the bench another life was going inexorably on within him . The mouse in him  --  like all creatures , was growing , towards death . His four experiences had been only brief , kaleidoscopic glimpses , rites of passage in time  --  time wildly accelerated . So what if he waited too long and then tried to get back  --  he knew he would try to get back  --  and found he was a long-dead mouse ? His stomach turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At best , Marian would wake up to a dry little skeleton on the pillowcase ; at worst , to a human vegetable beside her  --  he would be a vegetable for Marian and the girls for the long unthinkable years left to him as a man .... Abruptly , he hailed a cab and directed the driver to the Public Library . There , in the cathedral-like Catalogue Room , he first , in his urgency , looked under " Titles , " and found himself staring at Of Mice and Men , crazily believing , for a moment , that someone else had had his problem . He shook his head and moved over to " Subjects . " He found what he was looking for in Raising Small Animals for Pleasure and Profit . Young mice are born naked with their eyes closed . They grow rapidly and begin to eat solid food at two to three weeks of age . They attain sexual maturity at two to three months . Then , there it was : The life span of a mouse is three to five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet in his hands as if it were a sacred text . So he did have some time . His rapid development would now ease off , perhaps it had caught up with him , and he would be in his prime for a long " time " ... besides , time was so relative , he knew that now . His life as a mouse would seem as long as his life as a man .... The glow from the mousehole enveloped him as he read on with the intentness and reverence he had never brought to any printed words before .... The Mouse ( family Muridae ) is thought to have had its ancient origin in Asia and has spread astonishing fecundity . In ideal circumstances , one male mouse can sire 3,000 of its species in a year . And That mice do have singing ability should not be dismissed as an old wives ' tale . What they make is a high wiry trill which is mostly supersonic .

He went into his office , saying he did not want to be disturbed on any account . At his desk he surrounded himself with his personal files , grateful that as a lawyer he had always kept his affairs in order . There would be more than enough for Marian to live on . And the girls could go to college  --  they could become doctors or lawyers or captains of industry .... Staring out of the window , he felt good about it all . It was not as if he were deserting them . He was sparing them . There was a slight flaw in his logic . After all , he should be able to stop turning himself into a mouse just as some people could stop smoking or drinking if they absolutely had to  --  but ... But . He did not want to .

He thought of Marian , her straightforward brown eyes , her slender organized hands ... yes , some mystery might do her good . And the girls ? He had never lied to them . There had never been anything to lie about . " My dearest Hilary , Barbara , and Robin ... " How could he even begin to explain ? He could n't even explain it to himself . Best to leave it .

The others had gone through it , to Granola . Ladened with his packages , he let himself into the apartment , lino the deep quiet of meditation , and began to prepare the meal . Candles on the table , real napkins for a change . As he opened the oven door to put the tournedos in for broiling , he tried not to think about what lay behind the stove .... And then he was seated at the table with his family . His dinner seemed to assuage the usual feelings , and it had been a good day for everybody ; Robin had gotten a B in her algebra , Barbara 's team had won , and Hilary had met a wonderful boy who , he gathered from her description , treated her just like a boy . And Marian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her across the candlelight . She was a stunning woman , really . And the girls . Leaning his elbows on the table , he looked from one to the other .

Ile felt a DECEMBER 1976 " You are all so beautiful , " he said . And they were , as they turned their intelligent faces toward him , with Marian 's high cheekbones , and his dark level eyebrows , which , on them , gave them a look of lovely disdain . " So beautiful ... " " Oh , daddy , " Hilary said . But she looked pleased . HAT NIGHT IN BED he made Marian as happy as he possibly could . When he was certain she was asleep , he got out of bed and went to the window , gently drawing the curtains apart . He looked down into the park . " Goodbye , " he said . Then , idiotically , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be done . " For really , the matter did seem out of his hands . He would never worry like a man again . He was losing his life in order to gain it  --  suddenly all of the spiritual insights of both East and West made sense . There was no need to lie down beside Marian . He took off his pajamas , folded them carefully and put them at the foot of the bed , and lay down on the floor in the pool of moonlight . Closing his eyes , he summoned his spurious mantra . Shiva Shiva A terrible pain cut through him . He found he was licking a great gash in his shoulder . His fur was matted , the flesh of a severed muscle was bulging out of the wound , and under that the white glistening of bone . Something had gone wrong . Obviously he had been in a fight during the day  --  perhaps even while he had been sitting in the park . But he felt strangely calm ; it did not matter . Nothing was perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal . Even the pain did not matter . All that mattered was to get to the hole . He dragged himself down the endless hallway , across the checkered linoleum . The stove was like a huge white cliff shining and beckoning to him , and even from a distance came the clean odor of sanctity  --  a great clear gust of primal fresh air . Exultantly , he dragged himself under the stove , pushing his way through dust , to the hole . The radiance from it reached out to him and then , even wounded and faint , he possessed the glow , the strength , steadiness , power , the purity of intention . Between his rear legs he bore his destiny like a golden chalice . Elongating his body , and flattening his long silvery whiskers against his jowls , he slithered clown into the hole  --  into the deep labyrinth of the endless possibilities of his race . 0
