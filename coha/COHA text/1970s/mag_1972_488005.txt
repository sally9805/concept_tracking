ToWard the end of September , polls and pollsters were the prime themes in the media . More recently , the center of interest has shifted to the " mood " of the electorate . It is as though the pundits , columnists and commentators have been so deeply puzzled  --  and distressed  --  by the polls that they have turned from statistics to subjective introspection . Interpreting the " mood " of a nation as large and varied as ours is a great journalistic sport , and we have all enjoyed it from time to time . It is generally a harmless sport , but a batch of recent interpretations of the prevailing " mood , " based on poll data , conveys a deplorable view of the American electorate . What emerges , as James Wechsler points out in a shrewd column in the New York Post , is a stereotype of " the dominant American " ? fearful , selfish , unmoved by scandal , uninterested in issues , bored with politicians and cool to the candidates . In some instances the interpretation seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ease with which a $75 billion defense appropriation  --  the largest since World War II ? was passed by a 70-to-5 vote in the Senate , Senator Mansfield said : " I do n't know what it is going to take to wake this country up , " while his colleague Senator Fulbright sadly observed : " I suppose people can become accustomed to anything , including the killing of other humans . " Taking note of the fact that a Harris poll shows 55 per cent approval for the bombing of North Vietnam as against 32 per cent opposed , The New Yorker ( September 23 ) comments : " Day by day , we are turning into monsters . For a hundred reasons , and for no reason whatever , we are blowing men , women and children to bits with our bombs , and we ca n't feel a thing . " If America , with a population six times that of the two Vietnams , had been punished as we have punished them these last six months , reports Peter R. Kann in The Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 2 million Americans dead and wounded ? and 6 million homeless . About that we would not be apathetic . But does it follow that we are " monsters " ? Or stated another way , how much truth is there in the " dominant American " stereotype as projected by " mood " analysts who get their data from the polls ? Patently the electorate is not indifferent . The survey made by The Washington Post in the ten largest states concludes that : " Virtually every voter is concerned about virtually all the problems . They just do not have much hope that everything will be resolved immediately . " The contradictions inherent in our economic system , reflected in the contradictory attitudes of politicians of both parties , present voters with what they regard as unhappy options . Senator McGovern would slash defense spending  --  it needs slashing  --  but his own party is obviously unwilling to back Lim up on this issue , which he was initially able to develop because he came from South Dakota - where defense spending is not vital to the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most ofthe " doves " lined up to help Senators Magnusson , Jackson and Symington with their " special " problems . The Senate committee restored the $127-million cut in the House bill for the purchase of three 747 jumbo jets ( made by Boeing ) to be used as airborne command posts by the President and his military commanders in case of war . The committee also restored $101 million for the purchase of thirty F-15s , a new Air Force fighter produced by McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis . Given such an exhibition of bipartisan voting behavior , it well may be that skepticism , not apathy , underlies the " mood " of the electorate on this and many related issues . At the same time , the Democratic contenders have not zeroed in on the economic or pocketbook - issues in a meaningful way . In this area voters are by no means completely bemused by the sophistries of the Nixon Administration . The Washington Post survey shows that voters are deeply concerned about the economy . " Strong complaints were voiced about jobs , inflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an economic squeeze that , while it may vary in intensity at different levels , is nearly universal . Inflation is a nagging daily ache which will not go away . But it has not been stressed , with dramatic emphasis , by the Democratic contenders . The President blandly assures us that he will not ask for new taxes  --  not , that is , unless Congress increases spending . He also tells us that he has no intention of pushing the value added tax in 1973 . This sounds like good news , but it is clear , most economists agree , that taxes will be increased . Moreover , the Administration links its promise not to ask for more taxes with Congressional approval of the $250-billion ceiling on federal spending . This measure , it should be noted , would give the President unlimited authority to cut in whatever programs he chooses in order to get outlays down to the $250-billion figure . He will use this authority , if it is given to him , as the equivalent of a line-veto and social programs will suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big middle sector of the American economy that has gone on for the last four years will be as nothing to what may be anticipated if the Administration is given another four-year term . This issue has not been hammered home by the Democrats . Paradoxically , the Democrats have so many good issues ( see article p. 325 this issue ) that they tend to exploit all of them separately and thereby fail to make a central coherent case against the Administration that can be related to the basic concerns and interests of a majority of the electorate . As many voters see it , the war must be ending because everyone seems to be opposed to it . The clever tactics of the Administration ? Kissinger 's travels alternating with denials by Ron Ziegler that anything special is cooking ? have , temporarily at least , had a soothing effect . Stressing the moral aspect of the war , as Senator McGovern has been doing , is one way to counter this complacency . But Prof. Howard Schuman of the University of Michigan has shown that opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on moral grounds ; the public at large began to oppose it after the January 1968 Tet offensive , because it seemed apparent that we were not winning it . The appeal to this larger element of the opposition should be on grounds that do not arouse guilt feelings in them but that make sense in terms of such basic concerns as taxes , inflation and the state of the economy . So what the " mood " seems to reflect is an electorate torn in different directions , extremely skeptical of the political leadership of both parties as shown by the behavior of Congress ( Southern Democrats continue to provide critically important support to the Administration on key issues , including the failure to investigate the Watergate affair ) and experiencing difficulty in relating their concerns and interests to the statements of either party . But voters this year have shown themselves to be extremely independent and contradictory  --  as well they might be , considering the contradictions they face  --  and , in the words of The Washington Post survey , " highly volatile and given to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing to take place . CAREY MCWILLIAMS Prisoners and Politics From the time it took office to the present , the Nixon Administration has given political advantage precedence over everything else , and the return of the three prisoners of war held by Hanoi was no exception . Hanoi , of course , was similarly using the men for its political objectives and it was successful  --  the gesture put the war back on Page 1 . On the American side , the operation achieved a new high in meanness . As public relations , it was plain stupid . The best analysis of the Administration 's motivation is provided by Newsweek ( October 9 ) : The President 's decision to make the release of the prisoners the linchpin of American policy on Vietnam was prompted by more than his desire to win the men 's freedom . Mr. Nixon was elected on a pledge to end the war , but he has been unable to do so after nearly a full term in office . . . . He has steadfastly refused to withdraw U.S. support from the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanoi says is essential to end the war . That being the case , Mr. Nixon needed a domestically persuasive rationale for the continued American involvement in Indochina  --  and the continued loss of American lives . The POWs became that rationale . But not without cost to the Administration . The North Vietnamese released the three men to the Committee of Liaison with Families of Service Men Detained in North Vietnam . The committee , headed by Mrs. Cora Weiss and David Dellinger , is an anti-war group and a thorn in the Administration 's side . On their trip to Hanoi to receive the prisoners , Mrs. Weiss and Dellinger were accompanied by Yale Chaplain William Sloane Coffin , Jr. , and Richard Falk , professor of International Law at Princeton . The prisoners Hanoi was freeing were Air Force Maj. Edward Elias , Navy , Lieut . Markham L. Gartley and Navy Lieut. ( j.g . ) Norris Charles . Charles 's wife and Gartley 's mother were also in the party . The Administration made a pretense of being glad to have the men back , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It conflicted with Mr. Nixon 's worldwide ballyhoo , set in motion to throw blame for the continuing war on the North Vietnamese , because they would not release the prisoners before a cease-fire or settlement , although never , in the entire history of warTHE NATION/October 16 , 1972 fare , have prisoners been released by either side until the war was brought to an end . Predictably , a struggle ensued over the three returning Americans . To minimize any criticism the prisoners might voice against the continuation of the war , and to prevent them from declaring that they had been as well treated in captivity as could be expected , the U.S. Government seems to have planned to take them away from the Committee of Liaison in Vientiane . However , the party changed to the Peking-Moscow-Copenhagen route , and the Administration was thrown into confusion . First it took a tough stand ? Secretary Laird did not rule out court-martial proceedings or other disciplinary measures . But as the press began to carry the story in a big way , harshness was discarded in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bowels of compassion and would take into account the sufferings of the returning men . Nevertheless , it was made plain that they were still members of the armed forces , and at Copenhagen a Major named Ronald Walker boarded the SAS 747 , introduced himself as the " senior military representative present " and ordered the men to don specially tailored uniforms , correct down to the last ribbon , so that they could land at Kennedy International Airport in proper attire . Other arrangements included quick separation of the three from the Committee of Liaison and each from the others ; above all , they were not to Talk to relatives of prisoners who were still in North Vietnam . Despite the tears of Mrs. Gartley , her son was whisked to nearby St. Alban 's Hospital for physical examination and " debriefing . " The Charles family raised a fuss and they were allowed an hour and a half with the lieutenant at the International Hotel at the airport . Elias is a special case . He intends to make the Air Force his career and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he testified , as did the other two , that the treatment of prisoners is generally humane : the horror stories that have t been circulated appear to have no basis in fact . All of the released men are concerned about their comrades who remain in captivity . The greatest danger , of course , is that one of the bombs with which the U.S. Navy and Air Force are practicing their art will fall on a POW camp . Presumably we know the location of these camps , but , judging by the controversy over bombing of the dikes , no installation in North Vietnam is safe , Since President Nixon ordered the renewal of systematic bombing of North Vietnam , fifty GIs  --  chiefly airmen  --  have been reported captured , and 114 others are listed as missing . While wringing his hands over the POWs , Mr. Nixon is augmenting their numbers . He has not communicated with the released flyers in any way . Why No Peace ? The men most responsible for the continuing carnage in Indochina are Nixon , Kissinger and Nguyen Van Thieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 108-page pamphlet , " Aid to Thieu , " by Le Anh Tu and Marilyn McNabb of the American Friends Service Committee , 112 South 16 Street , Philadelphia 19102 . Backed by 273 references and notes , the pamphlet is a calm account of tyranny , oppression and mass murder , carried on with vast amounts of American money , military aid and the participation of the CIA . The last paragraph of the text reads : The demand that the U.S. cease its aid to Thieu is reasonable from the point of view of Vietnamese who want peace and national independence . It is imperative from the point of view of Americans who want to bring this country 's expensive and bloody adventure in Indochina to an end . The Nixon Administration locked itself into an alliance with Thieu at a time when that seemed the only alternative to military defeat . With his four " no 's , " Thieu is now the principal obstacle to a negotiated peace . Getting rid of him is the problem of Nixon and Kissinger . If they persist in keeping Thieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are determined to win the war militarily , regardless of the moral and material consequences to the American and Indochinese people . The Great Grain Robbery That is what it has been called and that is what it looks like . A sidelight is- the quality and limitations of television reporting . How many of the millions who listened to Walter Cronkite 's TV program on the grain sales to the Soviet Union really assimilated its meaning ? Cronkite did his usual professional job  --  the investigation was thorough and the facts were presented clearly and in logical order . But it is a story more suitable for reading than viewing . The story begins with the fact that the Soviet Union was short of the hard red wheat of which the United States is a principal source . The shortage was of potentially disastrous proportions , but initially no one knew its true extent except the top agricultural authorities . Later American grain dealers learned what was up , but the last to know were the American wheat growers . So farmers in the Southwest ? Texas , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price was $1.30 to $1.40 a bushel ? it later went to $2.06 . Not only were they not told , what was in prospect but the information they received was wrong : yes , there would be Russian purchases but there was little chance that the price would soar . As late as mid-August , when the Department did know the full extent of the Soviet shortages , a report detailing the facts was suppressed . The matter was discussed at the May summit talks in Moscow . On July 8 the President announced that the way was now open for Russian purchases , but as late as July 18 the extent of the purchases was minimized : perhaps 100 million bushels . Actually , by that time the six big grain exporters had sold 267 million bushels and were on their way to 419 million bushels . The exporters knew what they needed to know , as the farmers did not . J. W. Anderson , in The Washington Post , explains several facets of this situation . To say that a wheat exporter has sold , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done is sign a contract to deliver that quantity of wheat , at a price not publicly disclosed , at specified points on dates over the months to come . But the exporter has n't got the wheat , and must buy it to fulfill his contract . He must buy as quietly and unobtrusively as possible , forestalling as far as possible the inevitable rise in prices . He buys where he can  --  from elevator operators , from cooperatives , from Agriculture Department stocks , from other dealers who may be long on wheat while he is short . Six big exporters handle something like 90 per cent of overseas grain sales . Theirs is the world , Anderson writes , of " superb channels of private intelligence , good connections with officials in many governments , " a world in which the actors are disinclined to disclose prices and profits . There is nothing wrong with sales of grain or other foodstuffs to the Soviet Union or China or any other country . What is wrong is the manipulation that goes on , the windfalls that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxpayers ' and consumers ' pockets . By law , a subsidy must be paid when the domestic price of wheat is higher than the world price . At the time the deals with Russia were being made there was little difference between the ? two , and no occasion for a subsidy . But by July 12 the difference was around 130 a bushel , and the domestic price  --  and the subsidy  --  were soaring . The Administration was finally forced to call a halt : on August 25 , it announced it was abandoning its commitment to maintain a stable export price . By that time , the Russians had stopped buying , but on August 24 the Department of Agriculture phoned a select list of exporters to apprise them of the change in policy . The subsidy is determined by the date on which a sale is registered , not the date on which the contract was signed . The six big exporters had been holding backon registration as long as possible so as to reap , one might say , as large a subsidy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bushel . That was a golden week . At the end of it , 212 million bushels were registered at a 47.50 subsidy . The results , briefly summarized , are about $100 million extracted from the American taxpayer ; a reduction in the surplus that may cost American farmers $69 million or more next year ; a rise in the price of wheat , and a consequent rise in the price of bread for the housewife . It may all be perfectly legal under existing law , but that suggests there is something wrong with the law . And may there not be a conflict of interest in the case of Clarence D. Palmby , who until last June was Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and left the Department on June 12 to become vice president of the Continental Grain Company ? Mr. Palmby was a prominent member of the delegation which accompanied Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz to Moscow for preliminary discussions of credit terms for possible ( but probable ) grain purchases by the Russians . Mr. Palmby was making $38,000 a year at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $100,000 , on which he can afford an apartment on Sutton Place in New York in the $90,000 to $100,000 range . Secretary Butz sturdily defends his former aide from any charge of wrongdoing , but now concedes that there may have been an " appearance " of wrongdoing . To an outsider , it seems more than a shadow . One hopes that the House Agriculture subcommittee will persist in its attempt to pry out the facts .
