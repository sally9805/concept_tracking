Physicians smiled in disbelief a decade ago when Cancer Researcher Dr. John Higginson of the World Health Organization suggested that as many as 80% of all cancers were caused by agents in the environment . But no one is scoffing any more . The National Cancer Institute has published charts showing those areas of the country with the highest death rates from lung , liver and bladder cancer ( see map ) ; these areas also happen to have chemical plants-and chemical pollution . The obvious conclusion : Americans-and others elsewhere round the world-are increasingly filling their environment with chemicals that are not only harmful but may even be lethal . <P> Perfected Test . Medical scientists have been trying for decades to identify those chemicals that are carcinogenic . Their task is not easy . Throughout his evolution , man has been exposed to literally millions of chemical compounds ; more recently , he has encountered synthetic compounds that did not even exist a generation or even a few years ago . Testing these compounds for ability to cause cancer currently requires extensive animal studies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there may be a way to speed up the search . In a report to the Environmental Protection Agency last week , Biologist Barry Commoner , who heads the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at St. Louis ' Washington University , announced that he had perfected a test that can not only identify possible carcinogens , but may also be able to pick out those individuals most likely to develop cancer as a result of exposure to them . <P> Commoner 's work relies heavily upon a test devised by Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley . Ames found that certain carcinogens were capable of causing mutations in bacteria . This suggested to Ames the possibility of using mutagenicity , the ability to cause mutations , which can be determined simply and quickly , as a test for carcinogenicity . <P> To determine the correlation , Commoner and his Washington University colleagues tested 92 chemical compounds on strains of the common bacteria Salmonella typhimurium , developed by Ames . Each compound was made up in three different concentrations and mixed with preparations made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stomach , lung , spleen and blood ) ; each of the mixtures was then added to culture dishes containing the Salmonella . <P> The results were dramatic . Of the 50 compounds that were known to be noncarcinogenic , only one , which happened to be a close chemical relative of a known carcinogen , caused the bacteria to mutate at a significant rate . Of the 42 other compounds , all known carcinogens , all but seven induced bacterial mutations by themselves . When the urine of rats that had been fed to three of the remaining compounds was placed in the culture dishes , it too produced mutations , suggesting that the chemicals , which may not cause cancer directly , are metabolized in the body into substances that do . With a slight change in the test method , three other compounds also proved mutagenic.
