The Arms Burden <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> I feel your article " Arming for the 21st Century " May 23 came at an appropriate time . With the Russians arming to the teeth , it would be foolish of us not to take countermeasures . I hope we will continue to develop our conventional arms and also the more sophisticated ones , like the Bl . It will be an expensive burden , but worth it . <P> <P> Dennis Beavers Cozad , Neb . <P> <P> How tragic that your cover story on defense , titled " Arming for the 21st Century , " could not be titled , " Disarming for the 21st Century . " <P> <P> Glenna Brink Modesto , Calif . <P> <P> Your cover story on defense was embarrassingly one-sided . You could n't have done a better job if you had been awarded a contract by the Department of Defense to prepare a public relations brochure to sell defense programs . <P> <P> Joseph A. Pegnato Phoenix , Ariz . <P> <P> Nowhere in Defense Secretary Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I feel the Pentagon needs most-a healthy dose of competition , a halt to cost overruns and an end to the revolving-door movement of executives between the Pentagon and defense contractors . <P> For instance , in 1976 only 8% of the Pentagon 's procurement dollars were awarded through competitive bidding . However , a 1973 Senate study reviewed 21 sophisticated weapons systems and found that competition reduced costs by an average of more than 50% . <P> Some systems rated as " complex " and bought without competitive bids included faucet handles , window screens , recording tape , oil filters and lawnmowers . As a GAO study noted , lower prices could often be found just by looking in the Yellow Pages . <P> Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Senator , Ohio Washington , D.C. <P> It is unfortunate that we devote so much time and energy to systems for killing people , but until the Russian leaders learn to respect not power but our right to live in peace , we really have no choice . <P> Richard Sybert Honolulu <P> Tragically , we are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these awesome and expensive systems . But if we have them as part of our shield , we will probably never have to use them in anger . <P> Robert K. Dornan , U.S. Representative 27th District , Calif . Washington , D.C. <P> One Trident sub costs $949 million . Our new high school cost $3 million . Is a sub worth 316.33 schools ? <P> Richard W. Peck Pine Plains , N. Y. <P> <P> Lindbergh : Still a Hero <P> I disagree with Lance Morrow 's statement , " Lindbergh is more an item of receding Americana than a hero who engages the popular imagination " May 23 . To me , Lindbergh is still very much a hero and always will be . <P> Robert C. Johnson Winchester , Mass . <P> Someone like Lindbergh who performed a daredevil stunt for public attention and financial gain does not , in my opinion , deserve the title of hero . <P> Joel G.
