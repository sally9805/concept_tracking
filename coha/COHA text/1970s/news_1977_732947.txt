txt Why has President Carter escalated from " modest " to " substantial " the sacrifices Americans will be called on to make to solve the energy crisis ? " The President , " says one official , " may have come to realize that the problem is much more serious than it first appdared to be ? and that strict conservation is the only way out . " " Even though more natural gas is coming through the lines , " he adds , " it 's on a loan basis and must be replaced this summer . " Americans , reports the Federal Energy Administration ( FEA ) , for the first time in their history are burning more than 20 million barrels of oil daily . Roughly half that amount comes from overseas . Thus Mr. Carter 's top energy aides ? including James R. Schlesinger and Federal Energy Administrator John O'Leary ? are warning that next winter 's gas shortage and dependence on foreign oil could be worse , unless Americans buckle down to real conservation . In other words , more details on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President between Feb. 2 ? when , in his fireside chat , he described the needed sacrifices as " modest " ? and Feb. 8 , when he stressed the word " substantial . " ? When his " comprehensive " energy policy is unveiled in late April , said Mr. Carter , " it will obviously engender a great deal of debate . It 's going to require Substantial sacrifices on the part of the American people . " UPI photo // From page-1-*U.S. energy cutbacks ahead Meanwhile , despite burgeoning fuel and other costs due to the weather , the Carter White House ? struggling to keep this year 's budget deficit below $70 billion ? does not plan to boost its economic stimulus package . " When we start moving upward on the package , " budget director Bert Lance told reporters at breakfast , " you move into related concerns about the deficit . " As presented to Congress , the two-year $31.2 billion stimulus package entails $15.5 billion worth of spending this fiscal , 1977 , year ? swelling the anticipated deficit to " $69-to-$70 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then will Americans cope with the extra costs thrust upon them by the weather crisis , including billions of dollars of higher fuel bills and ? for thousands of workers ? lost wages ? More federal spending may well be needed , concedes Mr. Lance . But this " ought not to be part of the stimulus package . It should be a separate , distinct program . " He agrees that extra spending would balloon the deficit in either case ? whether weather-related funds are lumped into the stimulus package or treated separately . But Mr. Lance and the President want to make a point . It is that some Americans are not affected by higher weather costs . Special help , therefore , should be channeled to those in need , not simply tacked onto the stimulus package ? which applies to everyone . " The stimulus package , " said the budget director , " was drawn to meet a particular situation , before the weather Struck . " That package , in the White House view , pushed the deficit as high as it should go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blur the issue of fiscal responsibility . If more spending . is required , said Mr. Lance , we want to be ' able to say ? " the weather has caused this . " Congress , or course , may reshape the stimulus package , with or without a weather supplement . " Drastic . changes " in his package , Mr. Carter warned . Feb. 8 , could cause him to veto the bill , though lie doubts this will occur . Totals of spending ? $15.5 billion this fiscal year , $15.7 billion next year ? and the " balance " of the . program between tax cuts and jobs-creating funds are both important , said Mr. Lance .
