txt The federal government obviously does n't want to see the economy suffer either a recession or more inflation . If there is a choice , however , federal officials lean heavily toward more inflation . That , at any rate , is the assessment of many private economists as they watch developments in Washington . " I think the government has given up on fighting inflation , " says William Wollman , economist for Argus Research Corp . Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester adds : " I 'm looking for an average inflation rate of around 55 a year for the next 10 years . It will be higher in some years and lower in others , but that 's the trend . " Few economists are willing to be as bold a ? Mr. Brunner and forecast inflation for the next decade . But a score of analysts interviewed by The Wall Street Journal do predict on the average that the consumer price index will rise by around 5% next year . A 5% rate of inflation would be a decline from current rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 8.7% in the second quarter of this year , and most economists expect the result this quarter to be about the same . But 5% would be almost twice the average annual rise for the two decades through 1972 . ( For details on other second quarter economic statistics , see story on page 3 . ) Phase 4 Is Cited As evidence that Washington is worrying less about inflation , the analysts cite officials ' statements on the new Phase 4 controls . " All the stress is on managing the program to avoid damage to the economy , " says one economist . " No one is making any fancy claims about keeping prices down . " Nixon administration officials insist that they have n't given up against inflation  --  but they have given up trying to predict what the rate will be for the rest of this year and next . The President 's Council of Economic Advisers , which officially forecast a 3% inflation rate for 1973 , has stopped making any more predictions . Herbert Stein , chairman of the council , argues that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year are " temporary " and abnormal . He says a period of " reasonable price stability " can be achieved , perhaps next year , if " prudent " fiscal and monetary policies are followed . Administration officials do hope that the federal budget will exert some restraint on inflation as the budget moves toward balance this fiscal year . But the narrowing of the budget deficit stems entirely from rising revenues ; federal spending keeps on going up . The inflation impact is the same whether the government or its citizens spend the money . A more nearly balanced budget will ease pressures on the Federal Reserve System , since it will have to worry less about the Treasury 's financing needs . Although the Fed does n't support the government securities market , it does try to make sure that the banks have enough money to handle new Treasury issues ? an inflation-abetting effort that can conflict with monetary policy aims . So far this year , though , the Fed has been pursuing a new policy . " In the future this may be remembered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says A. Gary Shilling , chief economist for the brokerage firm of White , Weld &; Co . " The Fed is trying to slow the economy by permitting ultra-high interest rates ? and at the same time avoid a recession by making sure that lots of money is available at the higher rates . " No Crunch in Sight In recent testimony before the Joint Congressional Economic Committee , Board Chairman Arthur Burns assured the legislators that the Federal Reserve wo n't engineer a new " credit crunch . " He defined a crunch as a situation in which the money supply does n't grow at all . That certainly has n't been the case lately . The money supply , consisting of currency and bank checking accounts , has grown at an annual rate of around 10% in the past three months . That compares with 8% for all 1972 , a rate that Fed officials concede was too fast . The economy nonetheless has been slowing down . The " real " gross national product ( which is measured in terms of 1958 dollars ) rose at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sharp drop from the super-fast 8.7% gain in the year 's first three months . But much of the slowdown stemmed from the fact that businessmen , operating at capacity or close to it , could n't keep pace with incoming orders . There is as yet no indication that high interest rates have done much to cool the economy . Banks ' loans to business are rising somewhat less swiftly than they were earlier this year , but the pace remains very fast . In the four months through July , business loans of the large banks that report weekly to the Fed grew at an annual rate of 25% . Further Rise in Prime Rate Seen " High interest rates do n't curb borrowers because they expect rates to go even higher later on , " says Norman Robertson , chief economist of Pittsburgh 's Mellon Bank . The banks last week raised their prime rate , the fee they charge their best-rated borrowers , to 9Y4% , a record . But many economists think the prime will go up to at least ** in coming months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Federal Reserve officials have pleaded for more anti-inflation help from fiscal policy  --  such as tax increases . They also have been contending that this inflation is different from previous rounds . Chairman Burns told the Economic Committee that the continuing inflation has stemmed from factors that can not be controlled by monetary policy . Paul J. Markowski , chief economist of the brokerage firm of Laidlaw-Coggeshall Inc. , says the Fed must contend with numerous " leakages " in the monetary system . He notes , for instance , that the government tried to insulate housing against higher interest rates and tighter money . Federal agencies borrow funds in the market to channel into mortgages . " These activities , " Mr. Markowski says , " are inflationary since they keep up demand pressures ( for money ) , which are what the Fed is trying to reduce . " Commercial banks ' ability to raise funds by selling large certificates of deposit with no interest-rate ceiling has partly insulated them from the impact of Federal Reserve monetary policy . The Fed joined other regulatory agencies last month in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far seems to have aided commercial banks in attracting and holding funds but has pulled money out of savings banks and savings-and-loan associations , the chief providers of home-mortgage credit . Most economists , however , stress that the - Federal Reserve still can curb the expansion of bank credit and the money supply-and thus inflation-if it is willing to pull enough reserves out of the banking system . Each bank must hold reserves equal to a specified percentage of its deposits ; a reduction in reserves cuts a bank 's ability to lend and create new deposits . The Fed , for instance , can pull reserves out of the system by selling Treasury securities , which brings money into the Treasury and out of the banks . The Fed , of course , is trying to avoid pressures severe enough to cause a credit crunch . How will its experiment come out ? " No one will know for the next three to six months , " says Michael Evans , president of the economic consulting firm of Chase Econometrics . " The system got itself into its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply earlier and by suppressing interest rates early this year , " he contends . " Now that we 're where we are , we might as well see whether the Fed can make its plan work . " Mr. Evans thinks the Federal Reserve will succeed , at least in the sense of getting through 1974 without an official recession . Recessions are designated " official " by the National Bureau of Economic Research . They usually volve at least two consecutive quarters of declines in constant-dollar gross national product , but the bureau uses more sophisticated criteria . A Wall Street Journal poll of a score of economists finds only seven forecasting an official recession next year , although all of the group expect a sharp decline in business activity . For the year as a whole , the analysts on the average see real GNP rising by slightly less than 2% . One factor in the no-recession forecast is that businessmen seem to have their inventories under control . As sales slow , stocks usu4- ally pile up , and this leads to sharp cutbacks in production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they will continue to do so , " says Morris Cohen , economist for the investment counseling firm of Schroder Naess &; Thomas . " They 're expensive to finance , and the continuing uncertainty has made businessmen cautious about building them up . " Most economists now are still looking for interest rates to peak before the end of 1973 . But . Mr. Shilling cautions : " When we have a peak in interest rates , someone has to get burned  --  really priced out of the market . So far everyone seems to think that it 's business as usual . " The situation is in fact unusual , and analysts say the public had better start adapting : " Businessmen and investors , " says Argus Research , " must adjust their decision-making and portfolio policies to a situation in which the inflation rate will come in at something like 5% to 51h% for some years to come . " " If there are signs that a real slowdown is on next year , " Mr. Robertson says , " the dan ; ger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate still is high . If we start our economy each time at a higher inflation level , you raise doubts as to whether we will ever be able to regain price stability . " The average inflation rate might go on moving higher and higher . You 've got to remember that inflation is a dynamic force . It just does n't settle at 3% or 4%. "
