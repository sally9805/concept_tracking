Three months after the death of Hubert Humphrey , his family has still not figured out what to do with the thousands of things that people sent him over the past 35 years . Stored in a musty basement of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul are plaster busts of Humphrey and his wife Muriel , a doll made of apples and holding a copy of the Senate rules , a container of holy water from Lourdes , an eight-inch-wide cookie made of Rice Krispies and baked in the shape of a maple leaf , four whips ( sent to him when he was Senate whip ) , a paint-by-number picture of Rin Tin Tin , and an egg laid by a hen on the day a man first walked on the moon . Elizabeth Knight of the historical society , who is attempting to make an inventory of the entire collection , says she has no idea how many items there are or what their value might be .                  @ @ @
