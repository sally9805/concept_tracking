A patch of asphalt in the street , not bulging high enough to cause a car going over to bump , marks the location of death . Standing on it , Irwin M. Urling checks his watch  --  it is a minute or two before ten in the morning  --  and looks at his shadow in the street . It slants forward and somewhat to the left . " I 'm looking north , " says Urling , and makes a note of it . He is a portly man of sixty-two , dressed in a rumpled gray suit , worn shoes , a raincoat , and a battered hat whose wide brim has been out of style for most of a generation . But the hat has done good service against sun and rain , and Urling 's duties do not call for elegance . If anything , the rumpled look serves him better . People are less on guard with him . They talk more . Now he stands at attention : heels together , shoulders relaxed , belly comfortably extended . He is concentrating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , taking his time , occupies the middle of the street . If a car came along he would give way , but slowly , so as not to blur the mental fix he is carefully achieving . Now he has it . Three stately paces to the curb and feet together , he lifts a folded sheet of paper up close , very close , to his straining eyes . With a ballpoint pen he draws a few lines , a crude map ( he will refine it later ) of the intersection of Lowrie and Gardner Streets in the Troy Hill section of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . One corner he labels " school , " and the others " store , " " gas station , " and " funeral home . " He draws a tiny rectangle on Lowrie for the underground vault twenty feet west of Gardner and six feet away from the north curb , where on November 17 , 1971 , six employees of a local gas utility met a swift , suffocating death . " They want everything definitely located , " Urling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission , from which agency he and five other special agents earn their living by traveling the continent in search of the truth about reported acts of rescue . " We live in a heroic age , " Andrew Carnegie wrote in a Deed of Trust to the commission he founded in 1904 . In retirement at age sixty-eight the little Scot was as energetically giving away as he had earlier been accumulating his millions . His shining causes were education and peace . It exasperated him that military courage , necessarily spreading death and ruin , should monopolize public glory and the emulation of youth . The worst sort of example ! Why not equal or greater honor to those who save life at risk of their own ? ? and aid to the widows and orphans of these unsung ? The heroic deaths of two rescuers in a 1904 coal mine disaster were the direct spur to Carnegie 's creation of a " hero fund . " But the idea of honoring , and more important , of financially aiding , heroes of peace had been turning over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have long felt , " he wrote , " that the heroes and those dependent upon them should be freed from pecuniary cares resulting from their heroism , and , as a fund for this purpose , I have transferred to the Commission five million dollars of First Collateral Five Per Cent Bonds of the United States Steel Corporation , the proceeds to be used as follows .... " More than 53,000 acts of rescue have been reported to the Commission in the seven decades since , and it has made over 6,000 awards for heroism . That is a greater number by far than the total of Congressional Medals of Honor bestowed over the same period in the nation 's wars , though the essential high qualification is the same : an act " above and beyond the call of duty . " From the very first , the Commission realized it could not depend on news accounts or hearsay but would have to perform its own painstaking investigation of reports of heroic deeds . " This is going to be a hard case to establish , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . His most obvious difficulty is that the six men are dead . It can never be known for certain whether those who tried to rescue others realized the risks they were taking . And this is of the essence . Blunderers who absently trip into death can not be heroes . Yet one-fifth of all Carnegie awards since 1904 ? some 1,200 ? have been made posthumously . For the Commission and its investigators death is a hindrance , not an insurmountable obstacle . Urling has been investigating rescues for a quarter of a century . He completes an average of fifty cases per year . From these he then submits perhaps thirty-five for an award , and the Commission may approve thirty-one . The final decision is not his . That is made in a comfortable , but hardly lavish , suite on the nineteenth floor of an office building in downtown Pittsburgh . The Commission always has sat in the city where Carnegie made his fortune . Its membership has turned over many times since 1904 ; but its spirit and style are virtually unaltered ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. economy have increased the Fund 's endowment to about $14 million ) . The Commission still consists of twenty men of a certain standing in the city of steel : business executives , lawyers , physicians , other professionals . Every two months they gather around a long table in a carpeted room , away from the stress of the events they must judge , with even the noises of the city muted far below . They consult official reports prepared for their eyes alone , gravely discuss questions of risk and mysteries of motive ; and decide whether at such a time and place , such a man , woman , or child has performed a deed of the commendable sort their founder had in mind . If so , some weeks later the hero or his next of kin will receive a medal , three inches in diameter , most often cast in bronze , with an engraved inscription concisely describing the deed . Approximately 10 percent of heroes honored over the years have received medals in silver for special valor . Nineteen gold medals also have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won one . The Commission nowadays reserves gold for those rare occasions when great numbers of people , entire communities , are caught up in the spirit of mutual help so that individual acts merge into a sort of symphony of heroism . Thus , a specially mounted gold medal went to the doctors , mine officials , and numerous volunteers who , toiling for nine days in constant danger , at last rescued 99 of 174 coal miners trapped below ground in October , 1958 , at Springhill , Nova Scotia . Urling has done his homework on the Troy Hill case . From correspondence and newpaper files he has copied names and addresses of everyone supposedly involved . He knows the rough outline of what happened . Gas was leaking into a manhole in Lowrie Street . One man was pulled out , but two were still down there . Four others jumped in to save them . And all six died . The first name on the investigator 's list is that of the woman who gave the alarm . Mrs. Helen Flack operates the Hilltop Confectionery on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interior seems dark , and it takes a moment for the eyes to adjust to a maze of candy and magazine racks , grocery shelves , a luncheon counter , and pinball machines . Urling removes his hat respectfully but he is in no hurry to identify himself . He takes a seat at the counter . A young woman in blue jeans brings his cup of coffee . He asks , " Would you be Mrs. Flack ? " She is a blonde with steel-rimmed glasses . Her shirttails are out and her lower lip has a saucy curl . " Miss Flack , " she says , " I do n't want to be Missus . " " You will be , " Urling easily remarks . " Not me , " she says , but her smile is a sign that the contrary view does not offend her . Urling had hoped to see Missus Flack , he explains , to talk over the gas accident of the previous autumn . " My mother saw everything that happened , " Miss Flack unhesitatingly volunteers , and Urling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants are dead , someone who " saw everything " could be an invaluable witness . Unfortunately , Mrs. Flack has left the premises on business . She will not be back till after noon . The investigator sighs . Normally he would have telephoned to make certain she would be there . ( He almost never writes ahead , however . Too much notice that a Carnegie agent is en route can distort the case . Witnesses and rescuers might " rehearse " and invent details they do not really recall . ) " Well , " says Urling , getting up , " we must certainly come hack and talk to your mother . " An hour later in the corridor of a fire station he is interviewing Joseph E. Meier , a lanky , solemn fireman , age thirty-seven . " We got a call there was a man in a hole , " Meier is saying . " When we got there , there was six of them in the hole . From what I understand , they were working and one got sick and came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This testimony is after the fact , of course . Urling merely listens with his head cocked to one side , his pen and notepaper motionless in his hands behind his back . " Could you smell gas ? " he inquires . " Oh yeah , " says the fireman , smiling at the seeming naivete of this . From Urling 's point of view . however , if gas could not be smelled , it could reflect on whether the would-be rescuers knew the risks they were taking . " We had to use air-packs to go down in there , " says Meier . " I helped pass two bodies up . " " Flow much space was down there ? " Spreading his arms , the fireman suggests an area about six feet square and eight feet deep . " How were the men lying ? " " Every which way , " says Meier . He holds out two fingers of his left hand , crosses them with two of his right . " In a pile . " " Were any of them ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emer-gency ? " Meier shakes his head . " 1 could n't see any . " This discussion has been not unuseful to the Carnegie agent , but the official fire department report is essential . At the fire station , in Battalion Chief Harris 's office , there arc piles of forms stacked up on the desk and even on the cot where Harris might catch a nap . " The curse of the day , " Urling remarks , " is paperwork . " The chief accepts this sympathy with a solemn smile . He is a dark , powerfully built man with a tattoo on his forearm . The walls of his office are decorated with framed photographs of his sons in football uniform . " The call came in at 2:53 p.m. , " the chief says , referring to his official report . An " extremely dangerous gas condition " was the radio phrase . The first victim was being brought to the surface as Harris arrived at the scene . Gas was shooting out of the manhole with such force that dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked like a damned tornado , " says the chief . He and some of his men jumped into the hole with masks on . They stuffed a man 's jacket and some wet cloths into the six-inch main from which the gas was pouring , and finally they forced a metal seal into place , stopping the flow . Meanwhile , other firemen on the street were trying to resuscitate the victims by mouth-to-mouth respiration . The chief joined in this effort . " There was no response , " he says . Natural gas , methane , is not a " poison gas . " But it suffocates by replacing the oxygen in a person 's lungs . Harris remembers rust in the eyes of the dead men staring up at him as he tried to breathe life into their gaping mouths . And there was rust caked in the backs of their throats . " Should n't they have been wearing lifelines down there ? " Urling asks . " Lifelines are one thing , " says the chief , " but they did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't tell people what you want to say through a mask , never mind safety ! Utilities are always doing things like this  --  changing equipment ' on the fly , ' as they call it . " " On the fly ? " " Yes , instead of shutting off gas in the neighborhood  --  that way they 'd have to notify every home  --  they leave the gas on , remove the old valve , and shove in the new one real quick . On the fly . They do it all the time . " Harris angrily pulls off his glasses . " In this case , " he says , " the negligence was very evident to me . " Irwin Urling blows the air from his cheeks . Establishing negligence or culpability is not any part of his function , which differs from that of a detective . He is looking for the admirable , not the guilty , deed . But now the question of fault inevitably is going to shadow his work on this case , creating reticences where there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Urling has calls to make . A nearby YMCA offers as convenient a phork. booth as any . First , the gas company . It is cooperative . It arranges to have him meet the few surviving members of the Troy Hill manhole crew . But they are out on a job , will not return to the maintenance division shop till four o'clock in the afternoon . That is still two hours away . The widows of all the rescuers in the incident will have to be visited personally . The Hero Fund is not only , or even primarily , an agency for dispensing medals . Carnegie made it quite clear that , if financial need could be demonstrated , heroes and their dependents " should not suffer pecuniarily . " Thus , over the decades the Commission has paid more than $8 million in pensions to injured heroes and in monthly " contributions to the livelihood " of heroes ' widows , until they remarry . Another million has gone to further the education of awardees or their orphaned children ; and nearly $3 million in outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Carnegie 's view that true heroism could not be stimulated by hope of gain . In fact , persons who earn their living by protecting life  --  e.g. , police and firemen  --  usually are ineligible for Carnegie awards . So , too , are most members of the armed forces and those rescuers impelled by the spurs of kinship , like the father who rushes into a burning house for his own child . The fund exists for the selfless volunteer . With his spectacles up and his head bent close over the telephone hook , Urling notes the home phone numbers of the six dead men : William Letzkus , Albert Zeleny , Raymond Grundler ( the only one who was unmarried ) , Donald De Vine , Monroe Coleman , and their supervisor . Coleman and De Vine , so far as the investigator knows at this point , were the pair in the pit : victims rather than heroes . The others went in after them . The Commission can do nothing for victims ' families . It is necessary for Urling only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : confirm the victims ' names , addresses , ages , marital status . He will go to some lengths to do this without the painful necessity of visiting their homes , if he can avoid it . It is not unusual for him to encounter people who get exasperated at the amount of detail his reports require . But he pleads , " I have to fill in the blank somehow . " And such is the universal sympathy of those who have at times to face government forms and other niggling requirements of bureaucracy that they resignedly give him the data he wants . Anything but force a man to leave a form blank empty ! Classes are out at the high school across the intersection when Urling returns to Mrs. Helen Flack 's Hilltop Confectionery . Gray and plump in her loose housedress , the lady exudes an air of gruff maternity with the teenagers who fill her shop . Her voice is a husky whisper  --  from the cigarette in her fingers , or from years of yelling at kids ? ? I bought this pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her without the two cents for bottle deposit . " I 'm gon na drink it here , " he says . She smiles and chucks him under the chin , saying , " If you do n't , I 'll get ya tomorra . " But to the Carnegie investigator she is unable to confirm that she saw " everything . " She remembers a man running into her store crying , " Three of our guys are down in the hole ! Call the rescue squad ! " And she did . A minute later someone brought in the fellow who was still alive . She gave him a glass of ginger ale . But that was as close as she approached to the event itself . When she looked outside , saw firemen trying to revive , mouth-to-mouth , the dead men in the street , their eyes staring and their faces gray as iron , she felt woozy herself . " They worked and worked on them for hours , " she says but instantly withdraws the exaggeration , " . . oh , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do . " No , she did not know any of the victims . They had been working out side her store just that one day . A few of them had come in for a snack at one time or another . One nice fellow  --  she believed it was De Vine  --  had a cup of tea about 2:45 , not ten minutes before the accident , and a lady who happened to be in the store at the time remarked that she would be afraid to work with gas all the time . De Vine smiled . " What 's to be afraid of a little gas ? " he said . He was a veteran of twenty-three years with the gas company . " A few nights later . " Mrs. Flack says , " I heard crying outside . I went out and found this man kneeling by the spot . I said , Come on now , you do n't want to do that . ' You do n't understand , ' he said , he was my father . ' He named one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . ' " And Mrs. Flack , remembering this , has tears in her eyes . Riding toward the maintenance depot of the gas company en route to meet surviving members of the ill-fated gas crew , Urling recalls that this is not the first industrial case he has investigated in which the failure to employ fundamental safety equipment has caused what he calls needless death . " I 've known ' em to die while life jackets and masks were sitting on the back of a pickup truck six feet away , " he says to the driver . In the toolroom of the maintenance depot he catches up at last with a true eyewitness . Edward J. Klingensmith , thirty-one , is a friendly , red-haired man who wears his work pants slung low on his hips and his white cap at a jaunty angle . He is a welder . He was about to enter the manhole in Lowrie Street when the gas started pouring out . The job had looked routine enough : changing a worn valve in a six-inch main . The main itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident was the so-called back flow from the neighborhood tines off the main . In the manhole stood De Vine , Coleman , and John J. Ladasky , Jr . At street level , handing equipment into the hole , were Letzkus , Zeleny , Grundler , Herman Ranallo , Klingensmith , and the crew supervisor . The supervisor had telephoned one of his own superiors at the gas company , and the decision had been made to change the valve on the fly . De Vine and Coleman unbolted the old valve . Ladasky was standing ready to slip the new one into place . But when he tried to work it into position , for some reason the fit was n't right . Gas from the backflow began escaping . Up on the street , the supervisor ordered the men in the manhole to stuff the line temporarily with a wad of wet rags which were thrown into the pit . This was done ; yet enough gas escaped that Ladasky 's knees suddenly buckled . De Vine and Coleman caught him before he fell . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Coleman hauled Ladasky over to the ladder ; Ray Grundler came partway down to help him up , and Ranallo and Klingensmith hoisted him to street level . Unnoticed in the confusion , the wad of wet rags slipped out of the gas pipe and fell to the floor of the manhole . " I took Ladasky over to the side of the building to walk him around , " says Klingensmith . " You could see he was overcome by gas . By then you could smell a lot of gas . " And by then De Vine and Coleman had collapsed in the bottom of the pit  --  and Letzkus , Zeleny , and the crew boss , one after another , were jumping in after them to try to get them out . Klingensmith distinctly saw two men enter the pit , but ironically he was not sure which two they were . " Why did they jump in the hole without masks ? " asks Urling . " I guess they thought they could hold their breath , " says Klingensmith . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no answer . " Ray Grundler whipped off a Ugh ( sweater he was wearing and wrapped it around his face like a mask . He seized a rope desperately . Klingensmith saw him too late . " Ray Grundler came running with the rope , " he says . " fie was going down in the hole . Me and another guy grabbed him  --  and then he just keeled over into the hole . We had him by the arm . He fell right out of our hands . " It is four o'clock and the maintenance crews are coming back in their trucks from various jobs out on the sky from the pit , certainly saving his life . Yes , but did they think he was just momentarily overcome and themselves in no imminent danger ? Or were they giving him a place on the ladder at the hazard , fully comprehended , of their own lives ? Heroism-or just a helping to establish , " Urling had said at the beginning of the day . Now he realizes that for all his experience lie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own city some men will be declared heroes , perhaps with financial aid to their kin . Other men , just as dead , equally brave , no less precious to their own , will get nothing . Such an uneven division of praise and hard cash will create as much bitterness as joy and pride . Yet to walk away would be unthinkable . Carnegie made his instructions clear : the survivors of heroes " should not suffer pecuniarily . " But equally clear is that the seemingly pleasant chore of dispensing praise and a rich man 's money also can he a Continued on page 98 hand ? That would take thinking about . Grundler seems clear enough . He went into the pit once for Ladasky , and a second time to try to get a line to the other men down there . He meant to save life , this is clear . But Zeleny and Letzkus : less clear . They were seen entering the pit , at best , out of the corner of someone 's eye . None of their words at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they intended to perform rescues ? There were several moments when desperate men were literally jumping into the pit , taking a risk that they could hold their breaths long enough to save a buddy - and yet no one precisely saw what they were about . A heroic moment-perhaps while everyone was looking the other way ! And the supervisor : the hardest case of all . No question but that he courageously entered the pit to try to help his men out-and gave his life for their sakes . But he was the supervisor ! Would they have been down there at all , if not for his decision ? And where were the masks , the lifelines ' ? Were they not his responsibility ? Or was he himself the victim of lax company procedures ? An ordinary man may he such a victim , but not a hero : he would insist on safer procedures for his men , no matter how it affected his standing in the firm . " I once investigated a street cave-in in Chicago , " recalls Urling . " The rescuer -- who died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his men into the fix in the first place . I interviewed his superior later . The man was shocked . Some hero , he told me ! If the fellow were n't dead , he would have had him in jail ! " The Carnegie Fund happens to be adamant on the same point . One who causes the peril to others can be no hero . No matter that he atones at once by attempting rescue and sacrificing his own life . " This will be a hard case continued from page 90 Cooperative , Inc. , ( LIDFCI ) , which does their processing at a plant in Eastport . About 200 people , mostly women , work at the plant ; although the bulk of the labor is performed by specially crafted machines . Beginning at 5:30 a.m. on weekdays , double-decker trailers pick up ducklings from member farms and bring them to the plant , 1,000 to a truck . The ducks to be slaughtered are chosen with precision  --  all seven weeks and two days old , give or take a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from quack to freezer ( nearly all Long Island ducks are frozen these days ) , takes fifty-five minutes ; and during the peak summer season the plant can freeze 20,000 ducks a day . TIME TO EAT Each American consumes an average of two-tenths of a pound of duck per year . For turkeys , the figure is 8.2 lbs. , for chickens , 32.2 . Breathes there a recipe book that does n't offer a few ways to prepare duck ? The LIDFCI 's recipe booklet contains formulas for Duckling Stroganoff , Duckling Salad , Duckling Chow Mein , Duck Sandwich Filling , Duckling Hash , Duckling Casserole and Duckling Tetrazzini . SOFT FEATHERS , COLD FEET The feathers are sold , at sixty-seven cents a pound wholesale , to make pillows and sleeping bags and such . It takes four and one-half ducks to make one pound of feathers . The feet and lower legs are shipped frozen to the Orient , where they are deboned , stuffed with meat , vegetables and spices , cooked and served as a great delicacy . The viscera become a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the duck business say , " It 's all used except the quack . " It 's a good thing : If it were n't for the by-products , the price of duck would go up . ESCAPE TO THE POND When you see a white duck in a pond on Long Island , it 's an escaped Pekin , or rather , a Pekin set loose . Long Island boasts a good Easter trade in baby ducklings ( fourth favorite pet purchase ) , that have a habit of growing into larger ducklings and then full-fledged ducks . At some point along the way , mommy and daddy decide enough is enough and let little Donald ( or some such imaginative name ) loose on the nearest pond . There he or she stays for the rest of his or her days . NON-FROZEN DUCKS About 5 percent of Long Island ducklings are shipped live , for kosher killing , or they are " New York dressed , " which means just defeathered and blood-drained , mainly for the Chinatown trade . Before the age of freezers , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shipped in ice-packed apple barrels . FOOLING WITH FAKES Decoy manufacturers sell fake ducks to hunters under trade names like DURA DUCK . These impostors are set in the water to attract real ducks , who drop in for a visit and get shot . Some hunters make their own decoys , with varying degrees of precision and of various materials . Duck-shooters report success in fooling ducks with tin cans and pieces of old tires . In some circles , fine painted wood decoys are considered collectors ' items and bring high prices . SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS Scientists use ducks for some experiments , finding them easy to hatch and care for and no great problem to get along with . When ducks are used in experiments they could be called guinea ducks , but they are n't . One chap earned a psychology Ph.D . at Columbia in 1968 with a research project , supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation , titled " Generalization and Preference on the Wavelength Continuum Following Monochromatic Rearing of Ducklings . " Medical people use duck eggs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UNSTATED HONORS Not much acclaim is given to the duck . Every state , for instance , has an official state bird : Alaska 's is the willow ptarmigan , New York 's the bluebird , Hawaii 's the nene . About the only honor ever bestowed on the duck is the naming of the Long Island Ducks , a hockey team . Ducks could use a good PR man . FINAL BIRD-BRAINED QUESTION Why ducks ? Why not ? continued from page 95 burden and a weariness ; for it at times requires the stern withholding of praise and money even when they may be passionately and pathetically anticipated . There is only one condition under which the twenty men in the carpeted office will be able to defend their decision in their own city . And that is if they are supported by an investigation of the facts as thorough , as fair , as airtight as human ingenuity can make it . Urling must make a study of the gas company 's own official reports and review all of its safety procedures . He must check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , too , to witnesses Klingensmith , Ranallo , and Ladasky with more questions . In addition , there will he all those widows to visit and interview . It has been a long day . The Carnegie investigator slouches in the car seat . But now it seems to him that there is just one design in the fact that he is the one agent back in Pittsburgh , and therefore available for this complex assignment . The most experienced man . And as it has done so frequently in the past , confidence in his craft comes to him again and lifts his energy and his spirit . The loose ends will have to he tied , the questions answered , the report blanks filled  --  if anybody is able to do it .
