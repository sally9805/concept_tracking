Less secrecy for the SAT <P> New York has scheduled a stiff high school graduation competency requirement for 1981 seniors , but there was more concern in the Empire State last week about another kind of testing-admissions exams for colleges and graduate schools . The issue : Should the questions and answers on these exams , which are traditionally wrapped in secrecy , be released for public scrutiny ? Yes , said New York 's Governor Hugh Carey , who signed a state law requiring that , as of next Jan. 1 , the tests be made public 30 days after students learn the results . No , said most of the national testing groups , including the Princeton , N.J. , Educational Testing Service , which administers the College Board 's Scholastic Aptitude Test , given annually to 1 million high school seniors . <P> The reason for opposition ? According to Robert Cameron , testing director of the College Board : " We do not have an inexhaustible supply of new questions . " ETS spends two years preparing each version of its 145-question SAT ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as copies of the test are hidden away in the files of ETS , they can be reused for approximately three years . " But , " notes Cameron , " once you disclose a test , it must be discarded . " New York 's new law will force makers of standardized tests to offer new examinations throughout the U.S. , for once the cat gets out of the bag in New York , test makers must assume it will slink across state lines . <P> Opposed by many of the state 's educators , the Carey decision was a victory for student and parent groups backed by Ralph Nader , who has encouraged " truth in testing " campaigns in California , Colorado , Texas , Ohio and Massachusetts , as well as New York . Carey 's move gave Nader his first signal victory , and last week Nader called the decision a " turning point in the national campaign to subject the testing industry to public scrutiny , " adding , " ETS has been judging the worth of students for years . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ETS . " The legislation also requires testing organizations to submit to government agencies any studies of how validly their tests measure aptitude . Naderites expect to use the data to scrutinize the impact of race and family income on test scores . <P> In the wake of Carey 's decision , ETS warned that extra research expense would lead to price increases of $4.75 for New York students , who now pay $8.25 to take the SAT . In addition , the frequency of makeup test days and special testing sessions for the handicapped may be cut . There was also opposition to the new law from the American College Testing Program and the Law School Admission Council , whose admissions tests are now subject to New York 's new statute , as are medical-and dental-school tests and the Graduate Record exams .
