txt The air hijackings by Arab commandos in the Middle East have caused a shrill public outcry for stronger antihijacking legislation on an international scale . They demonstrate the urgent need , too , for achieving a peace settlement that will include the Palestinians . In denouncing the current hijackings , UN Secretary U Thant referred to them as " savage and inhuman acts , " and called on the international community for prompt and effective measures to stop them . The Secretary-General said he had been in touch with the International Airline Pilots Association . U Thant said the hijacking of planes , blowing them up , and detention of passengers and crews " should be condemned in the strongest possible terms . . . . " At the UN General Assembly session last year , a strong hijacking resolution was effectively emasculated by some of the same forces that are supporting the Palestinian groups now engaged in increased hijacking . A provision for extradition of hijackers back to the country of flight origin of skyjacked planes was one of the clauses skillfully cut out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 24th General Assembly . Thus , the punishment of hijackers is effectively limited . If they land in friendly territories , they are apt not to be shipped back to the flight-origin country where they might be prosecuted . Prospects for a peace settlement that will satisfy the Palestinians are not the least bit encouraging here at the UN , on several counts : ? Palestinian guerrilla forces assert they are in no mood for the Jarring peace talks and intend to achieve their gains by force . The bombing and gutting of a Pan American jumbo 747 jet in Cairo by Palestinian liberation forces was said by them to be to protest Egypt 's acceding to a cease-fire and talks in New York . ? Israel has announced it is pulling out of the talks that had begun under Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring , personal representative of U Thant , until Egypt should withdraw Soviet missiles allegedly emplaced nearer Israel since the Aug. 7 cease-fire . ? The United States appears to be in no position to make either the Soviet Union or the United Arab Republic comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions . In fact , although the United States has said it verified by photographic surveillance the installation of new missile sites near the Suez Canal after the cease-fire had begun , the U.A.R. denied it violated the cease-fire . ? The Soviet Union has backed up the Egyptian denial by printing in Pravda statements that the U.A.R. has told the United States no new missile installations have been moved into the Suez Canal zone since the Mideast cease-fire went into effect . The Tass dispatch in Pravda said that " all missiles at the present time in the Suez Canal zone were there before the coming into force of the agreement on a temporary cease-fire . " The Pravda dispatch tends to leave the implication that the Soviet missiles already were in the forward positions at the time of the cease-fire . The Pravda article does not make clear whether the missiles were installed or set up after the cease-fire . This is left to conjecture . U.S. plan criticized Contrarywise , the United States statement on its photo surveillance of the missiles appears to suggest that the missiles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.-Israeli position from the Soviet-Egyptian statements and denials demonstrates again the weakness of the American cease-fire plan , UN delegates state . The plan made no adequate provision for neutral , or accurate surveillance of the cease-fire . The word of one side is no more verifiable than that of the other . // Hijackings rouse ire // Meanwhile , almost lost in the sensationalism of the hijackings was a Security Council Meeting Sept. 5 in which Israel was again condemned for raids into Lebanon . By a vote of 14 to 0 , with the United States abstaining , the Security Council demanded " the complete and immediate withdrawal of all Israeli armed forces from Lebanese territory . " . The Lebanese complaint said Israeli armed forces under heavy air support had penetrated inside Lebanese territory to a depth of seven kilometers , bombing civilian installations and opening roads for Israeli military use , permitting further expansionist operations . " The Israelis announced they had made the raids to wipe out Palestinian guerrilla groups which had been attacking Israel .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
