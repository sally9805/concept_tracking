In State of the Union , the 1945-46 Pulitzer prizewinning play by Russel Grouse and Howard Lindsay , a woman newspaper publisher asks an old Republican political boss : " Is there any real difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party ? " Cracks the pol : " All the difference in the world . They 're in-and we 're out ! " <P> In economic policy , the differences can be much more pronounced than that . This year they loom particularly large because after the election , many crucial decisions will have to be made on tax reform , the fate of wage and price controls , the trade-off between inflation and unemployment . How will the outcome of the election influence these decisions ? That question was examined by three members of TIME 'S Board of Economists : Walter Heller , who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson ; Beryl Sprinkel , a Republican and senior vice president of Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank ; and Harvard 's Otto Eckstein , a CEA member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELLER . The economy will be expanding nicely into 1973 no matter who is elected . But I do not mean that there is n't some philosophical difference between Democrats and Republicans on economic issues . There are five areas of disagreement . <P> No. 1 is the division between the private and public sector . The Democrats would support public programs-welfare , education , poverty-more generously than the Republicans . <P> No. 2 is willingness to intervene in private economic processes . There is no question that there will be a greater likelihood of wage-price intervention by Democrats than by Republicans . <P> No. 3 involves unemployment and inflation . The trade-off between more jobs and higher prices would differ with the two parties . If President Nixon is reelected , he would accept a higher level of unemployment-as a trade-off for a lower rate of inflation-than a Democratic President would . <P> No. 4 relates to the regulatory environment . The willingness to regulate more aggressively would be greater with a Democratic Administration . <P> No. 5 is income distribution . A Republican Administration would be much less likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close tax loopholes . <P> BERYL SPRINKEL . There would be more inflation under a Democratic Administration and , in the very short run , an average level of unemployment a little higher under a Republican Administration . Over the longer pull , I would argue that unemployment would be lower with the Republicans . They are likely to avoid a stop-go policy of stimulus and restraint-that is , they would tinker less with the economy . <P> Another very important issue is the size of Government . We hear a lot of discussion about unfair distribution of income . This is really a debate about how much of our total resources we want to allocate to Government . It seems to me that the American public is opting for less of their resources being allocated to Government , and this is the direction in which the Republican Party is moving .
