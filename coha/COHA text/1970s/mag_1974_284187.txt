Henry Kissinger 's success in the Middle East inevitably recalls his negotiations in another battleground : Viet Nam . By coincidence , the first " inside " account of those 3 years of talks and tribulations appears this week in the summer issue of the quarterly Foreign Policy . Written by former New York Timesman Tad Szulc , it offers an insight into the Secretary 's " brilliance , stamina and tactics . " Szulc pieced together his 47-page narrative from conversations with several officials involved in the peace effort-although not with Kissinger himself . Among the article 's principal points : <P> RUSSIANS TO THE RESCUE . As Szulc tells it , the Soviets played a much bigger role in salvaging the stalled Viet Nam negotiations than they have been credited with . The essential breakthrough came in the Soviet Union after the North Vietnamese launched their Easter offensive in 1972 . The Communist onslaught created " a sense of panic in the White House " that the Saigon regime might collapse . Kissinger , who went to Moscow in April to set up Richard Nixon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist Russian aid in containing the North Vietnamese drive . During his visit , Kissinger told the Russians that the U.S. would no longer insist on withdrawal of all North Vietnamese troops from the South after a cease-fire-a stunning reversal of the previous U.S. position . <P> In May , Kissinger returned to Moscow with Nixon for the summit . Viet Nam dominated one long , frosty session . At one point , Premier Aleksei Kosygin turned to Nixon and said : " You have Henry Kissinger . He 's a smart man . Why do n't you get him to find the right solution for the war ? " As the meeting dragged on , Nixon turned to Kissinger and whispered : " God , this can not go on like this . " <P> Next day Kissinger made another major concession : Viet Cong participation in a mixed tripartite commission to oversee new elections after a ceasefire . The Soviets were suddenly impressed with the U.S. determination to make peace . Brezhnev agreed to send Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny to Hanoi to urge resumption of the secret Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians are going to help us . " <P> MAN IN A HURRY . When the North Vietnamese finally responded to the U.S. concessions and produced a draft agreement in Paris on Oct. 8 , Szulc claims , Kissinger fairly grabbed at it . He instructed three staffers to write a counterproposal , then went out to a dinner date . The aides finished at 3 a.m. and went off to sleep , leaving the document for Kissinger . He awakened them at 8 a.m. , raging that the draft was much too tough . " You do n't understand , " he said . " I want to meet their position . " All through that critical week Kissinger kept up a furious pace . Said one American official : " Henry was rushing things too much ; it was getting too sloppy . " <P> USING ( AND MISUSING ) SECRECY . Szulc says that Kissinger made an obsession of secrecy as he shuttled between Washington , Paris , Moscow , Peking and Saigon largely because he wanted to " keep everybody off balance , " the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is possible that even Nixon did not fully understand at all times " what Kissinger was doing .
