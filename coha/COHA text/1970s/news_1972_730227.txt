txt The barriers at last have been brushed aside here on the border between two nations so often foes in the past . One aspect of European d  --  tente is visible in the stream of cars with East European number plates rolling up toward this Polish frontier post and into what were once Germany 's " western territories . " No more barricade No matter that the occupants are citizens of the Communist German Democratic Republic , an ally with Poland in the Warsaw Pact . It has taken two decades , from thetime that East Germany recognized Polish sovereignty over the territories until this year , to achieve the new 300-mile " open " border . The bar which formerly blocked the road until each traveler had undergone a lengthy scrutiny is raised . It has been up since Jan. 1 , and now is rarely lowered . Motorists , traveling both ways , already have made 2 million visits this year . On one recent holiday , traffic built up into a line of Polish cars nearly two miles long . And now a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its treaty with Poland means in Polish eyes that Bonn at last also recognizes Poland 's western border along the Oder-Neisse rivers ; that Bonn too accepts permanent Polish sovereignty over the 39,000 square miles of territory relinquished by Germany of World War II . // *Germans , Poles raze iron curtain // That being so , they are prepared to ease the welcome mat for West Germans , too . Following the four-power accord over Berlin and the agreement between the two Germanys opening East Germany to West German visitors , they plan , in fact , to make it easier for the latter also to visit Poland by issuing them visas on demand at the border . This will mark another stage of this quite remarkable effort toward reconciliation between the Poles and the foe they have had to fear for 10 centuries and at whose hands ( as President Nixon acknowledged during his Warsaw visit ) they suffered more than any in the last war . We talked about it with Josef Janusiewicz , editor of the Szczecin daily Glos Szczecinski , a dynamic young newspaperman whose ap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Szczecin following the stormy events there in December , 1970 . " Two historic enemies , " he said , " are moving now toward a state of integration in a very real sense . The ' open ' frontier with the G.D.R . has brought about a wholly new psychological outlook , especially among our young generation . " They feel that the European Economic Community opened the frontiers in Western Europe , and now at last that is happening with us ; and it is this opening of borders between nations that the young generation desires . " This free movement over the frontier for ourselves and the East Germans has , moreover , important economic as well as political gains . " Reduced to the simplest terms , it means , for example , that Polish housewives can shop in two currencies and in two markets ? at home and in the G.D.R . It means in practice , for example , that they are buying East German furniture ? and truckloads of it are being imported here ? simply because it is better than our own products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , already feeling the draught of this competition and will have to improve its own products or close down . " This kind of challenge is a two-way thing . German visitors apparently take home supplies of Polish bread and " then ask their own bakers why they ca n't make loaves as good ! " Exchanges between Poland and the G.D.R . are burgeoning in other ways . Technicians and skilled workers are involved . Polish workers are engaged , for example , on construction sites at Stralsund , on the East German Baltic . ( And West German workers , incidentally , have been hired from Bavaria to help with the restoration of some of this region 's war-damaged ancient buildings . ) As with the blocs , the Poles do n't expect old emotions and memories to fade overnight . " That still must be a question of time , " said Mr. Janusiewicz . " You must remember there was hardly a family in Poland that did not have at least one member killed by the Nazis . " In our hotel in Szczecin that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party showed clearly two generations . Members of an older one , it transpired , who had lived in what had been German Pomerania , bringing children of teen-age or early 20 's simply to see where their parents had come from . To the Poles their presence was a natural part of the new trends in Europe , trends in which they , with justice , feel they have a special part .
