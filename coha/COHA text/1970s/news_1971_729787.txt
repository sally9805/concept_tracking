txt " if you foreigners would send us the arms and ammunition we need , we could throw out the Pakistan Army in seven days , " the guerrilla officer said . " As it is it will take a bit longer . " There was a murmur of assent from the half-dozen East Pakistani separatist guerrillas seated around a flickering hurricane lantern in a small house . A cyclone sideswiping the eastern region was driving monsoon rains through cracks in the straw thatching and everyone was covered with the thick clay that accompanies foul weather in Bengal . In the face of a fairly wellequipped army of 70,000 men supported by armor , artillery and planes , such claims are clearly overoptimistic . It is equally apparent that , despite the Pakistani Army 's firepower , it is fighting a long and increasingly bloody war of attrition against the movement that calls its homeland Bangla Desh ( Bengal Nation ) . Under the precepts of warfare laid down by such Asian strategists as Mao Tse-tung , East Pakistan is a guerrillas ' heaven , with the terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bahini , or Liberation Fork .... Last Pakistan is almost completely bounded by India , which is bitterly hostile to the Pakistani Army and which not only provides bases , arms and training for the guerrillas but also pins down most of the army along the border by pounding the Pakistanis with daily artillery barrages . This guerrilla hamlet , in common with many rural communities in the deltaic flood plain of East Pakistan , is a good 20 miles from the nearest road or footpath . It is accessible only through a maze of shallow canals clogged with water plants and offering innumerable positions for ambushing intruders . This correspondent , traveling on a motor launch and a sampan , was escorted to the hamlet by a guerrilla guide . At the request of the residents , the location of the hamlet , which is south of Dacca , is not being specified . Guerrillas in " liberated zones " like this one feel completely secure from army operations and their houses display Bangle . Desh posters and portraits of the imprisoned Bengali leader , Sheik Mujibur Rahman . Strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this zone with the regional capital at Dacca are careful to lower the Pakistani flag soon after leaving the docks there . Failure to fly the flag in Governmentcontrolled areas can result in death or the destruction of property at the hands of the army , but flying it in guerrillacontrolled zones can be equally dangerous . An exact knowledge of where one zone ends and the other begins is important to everyone in East Pakistan . As a rule of thumb , foreign diplomats and military observers consider that about a quarter of the region is controlled by the guerrillas , who claim a force of at least 100,000 men . But even in the heart of army-occupied territory Pakistan control is tenuous . When traveling with guerrilla agents in Dacca or elsewhere , an elaborate system of signals and clandestine arrangements smoothes the way past any potential military obstacle . Seemingly , the entire population other than the troops from West Pakistan are in on the conspiracy . " Operating this far from the Indian border we suffer from some obvious disadvantages , " said a guerrilla captain who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( border areas most of our fighters are able to go to India for training and to bring back weapons . But here very few of our guerrillas have been to India and we have a chronic shortage of arms . " " In common with all guerrilla movements , " he continued , " we capture our arms from the enemy . But the enemy rarely ventures into our territory and he has no outposts we can overrun " Severe Shortage of Arms Another guerrilla officer explained that local units were organized in 40-man platoons comprising 4 squads of 10 men each . " We have arms enough for only one guerrilla in four at the moment , " he said , " so we rotate squads on operations , transferring guns . We have explosives , but our biggest lacks are automatic weapons , machine guns and heavy weapons such as recoilless rifles . " Questions on how the chain of command works are evaded . An officer , asked about the location of Mujibnagar , the proclaimed capital of " the People 's Republic of Bangla Desh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mobile capital . " Communications between guerrilla districts are said to be rapid and reliable . During this correspondent 's visit a courier arrived from a distant zone carrying a plastic case sealed against the mud and rain and containing battle directives , propaganda posters and copies of the mimeographed Mukti Bahini newspaper . Three Levels of Organization " Broadly speaking , " a guerrilla surgeon said , " we are organized in three levels . " We have a sabotage unit which mainly works against power lines , bridges , railroads , vital services in cities and , of course , all military and police organizations .. destroyed recently . But we make them pay for it . " The insurgents told how an untrained unit annihilated an amphibious army raiding party several weeks ago . " We were all green at the time , but common sense and the reading of textbooks helped us considerably , " a former student related . " There 's a sharp bend in the river near here , where we had been waiting in ambush for days , Eventually the enemy launches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both banks . " " Some brave boys ire the sapper group had made bombs , " he said , " by tying together quarter-pound blocks of PK high explosive . While the troops were pinned down by our fire from the banks , the sappers swam out with charges in their hands , throwing them into the launches only after the fuses were almost entirely burned , and quickly diving under water , " We sank the launches and killed the troops . " He said that the army attacked again and there was " constant fighting " for three days , but that by Oct. 28 the guerrillas had killed nearly 150 soldiers . " We lost some people , but on balance we won that fight , " he added . There is confusion on policy and ideology as orders are passed down the guerrilla ranks . ' Sheik Mujib Is Dead ' The Government forces , which occasionally use helicopters effectively in assaults on guerrilla strongpoints , rely a great deal on a civilian volunteer militia called razakars ? young men aged 14 and up who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not entirely trusted by the Government  --  they are said to be surrendering in substantial numbers  --  are armed only with old bolt - action rifles and a few cartridges each . A senior guerrilla officer , asked about policy toward the razakars , said : " We welcome them all . We need all the fighters we can get regardless of what they have done in the past , and if they have come mitted civil crimes , they can be settled by civil courts once we have an independent Bangla Desh . " But a guerrilla of the . line replied : " If a razakar comes to us with his weapon we welcome him . If he comes to us unarmed , he is probably an enemy - spy and we kill him . " Generally speaking the officers and men show little interest in politics and reply vaguely when asked about their objectives . A captain gave a typical response , saying : " Bangla Desh will be a democracy . We hear talk about Maoist leaders taking over the movement , but as far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea is to create an independent , democratic Bengali state . The details we can work out after victory . " The guerrillas ' indifference to specific political goals appears to extend to Shiek Mujib , the elected leader of the Bengali ( nationalist movement , who is 011 Lid ! fun ** and jii West Pakistani jail . " As far as we are concerned Sheik Mujib is dead , " a guerrilla explained . " Once he fell into the hands of the enemy he died as leader of Bengali independence . If he were released as the result of some deal with the Islamabad Government , Ile would want us to kill him and we would kill hire . " " Sheik Mujib lives in all of us , and whether he lives or dies , his fighting spirit will never be extinguished , " the guerrilla said . The Mukti Bahini acknowledges that it lacks arms but says shortages are more than offset by mass Bengali support . The leaders , showing marked aversion to efforts by the United Nations and other organizations to provide humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the Government as a political tool , with the East Pakistanis getting none of it . " Do n't blame us if you foreigners get killed , " a ' guerrilla Said . " Second , we have the guerrillas , who ordinarily confine themselves to small-unit actions . Each liberated village trains its own guerrilla force , and usually we have instructors from the former East Pakistan police , the East Bengal Regiment or the East Pakistan Rifles . " Third , we have the front fighters  --  our divisional units , which will fight the final battles with large units of the Pak Army . " " So far . " he added , " the guerrillas have done most of the work . " The army , which has been trying since March 25 to subdue the Bengali nationalist movement , carries out constant punitive raids into the many rebel zones but rarely seeks to occupy them . " They ca n't get at us here , " a guerrilla said , " but along the banks of deep rivers villages are exposed to army launches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
