The day is already 15 hours old , with no end in sight . The chartered Jet-Star shudders in powerful headwinds . It will be midnight or after when you reach your destination , the national convention of the Young Democrats in Hot Springs , Ark . You were supposed to speak at noon , but the Senate was voting on campaign financing , and you could not get away . They put you over to the evening banquet , but you could not make that , either . Here you are , Hubert Humphrey , age 60 , twice a mayor , a national political figure since 1948 , four times a Senator , for four years Vice President , once your party 's candidate for the presidency . You have been through all this before-the long days , luncheons , dinners , chartered flights , delays , hotel rooms , limousines , taxicabs , interviews , speeches , baby kissing , crowds big and small , jostling , jeers , small-time pols who have to be humored , contributors who think they own you because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others know , that you will go through it ail again-// you can . <P> SUCH were the reflections of TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey as he accompanied Humphrey on one more political swing not long ago . No question , Humphrey is back and running hard for the nomination . He is well down the road toward announcing his candidacy for 1972 . So far this year he has traveled to 31 states , talking with trade associations , labor delegations , youth groups , and of course party politicians . Humphrey , who lost the presidency to Richard Nixon in 1968 by a mere half-million votes , insists that his chance for a second nomination is good . He eagerly points out that he has consistently been ranked " no worse " than third , and in the last Gallup poll , he was tied with Kennedy behind Muskie . He says that he is not alarmed by the competition . He explains : " I 'm not so sure one man dominates the scene completely . " <P> But can Humphrey himself come to dominate the race for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate in 1970 , he still carries the stigma of a loser who might not be able to win against a Nixon equipped with a series of presidential successes . Humphrey claims that on the Viet Nam issue he has as " good " a record since 1968 as any of the potential candidates . But there are those on the party 's left who will never forgive him for not breaking with Lyndon Johnson over Viet Nam in the 1968 campaign . A Humphrey nomination could very possibly send them scurrying to a fourth-party movement . Besides , as Humphrey freely admits : " I 'm not the new boy on the block . I 'm not the prettiest face in town . " Party leaders , nevertheless , give him more than an outside chance for the nomination .
