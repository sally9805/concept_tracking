One of the odd notes in Paris fashions this spring is the maternity-style top - for women without child . It has a loose , comfortable style that was born of the peasant blouses still available in the bazaars of Europe . If that is n't enough to give the nonpregnant pause , two young Manhattan women have designed and are selling the Pregnancy Puff-an egg-shaped , beige satin pillow that ties on round the middle with pink and blue satin ribbons . It has just one function : worn under clothing , it makes a woman look pregnant . <P> Why would anyone pay $20 ( a deluxe model , custom made and bearing the face of a loved one , sells for as much as $50 ) for the Pregnancy Puff ? There are practical reasons , insists K.T. Maclay , a married writer who invented the P.P. jointly with Unmarried Designer Linda Sampson . For one thing , she insists , it almost guarantees the wearer a seat on a crowded bus . For another , it is a surefire conversation piece at a cocktail party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her 17-year-old daughter to wear on a cross-country car trip , explaining that " she 'll be safer if people think she 's pregnant . " <P> There are psychological advantages too . " You feel your whole psyche changing when you wear one , " says K.T. " We have n't had backaches or varicose veins , but we 've developed some strange cravings . " Adds Linda : " I 've stopped chewing gum . A Madonna figure should n't chew gum . " The Pregnancy Puff also seems to affect the beholder . " People think we 're pregnant and tell us how great our complexions look , " explains K.T. " They tell us we glow . And maybe we do , because we have this funny secret . " <P> <P> Raising the Roof <P> Olde England-the phrase conjures visions of red-cheeked lads frolicking with shy maids , of nut-brown ale bubbling in pewter flagons , and sturdy oak-beamed , thatched-roof cottages . These days , the red-cheeked lads and shy maids are living it up in Chelsea , and the nut-brown ale is thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or straw are back in style . The British government is acting to preserve the best examples , and the thatchers themselves - an independent breed that was dying out-suddenly have more work than they can possibly handle . <P> Until a decade ago , thatchers and their roofs were among England 's more conspicuous anachronisms . " Rural landowners , " says Thatcher John Dodson , " were pushing the old cottages over , or burning them because they were n't wanted . " Now the surviving thatched structures , many built in the 16th and 17th centuries , are fetching dazzling sums on the market . A small , shabby cottage that might have brought $1,000 as recently as 1962 now sells for 20 times that price ; larger houses , often short of plumbing but with two or three bedrooms , go for about $50,000 . <P> Why the belated boom in thatched roofs ? " It 's the London people who are coming out here , " says Dodson , " buying their weekend cottages and fixing them up . " Explains Designer-Photographer Sir Cecil Beaton , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden walls : " I champion beauty and impracticability. "
