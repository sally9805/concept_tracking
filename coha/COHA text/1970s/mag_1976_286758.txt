&gt; Though numerous hirsute plaintiffs have gone to the U.S. Supreme Court , the Justices had steadfastly refused to get enmeshed in long-hair disputes . But last week the court finally faced the matter and trimmed some individual rights-at least for policemen . Suffolk County police on Long Island had objected to regulations that banned beards , flared sideburns and hair that went over the collar . Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan agreed with the officers that the 14th Amendment 's " liberty " guarantee protected them since " an individual 's personal appearance may reflect , sustain and nourish his personality . " But William Rehnquist , writing for a six-Justice majority , said drily that where the state 's standard is not " so irrational that it may be branded arbitrary , " the individual 's rights must bend " to the overall need for discipline , esprit de corps and uniformity . " The nation 's police could reasonably have expected a more tolerant view from Rehnquist : his own sideburns and locks would not pass the Suffolk County standards . <P> &gt; In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal aftermath of the My Lai massacre by refusing to review the case of former Army Lieut . William Calley Jr . Galley 's 1971 court-martial conviction for the murder of 22 Vietnamese civilians in 1968 had been thrown out by a federal district judge , then reinstated by a federal appeals court , whose decision now stands . Of 25 Army officers and enlisted men charged with My Lai-related offenses , only Calley was convicted ( two generals were censured ) . His original life sentence was reduced by Army authorities to ten years ; he was freed pending appeal after serving nearly a third of that term , and the Army has said it would parole him if his appeal failed . <P> - Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln had four children , only one of whom , Robert , had any children . In turn , only one of those three children , Jessie , had a child , and that sole offspring , Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith , has only one child , Timothy , now seven , who is therefore Abe Lincoln 's only direct descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in court denying he is the boy 's father . In England such a hassle might well involve a title . In the U.S. the issue is a divorce-and perhaps a trust fund worth more than $ 1 million . Beckwith , 71 , and his 27-year-old estranged wife Annemarie Hoffraarr Beckwith have been fighting over a divorce for three years , each alleging adultery . <P> Now the District of Columbia 's Court of Appeals has ruled that the boy , who lives in West Berlin with his mother , must undergo a blood test to help check Beckwith 's claim of non-fatherhood-which would prove her adultery . As it happens , the trust fund , which was established by Lincoln 's daughter-in-law ( Beckwith 's grandmother ) , could eventually go to the boy even if he is not Beckwith 's . The reason is that in any subsequent case directly concerned with Timothy 's legitimacy , the law would still be heavily weighted toward finding that when a woman gives birth , her husband is the child 's father . Thus even if little Beckwith could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the million dollars to soothe his disappointment .
